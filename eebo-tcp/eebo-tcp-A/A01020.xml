         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Ourteous Reader, to seeke thy approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Booke by any
faire &amp; plausi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble inductions, were to distrust, if not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire the worth
of it. 'Tis folly to light a Candle to the Sunne, as likewise to praise that,
which in it selfe is all praise worthy. True Vertue needs no Orator to set her
foorth; her owne natiue beautie is so moouing, that outward trappings can
afoord her small aduantage. If the diuine conceits and meditations of
Antiquitie can worke vpon thy Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, I make no doubt but here's enough to
win thee. The whole Booke is nothing but a bunch of flowers collected from out
those pleasant Gardens, which were long since planted by the art and industrie
of those re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerend Fathers, whom God raised vp for Guardians to his Church,
during hir nonage and minoritie. If the sent of these shall please thee, the
Translator will hereafter furnish thee with the Labors of the same Author vpon
all the Parables.</p>
            <p>Some peraduenture may dislike it, because it was first composed by
a Spaniard; as if <hi>Eliah</hi> should haue refused his meat, because it was
brought him by a Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen; or that in a curious Fountaine, where there are some
spouts formed like the heads of Serpents, others, like those of Doues, the
water that issued out of either were notall one. The antient Gaules had no
sooner ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted the delicious wines of Italy, but a desire tooke them 
<pb facs="tcp:22083:4"/> to goe and conquer the Countrey: the like had beene wrought vpon
the Israelites, when some of those, whom <hi>Moses</hi> by the appointment of
God himselfe,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Num.</hi> 13.23</note> had sent to view the
fruitfulnesse of the land of Canaan, brought them of the Grapes, Figs, and
Pomegranats, which the soyle affoorded; if others had not marr'd this reall
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration with a vaine suspition of the sons of <hi>Anak.</hi> But what,
shall not the corne be reaped because there's cockle in the field? Shal not the
rose be pluckt because it grows on a Brier? And yet let me tell thee, to
hearten thy aduenture against all needlesse &amp; imaginarie fears, The captiue
here hath her head shorn, and may well be admitted for a true Israelite. Thou
shalt not cry out, <hi>Mors in olla, Death is in the pot</hi>; that little
leafe of <hi>Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quintida</hi> which was in it, is taken out, and the children
of the Prophets may tast of the broth without danger.</p>
            <p>Others it may be, wil condemne it as defectiue, because such
proofes &amp; passages as are alledged out of the fathers are not quoted in the
margent; &amp; indeed they should not haue bin wanting, but that in the Spanish
copy, they were found vpon good perusall (whether through the negligence of the
Printer, or some other default) to be so mistake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that to haue set them down,
would haue occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned trouble rather than content: but if euer the Booke come
to a second impression, all things shal be added, for the satisfying of thy
desires to the full. Meane while ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of this, and let it be thy Christian
ioy, That the lis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Ephramite is heard here to speake as plaine as the
smooth-tongu'd Canaanite; and that there is not so great a distance betwixt
Hierusalem and Samaria, as some imagine. And so I leaue thee to the blessing of
the Highest.</p>

placed there in their stead, bones, skulls, and the ashes of dead men. Whose

            <p>When God reuealed to <hi>Nebucadnezar,</hi> how little a while his
Empire was to last, he shewed him a statue of diuers mettalls, the head gold,
the brest siluer, the bellie brasse, the legges yron, the feet clay, and a
little stone which descended from the mountaine, lighting on the feet, dasht
the statue in pieces. But in stead of taking this as a forewarning of his end,
and to haue it still before his eyes, he made another statue of gold from top
to toe, which is held to be a durable and lasting mettal: so that the more God
sought to dis-deceiue him, the more was he deceiued with his vaine hopes. And
this is a resemblance of that which dayly hapneth vnto vs: for God aduising vs,
that our best building is but durt, our idle thoughts &amp; vaine hopes imagine
it to be of gold. And mans life being so short, that, as <hi>Nazianzen</hi>
said, it is no more than to goe out of one graue to enter into another, out of
the wombe of our particular mother, into that of the common mother of vs all,
which is the Earth; we flatter our selues with the enioying of many long yeres
of life. But the Church being desirous to cut off this error, saith,

<hi>Hierome</hi> saith, That in stead of <hi>Tau</hi> the Samaritanes did vse
the figure of a crosse. The Hebrews by this letter vnderstand the end, as
beeing the last in the ABC. And God was willing that those that bore this marke
in their forehead (that is, should haue their end before their eyes) should
liue; but that those that liued forgetfull of their end, that they should die.

<hi>Caine</hi> the death of the soule, for to quicken his memorie. From
<hi>Adam</hi> we inherit this forgetfulnes, not remembring to day what we saw
but yesterday; &amp; the general desire of man striues all it can to perpetuate
our life, which if it were in our hands we would neuer see death. But because
the loue of life should not rob vs of our memorie, and that fearing, as we are
mortall, wee might couet those things that are eternall, seeing that walles,

it should be able to indure it? if thou shalt not take pitty of this poore
piece of earth, this crazie vessel of clay, what will become of thy mercie of

  as Death doth mortifie andmake the flesh of Birds and Beasts more tender; so
  doth it soften in men their hard bowells, and causes pittie in their Soules,
  and is the Key that openeth their close-fistednesse. We read of certaine Fooles

  then that Christians should suffer much, who so much desire to bee the Bread,
  the Vessells, the Stones, and the Sacrifice for Gods House and his owne
  Table.</p>
               <p>The second point is, That our Repentance should be decent and

               <p>Two things are to bee considered in our Repentance: the one, The

  a great inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, as Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> noteth it: And Saint

                  </note> Not that humane weaknesse can make

  pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion. The councel of <hi>Agatha</hi> declareth the custome that was vsed

  is spoyled for want of water, so is it marr'd by too much. Our life is a tender
  Flower, and stands vpon a feeble stalke, <hi>Qui quasi flos egreditur &amp;

               <p>Likewise there must be a care had to the season, for the cure:
  As often there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as a man shall find himselfe wounded by sinne, so often
  must hee apply the plaister of Repentance. And as to deferre the cure in a

  Repentance from day to day.</p>
               <p>There are three differences of Time, Time past, present, and to
  come; that which is past is no more; that which is to come is in Gods hands,
  and that hee should bestow it vpon vs is his liberalitie and goodnesse; the
  present is but short, and for ought I know I may presently die. And herein is
  mans madnesse seene: for there is scarce that man to bee found, that thinkes it
  now to day a good time to repent him of his sinnes, but with the Crow cries

               <p>The Church teacheth, that we should not procrastinate our

  lost his way to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne into it againe, though it be through bushes and
  briars; hee that suffereth shipwracke to escape, if he can, vpon a planke:
  &amp; last of all, he that loseth a thing of value will endeauour to find it
  out againe, though it cost him a great deale of paine and trouble: yet all
  these losses are farre lesse than those of a sinner. Hee is fallen into the
  mire of sinne, and findes no helpe in the earth to lift him vp; he is sicke,
  but no physicke of <hi>Hypocrates</hi> nor <hi>Galen</hi> can recouer him; he
  is blind, but yet cannot get his sight; he hath suffered shipwrack, and can
  take hold of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in this sea of the world to saue him; he hath lost a
  jewell of that inestima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble value, whose losse is a losse of losses, &amp; the
  sum of all miserie. Now if to day at this time we may repaire these our
  grieuous losses, it is our fault if wee grow carelesse and drowsie therein,

               <p>Here the Commentators make a stand. The Gospell indeering the
  poornesse of spirit, and other vertues of Fasting, speakes no word thereof,
  though it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suppose it, and prescribeth rules how it ought to be done. And
  the answere is, The greatnesse of the priuiledge of Fasting, whose noblenesse
  is so antient, that Christ supposeth the same, though hee speaketh not thereof.
  There are some Gentlemen in our State, of that antiquitie, that without shewing
  their Titles or their Priuiledges, no man will offer to question them. Others
  there are, howbeit noble, either through emulation, or that they are not so
  antient, are driuen to prooue their Gentilitie. Against some vertues, some
  Emulators haue not stucke to speake; but against Fasting no man euer opened his
  mouth. <hi>Mahomet</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe neuer denied the noblenesse of Fasting, but
  rather so much recommended it, that our fastings should be ashamed to stand in
  competition with theirs.</p>
               <p>And therefore it is said, <hi>Cum jeiunatis, When yee fast,
  &amp;c.</hi> And anon after, <hi>Tu au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem cum jeiunas, But thou when thou
  fastest.</hi> There are such forcible and precise ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments vpon this point,
  that it were a superfluous labor to aduise whither it be to be done or no, when
  as it is aduised how it ought to be done. Heare S. <hi>Paul,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31.</note> 
                  <hi>Siue comedatis, siue

  <hi>Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yee eat or drinke, or whatsoeuer yee doe, let all be done to the
  glorie of God.</hi> He doth not aduise you vnto it, for that were a kind of
  force and constraint; but tells you how it ought to be done. As that it were a
  superfluous thing to aduise a man that is sore sicke, to obserue a dyet; or one
  whose house is on fire, to cast water thereon; or him that payeth money, to
  take an Acquittance; or him that enters the Church, to kneele when he comes in:
  so it were a needelesse thing to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand a man to fast, who from the beginning
  of the world tooke a furfet of ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. Niniuie was saued by fasting.
  <hi>Ioel</hi> proposeth the like meanes, when he cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vnto the people,

               <p>When the Law of Grace was first published through the
  world,<note place="margin">The antiquit of Fasting.</note> Fasting was
  proclaimed, <hi>Venit Iohannes non manducans nec bibens,</hi> i. <hi>Iohn came
  neither eating nor drinking.</hi> He is said not to come eating, for that he
  did eat but little: as wee say <pb n="12" facs="tcp:22083:11"/> of him that is sicke, That
  he eats nothing, when he takes no more sustenance than will hold life and soule
  together. And the first step of our Sauiours penance for our sinnes, was
  fasting, in token that our first hurt came by eating. The first Law that God
  gaue man after that he had created him, was, That he should not eat of the Tree
  of knowledge of good and euill: wherein, tended the one, that man in this so
  great a happinesse should not forget that he had a Lord and Master; the other
  had an eye to the repairing of that his future fault, and that man might
  vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, that he should in fasting find a remedie for that hurt which came
  vnto him by eating. And as a wise Phisitian, feeling the sick mans pulse, finds
  out his il disposition, &amp; perceiuing that his sicknes grew from that ill
  ripened fruit, which euen to this day is not yet fully digested; did prescribe
  this <hi>Recipe</hi> as a medicine to cure this our maladie: to the end, That
  as man did eate to sickenesse, so hee might fast to health; and as Gluttonie
  did banish vs from Paradice, so Fasting might recall vs thither againe.</p>

  continued in the world, God did still better and inrich it with new things: The
  first day he created the Light; the second, Heauen; the third, Earth; the
  fourth, the Sunne, Moone, and Starres; the fifth, the Fishes of the sea, and
  the Fowles of the aire: and though hee gaue them his blessing, hee did not say
  vnto them, That they should eate. The sixth, Beasts of the field and Man: and
  giuing them licence to eat, the workes of God and the perfections of the world,
  were ended. Wherein God gaue man as it were a watch-word, that eating would be
  his vndoing. And (as Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> hath it) if in that so happie
  an estate Fasting was so necessarie, What shall it bee in this miserable
  condition of ours. Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> Disciples said vnto Christ, Master, why
  doe we and the Pharisees fast, and thy Disciples not? Hee answered, While the
  Bridegroome is present the children are not to weepe, but the time shall come
  wherein they shall not haue him with them, and then they shall fast &amp;
  mourne. The presence of our Sauiour, and the enioying of his most sweet
  companie, did bridle their appetites, and keep their soules in subiection; but
  in his absence he inferreth, that this must be done by Fasting.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Ciril</hi> saith, That Fasting is a greater Sacrifice

                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:22083:11"/>Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> attributeth

  &amp;c. Besides, it giueth great light vnto knowledge and wisedome: for
  Gluttonie is an euill disposition for inquirie of truth; <hi>Reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti sunt, qui
  obscurati sunt terrae,</hi> saith <hi>Dauid, They are full fed, and blind.</hi>
  For this cause <hi>Ceres</hi> the Goddesse of Aboundance, is painted with Poppy

  There is a twofold thirst, one false, the other true: there is likewise a

  when he was oppressed with hunger he did eat; the like may euerie good
  Christian doe: and therefore Saint <hi>Gregorie</hi> saith, That a man may

               <head>Be not like the hypocrites, &amp;c.</head>
               <p>This little short clause doth affoord three or foure seuerall
  kinds of sences:<note place="margin">What to bee obserued in Fasting.</note> The
  first, That wee must not onely doe good, but shunne euill; and therefore
  aduiseth those that fast, not to be like vnto those Hypocrites, whom the wind
  of Vaine-glorie rob'd of all the good they did. It seemeth that the Church and
  the Gospell in this agree: The Church telles vs, That we are Dust; the
  Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, That wee should beware of wind, that wee bee not carried away
  there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with; withdraw thy selfe out of the Street, and from thy doore, where the
  wind whisketh and blowes hard, and retyre thy selfe into thy house, and Fast in
  thy priuate Chamber; let not thy right hand know what thy left doth: Do not
  like these Hypocrites, publish not thy Fastings, thy Prayers and thy
  Almes-deeds in the Streets and open Market place, lest the wind scatter them
  away, and they bee no more seene or heard of. Saint <hi>Gregorie</hi>
  saith,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Greg. Mor. lib.</hi> 19. <hi>ca.</hi> 13.</note>
  That Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites die by the hands of those vices which they haue ouercome: they
  fast, and fasting kills them; they giue Almes, and their Almes-deeds are their
  destruction. <hi>Eleazar</hi> a most valiant Souldier slew an Elephant which
  bore vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his backe a Tower of wood, but the Elephant thus slaine chanced also
  to slay <hi>Eleazar</hi>: great pittie that so valiant a man should die, but
  more, that hee should die by the hands of the dead. Many Christian Souldiers
  there are, which doe braue and worthie deeds, ouercome great vices, yet die in
  the end by their hands.</p>
               <p>The second, That your Fastings, and your Good-workes are more
  from God than your selues; <hi>Non possumus cogitare aliquid ex nobis, Of our
  selues wee cannot so much as thinke.</hi> Mans pouertie is so great, that hee
  cannot come to so much as a good thought, and therefore may not make
  merchandise of that wealth which is none of his owne. But God is so free in the
  workes of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and so bountifull, that being at all the charge himselfe,
  hee giues thee all the gaine; onely hee will that thou giue the glorie vnto
  him, and take the <pb n="14" facs="tcp:22083:12"/> profit to thy selfe. That Workeman
  should doe ill, who hauing built a house with another mans Purse, should goe
  about to set vp his owne Armes vpon the Frontispeece. <hi>Iustinian</hi> made a
  Law, That no master-Workeman should set vp his name within the bodie of that
  building which hee made out of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers cost. Christ sets thee aworke, and
  wills thee to Fast, to Pray, to giue Almes; but, Who is at the cost of this so
  good and great a worke? God; thou hast all thy materials from him, the building
  is his, it is his Purse that payes for all: giue the glo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ie therefore, and the honor thereof vnto him;
  <hi>Gloriam meam alteri non dabo,</hi> i. <hi>I will not giue my glorie to
  another.</hi> Content thy selfe with Heauen, which is promised vnto thee if
  thou doost well, which is a sufficient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for any seruice that thou canst
  doe.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Hypocrisie in Fasting.</note>The third, That
  Fasting, Praying, giuing of Almes, done onely for Gods sake, is of that great
  price and estimation, that it is ill employed on any other than God. And for
  that God weighes all things in his hand as in a ballance, and knowes the weight
  of euery good worke, and the true value therefore; it grieues him that thou
  shouldst doe these good things for so vile and base a price, and is sorrie to
  see thee so poore and foolish a Merchant, that thou wilt part wirh that which
  is as much worth as Heauen to thee, for that which is lesse than earth; to wit,
  onely that the World may say, Such a one fasteth; Why doost thou thus crucifie
  thy flesh? Why debarre thy bellie of food? Why be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing readie to die for hunger,
  doost thou not eat? Why lift vp thy eyes to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen for so poore a thing as to
  winne applause vpon earth. <hi>Sterni lutum quasi au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> saith
  <hi>Iob</hi>: those works that are done for God, are gold; done for the world,

                     <hi>Iob.</hi> 41.30.</note> They lay vp this their
  treasure in the tongues and eyes of men, which is a chest that hath neither
  locke nor key vnto it.</p>
               <p>The fourth, That Fasting is a Plaister for our wounds, a
  Medicine for our griefes, a Salue for our sinnes, and a Defence against Gods
  wrath. But thou must take heed that thou doe not make this Plaister poison;
  this Medicine sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; this Salue a sore; and this Defence, our destruction.
  For where God hath a Church, there the Deuill hath a Chappell; and where hee
  throwes in seed, the other will sow tares. <hi>Naboth</hi> a Subiect of King
  <hi>Achab</hi> had a Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard in Samaria neere vnto the Kings Palace; the King
  had a mind vnto it; <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both</hi> will not part with it: the King growes
  sad, refuses his meat; <hi>Iezabel</hi> comes to see him, makes a jest of it;
  takes pen in hand, dispatches a Ticket to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernors of that Citie, sealed
  with the Kings Seale, to proclaime a Fast; sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ornes two witnesses to sweare,
  That they heard <hi>Naboth</hi> blaspheme God &amp; the King: the innocent
  <hi>Naboth</hi> is stoned to death, and his goods confiscated. In which action
  there are two things worthie our consideration: The one, That the circumstance
  of blaspheming God and the King vpon a solemne day of Fast, (as it is noted by
  <hi>Vatablus</hi>) was so grieuous, that of force hee must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to die
  for it, in so great veneration was Fasting in those dayes. The other, That it
  serued as a cloake for the taking away of the Vineyard, for the falsifying of
  witnesses, and injustice in the Iudges. Who should haue then seene the People
  to fast, would haue thought it had beene done out of zeale, Gods honour, and a
  desire to doe him seruice. But it was meerely a tricke of the Deuils, which hee
  had plotted with himselfe. Hee threw poyson vpon vertue, seeking to draw euill
  out of good. Wee must therefore beware, least these our good actions receiue
  hurt, by euill intentions.</p>

               <head>Like Hypocrites.</head>
               <p>Hypocrisie runnes a quite contrarie course to these foure points
  before spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, and crosses the same three or foure manner of waies.</p>
               <p>First, It feigneth the good which it hath not. As the proud Man,
  Humility; the Cholericke, Patience; the Wanton, Honestie; the Miser,
  Liberalitie. This leger-demaine is that which hath more generally spred it
  selfe through mens brests, being desirous that the bodie should serue for the
  soule, as painting for the face, which being blacke, makes it seeme white. The
  painted Image of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers colours (whereof <hi>Wisedome</hi> speaketh) stirreth
  vp in Fooles a kind of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and delight. This stampe, though it be there
  set vpon Idolaters, may bee truly set vpon Hypocrites, for the comparison will
  hold well in both. Hee that shall truly and steddily looke vpon the face of an
  Hypocrite, shall in him behold an Image flourished ouer with sundrie colours,
  but counterfeit and feigned; as the white of Chastitie, the watched of Zeale,
  the red of Loue. But this is but a dunghill couered ouer with snow: the
  Hypocrite sheweth teares in his eys, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion in his mouth, sorrowfulnesse in
  his countenance, and mortification in his flesh. But he is not the man he
  seemes to be: for the Painter, though he giue the Varnish of the colour, he
  cannot giue heate, nor life; hee may giue the likenesse, but not the truth of a
  thing: he painteth snow which is not cold, fire which doth not burne, birds
  which doe not flie, beasts which doe not goe: hee will paint a S.
  <hi>Hierome</hi> with a stone, but it shall neuer hit him on the breast; he
  will paint a Saint <hi>Francis</hi> with a discipline or whip in his hand,
  which shall neuer giue him so much as one stripe or lash on the bodie: like
  vnto that Statue which <hi>Michol</hi> put into <hi>Dauids</hi> bed, clad with
  his cloathes, which cosined the King and those that came with him: Or like vnto
  a dead man, which being beheld afarre off, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be aliue; or vnto
  <hi>Ezechiels</hi> Temple, which was fairely painted without, but within full
  of abhominations. A Painter, or a Statuarie frameth a verie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Image in
  the exterior parts, but the Picture doth not enter into the substance of the
  wood or marble. Nature beginneth with the inner parts,<note place="margin">Wherein dif<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fering from Faith.</note> it first fashioneth the
  heart, then it organeth &amp; giueth life to the other parts of the bodie.
  Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as feigned Repentance beginneth in the outward parts of the body; but
  true, in the inward parts of the soule. Our Sauiour in the Garden had first
  great sorrow in his soule, and from thence that sweat of bloud was deriued to
  his bodie. The Hypocrite hath the appearance of a Saint, the apparell of a
  Saint, the place of a Saint, the figure of a Saint, and nothing in him which is
  not Saint-like: but like those Assisters at Christs death, that had put on his
  cloathes: Hee that shall see a common Hangman with Christs seamelesse coate
  vpon his backe, wil take him to be a second Messias. When <hi>Iacob</hi> saw
  <hi>Iosephs</hi> coat dipt in bloud, thinking some wild beast had deuoured him,
  he cried out, <hi>Tunica filij mei est, fera pessima deuora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uit eum,</hi> i.
  <hi>'Tis the garment of my son, some cruell beasts hath deuoured him.</hi>
  Excellent words befitting a Garment like to our Sauiors Robes: it is the Robe
  of a Saint, but there is no more but the Robe, the rest that Beast Hypocrisie
  hath deuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. <hi>Ieremie</hi> treating of the Gouernors of his people,
  saith, That they labored to seeme Saints, but their wings were full of the
  bloud of the Poore; <hi>In alis suis inuentus est sanguis Pauperum,</hi> i.

  raiments of ambition, of couetousnesse, of wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse (which he will not
  strip himselfe of) he would haue the cloake of his loue to God, of hearing
  Sermons, of frequenting the Communion, of contemplation, of Prayer, &amp;
  Mortification. This is to sell a boxe of Ratsbane with a little anis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seed
  strow'd on the the top of it. In a word, As the Deuil doth transfigure
  him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe into an Angell of light, being but darkenesse it selfe; so the
  Hypocrite be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vice it selfe, would transforme himselfe into vertue and
  holinesse. But God hath sworne, that hee will plucke their maskes and visards
  from off their faces, and leaue them as naked as the Crow of other birds
  feathers, and that this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guise shall be laid open, and that the beames of
  his Sun of Iustice shal melt away this painting, as waxe melteth before the
  fire, and that euerie one shall appeare at last in his owne likenesse.</p>
               <p>The second, and that which is most hurtfull, Is to make publique
  holinesse the stalking horse to effect the better their secret villanies. This
  Imposture is proper vnto Hereticks, immitating therein the Pharisees,
  professing great zeale, and outward sanctimonie in their words and behauiour,
  that they may the better bring to passe their euill purposes. These men (saith
  <hi>Chrysologus</hi>) make warre against the Church <hi>Mucrone Virtutis, With
  the sword of Vertue</hi>: beeing like vnto Pirates, who set vp the Flagges of
  their enemies, that they may the more safely set vpon them, and come aboord
  them vnsuspected.</p>
               <p>The third is, To take away from good workes the good intention
  of them. They giue almes, but not with intent to relieue the Poore; they heare
  diuine Seruice, but not to complie with the Church; they fast, but not to
  mortifie their flesh, &amp;c.</p>

  a vapour, and the like, lasts but a little while; all which, are accommodated
  to our life: But a Point indureth much lesse. And therefore <hi>Iob</hi> sayth,
  That the ioy of an Hypocrite is but a Point. And if this bee their recompence,

                  <hi>Treasure not vp treasures to your selues on earth.</hi>
  Because some men may doubt, why men may not treasure vp Treasures vpon earth;
  Saint <hi>Hilarie</hi> by these trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures vnderstandeth humane glorie, which
  hee stiled before by the name of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, <hi>Receperunt mercedem suam, they
  receiued their Reward.</hi> And it agreeth well with that of Saint
  <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> who saith, That the desire to treasure vp &amp; grow
  rich, ariseth not so much from the daintinesse, the delight, commoditie, &amp;
  other blessings which treasures represent vnto vs, as vaine-glorie. Why should
  a man make him beds of gold, mightie huge cupboords of massie plate,
  vnnecessarie rich wardropes, and Armies (as it were) of seruants, seeing these
  neither augment his health, nor inlarge his life, nor giue him much the more
  content? It is a fop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie of pompe (saith <hi>Seneca</hi>) whose ioy onely
  consisteth in shewing it to the world. In a word, this idle foolish pompe,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Senec. Ep.</hi> 110.</note> is a sinne which leadeth many a
  noble prisoner away with him in triumph; Angells, Men, Kings, Prelates, High,
  and Low: and, as <hi>Thomas</hi> hath noted it, other vices carry away along
  with them the Deuills seruants; but this, Gods. S. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> cals
  it, The piracie of noble Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, &amp; the Mother of Hel, which she peopleth
  and inricheth with her children.</p>
               <p>Likewise, this treasuring vp, may bee vnderstood of all manner
  of humane goods: For all men doe generally agree in a kind of Hypocrisie; to
  wit, to <pb n="22" facs="tcp:22083:17"/> seeme that which they are not, &amp; to promise
  that which they doe not performe: great Teasure promiseth to our immagination
  great felicitie; but the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioying thereof discouereth more deceites than
  content. And therefore Christ aduiseth,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi>
 13.</note> That the hypocrisie of Riches should not steale away our hearts: he
  calls it <hi>Fallacia, Deceits,</hi> because all Riches are but lies and
  cosenage. <hi>Thomas</hi> expounding that place of

               <p>
                  <hi>Treasure not vp to your selues, &amp;c.</hi> In the first
  place, A man is not here forbidden to encrease his wealth by lawfull meanes:
  for besides that this is that generall occupation of the men of this world,
  Christ our Sauiour condemned the sloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full seruant that buried his Talent; and
  albeit all excesse in this kind is condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, yet an honest meanes is not
  reprehended. <hi>Diuitias &amp; paupertatem ne dederis mihi,</hi> i. <hi>Giue
  me neither Riches nor pouertie,</hi> said <hi>Salomon</hi>; &amp; peraduenture
  the Lord said <hi>Thesauros</hi> in the plurall number, to intimate, What
  should a man do with such great Treasures for so short a life?</p>
               <p>In the second, He doth not forbid fathers to treasure vp for
  their childeren; for Saint <hi>Paul</hi> licenceth them so to doe, <hi>Filij
  non debent thesaurizare parentibus, sed parentes filijs,</hi> i. <hi>Children
  are not to lay vp for the parents, but parents for the children.</hi> And God
  that ingraued in the brest of married men a desire of their Posteritie,
  ingraued likewise a desire of their thriuing, and augmentation of wealth. For
  it were a wofull case that a man should leaue his children to begge their bread
  at other mens doores: that which is forbidden, is a <hi>Thesaurizate

of Ammon.</hi> Not that hee himselfe slue him, but because hee willed his
Captaine <hi>Ioab</hi> to doe it. The Iewes tooke away our Sauiours life by the
hands of the souldiers, and though they would haue washt their hands of it,
with a <hi>Nobis non licet interficere quenquam,</hi> i. <hi>Tis not lawfull

the Lord of Life.</hi> And because God was the mediate cause of his death,
<hi>Dauid</hi> tels him; <hi>Tu vero repulisti eum destruxisti &amp;
despexisti,</hi> i. <hi>Thou hast broken him off, destroid him, &amp;c.</hi> In
a word; As hee that is married by a third person, is married by himselfe: And
as hee that speakes by another, speakes by himselfe, as Kings doe by their
Embassadors; and as hee that despiseth an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador, despiseth him that sent
him: and as our Sauiour sayth, <hi>Qui vos audit, me audit, &amp; qui vos
spernit, me spernit,</hi> i. <hi>He that heareth you, heareth me, and hee that
despiseth you, despiseth mee.</hi> So the Centurion procuring the Antients of
Caper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naum to speake to Christ for him; the Euangelist sets it downe, that hee
spake himselfe.</p>

no more can a Souldier without sinning. In matter of gluttony, they are
<hi>Bacchusses: Effundunt se in luxum &amp; epulas,</hi> saith
<hi>Tacitus</hi>; In matter of filthy lust <hi>Priapusses</hi>; In matter of
bragging and swaggering, men <pb n="25" facs="tcp:22083:18"/> that would make a shew to
outface <hi>Hector</hi> and <hi>Achilles,</hi> or <hi>Mars</hi> himselfe; such
as will breake glasse windowes, and threaten at euerie word to kill their poore
Host; but when the enemie comes vpon them, more feareful than hares, and betake
them to their heeles. The greatest crueltie that euer was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, was the
scourging and crucifying of Christ, <hi>And this the souldiers did</hi>; so
saith S. <hi>Iohn.</hi> In a word, that young man that lists himselfe for a
souldier, shakes hands almost with al kind of vertue. But to leaue this Theme,
that my discourse may not seeme tedious in the enumeration of their vices;
though among soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers there are a refuse kind of sort, which <hi>Quintus
Curtius</hi> calles <hi>Purgamenta vrbium suarum, The Off-scum of
Commonwealths</hi>; yet there are many of them that are valiant, discreet,
Christian, and religious. The Scripture maketh mention of three Centurions; one
<hi>Ioseph,</hi> Decurion, a noble gentleman, who was captain of a Roman
companie when our Sauiour suffered: who scorning the power and ill will of all
Ierusalem, went boldly to begge his bodie of <hi>Pilat,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Marke</hi> 15.</note> for to giue it burial. There was another
Centurion called <hi>Cornelius,</hi> who not knowing Christ, was so religious,
so full of good workes, so giuen to prayer, and so fearing God, that an Angel
was sent vnto him to illuminate his vnderstanding. Of another, S.
<hi>Mathew</hi> makes mention; who when the lights of Heauen were darkned, yet
his sight was so cleere, that hee saw Christ our Sauiour was the Sonne of
God,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.</note> 
               <hi>Vere filius Dei erat
iste</hi>: Besides this Centurion we now speake of, whose Faith our Sauiour did
admire. Saint <hi>Austen</hi> celebrates another Captaine, which in the midst
of Armes tooke wonderfull care to know the things of God. But that we may not
weary our selues with counting the good ones one by one, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen it selfe
hauing great Squadrons of souldiers; this may suffice to honor this kind of
Calling, not onely for it's Faith, but for it's loue and charitie. Many did
petition our Sauiour for their sicke brethren, children, and friends; but for a
Seruant this Centurion onely maketh suit.</p>
            <div type="part">

  <hi>Seneca</hi> seemeth to make the word Seruant to signifie Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencie,
  and that it is in the Maisters choice to make him either his friend or foe.</p>
               <p>In this matter there are some rules of prudence, nobilitie, and
  Christianitie.</p>
               <p>The first on the Masters part; who are to treat their seruant
  with much loue and kindnesse, like a brother, saith
  <hi>Ecclesiasticus:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eccl.</hi> 33. <hi>Eccl.</hi>
 7.</note> and in another place indeering it more, <hi>Sit tibi quasi anima tua,
  Let him be vnto thee as thy soule</hi>; or as the Greeke hath it, <hi>Sicut tu,
  As thy selfe. Horace</hi> calls a mans friend, The one halfe of his soule:
  <hi>Sicut viscera mea suscipe, Receiue him as my owne bowells,</hi> saith Saint
  <hi>Paul,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending his seruant <hi>Onesimus</hi> to
  <hi>Philemon.</hi> No man is a seruant by nature, and being that God might haue
  made thee of a master a seruant, how oughtest thou to respect thy seruant being
  a master? This noblenesse of nature shewed it selfe apparently in this our
  Centurion; <hi>Puer meus jacet, My child lieth sicke</hi>: hee cals his seruant
  Child, a word of loue and of kindnesse, and signifies in the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall, a
  Sonne. And Saint <hi>Luke</hi> doth expresse it with a great deale of
  tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, <hi>Erat illi pretiosus, Hee was deere vnto him.</hi> Condemning
  those masters which vse their seruants as they doe their shooes, who when they
  waxe old, and are worne out, cast them out vpon the dunghill. Saint
  <hi>Paul</hi> calles these, <pb n="26" facs="tcp:22083:19"/> 
                  <hi>Sine affectione, Men
  without compassion,</hi> who no sooner shall their seruant fal sick, but they
  presently bid away with him to the Hospitall: &amp; if at the day of iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
  God will lay to our charge, That wee did not visit the sick in other mens
  houses, What will become of vs in that day, when wee be charged with casting
  them out of our owne.</p>
               <p>The second, That all seruants are not so equall and alike, that
  they should deserue either like loue or vsage. <hi>Ecclesiasticus</hi> saith,
  That as fodder and the whip belong to the Asse; so doth meat and correction
  vnto a sloathful seruant: But euermore inclining more to lenitie than
  crueltie.</p>
               <p>The third, That a Master bee not sharpe and bitter: for there
  are manie like vnto Spiders, which turne all into poyson, good, and bad
  seruice; foolish, and discreete words, are all alike vnto them. With some
  ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters (saith <hi>Macrobius</hi>) snorting and spitting are accounted
  discourtesies &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciuilitie.<note place="margin">

 <hi>de decem cord.</hi>
                  </note> Saint <hi>Austen</hi> sayes, That it is a pride
  vnworthie mans heart, to looke to be serued with more respect by thy seruant,
  than thou doost serue thy God. If euerie one of thy fooleries and misdemeanors
  God should punish them with the rod of his wrath,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Senec.
 Epist.</hi> 47.</note> what would become of thee? <hi>Seneca</hi> writing to
  <hi>Licinius,</hi> tells him, That it is a great deale of wisedome and
  discretion in a Master, to vse his seruants well.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Alex.</hi> 3. <hi>Ped.</hi> 11.</note> And <hi>Clemens
  Alexandrinus,</hi> That a Master must not vse his seruants like beasts: &amp;
  that he that doth not now and then conuerse with them, and communicate his mind
  vnto them, doth not deserue to be a master.</p>
               <p>The fourth, That hee bee franke and liberall, and a cheerefull
  rewarder of his seruants labours. For if the light of Nature teacheth vs, That
  wee should bee good vnto our Beasts, a greater Obligation lyes vpon vs towards
  our Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants. <hi>Plutarch</hi> taxeth <hi>Cato Censorinus</hi> (amongst his
  many other vertues) of this one inhumane action, That hee sould away his Slaues
  when they were old and vnable to doe him seruice, as Gentlemen turne those
  Horses that were for their owne Saddle, to a Mill to grind, when they grow old
  and stiffe, and are not able to trauell as they were woont to doe. In a word, a
  Master must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, That albeit the seruants bee the foot, yet the feet are
  as needfull to goe, as the eyes to see. And the aduantage that the master hath
  of the seruant, is not of Nature, but fortune; not by his birth, for both haue
  <hi>Adam</hi> for their father on earth, and God in Heauen: Both of them say,
  <hi>Pater noster qui es in Coelis; scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes quoniam illorum &amp; vester
  Dominus est in Coelis,</hi> i. <hi>Our Father which art in heauen; knowing that
  both their and your Lord is in Heauen.</hi> Not in his bodie, for the Pope is
  made of no better dust than the poore Sexton; nor the King, than the Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.
  Not in regard of the Soule, for the price of their redemption were both alike:
  Not of the vnderstanding, for many slaues haue that better than they; as
  <hi>Aesop, Epictetus,</hi> and <hi>Diogenes</hi>: Not of vertue, for many
  seruants there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in exceed their masters.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Duties of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants.</note>But let vs descend
  now from the Masters, to the Seruants dutie, and what rules belong to them.</p>
               <p>The first rule is, Faithfulnesse, and Loue. <hi>Salomon</hi>
  saith, He that keepeth the Fig-tree shall eat the fruit therof;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Prou.</hi> 27.18.</note> so, he that waiteth vpon his master
  shal come to honour, Instancing rather in the Fig-tree, than any other, for
  it's sweetnesse and great store of fruit; in token, that he that shall sow good
  seruices, shall reap good profit.</p>
               <p>The second, That he do not serue principally for his own proper
  interest; for he that serueth for profit only, and meerly to make gain of his
  master, deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth neither cherishment nor fauour. A master stands in stead of
  God; now we <pb n="27" facs="tcp:22083:19"/> must not principally serue God for the good
  which he doth vnto vs, but as he is our God. The Scripture reporteth of
  <hi>Ioseph,</hi> That his Master hauing trusted him with the gouernment of his
  house, &amp; all his wealth, he did not deceiue him of a farthing. There are
  some seruants like your Iuy, which suckes out the sap, &amp; wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth the
  Tree whereunto it leanes, it selfe remaining fresh and greene. They are those
  Spunges which soake vp their Masters wealth, making their Masters poore, and
  themselues rich.</p>
               <p>The third, That a Seruant be solicitous, carefull, and
  painefull; for the slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, Nature abhorreth and condemneth: <hi>Vidisti
  hominem velocem? stabit coram Rege,</hi> (i.) <hi>Seest thou a man diligent in
  his businesse? hee shall stand before Kings.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Prou.</hi> 22. <hi>v. vlt.</hi>
                  </note> Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence is pretious
  in all men, but most in a Seruant; Who can indure a lazie Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, or a dull
  Beast? The Ball was antiently the Symbole of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, according to
  <hi>Cartaneus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cart. lib. de De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orum
 imagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus.</hi>
                  </note> The ball one while goes flying in the ayre ouer our
  heads, another, runnes as low as our feete, but neuer lies still, but is
  continually tossed too and fro. And <hi>Aristotle</hi> sayes, That a Seruant is
  <hi>Instrumentum viuum,</hi> A liuing Instrument: and as an Instrument hath not
  his owne will, but is directed by the hand of the Artificer; so a Seruant is
  not to bee at his owne will to doe what himselfe listeth, but as he is
  commanded and employed by his Master.</p>
               <p>If Masters and Seruants would keepe these rules, it would bee a
  happinesse for the Master to haue such a Seruant, and for the Seruant to haue
  such a Master. It hath antiently beene doubted, Why amongst men so equall by
  nature, God hath permitted so great inequalitie as there is betweene him that
  serueth, and him that commandeth? And the reason of this doubt is the more
  indeered, for that seruitude is a thing so distastful, &amp; held so great an
  ill, that many haue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred death before it. <hi>Theodoret</hi> answereth
  thereunto,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Theod. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de Prou.</hi>
                  </note>
  That Seruitude was the curse of Sinne, and that the first Seruant in the world
  was <hi>Cham,</hi> on whom his father threwt his seuere malediction, That he
  should be a Seruant to his brethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, <hi>Because he discouered the nakednesse
  of his father.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Aug. lib.</hi> 19. <hi>de Ciuit.
 cap.</hi> 15.</note> S. <hi>Austen</hi> saith in his Books <hi>De Ciuit.
  Dei,</hi> That this penaltie began from the malediction of <hi>Eue</hi>; and
  that those words, <hi>Thou shalt be vnder the power of thy Husband,</hi>
  implyed subiection and serui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> in an Epistle which
  he writes to <hi>Simpliciarius,</hi> saith, That Seruing is sometimes taken for
  a blessing: and hee prooues it out of that which <hi>Isaac</hi> did to his
  elder sonne <hi>Esau, He blessed him, that he might serue his brother</hi>;
  ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing out of a particular prouidence and loue made <hi>Esau</hi> seruant to
  his brother, to the end that his harshnesse might bee gouerned by his
  discretion. So that wee see, that although the fortune of a Seruant (speaking
  generally) is verie bad; first, because libertie is a great good: secondly,
  because to serue a Tyrant is a great euil; yet he that hath the good hap to
  serue a good Master, is verie happie; for such a Master serues in stead of a
  Father, a Councellor, a Tutor. And this was this seruants happinesse, to haue
  so good a Master as this Centurion, heere spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, who saith, <hi>Puer meus
  jacet, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>But here by the way it is to be noted, That there is a great
  difference betwixt one sinner and another: for he that is hardned in sinne, is
  made rather worse than better by correction. And this is that which

  receiued no correction. And in another place he compares them to reprobate
  siluer, which being put into the Crisol of affliction to be refined and
  purified, remaines fouler than before. Others there are that are tender
  hearted, and are as sensible of other mens miseries, as if them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues were in
  the same case; and iust so was it with this discreet Centurion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dignus est, vt illi praestes,</hi> (i.) <hi>He is worthie,
  for whom thou shouldst doe this.</hi> The Elders of the Iewes in Capernaum,
  which were sent by the Centurion vnto Christ, to beseech him to come and heale
  his seruant, acknowledged a power in our Sauior of working miracles, by that
  often experience they had made there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, but they did not acknowledge his
  Diuinitie. And therefore they here notifie vnto Christ the great merit and
  deseruingnesse of this Centurion; which if it had beene meerely for Gods sake,
  they might the better haue pleaded it. They alledge two reasons to induce him
  thereunto.</p>
               <p>The first, <hi>Diligit gentem nostram, He loueth our
  Nation;</hi> which hee hath many wayes manifested by those his good deeds and
  actions towards vs; and this his loue and kindnesse bindes vs to solicite his
  cause, which good will of his ought likewise to incline you to fauour this his

               <p>The second, <hi>Synagogam aedificauit nobis, He hath built vs a
  Synagogue;</hi> whereby hee hath not onely shewed his good affection to the
  Iewes, but his religious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse also vnto God; <hi>Dignus est ergo, vt illi

                  </note> for Loue obligeth much. Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith,
  That Nature did ingraue nothing so deepely in our hearts, as to loue him that

  heart that repayes not loue with loue: agreeing with that of <hi>Marcilius
  Ficinus,</hi> That Loue is <hi>Tanti pretij,</hi> a thing so vnualuable, that
  nothing can recompence it but Loue.</p>
               <p>First, From this ground we may gather the foulnesse of our
  dis-loue towards God: <hi>Ipse prior dilexit,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Iohn, He
  loued vs first,</hi> &amp; if he had not vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed <pb n="29" facs="tcp:22083:20"/> to
  loue vs, mans brest had neuer had a stocke whereon to graft his loue towards
  him. Hauing therefore lou'd vs first, and out of his loue done vs such great
  and speciall fauours, it were extraordinarie basenesse and impietie in vs, not
  to loue him againe, hee beeing so willing to accept of our loue. Many there are
  which stand vpon it, as a point of honour, not to bestow their loue vpon euerie
  one that seekes their loue, but onely vpon those that haue giuen them some
  pledges of their loue. Now if thou doost esteeme thy loue at that rate, that
  thou wilt not conferre it vpon him to whom thou doost not owe it, yet oughtest
  thou haue the honesty to repay thy loue to him to whom thou doost owe it;
  especially being Nature abhorreth, that they that loue should not be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued.
  Moreouer, many times thou louest those that neuer loued thee, nay, euen those
  that haue hated thee. Is it much then that thou shouldst loue him that hath
  loued thee, neuer will leaue off to loue thee, and cannot but loue, though thou
  shouldst grow cold? S. <hi>Bernard</hi> saith, That we are wonderfully
  beholding vnto Christ for the treasures of his loue, because thereby he gaue vs
  matter to worke vpon, to repay this incomparable good of Loue, with Loue. No
  other of Gods fauours towards vs can we make repayment of in the same coyne,
  onely his loue is left vnto vs to be repaid with loue.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The second reason is no lesse powerfull, <hi>He hath
  built vs a Synagogue.</hi> For where some seruice hath preceded, it is as it

  must first gather them, then tread them, then squiese them in the Presse, then
  poure them from one vessell into another, &amp;c. And therefore is it sayd, Thy
  milke is of more worth, than all the wine in the World; not onely for it's
  pleasantnesse and sweetnesse, but for it's readinesse at hand. <hi>Esay</hi>
  pointing at this readinesse in God, sayth, <hi>Ad vocem clamoris, statim
  respondebit tibi,</hi> i. <hi>Hee will answere out of hand the voice of thy

  thou shalt haue an answere. Whereas, to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of this World, thou shalt
  put vp a thousand memorials, and shalt haue so many more references, order vpon
  order, and yet no order taken for thee. But the Prince of Heauen, <hi>Statim
  respondebit tibi,</hi> i. <hi>Hee will answere out of hand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I will come and heale him.</hi> Hee might haue recommended
  this businesse to Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> or Saint <hi>Iohn</hi>: But that which
  a Prince can performe in his own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, hee ought not to remit the same to
  his Ministers, though they should bee as faithfull vnto him as <hi>Peter.</hi>
  For the seruant many times carries not that soule a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with him as his Master
  hath: and in case the seruant should blurre and soile his for his owne priuate
  gaine, this doth not excuse the Master. A Prince may well giue power <hi>in

  hee cannot, nor ought not. <hi>Quodcunque potest facere manus tua instanter

               <p n="2">2 It causeth no small admiration, that a King should call

  straight way answered, <hi>Ego ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niam &amp; curabo eum,</hi> i. <hi>I will
  come and heale him.</hi> Wee render two reasons of this doubt made vpon this

  poore than of the rich.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Psal.</hi> 72.14.</note>
                  <hi>Honorabile nomen eorum coram illo,</hi> i. <hi>Their name is pretious in
  his sight.</hi> And albeit this honour grew vp from the <pb n="31" facs="tcp:22083:21"/>
  beginning of the World: yet after that, God made himself poore for to make vs
  rich; pouertie is so exalted by him, and in that high esteeme, that men euer
  since haue lookt vpon it with other eyes than they did heretofore. Before that
  God came into the world and was made flesh, there was not that rich man which
  did not scorne and contemne the poore. <hi>Diues</hi> did lesse esteeme of
  <hi>Lazarus</hi> than of his dogges; But God making himselfe poore, and
  wrapping vp in ragges the treasure and richnesse of Heauen, the condition of
  the poore hath euer since beene better with God, than that of the rich; and
  therefore hee rather hasteth to relieue the Poore than the rich.</p>
               <p>And therefore the Physitions of the bodie are much
  condemned,<note place="margin">Phisitions taxed, that will not visit the
 poore.</note> who being the <hi>Appollo's</hi> and <hi>Aesculapij</hi> of their
  times, disdaine to visit the poore men. And so likewise are the Physitions for
  the soule, who boast themselues to be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors to great kings &amp; princes,
  the poore mans soule being no lesse pretious in Gods sight than those of the
  rich. Those Masters are also reproued,<note place="margin">Masters like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, who
 neglect their Seruants, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sicke.</note> who scorne to visit their poore
  seruant in his sickenes, alledging (forsooth) that the chamber or the bed is
  readie to turne their stomacke, and makes them sicke with the loathsomenesse of
  the sent, when they can well enough indure the stinke of a Stable, or the
  nastinesse of a dogge-kennell.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we are to consider, That Humilitie carries with it a
  kind of omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potencie, because it subdueth the Omnipotent. Of the Sunne of the
  Earth the Poets write, That wrestling with <hi>Hercules,</hi> still as he
  toucht the ground he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered fresh strength. The humble minded man, who
  esteemes himselfe to be but the sonne of the Earth, and the off-spring of Dust
  and Ashes, by bowing himselfe in all lowlinesse to this his mother, hee shall
  bee able to wrestle with God himselfe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, This readinesse of Christs towards the Centurion,
  should stirre vs vp to compassion, and to take pittie of our neighbour.

  himselfe, which he had instructed his Embassadours in, when they said vnto him,
  <hi>Domine, noli vexari,</hi> i. <hi>Lord trouble not thy selfe.</hi> Saint

               <p>
                  <hi>I am not worthie, &amp;c.</hi> Before he said, <hi>Noli
  vexari,</hi> and now he giues the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of it; telling our Sauiour, That his
  house is not worthie the entertaining of so great a Guest. Words of as great
  faith, as humilitie: Of great Faith, by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging this his diuine
  Maiestie, vnder this vaile of his humane nature; Of great Humilitie, by
  confessing himselfe vnworthie to receiue into his house so much Vertue and
  Holinesse.</p>
               <p>But here is to bee noted, That there is a twofold humilitie; one
  of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, another of the will: that of the vnderstanding, whereby
  a man is brought to the true knowledge of his own vnworthines; that of the wil,
  where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto wee readily yeeld of our owne accords. To expresse this a little
  more plainely, There are some men that are humble, who are humbled by their own
  will; othersome become humble, beeing humbled by their fortune. That the
  humbled should bee humble it is no great vertue; the greater wonder were, that
  he should grow proud vpon it. But that Honour and Greatnesse should wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
  humble it selfe, and of it's owne accord, <hi>Hoc regium est, This is an
  heroicall vertue,</hi> and beseeming Kings. What a glorie was it vnto King
  <hi>Dauid,</hi> that being so powerfull and so rich a Prince as he was, that he
  should be more meeke and humble than a child? <hi>Si non humiliter sentiebam,
  &amp;c.</hi> What a commendation in <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> so highly honoured
  both of Heauen and Earth, that hee should confesse himselfe vnworthie to vnlose
  the latchet of our Sauiors shooe? What shall we say of the Sonne of God, who
  being equall with his Father, willingly humbled himselfe to become his Seruant;
  teaching others this lesson, <hi>Learne of me, for I am meeke and humble of
  heart.</hi> What sayes the Preacher, <hi>The greater thou art, the lowlier be
  thy carriage.</hi> And for this is our Centurion heere com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, being so
  great a Commander as he was; <hi>For I also am a man vnder autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, and I
  say to one, Goe, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he commeth.</hi> Saint
  <hi>Austen</hi> saith of him, That by confessing himselfe vnworthie,<note place="margin">

 Ser.</hi> 6. <hi>de Verb. Dom.</hi>
                  </note> he made himselfe more worthie: for
  there is no disposition so fit for the receiuing of God, as that which
  acknowledgeth and confesseth it's owne vnworthinesse.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Amb. Ser.</hi> 89.</note> And Saint <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose</hi> beating
  vpon the same point, saith, That those houses which seemed too streight and too
  narrow to receiue our Sauiour Christ, were made large enough by confessing
  their vnworthinesse to receiue him. But here doth that place of Saint
  <hi>Paul</hi> offer it selfe, <hi>He that shall eat of this Bread, and drinke
  this Cup vnworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, shall bee guiltie of the Bodie and Bloud of
  Christ.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.</note> Now if hee that
  receiues Christ vnworthily shall be held guiltie of his bodie and bloud; Shall
  not hee much more be condemned, in confessing himselfe vnworthie to receiue
  him? I answer, That in the Communion there are two manner of dignities to be
  con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered; one of the person which receiueth Christ our Sauiour; the other of
  the disposition and preparation wherewith hee receiueth him. Touching the 
  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:22083:23"/> first dignitie, No man can receiue Christ worthily; for
  the holiest, bee hee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer so holy, is but a creature, and there is an
  infinite distance betwixt him and his Creator. But touching that other
  dignitie, of preparation and disposition, a man may receiue him worthily, by
  doing that which God commandeth vs to doe for the better receiuing of him. A
  Husbandman can hardly receiue his King worthily, in respect of his house, and
  his person, by reason of the great disequalitie between them; but in respect of
  his preparation, doing that which he is commanded to doe on his part, as to see
  the house bee cleane, and euerie thing in good order; so may he receiue him
  worthily.</p>

  loue to his Seruant, that hee was as sencible of this his sickenesse, and the
  danger he was in, as if the case had beene his owne: He did not desire any
  indecent thing of our Sauiour, nor lash out into passion, transported by his
  affection; but proceeded therein with great prudence and sobrietie, not onely
  hauing a care to that which was fitting for his seruant, but with what respect
  also, and reuerence, hee was to carrie himselfe towards our Sauiour Christ.</p>

                  <hi>Onely say
  the word, &amp;c.</hi> From hence <hi>Chrysostome</hi> proueth, That the
  Centurion did beleeue the Diuinitie of Christ: For if hee had thought him to
  bee but a Saint, and not a God, hee would haue said, I pray Sir speake a good
  word for me; but he vseth not that phrase of speech, but, That himselfe would
  command him to be whole. But it is to bee noted, That though all the antient
  Saints doe grant, That the Centurion beleeued that Christ was both God and man;
  yet <hi>Gregorie Nazianzen,</hi> Saint <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> and Saint
  <hi>Austen,</hi> doe note, That spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king absolutely of doing a miracle, with
  empire and command, is not <hi>prenda,</hi> that is, a token of God onely; for
  any man may doe the like, to whom God shal giue the power. If thou hadst (saith
  our Sauior) but so much faith as a graine of mustard seed, thou mightst command
  mountaines to remooue, and they shal obey thee: But to worke a miracle,
  commanding the same to be done by his own proper power &amp; vertue, that is a
  token of Gods power onely. And that the Centurion pretended this, it is
  prooued, first, by the great curtesie vsed by him, <hi>Lord, I am not worthie
  that thou shouldst come vnder my roofe</hi>; which was as maner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as any man
  could speake it. Secondly, because a Saint may verie well do mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, and by
  commandement too, but so, that hee must haue this power from God: but withall,
  it shall not be lawfull for any man to craue them in that kind; for the power
  of doing miracles is neuer so tied to the will of any Saint, that he may worke
  miracles where and when he will himselfe. Thirdly, the compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son vsed by the
  Centurion, prooueth the supreme power to reside in Christ our Sauiour.</p>

  (saith Saint <hi>Austen</hi>) <hi>nisi ipse qui mirabatur?</hi> i. <hi>Who had

  that this admiration is a commendation which our Sauiour gaue of the Cap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aines faith. For to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire a thing
  euen amongst prophane Authors, is an extraordinarie kind of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending it. For
  Christ had seene by a blessed and infused knowledge, that faith which was
  hidden in the heart of the Centurion; but because hee did manifest the same in
  his presence, admiring it, he commended it; and therefore it is said,
  <hi>Miratus est, He admired.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Austen</hi> on the other side distinguisheth
  Admiration from Commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Some things (saith he) are commended, but not
  admired; others are both commended and admired. Christ perceiuing this his
  faith, by admiring it did commend it; not for any interior admiration that was
  in himselfe; but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme and establish ours: For all the world might well
  wonder, to see so great faith in a Souldier. Suting with that which Saint

  not erre; yet it is said of him, That he encreased in knowledge, <hi>He went
  onwards in wisedome and in stature.</hi> So that his admiring of the Centurions
  faith, was not so much his knowing of any wonderful and singular thing, but an
  experimentall knowledge thereof; as that of the Astrologer, who knowes 
  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:22083:24"/> before hand that there shall bee such an eclipse; yet
  notwithstanding when it comes hee admires it. So that our Sauior hauing this
  experimental knowledge, the admiration could not be so great as otherwise it
  would haue beene, had hee not foreknowne it.</p>
               <p>But some man perhaps will say, I doe not see any such rare
  circumstances in the Faith and words of the Centurion, as should cause in vs
  any great admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for I doe not see him shed teares with <hi>Marie
  Magdalen,</hi> nor adore him with the knee, with <hi>Regulus,</hi> nor clamour
  him with importunitie, with the Cananite, &amp;c. I answer, Will yee expect
  this courtship from a souldier and a swordman? Let <hi>Ieremie</hi> and
  <hi>Daniel</hi> weepe; for a souldier, it sufficeth that he make a discreet,

                  <note place="margin">Faith how said to be great.</note>A mans
  Faith may bee said to bee great, or little; First in regard of beleeued truths,
  and so hee that beleeues the more truths, hath the more Faith. Secondly in
  respect of the difficultie: and so hee that beleeues things of a higher nature,
  and which exceede humane capacitie, ha's the greater Faith. Christ told his
  Disciples, That they were <hi>Modicae fidei, Men of little faith,</hi> because
  they thought he could better saue them waking,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi>

  our Sauiour could haue cured the maid while shee was yet aliue, but that he
  could not raise her vp being dead, said, <hi>Trouble not thy selfe, the maid is
  dead. Regulus</hi> had the like beleefe, <hi>Come downe before my sonne be
  dead.</hi> Thirdly, in consideration of the arguments and reasons for it: for
  Faith runnes a contrarie course to Knowledge: This is the greater and more
  perfect, the more it is strengthened by force of argument, and the more knowne
  de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations are made of it: That, the lesser &amp; weaker they are. And
  therfore Christ taxeth the Iewes, that they would not beleeue without miracles,
  <hi>Vnlesse yee see signes and wonders yee will not beleeue.</hi> Fourthly,
  because of it's firmenesse, and it's constancie; for that Faith which indureth
  most persecutions, temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and contradictions, is so much the greater. To
  the Cananitish woman our Sauiour said, <hi>O woman, great is thy Faith:</hi>
  for beeing beaten with so many put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by's, &amp; disgraces, like a rock she stood
  strongly to it, &amp; could not bee remoued. <pb n="37" facs="tcp:22083:24"/> But for those
  that beleeue at certaine times, but in time of temptation yeeld and giue off,
  of them our Sauiour saith, That they haue but small store of Faith.</p>
               <p>In euerie one of these kinds so great was the Centurions Faith,
  That our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour said of him, <hi>Non inueni tantam fidem, I haue not found so
  much Faith, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First of all, he did beleeue, That he could heale his Seruant,
  who now lay at the point of death. Not like the Father, who hauing his sonne
  possessed with a Deuill, spake doubtingly to our Sauiour Christ, <hi>Si quid
  potes, adjuva me,</hi>

  canst do any thing, helpe me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, he did beleeue, That he was able to cure him onely by
  his worde, or to speake better, by his Wil onely. Not like the
  Archisynagoguian, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired him, That he would lay his hand vpon his
  daughter.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, hee did beleeue, That hee could cure him though hee

  <hi>Regulus,</hi> who was earnest with him, to make all the hast he could vnto

  <hi>Domine, si fuisses hic frater meus non fuisset mortuus, Lord, if thou hadst
  beene here my brother had not died.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, he did beleeue, That our Sauior was God and Man.<note place="margin">

  to the Iewes.</p>
               <p>It was likewise great, in regard of those slender arguments and
  reasons to mooue him thereunto: For he had neither read the Scriptures, nor the
  Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies that were of him, nor did know Christ, but by the fame &amp; report
  that went of him, nor had seene many of his miracles, for Christ had not then
  done many. As it is noted by Saint <hi>Chrysostome.</hi>

  did <hi>Abraham,</hi> and as he did the woman of Canaan, when he said <hi>Ego
  veniam &amp; curabo eum, I will come and heale him.</hi> This was a great
  proofe of his Faith, but hee was as firme as the Rocke; so that in euerie one
  of these respects his Faith was great.</p>
               <p>If any man shall aske, How great (I pray) was this Faith of his?
  I answere, Greater than Christ found in the People of Israell, to whom he had
  preached, and for whose sake he had wrought so many miracles.
  <hi>Tertullian</hi> declareth this greatnesse of Faith in that manner, that the
  comparison cutteth not off the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarkes alreadie past, nor the Israelites to
  come; but extendeth it selfe onely to those that were present, whose Faith he
  had made triall of.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for that it ranne greater difficultie than that of his
  Apostles and Disciples; in regard of those lesse forcible arguments and reasons
  to leade him thereunto; as also in respect of that small paines that had beene
  taken with him: For Christ sought after his Apostles and Disciples, and tooke
  them from their Trades and occupations, manifesting his glorie vnto them.
  According to that of Saint <hi>Iohn, Manifestauit gloriam suam, &amp;
  crediderunt discipuli eius, He manifested his glorie, and his Disciples
  beleeued.</hi> But the Centurion was inuited onely by his Faith, to acknowledge
  Christ, and to beleeue truly in him.</p>
               <p>Lastly, his Faith was greater in it's proportion; As our Sauiour
  said, That the <pb n="38" facs="tcp:22083:25"/> mustard-plant was greater for it's
  proportion, than all the other trees of the field: so by the way of proportion
  was the Centurions faith, in regard that he was a souldier, an vnletter'd man,
  as also in respect of those few miracles which he had seene, in comparison of
  the Iewes.</p>

  did not alledge a false Text, but a true, though ill interpreted; but these

  doth not bewaile the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent. <hi>Deuteronomie</hi> complaineth, That the
  times were ill and peruerse, and the People foolish, and ill giuen. Saint
  <hi>Iohn,</hi> That wickednesse was grown to it's heigth, <hi>In maligno est

                  <hi>Plautus</hi> commending
  Wit, compares it to Wine, which the older it is, the better it is. Many Authors
  are not now reckoned of, which shall grow famous two hundred yeres hence: &amp;
  many Painters get not that commendation they deserue, &amp; only because they
  are modern. <hi>Michael Angelo</hi> hid an Image in certaine antient
  buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings; for he knew if it were presently discouered, they would haue
  praised it for an excellent old piece of times past, till they had seene his
  name, which he had set thereunto.</p>
               <p>This Doctrine is verie plaine, making the comparison from the
  time of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one of those Lawes, Naturall, Written, and that of Grace;
  wherein they were best in their beginnings. But if the comparison be generall
  for all times whatsoeuer; howbeit in the order naturall the former were the
  better, because all things grow old, and waxe worse and worse, as is to be
  seene in Plants, Beasts, &amp; Men: yet in the order supernaturall, those times
  are the better, which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calleth the latter: For although God
  did many great fauours in those former Ages, yet all of them put together did
  not come neere to the Incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and death of Christ, and those his blessed
  Sacraments. And therefore <hi>Esay</hi> said, <hi>Ne memineritis priorum, &amp;
  antiqua, ne intuamini,</hi> (i.) <hi>Doe not so much admire those things that
  were done in former times</hi>; for they are all as it were clouded and
  obscured by these that we now presently enioy. And this is prooued now at this
  day by the perfection of the Law; for antiquitie did admit the Law of a mans
  righting of himselfe, when he was wronged; of louing his friend, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
  his enemie: but this is now controlled and reformed.</p>

  Whence <hi>Lyra</hi> presumeth they drew that contrarie ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of hating

  left not any thing so deepely ingrauen in mans heart, as to loue him that
  loueth vs: And therefore a needlesse commandement to impose those things vpon
  vs, whereunto we haue a natural appetite. What need we will a man to loue
  himselfe, or a father to affect his children? And it being a naturall
  inclination in vs, to loue those that loue vs, why should this bee giuen

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, euery man naturally loues himselfe. <hi>Nemo vnquam

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, those things that are most pretious, and most rare,
  which haue most reasons for amabilitie, as Profit, Honour, Delight, and
  Honesty, it is not needfull that we should bee willed to loue them. And as
  <hi>Laertius</hi> relates it from <hi>Socrates,</hi> The World hath not any
  thing more pretious and more louely than a Friend. Besides, our Sauiour sayth,
  Where our Treasure is, there is our Heart. And our Friend beeing so rich and
  pretious a Treasure, hee must of force steale away our Heart from vs, and
  therefore superfluous is that speech, <hi>Diliges ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum tuum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, the essence of friendship consisteth in reciprocal

               <p>Heereunto I answere, That mans heart beeing left to it's owne
  naturall incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, it will doubtlesse render loue for loue. But since that
  the Deuill did roote out that good Seed and sowed Tares therein, wee see, that
  in the most naturall and strictest obligations, sometimes there growes
  dis-loue. As in bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther against brother, father against sonne, sonne against
  father, and in the wife against her husband, &amp;c. What thing more naturall,
  than to giue our heart vnto God, for those generall benefits of Creator,
  Redeemer, and Conseruer; and for many other particulars, which cannot bee
  summed vp? And yet the Deuill doth blot them out of our hearts, and sowes in
  stead thereof so many ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, as Heauen stands astonished therat. Though
  therfore it be a naturall thing to loue our friend, <hi>Nam &amp; Ethnici hoc
  faciunt,</hi> i. <hi>For euen the Heathens doe this,</hi> Yet the Deuill soweth
  a kind of hatred in our hearts, so abhorrible to nature, that feigned
  friendship, comes to bee doubled malice. And the world is so farre gone in this
  case, that it is now held as strange, as happy, that one friend should truely
  loue another. Hence is it, that the Scripture makes so many inuectiues against

  takest the ring of a fire-pan by that part which is cold, and fliest from that
  which is hot and will burne thy hands. In like sort thou must loue thy enemie,
  as hee is the image of God, and hate him as hee is a sinner. And in another
  place the same Doctor sayth, That God put it in the singular number, <hi>Odio
  habebis inimicum tuum,</hi> i. <hi>Thou shalt hate thy enemy</hi>; signifying
  thereby, that wee should hate the Deuill, but not our brother. And that wee
  erre in this our hate: for it is no wisedome in vs, to hate our enemy who doth
  vs so much good, but the Deuill who doth vs so much harme.</p>
               <p>First then, I say, That this Law is not of God; for God is
  Loue,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Iohn·</hi> 1.</note> as Saint
  <hi>Iohn</hi> sayth; and Loue cannot make a Law of dis-Loue.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is not pleasing vnto God; for the Scripture being
  so full of those good things, that hee did for his enemies, only to stirre vp
  mans heart, to diuine Loue; hee would not command vs to hate them. Saint
  <hi>Paul</hi> sayth,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.</note> That the bloud
  of Christ speakes better things, than that of <hi>Abell.</hi> For this cryeth
  for vengeance, that for pardon and forgiuenesse. The bloud of a dead man is
  wont to discouer the murderer, his wounds bleeding afresh; one while it
  naturally calleth for reuenge; another, it boyles and breakes forth into flames
  at the very presence of the murderer; another, while the vitall spirits which
  the murderer left in the wounds, returne to their naturall place, and with
  great force gush foorth afresh. But bee it as it may bee, I am sure the bloud
  of Christ speaketh better things than that of <hi>Abell</hi>; for this
  discouereth the murderer; and that, in the presence of those that crucified
  him, prayed vnto God to forgiue them, as not knowing what they did.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that it was contrary to Gods intention. In
  <hi>Exodus,</hi> hee commanded, that he that should meet with an Oxe of his
  enemies that was like to perish, or an Asse that was haltered &amp; intangled,
  he should helpe both the one, &amp; the other. Now hee that wills vs to be thus
  friendly to a beast, what would he wee should doe to the owner thereof?
  <hi>Nunquid Deo est cura de bobus, Hath God care of Oxen?</hi> In

  notorious ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. In the <hi>Prou.</hi> it is said, <hi>When thy enemy
  falleth, reioyce not at his ouerthrow</hi>: For God may exchange fortunes, and
  his teares may come to thy eyes, and thy ioy to his heart. And <hi>Eccl.</hi>
  tels vs, <hi>Hee that seeketh vengeance shall find vengeance.</hi>

               <p>Fourthly, it is against the law of Nature: I aske thee, if thine
  enemie should bee appointed to bee thy iudge, thou hauing offended the Law,
  wouldest thou not hold it an vnreasonable thing? and wilt thou then bee iudge
  of thine owne wrongs? God is onely a competent judge <hi>In causis

               <p>Lastly, This being no Law of God, neither as he is the Author of
  Grace, nor as the Author of Nature, it must needs bee of the Deuill, as
  <hi>Origen</hi> inferreth. For he seeing that God had engrauen in mans heart
  the law of loue, standing (out of his pride) in competition with God, he
  engraued dis-loue, and left it so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed in the hearts of many, that albeit
  for these many Ages, God hath ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mered both Angells and Saints vpon this
  Anuile, he could neuer bring them to softnesse.</p>
               <p>The occasion that might mooue those antient Doctors to this Law,
  was, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for that God had commanded <hi>Saul,</hi> that he should destroy
  <hi>Amalec</hi>; or the vengeance that he tooke of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his
  People; or that of <hi>Leuiticus, Pursue your enemies, and they shall fall
  before you</hi>: as if to enter into a iust warre, by order from God, might
  allow a man to doe the like to his brother out of his owne will and pleasure:
  Or, for that it is commanded in <hi>Leuiticus, Thou shalt loue thy friend as
  thy selfe</hi>: Or, as <hi>Nicholaus de Lyra</hi> hath notedit, That they draw
  this consequence from <hi>Aristotle,</hi>

                  <hi>Si amicis bene faciendum est; consequens est,

               <p>
                  <hi>Thou shalt hate thy enemie.</hi> Whence it is to be noted,
  That that Law which gaue them licence to hate their enemie, does not giue them
  leaue to kill him: though the Deuill many times likes better of a mortall
  hatred, and a desire of reuenge, than the death of a man. For Hatred is that
  Loadstone which drawes other sinnes along with it; but the killing of a man
  doth vsually bring repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with it, for the many disasters that attend it.
  <hi>Iudas</hi> till he had dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen his bargaine for the betraying of his
  Master, had deliuered vp his heart to the Deuill; but that was no sooner
  performed, but hee repented himselfe of <pb n="45" facs="tcp:22083:28"/> what he had done.
  Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> calls hatred <hi>Homicidium voluntarium.</hi> Some
  seeme to sinne meerely out of nature, (for custome is another nature) and these
  that thus sinne, sinne without a will or desire of sinning; but he that hates,
  must of force sinne with all his heart.</p>

  <hi>Ego.</hi> The immensiue greatnesse of the sea is to bee seene in this, that

  God loueth all alike, and maketh as much of one as another. <hi>Philon</hi>

  himselfe is as deere vnto God, as all mankind put together: And he prooueth it
  by this, That he faith vnto euerie one, I am thy God; being the God of all.</p>
               <p>The second, That earthly fathers loue themselues better than

  be condemned to be stoned to death. <hi>Item,</hi> in that precept, Thou shalt
  not sweare; a lawfull oath is not prohibited, for composing of differences

               <p>Fifthly, Vmpires, to whom for their honesties and authorities

  become light, when they are counterpoysed by greater; so that heauinesse which
  Nature suffereth in lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing her enemie, is made light and easie by the
  counterpoyse of Grace.</p>
               <p>First, we are to confesse, That this performance is not to bee
  measured by any naturall force or power of ours; for it were great pride to
  presume, That man could naturally deserue so great a reward as is prepared for

  That God hath not his fauour so readie at hand, thou doost wrong God, who is
  alwaies so readie at hand, that thou canst blame no bodiebut thy selfe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is so easie and so sweete, by those fauours that
  God affoordeth, <pb n="50" facs="tcp:22083:31"/> that a man may verie well say, <hi>Iugum
  meum suaue est, &amp; onus meum leue, My yoke is pleasing, and my burthen

  <hi>miseri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordia tua adiuuabat, When I said my foot is moued, thy mercie

  them? No, Thou art pittyfull, franke, and libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall; for what thou commandest,
  thou accompaniest with a thousand sweete blessings.</p>
               <p>On the other side againe, wee doubt, how the old Law, beeing so
  heauie a burthen, and our Sauiour Christ adding thereunto a new load vpon the
  necke of that load, it may be said <hi>Iugum meum suaue est</hi>? I answer,
  That there are two kinds of easing of a burden, either by lessening the weight,
  or by adding greater strength: For a poore weake beast, foure <hi>Arroba's</hi>
  [a certaine measure in Spaine, of some sixe ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

  <hi>Arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba's</hi> will bee but a light weight: And that to the poore beast the
  burthen may seeme the lighter, the better way is to make him fat, &amp; to put

  eight and thirtie yeres benummed, our Sauiour sayd, <hi>Tolle grauatum tuum,
  Take vp thy bed</hi>; a sickenesse of so long continuance could not but be a

                  <hi>Pray for them that persecute you.</hi> This Prayer may be

               <p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:22083:32"/>The one, That the hurt is so great to him
  that doth the wrong, that he that is wronged ought to take pittie and
  compassion of him: and beeing it is <hi>Damnum animae, The hurt of the
  soule,</hi> which the offended cannot repaire of himselfe, hee must pray vnto
  God for him, That he would be pleased to repaire it. <hi>Philon</hi> trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
  of the death of <hi>Abel</hi> saith, that <hi>Cain</hi> killed himself,
  <hi>&amp; non alterum,</hi> &amp; not ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and that <hi>Abel</hi> was not
  dead, but aliue, because he kild but the bodie, which was none of his, and left
  him his soule, which was his. And of <hi>Caine,</hi> That his bodie remained
  aliue, which was none of his, and his soule slaine, which was his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
  therefore <hi>Clamat sanguis Abel, The bloud of Abel cries, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The other, That there are some such desperate enemies, that are
  made rather worse than better by benefits; being like therein vnto Paper, which
  the more you supple it with Oyle, the stiffer it growes; or like vnto sand,
  which the more it is wet, the harder it waxeth; or like vnto an anuile, which
  is not stirred with the stroke of the hammer; or like vnto <hi>Iudas,</hi> who
  comming from the washing of our Sauiors feet, went forth afterwards with a
  greater desire for to sel and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray him: whereas being in this desperate
  case, hee should rather haue had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course vnto God. Prayer therefore is
  proposed vnto vs, as the greatest charme and powerfullest exorcisme against the
  obstinacie &amp; rebellion of an enemie. For vpon such occasions as these,
  Prayer is woont to worke miracles. Saint <hi>Stephen</hi> prayd for those that
  stoned him to death; which wrought so powerfull an effect, that Saint
  <hi>Austen</hi> saith, That the Church is beholding in some sort, to this his
  Prayer, for the conuersion of Saint <hi>Paul.</hi> And Saint <hi>Luke,</hi>
  That the Heauens were opened hereupon vnto him, &amp; he saw Christ standing in
  glorie at the right hand of his Father. And it is worth the noting, That the
  ordinarie Language of the Scripture is, That our Sauiour Christ is said to sit
  at the right hand of God the Father: but now here in this place the word
  <hi>Stantem,</hi> Standing, is vsed, as if Christ had stood vp of purpose to
  see so rare and strange an accident, and claue the Heauens in sunder, offering
  him all the good they did containe; or that he did seeme to offer him his Seate
  (as it were) as to a child of God; <hi>vt sitis filij patris vestri, That yee
  may be the children of your Father.</hi> And this grace and fauor which God
  shewes vnto those that pray for their enemies, was peraduenture a motiue to our
  Sauiour Christ, to make that pittifull moane vpon the Crosse, bewayling the
  Iewes cruell p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oceeding against
  him,<note place="margin">The example of our sauiour to moue vs vnto it.</note>
  and praying that his death might not be layd to their charge; <hi>Pater ignosce
  illis, Father forgiue them.</hi> Hee might haue hoped, that these his
  charitable prayers would haue opened the Gates of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, for the Sonne of
  Glorie to enter in: But in stead thereof the Sunne was darkened, and a blacke
  mantle (as it were, in mourning) spred ouer all the earth, whilest he himselfe
  vttered these words of discomfort, <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken
  me?</hi> The doores of Heauen are shut against me, &amp; my God hath forsaken
  me. But the mysterie is, That Heauen was shut against him, that it might be
  opened vnto you; and euen then was it opened to the Theefe, and to many that
  returned from Mount Caluarie, <hi>percutientes pectora sua,</hi> i. <hi>Smiting
  their brests</hi>; as also to that Centurion that said, <hi>Verè filius
  Dei erat iste, This was truly the Sonne of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There may be rendred another reason of this our Sauiours praying
  vpon the Crosse: Which is this, That for to obtaine fauors from Gods hand,
  there is no meanes comparable to that of praying for our enemies. <hi>In me

  that they went from Tauerne to Tauern, and from one house to another, singing
  Songs in dirision of him, descanting and playing vpon him; but I, turning
  towards God, prayed heartily for them, as knowing there was not any time fitter
  than that, for the obtaining of my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, <hi>Tempus beneplaciti, An

  actions with iniuries: <hi>Ego autem orabam</hi>; But I quitted their wrongs

  things: The one, how vnpleasing a Petition it would be in Gods eares, and how
  harsh it would sound, that we call vnto him for vengeance vpon our enemie;
  desiring, that <hi>Ioabs</hi> dart may strike him through the heart. The other
  is Saint <hi>Austens,</hi> who saith, That he that of God shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat euill
  against euill, does himselfe that which is euill: and it comes by this meanes
  to be a double euill; two euills (I say) spring from thence, The one, that he
  does ill; the other, That he prayes ill. So that when hee that is wronged shall
  pray vnto God to destroy this ill man; God may verie well make him this
  an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, Which of the two doost thou meane? for in seeking to kill another,
  thou first killest thy selfe: <hi>Quando dicis, Deus, occide malum;

  of his Enemy; here, hee did God as acceptable a piece of seruice, for that it
  was the rarer of the two. And this was it, that made God say of him; <hi>Inueni

  birth was God: As by Angels, Sheapheards, Kings, &amp; Prophesies: But tothis,
  his pouertie, his suffering cold, his shedding of teares, the thatch of the
  house, the cobwebs in the roome where he lay, &amp; the hay in the cratch, left
  him more perplexed than before. Afterwards he was more amased, when he saw him

  acknowledge him to be the sonne of God. And this did confound him more than all
  that went before. But when hee saw, hee pardoned so many iniuries that were

               <p>Lastly, Being the Sonne of God, thou mayst be sure hee will be
  mindfull of thee, take care of thee, and loue thee. <hi>Esay</hi> brings in the

               <p>
                  <hi>Be yee therefore perfect, euen as your Father is
  perfect.</hi> He reduceth this perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the loue of our enemie; for to a
  mans friend, the verie Heathens do this. Saint <hi>Austen</hi> and Saint
  <hi>Chrysostome</hi> say, it is <hi>Omnis virtutis Corona &amp; vertex, The
  heigth and glorie of all vertue.</hi> Where he denieth not the reward to him
  that shal loue his friend for Gods sake; but to him that shal loue like a
  Gentile, or a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican, not for Gods loue, but either out of a naturall
  propension in himselfe, or for his owne pleasure, or commoditie and profit; and
  he that doth not loue his enemie, shewes plainly, that he loueth not his friend
  for his loue to God, but for his loue to himselfe: for if he should loue him
  for Gods loue, hee would no lesse loue his enemie, being that he is as wel the
  Image of God, as his friend. So that he that loues his friend, and not his
  enemie, ought not to expect a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for louing of his friend: but he that
  doth not onely loue his friend, but his enemie also, hee shall be sure of a
  double reward, <hi>Introduxit me Rex in cellam vinariam, ordinauit in me

                  <hi>and
  his banner ouer me, was Loue. Origen</hi> notes, That that which the Soule
  desires of her Husband, is not to loue, or to hate; for this being a naturall
  perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, it is not possible it should faile: the will is neither idle, nor
  in vaine, for it must of force wish either well or ill.<note place="margin">Our
 loue how it is to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed.</note> All the kindnesse that shee
  desires of her husband, is, his ordering of his loue; for in disorder
  intollerable errours arise. Of all the Predicaments, God is the highest, and
  hee ought to bee the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall marke of our well ordered affection:
  <hi>Dilexi, quoniam audiuit Deus vocem orationis meae,</hi> (i.) <hi>I loued,
  because the Lord heard the voyce of my prayer</hi>: Loued? Whom hast thou
  loued? A prudent wil, which placeth it's felicitie in the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance of the
  Law; wee must not aske of it, Whom it loueth? This is a question to be asked of
  a Reprobate, or Cast-away. In a word, He that man ought chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to loue, is
  God; and next, man, for the loue of God, be he friend, or be he foe. And
  because when it doth not reach &amp; extend it self to our enemie, it cannot be
  said to be perfect loue; it is said, <hi>Estote perfecti sicut Pater vester, Be
  ye perfect as your Father.</hi> The reason is, Because in the rest of the
  actions of vertue, humane re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects may come athwart vs; one may fast, because
  abstinence importeth his health; another giue Almes, because he affecteth
  vaine-glorie; a third, not seeke to be reuenged, for feare of those
  inconueniences that follow after it; a fourth be chast, for the auoyding of
  shame, &amp;c. But to loue a mans enemie, that must onely proceed from our loue
  to God, it must needs be done only for Gods sake, and God onely can requite
  it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:22083:34"/>Secondly, he reduceth this perfection to the
  loue of our enemie, because it is a sure pledge for Heauen. When <hi>Elias</hi>
  and <hi>Baals</hi> Priests were both of them to offer Sacrifice in triall of
  the true God, it was conditioned, That that God that should send downe fire
  from Heauen vpon the Alter, should bee held to bee the true God. <hi>Baals</hi>
  Priests ball'd vpon him, but all would not doe: but <hi>Elias,</hi> when he had
  set vp his Alter with the wood vpon it, the beasts about it, and had poured
  water thereupon, to the filling vp of the Trench, he had no sooner pour'd forrh
  his Prayer, but such great store of fire descended from Heauen, that it burnt
  the flesh, the wood, the stones, and likewise wasted and consumed the water.
  That it should burne the beasts, the wood, and the stones, it was no such
  wonder; but that it should take hold on it's contrarie, which is water, it was
  a manifest signe, that it was the fire of Heauen. That your loue should cleaue
  to your owne flesh &amp; bloud, it is not much;<note place="margin">The
 perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our loue how to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered.</note> that it should take hold
  of the wood and stone, that likewise is no great wonder; but that it should
  worke on it's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, on one that desires to make an end of thee, &amp; to
  consume thee, this is loue indeed, this is charitie, this is the fire of
  Heauen.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The loue to our enemie doth more discouer the
  perfection of our loue; because it is without any hope of temporall reward.
  <hi>Elisaeus</hi> filled the widdows emptie cruses with Oyle; and thou must
  replenish with thy loue and good workes, those emptie brests that haue nothing
  in them to deserue it. For where there is some deseruingnesse, and reason of
  merit, the Gentile &amp; the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican doe the like.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, It argueth more perfection; for that the loue of our
  enemie is that glosse which sets before our eyes our owne faults and offences.
  When <hi>Shimei</hi> reproched <hi>Dauid</hi> to his face, and gaue him such
  opprobrious language, that his Captaines and Commanders that were then about
  him were impatient of it, and would haue killed him; <hi>Dauid</hi> withstood
  it, and would not suffer them to take away his life; and the reason was,
  because it put him in mind of his own sinnes; and he that lookes well vpon his
  owne, takes no great notice of another mans. And this made him to say,
  <hi>Peccatum meum contra me est semper,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Our Enemies are
 but Gods Instruments, who by them doth punish vs for our sins.</note> 
                  <hi>My
  sinne warres more against me than mine enemie.</hi> Againe, though thy enemie
  doe persecute thee without a cause, it is not without cause, that thou doost
  thus suffer; for (as <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> hath it) <hi>Nullus iniustè
  patitur, No man suffers wrongfully</hi>: So that thou must not looke so much
  vpon him that iniures thee, as vpon thine owne sinnes, for the which God
  permits them to iniure thee. It is <hi>Ieremies; Who euer said, Let it bee
  done, though the Lord command it not? Let vs search our owne wayes</hi>: Take
  but thy life into examination, and thou wilt find, that thy sinnes deserue a
  thousand times more. <hi>Dauid</hi> would by no means consent, that his People
  should reuenge those disgracefull words which <hi>Shimei</hi> spake vnto him;
  and What was the reason? Onely for that he was Gods Instrument. S.
  <hi>Austen,</hi> vpon the 31 <hi>Psalme,</hi> pondering those words of <hi>Iob,
  Dominus dedit, Dominus abstulit, The Lord hath giuen, and the Lord hath
  taken;</hi> noteth, That he did not say, <hi>Dominus dedit, Diabolus abstulit,
  The Lord gaue, and the Deuill tooke away</hi>: For those whips and scourges
  which God sendeth, though they be inflicted vpon vs by the hands of the Deuill,
  yet are we to account them to come from God.</p>
               <p>Out of the whole drift of this Chapter, I will inferre one
  cleere and manifest consequence, which is this, If to hate our enemie be so
  much condemned both of Heauen and Earth, those excesses and exorbitances which
  fall out vpon this occasion (be it in respect of the time and place, or of the
  person, or the act it self, or our deepe disaffection) they are all of them
  here condemned.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:22083:35"/>Two kind of faults God doth extreamely hate
  and abhorre:</p>
               <p>The one, Of those who haue no measure or moderation in their
  reuenge; saying with the Idumaeans, <hi>Exinanite, exinanite vsque ad
  fundamentum in ea, Raze, raze them to the verie foundation</hi>: They would not
  haue one stone left vpon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Hierusalem; wishing that they might say,
  <hi>Etiam periere ruinae, The verie ruines are also perished.</hi> Wherby it
  seemeth, that mans cruelty would stand in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition with Gods clemencie. And
  that as God is not willing that any man should set a taxe and size vpon his
  mercie; so these men will haue no man to put a rate vpon their reuenge. Saint
  <hi>Peter</hi> asked our Sauiour Christ, How many times hee should forgiue his
  brother? Will seuen serue? (saith he.) Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour answered, I say not seuen
  times, but seuentie times seuen times. Whence <hi>Tertullian</hi> hath noted,
  That hee had an eye therein to mans excesse in reuenge. <hi>Lamech</hi> slew
  <hi>Caine</hi> and the yong man that waited vpon him; and the women go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
  about to be reuenged of him for the death of the young man, hee sayd vnto them,
  Hearken ô yee wiues of <hi>Lamech,</hi> Let it not once enter into your
  thoughts to take reuenge on my life: for though the vengeance which God
  appointed for the killing of <hi>Caine</hi> had a limitation; yet the reuenge
  of my death shall be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taxe, and without measure; <hi>Setuplum vltio
  dabitur de Cain, de Lamech autem sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuagies septies, Cain shall be reuenged
  seuen times, but Lamech seuentie times seuen times.</hi> Wherein he sets downe
  a finite number for an infinite. In a word, <hi>Lamech</hi> in this word
  <hi>Septuagies septies,</hi> shewes, That the reuenge that should bee taken
  thereof should be without terme, without limitation; wherein he seemes to make
  mans crueltie to contest with Gods mercie.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Hatred should not bee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall.</note>The
  other is, Of those that hate their enemies so to the death, that though they
  themselues die, yet they will not let their hatred die with them, but leaue it
  in their last Will and Testament to their heires, to take reuenge of their
  wrongs, and to prosecute their enemies vnto death: Being herein like vnto
  <hi>Dido,</hi> who throwing out her curses and maledictions on <hi>Aeneas,</hi>
  and desiring the Tygres and other wild beasts to reuenge her wrong, breathed
  her last with this inuocation,<note place="margin">They that liue in hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of
 hart are iustly suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to dye in it.</note> 
                  <hi>Hoc precor, hanc vocem
  extrema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cum sanguine fundo,</hi> i. <hi>This is my prayer, I wish no other
  good, and this I poure forth with my latest bloud.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whence I would haue you to note, That this hardnesse of mans
  heart at his death, is in punishment of his hardnesse of heart in his life.
  <hi>Hac anima aduersione</hi> (saith Saint <hi>Austen</hi>) <hi>punitur
  peccator,</hi> i. <hi>This is a sinners punishment.</hi> And in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place,
  <hi>Cor durum male habebit in nouissimo, It shall goe ill with a hard heart in
  the latter day.</hi> And <hi>Ieremie</hi> treating of those that persecuted
  him, <hi>Reddes eis Domine vicem iusti, &amp; dabis eis scutum cordis, Thou
  shalt pay them in their owne coyne, thou shalt vse them as they vsed their
  enemies; thou shalt giue them a heart like a shield of Brasse, it shall be hard
  in their life time, and hard at their death.</hi> No prayers could mollifie
  them, nor shall their entreatie mooue thee: for only the merciful shall only
  find mercie.</p>
               <p>Now for the reforming of both these excesses, Saint
  <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Sol non occidat super iracundiam vestram,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Let not the Sunne goe downe before
  your wrath goe out,</hi> Let not the one set before the other be setled. Saint
  <hi>Chrysostome</hi> renders two reasons of this saying, <hi>Sol non occidat,
  &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The one, That the Sunne doth fauour and serue you with his
  light, and with his influences, cherishing your health and your life, and does
  not return home at night brawling and complayning, that he hath bestowed this
  his loue &amp; seruice vpon an vngrateful &amp; vnthankful person. There is no
  creature but wil grumble &amp; repine to serue such a one; <hi>Ingemescit, It
  sighes and groanes, &amp;c.</hi> (saith Saint <hi>Paul</hi>) but 
  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:22083:35"/> the Sunne does not grudge at his seruing of you.</p>
               <p>The second, That the night is of it selfe sad, melancholly, and
  in a disposition to troublesome thoughts and immaginations. Now then, that your
  fantasie may not present you with an armie of fearefull cogitations, and the
  dismall represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of reuenge, before that the night comes on, quiet that
  raging sea within thy brest, by throwing Oyle vpon it; become soft &amp; gentle
  by clensing thy heart of all rancour and malice. If the beames of the Sunne
  cannot pierce through a thicke cloud, they will hardly make their way through
  the pitchie darkenesse of the night, being that they are naturally then in
  their augmentation. When the cheerefulnesse of the day, employment in
  businesses, and the companie and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of our friends cannot remooue the
  clouds of our anger, the night will hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly scatter them, who is the mother of
  painefull thoughts. For, as the infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the bodie encrease by the
  absence of the Sunne; so in like sort doe the diseases of the soule. I know not
  whither <hi>Ioshuah</hi> were toucht or no with this Spirit, when hee willed
  the Sunne to stand still, when he was in the pursuit of his enemies.</p>
               <p>It seemeth vnto some, That it is a verie hard matter, and more
  than flesh and bloud can beare, to pardon fresh iniuries, the bloud boyling
  then in our brest: But this is answer'd by that example of our Sauior Christ,
  who when his wounds did poure forth bloud on euerie side, yet his tongue cryde
  out, <hi>Ignosce illis, quia nesciunt quid faciunt, Forgiue them, for they know
  not what they doe.</hi> Where I would haue you to note, that the word
  <hi>faciunt</hi> is of the present Tense. When they were boring his feet with
  nailes, Saint <hi>Austen</hi> to this purpose saith, <hi>Is petebat
  veniam,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

               <p>The replies of the Flesh are infinite, and without number. Some

 enemies, and their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation.</note> Whilest wee liue in the world we must
  follow the fashions of the world, and liue accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to it's Lawes: and that
  if a man put vp one iniurie, he shall haue a thousand put vpon him. I answer
  hereunto, That it is a fouler fault to seeke out reasons to defend and
  maintaine sinne, than to commit it. And if thou shalt tell mee, thou desirest
  to be reuenged because thou art weake, and canst not bridle thy anger; I shall
  the rather pittie thee, and shall withall councell and aduise thee to aske
  par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of God, for this thy weakenesse and infirmitie. But that thou shouldst
  de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend thy offence with reasons and force of argument, it is not a thing to
  bee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magined: but more against reason it is, to reason against God. Let vs
  now leaue the Gospell and the sacred Scriptures, and let vs bring this
  businesse within the spheare of reason: I say then, That it is the Language of
  him that knowes not what reason is, as if it were possible there could be any
  reason against God. The Clowne rests so well contented with his poore Cottage,
  that he wil not change it for the Kings Pallace: And the worldly man likes so
  well of the lawes and fashions of the world, that he sticks not to preferre
  them before those of God.</p>
               <p>Others stand vpon their honour, alledging, How can a man liue in

  Thou art a base fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low if thou put vp a wrong, and doe not reuenge it to the

  to pardon an iniurie. The World will say, Thou hast no worth in thee, and that
  thou doost degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from thy noble Ancestors. But therein the world likewise
  lies; for there is nothing more noble, than to forgiue and forget a wrong.</p>
               <p>Others wil say, I forgiue my enemie with all my heart, but I
  will neuer speake to him. I answer, This is a metaphisicall case, that thou
  wilt giue him thy heart, and denie him thy tongue. Me-thinkes that Fountaine
  that is faire within, should not be foule without: Shall God giue thee a heart
  to wish well, and wilt not thou find a tongue to speake wel? And words too,
  without a heart, are not worth God-a-mercie: <hi>Si salutaueritis fratres
  vestros tantùm, If yee shal onely salute your brethren,</hi> it is
  neither any great thing, nor yet thankes-worthie; but to say thou wilt giue him

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">To be first in forgiuing is the greatest

  offer my selfe vnto him, but let him come to me, if hee will, else I will neuer
  bee friends with him. I answer, That by thy yeelding first vnto him, thou wilt
  winne by the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hand, and get thy selfe the more credit. <hi>Abraham</hi>
  (thou knowest) gaue <hi>Lot</hi> leaue to chuse first, and being his Kinseman

  be no strife betwixt thee and me, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Others say, Mee-thinkes it is a hard case, that God should wish
  mee to loue and doe well vnto him that loues not me, and would reioyce in any
  il that should happen vnto me. I answer, That I am not bound to desire of God,
  that he would fulfill the desires of my enemie: for if he direct them to my
  hurt, and to my ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine, I am not bound to aske of God any ill to my selfe. When
  a Bell is drawne vp to the top of some Tower, or a Stone to some high Steeple,
  it is the naturall and common course of those that see it carried vp, to desire
  no mischance may befall it: But if any should be so maliciously foolish, as to
  say in his heart, O that I might now see it fall: the Stone might verie well
  replie, Let not thy desires prosper. The like may he say, who goes mounting vp

               <p>Last of all, To him that shall thinke that this is too hard a

one night in the middest of the sea; the winds being stiffe and terrible, the

shrewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beaten, and hardly able to withstand the swelling of this proud sea,
this storme continuing in it's strength and vigour till the fourth watch in the
morning. And though these were many and verie forcible reasons to make them to
be affraid; yet vnto these was added a new cause of feare, to wit, That our
Sauiour appearing vnto them wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vpon the waters, they thought it was a
Phantasma, some Spirit in a seeming assumed shape, whither Angell, or Deuill,
they could not deuise with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. And the common receiued opinion is,
That the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e Visions had their
seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall apparitions, as it appeareth in Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> and the <hi>Acts
of the Apostles.</hi> They pittifully cried out, for feare of beeing drowned in
the Deepe, not considering, that he who had filled their bellies in the
wildernesse, could trample the waues vnder his feet, and preserue their bodies
from sinking. Our Sauiour made shew at the first, of walking a farre off from
them, as he did afterwards with those that he went along with to Emaus; but in
the end he spake vnto them, and made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe knowne vnto them. Then
<hi>Peter</hi> thereupon rushed presently into the Sea, and beginning to sinke,
he stretched out his hand vnto him, and reprehended him for hauing so little
Faith. At last they entred into the ship, and they were no sooner come in, but
the winds went away, the sea grew calme, and the tempest <pb n="62" facs="tcp:22083:37"/>
ceased. The Mariners, and the rest that were aboord this Barke, acknowledged
our Sauiour to be the Sonne of God. They disembarked in Genezareth, the fame of
whose comming was soon spred abroad; they brought forth their sicke vnto him,
and our Sauiour Christ restored them to their health.</p>

  late, &amp;c.</head>
               <p>Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> saith, That the Feast being ended, our
  Sauior went vp to the Mount to pray, <hi>Ascendit solus orare, He went vp
  alone.</hi> Saint <hi>Marke,</hi> and Saint <hi>Mathew,</hi> That he forced his
  Disciples to go on shippe-boord. Nor doth this admit any contradiction; for
  before that he withdrew himselfe to pray, he might verie wel will them to make
  them readie to goe to sea: And happely they might stay wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for him till it
  were towards the euening, and seeing he did not come, yet (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as he had
  commanded them) embarked themselues.</p>
               <p>Of this his forcing them to goe aboord, the Doctors giue diuers
  reasons.</p>
               <p>The first is taken out of Saint <hi>Iohn.</hi> Our Sauiour knew
  that the People had a purpose to make him King; which danger hee seeking to
  auoyd, hee withdrew himselfe aside to pray, beeing all alone; notifying to his
  Disciples, That they should in the meane while prouide to goe to sea.</p>
               <p>The second, That our Sauior thereby might take occasion to work
  this won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull miracle: for if the Disciples had not embarked themselues,
  neither had our Sauiour walked vpon the sea, nor <hi>Peter</hi> aduentured
  himselfe vpon the waues, nor his Disciples endured such a terrible storme, nor
  had there been such cleere notice taken of his soueraignepower.</p>
               <p>The third is Saint <hi>Chrysostomes</hi>; who saith, That when
  they were to go to sea, our Sauiour would that they should carrie along with
  them the remainder of such broken pieces of bread, and of the fishes that were
  left, to the end that they might thinke vpon the forepassed miracle. Wherein
  they were so dull sighted, that Saint <hi>Marke</hi> saith, <hi>Non enim
  intellexerunt de panibus, They vnderstood nothing about the Loaues.</hi> And
  therefore those whom Fullnesse and Prosperitie had thus blinded, God through
  troubles and afflictions cleereth their eye-sight.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The Society of Women, though de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout, is
 dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous.</note>The fourth is <hi>Theophilacts</hi>; insinuating this for an
  especiall reason, That our Sauiour Christ seeing his Disciples in conuersation
  with some deuout women which were present at the Feast, hee willed them
  presently to embarke; concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, that they would bee farre more safe in the
  sea amidst the waues, than in the companie of women, though neuer so deuout,
  neuer so holy. And the ground of this truth may be gathered from the Disciples
  vnwillingnesse to put forth to sea: but our Sauiour like a good Horseman, that
  claps his spurres close to the sides of his Ginnet, when he refuses to make his
  carreere, <hi>Coegit illos, He compelled them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fifth, For that the Shippe is a Type and figure of
  gouernment, of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and of dignitie: And God will haue his friends to bee
  forced to ascend to those high places. And therefore it is said, <hi>Coegit
  illos vt ascenderent, He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled them to ascend.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The last is Saint <hi>Hieromes</hi>; who alledgeth, That the
  content beeing so great which the Disciples tooke in the presence of their
  Master, it was a cleere case, that it would verie much grieue them to depart
  from him, and to bee forced to forgoe his companie. For he that hath once a
  truetast of God, will hardly bee withdrawne from him. A Dogge, be he beaten
  neuer so much, he will not leaue his Masters house, and all for the loue that
  he beareth him, and the pleasure and delight that hee taketh in his presence.
  And this was it that made <hi>Iob,</hi> when hee <pb n="63" facs="tcp:22083:37"/> was most
  beaten with his afflictions, to vtter with a great deale of patience this
  humble language, <hi>Etiam, si occiderit, in illum sperabo,</hi> i. <hi>Though
  hee kill mee, yet will I trust in him.</hi> What shall they then doe, that haue
  sate at the same boord with their God, and eate of his meate? Shall not they
  the fuller they are fed, be still the more hungrie? yes doubtlesse. For as
  <hi>Ecclesiasticus</hi> sayth; <hi>Qui edunt me,</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>And the Ship was in the midst of the Sea.</hi> It seemeth
  somewhat strange, that our Sauiour Christ, inforcing his Disciples to enter
  into the Sea, and they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing punctually obey'd his command, that hee should
  punish them with such a dangerous and fearefull tempest. That Gods justice
  shoul ouertake <hi>Ionas</hi> in the ship, that the Mariners should bee as it
  were the Sergeants, the Whale the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, the Sea the executioner, it was not
  much, for that hee sought to flie from Gods obeydience, and showed himselfe
  vnwilling to performe the seruice that was inioyned him: But that the
  Disciples, who left the Land, entred into the Sea, and consecrated their
  desires to their Sauiours Will; that these men should see themselues in danger
  of drowning and ready to perish, is more than much. And this difficultie is
  indeered the more, because it is sayd, That no ill shall happen vnto him, who
  shall keepe his commandements.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eccl.</hi> 1.</note>
                  <hi>Qui custodit prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptum, non experietur quidquam mali.</hi> But ô
  Lord, if thou afflictest with tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, those that loue and obey thee; What
  wilt thou doe vnto those that are renegates, and blasphemers, &amp;c? This
  doubt requireth those reasons, which our Sauiour had for the miraculous
  allaying of this tempest.</p>
               <p>The first is Saint <hi>Chrysostomes,</hi> The Disciples (sayth
  hee) might haue dwelt vpon that former miracle of the loaues of bread, and the
  fishes, and on that ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and saturitie wherewith such a multitude of
  guests were satisfied and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, carrying great store thereof away with
  them in their bosomes, and their pockets. They might likewise haue argued from
  thence, the Omnipotency and Diuinitie of our Sauiour Christ, <hi>Et non
  intellexerunt de panibus</hi>: But they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained blind: God therefore doth so
  order the businesse, That those eyes, whome Good could not open, Ill should:
  And that the daunger of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest should aduise those, whome feasting and
  fulnesse of bread could not persuade.</p>
               <p>The second, Let no man looke in Gods house to eate of his bread
  for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. God perhaps will bid thee sit downe and eat, and say vnto thee,
  <hi>In die bonorum fruere bonis,</hi> i. <hi>In the day of wrath, be of good
  comfort:</hi> But withall,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eccl.</hi> 7.16.</note> thou
  must looke to pay thy shot, For God will presently make triall in the furnace
  of tribulation, whether his bread bee well bestowed or no. There is no Saint in
  Heauen which hath not beene put to this proofe. And Ecclesiasticall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of
  all other, haue a preciser obligation lying vpon them, who are the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of
  Gods house, who eat more especially at his Table, who gather vp the remainders
  of the feast, inioying the fruits of the earth in great aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, and in
  more plentifull measure than other men. And it is no great maruaile that they
  that possesse much, should be possessed with much feare.</p>
               <p>The third, It is the ordinarie language of the Saints of God, to
  call this world a Sea, and this our life a sailing therein. This
  <hi>Origen</hi> prooueth, and <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larius,</hi> and <hi>Clemens
  Alexandrinus:</hi> and the proportions are many. Saint <hi>Austen</hi> ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
  two, the one, That as the water of the Sea is generally bitter, and it is a
  wonder if euer it become fresh and sweete: So our life is so full of gall and 
  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:22083:38"/> worme-wood, that there is scarce to bee found in it any
  the least smack of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent or sweetnesse: Suting well with that other saying
  of this sacred Doctor, That the greatest ioy which we inioy in this life, is
  not ioy, but a kind of light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and easing of sorrow. The other (which is
  likewise noted by Saint <hi>Basil,</hi> and <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi>) That

               <p>From hence followeth another proportion or conueniencie, which
  is a verie cleare one. For as the way of the Sea is full of dangers, of Pyrats,
  of Shelfes, and of Rockes; and as it is not possible, that mans wisdome and
  experience can preuaile against them; euen so is it with the world. The way by
  Land is of lesse difficultie: Euery man knowes how to make his necessary

  some of these should faile vs, wee may furnish our selues afresh at the first

               </p>
               <p>For his owne sake; For should it haue no enemies to persecute
  it, &amp; hotly to assaile her, Gods omnipotencie would not shew it's glorious
  splendor to the world. The force of fire is seene when the water cannot quench
  it; of light, when darkenesse cannot obscure it; of sweete odours, when the
  filthiest sents cannot ouercome their fragrancie; of power, when the whole
  strength of the world, nay the Deuill and Hell it selfe cannot preuaile against
  it. And this suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth vnto God in the persecution of his Church: for the
  enemies thereof haue been maimed and put to flight, Gods Arme remaining still
  strong &amp; sound. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> came brauely on with his Chariots and
  Horsemen; boasting as hee went, <hi>Persequor, &amp; comprehendam illos,
  euaginabo gladium meum, interficiet eos manus mea, I will pursue them, and
  ouertake them, I will vnsheath my Sword, and my hand shall slay them:</hi> But
  God beckned vpon the waues, and they swallowed vp aliue both him and all his
  Host. And the Text saith, That the Hebrewes saw the powerfull hand of God
  charging vpon them, hauing planted there in that sea the ensigne of his power.
  <hi>Tertullian</hi> saith of <hi>Iob,</hi> That God made him a triumphant
  Chariot of the spoyles of Hell, and that he dragged thereat along in the durt,
  his enemies en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes, to the greater dishonour of the Deuill. The like doth
  God doe in the Church, with Iewes, Moores, and Heretickes, himselfe remaining
  still firme against all their furious violences, like a rock in the midst of
  the sea. Some rocks are to be seene euen where the Seas are deepest; which it
  seemeth God placed there of purpose,<note place="margin">The Church why likened
 to a Rocke.</note> in scorne and contempt of that ouerswelling pride and
  furious raging of the sea: For though they haue beene lashed and beaten by them
  from the beginning of the world to this present day, they could neuer mooue,
  much lesse remooue them, because they haue sure rooting in the bottome of the
  Sea. And this is a Type of the Church, which God hath placed in the middest of
  this Sea of the World, for to make a mocke of as many as are her enemies.</p>
               <p>But some one will say, How can the Church be called a Rocke,
  beeing figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red here by this little Ship, which the waues thus tosse vp and
  down in the aire? I answer, That <hi>Ezechiel</hi> in his twentie seuenth
  Chapter, speaketh of Tyrus in the metaphor of an Isle, <hi>My beautie is
  perfect, and my abode is in the midst of the Sea.</hi> And presently changing
  that metaphor, he termes it a Galley; which is all one, as if he should haue
  said, That with Gods helpe a Galley may be an Isle, and without God an Isle may
  be a Galley. So likewise the Church, albeit it be a Ship in the middest of the
  tempestuous waues of the Sea, yet by the assistance of his holy Spirit it may
  bee a perdurable Rocke. And (as Saint <hi>Austen</hi> hath noted it) the
  Executioners haue often wanted strength and inuentions to torment, but there
  neuer wanted courage in the Martyrs for to suffer, by the diuine power and
  fauour of God. Howsoeuer therefore the waues shall beate against this Barke,
  they may want force to ouerturne her, but she will neuer want sides to make
  re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance.</p>
               <p>For the Churches sake; because it makes for her good,<note place="margin">The
 greatest persecution of the Church, is to want perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</note> and for her
  greater encrease. This is expressed in that Parable, <hi>Nisi granum frumenti,
  Except a grain of Corne, &amp;c.</hi> And in that other, <hi>Ego sum vitis
  vera, &amp; vos palmites, I am the true Vine, yee are the Branches.</hi> The
  happinesse of Corne consisteth in this, in that it is sowen, and in that it
  dies; That of the Vine, in that it is pruned, and hath it's <pb n="66" facs="tcp:22083:39"/> boughes and branches cut off: Many wilde Trees of vnsauorie Fruits,
  by the art of graffing are reduced to a pleasant relish. Of Saffron
  <hi>Pliny</hi> saith, That the more it is trodden on, the better it springeth:
  The graine of Mustard, the more it is bruised and broken, the greater strength
  it discouereth: And the Church, the more it is persecuted, the more it
  prospereth. And as Mariners are woont to say, that at sea the worst storme is a
  calme; so wee may say of the Church, that it's greatest persecution is to haue
  no persecution at all. <hi>Esay</hi> sets it downe for a threatning, That God
  will leaue off to prune and dresse his Vine any more, <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittam

                  <hi>&amp; non putabitur,

  ten: And the Church, by one Martyr being cut off, giues a plentifull encrease
  of two hundred conuerted Christians. Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> Saint <hi>Basil,</hi>
  and Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> prosecute this Doctrine more at large, in the
  vnfol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the aforesaid Parables.</p>
               <p>Lastly, for their sakes that looke thereupon, and behold at full
  the persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Church. For as to the righteous, the prosperitie of
  the sinner is a stumbling blocke of offence; <hi>Hic labor est ante me:</hi> So
  to the sinner, the perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the just causeth great scandall. Both these
  are vndoubted truths, both hard to bee vnderstood, but harder farre to bee
  persuaded. But God afflicteth with persecutions the thing which he most loueth,
  which is his Church; and prospereth those her enemies, which hate her, to the
  end, that men might there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by learne and vnderstand, that neither those euils
  which the Church suffereth, are true euils; nor those blessings which the other
  inioy, true blessings. And this is prooued out of Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> in
  his Booke <hi>De Ciuit. Dei</hi>;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Aug. lib.</hi> 1.

 5.</note> and out of <hi>Seneca</hi> in that his Booke, <hi>Quare bonis
  viris.</hi> So that the wicked, though that hee inioy a great deale of
  prosperitie, wee are not to esteeme it as a blessing; nor for that the
  righteous suffer much aduersity, are we to account it a curse vnto them: But
  ought rather to apprehend, that persecution is for their good, in regard that
  our Sauiour Christ giues it vs as a reward for our great seruice. <hi>Et omnis
  qui re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquerit patrem, matrem, &amp;c. centuplum accipiet cum
  persecutionibus,</hi> i. <hi>And euerie one that shall haue left father or
  mother &amp;c. Shall receiue a hundreth fold, with Persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> Saint
  <hi>Marke,</hi> and Saint <hi>Cyprian,</hi> both affirme, that persecution
  putteth vs in a kind of possession of that glorie which wee hope for hereafter,
  at least it giues vs an assurance thereof. And this is made good by this
  comparison. The Good, the Scripture stileth by the name of Wheat; and the
  Wicked are tearmed Chaffe. Now, it is the Fanne of persecution, that doth seuer
  the Wheat from the Chaffe.</p>

  as was <hi>Iob,</hi> to see whither he would sticke surely to his tackling. For
  Patience is a more assured testimonie of our triall, than Fasting, Prayer,
  Almes, or the like: for these are often subiect vnto falsehood. Againe, from
  this Triall, ariseth Hope; for hee that is wonderfull patient, cannot but haue
  a wonderfull good Hope. This was it that made God say to <hi>Abraham, Nunc
  cognoui quod timeas Deum, Now I know that <pb n="69" facs="tcp:22083:40"/> thou fearest

  that is, that he did euen then still hope, when all reason of hope did faile
  him. Besides, God is woont to permit that our tribulation should be great, to
  the end that our Patience might be made great, our Triall great, and our Hope
  great: and then doth he come in and helpe vs, when hee hath made sufficient
  proofe of our faith: to the trial wherof God puts vs a thousand manner of ways.
  The Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Israel passed through the bed of Iordan, those waters sliding
  gently along towards the dead sea, and those other drouen backe, so that they
  passed through it as through the drie land. And yet this might perhaps seeme
  vnto God but a slender triall of their Faith; First, Because a great number
  ioyning in companie together, they take more courage vnto them in the
  vndergoing of any danger; for common calamities are euermore the lesse felt.
  Secondly, In regard of the Arkes being there, whereof those waters might seeme
  to be affraid, and so flie backe for feare, <hi>Iordanis conuersus est
  retrorsum.</hi> Thirdly, For that there were so many innocent little children
  amongst them, whom God (they might suppose) would not suffer to bee drowned,
  considering they had not yet offended him, as not knowing good from euill. And
  therefore he commanded that twelue of them, vpon whom the lots should fall,
  should goe backe &amp; take out twelue great stones out of the bed of Iordan,
  to make a Pyramis or Alter to remaine as a memoriall of that miracle: whereunto
  they all of them readily offered themselues with a great deale of alacritie;
  and this was a great triall of their Faith: But it would haue beene greater, if
  God had commanded them to set their backes and shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders against the waues,
  keeping them there, and deferring his succour till the thread of their hope
  were broken in twaine, and they readie to perish.</p>

  Deuill.</note>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His famous Combat betwixt two of the stoutest and valiantest
Captaines that euer tryde their valour in a single Duel, wil very well deserue
the looking on, and require our diligent attention, taking vp as well our eyes
as our eares. This battell then that is here described by the Euangelist, is
the notablest and the stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest that euer was in former, or euer shall bee
seene in future Ages. The Combattants are two great Princes, whose power all
the world ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth, and whose wisedome admits no comparison; the one, the
Prince <pb n="71" facs="tcp:22083:41"/> of Light; the other, the Prince of Darkenesse: The
field wherein they fought, was a Wildernesse, where they had nothing to
sustaine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues withall but stones: Their Weapons, Wit, and Words; the
facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Vnderstanding, and the vse of the Tongue. The Deuills end
was, to repaire a double losse, or two-fold ouerthrow at our Sauiour Christs
hands: The one, That he could neuer catch him in any the least fault, nor find
him tripping in any one action that euer he did. And this was it that did mad
him to the heart, and mightily incense his rage, that amongst all mankind,
there neuer yet beeing any, though neuer so famous, neuer so iust, that had
escaped his clutches with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out receiuing some foyle or other; as <hi>Adam, Noah,
Abraham, Dauid,</hi> &amp; the like good and holy men: that now a man, in the
eye of the World of no better than a meane and ordinarie ranke, (for such a one
was our Sauiour held to bee) should escape his fingers, and should shew
himselfe to bee the onely Phoenix of the world. The other, that he did not yet
perfectly know by that euidence of his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, &amp; by those great
suspitions which he might haue of his diuine es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, by calling to mind those
menaces that were threatned against him in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, <hi>I will put enmitie
betwixt the woman and thee, betwixt thy seed and her seed; hee shall bruise thy
head, &amp;c.</hi> And he began to thinke with himselfe, What wil become of me
if this be the Bug-beare foretold by the Prophets? Questionlesse if this be the
man, I shall hardly escape a broken pate.</p>
            <p>Our Sauiours end was not any desire of his owne proper worth and
merit, nor any vaine-glorie to shew his valour; for it could bee no great
glorie to boast of,<note n="(1.)" place="margin">Our Sauiors main end in fighting
  with the Deuil, was to sanctifie our temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> nor no such
wonderfull conquest, that the Sonne and Heire apparent of Heauen should subdue
the Deuil. But his end was thereby to sanctifie our temptations, as he had done
all the rest of our miseries, by taking them vpon himself, because they should
recouer a new beeing, and a new honour: And that those temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which
heretofore did serue as steepe Rockes to throw vs downe into Hell, should serue
as Ladders to bring vs to Heauen. <hi>Theodores</hi> saith, That as Physiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
make Treacle out of Serpents<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so our Sauiour Christ drew an Antidote and
wholsome Medicine from the Deuil and his deceits and subtleties: so that now,
Temptation hath lost his name and strength, and of Gally-slaues we are made
Freemen by Iesus Christ.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Our Sauiour Christ did pretend by this fight,<note n="(2.)" place="margin"> 
                  <p>To free the world from feare.</p> 
                  <p>A description of the Deuill.</p>
               </note> to rid the world of
that great feare wherin it liued. Wherby we may suppose the feareful power of
the Deuill throughout the face of the whole earth. <hi>Iob</hi> in his 41.
Chap. maketh a dreadfull description of the Deuill, in the metaphor of a Whale,
or (as some would haue it) of a Sea Dragon; a Fish of that exceeding
greatnesse, that when he discouers himselfe in the waters, he seemeth to be
some little Island, or some pretie big Hill; <hi>Corpus eius, scuta
fusilia</hi>; his bodie is couered ouer with such strong scales, as if they
were barres of Brasse, and ribbes of Steele, and so close lockt &amp; ioynted
together, that the subtillest aire cannot get in between the knit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the
ioynts; <hi>Stornutatio eius, splendor ignis,</hi> The breath of his nostrills
is like vnto lightning; his eyes as flashes of fire; from his mouth come forth
flames, as out of a Furnace; from his nose issueth a thicke smoake; his breath
kindleth coles, and sets them on fire; there are no weapons either offensiue or
defensiue, that can withstand his force; <hi>Reputa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Pikeman, his Lance; all which hee so little cares for, that hee makes but a
jeast of it. In a <pb n="72" facs="tcp:22083:42"/> word, when he comes to make an end of
this large description which he makes of the Deuill, he concludes that chapter
with this Epiphonema, <hi>Non est potest<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

with him.</hi> Saint <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie</hi> vpon the fourth Chapter of <hi>Iob</hi>
noteth, That the Scripture giues the Deuil three kind of names or attributes;
<hi>Behemoth,</hi> or Elephant; <hi>Leuiathan,</hi> which some will haue to bee
the Whale; and <hi>Auis Rapinae,</hi> a Bird of Rapine, that liues onely vpon
prey; <hi>Nunquid illudes ei, quasi aui?</hi> In which three names hee did
comprehend the power of all the Beasts of the field, of all the Fishes of the
sea, and of all the Birds of the aire. The power of these three sorts of
creatures extends it selfe to these three elements, the Water, the Earth, and
the Aire: and they beeing all deposited in the Deuill, whose habitation is the
Fire, hee comes to haue dominion ouer all the elements. In other places of the
Scripture hee is called a Dragon, a Leopard, a Beare, a Lyon: but these
comparisons come short of the other. And therefore some Doctours expounding
this word <hi>Behemoth,</hi> say, That it signifies <hi>Multitudinem
Bestiarum,</hi> a multitude of Beasts; because it includeth in it the force and
poyson of all other sorts of Beasts whatsoeuer. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calls him a
Prince of power, the Ruler and Gouernor of this world: For as the state and
power of a Prince is farre beyond that of his Subiects and Vassals; so is the
Deuil in al other things <hi>Aduersus Principes &amp; Potestates, &amp; Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di
rectores, Against the Princes and Powers, and Gouernors of the earth.</hi> The
Greeke word is <hi>Cosmocratoras,</hi> a word of that fulnesse, that diuers
Fathers haue diuersly interpreted it: <hi>Tertullian, The possessions of the
world; Hilarie</hi> and Saint <hi>Hierome, The Mightie of the world, The Lords
of the world. Esay</hi> calls him a Barre or a Bol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, because the strength of a Prison consists in good
Barres and Bolts, and strong Lockes: <hi>Visitauit Dominus super serpentem
vectem, The Lord will visit that creeping Barre. Theodocion</hi> translates it
<hi>Robustum, The strong Barre: Simmachus, Vectem con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludentem, siue
claudentem, The enclosing Barre, or the Barre that shutteth vp</hi>; For he
doth shut vp many in his prison, and keepes them in miserable seruitude. Saint
<hi>Iohn</hi> in his <hi>Apocalyps</hi> bewaileth the Earth and the Sea,
because the Deuill comes forth enraged fiercely against them; shewing great
sorrow, that God had giuen them such small meanes to be reuenged of him, beeing
a Beast so powerfull, so cruell, so tyrannous, and so bent against them, that
man was turned coward, and become fearefull. But since our Sauior Christ
ouercame him, &amp; hath bound him fast in fetters and chaines of yron, he bids
vs be of good courage, and that we should stand no more in feare of him;
<hi>Feare not</hi> (saith our Sauiour) <hi>I haue ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many of Gods People when they entred first into the sea shewed
themselues fearefull &amp; cowardly; but after that the powerfull hand of God
had ouerwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the Egyptians, &amp; had thrown them vp dead on the other side
of the sea, the weakest women among them, and those men that were most faint
hearted, with songs of joy, and with Timbrels, did set forth the glorie of this
victorie, and did make a mocke of the power of <hi>Pharaoh; They praised the
hand of the Vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sher, who opened the mouthes of the dumbe, and made the
tongues of Infants eloquent.</hi> So likewise did the world liue cow'd before,
by the power of Satan; but after that the powerfull hand of Christ our Sauiour,
left in the Wildernesse the print of that wound which he had giuen him on the
head, the meanest and most coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Christian may now make a jest both of him
and Hell. One of the Sages of Greece said, That better was an Armie of Sheepe
that had a Lyon to their cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, than an Armie of Lyons that had a Sheepe to
their Commander. And therefore albeit wee are but weake and sillie Sheepe, yet
haue we a Lyon to our <pb n="73" facs="tcp:22083:42"/> Captaine, who hath ouercome our

for that God should bring downe their enemies, and put them vnder their feet.
This valiant Captaine did also subdue <hi>Zeba</hi> and <hi>Salmana,</hi> and

enioying of peace) and as by his death he did conquer our death; so likewise
(saith Saint <hi>Gregorie</hi>) it was fit, that the conquering of his
temptation should be the subduing of ours. The Prophet treating how cowardly
the Deuill would remaine after this victorie, saith, <hi>Thou hast made him
food for the People of Aethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opia.</hi> The Negro's of Zapa and Mandinga haue
piece-meale deuoured him, and eaten him vp, as it were by morcells. For the

The Romans would neuer consent that any Negro should bee listed for a souldier.
The vnknowne Authour vnderstandeth by the Aethyopians, those Crowes, which of
all other Fowles that feed vpon flesh, are the most fearefull: which is to bee
seene in this, that delighting so much as they doe, to picke out the eyes of
other creatures, they dare not aduenture to plucke them out vntill they be
dead. Of a coward the Spanish Prouerbe saith, <hi>A Moro muerto gran
Lançada, Giue a dead Moore a great blow with a Lance:</hi> Which is
spoken by way of reproch of notorious cowards, when they will offer to run a
man through when hee is dead alreadie. In Rome there was great opposition
betwixt two famous Orators, <hi>Tully</hi> and <hi>Metellus</hi>; the one was
stout and full of courage, and the other cowardly and timerous: Now when
<hi>Metellus</hi> Master dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he set ouer his Tombe-stone a Crow; Whereat
<hi>Tully</hi> jeasting, said, That hee now had paid his Master at his death,
for that which hee had taught him in his life. And therefore the Prophet
saying, That the Deuill should be the food of the Negro's, or of Crowes; was to
signifie thereby, that he was not able to put feare into the fearefullest and
most cowardly persons.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Our Sauiour Christ did pretend in this action of his, to
giue vs a great testimonie of his loue. All his actions proclaime loue;<note n="(3)" place="margin">To exemplifie his own loue.</note> but this of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
tempted, hath one circumstance of loue, that I know not well what can bee more:
For hauing giuen vs both Heauen and earth, and all that therein is, and which
is more, his onely begotten Sonne, with whom hee gaue vs all that good which we
could wish or haue; <hi>Quomodo cum illo omnia non nobis donauit?</hi> yet did
he alwayes reserue his honour vnto himselfe; <hi>I am the Lord, and I will not
giue my <pb n="74" facs="tcp:22083:43"/> glorie to another.</hi> And as <hi>Pharaoh</hi>
conferred on <hi>Ioseph</hi> all his authority and power, but not his Crowne
and Scepter, <hi>In this thing onely I will be before thee:</hi> So God being
most liberall vnto vs, in bestowing all his riches and graces vpon vs; yet was
he euer couetous of his honour. But by yeelding that the Deuill should tempt
him, it seemeth that he did put it in hazard, at least to it's triall: For, to
be tempted, is to be incited and prouoked to sinne, whose malice and
wickednesse hath that opposition and emnitie with God, which if our Sauiour (as
it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible) should haue consented vnto, hee should haue lost the name
of the eternall Son of God, and haue caused him to become his enemie for
euer.</p>
            <p>Besides, there is no stroke that strikes so home to a Noble brest,
as to bee ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by his enemie. <hi>Saul,</hi> that he might not die by the
hands of a Philistine, spake to his Sword-bearer to kill him: And his
Sword-bearer not daring to kill him, he killed himselfe. <hi>Cato
Vticensis</hi> did the like, that he might not become a Slaue to
<hi>Caesar,</hi> as <hi>Plutarch</hi> reporteth it. The like did
<hi>Cleopatra,</hi> beeing but a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. What presumption then is it, that a
Creature which had beene cast out of Heauen, for a base, in famous, and
disloyall Traitor, should pretend to conquer the Sonne of Heauen?</p>
            <p>Againe, To the Iust (saith Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi>) there is
but one Good, and one Euill necessarie: The Good, is God; the Euill, the
offending of God. <hi>Iob</hi> did not shew so much sorrow for the losse of his
children, his houses, his flocks, and his substance, as he did when his wife
said vnto him, <hi>Curse God and die</hi>; but that was as a dagger to his
heart. Shall I be angrie and offended with my God? No, though he should kill
mee, yet will I loue him: For I haue no other Good but my God, he is all my
hope, and all my comfort. What then might our Sauiour thinke of the Deuil? How
much should it grieue him to heare him say, <hi>Fal down and worship
me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, He was willing to be tempted, for that temptation beeing a
thing that we must all of vs necessarily endure,<note n="(4.)" place="margin">That we may haue an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</note> no, none of the
best of vs all can auoyd, we may know how to behaue our selues therein, by
following the example of this our noble Captain; <hi>Vt cuius munimur auxilio,
erudiamur exemplo,</hi> as Pope <hi>Leo</hi> hath it. <hi>Vt mediator esset,
non solum per auditorium, verum etiam per exemplum,</hi> as Saint
<hi>Austen</hi> hath it. Our life is a dayly warrefare, and a continuall
temptation, (not only profitable, but necessarie:) &amp; to those worldlings
that liue (to their seeming) in peace, Wisedome saith, <hi>Not knowing Warre,
they call so many euils, Peace:</hi> These are they that suffer a more bloudie
and desperate warre than any other. <hi>Iob</hi> saith, <hi>Mans life is but a
Warrefare vpon earth.</hi> Saint <hi>Gregorie</hi> calls it the Gard of our
ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues; <hi>For then are we inwardly best preserued, when outwardly wee are
by Gods dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion tollerably tempted.</hi> And amongst many other reasons
which are brought for the proofe hereof, there is one verie powerful; to wit,
That we shal haue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the especiall fauour and protection of our good God;
so that hee giuing vs strength to endure, we may account it a great happinesse
vnto vs.</p>

carried away the key with him. <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit eum Dominus de foris.</hi> The

                  </gap>o aquarum multarum, ad eum non

creuise belonging thereunto. Saint <hi>Bernard,</hi> expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding those words of
the ninetie one Psalme (<hi>Dicet Domino, susceptor meus es tu, &amp; refugium
meum, Deus meus, sperabo in eum.,</hi> i. <hi>I will say vnto the Lord, Thou
art my &amp;c.</hi>) asketh the question, Why God, being the God of all,
<hi>Dauid</hi> in that place cals him twice his God? I answere, That he is the
God of all, in regard of his Creation and Redemption, and other his generall
benefits towards man;<note place="margin">God in a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular maner the God of
  the faithfull.</note> but in Temptation, hee is the God of euery indiuiduall
person, as if hee did not busie himselfe, nor thinke vpon any other thing, than
the fauouring of the Iust, and the assisting of him vpon those occasions. Saint
<hi>Gregory,</hi> declaring those wordes of Christ, <hi>Not a haire of your
head shall perish,</hi> sayth, That a haire doth not paine vs when it is cut
away from vs, but the cutting of the flesh doth: If that then shall be kept
from perishing, by Gods protection and prouidence ouer vs, which doth not paine
vs; how much more will he take heed, that that shall not perish, which may put
vs to paine?</p>
            <p>Last of all, There is not any thing so notorious, and so
approoued, as the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall good that is gotten by Temptation. From thence grow
those braue Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, those valiant Souldiers, and those couragious Captaines,
which wage warre against the Deuill and Hell, keeping him out at the staffes
end, and putting him to the worst. As on the contrary, from Idlenesse come
Cowards, whiteliuerd Souldiers, Faint-hearted, Soule-lesse, and Lazie people.
As long as there were any frontyre-townes in Spaine, for the enemies to make
their inrodes, it had many braue and famous Souldiers, as the <hi>Cides,</hi>
and the <hi>Bernardos.</hi> But now there are none but Carpet-Knights, all men
of bombast,<note place="margin">Why God in his prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce ordained a continuall

delicacie, their Armour is turned into gay clothes; and their stiffe Launces,
into starcht bottle bands and beards. They all did then smell of Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poulder,
but now stincke of Amber, Siuet, and other Indian Gummes. <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi>
askes the question, Why the prouidence of God did ordaine this continuall warre
betweene the Deuils and Men? And the answere is, That thereby, the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of
Gods Souldiers might bee knowne. Saint <hi>Ambros</hi> sayth, That the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
workes his owne destruction by his dayly tempting of Men, for by seeking to
weaken their Bodies, hee strengthneth their Soules. And that <hi>Iob,</hi> when
hee sate vpon the dung-hil with his pot-sheard in his hand to scrape off his
scabbes, made all Hell affraid, and to stand amased at his patience.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Hee was led by the Spirit into the Desart, that hee might
  bee tempted.</hi> The holy Ghost was a guide to all our Sauiours Actions: Hee
  was <hi>Dux &amp; Comes</hi> (as Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> saith) or as
  <hi>Esay</hi> hath it, <hi>Spiritus sanctus, ductor eius fuit,</hi> i. <hi>The

  any mention that the holy Ghost leadeth vs vnto, but onely to Temptation. And
  this is expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with wordes that carry a kind of force with them, though
  voluntary and sweet. <hi>Expulit, agebatur, ductus est, Hee drew him not, hee
  was chased, hee was led.</hi> And the mysterie thereof is, that no man ought to
  presume, considering his weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, so much vpon his owne securitie and

  him vp as it were by the haire of the <pb n="76" facs="tcp:22083:44"/> head, and set him
  into it. And the truth of this doctrine is deliuered vnto vs by <hi>Victor

                  <note place="margin">Temporall victories got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
 Sprituall by flying.</note> Saint <hi>Iohn, Chrisostome, Gregorius Nissenus,
  Euthimius,</hi> &amp; many other Saints of God. In corporall warre, it is
  greater courage to fight, than to flie; but in the spirituall warfare, the
  assurance of the Victorie consists in flying. And God would rather haue vs to
  bee cowards through feare, than couragious through presumption; and therefore
  hee first promiseth vs his Protection, that is, his Ayd, and his Fauour.
  <hi>Deus refugium &amp; virtus, adiutor in opportunitatibus, &amp; in
  tribulatione,</hi> i. <hi>God is a helper in due season, &amp; in

  helper. Flye therefore from danger, and haue recourse vnto God, and beeing
  sheltred vnder the shadow of his wings, and vpheld by the strength of his Arme,
  thou needst not feare any harme that Hell can doe vnto thee. So that God is not
  bound to fauour thee in those temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations which thou doost thrust thy selfe
  into, but in those that thou seekest to shun. Saint <hi>Austen,</hi> aduising I

  as they did; they excused themselues vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, telling him, that they onely
  did so, that they might meete with some Temptations wherewith to encounter. But
  this glorious Doctor plainely told them; Herein, you seeke nothing but dangers,
  and stumbling blockes to cause you to fall. And as it is fit to take from
  before the eyes of the franticke, all those images and pictures which may moue
  passion in him, for that they wil be an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to make him madder than euer

  fled farre from it. And hee that shall flie from the occasions of sinning,
  performes no small matter. But hee that shall flie a farre off from them, will
  find it to bee most for his ease. Temptation, as it is the Deuils acte, is ill;
  and God doth not will it positiuely, but permissiuely hee doth; so sayth Saint
  <hi>Chrisostome</hi>: Aduising vs, that wee should not seeke after them, but if
  they chance to set vpon vs, then are wee to stand to it, and valiantly to fight
  it out. This our Sauiour Christ would insinuate to his Disciples, in the
  garden, when hee sayd vnto them; <hi>Watch and pray that yee enter not into

                  <note place="margin">

  sleepe, when hee is in daunger, and not to flie vnto God for succour, is to
  seeke after Temptation. Saint <hi>Austen,</hi> Saint <hi>Cyprian,</hi> Saint
  <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi> and Saint <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> say, That this is the
  meaning of that prayer which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
  daily make, <hi>And lead vs not into Temptation.</hi> Which carries with it a
  double sence. The one, Lead vs not (ô Lord) into Temptation, for our
  weakenesse and frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is exceeding great. So doth <hi>Petrus
  Chrisologus</hi> expound it. But because it is not a fitting language for a
  Souldier to desire of his Captaine, that hee should not send him foorth to
  fight; that other sence is more plaine, <hi>Suffer vs not (ô Lord) to
  fall into Temptation.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Though wee ought to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for
 Christs sake, wee should not yet seeke it.</note> But if thou wilt permit that
  wee must bee temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, yet consent not (ô Lord) that wee bee ouercome.
  And this sence, Saint <hi>Austen</hi> seemeth to approue in that his sermon,
  <hi>de Monte.</hi> But in what sence soeuer you take it, it is very true, that
  no man ought rashly to run himselfe into danger; And Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi>
  sayth, That no man should presume to offer his throat to bee cut by a tyrants
  knife, out of a desire that he hath to suffer for our Sauiours sake, but that
  hee waight his time and tarry till they take him and put him vpon the racke.
  <hi>Lactantius Firmianus</hi> sayth, That hee that vnnecessarily ventures vpon
  danger, ought not to bee stiled valiant, nor indeed is, but ought rather to bee
  ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted rash and inconsiderate: For hee that is truely valiant, is neither
  rash in daring, nor imprudent in fearing, nor weake in suffering; as Saint
  <hi>Austen</hi> hath <pb n="77" facs="tcp:22083:44"/> well noted. When the waues and windes
  of Temptation, blow, and beat hard against mans brest, and seeming to
  ouerwhelme him, hee remaineth firme as a Rocke, this is true fortitude indeed.
  In <hi>Dauids</hi> Tower (which is a Type of the Church) all the weapons of
  warre were defensiue, as Shields, and Targets, and Morrions; <hi>Mille clypei
  pendent ex ea.</hi> And it is further added, That these were the Armes and
  weapons of the strong and valiant men.</p>
               <p>Some will say, That there is no worke of vertue which is not
  subiect to temptation. Who did euer begin to walke in the way of perfection,
  who did not meet with a thousand phantasies? <hi>Diabolus enim semper per
  primordia boni pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sat, &amp; tentat rudimenta virtutum,</hi> saith
  <hi>Chrysologus</hi>; it beeing therefore needefull that wee should flie from
  temptation, shall it not bee likewise necessarie, that wee flie from
  perfection. Hereunto <hi>Thomas</hi> answereth, That to follow perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is a
  worke of the holy Ghost, who is the Author thereof; and hauing him for our
  second, to bring vs into the Field, wee need not to feare. They that in the
  Primitiue Church did people the Deserts and solitarie places, did no doubt
  perceiue that they should be set vpon and tempted: But because their end was
  not to play bo-peepe with the Deuill, and to goe about to mocke him, but to
  serue their God, and to enioy his fauour, they did not care a fig for all his
  temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. In a word, The temptations that wee are to flie from, are those
  which of their owne nature dispose vs vnto sinne; as vnlawfull games, offensiue
  con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersations, ill companie, dancing, masking, and idle Enterludes: for he
  that tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth Pitch shall be defiled therewith. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> writing to
  the Hebrews,<note place="margin">

  aduice, <hi>Deponentes omne pondus, &amp; circumstans nos peccatum, Laying
  euery weight aside, and the sinne that stands about vs.</hi> Where the word
  <hi>Circumstans</hi> is much to be weighed: for there are many things, which
  albeit they bee not sin, yet are they verie neere vnto sinne. And (as Saint
  <hi>Austen</hi> saith) as Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie doth round and gard the gates about the
  house of the Righteous, <hi>Circumuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litabat à longè misericordia

  spreddeth his nets round about vs to intrap vs: and therfore we must
  continually fixe our eye vpon Christ Iesus our onely Sauiour; <hi>Aspicientes
  in authorem fidei:</hi> that when the Deuill shall come to tempt vs, he shall
  finde him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe so stript of all occasions to cause vs to sinne, that hee shall
  bee forced to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take himselfe to stones, as he did against our Sauiour.</p>

                  <hi>That he might be tempted of the Deuill.</hi> It hath beene

 by the World or the Flesh.</note> That the temptation of the World and the
  Flesh could not take hold on Christ, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of that inward repugnance, and
  intrinsicall opposition which hee had with weakenesse and ignorance. And
  therefore it is commonly said, that the one is incident to the weake; the other
  proper vnto fooles. Of <hi>Thales Milesius</hi> they asked many questions, and

  hardest? The knowledge of a mans selfe: What the foolishest? The heart of a man
  that is giuen to the world. There being therefore deposited in our Sauiours
  brest all the treasures of Gods wisedome, hee could not bee tempted by the
  World, and lesse by the Flesh. And I verily beleeue, that though it was
  impossible for him to be tempted; yet if it had beene possible, hee would not
  haue consented to these temptations, to the end that he might aduise vs, that
  when the Deuill should set vpon vs with these weapons, we may giue our selues 
  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:22083:45"/> almost for lost. <hi>Funiculus triplex difficile rumpitur,

               <p>
                  <hi>When he had fasted fortie dayes.</hi> That voyce from
  Iordan, <hi>This is my beloued Son,</hi> made the Deuill the eagerer to set
  vpon him,<note place="margin">Why our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour would bee hungerie.</note> and to
  challenge him the Field. But Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> saith, that this our
  Sauiours fasting kept him still aloofe off from him, and made him so cowardly,
  that he was affraid to venture vpon him: and therefore did our Sauiour of
  purpose submit himselfe vnto hunger, that the Deuill might thereby be
  encouraged to come on the more boldly. <hi>Thomas</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it, That Fasting
  is such a weapon, that the Deuill dares not to come within the reach of it; for
  it makes Men to be like vnto Angels: And euer since that <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifer</hi> fell
  from Heauen, he hath liued stil in feare of his own shadow. <hi>Leo</hi> the
  Pope saith, That there are a certaine sort of terrible Deuills, against whom no
  coniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations nor exorcismes can preuaile, or doe any good; onely they cannot
  with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the force of Fasting. And of these our Sauiour Christ saith,
  <hi>This kind of Deuill is not cast out, but by Prayer and Fasting.</hi> Saint
  <hi>Basil</hi> saith, That our Sauiour Christ would not consent, that the Flesh
  which hee had taken of our nature <pb n="79" facs="tcp:22083:45"/> vpon him, should bee
  tempted, till he had armed it with fasting: Not that hee could incurre any
  daunger, but onely to teach vs how to stand vpon our guard. <hi>Athanasius</hi>
  sayth, That the Deuill hath suborned many in this life, to make show of beeing
  zealous of your welfare, and that they should goe about to persuade you, that
  you doe your selfe wrong in fasting, and that it makes you looke leane, and
  yellow, and spoyles your complexion. And as in Paradise, hee persuaded our
  Mother, by the Serpents insinuation, to eat of the forbidden Fruit; so now by
  his factors doth he persuade many to feasting, but none to fasting. Notable to
  this purpose, is that Historie of the Prophet whome God sent to Bethel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
  King <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> giuing him in charge, that hee should neither eate nor
  drinke in that place. He boldly deliuered his message, but durst not receiue of
  the King, that entertainement which he offered him; but as he returned
  home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, a false Prorphet came foorth, &amp; meeting him on the way, said
  vnto him, I pray ye depart not hence without seeing of your friends, &amp;
  receiuing such poore cheere as wee can make you. He told him that he had order
  from God not to do it. Then sayd the false Prophet, I haue had a reuelation to
  thecontrarie. Inconclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion the true Prophet beeing deceiued by the false
  Prophet, did eate. But in his iourney home a Lyon met him, and killed him. God
  aduising him that had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued him, of this sad Accident.</p>
               <p>Whence I inferre, That if it were a fault in the true Prophet to
  eat, by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing too light credit to the false Prophet; the offence will bee no
  lesse in you,<note place="margin">Motiues to induce vs to Fasting.</note> by
  giuing too easie beleefe to <hi>Satans</hi> Agent, who aduiseth thee, that thou
  shouldst not fast.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if hee that beeing deceiued, did eate, doth deserue
  the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of death, what shall hee deserue, that did deceiue him? And
  therefore God did notifie to the false Prophet the death of the true Prophet,
  to the end that the inequalitie of the sin, might persuade him, what kind of
  punishment hee did deserue.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the true Prophet payd the price of his sinne, with the
  losse of his life; but by repentance he saued his Soule. And one assured token
  thereof was, that the Lyon stood by him and guarded his Body, till they had
  giuen it buriall. But the false Prophet, had much more to answere for, and a
  greater reckoning to make. For if a light sinne, were so seuerely punished; how
  much more a greater? This Doctrine doth much concerne your cheu'rel-conscience
  Phisitions, who vpon euery light occasion giue licences for not fasting; &amp;
  those cockering Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who will not suffer their daughters to fast, fearing
  it would spoyle their colour, and marre their complexion; whereas in verie
  deed, nothing doth make the countenance so freshand so cleare as fasting doth;
  as those Histories of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dith,</hi> and those Babilonian children
  sufficiently proue, whose fasting made their faces as faire, as if they had
  beene so many Angels.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fortie dayes and fortie nights.</hi> To what end (will some
  say) serueth so much fasting? Wee are not able to imitate this act of our
  Sauiours. I answer, wee are to fast for two respects. The one, That many of our
  Sauiours miracles ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to bee admired, than imitated. The other, that
  by this his fasting, he layd thereby a greater obligation vpon vs to serue him;
  and that wee may by those poore fasts that we keepe, show therby, that we much
  both approue and esteeme that long fast of his.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hee was afterward hungrie. Theodoret</hi> sayth, That when
  the Deuill came to know that Christ began to grow hungrie, he did then
  certainly assure himself of victorie. <hi>Philon</hi> discoursing on the life
  of <hi>Moses,</hi> That for a man to suffer hunger <pb n="80" facs="tcp:22083:46"/> and
  thirst, it is verie great torment, and not to be endured, <hi>Graue est Domine,
  sitis &amp; fames.</hi> In the Desert God with-held the giuing of Manna for
  some few daies from his People; and the Text saith, That he did it for to proue
  them. And it is a great triall of our vertue, to suffer hunger for Gods cause;
  it is such a storme as is able to put a man besides his wits. When
  <hi>Ioseph</hi> dreamed of those seuen yeares of dearth, specified by those
  seuen leane Kyne, <hi>Theodoret</hi> hath noted, That he then foresaw, that the
  hunger of his brethren would force them to fall downe and worship him whom
  before they so much scorned and abhorred. The Deuill now thought himselfe
  cocke-sure, and thought to make his entrie at this little hole, and to get
  within him. <hi>Ecclesiasticus</hi> saith, That sinne is like the drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of
  raine, which by little and little sokes through the wall, till at last both it,
  and the house whereon it stands, fall suddenly to the ground. God comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
  <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> That he should take a tyle-stone, and paint thereon the holy
  Citie of Ierusalem,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ezech.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 1.</note>
  drawing round about it a great Armie, <hi>Sume tibi laterem, &amp;c.</hi> The
  like doth the Deuill; he desires no more of thee but a Tyle-stone, or the like
  toy, and out of that he will make Towers and walles, and bulwarkes, and armies
  of souldiers to besiege thee.</p>

  which spend all the whole day in plotting of mischiefe, and in working deceit,
  as if this were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen them to taske, and were hired so to doe. There is no
  day-labourer, bee hee neuer so hard a Workeman, but towards high noone doth
  rest himselfe a little: but the Deuill,<note place="margin">His diligence in
 following it.</note> 
                  <hi>Dolos, tota die meditabatur.</hi> It is said in the
  <hi>Reuelation,</hi> That cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Locusts came out of a bottomlesse Pit, and
  that they had a King ouer them, which is the Angell of the bottomlesse Pit,
  whose name in the Hebrew Tongue is <hi>Abaddon</hi>; in the Greeke,
  <hi>Apollyon,</hi> and in the Latine, <hi>Exterminans.</hi> Here is like to
  like, such souldiers, such a Captaine. Your Locusts neuer do good, but hurt,
  and this is the Deuills office; and therfore is he termed <hi>Exterminans.
  Dauid</hi> calls him by the name of Dragon, who with his verie breath doth
  taint the aire, and kills therewith the Birds that flie to and fro therein:
  <hi>Exterminauit eum aper de sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ua, The Boare of the Mountaine destroyeth the
  Lords Vineyard</hi>; he ouerthroweth Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasteries; through sloath and idlenesse
  soliciting Religious men to be negligent in comming to Church, carelesse in
  preaching, and loose in their life. In the marriage bed he soweth tares,
  treacheries, and lightnesse. With wordly men he persuadeth, That he is no bodie
  that is not rich; and therefore, bee it by hooke or by crooke, by right, or by
  wrong, he would haue thee get to be wealthie. In a word, he is generally set
  vpon mischiefe; and therefore hath hee the name of Tempter. But it is to be
  noted, that he doth then most hurt, when hee is most prouoked. <hi>Petrus
  Chrysologus</hi> saith, <hi>Est quidem Diabolus per se nequam, fit tamen
  ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quior, prouocatus.</hi> Like vnto your Dogge, who barkes out of custome, but
  if you throw stones at him he will barke the more: or like vnto the Bull in the

  fierce: or like vnto the Boare when he is wounded with the Speare; or the
  Beare, who <pb n="81" facs="tcp:22083:46"/> enraged, sets more furiously vpon the Hunter
  that pursues him, and throwes his Darts at him. There was a voyce alreadie
  thundred out against him from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, in the riuer of Iordan. Our Sauiours
  fasting was as stones throwne against a barking Curre; his being in the Desert
  was no fit place for him to worke his will, considering those good meditations
  wherein our Sauiour was then occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied: And therefore seeing himselfe thus
  crost, he would labour to make his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage, and trie what he could doe by
  the helpe of these other stones, as he had then a purpose to employ them.</p>
               <p>Touching the second, to wit, His craft and his subtletie,
  notable is that place of Saint <hi>Paul, We are not to wrestle with flesh and
  bloud, but with the snare of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ill</hi>: The Apostle doth not say, against
  his force and his power,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6.12.</note> though
  that bee great; but against his craft &amp; his subtletie, against his trickes
  &amp; deuices, &amp; against his plots and stratagems. <hi>Tertullian</hi>

                  <hi>which haue a thousand names, and a thousand
  wayes to hurt,</hi> as the Poet hath it. A cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Monke asked the Deuill,
  How he was called? He told him, <hi>Mille modis arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fex vocor, I am called a
  cunning Workeman.</hi> And therefore the Scripture stiles him Serpent, and a
  winding Snake, that rolls vp himselfe as it were in a circle. <hi>Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabit
  Dominus super Serpentem tortuosum,</hi> saith <hi>Esay. Eductus est coluber
  tortuosus,</hi> (saith <hi>Iob</hi>:) There is no Labyrinth so intricate, and
  so full of doublings &amp; tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, as is he. It is much doubt which of the
  two is most requisit in a Captaine, <hi>Virtus, an Dolus? Courage, or
  Craft?</hi> In the Deuill, if his power be incomparable, his subtletie is much
  more. Some of the antient Saints haue put it to question, Why the Deuill did
  appeare vnto our Mother <hi>Eue</hi> in the forme of a Serpent? Saint
  <hi>Chrysostom</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Why the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill appeared to Eue in
 the forme of a Serpent.</note> That God did giue him the libertie to make free
  choice of any one of the beasts of the Field, which soeuer he had most mind
  vnto; and, that he made choice of the Serpent, as of the wisest and subtillest,
  as the sacred Text deliuereth vnto vs. Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> That it was
  not in his election to chuse any other; to the end that the deceit and
  subtletie of the Serpent might stirre vp a kind of jealousie and warinesse in
  our Mother: For craft and cunning haue euer done more hurt than open force. The
  Wolfe is then most to bee fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red when he puts himselfe into Sheepes cloathing,
  or a Lyon in a Foxes skin; (which is the condition of your Heretickes.)
  <hi>Dauid</hi> speaking of those which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Deuils partie, saith,
  <hi>Partes Vulpium erunt.</hi> The Spouse calles them little Foxes, <hi>Vulpes
  paruulas, qui demoliuntur Vineas,</hi> Alluding in them, to the Deuills.</p>
               <p>Vpon this craft and subtletie of the Deuill, Saint
  <hi>Gregorie</hi> and S. <hi>Ciril</hi> ground this conceit, That the Deuill is
  not like your foolish Physitions, who with one receit cure diuers diseases; but
  against euerie vertue, good inclination, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Spirit, he hath
  such sundrie temptations, and so fit for euery mans humour, that if the tempted

                  </gap>ereth abroad amongst the People of this world; as those of

  laid for me, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But for all the Deuills cunning shifts, and for all his sleights
  and subtleties, he can neuer so wholly disguise himselfe, but that he will
  alwaies leaue one clouen foot vncouered, whereby (which is no small comfort
  vnto vs) we may come to know him. <hi>Iob</hi> speaking of the Deuill, in that
  metaphore of the Leuiathan; amongst many other properties aboue specified, he
  mentioneth this one, <hi>Luce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit post cum semita</hi>; He leaues behind him a
  white path in the sea, like vnto that froth which a great Ship causeth, when
  she hath a stiffe gale of wind in the poop of her. Whereby he signifieth vnto
  vs, That the Deuill which way soeuer he goes, leaues some signe behind him. At
  the feet of Saint <hi>Michael</hi> they paint the Deuill, with the faire bodie
  of an Angell, but with the foule taile of a Dragon. For albeit at the first
  sight he transfigure himselfe into an Angell of Light, yet in the end he will
  discouer himselfe to bee the Prince of Darkenesse. The Deuill hath beene seene
  to preach in the habit of a religious Frier, verie deuoutly, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing as an
  Angell of Light, persuading the People to repentance, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating great
  comfort vnto them; but in the end, all his Sermons haue ended in melancholly
  passions. For the Deuills Reuelations runne a contrarie course to Gods<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
  for these, although they somewhat trouble vs at the beginning, yet they end
  euermore in peace and comfort: but those of the Deuill, though they begin in

  stones, with such things wherein are scarce to be found any signe of danger:
  For hee alwaies hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the victorie to bee so much the more glorious, by how
  much the lesser is the occasion whereby he winnes it. <hi>Lot</hi> flies out of
  Sodome in the companie of his daughters, and hauing escaped that fearefull
  fire, the Deuil tempts the father by his daughters; whose raging lust, neither
  the fearefull example of their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whom their eyes had so lately seene
  turned into a Piller of Salt, nor the Lawes of Reason, nor of Nature, could
  once bridle or restraine. But you will say they were women; and what will not a
  woman doe to satisfie her longing? but that <hi>Lot</hi> should consent to so
  vnlawfull an act, beeing a man, nay; and so just a man as the Scripture
  commends him to be, it seemeth somewhat strange. Alas, (good old man) his
  daughters had made him drunke; and being so wearie and heauie hearted as hee
  was, to see the lamentable destruction of Sodome, it was not much that he
  should drinke, being importuned thereunto; &amp; they that could not find any
  water when hee called for it, could make a shift to fetch him wine. In all that
  fortie yeares peregrination of the children of Israell,<note place="margin">Why
 God allowed the Israelites no Wine, till they came into the land of

  them water out of the rocke, and twelue Fountaines in Helim; hee gaue them
  likewise Manna and Quailes: but not a drop of wine that they saw till they came
  to the Land of Promise. And surely this was thus ordered by the Councell of
  Heauen; for if hauing but wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they mutined so often, what would they haue
  done, had they had wine? When <hi>Abraham</hi> did thrust the bondwoman out of

  That he would not giue her any wine; for <hi>Agar</hi> signifies

  tempted their father, there beeing in the caue wherin he was, no other either

  <hi>Ahabs</hi> Captaine came to the foot of the Mountaine where <hi>Elias</hi>

  come down from Heauen, and burne vp thee, and those that are come along with
  thee; for thou oughtst not to speake with that little respect as thou doost, to
  Gods Seruant. What irreuerence is it then in the Deuil, to doubt whither hee
  were the Sonne of God, or no? I answer, That he shewed therein a great deale of
  irreuerence, but verie little feare. The more you sauour of God, the more
  im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently will he presse you: <hi>Ecce Sathanas expetiuit vt cribaret vos,

  to wheat, for the Birds abide in the fields, and the Grapes are out in the
  Vines; but your wheat is housed and laid vp safe vnder locke and key: For you
  are they that I make my treasure, and will as charily looke vnto you. There are
  a great sort of people that walke now at this present houre vp and downe the
  streets, some in one place, and some in another, of whom the Deuill makes no
  reckoning at all, he will deale hereafter with them at better leisure: but for
  one of Gods Saints, that is guarded, prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and defended by God, and is
  fenced about as a Rose amongst Thornes; for this, he will turne and returne,
  and vse a thousand shifts to get it. <hi>Nunquid auis discolor hareditas mea

                  <hi>If thou be the Sonne of God, command that these stones.</hi>
  If thou beest the Sonne of God, it comes to thee by inheritance to worke
  miracles vpon stones. <hi>Iacob</hi> had a stone for his pillow, and there thy
  father shewed him Heauen; and set vp a ladder, by which the Angells ascended
  and descended. To the Children of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell he did by stones a thousand fauours,
  extracting from them Water, Oyle, and Honey, <hi>Eduxit mel de petra, olcumque
  desaxo durissimo.</hi> And therefore it is not much that thou shouldst of these
  stones make bread. Wherein canst thou more manifest thy selfe to be the Sonne
  of God, than in sauing thine owne life, and in supplying thine owne wants? But
  this is that language which the Iewes vsed to our Sauiour at the foot of the
  Crosse; If he be King of Israell, let him vnloose those nailes that haue
  fastned him to the Crosse, and let him free himselfe from the power of Rome,
  and then the world shall acknowledge him to bee the same himselfe professeth.
  As also of that bad theefe, <hi>Saue thy selfe and vs.</hi> These thought (it
  should seeme) That to be King of the Iewes, and the Sonne of God, consisted in
  the sauing of himselfe and them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sifilius Dei es. Petrus Chrysologus</hi> is of opinion, That
  the Deuill here played the foole egregiously; <hi>Cupis, ô Daemon

  knowest not how.</hi> Foure thousand yeares and vpwards hadst thou exercised
  thy old trade, and yet thou now seemest to know lesse euery day than other. Is
  it possible, that thou shouldst bee such an Asse, as to offer stones to one
  that was now growne weake and readie to faint through too much fasting? Saint
  <hi>Ierome</hi> harpt vpon this string: Either hee was God, (sayth hee) or he
  was not God. If he were God, it was rashnesse in him to tempt him; if he were
  not God, he could not make bread of stones. But herein the Deuill shewed more
  malice than wit;<note place="margin">His malice of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runs his
 wit.</note> questionlesse he did vpon this occasion, as much as either he
  could, or knew. For others (as Saint <hi>Austen</hi> hath noted it) hee
  tempteth according to the measure of their strength, because God will not let
  out the rope to giue him any larger scope; but towards our Sauiour Christ, hee
  shewed the vtmost of his power and malice. And though hee did not greatly care,
  whether hee did eate or not eate, but had only a purpose to perplex and trouble
  our Sauiour, and to put him out of his holy Meditations, he did offer only that
  vnto him, which was precise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly necessary for the preseruation of mans life; and
  which a wise man ought to accept of, if hee were not madde or foolish. How much
  more should a man that is hunger-staru'd, attempt any thing rather than famish
  for lacke of food. <hi>Iudas</hi> will rather make money of Christ than starue.
  The mother sell her daughter, the father kill his children, the wife forsake,
  if not dishonour the bed of her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. And therefore the Deuill was not
  herein so verie a foole as some would make him.</p>

  O blessed Apostle, thou healest an Infidell with miracles, as a Saint, but

  thus, That <hi>Timothy</hi> had no neede of miracles for the good of his soule.

  our sweates and our labours, being to enioy some sweetnesse and content in this
  life, they inioy it most, and most safely, who inioy least of the pleasures of
  this life. For they that abound in Riches,<note place="margin">The more wealth

  Princes of this world, and your great powerfull men, haue more gold than
  gylding in their beds, but yet they haue no golden sleepes; their braines haue
  too much Quicke-siluer in them to settle to any rest. They haue their fat
  Capons and their daintie Pheasants set before them in vessels of siluer, but
  they haue leaden stomackes, and haue no appetite to eate. Whereas your
  husbandman sleepes betweene furrow and furrow, and that soundly, hauing a clod
  of earth for his pillow, and fals as hungerly to a Pilchard, and a cloue of
  Garlicke, as if hee had all the choice dishes in the world: For, <hi>Non in

  the Wildernesse, God drew water for them out of the Rocke, and it seemed
  sweeter vnto them than Honey, that is, <hi>De petra melle saturauit eos.</hi>
  It is a great comfort to a man, to haue a God that is able to make vs to be

  suis Deus, &amp;c.</hi> Saint <hi>Hierome,</hi> Saint <hi>Ambrose,</hi> Saint
  <hi>Bernard,</hi> and Saint <hi>Gregorie</hi> say, That the Deuill neuer
  desires to see any man climbe on high, vnlesse it bee for his greater
  destruction: For as he fell down like a thunder-bolt, so doth he desire to haue
  all men else to fall as he did, and that their sinnes may throw them headlong
  downe to Hell. Which is one especiall effect of his pride; according to that of
  <hi>Dauid, Dejecisti eos, dum eleuarentur</hi>; (or <hi>extollerentur,</hi> as
  Saint <hi>Austen</hi> readeth it.) <hi>Thou didst cast them downe, while they
  were lifted vp. Est aliquid humilitatis, &amp;c. There is somewhat in
  humilitie, which in a wonderfull manner lifteth vp the heart; and there is
  somewhat in pride, which casteth it downe.</hi> It is a miracle, that Pride and
  Humilitie should euer meet. Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> saith, That at the foot of
  the Crosse the Deuill did repeat the same les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son againe, <hi>Si Rex Israel
  est, descendat de Cruce, If thou be King of Israell, come downe from the
  Crosse;</hi> As though he had forgot the shame that Christ had put him to

               <p>

  it is to bee noted, That hee not onely pretendeth the holiest that is, should
  cast himselfe headlong from the Tower of Good-workes, but he that is seated on
  the Pinacle of the Temple, and in the highest dignitie in the Church. It is a
  lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table case, that the Prelate, the Priest, and the Preacher, should be put
  to this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill. <hi>Quis medebitur Incantatori, à Serpente percusso?

                  <hi>He hath giuen his Angels charge ouer thee.</hi> The main
  drift of the deuil, is, to flatter and sooth vs vp, that he may facilitate our
  fall; to sing sweetly vnto vs, to inchant vs like the Syren: <hi>Ossa eius
  sicut fistula aeris. Iob</hi> saith, That his bones (by which he vnderstands
  his strength) are Flutes, not of Reede, like those of <hi>Mida's,</hi> but of
  Brasse, which sound more sweetly. With these he vpholds his Empire, and sowes
  the World with Heresies, Moorismes, and Paganismes; and Hell, with damned
  Soules. They are Pipes that make strange consonancies with our incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
  and worke more powerfull effects, than those tongues that are tipt with the
  eloquencies of all the <hi>Tullies, Demostheneses,</hi> and
  <hi>Quintilians</hi> in the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Which is but an argument of the weaknes
  of their hands, when all their strength lies in their Tongues. Your weakest
  influences (say your Astrologers) insist vpon the Tongue. Woman (who is the
  embleme of weakenesse) hath her grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test force and strength in her tongue:
  Your Ruffians, and such as are swaggering fellows, haue more tongue than hands;
  but they that are truly valiant, haue more hand than tongue, they know not what
  the tongue meanes. The Roman Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers drew a Hand for their Deuice. In the
  Scripture the Hand signifieth Fortitude, <hi>Manus eius adhuc extenta est,</hi>
  so sayes <hi>Esay</hi> of God. The Deuill therefore beeing all Tongue, it
  followeth, that he must necessarily be a verie weake creature. Saint
  <hi>Peter</hi> calls him a Lyon, not because he deuoureth, but because he
  roares: So that <pb n="89" facs="tcp:22083:51"/> all our victorie consists in freeing our

  <hi>Iob</hi> alluded hereunto, when he speaketh of the Deuill in the metaphor
  of a Whale, <hi>Wilt thou bind his tongue with a cord?</hi> For the Deuill
  hauing all his strength in his tongue, see how that fish when the harping Irons
  hath caught hold on him, strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles on the sand, and beats himselfe vpon the
  beach, but all in vaine, to get loose, and at last swels &amp; bursts with

               <p>
                  <hi>His Angells.</hi> To those whom God loueth, and such as are
  his children, Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> saith, That God hath giuen order to his
  Angells, to gard and protect them; if a tyle should fal towards them, to strike
  it aside; if stumble, to take hold on them that they should not fall: How then
  could a person so holy, so beloued of God, be affraid? God did his People a
  great fauour in giuing them an Angel to be their Guide. <hi>Precedet te Angelus
  meus,</hi> sending an Angell to <hi>Daniel</hi> to feed him; to
  <hi>Tobias,</hi> to accompanie him in his journey; to Samaria, when
  <hi>Zenacharib</hi> so streightly besieged it, one Angell slaying so many
  thousands of braue valiant Souldiers. But greater is that fauour which he
  promiseth here to the Iust, <hi>Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis suis Deus mandauit de te.</hi> The
  Lyons garded <hi>Daniel</hi> in Babylon; the Whale, <hi>Ionas</hi>; the Arke of
  Bulrushes, <hi>Moses: In omnibus vijs tuis, In all thy ways,</hi> be it in the
  aire, in the earth, or in the sea, Gods Angels will so gard thee, that thou
  shalt not dash thy foot against a stone. Many Emperours and Kings haue
  scattered Gold on the ground, through which they haue gone; many haue beene
  drawne in their Chariots by Lyons and Elephants; but farre more pretious are
  the hands of Angells; and hee that hath them to helpe him, need not to touch
  theground with his feet.</p>

                  </note> The first

  course doth hee continue here with our Sauiour; and the same doth his followers
  the Hereticks obserue to this day. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> calls them, vnlearned,
  and wauering, and saith of them, That they depraue and peruert the Scripture,
  to their owne ruine and destruction. Saint <hi>Cyril</hi> hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth this point
  verie elegantly, in one of his Epistles: And <hi>Origen</hi> saith, That as the

  Hereticks by altering the Scripture, put strange fire to the Alter of Truth.
  Saint <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> That they immitate the Deuill, by citing Scripture
  falsely, as the Deuill did in this temptation, seeking (as it were) by a cleere
  and manifest truth, to persuade our Sauiour to entertaine a notorious lie, and
  to admit of a monstrous follie; se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing him, that his person should be
  protected by Angells, from any ensuing harme, if hee would but throw himselfe
  downe from the Pinacle of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. I terme it follie; for, as Man, hee had
  no reason to doe any such rash and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerate action; and, as God, hee had
  no neede to play the Tumbler, and to flie in the aire.</p>

  you reckon this so slight a temptation, and so poore an onset, as you would
  make it. For all Hell hath not a more powerfull peece of Ordnance to batter our

  In old time, all the States of the the world, were in competition about the
  electing of an Emperor among the Gods. The Priests, chose <hi>Appollo</hi> for
  his Wisedome; the Souldiers, <hi>Mars</hi> for his Valour; the Merchants,
  <hi>Mercurie,</hi> for his negociating; the Phisitions, <hi>Aesculapius,</hi>
  for the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie of his Cures. But when it was brought to that passe that
  they must settle vpon some one to bee Emperour, by a ioynt consent they all
  made choice of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> because hee was the God that came downe into
  the World in a showre of Gold.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>All these things will I giue thee.</hi> The Deuill, doth not
  here offer that which he is able to giue: But is rather so poore, That of all
  those Kingdomes, whereof he makes so large a profer, he hath not so much as one
  poore spike-hole in a wall. The richnesse of a Prince is to be seene in his
  Ward-robe and Richnesse of his prouision: There comes in before him a hundred
  Mules, Sumpter-Clothes on their backes, imbrodered with silke, siluer, and
  gold, with their goriets of mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie-plate, &amp;c. <hi>Iob</hi> painting foorth

  <hi>Want shall goe before his face.</hi> All his Ward-robe, is couered ouer

  no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but stones, and apples, making show of the one to our Sauiour, of the
  other to <hi>Eue.</hi> So that hee is so poore, that hee hath not so much as
  one farthing of all those immense treasures which hee offers; But he offereth
  that which he would giue, if hee were (as he is not) Lord of all the World.
  Such was the perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and anxietie of minde, that hee had, to know who was
  Christ our Sauiour, that if all the Kingdomes of the earth had beene his, hee
  would giue them all to see him humbled at his feet. Hee offers thee but little,
  because he makes little reckoning of thee; for thou art so base minded, that
  thou wilt sell thy selfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him at an easie rate.</p>
               <p>But how could the Deuil hope, with these onely seeming and
  apparent goods to worke so great a Conquest on so valiant a Brest? I answer,
  That it is the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils policie, to bait our Wils and Affections with the
  apprehension of imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie goods, rather than with the inioying of true and
  reall goods indeed. Nay, the glories of the World, once inioy'd, causeth a kind
  of surfet and loathing, which <pb n="91" facs="tcp:22083:52"/> is often an occasion of our
  growing out of loue with them. <hi>

 man than reall. Why.</note> as that the trees should not yeeld vs their
  fruites, the earth her food and riches, or that the Sunne should not shine. But
  because wee setting our whole delight vpon them, wee make them prooue vaine
  vnto vs. A clock is accounted a vaine thing when it strikes not true, but
  miscounts it's houres. The harmonie of this World is like a clocke, if a man
  imploy it wholly in his pleasures, it makes him become vaine. But
  <hi>Salomon</hi> spake not a word of these things, till hee had made triall of
  them. When the Prodigall went out of his Fathers house, Paradises of delights
  were presented vnto him, but when he was gone far from him, all was hunger,
  nakednesse, &amp; miserie. This punishment inflicted vpon him, made him open
  his eies and see his errour. <hi>Amnon,</hi> enamoured of <hi>Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

  his life did consist in the inioying of her; nay hee counted it his heauen: But
  hee had no sooner had his pleasure of her, but he kicked her out of doores, and
  could not indure the sight of her. The possessing of riches, is not of it selfe
  either good or bad; onely the good vse of them, makes them good, the bad, bad.
  And therefore beeing desired by vs, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> stileth them,
  temptation, and <hi>Sathans</hi> snare, <hi>Qui volunt diuites fieri, in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

  Diaboli,</hi> (i.) <hi>They that will bee rich fall into Temptation: and into
  the snare of the Deuill.</hi> So that your imaginarie goods, worke more vpon
  vs, and with more aduantage, than those which wee inioy and possesse. And the
  reason is, for that the Deuill doth represent more glorie to the imagination,
  in such an office, such a dignitie, such riches, such beautie, and such
  delights, than is true, <hi>Facinatio enim nugacitatis obscurat bona, &amp;
  inconstantia concupiscentiae, transuertit sensum.</hi> His cunning witch-craft
  doth peruert the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, and makes vs take Ill, for Good. This is that
  which our Sauiour Christ called, <hi>Crapulam &amp; ebrietatem saeculi,</hi> A
  kind of drunkennes, wherwith the men of this World are ouertaken, <hi>Et
  inconstantiam concupiscentiae.</hi> And the Greeke text vseth the word
  <hi>Funda</hi>; For as that goes alwayes round, so doth concupiscence, euerie
  moment altering our desires. There are some kind of pictures, which if you
  looke one way vpon them seeme faire and beautifull, if another way, foule and
  ougly, and full of horror. Such doth the Deuill set before thee; Thou must haue
  therefore an eye to the one as to the other, looke as wel what is to come, as
  what is present before thee, least the Deuill chance to deceiue thee.</p>

            <p>Concerning this Article, which is so notorious, there is not a
Prophet, an Euangelist, a Sybil, nor any of the holy Fathers, which do not make
confession thereof; yea, the verie Angells said vnto the Disciples, <hi>This

<hi>[Sic] So,</hi> doth not so much <hi>exprimere modum,</hi> as

likenesse he shall come. Now doth he sit at the right hand of his Father, and
shall possesse that Throne till that he shall come to iudge the world, and make
his enemies his footstoole. According to that of <hi>Dauid, Sit at my right

repeated after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> to the Hebrews. Not that the sitting

<hi>Vntill</hi> doth not point at any set time) but the mutation of the place

Saint <hi>Luke</hi>: And by reason of the notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse thereof, the

               <hi>The Sonne of Man.</hi> Iudiciarie power, or this <hi>Potestas
judiciaria</hi> (as the Schoole-men call it) is proper to all the Trinitie, but
is here attributed to the Sonne, as <pb n="94" facs="tcp:22083:54"/> Wisedome is likewise
attributed vnto him, which is the soule of the Iudge. So that the Sonne (as he
is God) is the eternall Iudge, and the Lord vniuersall, to whom the Father hath
communicated this dominion by an eternall gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. <hi>Generando non
largiendo,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Ambrose.</hi> But as he is man, the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Trinitie gaue him this power <hi>in tempore,</hi> by vniting him to our nature;
<hi>Hee gaue him power to doe judgement</hi>: And Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> giues the
reason thereof, <hi>Because he is the Sonne of Man</hi>; it beeing held fit
that Man should be saued by Man; Gods mercie gaining thereby glorie; and Mans
meannesse, authoritie. And therefore it was thought fit, that Man should be
iudged by Man; Gods justice remaining thereby iustified; and Mans Cause
secured: For, What greater securitie can man haue, than that hee should bee
Mans Iudge, who gaue his life for Man, shedding his bloud on the Crosse for
Mans saluation? So doth Saint <hi>Austen</hi> expound that place alledged by
Saint <hi>Iohn, Dedit ei judicium facere, quia filius hominis est.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the one side here is matter of hope &amp; comfort; on the
other, of feare and trembling:<note place="margin">No smal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort that Christ
  shal be our Iudge.</note> Who will not hope for pittie from a man, and such a
man that is my brother, my aduocate, my friend, who to make me rich, had made
himselfe poore? &amp;c. But who can hope for any comfort from that man that was
iudged, sentenced, and condemned vniustly by man vnto death? Who can hope for
any good from that man whose loue man repaid with dis-loue, and whose life,
with death? These Yrons are too hard for the stomacke of man to digest, it had
need of some Ostriches helpe. <hi>I will not destroy Ephraim, because I am God,
and not Man</hi>: God is woont to requite bad with good, discourtesies with
benefits; &amp; his loue commonly encreaseth when mans diminisheth, but mans
brest is somewhat streighter laced.<note place="margin">Againe, no small
  terrour.</note> In a word, This his beeing Man is a matter of feare, and by how
much the more was Mans obligation, by so much the more shall the son of mans
vengeance bee: For the pretious bloud of our Sauiour Iesus Christ, and his
cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell, yet blessed wounds, are the Sanctuarie of our hopes, especially to
those that trust in him, and lay hold on him by Faith: but for the vnthankefull
sinner, they shall be matter of cowardise, and of terrour; and to our Sauiour
Christ minister occasion of greater punishment, and a more rigorous reuenge.
<hi>Esay</hi> introduceth the Angels questioning our Sauior at his entrance
into Heauen, <hi>Quare rubrum est vestimentum tuum sicut calcantium in
torculari? Why are thy garments, ô Lord, like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to those that tread the
Wine-presse?</hi> You say wel; for I haue troden, like the grapes, my enemies
vnder foot, and my garments are sprinkled and stained with their bloud. O Lord,
this bloudie spoyle would well haue beseemed thee on earth; But what doost thou
make with it here in Heauen? <hi>Dies vltionis in corde meo</hi>; The day will
come when I shall bee reuenged at full of those ill requited bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits which I
bestowed on my People; and all that patience which I then s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Mathew, Sanguis eius super nos, Let his bloud be vpon vs and our
chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi>; saith thus, The time shall come, that the bloud that might haue
giuen you life, shall occasion your death; it shall be vnto you worse than that
Fire of Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, which the King intended for death, though in the end it
turned to life: The bloud of Christ was intended for life, but it shall end in
death. <hi>Hosea</hi> saith, <hi>V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Another Translation hath it, <hi>Caro mea ab eis.</hi> When the Sonne of mans
mercie was come to that heigth, as mans thought could not set it higher; to
wit, That God in mans fauour should take mans flesh vpon him; woe vnto those
men who were vnmindfull of so great a blessing: for this extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie
courtesie of his being so vnthankfully entertained, and so ill requited, shall
be their condemnation, for whose saluation it was intended. <hi>Cornua eius

               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:22083:54"/> saith <hi>Deutronomie</hi>: The

            <p>Saint <hi>Austen</hi> collecteth hence another conuenience: Euerie
iudgement (saith he) requireth two especiall and important things:</p>
            <p>The one, That the Iudge feare not the face of the Mightie.</p>
            <p>The other, That he hide not his face from him that is brought
before him.<note place="margin">Two proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of a Iudge.</note>
            </p>
            <p>For the first, The Scripture hath it euerie where, <hi>Regard not
the countenance of the Mightie.</hi> For the second, <hi>Iob</hi> pondering the
perdition of a certain Prouince, saith, That the Iudges thereof would not
suffer themselues to be seen;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iob.</hi> 9. <hi>v.</hi>
  24.</note> 
               <hi>The earth is giuen into the hands of the Wicked; he couereth the
faces of the Iudges.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God will not be seene by the damned;
for by their verie seeing him, they should be freed from their punishment: and
therefore in this respect it was fit that Christ should come to iudge the world
as Man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In Maiestate sua, In his Maiestie.</hi> The Interlinearie hath
it, <hi>In Diuinitate</hi>; Saint <hi>Chrysostome, In Gloria</hi>; Saint
<hi>Luke, In Maiestate sua, in Patris, &amp; sanctorum Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorum.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luke</hi> 9. <hi>v.</hi> 26.</note> Where it is noted by Saint
<hi>Ambrose,</hi> That his Maiestie was greater than that of his father;
<hi>Quia Patri inferior, videri non poterat</hi>: For in what place soeuer the
Father should be, it could not bee presumed that hee should be lesse than his
Son; but of his Son it might perhaps haue bin presumed otherwise: into which
errour <hi>Arrius</hi> did afterwards fall.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In Maiestate sua, &amp;c.</hi> Our words here want weight, and
our weake apprehension, matter and forme worthie so great a Maiestie. In a
Prince, a Lord, and in a Iudge, is necessarily required a kind of presence and
authoritie beyond other ordinarie men. <hi>Esay</hi> reporteth of his People,
That seeing a man of a goodly presence, and well clad, they said vnto him,
<hi>Thou hast rayment, be our Prince.</hi> Nor is this onely necessarie, but
that his greatnesse and his Maiestie bee euerie way answerable to the
largenesse of his Commission and Iurisdiction. And therefore our Sauiour Christ
being then to shew himselfe a King of Kings, and a Lord of Lords, and an
vniuersall Iudge ouer all persons, and ouer all causes since the first
beginning of the world, to the end thereof, his Maiestie must needs be
incomparable.</p>
            <p>First, In respect of his person,<note place="margin">The maiestie of
  Christ at his comming to iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</note> whose splendor and brightnesse shall
eclipse and darken all the lights of the World. At this his comming, his glorie
at the first (I mean of his soule) was reserued and hid, so that therein they
might not see the fearefulnesse of their punishment: but in his comming to
Iudgement the light of his bodie shall be so shining, and so extreamely bright,
that the Sunne in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison of it shall seeme as a candle. Saint
<hi>Ambrose</hi> calleth the Sunne, the Grace of Nature, the Ioy of the World,
the Prince of the Planets, the bright Lanterne of the World, the Fountaine of
Life, the Image of God, whom for it's beautie so many Nations adored as a God:
But in that day, the Sunne, and the Moon it's Vicegerent, whom they call the
Queene of Heauen, shall be like vnto those lights of the Sheepheards, which are
hardly to be discerned afarre off. Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> made in his
<hi>Apocalyps</hi> a description of this Maiestie and beautie; hee saw the
Heauen opened, and that a Horseman came forth, riding on a white Horse; from
his eyes flamed forth two Torches of fire; from his mouth issued a two edged
Sword; in his hand he had a Rod of Yron; on his head many Crowns; and on his
thigh a Letter, which beeing read spake thus, <hi>The King of Kings, and Lord
of Lords</hi>: Great Armies of Horsemen did attend him, all on white Horses.
This is a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure and Type of our Sauiour Christs comming to Iudgement. The
white horse <pb n="96" facs="tcp:22083:55"/> is his most holy and vnspotted Humanitie.
Those flaming Torches of his eyes betoken, That all things both great and small
shal be laid open to his sight, there shall not be any sinne so secret, nor any
fault so buried vnder ground, which shall not appeare at that generall Triall;
that beeing then to be verified of euery Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, which God said to
<hi>Dauid</hi> touching his murder and adulterie; <hi>Thou hast done it
secretly, but I will doe it in the sight of the Sunne.</hi> The two edged Sword
signifies the finenesse and sharpenesse of the Iudges proceeding, and that he
is able to cut in sunder the marrow and bones of a Sinner; and like a Razor
meet with the least haire of euill that shall shew it selfe. His Rod of Yron
shewes the firmenesse and constancie of his Iudgment, which shall not, like
those white Wands which the Iudges bare before, be wrested this way and that
way at pleasure. Those many Diadems on his head, intimate those Crownes that he
shall clap on the heads of the Righteous, and those that haue done well. That
glorious Letter of <hi>Rex Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gum,</hi> because he shal there shew himselfe to
be King of Kings, &amp; Lord of Lords, many Kings of the earth shall haue their
knees smitten like <hi>Balthazars,</hi> and their hearts throb within them,
when they stand before his presence expecting their fearefull doome. Lastly,
hee shall come accompanied with many Horsemen on white Horses, to shew vnto vs,
that hee shall bee waited on by all the Court of Heauen. <hi>Salomon</hi>
saith, <hi>Tria sunt quae bene gradiuntur, quartum quod foelicitèr
ince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit; Three creatures haue a goodly kind of gate, the Sheepe, the Lyon, and
the Cocke</hi>; but a King, whom none can resist, carries more state with him
than them all. Saint <hi>Gregorie</hi> typifieth this prouerbe to our Sauiour
Christ, who did gallantly beare himselfe in foure of his most famous
mysteries.</p>
            <p>First, In that of his Redemption, represented in the sheep which
is made rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die for the Sacrifice.</p>
            <p>Secondly, In his Resurrection, figured in the Lyon, <hi>Vicit Leo
de Tribu Iuda.</hi> Whereunto Saint <hi>Paul</hi> doth attribute our
justification, <hi>Resurrexit propter justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem nostram.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, In his preaching of the Gospell, fitly expressed in the
Cocke, who with his crowing and clapping of his wings, awakeneth those that are
asleepe in sinne.</p>
            <p>But his comming to judgement, which is deciphered vnto vs in his
beeing a King, doth farre exceed all the rest: For many were not bettered by
his Death, nor his Resurrection, nor his Doctrine, (though these were most
pretious Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures proffered to Mankind) because that Age wherein Christ came
was an Age of contradiction; but in this his comming to judgement that
prophecie of <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charie</hi> shall be fulfilled,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Zach.</hi> 14.</note> 
               <hi>And there shall bee one Lord ouer
all the earth, and his name shall be one.</hi> Till then, this King shall goe
by little and little, ouercomming and subduing his enemies; but when he shall
come in his glorie, then shall wee see a most stately triumph, and a quiet and
peaceable possession: and that Stone which <hi>Daniel</hi> saw loosed and
vnfastned from the Mountaine, shall then cease to pound and beat into pouder
all the Empires and Seigniories of the earth; <hi>Thou shal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>yed, nor serued by vs
as he should bee, no, not of the Iust themselues, and those that are the Elect
children of God. So doth Saint <hi>Austen</hi> declare that place of the
<hi>Canticles, Exui me tunica mea, quomodo indu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

coat, How shall I put it on? I haue washed my feet, How shall I defile
them?</hi> How is this to be borne withall, how is this to be suffered (saith
this sacred Doctor) that the Spouse should vse this libertie with her best
Beloued? Whereunto he answereth, That the Iust do <pb n="97" facs="tcp:22083:55"/> not
denie vnto God his entrance into the house of their Soules; but the Spouse doth
there discouer the resistance which the Soule makes in the behalfe of the
Sences, at that time when as God calls her vnto him. But in the day of
Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Soule shall be no more mis-led by the Sences, but shall
perfectly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come subiect to the will of God; so that the Sonne of God shall
appeare then in greater power and Maiestie than euer hee did before. But for to
treat of the Maiestie of the Father, the greatest and deepest thoughts of Man
is but as a Thimble, they are not able to conceiue, much lesse to containe the
least part thereof. <hi>Daniel</hi> saith, seeking to expresse the greatnesse
of his glorie, and the mightinesse of his power, <hi>Mille millia ministrabant
ei, &amp; decies centena millium assist<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

thousands, and the Courtiers that assist in his presence, by ten thousands of
thousands: Arithmeticke wants figures to set downe these numberlesse numbers.
<hi>Esay</hi> saw him in a Throne of Maiestie and of glorie, <hi>Plena erat
domus Maiestate eius</hi>; but his feet and his head couered with the wings of
Seraphins: Giuing vs thereby to vnderstand, That these our corporall eyes may
haue a glimpse of the Maiestie of his Throne, but not of his person.</p>
            <p>Lastly, That Maiestie of his Court, which consists of so many
Angelicall Hierarchies, What tongue! what tongue can paint out that vnto thee,
which is beyond the proportion of thought? One Angell alone hath strucke with
the feare of death the valiantest &amp; the holiest men that euer were; what
would they then doe when they are a joynt and vnited Bodie? Saint
<hi>Chrysostome</hi> saith, That greater is the power of one Angell, than of
all the men in the world, if all their force and strength were molten together,
and molded into one entire masse. At Christs birth, certaine Squadrons of
Angells came round about him, saluting him with that heauenly Song of,
<hi>Gloria in excelsis</hi>: but now they shall come trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping all together,
and some shall more particularly bewaile with great bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, those
miseries that shall befall the World, and those that liued therein; according
to that of <hi>Esay, The Angels of Peace shall weepe bitterly.</hi>

            <p>The Euangelist doth not here in this place vnderstand the euill
Angels, though they shall come likewise vpon this Theatre, as well to bee

Atturneys for to open the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners crimes and offences, and as Hangmen, to
execute the Iudges Sentence. In this life God oftentimes makes the good Angels
to bee the Executioners of his wrath, as in Sodome, and in the first borne of
Aegypt, in ouerthrowing the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> in <hi>Zenacharib,

  summe of the Law, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> writeth to the Romans.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He maketh mention onely of the workes of mercie, for
  to expell that errour wherein many liue in this life; to wit, That this
  businesse of Almes-deeds is not giuen vs as a Precept whereby to bind vs, but
  by way of councel and aduice, whereby to admonish vs. And this is a great signe
  &amp; token of this truth, for that there is scarce any man that accuseth
  himselfe for the not giuing of an Almes: But withall, it is a foule shame for
  vs to thinke that God should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne so many to eternal fire, for their not
  shewing pittie to the Poore, if it were no more but a bare councell and aduice.
  <hi>Gregorie Nazianzen,</hi> in an Oration which he makes of the care that
  ought to bee had of the Poore; proueth out of this place, That to relieue the
  poore and the needie, is not <hi>Negotium voluntarium, sed necessarium,</hi>
  not a voluntarie, but a necessarie businesse. And Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> and
  <hi>Thomas</hi> are of opinion, That we are bound to relieue the necessities of
  our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, be it with food, or apparell, or councell, or our assistance,
  according to the measure of their necessitie, and our abilitie, gouerning our
  selues therein accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the rules of wisedome.</p>
               <p>Hence it followeth, that the sinne of crueltie carries with it a
  kind of despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. For (as Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith) he must be
  condemned to eternal fire, who hath not cloathed the naked, who hath not fed

                  <hi>that shewes not mercie in this life.</hi> One of the reasons, why
  <hi>Hamon,</hi> King <hi>Assuerus</hi> his great Fauourit, found no pittie in
  Queen <hi>Esters,</hi> nor the Kings brest, though he besought it on his knees,
  and with teares in his eyes, was, for that he had plotted such a mercilesse
  tyrannie, as to destroy all the Iews both men, women, and children, at one
  blow; and therefore deserued no fauour. <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

  hauing many Sheepe of his owne, had robbed his Neighbour of his onely Sheepe,

  an iniurie, that he held <pb n="101" facs="tcp:22083:57"/> him for the present vnworthie of
  pardon; <hi>As the Lord liueth, he is the child of death.</hi> In a word, the
  Word of God cannot faile. And <hi>Amos</hi> in his fourth and sixth Chapter,
  threatneth those powerfull cruell ones with most seuere punishments. And
  <hi>Salomon</hi> saith, That the hard heart shall haue many a shrewd pang when
  he lies on his death bed.</p>
               <p>This Doctrine hath in it's fauour three powerfull reasons.</p>
               <p>The first, In the secular state; for the elder brother is bound
  to maintaine his younger brothers, and vpon this condition is hee made the
  heire of his house; otherwise he should be condemned for vnkind and cruell. God
  (saith Saint <hi>Basil</hi>) made the rich man the elder brother, that he might
  relieue his younger brother, the Poore. And <hi>Malachie</hi> saith, That the
  hungrie, the naked, and the maimed man, on whom the rich man bends his brow, is
  his brother; that they haue one and the same God to their Father, &amp; one and
  the same Church to their Mother.</p>
               <p>The second, Our Sauiour Christ is not contented that thou
  shouldst make ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that thou giuest thy brother an almes, but thy selfe:
  And he doth reueale this truth, and notifie it vnto thee, to the end that thou
  shouldst not despise the Poore; <hi>Haec requies mea, reficite lassum, hoc est
  meum refrigerium.</hi> How is it possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble (ô Lord) that the succouring
  of the Poore should be thy ease and thy refre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing? Because I (saith our
  Sauiour) am that poore Man; and happie is hee, who vnder the ragges of the
  Poore, diuideth the riches of God.</p>
               <p>The third, That this charitie towards the Poore giues vs an
  assurance of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen: <hi>Charitie affoords great confidence to all that

                  <note place="margin">

  <hi>Micheas</hi> treating of a punishment that God was to inflict vpon his

  man to bewaile the desperate torments of Iudgement, and of Hell? This

               <p>The first sort that shall suffer the seuerest punishment, shall

  horror of their punishment, that they shall cry vnto the mountaines, and call

               <p>The second sort, are those cast-awayes, that haue made a

  Communicants, of whome Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> That they eate and drinke their

  sayd <hi>Esay</hi> asketh, <hi>Which of you can dwell with the deuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Fire?
  Aut quis habitabit cum ardoribus sempiternis?</hi> Are ye of that mettall, that
  yee can suffer eternall fire, who are not able to indure temporall heate? Let
  the most desperat amongst you, he that imagines he is able to indure any
  torment, put but his finger awhile into the flame but of a candle, and hee will
  soone tell mee another tale.</p>
               <p>The third sort, are those that professe a perpetuall and
  euerlasting hatred to Vertue and Goodnesse, follow tyranny with delight, and
  take a pleasure in sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, thinking there is no life to that which is
  vicious: According to that of <hi>Esay, Hee that departeth from euill, maketh
  himselfe a prey</hi>; It is death to them, to doe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise. And as
  <hi>Hosea</hi> hath it, <hi>Sanguis, sanguinem tetigit,</hi> Against these, God
  shall come armed with a corslet of Iustice, and with robes of Vengeance, and
  with a cloake of Zeale, and like a swift torrent, he shall sweepe away these
  reeds and bulrushes, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The fourth sort, are those who deny God eyes to see the infinite
  summe and masse of those things that passe amongst men. First, because in
  themselues they are materiall; and God is a pure Spirit, and incorporeall, and
  therefore they dreame hee hath no eyes to see our actions. Secondly, because
  humane actions are oftentimes so nastie and so loathsome, that God will not
  vouchsafe to stoope so low,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Psal.</hi> 93.</note> as to
  looke vpon them. <hi>Et dixerunt, non videbit Dominus nec intelligit Deus
  Iacob.</hi> Against these men, sayth <hi>Dauid, Intelligite insipientes in

  sapite, O yee fooles when will yee vnderstand? Qui plantauit au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem, non
  audiet? aut qui finxit oculum, non considerat?</hi> God gaue man eares, eyes,
  vnderstanding, and reason, and shall all these faculties be wanting to him? All
  the perfection of these effects are most eminent in the primary cause. And
  therfore, if God gaue man his hearing, his sight, &amp; his vnderstanding, much
  more must hee inioy them, who was the Author and onely giuer of them. <hi>Qui
  corri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit gentes, non arguet? Qui docet hominem scientiam,</hi> (i.) <hi>He
  that correcteth the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons shall he not reprooue? He that teacheth man
  knowledge, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fift sort, are those, who acknowledging in God his
  Prouidence, and his Iustice; yet will not bee persuaded, that it can be so
  seuere in that day. So saith the Psalmist; <hi>Secundum multitudinem irae suae
  non quaeret</hi>: And the cause is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently rendred, <hi>Diuisi sunt ab ira,
  vultus eius. Sophonia,</hi> painting out certaine men vnto vs drowned in their
  vices, saith, <hi>Defixos in faecibus eius, They are drowned in the dregges of
  their sinnes.</hi> And by and by giueth a reason for it; <hi>Dicunt enim in
  cordibus suis, non faciet Dominus bene, non faciet Dominus male.</hi> On the

Chapters,<note place="margin">Iustification a greater worke than Creation.</note>
               <hi>In Tomo miraculorum,</hi> which was a fit place to treat thereof. For
<hi>Origen</hi> saith, That this was a greater miracle than Christs turning of
Water into Wine, at the Wedding in Canaan. And Saint <hi>Hierome,</hi> That it
was greater than any other of our Sauiours miracles; <hi>Inter Signa omnia,
quae fecit, hoc videtur mirabilius</hi>: And the reason is, For that in
<hi>Lazarus</hi> that was dead, and in the Man that was blind, hee met with no
contradiction or repugnancie: but for to mooue so many, nay, so innumerable
wills as those of Ierusalem, and that they should be drawne to receiue him as
their King and Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias, whom the Clergie and Nobilitie did so much hate &amp;
abhorre, carries with it a plaine and manifest resistance. And, as Saint
<hi>Augustine</hi> saith, That to iustifie a Soule, is more than to create
Heauen and Earth, in regard of the opposition which the will of Man may make
thereunto; so, for our Sauior to mooue those that were aliue in that most
populous Citie, was more than to raise the dead.</p>
            <p>And for confirmation of this Doctrine, let vs suppose that the
earth is of that stabilitie and firmenesse, that to mooue it is a Blazon or
Cognisance only belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging vnto God. <hi>Ecclesiasticus</hi> saith, <hi>Terra
autem in eternum stat.</hi> And <hi>Athanasi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s</hi> giuing the reason thereof, saith, That God did knit and
fasten it in the middest of the world with such strong chains, that it remained
altogether immoouable, as beeing the Center to all the rest which God had
created. <hi>Qui fundasti terram super stabilitatem suam</hi>: The Greeke reads
it <hi>Securitatem,</hi> or <hi>Infallibilitatem.</hi> And <pb n="105" facs="tcp:22083:59"/> therefore many Phylosophers were of opinion, That all the power of
the Gods were not able to mooue it from it's place. But because nothing is
impossible vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God and his omnipotent power, the Scripture almost in euerie
place saith, That the Heauen, the earth, and that which is vnder the earth, and
all the firme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and strong foundation thereof, are mooued, and shake and
tremble at the twinckling of his eyes. If then to mooue the Earth (which is a
dead thing, and which cannot make resistance, nor contradiction) bee onely the
Blazon and Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisance of God; What a thing then is it, to mooue this liuing
Earth, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyes it's owne libertie, and may out of it's stubbornenesse
say vnto God, I will not. But admit it should say, I will, the miracle is no
lesse, but rather a manifest token of Gods diuine power and omnipotencie.</p>
            <p>It is likewise to be noted, That all the entrances which our
Sauiour Christ made, were with a great deale of noyse and clamour. In that
first which he made in the world, <hi>Haggie</hi> prophecied,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hag.</hi> 1.</note> That he should turne the Heauen and the
Earth topsi-turuie. And God did performe it, vsing as his Instrument therein,
the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Octauianus Augustus.</hi> In that which hee made into Aegypt,
he did trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble all that Kingdome, by throwing their Idolls downe to the
ground, as it was prophecied by <hi>Esayas, Commouebuntur simulachra
Aegypti</hi>: So doth <hi>Procopius</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it, <hi>Eusebius,
Athanasius,</hi> and Saint <hi>Austen</hi>: But say, That in these his
entran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces there was a generall motion, yet was there not a generall obedience.
But here <hi>Commota est vniuersa Ciuitas</hi>: The Greeke saith, <hi>Velut
terrae motu concussa fuit.</hi> As if it had suffered an vniuersal earthquake;
there was neither old man, nor wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, nor child, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This is a great <hi>encarecimiento,</hi> or endeering of the
matter.</p>
            <p>First, Because our Sauiour preaching about the Cities and Townes
of that Kingdome, the Euangelists deliuer vnto vs, That all the Inhabitants
that were in those parts, left their houses and their villages emptie and
forsaken, and only for to follow him. S. <hi>Marke,</hi> he saith, <hi>Et
conueniebant ad eum vndique, vt iam non posset manifeste introire in Ciuitatem,
sed in Desertis locis esset.</hi> And Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> That they troad one
another vnder foot, and crusht the breath out of their bodies, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to
presse to heare him; <hi>Ita vt se mutuò suffocarent.</hi> But it is to
be supposed, that many likewise staid at home; but in this his entrance into
Hierusalem, God would haue this lot to light vpon all, and therefore it is
said, <hi>Vniuersa Ciuitas, The whole Citie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ondly, In regard of
the infinite number of Inhabitants that were in that Citie; which (as
<hi>Plinie</hi> reporteth) was in those dayes the famousest in all the East:
And, in a manner, all those that haue writ thereof make mention of foure
millions of persons. <hi>Iosephus</hi> relateth, That the President of Syria
beeing desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to render an account vnto <hi>Nero,</hi> of the greatnesse of
that Commonwealth, did desire of the high Priests, that they would giue him a
true note of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of those Lambs which they sacrificed one Sabboth,
which were afterwards eaten by seuerall companies and Housholds, some
consisting of ten, some of 15, and some, 20 soules; and they found,<note place="margin">The greatnes of the Iewish Sacrifices.</note> that they did
sacrifice at euerie one of those their solemne Sabboths, two hundred fiftie six
thousand and fiue hundred Lambes; which, according to the rate of fifteene
persons in a companie, amount to foure millions and fiue hundred thousand. But
withall, it is to be noted, that neither the Sicke nor the children were
present thereat. But here, <hi>Vniuersa Ciui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas, The whole Citie</hi> came,
some out of passion, and some out of affection.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, For that our Sauior Christ was alreadie condemned to
death by the Chapter house of the Clergie, who had called a Conuocation, to
send out <pb n="106" facs="tcp:22083:60"/> Serjeants and Souldiers for the apprehending of
him, and had published Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations of rewards to those that should bring him
bound vnto them: that then, and at such a time the whole Citie should receiue
him with Songs and acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of King, Messias, and God (being a proscribed
man, and doomed to death) <hi>Haec mutatio dextrae excelsi, This was an
alteration which could not proceed but from the most High.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>The whole Citie was mooued.</hi> Ierusalem had beene long
  settled in it's vices, <hi>Visitabo super viros defixos in sordibus suis, Moab
  requieuit in faecibus suis,</hi> I will search Ierusalem with candles, and
  punish the men that are settled on their lees, &amp;c. And as the wise
  Phisitions stirre and trouble the humours, cause loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things and gripings in the
  stomacke; so our Sauiour Christ in the breast of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one causeth a
  squeamishnesse of the stomacke by moouing and stirring those foule dregges of
  sinne wherewith they were corrupted. <hi>Et commota est vniuersa

  some great and violent vomit; for euerie one of these accidents make a pause in
  the humours, and detaine the spirits: An Ague hath been seen to be put out of
  his course, and quite taken away by the sudden draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a sword vpon the
  Patient: and a Palsey driuen away with the sight of a mans enemie. And
  <hi>Horace</hi> telleth vs, That a couetous Miser was recouered of a great
  Lethargie, by the Physitions feigning that his heires were carrying away his
  bagges of money, and the Chests wherein his Treasure lay. In like manner, in
  the infirmities of the Soule, one turbation, one disquieting, one breaking vp
  of those Chests wherein our sinnes are massed vp, may bee the recouerie of our
  perdition. This made <hi>Dauid</hi> to say of his Soule, <hi>Sana contritiones

  consider the foule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of my sinnes; it is sad and melancholy for the verie

  inferior things that are guided and gouerned by his prouidence; And by

  In all, God is altogether inuestigable; in regard of his heigth, the Heauens
  come short of him, <hi>Excelsior Coelo est</hi>; see then if thou canst reach
  vnto him. Which consideration made Saint <hi>Austen</hi> to say, That God is
  not onely present in earth, which is his footstoole, and in Heauen, which is
  his Throne; but in those which are to be immagined elsewhere. How then canst
  thou reach vnto him, beeing <pb n="107" facs="tcp:22083:60"/> more deepe than Hell, longer

  Heauen, in Hell, in the bowells of the Earth, or in the bottome of the Sea?
  Many perhaps cannot giue a full answer to this; but the Pharisees, had they not
  beene blinded with enuie, might haue contented themselues with that of
  <hi>Moses, For he hath written of me</hi>; or of <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> who did

                  <hi>He began to cast out all the Buyers and the Sellers.
  Zacharie</hi> prophecying of this entrance, saith, <hi>Ecce, Rex tuus veniet
  tibi mansuetus, Behold, thy King shall come vnto thee, meeke.</hi> How can
  these two suit together, <hi>Mansuetus,</hi> and <hi>Triumphator,</hi> gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
  and yet a Conqueror? Teares in his eyes, and yet so angrie, that hee neuer
  shewed himself more? I haue giuen some reasons hereof in another place; those
  that now offer themselues are these:</p>
               <p>The first, That Mercie and Iustice are the two Poles of Gods
  gouernment: By those teares in his eyes,<note place="margin">Mer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>e and Iustice the two Poles of Gods
 gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> and by those words of lamentation from his mouth, and by
  moouing the hearts of that hard hearted Citie, our Sauiour gaue notable proofes
  of his mercie. But finding this insufficient to make himselfe knowne amongst
  them, his Iustice then did display it's power, by whipping those Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
  and in them, the Priests who had a share in their gaines: Giuing vs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to
  vnderstand, That hee that will not bee brought to know God by his soft hand,
  and those sweete fauours of his Mercie, shall be made to know him by the whips
  and scourges of his Iustice. God prospers thy house, thou doost not
  ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it for a blessing; hee sends thee to an Hospitall laden with
  diseases, that thy miserie may teach thee to know him: He giues thee health,
  thou art not thankefull vnto him for it; hee casts thee downe on thy bed, and
  then thou giuest him thankes, not ceasing night and day to call vpon him, and
  to praise and blesse his hol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>al.</hi> 32.</note> And therefore it is truly said, <hi>The Lord
  shall bee knowne while hee worketh judgement.</hi> Our Sauioue (like a good
  Physition) tries vs first by his mild <pb n="109" facs="tcp:22083:62"/> and gentle
  medicines, but they doe no good; hee therefore turnes ouer a new leafe, and
  applies those vnto vs that are more sharpe and tart, whereby we come to know as
  well his wisedome as his loue.</p>
               <p>The second, <hi>He began to cast out the Buyers and the
  Sellers;</hi> Because no man should presume, that the glorious acclamations of
  a King, and of a Messias, should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to permit in his Temple such a foule
  and vnseemely buying and selling: they had no sooner proclaimed him King, but
  he tooke the whip into his hand, to scourge them for their offences. In a
  Prince, in a Iudge, and in a Preacher, flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries and faire words are woont to
  abate the edge of the Sword of Iustice; wherefore to shew, That true praise
  ought the more to oblige a King to vnsheath his Sword, he betooke him to his
  Whip. That acclamation and applause of the little children, our Sauiour
  accounted it as perfect and good; [<hi>Ex ore Infantium &amp; Lactantiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
  perfecisti laude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> propter Inimicos tuos.</hi>] Yet, for that a Prince, a Iudge,
  or a Preacher, should not bee carried away with the praises of men; our
  Sauiour, though applauded in the highest manner that the thought of man could
  imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, <hi>Coepit eijcere Ementes &amp; vendentes, &amp;c. Reges eos in
  virga ferrea,</hi> saith <hi>Dauid:</hi> In the name of the eternall Father,
  thou shalt (my Sonne) be their Ruler &amp; their Iudge, thou shalt beare in thy
  hand a Rod of yron, which shall not be bowed as are those other limber wands of
  your earthly Iudges: theirs are like fishing rods, which when the fish bite
  not, continue strait &amp; right, but if they nibble neuer so little at the
  bait, presently bow and bend. <hi>Esay</hi> called the Preachers of his time,
  Dumbe Dogges, not able to barke: And he presently renders the reason of this
  their dumbenesse, <hi>They knew no end of their bellie.</hi> To ear, and to
  talke, none can doe these two well and handsomely together; and because these
  Dogges haue such an hungrie appetite, that they neuer giue ouer eating, because
  nothing can fill their bellie, they are dumbe, and cannot barke, they know not
  how to open their mouths.</p>
               <p>The third is of Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> and
  <hi>Theophilact</hi>; who say,<note place="margin">Gods punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment different
 from those of Earthly Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> That it was a kind of prophecie or
  foretelling, that these legall Offerings and Sacrifices were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most now at an
  end. When Kings and Princes expresse their hatred to any great Person in Court,
  it is a prognostication of that mans fall; <hi>The wrath of a King is the
  messenger of death.</hi> Our Sauiour Christ, the Prince of the Church, had
  twice whipt out those that had prouided Beasts for the Sacrifices of his
  temple; which was an vndoubted token of their short continuance, it beeing a
  great signe of death, that one, and such a one, should come twice in this
  manner to visit them with the Rod. This conceit is much strengthened by the
  words of our Sauiour Christ,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Esay</hi> 56.</note> (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>oretold by the Prophet <hi>Esay</hi>)
  The time shall come wherein my House shall bee called a House of Prayer, and
  not a Denne of Theeues, nor a common Market of buying and selling. So that hee
  tooke these Whips in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his hands as a means to worke amendment in his
  Ministers, and to sweepe and make his House cleane. The Iudges of the earth
  (saith Saint <hi>Hierome</hi>) doe pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish a Delinquent, <hi>ad
  ruinampunc;</hi> but God, <hi>adcust gationem</hi>; the one, to his vtter
  vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing; the other, for his amendment: And therefore he vsed no other weapons
  to chastise them withall, but Rods and Whips, which worke our smart, but not
  our death; they paine vs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but they doe not kill vs. <hi>Tertullian</hi> is
  startled, and stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth much amased at that punishment which Saint
  <hi>Peter</hi> inflicted vpon <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphyra,</hi> and saith,
  That to bereaue them so suddenly of their life, &amp; to strike
  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hem in an instant dead at his
  foot, was the punish<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ent of a man,
  &amp; of one that had not long exercised, nor did well know what did belong on
  the office of a Bishop. But our Sauiour Christ being come into the world to
  giue men life, it would not <pb n="110" facs="tcp:22083:63"/> haue suited with his
  goodnesse to giue them death.</p>
               <p>The fourth reason (which all doe touch vpon) was, The disrespect
  and irreue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence which was shewne to this his Temple; a sinne which God doth
  hardly par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don: And therefore it was said vnto <hi>Ieremie, Pray not therefore
  for this People.</hi> And hee presently giues the reason why, <hi>It hath
  committed many outrages in my House.</hi> Saint <hi>Iames</hi> aduiseth, That
  the Sicke should call vnto the Priests, to get them to pray vnto God for him;
  but for him that should commit wickednes in his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, God willeth the
  Prophet <hi>Ieremie,</hi> that hee should not so much as pray for them. And
  Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, That those who shall violate the Temple of God,
  <hi>God shall destroy them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Great is the respect which God requireth to be had to his
  Temple.</p>
               <p>First, In regard of his especiall and particular presence there.
  Saint <hi>Austen</hi> saith, That <hi>Dauid</hi> did pray be fore the Arke,
  <hi>Quia ibi sacratior &amp; commendatior praesentia Domini erat.</hi> For
  euermore God manifests himselfe more in his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple than any where else; that
  place beeing like <hi>Moses</hi> his Bush, or <hi>Iacobs</hi> ladder; being
  therefore so much the more holy, by how much the more he doth there manifest
  himselfe, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He shewes himselfe there more exorable, and more
  propitious to our prayers: According to that request of <hi>Salomon</hi> in the
  dedication of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>That his eares may be there opened.</hi> And it
  was fit it should be so, as Saint <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sil</hi> hath noted it; for that,
  Prayer is a most noble act, and therefore as it requires a most noble place, so
  likewise the greater fauour appertaineth vnto it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, For that Christ is there present in his blessed
  Sacraments. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (as Saint <hi>Chrysostom</hi> hath obserued it)
  there must needs be there a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie of coelestiall Spirits; for where
  the King is, there is the Court.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, For to stirre vp our deuotion, by ioyning with the
  congregation of the Faithfull. And a learned man saith, That the Temples &amp;
  Houses of God did put a new heart and new affections into mens brests. What
  then shall become of those who refuse these publique places of praying and
  praysing of God, and make it a Den of Theeues, working all impietie and
  wickednesse in these sacred Assemblies?</p>
               <p>The last reason of our Sauiours being so angrie, was, To see the
  couetousnesse that was in his Ministers. Nothing mooues Gods patience more than
  the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse of Priests, especially when they shal make a benefit to
  their purse from the bloud of the Alter. Notable is that place of
  <hi>Balaam,</hi> when he went to curse the People of Israell, the Asse which
  carried him thither was willing to shew him his errour, God opening his mouth,
  and making his tongue to speake. And Saint <hi>Austen</hi> strucken into
  amasement at the rarenesse thereof, confesseth, Tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> he knows not what greater wonder than
  this could possibly be immagined, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> that the Prophet should not bee affrighted, hearing an Asse to
  open his mouth and reprooue him. And he renders two reasons for it: The one,
  That Sorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Witcheries were so common in those dayes; for there was not
  any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that had not it's Magicians and Sorcerers, as <hi>Trismegistus</hi>
  in Aegypt; <hi>Z<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astes</hi> in Persia; <hi>Orpheus</hi>
  in Greece; besides many Sybels in diuers other countries. The other, That he
  was blinded with that good round summe of money which he was to receiue out of
  hand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> [<hi>Habentes pretium diuinationis in manibus</hi>] king
  <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lack's</hi> Messengers had so greased his fists with good gold, that hee
  minded not that so great a miracle as the talking of his Beast. And this is a
  thing worthy the noting, That Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> and Saint <hi>Austen</hi>
  doe not onely make him a Prophet, but a holy Prophet, and that his
  couetousnesse had thus misseled him. And as <pb n="111" facs="tcp:22083:63"/> Saint
  <hi>Peter</hi> saith, Through couetousnesse shall they with feigned words make
  merchandise of you, whose iudgement lingreth not, and whose damnation
  slum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breth not; which haue forsaken the right way, and are gone astray,
  following the way of <hi>Balaam</hi> the sonne of <hi>Bozor,</hi> who loued the
  wayes of vnrighteousnes, but was rebuked for his iniquitie, the dumbe Asse
  forbidding him his madnesse, by speaking vnto him in a mans voyce.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He began to cast out all the Buyers.</hi> That one man
  should bee able to doe more than a whole Squadron, seemeth somwhat strange: but
  that none of those whom he whipt should dare to giue him so much as a word, is
  much more strange.</p>
               <p>The first reason, saith Saint <hi>Hierome,</hi> (which is also
  repeated by <hi>Thomas</hi>) was, <hi>That the Maiestie of the Deitie shined in
  his face.</hi> Whither or no, that in our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Christ that Maiestie were
  ordinarie, or whither hee had then put it on, for that it is a common custome
  with God, in those disrespects done to his temple, to discouer his greatnesse
  the more. And so when he punished <hi>Heltodorus,</hi> who would haue rob'd the
  Treasurie of the Temple, (wherein were deposited those moneys which belonged
  vnto Widdowes and Orphans) the Text saith, <hi>Spiritus omnipotentis Dei magnam
  fecit suae ostentionis euidentiam,</hi> The Lord of Spirits, and the Prince of
  all power caused a great apparition, so that all that presumed to come in with
  him were astonished at the power of God, and fainted, and were sore affraid. A
  Lyon when hee waxeth angrie sparkeleth fire forth of his eyes, and with his
  roaring makes all the beasts of the Forrest affraid, &amp; to flie from his
  anger. The Lyon of the Tribe of Iuda was angrie, his eys flamed forth fire;
  <hi>O culi eius tanquam flamma ignis,</hi> saith the <hi>Apocalyps.</hi> And
  Saint <hi>Hierome,</hi> That the beames of his wrath brake forth, &amp; that he
  roared out with a loud voyce, What make these Theeues heere in my House,
  &amp;c. Who is able to withstand him? Who can resist his rage? <hi>Seneca</hi>
  in the Tragedie of <hi>Hercules,</hi> represents him there in that mad and
  furious manner, that making towards his sonne, the verie sight of him strucke
  him dead. Whereunto suteth that which the Prophet <hi>Aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuc</hi> saith of
  God, <hi>Aspexit &amp; dissoluit Gentes, He beheld and cloue asunder the
  Nations.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Abac.</hi> 3. <hi>Iob.</hi> 25.</note> This
  force and power of Gods eye forced <hi>Iob</hi> to say, <hi>Potestas &amp;
  terror apud Deum est, Dominion and feare are with him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second is,<note place="margin">Vice euer afraid of
 Vertue.</note> That great cowardise which the face of Vertue casts on that of
  Vice; the Armies of Enemies, the sight of Deuills are not more fearefull to
  be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold. There shall not in that finall day of Iudgement be any torment equall
  to that which the Damned shall feele when they shall see the face of our
  Sauiour Christ, whom they scorned, scoffed, and reuiled. <hi>Iosephs</hi>

                  <hi>The morning is to
  them euen as the shadow of death.</hi> For this cause some Doctors for their
  greater punishment will haue the Damned that are in Hells Dungeon, lie with
  their faces vpward, looking towards Heauen. And <hi>Seneca</hi> in the Tragedie
  of <hi>Hercules</hi> saith, That when he dragg'd <hi>Cerberus</hi> out of that
  darke place, as soone as he saw the light he drew himselfe backe with that
  force, that hee had almost throwne that Conquerour to the ground. And in that
  rape of <hi>Proserpina</hi> by <hi>Pluto,</hi> it is feigned, That when his
  Coach Horses came to see the light, they striued with all their might and maine
  to returne backe againe to Hell. In like manner, those glittering beames of
  light which brake forth from the eyes of our Sauiour Christ, did dazle those of
  these Money-changers, and made them to rest as men amased.</p>

                  <hi>Iosephus</hi> reporteth, That there
  were three Sects amongst the Iewes, the <hi>Essei,</hi> the <hi>Iebusei,</hi>
  and the <hi>Saducei</hi>; and besides these, they had certaine Scribes which
  were their Sages, or the wisest men amongst them: The Greeks called them
  Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers; the Chaldaeans, <hi>Magi</hi>; the Latines, Doctors. And of
  these there were some in euerie Tribe, and in euerie Sect, &amp; in euerie
  State, as it passeth now amongst vs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Epiphanius</hi> saith, That they had two Offices.</p>
               <p>The one, To expound the Law, and to preach it to the People, who
  came euerie Sabboth to their Synagogues, as appeareth in the <hi>Acts.</hi> And
  as <hi>Iosephus</hi> and <hi>Philon</hi> hath it,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts.</hi> 9.</note> They were called <hi>Lectores,
  Readers,</hi> because they read vnto them; and Scribes, because they expounded
  the Scriptures. And <hi>Esdras</hi> termes them Scribes and Readers: And Saint
  <hi>Luke</hi> relateth, That <hi>Paul</hi> &amp; <hi>Barnabas</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to

               </p>
               <p>The second Office was, To be Iudges, <hi>He shall be deliuered
  to the Princes, and to the Scribes, and they shall condemne him to death,</hi>
  so saith Saint <hi>Mathew.</hi> And those that presented the Adulteresse to our
  Sauiour Christ, were the antientest of all the rest of the Sects; for it
  appeareth in <hi>Leuiticus,</hi> That they began with that Law that commanded
  them not to drinke wine, nor any thing that might distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per them; <hi>That yee

necessarily required a superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall vertue; the Scribes and Pharises came
vnto him, who were the grauest persons of that Commonwealth, saying, Master,
your person with those of our Religion is in great esteeme; and the wonders and
miracles that thou hast wrought amongst vs, hath woon thee a great deale of
credit and reputation: but looking well into them, wee haue found this one
fault in them, that all of them are wrought vpon ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie and common things;
as in giuing eyes to the Blind, a tongue to the Dumb, dispossessing a Deuill;
miracles done as well by others as thy selfe, as our owne Prophets beare
witnesse: and seeing thou hast got thee a greater name than they, we would
faine see thee doe greater miracles than they; as to stop the Sun in his
course, like <hi>Ioshuah</hi>; to raine downe Manna from Heauen, like
<hi>Moses</hi>; to raise whirle-winds, cloath the aire with clouds, rattle
forth thunder, and dart rayes of lightning, as God did when hee came to giue
the Law: In a word, Master, wee would haue thee to shew vs a miracle from
Heauen. Our Sauiour Christ, who to a syllable knew how to spell this their
damnable and deuilish intention, sayd vnto them, O yee accursed and adulterous
generation, Seeke yee after signes in Heauen for to discredit those that are
done on earth? Account yee these as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing? Are they illusions and impostures

  Though patience in our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Christ were a thing so naturall vnto him, yet
  may it well be wondred at, that to so many iniurious both workes and words, hee
  made so mild an answere. That Fire should burne, that Snow should coole, that
  what is heauie should tend downeward, and what is light ascend vpward; that the
  Sunne should giue light, that Heauen should glad the heart of man, that a
  Fountaine should flow, it is not much: But that the Sunne, rising for and to
  all, should denie his light to him that desires it; the Heauen, it's
  cheerefulnesse and influences; the Fountaine, water to the thirstie; and that
  our Sauiour Christ, the chiefest of Hierusalem comming vnto him, and with a
  great deale of respect crauing a signe and miracle of him, that he should make
  fooles of them, and rid them away for such, it is somewhat strange, and will
  require a <hi>Quaere,</hi> why and wherefore he did it.</p>
               <p>And this difficultie is made the greater, for that it is an
  incomparable piece of seruice, to craue and beg any thing of God. The Scripture
  stileth Prayer, A sweet perfume: And the Church calls it, <hi>Scalam
  petitionum,</hi> The Ladder where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by our Prayers ascend vnto God: And hee that
  petitions God as he ought, the more hee askes, the more God holds him his
  friend. And King <hi>Ahaz,</hi> who would not require any miracle, the Prophet
  <hi>Esay</hi> offering him Heauen, Earth, and Hell, condemned him of ill
  manners, accusing him to haue dealt therein ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie discourteously with God. How
  comes it then to passe, that the most religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and grauest kind of People
  that were in Hierusalem, comming to craue a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, our Sauiour should giue
  them this strange answer, <hi>A wicked and adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous generation seekes a

                  </note>The
  first reason is, for that they scornefully called him Master, when as they held
  him to be an Imposter, and one that was possessed with a Deuill. One of the
  greatest fauours that euer God shewed to his Church, was in giuing our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
  Christ to be it's Master; and the greatnesse of this good, hee particularly
  (amongst many other) discouered vnto vs in two effects:</p>
               <p>The one, in dispelling the darkenesse of our ignorance; For as
  the light of this materiall Sunne, doth inrich and beautifie the day,
  bannishing from vs the pitchie darkenesse of the night, to the end, that these
  our corporall eyes may behold the beautie of the World; so the light of that
  spirituall Sunne, doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich and beautifie the day of the new Law, driuing
  from vs the darkenesse of <pb n="115" facs="tcp:22083:66"/> the old Law: And therefore
  those times of the old Testament, were called by the name of Night, <hi>Nox

               </p>
               <p>The other, for that all Masters whatsoeuer in the World besides,
  doe not effectually persuade and moue the Will of man; But this Master of ours,
  doth penetrate with his words, the very innermost parts of the Soule, and the
  secret corners of the Heart; He mooues it, and persuades it by milde, yet

               </p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> sayes, That they went about to

  Magister, quid faciendo, vitam aeternam possidebo? Master, is it lawfull to
  giue tribute vnto Caesar? Master, which is the great Commandement in the Law?
  Master, What shall I doe to inherit eternall life?</hi> And that our Sauiour
  being offended, that they should flatter him with their mouths, whom they
  abhorred in their hearts (beeing like vnto those lewd women, who the lighter
  they are, the fuller of flatterie) he grew somewhat hot and angrie with
  them.</p>
               <p>But I conceiue the fault of these Scribes and Pharisees was more
  foule than so: For flatterie vsually carryeth with it a desire to please, and
  is full of courtesie, which these kind of People neuer expressed towards our
  Sauiour. And this my suspition is the more augmented by that miracle of that
  blind man, whom the Scribes (as supreame Iudges) so strictly examined; asking
  him so often, Who is he that hath healed thee? To whom he answered, My Masters,
  I haue told yee alreadie, Why are yee so importunate with me? Are ye purposed
  peraduenture to bee his Disciples? This made my Gentlemen verie angrie;
  insomuch that they said, <hi>Tu Discipulus illius sis,</hi> Wee wish thee no
  worse plague, than that thou maist be his Disciple. So that holding this a kind
  of curse and malediction, and yet to stile him with the name of Master, must be

  desiring nothing more, than by this their soothing with him, to discredit our
  Sauiour Christ; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging, That those miracles were not so sure and certaine,
  as to enforce beliefe, or to merit their vndoubted credence: And that they
  being (as it were) the Suns of that Commonwealth, whom the people did credit
  and respect next vnder God, they did labour to winne themselues credit in his

  kist his Sauiour; but out of the <pb n="117" facs="tcp:22083:67"/> verie heart and bowells
  of him, for there it was that his hatred lay. And though in other outward
  things there may be feigning and dissembling; the heart can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not loue and hate
  at once. And therefore beeing so many monstrous mis-shapes in the rest of the
  parts of mans bodie, as two heads, two hands, two feet, and the like; yet did

  them that are of a double heart,</hi> saith <hi>Salomon. Simeon</hi> and
  <hi>Leui</hi> had double hearts when they dealt so deceitfully with the Prince
  of Sichem: And because we might not think that their father had a hand in it,
  and that they did it by his aduice; at the houre of his death he called them

  against Vertue, with Vertue; against Fasting, with Fasting; against Prayer,

  worse will it seem in his sight, that the euill man should put on the disguise

  with sighes desired, that they might be so happie as to see their Sauiour, is
  now fast <pb n="118" facs="tcp:22083:68"/> asleep. The Dead liue, the Deafe heare, the
  Blind see, the Lame goe, the stones of the Temple are torne in sunder, the
  Graues open, the Sun is eclipsed, and the Moone darkened, and this great Ship
  of the World is tossed to and fro, with the furie of the winds, and yet this
  people sleepeth; and would to God they were but asleepe: for he that sleepeth,
  euerie little noyse will awaken him; but these men hauing the eyes of their
  bodie open, are as blind as any Beetle in those of their soule. They are in
  condition like vnto those Deuills of whom <hi>Iob</hi> spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, <hi>Cor eius
  indurabitur quasi lapis, &amp; extinguetur quasi malleatoris incus</hi>: He
  com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares their heart to a stone, and thinking this too short a comparison,
  (for that the hardest stone is cut and hewne with the Cheesill and Hammer) he
  compares it to a Smiths Anuile, which the more it is beaten vpon, the harder it
  growes. And Saint <hi>Gregorie</hi> hath obserued, That on the Anuile all other
  mettalls are made soft, are wrought to bee plyable, and are reduced to diuers
  formes and shapes; but the Anuile it selfe continues still harder and harder.
  In the said chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Iob</hi> saith, That the bodie of <hi>Leuiathan</hi>
  was ioyned and knit together, and that the mettall of his scales was like
  strong Shields, surely fastned together: Allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding (as it should seeme) to that
  which <hi>Ieremie</hi> speaketh of his Children, <hi>Dabis eis scutum cordis,
  &amp;c. Thou shalt giue them, ô Lord, a heart like a shield of Brasse,
  which shall rebound backe vpon thine own bosome, those shafts that thou shalt
  shoot against them</hi>: for those fauours and those blessings which thou
  bestowest vpon them, make their hearts the harder; and they are so blinded
  through their sinnes, that their hearts are become as hard as a Target of yron,
  to the end that the inspirations of thy holy Spirit may not pierce them
  through. And if they that are hard de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue to be hardly dealt withall, it is
  not amisse, that our Sauiour should say vnto them, <hi>Generatio mala &amp;

  that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer or future Ages haue seene, or shall see, was that which the Iewes

  and that it was left to their choyce, and that the power was now in their

  owne will, but the will of him that sent me.</hi> O sweet Iesu! Thy will
  conforming it selfe to the will of thy Father, Why shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest thou bee affraid?
  It was to teach thee, That if our Sauiour Christ stood in feare of his owne
  will,<note place="margin">Not more pernicious to himselfe.</note> (it being
  impossible for him to will more than what stood with his Fathers will) thou,
  that doost not conforme thy selfe according to the will of God, it is not much,
  that thou shouldst be affraid thereof. <hi>Seneca</hi> saith in one of his

  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:22083:68"/> that he wil fulfil our wil, &amp; our seeking after that
  good, from which we ought to flie. Hence it commeth to passe, That our owne
  will is the Leuen of our owne hurt; as also of Gods wrath and displeasure
  towards vs. And <hi>Thomas</hi> renders the reason thereof; for, <hi>Voluntas
  in homine est Regina potentiarum h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>manarum, Mans Will is the Queene of humane faculties</hi>: To whose
  charge is committed the treating and obtaining of our desired ends; and is so
  absolute a Soueraigne, that although the Vnderstanding be in it selfe so noble,
  as nothing more; it speaketh vnto it by memorialls, and representing thereunto
  the reason of that which shee propoundeth vnto it, in the end she comes to
  follow her owne liking. And for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as Diuine Will is that vniuersall
  Empresse, against whom none ought to display their Banner; she finds her selfe
  especially offended, and counts it a kind of high treason, that humane Will
  should rebel against her, there being no other Wil neither in heauen, nor in
  earth, more than the Wil of God: And this Lesson we are taught in our <hi>Pater
  noster, Thy Kingdome come; thy Will be done in earth, as it is in heauen.</hi>
  The earth is thy Kingdome, as well as the heauen; and therefore, thy Will be
  done in earth, as it is in heauen. Now the Scribes and Pharisees grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into
  competition with the Will of God, saying <hi>Volumus</hi>; it is no meruaile,
  that our Sauiour should say vnto them, <hi>Generatio mala &amp; adultera,
  &amp;c. Gregorie Nissen</hi> saith, That as we are all wounded in Paradice, by
  our Father <hi>Adam</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by that sore poyson of Disobedience, and by the
  sword of our owne Selfe-will; so are we all healed by our obedience to the Will
  of God, which is the graue &amp; sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre (as <hi>Climachus</hi> hath it) of
  our proper Will; and this we dayly craue in these words, <hi>Thy Will be
  done.</hi> And <hi>Petrus Chrysologus</hi> doth bewaile the wretched estate of
  this World, for it's fulnesse of Selfe-loue.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We would see a signe from thee.</hi> What? Were not those
  miracles sufficient which our Sauiour had done alreadie? They might haue
  satisfied the Vnderstanding, but they could not satisfie the Will. S.
  <hi>Iohn</hi> was the Light,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.</note> and many
  were chee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with it, [<hi>Exultauerunt in luce eius;</hi>] but the Will stood
  not affected there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto. And <hi>Deutronomie</hi> saith,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Deut.</hi> 21. Nothing more profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Man, than the
 o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying of Gods Will.</note> That God wrought great signes and wonders in
  Aegypt, but the Children of Israell had not a heart to vnderstand them, <hi>Et
  non dedit vobis cor intelligens.</hi> Which is all one with that which
  <hi>Dauid</hi> deliuereth in somewhat darker words, <hi>V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>x Domini intercidentis flammam ignis.</hi> For God is
  woont in the fire, to diuide the light from the flame, giuing light to the
  Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, but not fire to the Will. That therefore now a dayes in the
  Church there should be so many Sermons, so many Preachers, so much Light, and
  so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Fruit thereof; the reason of it is, That the Vnderstanding is
  informed, but the Wil is not conformed; the former being contented, but the
  latter not conuinced. The Deuill did endeauour, that our Sauiour Christ should
  doe a miracle <hi>sine fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctu,</hi> to no good in the World, when he lay at
  him to turne the stones into bread; which might haue amased his Vnderstanding,
  but not haue abated his Will. And the Scribes and Pharisees, like the Sonnes of
  such a Father, taking this their Selfe-will from their Sire, place therein
  their chiefest foelicitie. <hi>Gregorie Nissen</hi> saith, That when that
  lasciuious Ladie tooke hold of <hi>Iosephs</hi> cloake, and kept it still in
  her hands, and would not let it goe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a man would haue thought, that hee
  might haue escaped from her to his lesse cost: But the Deuill, who had put that
  Will into her, had likewise put to his helping hand, in making her take hold on
  his cloake: And against two Deuills, one incarnate, and another spiritual, What
  can a holy young man doe lesse, than leaue his cloake behind him?</p>
               <p>From whence I inferre a conclusion of no small consequence, That
  one of the greatest things that God had to doe in the World, was to
  affectionate our <pb n="120" facs="tcp:22083:69"/> Will. All the actions of our Sauiours
  life and death had two intents: The one, To redeeme vs from the seruitude and
  slauerie of the Deuill: The other, To in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse loue into our hearts; <hi>I came
  to set fire on the earth, and what remaines but that it burne?</hi> With this
  double charge of his, which cost him no lesse than his life, and the shedding
  of his most pretious bloud, he left a free entrance for vs to get into Heauen.
  And if any man shall aske me, Which was the greater cost of the two? I answer,
  That our Sauiour found greater difficultie in affectionating vs for Heauen,
  than in purchasing Heauen for vs, or in conquering the Deuill and Hel: For one
  onely drop of his bloud was sufficient to do this; but for to affectionate our
  will, all his bloud in his bodie would scarce suffice. And therefore Saint
  <hi>Cyprian</hi> saith, That he was willing to suffer so much, though he might,
  and that in rigour, haue satisfied with so little. For, though a little might
  haue serued the turne, for to worke our redemption; yet a little was not enough
  for to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame our hearts with the fire of his loue. This sence may suit with
  that saying of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> so diuersly commented, <hi>Gaudeo in
  passionibus meis, &amp; adimpleo quae desunt passionum Christi in carne
  mea.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>I reioyce in my
  sufferings for you, and fulfill the rest of the afflictions of Christ, in my
  Flesh.</hi> Why should the Apostle say so? For what can be wanting to those
  passions of Christ, which were so aboundant and all sufficient? Marry, That wee
  might make true benefit thereof, and that hee might infuse this affection into
  our hearts, the Apostle saith, I desire to be dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and to be with
  Christ.</p>

  which haue a continual conflict within themselues; or, to speake more properly,
  they are a Chancerie consisting of Iudges, guiltie persons, and Pleaders,
  <hi>Inuicem se accusantium, &amp; defendentium,</hi> (as Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
  tels vs) <hi>Accusing and excusing one another</hi>:<note place="margin">

  guiltie person, and the Pleader is that Worme which accuseth and gnaweth their
  conscience. And when the guiltie person seeth that the Pleader accuseth him,
  and that the Iudge condemnes him, though miracles doe abound, yet hee appealeth
  to some other miracle; like vnto a bad debtour, who when his time of payment is
  come, craues a longer day. One findes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe at Death's doore, and sees that
  he is like to die, and that in all likelihood he is to goe to Hell, for that
  his ill gotten wealth condemnes him; hee weeps, cries out, makes grieuous
  lamentation, purposeth, promiseth, and resolueth to amend his life, and to make
  restitution: God heares him, giues him life and health; and when he sees that
  he is sound &amp; well, and that his Pleader presseth him to make restitution,
  he appeales to another miracle. Another findes, that he hath slipt a thousand
  times, vpon this or that occasion; he knowes his owne weakenesse, and that he
  cannot looke, but he must lust; and purposing without any ill intention in the
  world, to entertaine honest conuersation with this and that woman, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes
  too day like the Swine, againe to his mire; and too morrow appeales to another
  miracle. Saint <hi>Austen</hi> reports in his <hi>Confessions,</hi> That hee
  had a great conflict within himselfe; his Will had a purpose to leaue these
  human delights and pastimes; and when the day of his purpose and promise was
  come, this Pleader puts him in mind of it, but he appeales to another day. This
  then was a great part of this peoples fault, that they did complaine, That God
  did not deale so kindly with them as he was woont, <hi>We haue not seene our
  signes, there is now no Prophet.</hi> The greatest of all the Prophets that
  euer were, or shall bee, came amongst them, and did more miracles than all of
  them put together; and when they should haue confest themselues to haue beene
  conuicted with so many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, they appeale to another miracle. The Pharisee
  which inuited our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, tooke him to be no Prophet, because he did not diue
  into the depth of that loathsome and sinnefull brest of <hi>Marie
  Magdalen:</hi> If (thought he) hee were a Prophet, hee could not chuse but know
  what kind of woman this was. But fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding afterwards, that he knew

  And in our Creed we confesse, <hi>Prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter nos, &amp; propter nostram salutem,

  a condition and qualitie so notorious of those which were prophecied and
  foretold of the Messias, that to haue them to come from Heauen, was a thing
  vnknowne to the learned Doctors of those times. Thou sendest thy seruant on an
  errand, and saist vnto him, In such a walke thou shalt meet with a man clad in
  greene, wearing a hat with a feather in it of such and such colours, &amp;c.
  Now if he should so farre mistake himselfe, as to goe to one that were cloathed

               <p>And therefore God, one while as the Authour of Nature, another

  a signe; and the Pharisees did worse, in demanding one from Heauen; the one
  offended in the lesse, the other, in the more; the one was too backeward, the
  other, too forward. For God hauing descended downe from Heauen in his owne
  person, they could not, than this, desire a greater miracle. But they were the
  sonnes of those fathers, who enioying the bread of Angells, were quickely
  wearie of it, and long'd for Quailes; insomuch that God was forced to take away
  their liues from them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he knew not how to satisfie their longings.</p>
               <p>The second qualitie and propertie of our Sauiours miracles
  was,<note n="(2.)" place="margin">They are done imparitiuely and with a kind of

  ioyning this his Empire with his doctrine, they did cleerely prooue, that he
  was God, as it is noted by <hi>Thomas.</hi> Saint <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome</hi> brings
  in here a comparison which makes much to the purpose that wee haue in hand:
  Thou entrest (saith he) into a Pallace, thou knowest not the Prince or Lord
  thereof; thou espiest one, before whom all the rest stand bare, and rising vp
  from their seats, obey whatsoeuer hee commandeth: Now when thou seest this,
  thou canst not be so simple, but thou must needs know that this is their king
  and chiefe commander. In the Iewes it was not much, that they should doubt
  whither our Sauior Christ were Lord of heauen &amp; earth, or no; but when they
  saw that the Winds did obey him, the Waues, the Dead, the Liuing, Heauen, and
  Earth, and that he did command all creatures with that supreame power and
  Empire, they might then verie well haue fallen into this reckoning, as to say,
  This is the Lord of all. The Centurions, though they had no learning, yet did
  they light vpon this truth, <hi>Verè Filius Dei erat iste, This was
  truly the Sonne of God.</hi> The one of them led thereunto, when he saw in what
  a strange manner the whole world was troubled: The other, when in good manners,
  with a <hi>Domine, Noli vexari, Lord, Trouble not thy selfe,</hi> he seemed
  loath to giue our Sauiour that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; saying vnto him, I am but a poore
  Captaine, an ordinarie Commander, and yet when I lay my commandment vpon my
  seruants, they obey me; much more reason then is it, that sickenesse should be
  subiect to thy Empire, &amp;c. And if the inuisible things of God are
  manifested by the visible, [<hi>Sempiterna quoque virtus &amp; diuinitas</hi>]
  and that they which may know him by them, will not glorifie him in them, they
  shall remaine inexcusable. This was the Scribes and Pharisees case, who saw so
  many miracles with their owne eyes, &amp;c.</p>

  to entertaine themselues. A royall Merchant wil vnpacke all his wares, &amp;

  <hi>Herod</hi> did expect <hi>Videre signum ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quod ab eo fieri, To see some
  signe wrought by him.</hi> And though our Sauiour might haue freed himselfe by
  any one miracle whatsoeuer, from a thousand calumnies and affronts; yet would
  he not bestow so much as a few words vpon him, for he knew it would haue beene
  but a casting of Pearles amongst Swine.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Kings</hi>
 6.</note> The Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stines did much desire to know, whither or no the God of
  Israell were the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of their miseries; and by the aduice and councell of
  their Soothsayers, they made a new Cart, and taking two milch Kyne, on whom
  there had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer come any yoke, tying the Kyne to the Cart, and setting the
  Arke of the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament thereupon, they said, If they go fore-right, vp by the
  way of it's owne coast, to Bethshemish, it is he that did vs this great euill;
  but if not, and that they shall turne backe their heads at the lowing of their
  Calfes, wee shall know then that it was not his hand that smote vs, but it was
  a chance that hapned vnto vs. The Gouernours of the Philistines followed after
  them, they beheld with their owne eyes all the signes and tokens that they
  could desire; they were asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished thereat, yet for all this did they not
  forsake their Dagon; for they desired those signes more to see, than to
  beleeue. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> preaching in Athens, of our Sauiors Death and
  Resurrection; those that were the best Disputants in their Schooles, and the
  curiousest Schollers amongst them, came vnto him and told him, Wee much desire
  to heare and know this new Doctrine which thou prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chest:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts</hi> 17.</note> And it is noted in the Text, That <hi>Ad
  nihil aliud vacabant, nisi aut dicere, aut audire aliquid noui, That they gaue
  themselues to nothing else, but either to tell or to heare some newes</hi>;
  desiring (as it should seeme) to heare and know them, but not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue them.
  Of this stampe are those who onely come to Sermons for curiosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie;<note place="margin">Curious hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers reproued.</note> some gaping for sharpe and
  wittie conceits; others, for elegancie of words; others, for the flower and
  creame (as it were) of the Scripture phrase, and it's prettie allusions and
  allegories; this is that which their eares itch after; nothing will down with
  them but quelques-choses, made dishes, and pleasing sauces for the Palate,
  refusing that wholesome food of Gods Word, and those substantiall morcells of
  sound Doctrine, which should feed their soules to euerlasting life. <hi>A
  veritate quidem auditum auertent.</hi> Saint <hi>Austen</hi> makes a comparison
  of a golden Key which opens ill, and of one of wood which opens well: Now to
  him that hath no other pretension but to open, it were meere follie in him, to
  seeke after the golden one, when that of wood will doe it better. And in
  another place, saith this sacred Doctor, That as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> commanded the
  male children of Gods People to be killed, but spared the females, that he
  might thereby weaken them, and bring them vnder; so those Preachers which
  bestow all their paines in the neat dressing of words,<note place="margin">Sermons should be seasoned more with Salt, than Sugar.</note>
  ornaments of wit, and fluentnesse of stile, (not regarding strong arguments,
  and sound reasons) doe weaken the force of the truth, and bring their Doctrine
  at last into contempt. Salt in a Preacher is more necessary than Sugar; that
  which shall season our Soules, rather than that which shal swee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten our
  Palates; that which shall strike home to our hearts, than that which shall
  onely tickle our eares. And in another place, where he that treateth onely
  ofcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riositie in Doctrine, he auowes him to be in danger of loosing the Faith;
  because Curiositie is the Mother of Heresie. And likewise in another place hee
  saith, That that the curious man is like the scripulous man; and that the
  Accessorie is the Principall, and the Principall the Accessorie; <hi>Curiosus
  ea requiret, quae nihil <pb n="125" facs="tcp:22083:71"/> ad se pertinet,</hi> They afflict
  themselues with that which importeth them least. And if those that are
  scrupulous &amp; ful of doubts are condemned for fooles, of force it must
  follow, that those that are curious inquirers must weare the same Liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.

  God would haue beene but pleased to haue shewed me some one miracle, or other;
  This is but a requiring of new signes, and a condemning of those which they

  Faith; and Faith, Beleefe; [<hi>Oportet discentem credere, He that learneth

  This is that light, wherewith in the beginning of the world God did dispell the

  though hee shall come in the forme of a seruant, yet he shall bee the true God.
  And therefore hee concludes that Chapter with this saying: <hi>Quiescite ergo

  beloued) that I admonish you, and require you, that when these prophesies shall

  Historie of <hi>Ionas</hi> shall be alledged against him: but as the Whale
  swallowed <hi>Ionas,</hi> but sent him forth again without any harm done vnto
  him; so our Sauiour Christ was swallowed vp by the Earth, but not to his hurt:
  and both it and all the Elements acknowledged him to be their Lord and Master;
  which was more than the Pharisees would doe.</p>
               <p>To Saint <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> this threatning seemeth to be an
  effect of mercie. For, by proposing vnto them the example of Niniuie, he
  desires to draw them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. It was another kind of threatning that God
  vsed towards his people, for worshipping the golden Calfe; <hi>Let me goe, that
  I may destroy them, and blot out their name. Theodoret</hi> is of opinion, That
  this was Gods great mercie towards them: For by that threatning, he set before
  <hi>Moses</hi> the wickednesse of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and did thereby aduise him, that
  he should make intercession for them, that he might not punish them in his
  wrath. After that generall deluge and inundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of waters which drowned the
  whole world, God did set a bow in heauen, and it may be he might haue tooke it
  in his hand, for to threaten the Earth; But Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> hath noted,
  That to the end that the World should take it as a token of Gods mercie towards
  them, he made the points or ends of it to touch the earth, that the World might
  thereby be assured,<note place="margin">

  saith, That so great is the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of God, that though hee might with a
  great deale of reason denie vs his mercie, he doth not only not deny it vs, but
  he threatneth vs, and also intreateth for vs, to the end that we may accept of
  this his mercie: for no father can be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magined to be halfe so pittifull as he
  is. Saint <hi>Austen</hi> crieth out, O Lord, what am I, that thou shouldst
  command me to loue thee? What am I, that thou shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest be offended with me?
  And, Why doost thou threaten me with great mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, if I doe not loue thee? I
  am much bound vnto thee for the one, but more for the other: In louing thee, I
  see how much I get by it; in threatning mee, I see how much reckoning thou
  makest of me. S. <hi>Ephrem</hi> discoursing of those of Niniuie, saith, That

  going to the Hauen at Tharsis, to take his journie towards Niniuie: as also,
  that the Prophet to whom God speaketh,<note place="margin">Reasons mouing Ionas

  God commaunds him, that if hee should withhold the reuelation which God hath

  which <hi>Iob</hi> speaketh of himselfe, My bellie is like the wine which

               <p>
                  <hi>Ionas rose vp that he might flie.</hi> More plaine is that
  opinion of Saint <hi>Hierome, Nazianzen, Theodoret, Theophilact,</hi> and
  <hi>Methodius</hi> the Martyr, That <hi>Ionas</hi> was not so hastie as here
  before we haue made him; but that he pretended nothing lesse, but sought by all
  meanes possible, how he might auoyd this journey, and closely conueis his bodie
  (as it were) from this command of God, by shaping his course another way.
  Whither it were of dislike, that God should passe ouer his fauors to the
  Gentiles, and that his owne Countrie should remaine disgraced and rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; and
  albeit he happely knew this was to come to passe hereafter: yet hee 
  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:22083:76"/> would not willingly haue seene it so to succeed in his
  time: or whither it were in point of honour in his owne person, thinking (if
  not foreknowing) that God being so mercifull, that he would pardon the
  Niniuites vpon their first teares, he should then suffer in his reputation, and
  should be taken for a braine-sicke foole, and that he had exceeded his
  Commission, and so be mocked and laughed at for his labour.</p>
               <p>So that in the end he was fully resolued not to vndergoe the
  Embassage that was enioyned him; and therefore embarking himselfe, hee thought
  hee might then goe whither he wolud through the world. This is Saint
  <hi>Hieromes</hi> opinion, which the <hi>Chaldees Paraphrase</hi> doe likewise

  shall I flie from thy face? if I climbe vp into Heauen, thou art there; if I
  goe into Hell, thou art likewise there.</hi> I answer, That hee had no such
  kind of conceit in the world, nor any so foule a thought once entered into his
  immagination: But that which he presumed vpon, was, That in the land of the
  Gentiles, God would not reueale himselfe, nor communicate the Spirit of
  Prophecie to his Prophets; and therefore hee was minded to alter his former
  condition of life, and turne Merchant: For Tharsis was so famous a Port, in

  seeing,<note place="margin">The Deuills tyranny ouer his followers.</note> that a
  Prophet was not accepted of in his owne Countrie, would needs turne
  Merchant.</p>
               <p>He got him into a Ship of the Phoenicians, to flie into
  Tharshish from the presence of the Lord; <hi>Et dedit illis naulum, And he paid
  the fare thereof, and went downe into it.</hi> For the Deuill is not contented
  that a sinner should doe him ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice onely, but that he should giue him money
  also into the bargaine; which is a strange kind of tyrannie.</p>
               <p>The Shippe had scarce beene a while vnder saile, when as a
  fearefull Tempest arose, which put those that were in the Shippe into extreame
  perill of their life. And albeit your Pilots, your Mariners, and Shippe-boyes,
  that are beaten and accustomed to these kind of chances, vsually loose all
  feare both of windes and waues, nay also of God himselfe; yet now, such was the
  tempestuousnesse of the weather, &amp; the raging of the Sea, that they called
  vpon those their gods which were painted in their Ship; <hi>Timuerunt nautae,
  The Mariners feare encreased,</hi> iudging this Storme the strangest as euer
  they saw, accounting it as a miracle.</p>
               <p>First of all, Because there was no preceding signe of it; for
  those that are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced Seafaring men, are not onely skilled in knowing
  those signes of a <pb n="135" facs="tcp:22083:76"/> storme that are neere at hand, but
  those that are afarre off; as by the irruptions of the aire, which breaking
  forth from the concauities and hollow vaults of the Deepe, trouble the waters;
  the colluctation and wrestling of the winds, the cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Rauens, the
  bellowing of Beasts, the playing of Porpeecies, which doe whisper in their
  eares the storme that is to come vpon them. But this Tempest here came so
  violently vpon them on the sudden, that there was no foregoing signe to
  foreshew it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Because (as <hi>Rabbi Salomon</hi> hath noted it, an
  Hebrew Doctor, from whom <hi>Theodoret</hi> and <hi>Theophilact</hi> had it)
  there were many ships that had gone out of Tharshish, which they might kenne
  not farre from them, that had verie faire and cleere weather, and sailed away
  smoothly, hauing (as they say) a Ladies pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, so calme was the Sea, and so
  gentle and temperate their gale of wind. Whereupon they did discreetly argue
  amongst themselues, that there was some great and notorious sinner in their
  Ship, against whom the windes and the waues (by Gods especiall appointment)
  made such cruell warre. He that goes to sea, goes in danger, <hi>Qui nauigant
  mare, &amp;c. Euripides</hi> was of opinion, That they could not be truly said
  to bee either dead or aliue; not dead, because they liue; not aliue, because
  there was only a poore planke betwixt their death and their life. And the
  Sinner haleth his halter after him, and if God did not defend him, the Sea
  would not endure him. The Slaue that flies from his Master, all the seruants of
  the house make hue and crie after him; they follow him, crying, Stop him, stop
  him: and if that will not serue the turne, his Master sends Horsemen after him,
  who pursue him, and apprehend him. All the whole house of Heauen make hue and
  crie after <hi>Ionas,</hi> Angells, Saints, Friends, holy inspirations, make
  pursuit after him, as they vse to doe after other rebellious sinners: But that
  will not serue the turn; whereupon he sends these his Horsmen after him, the
  winds, the waues, the ship-boyes, and mariners; they take him and cast him into
  the dungeon of the Whales bellie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Miserunt vasa, They cast forth their Vessels, &amp;c.</hi>
  This word <hi>Vasa</hi> is taken for the wares, the weapons, the Masts, the
  sailes, and other instruments belonging to a Ship; <hi>Vasa Domus, Vasa
  Bellica, Vasa Nauis,</hi> and the like. In that Tempest which Saint
  <hi>Luke</hi> mentioneth in the <hi>Acts of the Apostles,</hi> wherein Saint
  <hi>Paul</hi> suffered so many dayes, he saith,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts</hi>
 17.</note> That the verie cords and tacklings in the ship were cast ouer boord,
  <hi>Armamenta Nauis proiecerunt</hi>: So now, whither it were to lighten the
  Ship, or to appease the anger of their Gods, whom they thought were to be
  appeased with gifts, or that they were subiect to these passions of choller and
  couetousnesse, &amp;c. And as now the Faithfull haue recourse in their
  shipwracks to prayers and promises; so was it now with these Infidels, and not
  to this alone, but to the offering vp of Iewells of great price and value.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ionas</hi> was got him down into the bottome of the Ship;
  whither he had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawne himselfe thither out of his sorrow, or to auoid the
  noyse of their shreeks and out-cries, or for feare of the thunder &amp;
  lightning, or not to behold the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and rage of the waues and the winds, I

  are affraid, and the Fishes retyre themselues into their holes in the deepe,
  and doost thou sleep? Arise for shame, and call vpon thy God, since others call
  vpon theirs. Whither it were that they did presume that <hi>Ionas</hi> was some

  The sea wrought exceeding high, and was troublous against them.</hi> Thereupon,
  they made a deuout prayer vnto God, entreating him that he would not impute
  vnto them the death of that Prophet: O Lord, (sayd they) thou hast made our

  should throw him into the Sea, thou mightest, if thou wouldst, haue giuen him
  some other kind of death: This iudgement which we execute vpon him, we haue

  ceased from her raging, resting satisfied with this Sacrifice, and giuing it as
  a sure signe and token vnto them, that it did not pretend this it's furie, to
  any but <hi>Ionas.</hi> The Mariners after they had cast him into the Sea,
  sought (as an antient Doctor saith) to take him vp againe, and to saue his
  life; but then the waues began to rise and rage afresh, insomuch that they were
  forced to let him alone: it being a wonder, to see Seafaring men, who are

  God maintaines and preserues his life. If the stomacke of a Whale will digest
  an anchor of Yron, (as <hi>Tertullian</hi> tells vs) it must then of force
  consume <hi>Ionas</hi>; and if instead of aire, he drawes in water, he must
  necessarily be choaked. But he that deliuered <hi>Daniel</hi> from the hungrie
  mouths of Lyons, and those three children from the flames of the firie Furnace;
  it is not much, that hee should conserue <hi>Ionas</hi> in the deepest and
  darkest dungeon that euer liuing man was clapt vp in. The wonder was, that
  though himself were prisoner, yet he had left vnto him so free an
  vnderstanding, that hee was able to make so elegant an oration to God, out of
  so foule a Pulpit.</p>
               <p>The Prophet did dwell vpon this great miracle which God had vsed
  towards him, and did recouer so much strength and confidence, that he stucke
  not to say, <hi>Rursus videbo templum sanctum tuum, Yet will I looke againe

  freed out of this loathsome Gaole, but to humble my selfe on my knee in thy

  hast shewed towards me: For the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent I will make this sluttish corner my

  vnto thee; who, like some great Prince or Monarch of the world, is respected in

  without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Miracles, laying their beleefe vpon the Prophet, they
  presently gaue beginning to that their great repentance, which was the
  strangest that euer was yet heard of.</p>
               <p>The King layd aside his purple roabes, and his rich and costly

  causing his clothes of State to bee pulled downe, his walls of his pallace to
  be left naked of their hangings of cloth of Gold, and other pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Arras,
  beeing no lesse curious than glorious. For <hi>Sardanapalus,</hi> was one of
  the loosest, and most licentious men, that hee had not his like in all the
  World. The like did all the great Officers of his Pallace, the Princes, and
  Wealthyest men of his Citie, as also all the faire and beautifull Ladies. And
  there was a Proclamation presently made through all Niniuie, (by the Councell
  of the King, and his Nobles) with expresse charge, That neither man, nor beast,
  bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locke, nor sheep, should tast any thing, neither feed, nor drinke water;
  but that man and beast should put on sack-cloth, and cry mightily vnto God. To
  the end, that the bellowing of their bulls, the bleating of their sheepe &amp;
  goats, the how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of their dogs, the teares of their children, the sighes
  &amp; lamentations of their mothers, might mooue Heauen to take pitie of them.
  And aboue all, they did cry out most grieuously for their sinnes. For albeit,
  they are offences towards God, yet are they miseries vnto man; and as,
  <hi>quatenus peccata, so farre foorth as they are sinnes,</hi> they prouoke and
  stirre vp Gods Iustice against vs; So, <hi>qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenus,</hi> they are

  was too strict a commaund, to inioyne this punishment vpon dumbe beasts, and
  poore little infants, that had not yet offended. But first of all, they did
  therein pretend to incline Gods mercy towards them. Secondly, to mooue the more
  repentance, by a common sorrow. Thirdly, as at the funeralls of Princes, and
  Generals, not onely the principall and meaner persons mourne in blackes, but
  their horses weare the like liuery of sorrow, their drummes beat hoarse,
  couered with blacke Cypres, their auncients are trailed along on the ground,

               <p>
                  <hi>Ionas</hi> put Niniuie to such a strict penance, and sorrow
  for their sinnes, that it did appease the wrath of God towards them. The
  Prophet presumed it should be destroyed; and therefore <hi>Ionas</hi> went out
  of the Citie, and sate on the East side thereof, and there made him a booth,
  and sate vnder it in the shadow, till he might see what should bee done in the

  the Citie all at once, but that he would destroy a great part thereof; as he
  did in the adoration of the golden Calfe, when as pardoning the people, hee
  slew a great number of them. Now God had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared a Gourd for <hi>Ionas,</hi>

  the strangenesse of it was, that it grew vp all in a day. The Prophet was
  exceeding glad to see himselfe so wel sheltred by this Gourd, from the heat of
  the Sunne, which did shrewdly scortch him; <hi>Laborauerat enim, It vexed him
  verie sore:</hi> So that before it went verie ill with him; and his ioy was so
  much the more encreased, for that he saw God had such a care to cherish and
  make much of him; Sure (thought he) he makes no small account of me, that vseth
  me thus kindly. But God shortly after prepared a worme, which smote the Gourd
  that it withered; <hi>Et percussit Sol super caput Iona, &amp; astuabat, The
  Sunne beat vpon the head of</hi> Ionas, <hi>and he fainted.</hi> Who could haue
  the patience to endure this? Was it the Sun, or was it fire, that should thus

  not pittie Niniuie, whom thou hast drawne by thy preaching vnto them, to
  repentance? Niniuie yeelded vnto thee at the first words of thy voyce; but Iuda
  still stands out obstinately in her malice against my calling vpon her. And

  this lesson, he saith, <hi>Ecce, plus quam</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon <hi>hîc, Behold,
  a greater than Salomon is here.</hi> He was greater than <hi>Ionas</hi>; for if
  he were obeyed by the Niniuites, our Sauiour had obeysance done him by all the
  Elements: if <hi>Ionas</hi> had a grace in his deliuerie, and spake with a
  spirit, it was our Sauiour that gaue it him: if <hi>Ionas</hi> did inlighten a
  Citie, our Sauiour did illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate the whole world: if <hi>Ionas</hi> did
  preach bloud; threatnings, and death, our Sauiour did publish our saluation,
  life, and hope of Heauen. He was better than <hi>Salomon</hi>; for his wisedome
  was humane and earthly; but that of our Sauiour, diuine and heauenly:
  <hi>Salomon</hi> neuer wrought any miracles; but those of our Sauiour were
  without number. In a word, betweene the Queene of the South and the Pharisees,
  betweene our Sauiour and <hi>Salomon,</hi> there is a great antithesis and
  contrarietie: The Queene was a Barbarian, and ignorant; they, Doctours, and
  learned in the Lawes; she, wonderfull desirous to heare a man; they, loath to
  heare a God; she offered to <hi>Salomon</hi> great gifts; they to our Sauiour
  vinegar and gall; shee did so wonder at <hi>Salomons</hi> wisedome, that she
  said, Fame had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied him, and that Report came too short of his praise; but
  they made so slight account of our Sauiours words and workes, that they require
  new miracles at his hands: but this their cauelling with him, shal occasion
  their condemnation. To conclude, The principal things that Niniuie shal charge
  them with, are two.</p>
               <p>The first, The speedinesse of their repentance, and the hast
  that they made to turne vnto God: For (as Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> hath noted
  it) in three dayes <hi>Ionas</hi> ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected that in Niniuie,<note place="margin">Ionas effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more in three dayes then our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour did in
 thirty yeares. Repentance, not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred.</note> which our Sauiour could
  not bring to passe in thirty yeres and vpward. Saint <hi>Ambrose,</hi> That
  they who deferre their repentance till the houre of their death, ought not to
  bee denied the Sacraments, if they desire them; but I dare not be so bold
  (saith the said Father) to warrant them their sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. <hi>Rahab</hi> had
  scarce put the Spies out of her window, but that she present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hung out that
  coloured string, the token that was giuen her for the safeguard of her life.
  <hi>Philon</hi> takes into consideration, that exceeding great hast which the
  Aegyptians made to rid their Countrie of the children of Israell; they held it
  no wisedome, to deferre their departure one minute of an houre longer, (if they
  could so soone haue freed themselues from them) considering in what great
  dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger they were of loosing their liues. Much lesse discretion is it, to defer
  the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance of our sinnes from day to day, considering how dayly we are in
  perill of perishing in Hell.</p>
               <p>The second, The greatnesse, sharpenesse, and rigour of their
  Repentance, not onely in the men, but in the women, children, and cattell: They
  thought with themselues, That fortie dayes of sorow were too little, and too
  few for so many yeares of sinning; and therefore they did striue all that they
  could, that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie of their punishment might make amends for that long
  time wherin they had offended. <hi>Lanabo per singulas noctes lectum meum,</hi>
  i. <hi>I will euerie night wash my Couch with my tears. Chrys.</hi> saith,
  <hi>Culpa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fuisse vnius noctis, lachrimas multorum, That it was but one nights
  sinne, but many nights teares. Amplius laua me, O Lord, wash me yet a little

                  </gap>r, one rinsing, one
  bucking is not sufficient, no, though we haue neuer so much sope and ashes to
  scoure them cleane, and bear out our hearts vpon the blocke of our sencelesse
  soules: it must (ô Lord) be the water of that immense and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie sea of

  in a perfect age, and sound in his judgement, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, for his recreation giuen
  him Paradise, and for his authoritie, the Seignio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the World; yet did hee
  not giue him thankes for these his so great and many fauours towards him;
  whereupon the Deuill, (beeing a slye and subtill Merchant) tooke occasion to
  tempt him, persuading himselfe, That hee who had shewed himselfe ingratefull,
  would with a little labour bee easily brought to be disobedient. This Doctor
  doth soundly &amp; throughly ponder these words, <hi>Serpens erat callidior,
  The serpent was more subtill.</hi> Like a craftie Huntsman, hee waited but for
  a time, that <hi>Adam</hi> by his vnthankefulnes should fall into the toile,
  whence afterwards hee should not so easily get out. Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi>
  sayth, That <pb n="144" facs="tcp:22083:82"/> 
                  <hi>Noah,</hi> all that while that hee was
  building the Arke, did not any thing, though neuer so little, without some
  especiall order from God; but as soone as hee was gone out of the Arke, without
  further expecting aduise from Heauen, hee did prepare and make readie his
  sacrifice. For, that a Soule should shew it selfe thankefull to it's God, it is
  not necessary, that it should stay waighting &amp; looking for reuelations; but
  rather hasten to expresse it as soone as it can, and to vse all preuention of
  being put in mind of it. And therfore in approbation of <hi>Noahs</hi>
  for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnesse, the Text sayth, <hi>Odoratus est Dominus odorem suauitatis, The

               <p>There is another circumstance, touching Ingratitude, which is

  downe for him. But hee that shall blaspheme the name of the Lord, <hi>Morte

  (questionlesse) is a lesser sinne than the former; And yet God dissembles the
  for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and will by no meanes indure the second. And the reason thereof
  (rendred by <hi>Thomas</hi>) is, That those names, and attributes of God, doe
  shut vp as it were, and comprehend in them those benefits which hee so
  liberally bestowes vpon vs; and for that the blasphemer showes himselfe so
  vngratefull vnto God, hee cannot hope for any pardon of his punishment. Our
  Sauiour Christ then seeing, that Iudea did draw poyson out of treacle, and
  vnthankefulnesse and hardnesse of heart, from the many fauours and mercies that
  hee had shewed towards them, <hi>Secessit in partes Tyri &amp; Sydonis, Went

  Desine, vt irascatur furor meus,</hi> Stand not betwixt mee and home, that I
  may destroy this people. O Lord, who can hold thy hand, when thou art willing
  to strike? Who, force thee against thy will, to be quiet? yes, The Prayer of
  such a friend as <hi>Moses, Orabat autem Moyses ad Dominum Deum suum.</hi>
  Beeing one, whom God so much respected. And as the loue of a friend doth tye
  the hands of some angry Lord, and keep him from striking; so Prayers binds Gods
  hands when hee is angry with vs, not suffering him to draw his sword. This was
  no small comfort to <hi>Dauid,</hi> which made him to sing the song of
  Thankesgiuing, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedictus Deus, qui non amouit orationem meam, &amp;
  misericordiam suam à me, Blessed be God, who hath not remooued either my
  prayer, or his owne mercie from mee.</hi> Saint <pb n="145" facs="tcp:22083:82"/>
                  <hi>Austen</hi> saith, That as long as God shall not take from out our mouthes
  and our hearts our praying vnto him, so long we may be well assured that he
  will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue his mercie from vs, for he neuer denieth those that faithfully
  cal vpon him</p>
               <p>But a matter of great consideration is that which we haue here
  in hand, <hi>Ecce mulier Cananea, Behold a Canaanitish woman, &amp;c.</hi>
  What? a woman that is an Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresse, can shee bee of that power that shee
  should ouercome God by prayer? When a weake arme cuts a man off by the wast at
  a blow, or hewes a bar of yron in sunder, this act is not attributed so much to
  the force of his arme, as the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his sword; so, this dayes noble act
  is not to bee attributed to a Pagan woman, (who was descended of that accursed
  <hi>Cham</hi>) but to the power of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. To those three diuine persons,
  Prayers are not permitted: for, as <hi>Thomas</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it, Prayer is to be
  directed to a superiour power: And if the Sonne of God did pray, it was
  according to his humanitie, hauing recourse (as Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith)
  to those two obligations of Priest and Aduocate: And if (Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
  saith) that the holy Ghost doth pray, <hi>Postulat pro nobis gemitibus in
  enarrabilibus, He ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth request for vs with grones that are
  vnspeakeable:</hi> It was, that he might teach vs how to pray, as Saint
  <hi>Augustine</hi> expoundeth it. The Deuills, and those that are damned, are
  not capable of prayer: Albeit the couetous rich man did desire a drop of water
  of <hi>Abraham</hi> to coole his tongue, &amp; the Deuills entreated
  Christ,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 16.</note> that he would giue them
  leaue to enter into the Swine. For to pray vnto God, is to turne vnto God, and
  with a sorowfull soule, and a contrite heart, humbly and earnestly to call vpon
  him, crauing pardon for our sinnes. Prayer therefore onely belongs vnto men, as
  well the Iust, as the Sinner; and that the Prayer of the Iust should preuaile
  with God, which begges and entreats of his diuine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie, That he will beare
  with vs this yeare, and the next, and so from time to time (as is prooued by
  that Parable of the Figge tree, which the Lord of the Soyle caused to be hewne
  downe, because it bare no fruit) it is not much: But that the prayer of a
  Canaanitish woman should make God to yeeld vnto her, is more than much. The
  name of woman, in it's true and naturall element, notifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a thousand
  imperfections: <hi>O pessima, &amp; Mulier,</hi> saith <hi>Euripides,</hi>
  signifying thereby, That there is no mischiefe which she is not a Midwife vnto;
  the verie name of a Canaanitish woman doth blab out sin in hir, hatred towards
  God, and a measure full of miserie. Now if a subiect so weake and so imperfect,
  grew by Prayer to be so powerfull; What will not Prayer be able to do?
  <hi>Salomon</hi> askes the question, <hi>Mulierem fortem quis inueniet? Who
  shall meet with a valiant woman,</hi> that is full of mettall and courage? I
  answer, That naturally such a one is <hi>Rara auis in terris,</hi> a verie
  Phoenix, a white Crow, and a blacke Swan; but by the force of Prayer you shall
  thrice meet with such a one: in Tyrus and Sydon God sayes no; and yet in the
  end, the Canaanitish womans Yea goes further than our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours Nay; making
  God, as it were, to lay downe the Bucklers, and to yeeld vnto her. And to him
  that shall say, That this was a spirituall wrestling, neuer giuing ouer our
  Sauiour, but still pressing and importuning him more and more; and that a woman
  will be sometimes so earnest and so violent, that shee may as well wearie out
  God, as she doth Man, to make him yeeld ere she haue done with him: To this, a
  Doctor of our times verie well answers, by proposing another questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; to wit,
  Whither <hi>Iacobs</hi> wrestling with God were with the force of his arms, or
  with the armes of Prayer? <hi>Origen</hi> tells vs, That it was a spirituall
  strugling of teares and prayers; and <hi>Iacob</hi> hauing got the better, God
  said vnto him, Thou shalt no more be called <hi>Iacob,</hi> but
  <hi>Israel,</hi> because thou hast had power with God. The like may be said by
  our Sauior to this Canaanitish woman.</p>

                  <hi>Ecce mulier Cananea, Behold a woman,
  &amp;c. Ecce,</hi> in holy Scripture commonly signifieth some great matter of
  admiration. And this case of the Canaanitish woman is admirable, for two rare
  circumstances contained in it.</p>
               <p>The one, For that strange change and alteration in her; in
  regard, that of a Canaanite <hi>in Occupatione,</hi> she became a Canaanite

  (according to Saint <hi>Hierome</hi>) is the same with <hi>Negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix.</hi>
  Of a good huswife, that girdeth her loyns with strength, and strengthneth her

  made for the encreasing of her Talent, and in mannaging of her businesse, that
  the Church sets her before vs for an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, and for an excellent and happie
  Negotiant with God himselfe. As <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> was put for a patterne of
  Faith; <hi>Isaac,</hi> of Obedience; <hi>Ioseph,</hi> of Chastitie;
  <hi>Iob,</hi> of Patience; <hi>Marie Magdalen,</hi> of Repentance; so this

  God, shewing vs the readie way for a quicke dispatch.</p>

  they might come againe to the fetching of it out: but when this their
  Captiuitie was ended, when they came to seeke for it, they found in stead
  thereof, a coagulated and crudded kind of water, as when it is frozen; but when

  those coles of loue begin to kindle anew, and to breake forth into their

  fell out, that vpon a sudden great shout of the People, he looked abroad to see
  what the matter was; Whereupon hee became another man, and altered his former

  There is not any greater pouertie (saith Saint <hi>Bernard</hi>) than that of

  goodnesse, as <hi>Leo</hi> the Pope sets it down vnto you more at large. Gods
  mercie is so infinite and so immense, that there is no comparison betwixt our
  merits and it; so short is our rightuousnesse of his goodnesse. Saint

  especiall, and more honourable, as Saint <hi>Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome</hi> and
  <hi>Euthimius</hi> vpon this verie place haue noted it vnto vs: So that both
  the nobler, and the learneder sort among them, besides the People in generall,
  did not onely hold it as an Article of their Faith, but for a great glorie vnto
  them, that their Messias was to descend from the loynes of <hi>Dauid,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn</hi> 7. <hi>Mat.</hi> 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Scriptum est; Quia de
  semine Dauid venit Christus.</hi> And our Sauiour asking of the Pharisees,
  Whose <pb n="149" facs="tcp:22083:84"/> sonne their Messias should bee? they did all agree
  in this, That hee should come from the Stocke of <hi>Dauid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now whither it were, that this Cananitish woman by giuing him
  this attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, thought with her selfe, That he had some obligation to fauour
  the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, (for the first Troupes that <hi>Dauid</hi> had, were of fugitiue
  Slaues and Forrei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, which came to his ayd, [<hi>Et factus est eorum
  Princeps</hi>] or whither the power that she saw he had in casting out Deuils,
  wrought thus vpon her; or whither the much honour that hee had alwaies shewne
  to women; or all of these together, were motiues of her pretension, I cannot
  tell you; but sure I am, that shee did beleeue, That our Sauiour Christ came
  into the world for to saue sinners, and for the generall good of all Mankind,
  for the Iew, and for the Gentile, and that the Deuills were subiect vnto him;
  (differing therein from the Pharisees, who made him <hi>Belzebubs</hi> Factor)
  and that there was no disease so incurable which this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Physition was
  not able to cure; and that he had past his word to the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test Sinners, That
  if they should call vpon God for mercie, and beleeue in his sonne Christ Iesus,
  whom he had sent into the world, he would free them from forth the depth of
  their miseries.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>He answered not a word. Origen,</hi> and almost all the rest
  of the Saints,<note place="margin">Why God many times shewes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe deafe and
 dumbe to our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests.</note> judge this silence of our Sruiour to bee verie
  strange, in regard ofthe strangenesse of the circumstances. First of all,
  Because that Fountaine (saith <hi>Origen</hi>) which was alwaies woont to
  inuite and call vs to drinke, doth now denie water to the Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie; the
  Physition that came to cure the Sicke, refuse to helpe his Patient; that
  Wisedome which cried out in the Market place with a loud voyce, <hi>Venite ad
  me,</hi> that it should now remaine dumbe, Who may not stand amased at it? O
  Lord, thou doost not onely accept of Prayer, but doost like of the bare desire
  to doe it; not onely of the lips, but of our willingnesse to mooue them. <hi>Et
  voluntate labiorum illius, non fraudasti eum,</hi> saith <hi>Dauid.</hi> And
  <hi>Wisedome, Optaui, &amp; datus est mihi sensus, When I prayed, vnderstanding
  was giuen me</hi>; and when I called,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Wisd.</hi>
 7.</note> the Spirit of Wisedome came vnto me.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That those prayers &amp; cries which come not from the
  heart, should notbe heard, it is not much. <hi>Aufer à me tumultum
  carminum tuorum,</hi> saith <hi>Amos,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Amos.</hi>
 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Take thou away from me the multitude of thy Songs</hi>; for I
  will not heare the melodie of thy Viols; And all because they were not from the
  heart. And in another place, <hi>Populus hic labijs me honorat, corde autem
  longe est, They honour me</hi> (saith <hi>Esay</hi>) <hi>with their lips, but
  their heart is farre from me.</hi> But this Cananitish woman did by her voice
  expresse her hearts griefe: and most true it is, That parents many times louing
  their children better than themselues, are more sencible of their sorows than
  of their owne.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it being so pious a businesse, as the freeing of her
  daughter from the torment of the Deuill; and being sent besides, of God into
  the world, <hi>Vt dissoluat opera Diaboli</hi>; the Apostles as well pittying
  the daughters miserie, as the mothers sorow, besought our Sauiour in her
  behalfe, saying, <hi>Dimitte illam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, There must be some great matter in it, some
  extraordinarie reason, why Christ should bee now more dumbe, than at other
  times: But of that wee haue spoken elsewhere. <hi>Clamaui per diem, &amp; non
  exaudies, &amp; nocte, &amp; non &amp;c.</hi> (they are the words of the sonne
  of God to his eternall Father) <hi>What, ô Lord,</hi> (sayth hee)
  <hi>shall I call vpon thee night and day, and wilt thou not heare mee?</hi> Thy
  silence can bee no scandall vnto mee, because I know the secrets of thy heart; 
  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:22083:85"/> and thy loue towards mee; Marry vnto others, it may giue
  great offence.</p>
               <p>In the former Chapter of this Storie, wee haue giuen some
  reasons of this silence. Of those which haue since offered themselues, let the
  first bee that of S. <hi>Chrisostome</hi>: If our Sauiour Christ (sayth he)
  should haue made present answer to the Canaanitish woman, her patience, her
  perseuerance, her prudence, her courage, and her faith, would not haue beene so
  much seene, nor manifested to the World. So that our Sauiour was not dumbe out
  of any scorne or contempt towards her, but because in the crysoll of these his
  put-byes, and disdaines, hee might discouer the treasure of her Vertues. And
  for this cause did Christ heape so many disgraces vpon her, one on the necke of
  another: one while, not seeming to take any notice of her griefs; another while
  stiling the Iews, children, and her selfe a dog. Wherewith this poore woman,
  was so far from being offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded or taking any exception at it, that humbly
  casting her self downe at his feet, shee did worship and adore him, allowing
  all that he sayd to be true, &amp; that these disgraces were worthily throwne
  vpon her, confessing her selfe to bee no better than a dog, yet notwithstanding
  shee comes vpon him againe with an <hi>Etiam Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, Yet the crums ô
  Lord, &amp;c.</hi> That with kind words and faire promises, and other gratious
  fauours, God should incourage his souldiers, put strength and boldnesse into
  them, and winne their loue and affection, it is not much; but that with
  disdaines and disgraces, they should receiue augmentation, and increase, (like
  <hi>Anteus,</hi> who the oftner he was by <hi>Hercules</hi> throwne to the
  ground, the abler and stronger hee grew) it is more than much. Hee that is in
  Loue, hath his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction rather inflamed than abated by disdaines: And this
  Canaanitish woman was falne so farre in loue with our Sauiour, that his
  neglecting of her could not quench the heat of her affection. In a word,
  because to fight against the disfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours of God, is one of the greatest proofes
  that a Soule can make of her prow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>esse; that this womans valour might bee the
  more seene, <hi>Non respondit ei ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bum, Hee answered not a word,
  &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second is of Saint <hi>Gregorie:</hi> Many times (saith he)
  God doth defer this or that fauor which we beg at his hands,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Psal.</hi> 7.</note> and for no other cause, but that he would
  haue vs to perseuer in Prayer. God is so well pleased, that wee should pray and
  sue vnto him, that with him, hee is <hi>Magis importunus, qui importunat minus,
  Most troublesome, that is least troublesome.</hi> Saint <hi>Austen</hi> sayth,
  that out of the pleasure and delight that hee taketh therein, God will haue vs
  to intreat him euen for those things, which are alreadie decreed vpon in his
  diuine Councell. And as his prouidence giues vs the fruits of the Earth, by the
  meanes of trauell and tillage; so he giues vs many good things, &amp; many rich
  blessings, by the means of prayer. <hi>Abrahams</hi> posteritie rested verie
  secure, in regard of the promise which God had made vnto them;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. <hi>Gen.</hi> 28.</note> And yet for all this,
  would hee haue <hi>Isaacs</hi> prayers to bee the meanes, that <hi>Rebecca</hi>
  of barren, should become fruitfull. There was great certaintie,<note place="margin">3. <hi>Kings</hi> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>8.</note> that God would send raine after that great drought, for
  to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort the children of Israel, yet would hee haue the prayer of
  <hi>Elias</hi> to bee the meanes to procure it. The health of <hi>Tobias</hi>
  and <hi>Sarah</hi> his wife stood vpon sure tearmes of safetie,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Tob.</hi> 3.</note> yet was hee aduised by <hi>Raphaell</hi>
  to pray, that the Deuill might not haue the power to take his life from him, as
  hee had done from the rest of her husbands. This made <hi>Thomas</hi> to bee of
  opinion, that our predestina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is propped vp and strengthened with the
  prayers of the Saints. And Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> affirmeth; That as the
  hands of a man are naturally, not onely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments of all things else, but of
  the verie instruments themselues; so is Praier in that which is spirituall.
  Saint <hi>Ierome</hi> and Saint <hi>Basil,</hi> make mention of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine 
  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:22083:85"/> Hereticke, who said, Seeing God knowes what I stand in
  need of, why should I seeke to trouble and importune him? Whereunto their
  answer is, That with God we are not to make our selues, <hi>Relatores
  necessitatis nostrae, sed reos, Not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters, but petitioners.</hi> And as
  there is a great inequalitie betwixt <hi>Relatorem,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Importunity in prayer plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to God.</note> and <hi>Reum</hi>;
  so is there likewise in their importunitie. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> is of
  opinion, That he who is not importunate, shewes he hath no great mind to that
  thing hee sues for; and that God will not grant him his request, because he
  seemes to set so light by it.</p>
               <p>The third is this, God doth not onely from thy prayers receiue
  pleasure,<note place="margin">Difference betwixt the maker of the image &amp; the
 worshipper.</note> but honour. <hi>Martial</hi> treating of Idolaters, sayth,
  That there is this difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Artificer that makes the Idoll, and
  him that prayes vnto it and adores it; that the Artificer onely makes the
  Image; but that he that prayes vnto it, and adores it, makes (as much as in him
  lies) a God of it; for by praying thereto, and adoring it, he doth openly
  protest and manifestly declare it's Diuinitie, and for his part, doth willingly
  acknowledge all reuerence and worship due to the same. 
  <q> 
                     <l>Qui fingit sacros, auro, vel marmore vultus,</l>

                  </q> Which kind of language is likewise vsed in Scripture. The
  Children of Israell cried out, <hi>Fac nobis Deos qui nos precedant, Make vs
  Gods to goe before vs</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but of <hi>Aaron</hi> it is said, That he made
  them a Calfe; it was <hi>Aaron</hi> that made the Calfe,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.</note> but they, that made the Calfe a God.
  Thou entrest into a Siluer-Smiths Shop, thou seest him at worke, thou askest
  him, What he is a doing? he tells thee, Hee is making the God <hi>Cupid</hi>;
  He speakes amisse, and does not say well in it; for it is he that bowes before
  him, prayes vnto him, and adores him, that makes him a God: for thou for thy
  part makest him neither worse nor better than an Idoll; it is he that sues vnto
  him, he that falls downe and worships him, equalling him in his seruice with
  God, that makes him a God. Of such Gods, God saith by <hi>Dauid, They that make
  them are like vnto them, and so are all such as put their trust in them.</hi>
  So that to beg or aske any thing of God, is to honour and praise him,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Psal.</hi> 115.</note> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king publique protestation, and open

  but God is not contented with this, but hee will haue thee on thy part to giue

                  <hi>Daniel</hi> chose rather to be cast into the Lyons Denne, than to leaue off
  his praying vnto God. <hi>Darius</hi> would needes make himselfe a God for
  thirtie dayes, and gaue command, That none should dare to make any supplication
  to any other but himselfe: It was a rash and vnad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised action in him to seeke
  to make himselfe a God; but it was no ill course in him, that he made this
  trouble of hearing their petitions, the meanes to remedy <pb n="152" facs="tcp:22083:86"/>
  what he found was amisse; for by hearing his Peoples complaints, he knew the
  better how to helpe them. And therefore God complaining of his People, That
  they did not come and sue vnto him, nor make their moane vnto him, hee brands
  them in the forehead to their foule shame, with a <hi>Non me inuocasti, Thou
  hast not called vpon me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fourth is S. <hi>Austens</hi>; who saith, That God sometime
  denies, sometimes grants our requests; one while more slow, another, more
  speedie, in yeelding to our petitions. The Deuill craued his leaue to tempt
  <hi>Iob,</hi> and hee presently gaue way to it. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did beg of
  him, that he might be freed from that euil An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell which tormented him, and his
  suit was denied; yet the Deuils dispatch was nothing so good as Saint
  <hi>Pauls</hi>: to the one it was quicke, but to his farther shame and
  confusion: to the other more slow, but to his greater grace and glorie. The
  Spouse treating of her Beloued, saith, <hi>I sought him, but I could not find
  him; I called him,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.6.</note> 
                  <hi>but he
  answered me not. Richardus de Sancto Victore</hi> saith, That God doth not
  presently replie to our Prayers, nor on the sudden grant our requests, to the
  end that he might make vs the better answer, and send vs away with the better
  dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch. It is a note of Saint <hi>Basils,</hi> That <hi>Salomons</hi>
  wisedome stayed so little a while with him, because God had so soone granted
  his request. And therefore it is commonly said, <hi>Que prestò se
  alcança se pierde, Soone got, soone lost.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fift is of <hi>Victor Antiochenus.</hi> Our Sauiour Christ
  (saith he) threw so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie disgraces vpon this woman of Tyrus and Sydon, and
  yet gaue her strength withall to continue so couragious and constant all the
  while, to the end that if the Iewes should either grow enuious or jealous of
  the fauour that our Sauiour shewed vnto her, by taking exception at his
  <hi>Fiat tibi sicut vis, Bee it vnto thee as thou wouldst haue it</hi>; and at
  that his extraordinarie commending of her, when he tells her, <hi>I haue not
  found such great Faith, no not in Israell</hi>: he might verie wel ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
  himselfe vnto them, by shewing vnto them, that this was <hi>violentiae magis,
  quam voluntatis, rather a violent, than a voluntarie action,</hi> and that
  whither hee would or no, he was in a manner forced and compelled to doe as he
  did: For it is not vnknowne vnto you, how scornefull I shewed my selfe vnto
  her, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny disgraces I put vpon her; yet all would not doe, but she is more
  importunate vpon me than before, so that her Faith did enforce me to yeeld. He
  that is truly in loue, auoyds the occasions that may bee offensiue to his Loue:
  Nor can that loue be too much indeered, which our Sauiour bare vnto the Iewes,
  which made him so loath to offend them: but neuer was there any woman so
  jealous of her husband, as the Iewes were of the Gentiles, as also of our
  Sauiours conuersing with them.</p>
               <p>The sixt, That one of the noblest and most heroicall acts of our
  Faith, is, That a man should loue his Maker, cal to God for mercie and
  forgiuenesse of his sinnes, desire victorie ouer his temptations, and sue and
  beg, and that earnestly, not a yeare or two, but ten yeares together; and God
  all this while not retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning him any answer, that he should for all this still
  perseuer in these his constant courses of Prayer, is a thing, I know not
  whither more to be commended, than admired.<note place="margin">

                     </gap>
  takest no notice of it. Moses</hi> did desire of God, That he would doe him the
  fauour to let him see his face: that he should talke with God, and God speake
  again to him; this would not content him, he must see him, forsooth, else all
  the rest was as nothing: In what case would hee then haue beene, had hee
  neither seene nor <pb n="153" facs="tcp:22083:86"/> heard of him? Of <hi>Baal</hi> the
  diuine Historian deliuereth,<note place="margin">3. <hi>Kings</hi> 18.</note>
                  <hi>There was neither voice to be heard, nor one to answer, nor any that
  regarded.</hi> He was a false god; but that our God should be deafe at our
  cries, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The seuenth, That a mother should breed vp her daughter so ill,
  that shee should fall into the Deuills hands, <hi>Male à Daemonio
  vexatur</hi> [the Greeke, <hi>Daemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizatur</hi>] it is not much, that Christ
  should not make her any answer; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though no man can liue free from the
  batterie of Hell, yet a mother that shall thrust her daughter into it, must
  hold her selfe an vnfortunate woman: <hi>For it is necessarie that scandalls
  should come</hi>; yet Christ did mourn for those through whose meanes they were
  occasioned.</p>
               <p>The last, God doth deferre the fauours thou beggest of him, to
  the end thou maist esteeme the better of them when they come; for wee lightly
  esteeme of those things that cost vs but little labour. <hi>Elisha</hi> could
  haue healed <hi>Naaman</hi> the King of Syria's Fauourite, either by his word
  onely, or by laying his hands vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his leprosie, or by willing him to wash
  himselfe but once in Iordan; but hee would haue him to wash himselfe therein
  seuen times, because hee should not disesteeme of it. <hi>Speciosa mesericordia

  It is like a Cloud of raine in the time of a drought. For these, and other the
  aforesaid reasons, our Sauiour Christ would not giue eare to this humble
  petition of this poore Canaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitish woman.</p>

  by importunitie; as one, who to still a bauling Curre, throwes him a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell

                  </note> Saint <hi>Peter</hi> calls
  him <hi>Principem pastorum</hi>; and he prooues him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to be a Sheepheard,
  by his going forth to seeke after this lost Sheepe. And if we mean to haue our
  habitation in Heauen, &amp; to be of the same Fold with the Saints, we must
  first be this Sheepheards Sheepe vpon earth, before wee can come to be his
  Saints in Heauen. For albeit the Iust beare the name of Sheepe, as is noted by
  Saint <hi>Hierome,</hi> Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> Saint <hi>Gregorie,</hi> and
  Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi>; yet all that haue this name shall not come to Heauen;
  for many, of Sheepe shall become Wolfes.</p>
               <p>First, The proportion of our Sauior Christs giuing to his, the
  name of Sheep and of Lambes, consists first of all in their innocencie and
  simplicitie; whereof the Sheepe and the Lambe are the true symbole and
  hieroglyphicke; as it is prooued by Saint <hi>Gregorie</hi> and Saint
  <hi>Cyprian</hi> in the place before alledged. <hi>Quid per Oues nisi

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Sheep, to shew, that Christian
  innocencie should equall that of theirs,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Cyprian.</hi>
  When the Angel with that his naked Sword in his hand went making that
  feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full slaughter amongst the Israelites, <hi>Dauid</hi> humbly kneeling on
  his knees makes his mones vnto God, and saith, <hi>Isti qui Oues sunt,
  quidfecerunt? What haue these poore Sheepe done,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2.
 <hi>Kings</hi> 24.</note> these innocent Lambes? it is I that haue sinned,
  smite mee, and not them: Let thy hand, I pray, bee against mee and my fathers
  House; but spare these thy Sheepe, who syllie harmelesse Creatures haue no way
  offended thee.</p>
               <p>Secondly, This proportion consists in that wonderfull obedience
  which the Sheepe carrie to the Sheepeheard, who with a word or a whistle
  bridleth their appetites, and keepes them within their bounds, not offering to
  stray into strange Pastures. This is that which <hi>Dauid</hi> said, <hi>His
  eare was obedient to me</hi>: And our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Christ, <hi>My Sheepe heare my
  voyce.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, In that, those that are lost and gone astray, shew
  their discomfort, by bleating and following from hill to hill, from pasture to
  pasture, path to path, the steps of his Sheepheard, lifting vp his head, and
  bending his eare on the one <pb n="155" facs="tcp:22083:87"/> side, and listning whither he
  can heare the sound of his voyce, and many times he will leane one eare to the
  ground, the better to helpe his attention. Saint <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose</hi> saith, That
  one of the greatest pledges that a Sinner can desire of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destination,
  is, to be like vnto the lost Sheepe, to shew himselfe sad and heauie, when he
  misseth his Sheepheard that should protect him, and looke well vnto him; to
  make his moane, send out sighes and sobs like so many blea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ings, to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the tracke of his footsteps, to listen
  to his whistle, to hearken to his voyce, and to giue eare vnto his call: for
  that sinner that shal do so, it is an euident token that he was borne for
  Heauen.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, There is nothing in a Sheepe, whatsoeuer it be, but is
  good &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable; (as the flesh, the bloud, the milke, the wooll, and the
  fell) but nothing that is hurtfull: besides, it is a most fruitfull creature,
  <hi>Oues fatosae abundantes in fae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus suis, Our Sheepe bring forth thousands
  and ten thousands in our streets.</hi> The just man is likewise full of
  goodnesse, and full of profit, in his words, and in his workes, in his
  thoughts, in his wealth, in his pouertie, in his health, and in his sickenesse:
  but nothing in him that is hurtf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ll. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> reckoning the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and properties of
  Charitie, repeateth first the good that it doth, <hi>Patiens est, benigna est,
  &amp;c. Loue suffereth long, it is bountifull, &amp;c.</hi> And anon after, he

                  <hi>Loue doth not boast it selfe, it is not
  puffed vp, it doth no vncomely thing, it seeketh not her owne things, it is not
  prouoked to anger, it thinketh no euill, it reioyceth not in iniquitie,
  &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fiftly, It's patience and gentlenesse when they sheere him and
  robbe him of his Fleece, turning him this way or that way, when they bind his
  legs, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise vse him hardly, and put him to paine, he scarce offereth to
  bleat or open his mouth; he goes as willingly to the Butchers blocke, as to his
  greene pastures; and when the Butcher puts his knife to his throat, hee beholds
  him with a gentle and louely looke. In a word, <hi>Esay</hi> endeering the
  infinite patience of our Sauiour Christ, could not find any comparison fitter
  for him, than that of the Sheepe and the Lambe, <hi>Sicut Ouis ad occisionem
  ductus est, sicut Agnus coram tondente, se ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutuit, He went like a Sheepe to
  the slaughter, and like a Lambe before the shearer, hee opened not his
  mouth.</hi> This then is the nature and qualitie of the mysticall Sheep of the
  Church, <hi>Caeduntur gladijs, &amp;c. They are smitten with swords, yet
  neither mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure nor complaine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixtly, Saint <hi>Basil</hi> and Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> both
  affirme, That the Sheepe ordinarily do eat and chew the cud, but then most of
  all (by a naturall instinct) when Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter drawes on, and then he feeds a great
  deale faster, and with more eagernesse, as diuining, that through the
  inclemencie of the Heauens, and the bitternesse of the cold, he shall not find
  feeding sufficient for him. And this is a lesson for vs, to teach vs what we
  are to doe: The Sheep of Christs flocke vsually are to seeke for their feeding
  in the pastures of Vertue, either by ruminating, meditating, or contemplating;
  but when they see death approching neere vpon them, they must fall more
  speedily and more earnestly to their meat; for when the Winter of death shall
  come vpon them, they will not find whereon to feed. And therefore worke
  righteousnesse before thou die; like vnto the Ant, who prouides in the Summer
  against the rigour of the Winter: <hi>Quoniam non est apud inferos, inuenire
  cibum, In hell there is no meat to be got for any money</hi>: and the hunger in
  Hell is so strange, that the Damned feed vpon their owne tongues.</p>
               <p>For these his Sheep God came into the world, <hi>Quantum ad
  efficaciam,</hi> though he came also for all the whole world in generall:
  <hi>Quantum ad sufficientium,</hi> effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually for His; but sufficiently
  forall. And it is a fearefull thing to thinke on, <pb n="156" facs="tcp:22083:88"/> which
  is noted by Saint <hi>Bernard</hi>; to wit, That he that shal not be a sheepe
  in this life,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Psal.</hi> 49.</note> shall after death be
  damned to Hell; <hi>Sicut Oues in inferno positi sunt, They lie in Hell like
  sheepe, and death gnaweth vpon them.</hi> As here we take the fleece from off
  our Sheepe, and leaue them naked and poore; so there the Wolfe shall be
  flee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of his riches, and of all the pleasures and comforts that hee tooke in
  this world, and be left not only naked, but full likewise of paine and torment;
  <hi>Mors depascet eos, Death shall gnaw vpon them,</hi> and dying to life, they
  shall liue to death.</p>

Cisternes of water, &amp;c.</hi>) this of all the rest was the most famous.
<hi>Iosephus</hi> calls it, <hi>Stagnum Salomonis,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was built
by this King, neere vnto the Temple, for the seruice of sacred things: it was a
Poole that was wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led round about, whereunto your heards and flockes of

hid the holy Fire which <hi>Nehemias</hi> afterwards found to bee conuerted

porches full of diseased people, some of one infirmitie, and some of
another.</p>
            <p>This Hospitall ioyned to the backe of the Temple, to shew, that
the poore haue no other prop in this life to vphold them, saue Gods backe; this
must bee their strength, hereunto must they leane: it is our Sauiours shoulders
that must not onely beare vs vp, but our infirmities, by taking them vpon
himselfe.</p>
            <p>In Saint <hi>Chrysostomes</hi> time, the Hospitals were set apart
from the Temples, for feare of receiuing infection from those contagious
diseases: For the poore did lie like so many Dogges, at the doores of Gods
house. A Theefe, that he may the better enter that house where there are many
doggs, holds it his best course, <pb n="161" facs="tcp:22083:90"/> to stop their mouths
with somthing or other: We are all Theeues, and that we may enter peaceably
into Gods House, there is no better meanes, than to giue something to the
poore, which like so many Dogges lie at the gate. Twice in the Old Testament
hath God commanded, That no man should petition him with emptie hands; [<hi>Non

did honour his Temple with this Poole, where there was a perpetuall prouision
for health; and it was a prouidence full of conueniencie, that God should
conferre his fauours where his name is praysed, and that Man should receiue
them there where hee praiseth him. <hi>Te decet Hymnus Deus in Syon, tibi

here art thou to beg, and here to receiue the granting of thy petitions. And
for this cause God calls his house the house of Prayer, which is ordained to
begge those things of God which we stand in need of, and to praise him for what
he giues, and we receiue.</p>
            <p>The Court is the Worlds Epitome, an abreuiation, or short
abridgement of this greater Vniuerse; for that it hath in it whatsoeuer is
dispersed throughout the face of the earth. And this Poole is a figure of the
Court: First of all, in this Poole there are a great many of sicke &amp;
diseased persons, &amp; those of verie foule and filthie diseases, blind,
wasted in their bodies, benumm'd, withered, lame, and maimed. <hi>Iacere<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
To lie,</hi> in Scripture is spoken of those that are dead, (as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth

lie at the point of death) as likewise of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> when he lay at
<hi>Diues</hi> his gate. So saith Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> in this place,
<hi>Multitudo languentium iaceba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> i. <hi>There lay a great multitude of sicke men.</hi> In the
Court there are a great many that lie sicke of diuers and sundrie dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases of
the Soule; an Apoplexy seiseth vpon all the sences of the bodie; one pretension
or other possesseth the sences of the bodie, and the faculties of the Soule,
and vpon all whatsoeuer belongs vnto man; as his honour, his wealth, his
conscience, and truth, &amp;c. This man came to the Poole benumm'd, and at 
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:22083:91"/> the end of thirtie eight yeares was more benumm'd than at
first; and if our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Christ had not helped him, it is probable he would
haue perished. Many come to the Court, to recouer themselues of an infirmitie
that followes them, called Pouertie; and after many yeares trauell, and paines
taking, they prooue poorer than before, and oft die of that disease: whereas if
they had bin conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with their former meane estate, they might perhaps not
haue died so soone. And although they get the Office they pretend, yet doe they
neuer come to be rich, because their profits doe not equall their charges.
<hi>Seneca</hi> saith, That if these men would haue taken councell of those who
haue tryed this poole some few yeares, they would alter their mind. If he that
applies himselfe to the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of <hi>Venus</hi> in his youth, would but
follow the aduice of him who lies in his bed laden with the Pox, &amp; hath not
a bone in all his bodie that wishes him well, <hi>Vota mutasset, Hee would haue
changed his vowes.</hi> If hee that desires to become a Courtier, will but
hearken to him, who being chap-fallen and toothlesse, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing spent all his
life time in the seruice of the Court, goes away at last vnrewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, if not
ill requited; <hi>Vota mutasset, He would haue altered his course.</hi>
Besides, the diseases in Court are so foule and so vncurable, that it is a
miracle, to see one of a thousand of them to be made whole: who, when the wind
of Ambition and Pretension fit faire and prosperous vpon him, will change his
Councellors robe, retyre himselfe from businesses of the world, put on an
Hermits Weed, and in some solitarie Cell betake himselfe wholly to his
deuotion? Who, beeing the Fauourite of a King, will not rather loose his life,
than leaue the Court? Who that is sicke (like him of the Dropsie) of that

            </p>
            <p>Secondly, In this Fish-poole all did liue in hope,
<hi>Expectantium aquae motum, Weighting for the moouing of the water</hi>; Led
along with this hope, they suffered much miserie, but other good had they none.
By <hi>Osee</hi> God said to Israell, <hi>Dies multos expectabis me, I will
cause thee, vt sperando, desperes, That thy hopes end in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire.</hi> The
greatest torment that the Iewes suffer in this life, is, That al the types and
figures of their hopes being past, (let them looke as long as they will for a
Messias) in reuenge of their vnbeleefe, their vnderstandings are so blinded,
that they still remaine condemned to wait vpon this idle hope.</p>

that hath no bodie to stand his friend, must stay weighting some thirtie eight
yeares, and then too in the end must haue the helpe of some miracle to heale
him of his sickenesse.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, In this Fish-poole they all weighted diligently, and were
wonderfull <pb n="163" facs="tcp:22083:91"/> carefull and vigilant, when the water should
mooue, and then did they rush in speedily, lest some other should preuent them
and step in before them. In the Court your Pretenders stand attending with a
great deale of care, when Offices are to be bestowed, and other prouisions
granted forth, shouldring and shoouing one another, that others may not get the
start of them, and clap in betwixt them and home. <hi>Seneca</hi> compares the
Courtiers to Butchers Curres, who in the sham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles stand looking with a
watchfull eye for some offalls of the intrailes that shall be throwne downe
amongst them, for the which they fall together by the eares; but one hauing the
mor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ell, and the other going
whining away, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, He that was sped first in the Fish-poole, and had his
pretension, left the rest sad and enuying his good fortune. So likewise in
Court, hee that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines his pretension, causes such a sadnesse in the rest,
that for many moneths af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, all is cries and complaints, lamenting and
finding fault with the inequality of the times, and how strangely things are
carried, Hand (as they say) ouer head. He that pretends a Captains place, the
gouernment of a Garrison Towne, or the keeping of a Fort, frets and fumes, when
he knowes he hath done the State good seruice in the Warres, to see a Carpet
Knight, that can better vse a Violl than a Sword, lead a measure with a Ladie
than a Band of men, be preferred, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe put by. So is it with your good
Schollers, when they see Dunces carrie away their preferments from them: And so
with the like, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, One Angell onely mooued the waters of the Fish-poole; but
those waters of the Court, many Angells, or, to speake more properly, many
Deuils must mooue them; and when one fauours, foure disfauour them: one mooues
here, but many there trouble the waters; &amp; to make so many mens wils to
trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, is a grieuous torment. <hi>Abimileck</hi> the bastard sonne of
<hi>Gideon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iudges</hi> 9.</note> desirous to
ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannise the gouernment of Israell, alledged this reason to those of Sichem,
Which seemeth better vnto you, That the seuentie sonnes of <hi>Gideon</hi>
should rule ouer you, or one onely? And, which is the easier of the two, to
submit a mans will to seuentie wils, or to one will only? King <hi>Achish</hi>
out of this respect thrusts <hi>Dauid</hi> out of his Court; For myne owne part
(said he) I like thee well enough, <hi>Sed Satrapis non placis,</hi> (i.)
<hi>But thou art not pleasing to the Princes.</hi> In Court, a man must crowch
and creepe to many: Happie is that man that negotiates with God, there is but
one care to be taken, one onely good will to bee got. According to that of
<hi>Tertullian, Vnum negotium mihi est, neque aliud curo. Gregorie N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Vnus &amp; solus, One, and onely one,</hi> to shew his sole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand ouer
vs; so did he also assume many names to himselfe, to giue vs thereby to
vnderstand, that he was willing to affoord vs many fauours. Whereas the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
takes a contrarie course; for hee inuented many gods to commaund in the world,
but not any to doe them good.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, In the Fish-poole men had their healths giuen them for
nothing, so that it cost not the sicke one farthing: dealing with the Patient,
as Heauen doth with the Penitent; who when he desires to embarke himselfe for
that place, giues him his passage in the Ship of Repentance, free, and gratis,

his desire and willingnesse to be whole; [<hi>Vis sanus

before thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mest to the <hi>Fiat</hi> of thy pretension, thou hast eaten
out thy cloake, and it is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if the courtesie quit the cost.</p>
            <p>Seuenthly, The Angell that came to the Fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h-poole (as all the Commentators <pb n="164" facs="tcp:22083:92"/>
vpon this place haue it) was one and the same, no accepter of persons, but left
euerie one to his owne diligence and industrie; and hee that could soonest get
into the water, he was the man that was cured. Had he been an Angel of court,
(as he was of Heauen) he must haue beene aduised some houres before his
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, of the businesse, and peraduenture he would haue taken gifts and
rewards not onely of those that were to haue their estate bettered by him, but
of al other the Pretenders. And it were no ill councell, that there should be
but one onely in Court, that should heale vs in this case, and not to haue them
so often chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; for those which are put out remain fat and full, and those
that newly come in, weake and hunger-staru'd. And as those Flies that are
alreadie full doe lesse afflict the wounds of the Poore; so, &amp;c.
<hi>Baruch</hi> tells vs, That the Iewes that were in Babylon sent great store
of money to those that were in Ierusalem, that they should pray vnto God for
the life of <hi>Nabucadonazzar</hi> &amp; <hi>Balthazar</hi> his son: And
though this may seeme rather a tricke of Court, than otherwise, and to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
of flatterie; yet that which makes for our porpose, is, That they did desire
the life of those Tirants, for feare lest God should send them worse in their
stead. The like was spoken by a woman, to <hi>Dyonisius</hi> the Tyrant, whose
death was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally desired of all.</p>
            <div type="part">

               <p>
                  <hi>But the Angell of the Lord came downe from Heauen.</hi> The
  Angell did descend at certaine times, and with onely touching the Water, hee
  did inrich it with so powerfull a vertue, that no infirmitie was incurable for
  it. This water doth much expresse that health which the Saints enioy in Heauen:
  that drop of water which the rich man desired, doth much expresse its comfort
  and happinesse, for that the tip of the least finger dipped therein, was
  powerful enough to quench those euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting flames. It was much, that the
  water touched by the Angell should free all infirmities, and take away all the
  tormenting paines vpon earth; but how much (I pray) if this Angell were God?
  For the common receiued opinion is, (which is followed by Saint
  <hi>Austen</hi>) That God representing himselfe in the Old Testament in the
  forme of an Angell, or an Angell appearing in the person of God,<note place="margin">

  able to doe or vndoe any thing in nature, nor suddenly either to take away or
  adde accidents to any thing. And Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith, That this Angell

  that God should minister helpe to filthie, loathsome, and miserable flesh, God
  could not endure to doe such kindnesses, vnlesse hee had an especiall loue vnto
  them. The Scripture scarce any where makes mention of the righteous man that is
  afflicted here vpon earth, but, that an Angel comes from Heauen to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
  him: And for this, may suffice that generall Proclamation, <hi>Quod vni ex

               <p>The other, That they are the harder to be seene or holpen: To be
  seene, for that they are so secret, <hi>Ab occultis meis munda me, Clense me,

  but will shunne thee, and turne his face from thee. If thou wilt experiment,

               <p>This hurt (I meane when base and vnworthie persons gouerne a

  making choice of such men who by good and euill meanes (making no great

  rather die than loose it. And when hee is thus preposterously preferred and put

  out another, &amp; so as hee may raise himselfe to honor, cares not whom he
  disgraces and treads vnder foot, though they bee ten times better men, and
  worthier than himselfe. <hi>Moses</hi> by Gods appointment made choice of
  seuentie Elders of Israell to assist him in the gouernment of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and
  they being one day to meet at a certaine houre before the Tabernacle, to the
  end that God in the presence of all the people might put his Spirit of
  pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie vpon them, there remained two behind among the Host, to wit,
  <hi>Eldad</hi> and <hi>Medad</hi>; &amp; because God is not confined to any set
  place, the Spirit likewise rested vpon them, and they prophecied in the Host.
  <hi>Ioshuah</hi> thought this was a disreputation to <hi>Moses,</hi> that these
  two should prophecie without especiall order from him, insomuch that he
  persuaded him that hee should forbid them to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie any more. This is a
  true picture of the course &amp; fashion of this present World, which will by
  no meanes admit of any Ministers of State, but such as they themselues shall
  nominate, or (as if they were creatures of their making) shall wholly depend
  vpon them. But the Spirit of God made answer vnto <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shuah</hi> by the
  mouth of <hi>Moses, Quid aemularis pro me? Enuiest thou for my sake?</hi> and
  addeth anon after, Would to God all the Lords people were Prophets, and that
  the Lord would put his Spirit vpon them. So that men are neuer wanting for to

  The Israelites had it <hi>ex patribus, of their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers</hi>; but because

  this his strange de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerance. Secondly, This particle <hi>Ecce,</hi>
  expresseth the greatnesse of this poore mans obligation; as if it should bid
  him looke and behold how much hee was beholding vnto God, who had freed him
  from so desperate a disease. <hi>Cum enim augentur dona, rationes etiam
  crescunt donorum,</hi> (the saying is Saint <hi>Gregories</hi>) <hi>The greater
  kindnesses, the greater obligations.</hi> This therefore being so great a one,
  thou canst not chuse but thinke vpon this benefit, and continually beare it in
  mind. <hi>Homo cum in honore esset, non intellexit, Man when he was in honour
  vnderstood it not,</hi> [the Hebrew hath it, <hi>Non pernoctauit</hi>] hee did
  not consider well on the matter, he did not throughly weigh it, by meditating
  night and day on so great a good. Thirdly, This same <hi>Ecce</hi> serues him
  as a warning-piece, to put him in mind, that he is sound, but not secure; for
  if thou doost not looke well vnto thy selfe, and stand strongly vpon thy guard,
  thou maist fall from that health wherein now thou standest, and be worse than
  thou wert before.</p>

  God giues vs the good things of this life, to the end that in them we may see a
  shaddow, as it were of Heauen: The euill, That we may by them see the tracke of
  the cruell rigour of those hellish torments. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> treating of
  those euills that befall the Righteous, saith, <hi>Quasi morientes, quasi
  tristes, quasi, &amp;c.</hi> As dying, as chastned, as sorrowing,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.</note> as poore, as hauing nothing: He there
  reckoneth vp a bead-roll of many seeming ills, but not euills in deed; for
  their dying was to them liuing, their sorrowing, reioycing; their pouertie,
  riches; and their hauing nothing, a possessing of all things, &amp;c. <hi>Quasi
  flagellum.</hi> It is said of our Sauiour Christ, That he made a kind of whip,
  as it were, of those little cords wherewith the Sellers in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple bound vp
  their fardles. For in respect of Hell-whips, the whips of this life are not
  whips, but <hi>quasi flagella,</hi> as it were whips. The Scripture christneth
  hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane troubles with the name of Waters, <hi>Emitte manum tuam, &amp; libera

               <p>The one, That the troubles of the Godly doe passe away like

               <p>That though the waters be now and then troubled, they afterwards

Soules.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He tooke vnto him Peter, &amp;c.</hi> First of all,
<hi>Damascene</hi> saith, That our Sauiour did not carrie all his Apostles with
him vp to the Mount; for it was not fit that <hi>Iudas</hi> should enioy so
great a blessing, in whom that prophecie of <hi>Esay</hi> was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled,
<hi>In terra sanctorum iniquè gessit, &amp; non videbit gloriam
Dei.</hi> Hee who in so holy a companie committed such a vile treacherous act,
as to betray and sell his Master, for the loue of a little money, did not
deserue to enioy the glory of Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor. So that to the end <hi>Iudas</hi> might
not complaine, That Christ had discarded him, and quite shut him out from this
blessing; this holy Saint saith, That those other good &amp; holy men were for
his sake debard of that good: whence we may gather, what hurt many an honest
man receiues by keeping a lewd knaue compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie. But because it might haue
seemed a scandalous piece of businesse, to haue left <hi>Iudas</hi> all alone
by himselfe, the rest remained with him; <hi>Iudas</hi> his companie being no
lesse dangerous to the Colledge of Iesus his Disciples, than it was te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
and wearisome to our Sauiour himselfe. Insomuch that when <hi>Iudas</hi> was
gone out of the house where Christ supt with his Disciples, (which he did
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently vpon the receiuing of the sop) he said, <hi>Nunc glorificatus est
Filius hominis, Now is the Sonne of man glorified.</hi> When Christ multiplied
his miracles,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iohn</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>Iohn</hi> 7.</note> Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> saith, <hi>Non erat
Spiritꝰ datus, quia Christus nondu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> erat glorificatus, The holy Ghost was
not yet giuen, because that Iesus was not yet glorified.</hi> Why Christ, being
neere vnto his death, should hold himselfe to be glorified, and in the working
of miracles not to be glorified? For the decision of that point, I shal referre
you vnto Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine.</hi> You see here how the wind was come about,
<hi>Iudas</hi> was no sooner gone out, but he saith, hee is glorified; but
before, knowing who should betray him, hee told <hi>Peter, Vos mundi estis, sed
non omnes,</hi> (i.) <hi>Yee are cleane, but not all.</hi> The Cockle was taken
away, and the Wheate now pure and cleane; and our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour tooke it for a great
glorie vnto him, to see himselfe thus wholly rid of his companie.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> sayth, That hee tooke those
three along with him, because he alwayes loued them best. Showing thereby,<note place="margin">The publicke to be preferred before the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iuate.</note> that Princes may lawfully haue their
Priuadoes, and Fauourites, to whome they may giue more grace and countenance,
than to others; but withall, that they ought to bee such, as should bee
disinterressed, and not desire any more for themselues than their Princes
grace, leauing the rest of his fauours to bee communicated to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as well
as themselues. Saint <hi>Iude</hi> once askt of our Sauiour Christ, <hi>How
comes it to passe, that thou shouldst manifest thy selfe vnto vs, and not vnto
the World?</hi> Hee thought, that the Sunne should inlighten all. But because
he did first bestow his light on the mountaine tops, it was fit, that the
grace, which they receiued, they should gratis confer vpon others, <hi>Like
good Stewards.</hi> The Euangelist cals Saint <hi>Peter</hi> foole, because hee
would haue all for himselfe, and those that were there with him. And if
<hi>Elias,</hi> and <hi>Moses,</hi> were admitted to mount Tabor, it was,
because they were louers of the common good. <hi>Moses</hi> once disired of
God, that he would let him see his face; but God told him, hee could not see
his face and liue. It seemeth, that here <hi>Moses</hi> shewed himselfe to bee
but a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; What, to inioy a poore life for the present, wouldst thou forgoe
so great a happinesse? But it was not the loue of his owne life; but the loue
that he bare to his people, who would haue had a great misse of him. Whereof
there was <pb n="182" facs="tcp:22083:101"/> afterwards verie good proofe, when God sayd
vnto him, Let me make an end of this people at once, and I will make thee a
mightier and a better Nation. Whereunto hee answered, I am so farre from giuing
way to this, That I shall beseech thee either to pardon them, or to blot me out
of the Booke of life; for I had rather not liue, than liue without them. Doost
thou offer to lay down thy life for thy people? And wilt thou not loose it to
see God face to face? The one, was a particuler, the other a common good.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Hee tooke onely three along with him; manifesting
thereby, that hee was as sparing of his Glorie in this life, as he was liberall
of his Crosse. <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> sayth, That hee tooke those three with him,
not so much to make them partakers of this his Glorie, as to beare witnesse
thereof. And therefore carryed three, because they are a full and sufficient
testimonie. And this was a great comfort to those that were left behind; not
that they did dismerit the like fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor; but that there was a necessitie in it,
that some should abide with <hi>Iudas.</hi> For, if hee should haue beene left
alone, hee would haue tooke it for a great disgrace. But those other, did not
therefore merit lesse, by beeing left behind; For if the fauour, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>wards those that went vp, seemed to bee
the greater, yet the deserts of those that were left, were not inferrior to
those that were admitted. For af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards some of those suffered for the
Glorie, which they had seene, and most of these for the Glorie they had not
seene.</p>
            <p>To this purpose there are two Stories in the Scripture, one of
<hi>Eldad</hi> and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dad</hi>;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Num.</hi> 11.</note>
which (according to the Scholasticall Historie) were halfe-brothers to
<hi>Moses</hi>; and beeing nominated amongst the seuentie for the gouernement
of the people, came not at all to the Tabernacle where God did communicate part
of <hi>Moses</hi> his spirit to the rest: But though they stayd behind in their
Tents, yet did they not loose this blessing, but did prophecie as well as the
rest. The other is of <hi>Dauid,</hi> who pursuing those that had burned
Ziklag, two hundred souldiers were left behinde with the baggage; but when they
had got the victorie, the spoiles were equally deuided, as well betweene those
that had ventured their liues in the battaile, as those that guarded the
stuffe. <hi>As his part is that goeth down to the battaile,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. <hi>Kings</hi> 30.</note> 
               <hi>so shall his part bee that
tarrieth by the stuffe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, Onely three; Because amongst few, all kind of obseruance
and vertue is better conserued. Howbeit the Church doth dayly pray, that the
number of the Iust may be increased. Which the greater it is, the more
graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous it is, and more comely in Gods sight. But as it is commonly taken,
the greater the number, the greater the harme. In the beginning of the world,
when there were few people, the harme was not much. But then the number of men
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing,<note place="margin">Prosperity al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies enuied.</note> sinne so
increased in the world, that God repented himselfe that he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> had made it. He was sorrie in his heart, that hee had
made both it, and man. That beeing verified of them,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.</note> which <hi>Esay</hi> sayd vnto God;
<hi>Thou hast multiplyed the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but not their Ioy.</hi> The Church
beginning to flourish, What followed? there were many Foxes, that did it much
mischiefe. As the wheat increaseth, so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth the tares. So, that much
prosperitie (in <hi>Senecas</hi> opinion) sometimes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth much pouertie.
<hi>Augustine</hi> in his booke <hi>De Ciuit. Dei,</hi> prooueth this truth,
out of the Romane Histories; Romes owne greatnesse, beeing it's owne ruine.
<hi>Suis Roma viribus ruit.</hi> No sword could cut her throat, but her
owne.</p>
            <p>Lastly, Onely three; A number (<hi>Aristotle</hi> following the
opinion of <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras</hi>) which containeth in it a vniuersitie of
things. And for that it is so full of mysterie, sufficeth, That it is
consecrated to the most sacred and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Trinitie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="183" facs="tcp:22083:101"/>To him that shal ask me,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ob.</hi>
               </note> why Christ caried not his mother with him to
mount Tabor, as well as he did to mount Caluerie? I answere, That all
that,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sol.</hi>
               </note> which he suffered in mount
Caluerie, was in respect of his mother, in so much that this her sonne
complained, that God had forsaken him. But that Glorie, which hee inioyed in
mount Tabor, he had that from his father; So that the seeing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, did
nothing at all belong to his mother.</p>
            <p>Some man may doubt, why these three descending from the
Mount,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ob.</hi>
               </note> should aduise the rest, of the

interdiction was not for the disciples, but for the people onely.</p>
            <p>But some one may reply;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ob.</hi>
               </note> Why
Enuy did not possesse their hearts that stayd behind; and Pride puffe vp theirs

They beeing all incensed against <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> for desiring
to be in neerest place to our Sauiour. I answer;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sol.</hi>
               </note> That this their striuing who should be
greatest, and this their chaires of Ambition, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose a most base opinion of
the Kingdome of our Sauiour Christ: for that they imagined it (as before hath
beene prooued) to be terrestriall and temporall. And touching these goods of
the earth, not onely secular Kings and Princes, are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to goe together by
the eares for them; but also your Ecclesiasticall persons, those that are the
holiest and honestest Church-men, labor to defend them with all their might and
maine. For they fall so short of those other, that are heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they
beeing deuided amongst so many, they all thinke, they haue too lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.
<hi>Pallium breue est, vtrumque operire non potest, The cloake is short, and
cannot couer twaine.</hi> And for that the glorie of Tabor, was meant of that
other life, and for that it did discouer those that had beene dead for so many
yeares before, and for that it left euerie one so well satisfied, and made them
to acknowledge it as an immense and infinite blessing; it could not bee vnto
them a matter of Pride, or Enuy: Whence it commeth to passe, that in spirituall
goods, these vices are not found. Thou thy selfe obseruest, that such a
neighbour of thyne prayes deuout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, bestowes his almes liberally, fasts often,
repents heartily, and performes all other Christian duties willingly, and thou
bearest him no enuie at all: but if thou seest he is richer than thy selfe,
thriues better in the world, or is more esteemed amongst men than thy selfe,
his prosperitie is thy torment. Those that were the Spouses companions did
neuer enuie her happinesse, <hi>Viderunt eum filiae Syon, &amp;c. The Daughters
of Syon saw her, and proclaimed her blessed.</hi> These were goods of the
Soule, wherein if there were any enuie at all, it was in regard of that
estimation which followes the bodie. Thou wilt happely enuie the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, in

               <p>The one, That our Sauiour Christ liung amongst vs, was not onely
  seene of vs, himselfe seeing and knowing all things, but was happinesse it
  selfe.</p>
               <p>The other, That he was so from the verie instant of his
  conception.</p>
               <p>The third, That being happie in Soule, he must likewise be so in
  his body.</p>
               <p>The fourth, That the glorie of his Soule remained after that he
  had left his bodie.</p>
               <p>Touching the proofe of the first Truth, notable is that place of
  Saint <hi>Iohn, No man hath seene God at any time;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.</note> 
                  <hi>that onely begotten Sonne which is in
  the bosome of the Father, he hath declared him:</hi> The Glosse hath it, Who is
  neerest to his father, not onely in respect of his loue towards him, but by the
  bond of nature, and for the vnion or one-nesse that is betweene them, whereby
  the Father and the Son are one. God reuealed him and shewed him vnto vs;
  whereas before, hee was vnder the shadowes of the Law, so that the quickenesse
  of the sight of our mind was not able to perceiue him: for whosoeuer seeth him,
  seeth the Father also. The Euangelist pretendeth here to prooue, that onely our
  Sauiour Christ is the author of Grace and of Truth, and that neither
  <hi>Moses,</hi> nor any of the Patriarks could see God as he was himselfe,
  which is Truth it selfe by essence; but as he is the Sonne: and therefore he
  onely can be the author thereof. Men may see God in his creatures,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iob</hi> 36. <hi>Romans</hi> 1.</note> and know many of his
  perfections: And in this sence <hi>Iob</hi> said, <hi>All men see him and
  behold him afarre off.</hi> Saint <hi>Gregorie</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
  implie as much, <hi>For the inuisible things of him, that is, his eternall
  power and Godhead, are seene by the creation of the world, considered in his
  workes.</hi> Men may likewise see him in some image or figure, sometimes of a
  man, sometimes of an Angell, sometimes of Fire, representing himselfe in those
  formes; sometimes by the eyes of the Soule, and sometimes those of the Bodie.
  So <hi>Esay</hi> saw him, <hi>I saw the Lord sitting vpon an high Throne.</hi>
  And <hi>Iacob, I saw the Lord face to face.</hi> Thirdly, God may be seene by
  Faith,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Esay</hi> 6. <hi>Gen.</hi> 29. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi>
 13.</note> as the Faithfull now see him, <hi>Now, we see through a glasse
  darkely.</hi> Fourthly, in his humanitie, <hi>Afterward he was seene vpon
  earth,</hi> (saith <hi>Buruch</hi>) and dwelt among men. Fiftly, in himselfe,
  and in his essence, not in his creatures, not in his image, not in his
  humanitie, but in himselfe, <hi>Sicuti est, As hee is.</hi> This sight is so
  farre aboue all the rest, that it makes men happie, as also the Angels.
  Moreouer,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.</note> Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> saith,
  That with a cleere sight (at least comprehensible) no man euer yet saw God, but
  by the Sonne. And being, that God is our happines, when he is cleerely seene,
  it followeth, that our Sauiour Christ is happie. The selfe same argument our
  Sauiour vsed to <hi>Nicodemus, No man ascended to Heauen, <pb n="185" facs="tcp:22083:102"/> but he which descended from Heauen, the Sonne of Man, who is in
  Heauen.</hi> Ye will not giue credit to these earthly things, how will yee
  credit those then that are heauenly: And condemning this their incredulitie, he
  saith, <hi>No man ascended vp into Heauen.</hi> There is not any man that can
  make true report of the things that are there, because no man hath ascended
  thither to see them: only I, who liued in Heauen, and descended downe from
  Heauen, am able to tell ye the things that are in Heauen. Our being in Heauen
  then being all one with the seeing of God, and the seeing of God beeing our
  happinesse, it followeth that our Sauiour Christ is happie.</p>
               <p>The second Truth, That he was so from that verie time that hee
  first tooke our nature vpon him; Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> collects it out of
  the sixtie fift <hi>Psalm, Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed is the Man whom thou chusest and receiuest
  vnto thee, he shall dwell in thy Court, and shall be satisfied with the
  pleasure of thy house, &amp;c.</hi> The same <hi>Eusebius Caesariensis</hi>
  in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth vpon the twentie second <hi>Psalme, Thou art hee that tooke me out
  of my mothers wombe</hi>; or (as the Chaldee letter hath it) <hi>Leuaui me in
  robore tuo,</hi> I got vp to bee ioyned equall with God. Which testimonies of
  Scripture are confirmed by all your Scholasticall Doctors.</p>
               <p>The third Truth, That our Sauior Christ must needs be happie
  both in soule and in bodie. <hi>Iohannes Damascenus</hi> prooues it out of that
  strict vnion of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie, which Death it selfe cannot vndoe. Saint
  <hi>Augustine</hi> affirmes, That the glorie of the soule is naturally conueyed
  to the bodie, as the light of a candle to a paine of glasse.</p>
               <p>The fourth Truth, That our Sauior Christ was transfigured by
  giuing licence to the glorie of his soule, that it should transferre it selfe
  to the bodie: not that glorie which he was able to giue it, but that which his
  Disciples eyes were able to endure; as it is noted by Saint
  <hi>Chrysostome</hi> treating on this point.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Et transfiguratus est.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>And he was transfigured.</hi> We haue elsewhere set downe
  the causes of our Sauiours transfiguration; but none so often repeated by the
  Saints and Doctors, as his discouering thereby the hidden treasures of his
  glorie, as the reward that calls vnto vs, and stayes for vs, haling as it were
  our thoughts and hopes after it. Such is the condition of man, that commonly he
  makes interest and priuat gain, the North-starre of his labours and endeauours;
  this he thinkes on, dreames of, and adores. But as to the Worldling the worlds
  wealth is his North-starre; so the North-starre of the Sonne of God, is the
  glorie of God. Now our Sauiour Christ discouereth vnto vs a streake or a line,
  as it were, of that happinesse, which though it doth not fully expresse vnto vs
  what God is, yet it remooueth from vs all those difficulties which might diuert
  vs from his seruice. And therfore Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith, <hi>Ne quis
  frangatur, &amp;c.</hi> He allureth our mind with this so soueraign a good,
  that the troubles of this life may not disquiet it, nor driue it to despaire.
  So furious are the tempests of this Sea, so raging the waues and tossings too
  and fro of this life, that if God did not temper the distasts thereof with the
  hope of another life, our life were but a Hell. Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> saith,
  That the end which our Sauiour had in transfiguring himselfe, was, that we
  might settle our thoughts and our hopes on that glorie whereunto he inuiteth
  vs; for that, mans happinesse wholly consisteth in enioying the presence of
  God. Saint <hi>Basil</hi> expounding that place of Saint <hi>Mathew, Estote
  perfecti, &amp;c. Be yee perfect euen as your Father is perfect</hi>; saith,
  That the plainest way to enioy God, is, to thinke so continually on him, that
  our Soules should be translated, as it were, into himselfe; wee playing 
  <pb n="186" facs="tcp:22083:103"/> therein the Painters, who for to take a picture
  perfectly, neuer haue their eye from off the originall. Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi>
  saith, That there is not any thing that doth so much glad the eyes of God, as
  our thinking on the reward which is set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vs. Many Saints turmoyled with
  a thousand miseries, did euermore liue me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, by being onely cheered vp with
  these good thoughts and hopes. <hi>Salomon</hi> tells vs, <hi>A reward is as a
  stone pleasant in the eyes of them that haue it</hi>: Nor is there any pretious
  stone that so gladdeth his possessour,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Prou.</hi>
 17.</note> as hope cheereth the Righteous. <hi>Gregorie Nissen</hi> calleth
  Affliction, the Floure of Glorie; <hi>Fructu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, qui sperantur flos,</hi> As he
  that is to eat of the fruit, takes pleasure in the floure, for that
  neighbouring hope which is neere at hand; so, the Righteous through hope
  reioyce in Affliction. Our Sauiour therefore being desirous that we should liue
  in hope, vnfolded part of that Glorie which he retained in his Soule, that
  placing our eyes and hearts thereupon, all troubles whatsoeuer, though neuer so
  great, might seeme little in regard of our hoped-for reward.</p>
               <p>Hence it followeth, how ill they proceed, and what a desperate
  and indirect course they take, to whom God hauing deputed the Earth for their
  hopes, and Heauen for their blisse, peruert this his order, by making the Earth
  their Heauen. It is an ordinarie phrase of speech in Scripture, to call our
  life, a Warrefare; now souldiers that are wise and valiant, reuerse their
  pleasures till the battell is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and the victorie obtained. <hi>De torrente
  in via bibit, propterea exaltauit caput, He dranke of the torrent by the way,
  therefore hath hee lift vp his head.</hi> Saint <hi>Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome</hi>
  expoundeth this verse of our Sauiour, <hi>Qui non acquieuit in diebus carnis
  sua, Who rested not in the dayes of his flesh,</hi> vntill he had ouercome
  Death and Hel. Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> declaring that place of the Apostle,
  <hi>Non est nobis colluctatio, &amp;c.</hi> Wee fight (saith he) with the
  Princes of Darkenesse, for coelestiall goods, for they loosing them by our
  occasion, they are vnwilling that wee should enioy them. And because Reward is
  that which giues the Souldier both heart and hands, the last Sonday, we
  proposed the Warre; this; the Reward. The Deuill offered our Sauiour the glorie
  of the World; but our Sauiour offers vs the glorie of God: the hopes of this
  are better than the enioying of that. Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> saith, That the
  time of this life is the vigil of that feast which we hope for in glory: whence
  he inferreth these two things:</p>
               <p>The one; That it were folly in vs, to make the Vigile, the
  Feast. Which is all one with that of S. <hi>Austen; Summa peruersitas est, vti
  fruendis, &amp; frui vtendis.</hi> It is no good chop, considering the
  vnequalnesse of the tearmes. God gaue vs the Earth, that we might vse it;
  Heauen, that we might inioy it. And it is a beastly kind of ignorance, to make
  the Earth Heauen.</p>
               <p>The other; That the Feast beeing so great, the fast of the
  Vigile, ought not to seeme so long vnto vs. Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> making a
  counter position ofthat, which may be suffered heere; and that which may be
  hoped for there: after that hee had sayd, that the one was light and momentary;
  the other weightie, &amp; perdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, he added, <hi>Supra modum in
  sublimitate.</hi> It is a highnes aboue all highnesse; the altitude thereof
  alone cannot be taken: Nor can the tongue of man indeare it so much, but it
  must fall short therof. This made Saint <hi>Gregorie</hi> to say, <hi>Qua
  lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gua, &amp;c. What tongue, or what vnderstanding is able to vtter the great
  and wonderfull ioyes of that coelestiall Citie?</hi>

  in the old Testament offered vnto God. For, in sacrificing his son

  are the thoughts of that Prince, who keeping himselfe close in a Sheapheards
  cottage, shall deeme himselfe happie in that poore estate, not so much as once
  thinking on that crown, which he ought to hope for. Saint <hi>Austen</hi>

               <p>For this Light did ont only eclipse and darken that of the Sun,
  as that of many Torches doth a poore sorrie Candle; nor onely inrich the aire

  is not any thing that doth make the earth so fruitfull, as the Sun with his
  heat, and the Snow with it's moysture.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> in that Epistle of his to
  <hi>Palmachius,</hi> against the errors of <hi>Iohan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes Hierosolimitanus,</hi>
  saith, That not onely his face did shine, but all his whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die. Saint
  <hi>Austen, Quod caro illuminata, per vestimenta radiabat</hi>: For it was not
  fit (as <hi>Lyra</hi> hath it) that his garment should shine, and not his
  hands.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>His face shined like the Sunne.</hi> Who would haue
  thought,<note place="margin">The richest minds are v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually where the poorest
 meanes.</note> that behind so poore a vaile there should bee found such great
  treasure? But it passeth so likewise in this world, that he that seemeth most
  poore, is oftentimes most rich; and he that seemeth most rich, is most poore.
  The greatnesse of Rome Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> painteth forth in the forme of a
  woman clothed in Purple, bedecked with pretious stones, and in her hand a sprig
  of Gold; but that which did not appeare to the eyes, was all abhomination,
  filthinesse, and beastlinesse. The Altars of Aegypt were euery one of them a
  Treasure-house of Pearles, pretious Stones, Gold, Iewells, and Silkes; but in
  euerie one of these their Altars they had a Toad or a Serpent. The Mezquita or
  Turkish Temple that honoureth the bones or Reliques of <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,</hi> is
  stored with that infinite riches, that you would take him to be some great God,
  whereas indeed he is but <hi>vn çancarron de vn puerco,</hi> but the
  withered leg of a Hog, a base borne fellow, and of no worth in the world. The
  Idols of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, though neuer so much gilded ouer with Gold, are no
  better than stockes and stones. One said in the <hi>Apocalyps, I am rich, and
  stand in need of nothing</hi>: But it was answered him from Heauen, <hi>Thou
  art poore, and much to be pittied.</hi> These are ordinarily the stampes of
  your powerfull persons and great Princes of this world, that seeming to be as
  bright as the Sunne in their bodies, are as blacke as a cole in their soules.
  But those that are the Saints of God, carrying a besmee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red countenance, and a

               <p>
                  <hi>And behold, Moses and Elias appeared.</hi> On <hi>Moses</hi>
  his part there is a strong rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. Amongst the Assei, it was a receiued
  opinion, (which those now follow, whom wee call Atheists) That the Soules did
  die together with the bodies: And it seemeth that <hi>Cicero</hi> did fauour
  the same, when he said in his <hi>Amicitia, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut in morte nihil est boni, sic
  certè nihil est mali, As there is no good, so there is no hurt in
  death.</hi> That couetous rich man in the Gospell was surely of this opinion in
  <pb n="190" facs="tcp:22083:105"/> his life time; but being put out of this his errour, in
  that other life, he present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly desired <hi>Abraham</hi> to send one in all hast
  from the dead, to preach vnto his kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, that they might forsake this their
  errour: but hee receiued this short an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, <hi>Habent Moysen &amp; Prophetas,
  They haue Moses and the Prophets.</hi> Where there is Scripture, there is no
  need of miracles: And Saint <hi>Peter</hi> saith, That Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie hath more
  assurance in it than the euidence of miracles. This is a truth hard to be
  vnderstood.</p>
               <p>First, Because a miracle (as Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> saith) is,
  as it were, the Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Seale; and the Apostles did confirme their Faith
  by miracles: and those mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles that were prophecied of our Sauiour Christ
  heretofore, did declare him to be the Sonne of God. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi>
  treating at large vpon this place, saith, That Prophecies and Miracles haue one
  and the selfe same certitude, because they proceed from one and the selfe same
  God: but that Prophecie is the stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and more forcible of the two; for a
  Miracle may bee found fault withall, as the Pharisees did with that Miracle of
  him that was possessed with a Deuil, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling our Sauiour, <hi>In Belzebub the
  Prince of Deuills thou doost cast out Deuills.</hi> And that same Pythonisse,
  made the Deuill to appeare in the forme of <hi>Samuel</hi>: But
  <hi>Abraham</hi> tells <hi>Diues, They haue Moses and the Prophets.</hi> And no
  man can taxe the Scripture, or challenge it of any fault.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> askes the question, Why he did not
  fetch some of the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned out of Hell?</p>
               <p>First of all, he answereth thereunto, That we haue many pictures
  of Hel in this life; but of Heauen, very few: For although that the World be,
  as it were, the <hi>Entresuelo,</hi> or middle roome of these two extreames,
  Heauen, and Hell; yet more are the fumes &amp; vapours that ascend vp from
  beneath, than those <hi>gustos,</hi> &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents which descend from aboue.
  There were a sort of Heretickes that denied there was a Hell; it seeming vnto
  them, that the life of a Sinner was a Hell of it selfe, and that it stood not
  with Gods mercie, that there should be two Hels; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging that of <hi>Nahum,
  Godiudgeth not one and the same thing twice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, God to many of his friends discouered the torments of
  Hell, and many of his enemies haue beene visibly snatcht away thither. And
  those <hi>Aet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na's</hi> of fire which are in the world, though happely
  engendred by particular cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, are, as it were, symboles, representing vnto
  vs that eternall fire.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">God labors to conceale, both his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and
 pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments.</note>Thirdly, It is an vsuall fashion with God, to discouer the
  reward, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale the chastisement, for that man would bee ashamed that
  others should see him punished. God did shut the port of <hi>Noahs</hi> Arke
  without, and hung the key at his owne girdle, because hee should not haue any
  desire to see that lamentable deluge, and generall destruction of mankind. He
  charged <hi>Lots</hi> wife, that shee should not so much as looke towards
  Sodome, that she might not behold those flames which did voice out Gods
  vengeance. At the end of the world, at that dreadfull day of judgement, when
  God shall shew himselfe most angrie, the Sun and the Moone shall be darkened,
  because God will haue his chastisements infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in the darke.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Hope more Preuailent with man than
 Feare.</note>Fourthly, Hope doth worke more generous effects in our brests,
  than Feare. It cannot be denied, but that Feare hath verie powerfull effects:
  <hi>Herod</hi> for feare of loosing his Kingdome, made that butcherly slaughter
  of so many innocent Babes, not sparing his owne children. For feare of loosing
  his Citie, the King of Moab was his owne sonnes hangman, quitting him of his
  life vpon the wall. For feare of dying by the cruell hands of hunger, many
  mothers haue eaten the birth of their owne bowells. For feare least they should
  be made captiues, and <pb n="191" facs="tcp:22083:105"/> led in triumph by their enemies,
  many valiant men haue made an end of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. And for that Feare doth not
  onely extend it selfe to an absent good, as well as Hope, but likewise to a
  present; and for that to loose the present good which a man possesseth, causeth
  a greater sorrow, than to loose the good which we doe but hope for; it seemeth,
  that Feare is more powerfull than Hope.</p>
               <p>Yet notwithstanding all this, Antiquitie hath giuen the Palme to
  Hope; and the reasons on that side are verie cleere.</p>
               <p>The first, If Feare come to effect great things, it is by the
  helpe and fauor of Hope; for there cannot be any feare, without hope of
  escaping the ill or the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that is feared. Him whom the feare of some
  great hurt apprehendeth, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth choice to kill himselfe, that he may escape
  that harme.</p>
               <p>The second, <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Aristotle</hi> both affirme,
  That Delight is the authour of noble deeds and difficult enterprises. Whence
  the Phylosopher inferreth, That that thing cannot long continue, which wee doe
  not take delight in. Delight then being the child of Hope; and Sorrow, the
  sonne of Feare, Feare is lesse noble than Hope.</p>
               <p>The third, Loue and Hope carrie vs along as Prisoners, in their
  triumph, yet as free, vsing vs like noble persons. And as they lead vs along,
  so are we willing to goe with them: But Feare carrieth vs away Captiues, haling
  vs by the haire of the head, tugging and pulling vs as a Sergeant doth a poore
  Rogue, who goes with an ill will along with him, making all the resistance that
  he can. And for that Heauen consists wholly of noble persons, and that the
  condition of God is so noble, and the reward which he proposeth, so honourable,
  we should do him great wrong, to suffer our selues to be drawne by force to so
  superexcellent a good; howbeit, with those that haue hung backe, our Sauiour
  Christ hath vsed the threatnings and feares of Death, of Iudgement, and of
  Hell: And his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets &amp; Preachers are therin to follow his example. Those
  that are his children he still desireth to lead them in the triumph of Hope:
  And for this cause <hi>Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> cals them the prisoners of Hope,
  <hi>Turne yee to the strong Hold, ye prisoners of Hope.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith, That hee made choice of
  <hi>Elias</hi> and <hi>Moses,</hi> to shew,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Zach.</hi>
 9.</note> That in Gods House the Poore is as much respected as the Rich.
  <hi>Moses</hi> in his yonger yeares was a Prince of Aegypt; afterwards, the
  chiefe Commander and Leader of Gods People: <hi>Elias</hi> was alwayes poore,
  and halfe hunger-starued, cloathed with Goats haire; yet both these did enioy
  the glorie of Tabor. The like judgement may be made of <hi>Elizeus</hi> and
  <hi>Dauid,</hi> of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and of diuers
  others.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Luke</hi> addeth, <hi>Visi sunt in Maiestate, They
  were seene in State</hi>: For great was the Maiestie wherewith <hi>Elias</hi>
  and <hi>Moses</hi> appeared. And <hi>Tertullian</hi> saith, That they appeared
  glorious [<hi>In claritatis praerogati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>a</hi>;] So that those new Disciples, <hi>Peter, Iames,</hi> and
  <hi>Iohn,</hi> might, by seeing these his antient followers so happie, bee
  thereby the better encouraged, and hope to enioy the like happinesse.
  <hi>Origen</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius</hi> are of the same opinion.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Hierome,</hi> against <hi>Iouinianus</hi>; and
  <hi>Tertullian,</hi> in his booke <hi>De Iejunio,</hi> say, That <hi>Elias</hi>
  and <hi>Moses</hi> did fast fortie dayes, as well as our Sauiour Christ in the
  Wildernesse; and that therefore they seemed as glorious as himselfe. Whence
  they inferre, That hee that will bee transfigured with Christ, must fast with
  Christ.</p>

               <p>Touching that death which our Sauiour Christ was to suffer in
  Hierusalem, <pb n="192" facs="tcp:22083:106"/> there could not bee any conuersation more
  conformable to that estate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of his. For, beeing that our Sauiour
  was to merit the glorie of the body by his death, he could not so much reioyce
  in any thing, as in the brauenesse of that noble and renowned Action, and the
  worthinesse thereof. In Gods house, good seruices are much more esteemed, than
  recompence or reward: And more reckoning is made of deseruing honour, than
  inioying it. When those his Disciples desired such and such seates of honour,
  our Sauiour sayd vnto them; <hi>Potestis bibere calicem, &amp;c.</hi> In my
  Kingdome, more honourable is the Cuppe that I drinke of, than the chaire that
  ye would sit in. In our Sauiours Ascension, when hee came to Heauen-gates, the
  Angells beganne to wonder at his bloudie gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Esay</hi> 63.</note> 
                  <hi>Quis est iste, qui venit de Edom,
  tinctis vestibus de Bosra?</hi> In a place so free from sorrow and torment,
  such a deale of bloud, and woundes? But that which made their admiration the
  more, was, that hee should make this his <hi>Gala,</hi> the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gallant
  clothes, that he could put on. <hi>Formosus, in stola sua.</hi> And for that
  this his bloud, had beene the meanes of his taking possession of this glorie,
  both for himselfe, and for vs; he could not cloth himselfe richer, nor doe
  himselfe more honour, than to weare this bloudy roabe, that had beene dyed in
  the winepresse of his Passion. Saint <hi>Austen</hi> sayth, That the Prouidence
  of God had so dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed it, that the markes of the Martyres torments should not
  bee blotted out in Heauen. For albeit that happy estate doth repaire all manner
  of maimes, take away all deformities, and cleare all the spots, and blemishes
  of our body; and though they shall appeare much more glorious than the Sun; yet
  notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, those stigmata, and markes of their martyrdome, shall adde an
  accidentall glorie vnto them, as those colours that are gained in warre,
  beautifies his Coat who weares them in his scutchion.</p>
               <p>The Greekes read, <hi>Loquebantur de gloria, quam completurus
  erat, They spake of the glorie which hee was to fulfill.</hi> Our Sauiour
  Christ being vpon the Crosse, the Sunne was darkened (<hi>Tenebrae factae sunt
  super vniuersam terram</hi>) in token, that when Iesus Christ was crucified for
  our sinnes, there was no need of seeing the Sunne any more, nor any more
  Heauen, or glorie to be desired. In mount Tabor, Christ did not discouer all
  his glorie to the eyes of Faith, and therefore it was necessarie, that the
  Heauens should be opened, that a cloud should come downe, and a voice be heard
  from his Father, saying, <hi>Hic est filius meus dilectus, This is my beloued
  sonne.</hi> Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> expounding that place of Saint
  <hi>Iohn,</hi> sayth, <hi>Vidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus gloriam eius, quasi vnigeniti à

  our Sauiour Christ discouered on the Crosse; &amp; that there hee shewed, whose

  when hee sayd, God forbid (sayth hee) that I should be so foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish as to glorie
  in any thing, saue the glorie of the Crosse. And the Spouse, His Crosse, and
  his Ensignes, are to me as a bundle of Myrrh, I will beare it betweene my

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of waies.</note>Three manner of wayes may it bee taken, that this
  Excesse of our Sauiour Christ, is Glorie.</p>
               <p>The first, That his passion, and death, and the rest of those
  Excesses, which he did for our saluation, (for all these may bee termed
  Excesses) Christ did take them to be a glorie vnto him. <hi>Adam</hi> sinning,
  hee seemed to make little account of God, and his creatures, which in him was a
  great Excesse. But God did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie this Excesse with other infinite Excesses.
  Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> obserueth, That our Sauiour Christ would not enioy the
  Balme which the three <hi>Maries</hi> brought to annoint him after he was dead,
  but did reserue it for his liuing bodie: For in <pb n="193" facs="tcp:22083:106"/> Christ,
  wee are to consider two bodies: the one Naturall; the other Mystical<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
  which is the Church: And as hee left the first nayled and fastned to the Crosse
  for the second; so he left this Balsamum, for the annointing and curing of it:
  Which was a great Excesse. <hi>Dauid</hi> called him a Worme, a Scoffe, a
  Taunt, and the Reproch of the People; for that whilest he liued in the world,
  he tooke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him all the affronts and contempts that man could cast vpon him.
  And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is not any loue comparable to that of our Sauiour Christ,
  nor all the loues in the world put together, can make vp such a perfect loue;
  as also for that there was not any affront like vnto his, nor all the affronts
  of the world could equall the affronts that were offered vnto him; that on the
  one side hee should loue so much; on the other, suffer so much, this was a
  great Excesse. <hi>Nazian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen</hi> seeing vs swallowed vp in this sea of
  miseries, vseth a kind of Alchimie, by ioyning his greatnesse with our
  littlenesse; his powerfulnesse, with our weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; his fairenesse, with our
  foulenesse; his beautie, with our deformitie; his riches, with our pouertie;
  the gold of his Diuinitie, with the durt of our Flesh: And as the greater
  drawes the lesser after it; so our basenesse did ascend to an heigth of honour.
  And this was a great Excesse; but farre greater, to esteeme this Excesse as a
  Glorie: whence the Saints of God haue learned to stile Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and the
  Crosse, Glorie.</p>
               <p>Secondly, This Excesse may be termed Glorie, because it was the
  most glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious action that God euer did: For what could be greater, than to see
  Death subdued, Life restored, the Empire of sinne ouerthrowne, the Prince
  thereof dispossessed of his Throne, Iustice satisfied, the World redeemed, and
  Darknes made Light?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It may be said to be Glorie, because that by this his
  death a thousand Glories are to follow thereupon: <hi>Propter qoud &amp; Deus

  things in heauen, and things in earth, and things vnder the earth</hi>: And
  this was the reward of his obedience and of his death. And the reason thereof
  was, that the World seeing it selfe captiuated by so singular a benefit, men
  should make little reckoning either of their goods or their liues, for this his
  exceeding loue towards them, but desire in all that they can, to shew

                  <hi>hath no vnderstanding,</hi> saith,
  That the prosperitie wherein God placed man, robbed him of his vnderstanding,
  and made him like vnto the Beasts, that perish. And here now doth Saint
  <hi>Peter</hi> loose his memorie. Nor is this a thing so much to be wondred at;
  for if there be such riches here vpon earth, that they robbe a man of his
  vnderstanding, and alienate him from himselfe; if the sonne that is borne of a
  mother who hath suffered great paines in the bringing of him forth, <hi>Iam non
  meminit praessurae,</hi> hath forgotten his mothers throwes, and thinkes not on
  the wombe that bore him; if the great loue of this world, and the prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
  thereof, can make vs so farre to forget our selues; it is no strange thing,
  that we should be farre more transported and carried away with heauenly things.
  <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> following the pursuit of his pleasures, amidst all the delights
  of this life, he cries out, <hi>Onely thy glorie can fill me, that only can

  Transfiguration; and it may be that this Kingly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet did see it by the
  light of Prophecie. And if so fortunate a King as he was, did forget all those
  other goods that he enioyed, and saith, That hee desires no other good, nor no
  other fulnesse; What meruaile is it, that a poore Fisherman should bee
  forgetfull of good or ill? And as hee that is full fed likes nothing but what
  is the cause of this his fulnesse, reckoning all other meats soure, though they
  be neuer so sweet; so he that shall once come to tast of that good, will say,

  the world wanteth; and the ill which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digall endured; he did groane and

  <hi>Hierome</hi> treating of the raptures of his Spirit, saith, That he found
  himselfe many times among Quires of Angells; hee saith, That he liued a whole
  weeke without any sence of bodily necessitie: nor was it much, he enioying the
  conuersation of Angells, and the fellowship of God, <hi>Diuinae visionis
  intuitu:</hi> but when I came againe to my selfe, I did bewaile the good that I
  had lost. But that <hi>Peter</hi> may not groane with Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> nor
  weepe with Saint <hi>Hierome</hi>; knowing how the world went here beneath,
  said, Let vs not leaue that place which we may haue cause to weepe for, when we
  are once gone from it: For, what good is there vpon earth, be it neuer so good,
  which hath not <pb n="195" facs="tcp:22083:107"/> some ill with it's good? Obtaine (if thou
  canst) of God, that hee will but once giue thee leaue to tast of the goods of
  Heauen, and thou wilt soone forget what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer is on earth. The reason why
  these fraile &amp; transitorie goods are so much desired, and sought after with
  so great thirst and couetousnesse, is, because those eternall goods which call
  continually vnto vs, stand in so farre a distance from our hearts and our
  thoughts: for if thou shouldst but taste one drop of the water of that
  coelestiall Fountain, or but one crumme of that diuine Table, thou wouldst say
  with a full and resolute purpose, <hi>No mas mundo,</hi> Let the world goe, I
  will no more of it. The Hound when he neither sees nor sents his Game, goes
  slow and soft, diuerting himselfe here and there, as if hee had no life in him;

 Tabor</note> 
                  <hi>thou art in a mightie errour</hi>: First, In iudging that for
  a happinesse that was so short and transitorie; there being no felicitie but in
  things that are permanent. Immagine all possible happinesse, measure it with
  the duration of Ages, and with that time which in the end must end; and when it
  is ended, thou wilt hold it an vnhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and infelicitie. <hi>Peter,</hi>
  thou desirest to inioy glorie here in this world, which is to end toomorrow:
  And for that the glorie which thou desirest, is not to last so long as the
  world, nay scarce an houre in this world, thou art in a mightie errour,
  <hi>Peter.</hi> Saint <hi>Luke</hi> saith, That to the hungry bellie the
  remembrance of his forepassed fulnesse shal be a torment vnto him; and to the
  sorrowful, his former laughters and contentments shal but the more augment his
  griefe, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Secondly; <hi>Peter</hi> did erre, in preferring a particular,
  before a publicke good;<note place="margin">Publicke Good, euer to be preferred
 before the priuate.</note> especially, beeing a Prelat and Pastor of the
  Church. The hand and the foot, renouncing their proper right, offer themselues
  to incounter with any danger, for to defend the head, and saue the life.
  Amongst the Elements, the Water, the Earth, and the Ayre, forsake their Center
  for to assist common necessitie. A good Citisen must bee wanting to his owne
  house and person, for to further the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good. Saint <hi>Austen</hi> sayth,
  That Prelates must make profession of a double obligation: One, of Sheapheards,
  for their sheepe; another, of Christians, for themselues. For the first, they
  must haue recourse to the necessitie of their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, with a great deale of
  care and vigilancie. For the second, they are to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise themselues in all
  kind of vertue, and holinesse. But many of them, pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise the contrary. They
  are Christians for others, willing them to exercise themselues in vertue and
  holynesse; and Pastors for themselues, caring too much for their owne
  pleasures, and profit. The King of Sodome sayd vnto <hi>Abraham, Giue mee the
  persons, take the goods to thy selfe.</hi> Hee regarded more the freedome and
  libertie of his subiects, than the ransoming of his treasures. And howbeit hee
  was a bad man, yet hee shewed himselfe a good sheapheard. <hi>Dauid</hi> cried

                  </gap>e together, that God might be
  the better pleased therewith, and the sooner graunt his request.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Peter</hi> erred in his too too cold commendation
  of this Glorie, for the which a greater praise had beene insufficient.<note place="margin">To commend coldly that which is excel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lent, shewes a weake
 iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> Thou desirest a Painter to show thee a picture; He takes out
  one; thou desirest a better, hee takes out ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that contents thee not: At
  last he shewes thee the best that he hath; Thou coldly commendst it, and sayst,
  it is a pretie good peece, so, so: He growes wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of thee, and takes it away
  from thee. God made in the world diuers pictures, euery one of them beeing good
  apart; and all of them put together, exceeding good. Thou sayst, ô Lord,
  these doe not satisfie my desire; I would see the best peece that euer past
  through thy hands. He carryes thee vp to mount Tabor, hee there showes thee his
  master-peece, his Glorie? <hi>Peter</hi> giues it onely this cold commendation,
  <hi>Master it is good. Peter thou errest,</hi> sayth the Euangelist; <hi>For
  hee knew not what hee sayd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Peter</hi> did erre, in debasing so much that
  glorie, which had no need at all of any Tabernacles, or houses to defend them
  from the Sunne, &amp;c. For, as he did not thinke then vpon eating, so he might
  haue had as little mind of slee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping. Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> defines
  Happinesse, to bee, <hi>Omnia bona, in omni bono.</hi> Hee need not desire a
  Sunne to giue him light, because he inioyeth another Sunne, that neuer setteth;
  and another Moone, which neuer is in it's wane, or increase. <hi>Thou shalt
  haue no more Sunne, to shine by day</hi> (saith Esay) <hi>neither shall the
  lightnesse of the Moone shine vnto thee.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Esay</hi>
 60.</note> Thy Sunne shall neuer goe downe, neither shall thy Moone be hid. For
  the Lord shall bee thine euerlasting light, and the dayes of thy sorrow shall
  be ended. But here, our felicitie, is in the wane, and our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse suffers
  an eclipse. <hi>Neither is our light cleare,</hi> saith <hi>Saint</hi> Bernard,
  <hi>nor our ref<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

  our mansion safe</hi>: Cloudes, obscure it's light; hunger, marres it's
  fulnesse; and alterations, it's firmenesse, and security. <hi>Gregorie
  Nissen</hi> sayth, That, <hi>Necessitie brought in Rule and Dominion.</hi> For
  that there should bee a Lord and Ruler, there is a necessitie in it; And that
  there should be a greater Lord, there is a greater necessitie in it. For Man,
  had neede of the creatures, and God made him Lord ouer them. If a man could
  runne as fast as a horse, hee were not Lord ouer the horse; if he had the
  clawes, and strength of a lyon, hee were not Lord ouer the lyon; But in Heauen,
  there is not any the least signe of necessitie: for there both the Sunne, the
  Moone, the Creatures, Fountaines, Plants, Fruits, Flowers, and Houses are all
  superfluous. So that <hi>Peter</hi> when hee talkt of buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Tabernacles, he
  knew not what he sayd.</p>

               </p>
               <p>From the cloud, there went out a voice, like vnto thunder, which
  sayd, <hi>This is my beloued Sonne, heare him.</hi> And Saint
  <hi>Chrysostome</hi> hath noted it, That <hi>Moses,</hi> 
                  <pb n="197" facs="tcp:22083:108"/>
  and <hi>Elias</hi> disappeared, and were not to bee seene; to the end that the
  Disciples might vnderstand, that this voice was onely directed to our Sauiour
  Christ. Howbeit, hauing seene beefore in his face that treasure of glorie, and
  <hi>Peter</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing acknowledged him to bee the Sonne of the euerliuing God,
  in the name of the whole Colledge and Societie of the Apostles; it could not
  bee presumed otherwise.</p>
               <p>The voice beeing past, the cloud vanished, and the Disciples
  remained as dead men. Our Sauiour Christ quit them of their feare, and comming
  againe to themselues, like those that are awakened from a heauie sleepe, they
  saw none but onely Iesus in the garden. They were falne all asleepe, and they
  slept so soundly, that our Sauiour Christ could hardly wake them. Heere
  likewise they failed; for they awaked with an earnest desire to enioy that
  glorie which they had seene, but they did not see it any more. First, because
  those eyes that shut themselues to labour, do not deserue to see such glorie;
  Secondly, because vpon earth, (though it be from Heauen) no good can continue
  long. <hi>Thomas</hi> saith, That the body of our Sauiour Christ did inioy this
  glorie, as it were by transiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or a passing by; And that those glories,
  which are enioyed here on earth, are short &amp; momentarie, they are no better
  than grasse and hay, which are soone cut down &amp; withered, they are Winter
  Sun-shinesand Summer-Floods, soone gone. <hi>Mans dayes are like the grasse,
  and as the flowre of the field, so shall hee flourish.</hi> But that the glorie
  of God should stand vpon these ticklish tearmes, I cannot wel tell what to say
  to it; nor doe I know which is the greater miracle of the two, either that the
  glorie of the Earth should continue, or that of Heauen haue an end. But the
  truth is, those goods do not last long with vs, which Heauen it selfe
  commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicateth vnto vs. Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> sayth, That those pensions which
  God bestows on his friends, are verie good, but verie short. Saint
  <hi>Austen</hi>; That it is a sweete, but a short good, that God giues vs in
  this World. <hi>Hugo de Sancto Victore,</hi> That Gods <hi>Regalos,</hi> or
  <hi>Regales delitiae,</hi> haue two discountings, or diminutions of debt in
  this life: The one, that they are not full; the other, that they are not long,
  for a cloud presently comes and ouershadowes them. Saint <hi>Bernard</hi>
  treating of the cherishments and comforts of the Spouse, vnder the name of
  kisses, saith, <hi>Heu rara hora, &amp; parua mora</hi>; One while he saith,
  that he suffered his thoughts to be carried away with the sweetnes of these
  daintie delights, conceiuing it to bee a great happinesse; but then hee sayth
  againe, <hi>O, si durasset.</hi> Those that trauell abroad, reserue all their
  content they take therin, for their Countrie; so that their ioy shal not only
  be ful, but permanent, <hi>They shal be drunke with the plentifulnes,

  saith (And he applieth his mouth to that Fountaine from whence he drew all his
  happinesse;) <hi>Pro jucunditate sua sine fine, foelix; Happie, for the

               <p>Secondly, He inioyned them silence, for that the fauours and

  bring them vpon the stage in publique, or to proclaime them (as we say) at the

  time, when they shal make for thy honour, and his glorie. <hi>Elias</hi> was

  Tarrie here, I pray thee, for the Lord hath sent me to Bethel:</hi> But

  8.7.</note> in affront of their authoritie, our Sauiour had shewne to the
Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teresse, saying, <hi>Let him that is among you without sinne, cast the
first stone at her.</hi> They had made some threatning offers (as men that
thought themselues much wronged by him) to take away his life; but because his
houre was not yet come, no man laid hands on him. Whereupon our Sauiour said
vnto them, <hi>Ego vado,</hi> Why seeke yee thus after my life, I goe my way, I
am he, whom willingly, and of myne owne accord offer my selfe vnto death; your
armes were not strong enough to hold me, if it were in my desire to make
resistance: but when I am dead yee shall seeke mee. For the Iewes vsed
continually to cal for their Messias, and did earnestly long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him,
expecting then his comming, when as hee was alreadie come: and for that this
hope of theirs was hopelesse, he saies vnto them, Yee shall die in your sinnes,
your death shall differ much from mine, for I shall goe one way, and you
another; <hi>Whither I goe, yee cannot come.</hi> Your inferiour Ministers did
presume, That our Sauiour out of a desperate humour would needs liue among the
Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, as hee that goes to Morocco to turne Moore; the Pharisees, they
thought that he would goe destroy himselfe; What meaneth this man to say,
Whither I goe, yee cannot come? Will he kill himselfe? Vnto which vnmannerly
speech our Sauiour replied, Yee are from beneath, I am from aboue; yee are of
this world, I am not of this world; I haue told yee alreadie, That except ye
beleeue that I am he, yee shall die in your sinnes, not onely in that of
incredulitie, but in <pb n="200" facs="tcp:22083:110"/> all those other which ye shall
commit: for without faith in him, who I am, there is no remission of

               <hi>I
goe my way, and yee shall seeke me.</hi> This phrase of speech our Sauior
Christ did often vse, to shew, That hee died meerely out of his owne proper
will and pleasure. <hi>O Lord</hi> (said <hi>Abraham</hi>) <hi>I shall be verie
willing to die without leauing any children behind me, seeing that thou wilt
haue it so. Eusebius Emisenus</hi> to this purpose expoundeth those words which
our Sauior vttered on the Crosse to his father, <hi>In manus tuas, Domine,
commendo Spiritum meum, Into thy hands, ô Lord, I commend my Spirit</hi>:
Now <hi>Commendare</hi> is all one with <hi>Ponere</hi>; I put not, ô
Lord, my soule into the hands of death, nor into those of my enemies; for
neither their whips, nor their thorns, nor their nayl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, nor their speare, were able to take my life from me,
if I had not bin willing to surrender it vp into thy hands. <hi>Seneca</hi>
saith, That a benefit consists not so much in the thing that is giuen, as the
good will where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it is giuen. And therfore when the gift is small, the
greatnesse of it must be measured according to the goodnesse of the will. The
death of our Sauiour Christ was the greatest benefit that euer the world
enioyed, but the willingnesse wherewith he laid downe his life for vs was farre
greater, <hi>Maiorem Charitatem, &amp;c. Greater loue hath no man, than this,
that a man layes downe his life for his friend.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But heare now the wofullest, the heauiest, and most lamentable
case that can possibly fall within the compasse of thy imagination; to wit,
That the death of his Sonne, which God promised to the world as a Sea of
mercies, as a Heauen of hopes, as a ransome of our slauerie, and as a
reparation of all our miseries, he should now giue it as a threatning to this
wretched and vnfortunate Nation: and how taking his leaue of his Disciples, in
that Sermon of his last Supper, with tender teares trickling down his eyes, and
with a great many other kind demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations of his loue, hee should make such
large promises vnto them after his death; one of the chiefest whereof was,
<hi>Let not your heart be troubled; for although I go from you,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Christs
  go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from vs, the greatest Curse.</note> 
               <hi>yet shall I still remain with
you; Lo, I am with you till the end of the world:</hi> yet he should say now to
the Pharisees, <hi>Ego vado, &amp; quaeretis me,</hi> I depart away from you,
neuer to see you more. O, what a cruell blow was this! O, what a sad departure
is this! how comfortlesse, and how hard to be endured? If from him that is
dangerously sicke the Physition shall goe his way, who is able to cure him; if
from the Thirstie the Fountaine shall flie from his lips, what is able to
quench his thirst; if from the Blind, the light; from the child, his father;
from the wife, her husband; from the souldier, his captaine; and from the
scholler, his master shall be taken away; of whom shall they seeke helpe?
<hi>Turne not away thy face,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iob</hi> 14.13.</note>
               <hi>neither decline from thy seruant. Iob</hi> held Hell lesse fearefull than
Gods displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure; O, that thou wouldst hide me (saith he) in the graue, that
thou wouldest keepe me secret vntill thy wrath be past. But <hi>Dauid</hi> held
it the greater harme of the two, that God should hide his face from him, Though
thou beest angrie with me, yet turne not thy face from me. The same
<hi>Iob</hi> saith, <hi>Why doost thou hide thy face,</hi> this is to vse me as
an enemie. <hi>Iacob</hi> wrestling with God, although hee saw hee was
displeased,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.</note> yet hee would not let
him goe till hee had blest him. O Lord, I will endure thine anger, but not
thine absence. By way of Hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bole S. <hi>Paul</hi> said to those of Ephesus,
<hi>Yee were without Christ, and without God in this world</hi>: Weighing
therein verie well with himselfe, what the world is, and what God is.</p>
            <p>What then, shall this his departure be eternall? It goes hard with
vs, when God shal threaten his going away, and we shall not haue the heart to
entreat him to stay. <hi>Ieremie</hi> lamenting his misfortunes, one while in
the name of his people, <pb n="201" facs="tcp:22083:110"/> that were carried away captiues
into Babylon; another while in his own proper person, as one that lay fast
fettered in yrons, making a relation of his sorrowes goes adding griefe vnto
griefe; <hi>He did put me in a darke Dungeon,</hi> he did shut mee vp as in a
graue amongst the Dead, <hi>He hath enclosed my wayes with hewen stone</hi>;
hee hath shut his windowes against me, hee hath not left mee a loope-hole to
looke out; hee hath clapt gyues and shackles on my feet; I put vp a Petition
vnto him, <hi>And he would not hearken vnto my prayer.</hi> Yet notwithstanding
all this, doe you but aske the Prophet, Whither God had then a purpose to
destroy him? and he will tell you, That it was the least of his thought: No,
these were the stripes of a father, that loues his child better than he loues
himselfe; who beats him, but with teares in his owne eyes. If God then be so
good and louing a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vnto vs, that he falls a weeping when hee giues vs
but a few jerkes, &amp; those with a gentle hand; How can he desire our
eternall punishment? <hi>The Lord will not vtterly cast vs off.</hi> That God
should for euer take his leaue of thee, the fault must be in thee, not in God;
<hi>Can God take away his kindnesse for euer?</hi> How can hee shut the gates
of his house against thee, who is still knocking at the doores of thy house?
<hi>Non in perpetuum triturabis triturans,</hi> saith <hi>Esay,</hi> If God doe
thresh thee as with a flaile, it is not because hee takes delight to bruise
thee with his threshing of thee, but that he may seuer the corne from the
chaffe, &amp;c. This our Sauiours threatning is full of mercie, full of loue;
for he would neuer haue said so often to the Iewes, <hi>Ego vado,</hi> if hee
had not desired that they should haue said againe vnto him, Do not thou go from
vs. If it be our Sauiours delight, to be amongst the children of men, how can
hee take pleasure in departing eternally from vs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Et quaeretis me,</hi> (i.) <hi>And yee shall seeke me.</hi>
This second threatning is more fearefull than the former; Yee shall seeke mee,
but yee shall not find me. In the pursuit of any kind of good whatsoeuer, hard
is that mans happe, who seeks and finds not; who calls, and receiues no answer;
who sues &amp; obtains not; who liues in hope, but sees no end of his hopes.
Our Sauior Christ lookt for a Figge on the Figge tree, and because he found
none there,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Math.</hi> 21.</note> his displeasure was
such, that he laid a seuere curse vpon it. Amongst those many feares of the
ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall judgement, Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> in his <hi>Apocalyps</hi> saith, Man
shall seeke after death,<note place="margin">Kindnes neg<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lected, turnes to
  hatred.</note> and shall not find it, though those find it too, that neuer
seeke after it. This is a great vnhappinesse; but when the businesse is betwixt
God and vs, it is a far more miserable misfortune, to seeke him, and not to
find him: not onely because they sometimes find him, who seeke not after him,
[<hi>Inuentus sum à non quaerenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus me, I am found of those that seeke
me not</hi>;] but also because any other good whatsotuer, a man may hate &amp;
abhor as a thing that is ill; <hi>Vae, qui dicitis bonum, m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lum, Wo be to you that call good,
euill</hi>; he that despaires of life, desires death, and counts it as a good.
But who can hate God, who doth naturally desire our hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse? But this
miserie yee draw vpon your selues, who by abhorring me, and persecuting me
(saith Saint <hi>Augustine</hi>) as an enemie of God, are driuen to seeke vnto
God, calling hourely vpon him for your Messias, with great anguish of heart,
and with teares in your eyes: but because yee haue refused that happinesse
which offered it selfe vnto you, and entred within your gates, but was
reiected; groping the walls like blind men at noone day, yee looke after a new
occasion of happinesse: but by how much the more yee shall desire a new
Messias, by so much the more shall yee persecute me, and those which shall
preach my Name throughout the world. And by how much the more yee shall
persecute me, so much the longer shall your errour remaine with yee, and ye
shall continue in this your wilfull stubbornenesse, till yee die in your
sinnes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="202" facs="tcp:22083:111"/>Hence I inferre, how dangerous a thing an
errour is, especially in point of our saluation; how dangerous, an ill
performed Confession, yet by vs reputed for good; how dangerous, a secure, but
vnsound conscience; how dangerous for a man to erre in his account in the
beginning; how dangerous, highly to offend God, and yet thinke that therein wee
doe him good seruice. A Moore killeth a Christian, and hee thinkes that hee
hath pleased God verie well in so doing: A Schismaticke throwes downe Images,
breakes glasse windowes, and defaces all carued faces, and thinkes that he
shewes therein a great deale of zealous respect and reuerence vnto God: The Iew
hates the name of Christ, and persecuteth him that takes it in his mouth;
<hi>And he thinks that he doth an acceptable thing in Gods sight.</hi> O, what
a fearefull affronting of his errour will it be to the Moore, how shamefully
will hee see himselfe cosined, when he shall behold his <hi>Mahomet</hi>
bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in Hell flames? To the Iew, to see Christ our Sauiour come with the
Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie and glorie of God, to iudge the taunts and scoffes, and other
cruelties which they vsed towards him? To the Heretickes, to see the Saints
whom they haue burned, to sit as Assistants at their condemnation? Then will
they cry out when it will be too late, <hi>Erau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>mus in via veritatis, We haue erred in the way of truth.</hi> And
if a man shall then see, that hee hath lost fiftie yeares of good workes, of
Prayers, Almes, Fastings, wherewith he thought to gaine and merit Heauen; O,
how lamentable will that losse appeare, when hee shall find that by them hee
hath treasured vp more wrath against the day of vengeance, more sorrow and more
torment in Hell?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quaeretis me, Yee shall seeke me.</hi> In the former Chapter
hee added, <hi>Non inu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nietis, Yee
shall not find me. Ieremie</hi> hath the same; and the reasons thereof are
two:</p>
            <p>The first, Because he that seeketh sloathfully &amp; carelessely,
sildome or neuer findeth. From the time that our Sauiour Christ was borne, hee
condemned this their sloathfulnesse. The Kings came from the East to seeke him;
but the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees would not step a foot out of doores to looke after him, not
hauing the light of one single Starre, but of a thousand Prophecies. <hi>In
lapide luteo lapidatu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> est piger,
stercore bonum lapidatus est piger:</hi> The Greeke letter makes the sence more
plaine; for in stead of <hi>Lapidatus,</hi> it reads <hi>Comparatus.</hi> A
sloathfull man is compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to a durtie stone, or to the dung of an Oxe;
vnderstanding by these two, any kind of loathsome filthinesse whatsoeuer, which
the hand of man will auoyd to touch, which if it doe touch, it is besmeered and
fouled therewith. The sloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full man is no lesse odious; for he that shall
giue himselfe ouer vnto sloath, shall be bemired in his wealth or in his
honour, and shal haue cause all the days of his life to weepe and
complaine.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Signes wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to know whether wee seeke God
  truly. <hi>Iames</hi> 4.5.</note>Two signes the Scripture sets downe of him
that seekes God truly:</p>
            <p>The one, That hee seekes as earnestly to serue him, as others
desire to offend him. <hi>The Spirit that dwelleth in you, lusteth to
enuie.</hi> The Spirit is here taken in the better sence, as appeareth by the
Greeke Translation, as also by that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, <hi>But he giueth more
grace.</hi> He saith then, That the holy Ghost doth put enuie into our brests,
binding euerie Soule to labour for his saluation with enuie. Saint
<hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Spiritus sanctus postulat pro nobis gemitibus
inenarrabilibus</hi>; That is, He makes vs to desire it with groanes.<note place="margin">A godly kind of Enuie.</note> So likewise, he makes vs to desire
our sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation with enuie; that wee should haue the enuie of the worldly minded
man, and the care of the Theefe, when hee goes about his thefts and his
robberies. The beastly Epicure hotly pursues his filthie pleasures; the
reuengeful man, his reuenge. <hi>Demosthenes</hi> did enuie a Smith that was
his neighbour, for that he rose vp so early to so base and foule an Occupation.
The Theefe watcheth all night <pb n="203" facs="tcp:22083:111"/> to take a purse vpon the
highway; the Wanton waits nights and dayes at his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresses window; the
reuengefull man will not slumber nor sleepe: with the like care art thou to
seeke after God.</p>
            <p>The other signe, If when thou seekest God thou meetest not with
rest &amp; qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etnesse, it is a signe that thou hast not yet found him. As the
Needle rests in the North, so our Soule rests in God; <hi>Fecisti
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>os Domine ad te, &amp; inquietum

<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e,</hi> We cannot haue our perfect
rest and quiet in this life; but he that doth enioy the same, he hath it from
God, it comes from him. But when our heart is troubled, suffering continuall
perturbations, like the Needle in the Compasse, till it be turned towards the
North; it is no good signe, that wee haue found God as we should.</p>
            <p>The second reason of thy not finding God, is, because thou doost
not seeke him when he is to be found. <hi>Esay</hi> preaching before
<hi>Manasses,</hi> said, <hi>Seeke yee the Lord while hee may bee found, call
yee vpon him while hee is neere</hi>:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Esay</hi>
  55.</note> but this peruerse King, as the Hebrewes report it, did calumniate
this his doctrine; alledging, That it was a great error in him, to say, that
God could not at any time be found, being that <hi>Moses</hi> had said,
<hi>What Nation is there so great,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Deut.</hi>
  4.7.</note> 
               <hi>that hath their Gods so nigh vnto them, as the Lord our God is
in all things that we call vpon him for?</hi> But the truth is, That as there
is a time for all things, [<hi>Omnia tempus habent</hi>] so is there a time
likewise to find God, and a time not to find him: the time that wee liue heere
vpon Earth, is no ill time for to find him. For though in the Ages of man there
is one time better than another, none is so desperate and hopelesse but that he
may bee found therein; and of all the whole life of man it may bee verified,
<hi>Omnis qui quaerit, inuenit, Euerie one finds that seekes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the point of death it is no good time to seeke him; not that
hee that shall then truly seeke after him shall not find him; but because it is
a hard matter at that verie instant to performe true repentance, as wee haue
elsewhere declared. And therefore the Scripture so often cries out vnto vs,
That yet while it is day we should hearken vnto him, lest the night of death
should suddenly ouertake vs. What saith <hi>Eccl. Ante mortem confiteri,</hi>
i. <hi>Confesse before thou die.</hi> S. <hi>Austen</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds this place
of confession of our sinnes. And because no man should hope to do it in the
time of his sicknesse, when paines &amp; diuers other accidents diuert the
Soule; <hi>Eccles.</hi> addeth, <hi>Viuus &amp; sanus, &amp;c.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Confession of sinne when to be made.</note> 
               <hi>Confesse thy selfe
whilest thou art healthie and sound, not when thou art halfe dead; and therein
shalt thou doe two notable things</hi>:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The one, Thou shalt praise God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The other, Thou shalt glorie in his mercies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After death, is a desperate time; for then the doore is shut to
Confession, to Repentance, to Intercessions, and to pardon: <hi>A mortuo, quasi
nihil perijt confessio,</hi> Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> reads it, <hi>Quasi non
sit</hi>; the Greeke letter, <hi>Tanquam à non existente.</hi> When a
mans life ends, there is an end of all remedies: And therefore <hi>Salomon</hi>
said, That a liuing Dog was better than a dead Lyon: And <hi>Ieremie,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Eccle.</hi> 9. <hi>Ier.</hi> 13.</note> 
               <hi>Giue glorie to the
Lord your God, before he cause darkenesse, and before your feet stumble vpon
the darke mountaines</hi>; and while yee looke for light, yee turne it into the
shadow of death, and make it grosse darkenesse.</p>
            <p>A third reason why we doe not find God, is, because wee doe not
perseuer in seeking him: And therefore it is said, <hi>Yee shall seeke me, and
shall not find me.</hi> S <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten</hi> sayes, That the Iewes did seeke
after God three manner of wayes:</p>
            <p>One, By hoping after another Messias.</p>
            <p>Another, By persecuting him both in his life and in his death: For
that pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of his bodie with a Speare, did plainely proue now that he was
dead, what <pb n="202" facs="tcp:22083:112"/> hatred they bore to him while he was
aliue.</p>
            <p>The third, when they being besieged by <hi>Titus</hi> and
<hi>Vespasian,</hi> calling to mind, that he had foretold them, there should
not be one stone left vpon another in Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem, many of them returned to our
Sauiour Christ, and sought after him; but with a very poore &amp; weake
purpose: They did inherit this euil condition of their forefathers, and
grandfathers of old, who did neuer seeke God, but when hee scourged them
soundly for their sins: And when that storme was past, and their peace made,
they fell afresh to their former rebellions. There are few men so past grace,
which doe not sometimes sigh for Heauen. But the mischiefe of it is, that these
our sighes are quickly ouerblowne, they doe not last with vs. In the darkest
night, there are some lightnings which breake through the clouds and cleare the
ayre; but in the end the darkenesse preuaileth. In your duskiest &amp;
cloudiest daies, the Sun is woont to rush through the foggiest &amp; thickest
clouds; but new cloudes arising, the Sunne retires himselfe and pulls in his
head. <hi>Saul</hi> by spurts did dart foorth many beames of light,
acknowledging that <hi>Dauid</hi> had done him many reall courtesies, and that
he had repayed him euill for good, and had a purpose with himselfe vpon fits to
fauor him, and to honour him; But the foggy clouds and mystie vapours of Enuy
increasing more and more vpon him, these light flashes were turned into
darkenesse. <hi>Balaam,</hi> when King <hi>Balack</hi> sent vnto him to curse
Gods people, had verie good purposes and desires for a while within him; He
consulted with God in that businesse, and knowing that it was his wil, that he
should not go, dispatched those his messengers. And the King sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding others
vnto him, he told them, That he would not go to that end, if hee would giue him
his house full of gold. Doubtlesse, these were good intensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, had he
continued still in the same mind. But the clouds of couetousnesse did ouercast
this light of his vnderstanding with so grosse a darkenesse, that neither the
Angel which stood before him with a naked sword in the way, nor his beast which
spake vnto him, and turned aside, could keepe him backe.</p>

  &amp; to the end that the good old man should haue the best secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie he could

  will be content to be condemned to all possible miseries whatsoeuer. The like
  <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sabe</hi> was willing to say, when she thought the raigne of her sonne
  <hi>Salomon</hi> should <pb n="205" facs="tcp:22083:112"/> be troubled. <hi>Shall I and my
  sonne</hi> Salomon <hi>bee counted Offenders?</hi> Shall wee bee the out-casts
  of the world, and be layd open to the vtmost of miserie? The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of all
  this harme, is, For that all possible ill, that can be imagined, is reduced
  vnto sinne, as to it's Center. Make a muster of all the enemies of Man, as
  Death, the Deuill, the World, &amp; the Flesh; &amp; not any one of them, nay
  not all of them together haue any the least power to hurt vs without sinne. And
  therefore in our Lords prayer, silencing all other our enemies, only we beg of
  God, that he would free vs from sinne. <hi>But deliuer vs from euill.</hi>
  Which, howbeit some doe vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it to be spoken of the Deuill, yet (as
  Saint <hi>Austen</hi> sayth) he can but barke, he cannot bite. Onely sinne is
  able to doe both.</p>
               <p>To this so great a hurt, may be added another that is farre
  greater.<note place="margin">Obstinacie in sin, neuer to be cured.</note> Which
  is obstinacie in sinne. <hi>Iob</hi> painting out this euill, sayth, That the
  sinner taketh plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure therein, and that it seemeth sweet vnto him, it is as
  pellets of Sugar to him vnder his tongue; He first delights in the companie of
  sinne, then hee mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries himselfe vnto her, and at last, leaues her not till
  death them depart. <hi>Parcet illi, &amp; non derelinquet.</hi> The seuentie
  read it, <hi>Non parcet illi, &amp; non derelinquet,</hi> hee will excuse no
  occasion, no diligence, no trouble. His desire thereof is insatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. There is
  no kind of sinne (be it of Sloath, or Reuenge, or Couetousnesse) that is
  continually beating vpon our actions. But our thoughts are euermore hammering
  of wickednesse, like the Smith, that giues a hundred blowes vpon his Anuill,
  and two vpon his yron; or like the Barbar, that makes more snips in the ayre,
  than on the haire.</p>
               <p>The Pharisees did crucifie our Sauiour Christ but once,<note place="margin">Sin, desirous to doe more than it is able.</note> in the verie
  deed and act of his death; but in their desires, &amp; in their thoughts, they
  had crucified him a thousand times.</p>
               <p>But that we may giue the obstinacie of this people, it's full
  qualification, we must make a briefe recapitulation of those meanes, which God
  vsed for to mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie their hardnesse.</p>
               <p>First of all; he tooke it to his charge to cure it with his
  Doctrine, his Miracles, and the Prophecies of their Prophets. Well, this would
  doe no good with them, and many dyed in this their obstinacie. Next, he comes
  amongst them in his owne person, taking vpon him the name and office of a
  Phisition, <hi>Purgatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem peccatorum faciens, Making a purge for sinne.</hi>
  He was willing to haue mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred Phisicke to the Iewes, and with the sweet and
  comfortable syrrop of his Word, to haue eased them of their griefes, and to
  haue cured all the infirmities of their bodies; as the sicke of the Palsey for
  eight and thirtie yeares together, the Blind that were borne blind, and such as
  were possessed with Deuils, and the like; Being willing also to haue cleansed
  their soules from all kind of vnclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: But at last hee was faine to giue
  them ouer, their diseases were growne so desperate, remitting them <hi>ad
  hospitalium incurabilium,</hi> as men without hope of recouerie. For, as in the
  body, there are some sickenesses so mortall, that though the sicke bee capable
  of health, yet the malignity of the humour, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the Phisition to despaire
  therof: So likewise in the soule, there are some diseases so mortall, that
  through the great malignity of them, and the sharpenesse of the humour, the
  heauenly Physition is out of heart of helping them, and quite discouraged from
  doing any good vpon them. And therefore sayth, <hi>Yee shall dye in your sinne.
  Ieremie</hi> maketh mention, that certaine Angells comming by Gods appointment
  to cure Babylon, after that they had applyed many medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines vnto her, they
  sayd, <hi>Wee would haue healed Babylon, but shee is not healed,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Esay</hi> 51.</note> 
                  <hi>let vs therefore forsake her,</hi>
  and euery one goe his way from her. Lo, the Lord of <pb n="206" facs="tcp:22083:113"/>
  Angells himselfe, and of all the Hosts of Heauen, comes vnto them, offers to
  cure them, by applying the Medicines of his Word and his Miracles; but they
  refuse to bee holpen, and so he leaues them amongst the Catalogue of the
  Incurable.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The prayer which Christ made for them vpon the Crosse,
  was a strange meanes; and though he then conuerted a Theefe, yet could he not
  con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert a Pharisee. Saint <hi>Stephen</hi> made the like prayer, <hi>Lay not
  this sinne, ô Lord, vnto their charge,</hi> Let not the sinne ofthis
  people be a sinne vnto death. In a word, the bloud of our Sauiour Christ
  softneth the hardnesse of stones, but mollifieth not the hearts of the
  Iewes.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, an occasion once lost, as it is seldome or neuer
  recouered, so is it or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily bewailed. <hi>Horace</hi> saith of Vertue, That
  hee that inioyes it, esteemes it not; but hauing lost it, enuies it. Of
  <hi>Herod, Iosephus</hi> reporteth, That he caused his wife to be put to death
  vpon a false accusation, and she was scarce cold, but that he pined away for
  her. <hi>Alexander</hi> killed <hi>Clitus,</hi> and wept ouer him when he had
  done. Athens exiled <hi>Socrates,</hi> &amp; afterwards repenting themselues
  there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, they erected his Statua, and banished his Accusers. <hi>Abimelec</hi>
  banished <hi>Isaac</hi> out of his Countrie, and afterwards went to seeke for
  him, &amp;c. Humane and diuine Histories are full of this truth: onely in the
  brests of the Pharisees this remorse and pittie could find no place: but hauing
  lost in Christ our Sauior, the happiest occasion that euer the world inioyed;
  yet such and so great was this their wilfull obstinacie, that they were so
  farre from weeping or bewailing ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his or their owne losse, that if they
  could catch him now againe aliue, they would crucifie him anew.</p>
               <p>Great obstinacies, great stiffenesse and stubbornenesse doth the
  Scripture men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;<note place="margin">The hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartednesse of the Iewes
 without a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallell. 3. <hi>Kings.</hi> 16</note> as that of the Gyants, which
  built the Tower of Babell; that of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> whom so many seuerall
  plagues could not vnharden; that of <hi>Saul, Ieroboam, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus,</hi> &amp;
  <hi>Herod Ascalonita</hi>; that of <hi>Elah</hi> and of <hi>Zimri,</hi> who
  went into the pallace of the Kings house, and burnt the Kings house ouer him
  with fire, and died. But none was like vnto that of this people, for their
  hardnes of heart hath now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued aboue 1600 yeares.</p>
               <p>Aboue all these harmes, there is one that is yet greater than
  the rest, which is this present threatning, <hi>Yee shall die in your
  sinne.</hi> Of all disasters that may befall vs, this is not only greater, but
  the summe of all the rest. How many businesses offer themselues vnto men in
  this life, though they bee of Empires and Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies, which will be but as it
  were accessorie vnto them, and not much trouble them, whither they succeed well
  or ill? But this is so precise a one, and so neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie, that he that loseth
  it, loseth all; and not onely all present good, but the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hope of euer
  recouering it againe. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> writing to those of Corinth, comes
  vpon them with an <hi>Obsecro, vt vestrum negotium agatis,</hi> i. <hi>I
  beseech you mind your owne businesse</hi>; your owne businesse, by an
  Antonomasia; for all the rest are <hi>aliena, others. Seneca</hi> in an Epistle
  that he writeth to <hi>Lucilius,</hi> saith, That a man spendeth part of his
  life in doing ill, and the greater part in vnprofitable things; and all his
  life, in not looking well what he doth: As, he that prayes without at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention;
  he that reads with a diuerted mind: if he would haue spoke like a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
  he might haue put them in mind of many, who spend all their life, or the
  greatest part thereof, by placing their thoughts vpon their end. At this marke
  did <hi>Dauid</hi> aime in many of his prayers.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Psal.</hi> 49.5.</note> 
                  <hi>Cassiodorus</hi> thus expoundeth
  that place of the fortie ninth <hi>Psalme, The iniquitie of my heeles shall
  compasse mee about.</hi> The head is <hi>Principium hominis,</hi> the verie
  life and first beginning of man; and the heele <pb n="207" facs="tcp:22083:113"/> is taken
  for the end and finall dissolution of man: And he saith, That his greatest care
  was the continuall remembrance of his end. He repeateth the like in many other
  of his <hi>Psalmes, Exurge Domine, ne repellas in finem, Arise Lord, put vs not
  off to the end. Vsque quo Domine obliuisceris me? How long wilt thou forget me,
  to the end? Lord let me know my end</hi>: I euer, ô Lord, had an eye to
  the perill and danger of my end. <hi>Take me not away in the middest of my

  happinesse or vnhappiness consists in it's arriuall at it's Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen; for it
  little importeth, to haue escaped this or that storme, vnlesse we come to land
  safely. It is not sufficient for a man to haue spent a great deale of money in

                  </note> seemeth to bee a plaine prophecie, that this

                     <hi>Sol.</hi>
                  </note> That this cannot be a reuelation, for two
  reasons:</p>
               <p>The one, Because the Pharisees did not beleeue; and in not
  giuing credit to our Sauiour Christ in the truth that hee vttered for their
  good, it is likely they would not beleeue those that he deliuered for their
  hurt.</p>
               <p>The other, For that our Sauiour Christ repeating the verie selfe
  same propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, made it conditionall, <hi>Vnlesse yee beleeue, yee shall die
  in your sinne</hi>; which was as it were a declaration of the former.</p>
               <p>In a word, Two were those things which our Sauiour Christ
  pretended:</p>
               <p>One, That they might beleeue, and not die in their sinne.</p>
               <p>The other, That they who now treated with him should die in
  their sinne:<note place="margin">Gods presci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence not the cause of mans
 Reprobation.</note> but so, that Christ our Sauiour should not be the cause of
  their damnation, but their owne incredulitie. For that which is spoken of
  before it come to passe, it is therfore spoken of, because it shal come to
  passe; but it shal not therfore come to passe, because it is spoken of: For the
  Diuine prescience or foreknowledge, though it aduise that which shall come to
  passe, yet it imposeth not any necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie that it shall come to passe. Saint
  <hi>Peter</hi> therefore did not denie Christ, because our Sauiour told him,
  that he should denie him. So that diuine knowledge not deceiuing it selfe in
  that which it prophecieth, imposeth no such necessitie that it should succeed,
  nor is it to be said to be the cause thereof.<note place="margin">

  caused me to erre; for he hath no need of the sinfull man: so that he there
  prooueth, that God is not the author of our sins, nor are our ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norances to be

  Say not, I went backe because of the Lord, hee supplanted mee; for God hath no

  judge, but to the thefts of the Theefe. God desires not any mans fall, or his
  death; for as God is happy without the just, so is he also without the wicked.
  The book of <hi>Wisedome</hi> treating, That God did not make death, nor

  Chaire, not onely because the Law did discend from the Mount, but because (as
  some Hebrewes haue it) he was the first legall Priest, and exercised that
  office before his brother <hi>Aaron. Abenezra</hi> stiles him, <hi>Sacerdos
  Sacerdotum, a Priest of Priests,</hi> for that he consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his brother
  <hi>Aaron,</hi> and receiued the offerings of the twelue Princes in the
  Tabernacle. <hi>Dauid</hi> likewise giues him the same name; <hi>Moses</hi> and
  <hi>Aaron</hi> among his Priests. <hi>Philon</hi> saith, That he was a King, a
  Lawgiuer, a Prophet, &amp; a Priest. <hi>Gregorie Nazianzen,</hi> Saint
  <hi>Augustine,</hi> and Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> jumpe together in that 
  <pb n="210" facs="tcp:22083:115"/> point. From <hi>Moses,</hi> God had preserued the
  Catholicke doctrine in the Prophets and other his Saints, til <hi>Simeons</hi>
  time, in whose days the Synagogue had it's end. The Scribes and Pharisees were
  a kind of people that had the command of that Kingdome. The Scribes did
  flourish in knowledge, so is it reported by <hi>Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius.</hi> Their
  obligation was two fold:</p>
               <p>The one, To propose the Law vnto the people, and to expound the
  hard pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Scripture; and for this reason they were called <hi>Lectores,
  Readers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The other, To be Iudges and Deciders of causes (as it appeareth
  by the <hi>Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles</hi>) betwixt Citisen and Citisen. The Pharisees did
  flourish in Religion, and were called Pharisees, of <hi>Phares,</hi> which
  signifies, a separation; for that they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued apart from the ordinarie and
  common course of life, &amp; did seuer themselues from other people, in a more
  especiall kind of obseruance. Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> doth set downe the first
  rising of these manner of men,<note place="margin">Christs do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
 by whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer it be vttered.</note> in whom the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances of sanctitie, and
  outward demonstrations of holinesse of life, were verie great and shew-glorious
  aboue the rest, and whose penitences (as <hi>Iosephus</hi> and
  <hi>Epiphanius</hi> report them) were verie sharpe, and verie publique; but
  farre greater was their hypocrisie, their ambition, their auarice, and
  vaine-glorie. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Sauiour Christ doth here deale so curstly with
  them, and vseth them with that sourenesse and bitternesse of words, that all
  this Chapter is nothing else but a seuere reprehension of the Scribes and
  Pharisees. And for that it is an ordinarie thing with the common people, to set
  his doctrine at naught, who leads a naughty life, [<hi>Cuius enim vita
  despicitur, necesse est vt predicatio contemnatur, Whose life is despised, his
  preaching must of necessitie be contemned</hi>] our Sauiour Christ in defence
  of the Catholicke Doctrine, said, <hi>Super, &amp;c. Vpon the Chaire of Moses,
  &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was the errour of some, That a mortall and deadly sinne
  depriueth the Pope of his Popedome: but this was condemned by the Constantine,
  Florentine, and Tridentine Councels; for neither doth the Doctrine thereby
  receiue any harm, nor the See loose it's Iurisdiction and authoritie. Which is
  no more than is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered by Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> in expounding that
  place of the fortie fourth <hi>Psalme, In stead of thy Fathers thou shalt haue
  Children. Beda,</hi> and <hi>Anacletus</hi> the Pope, both say, That to our
  Faith, is not onely hypothecated and ingaged the authoritie of Priest and
  Bishop; but that of our Sauiour Christ, that of the Apostles, and that of the
  seuentie two Disciples. But suppose that all these Ministers should haue
  sinned, yet the authoritie of our Sauiour Christ remains safe and sure.
  <hi>What matters it whither the Minister be bad, where the Lord is so
  good?</hi> How much more then in the Church ought wee not (as
  <hi>Tertullian</hi> saith) to qualifie Faith by the persons, but the persons by
  Faith. This Doctrine <hi>Iudas</hi> made good, by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing miracles, by preaching
  the Gospell, and by condemning him that did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it, as if he had
  reiected Christ himselfe. <hi>Cayphas</hi> doth likewise proue this point, who,
  as he was High-Priest, did determine that Decree which had already beene
  ordained in Heauen. The like president we haue in the Prophet <hi>Balaam,</hi>
  who though he went of purpose to curse Gods people, yet was forced whither he
  would or no, to blesse them. And the Scribes &amp; Pharisees being asked,
  <hi>Where our Sauiour should be borne</hi>; answered, <hi>In Bethlem of
  Iudaea.</hi> Those Bishops whom Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> reprehendeth and threatneth

  amongst many other, why the Church is called Heauen. And as no strange

               </p>
               <p>From whence I inferre two things:</p>
               <p>The one, That <hi>Moses</hi> his Chaire lost nothing of it's
  respect, through the Scribes and Pharisees vices, as Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi>
  hath obserued; nor likewise Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Chaire, by the lesse laudable
  life of those Bishops which succeeded him, (which is the maine drift and
  principall intent of this Gospell:) For (as Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> hath noted
  it) our Sauiour did not seeme to looke so much to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Sunne setting, as
  toward the Sun rising; to wit, towards the <hi>Cathedra</hi> or Chaire of the
  Iewes, as towards the <hi>Pontificium</hi> of the Christians; wherein there was
  to be Bishops, whose liues, although they should not alwayes happen to be holy,
  nor their workes and actions so good as they ought to be, yet their Doctrine
  and their Preaching should still bee warrantable. Some, seeing some Bishops
  lesse holy than they should be, haue multiplied Inuectiues, Satyres, and
  impudent and vnseemely Pasquills vpon them; not considering, that works that
  want their weight &amp; goodnesse, doe not condemne the Doctrine of Faith, nor
  weigh downe the ballance against the Chaire of the Church. And that our
  Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour himselfe did preuent this inconuenience, by saying, <hi>Super
  Cathedram Moysi, Vpon the Chaire of Moses.</hi> Of such great force and vertue
  is the Doctrine of this Chaire, that it did not much stand vpon setling the
  same vpon base and meane subiects: for the same was placed in the mouthes of
  rude and ignorant Fisher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, to the end that none should attribute the
  victorie to their owne naturall gifts, though neuer so good. So sometimes he
  puts this Chaire into the hands of sinnefull men, because thereby men may see,
  that the vertue is in the Sword, which is the Word of God, and not in the arme,
  that is but flesh.</p>

                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.</note> resisteth the Ordinance of God; for there
  is no power but of God: And therefore to contradict our Superiour, is to
  contradict God himselfe. And it was high time for the Apostle to broach this

                  <hi>How can yee being euill, speake good things?</hi> And this difficultie is

  against the Law. Saint <hi>Mathew</hi> reporteth, That they taught, It was

  threatned <hi>Moses</hi> with death, and made shew as if hee meant to kill him;
  <hi>Rupertus</hi> and <hi>Lyra</hi> are both of opinion, That it was for the
  neglect and carelesnesse which hee had committed in circumcising one of his
  children, in such a season, when as the Law did oblige him thereunto: And the
  fault was much more in <hi>Moses,</hi> than in any other ordinarie man, for
  that as a Law-giuer, he was to haue published this verie Law. But more to the
  matter is that reason which Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> rendreth; which is, That
  the Angells threatning of him was, for that he being to persuade the Hebrewes
  to goe out of Aegypt, and to take their wiues and childeren along with them,
  they might haue presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that he had one thing in his mouth, and another in
  his heart, and that his workes did not correspond with his words. Experience
  teacheth vs, That ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things which humane eloquence cannot persuade, example
  doth effect: for the way by words is about, and verie tedious; but that of
  example, short, and quickely rid. The earth will not follow the motion of the
  heauens, though yee preach vnto it neuer so much; but the Sheepe wil soone
  learne to follow the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of his Sheepheard. The Prophets are full of the
  complaints and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings which God poureth forth against the bad example of

  with their durtie feet: For, What is bad life, and good doctrine, but a foule
  foot in cleere water? Saint <hi>Gregorie</hi> declareth this place concerning
  such Prelats; Who hauing drunke themselues of the pure and cleere Fountaine of
  Truth, trouble the same by their euill workes and bad example, giuing occasion
  there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to these their sillie Sheepe, not to follow their doctrine, but to

                  <hi>Doe not as they doe.</hi> This, for his Disciples was a most
  necessarie lesson, but for the Pharisees, a most seuere reprehension. And a
  late Doctor hath obserued, That they beeing the most part Leuits and Priests,
  hee silenced the Priesthood, in token of the respect and reuerence that is due
  thereunto. Whereby such are condemned, who too lightly giue credit to the
  faults of the Clergie, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine themselues therewith; beeing that God
  himselfe giues them this caueat, <hi>Nolite tangere Christos meos, Touch not
  mine Annoynted.</hi> Wherein he doth not lay an Interdiction on their violent
  hands onely, or on their blasphemous tongues, either before their face, or
  behind their backes; but likewise on their jealousies and suspitions, and on
  their rash censures, and on the pleasure which some take in the slips and falls
  of Priests: which is a great signe of Reprobation. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that of

  King <hi>Balacks</hi> Embassadours bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing money in their hands, shall buy
  their prophecies of them. Our Sauiour complained of them, That they deuoured
  widdowes houses. And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> alluding hereunto, saith, <hi>God is
  my witnesse, how I desire you all in the bowels of Christ.</hi> He saith not,
  In my bowells, but, In the bowells of Iesus Christ. <hi>Quis ibit nobis? Who
  shall goe for vs?</hi> It was Gods question, but he could find few that would
  fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him: but if to gainethe world, and to get wealth, hee shall but aske
  the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, <hi>Quis ibit?</hi> he shall haue infinite numbers to troupe
  after him. But asking, <hi>Quis ibit nobis? Who shall goe for vs?</hi> he shall
  scarce haue one to goe along with him. Euerie yeare a great number of Preachers
  offer themselues to this enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise, but they doe not vnderstand whither, or
  to what end they goe: As Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> signifieth vnto vs in his
  <hi>Confessions. Esay</hi> complained, That his lips were foule. He might
  better (to my seeming) haue complained of his eyes, than his lips, because he
  had seene God with them: For to murmure, eyes are more necessarie than lips;
  but to preach, lips are more necessarie than eyes. If he that studies would but
  consider with himselfe, why God hath giuen him wit, abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and learning; he
  would then peraduenture acknowledge, how vnworthie he is of so high a Calling,
  as to sit in <hi>Moses</hi> Chaire, or to goe vp into the Pulpit.
  <hi>Cicero</hi> saith, That the Orators motiue is, <hi>Amoris ardor, A desire
  to be beloued and esteemed.</hi> So it goes now, but not so well; for the loue
  which a Preacher is to pretend, and the credit which hee is to hunt after, is
  the loue of God, and the seeking after his glorie. <hi>Dicam semper
  magnificetur Dominus, I will alwayes say, The Lord be magnified</hi>; That

  their publike Ministers, not to be compassionate of the poore, nor to pitty
  their paines, thinking all too little they doe, pressing and oppressing them
  dayly more and more, with intollerable Taxes, and insupportable payments. The

  And if thou shalt aske me a thousand times ouer and ouer, Which is the way that
  leadeth to Blisse? my answer must bee, Humilitie. Heare what Pope <hi>Leo</hi>
  saith, <hi>Tota disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plina Christiana, &amp;c. The whole course of Christian

  the verie bowells of his mother, of all other ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues he made choice of

  warre, and temptation, in a word, where nothing is secure and certaine,
  Humilitie (amongst these so many perills and dangers, which are like so many

Where we are to consider, That hee, that goes to receiue Death, showes great
content, great courage, and great valour. But those, that go to receiue Life,
great cowardize, great sorrow, and great feare. Whence it came to passe, that

after.</p>

<hi>Epiphanius</hi> sayth, That this our Sauiours sorrow, grew from the desire
that he had to dye. For, if hee should alwayes haue exprest this his
willingnesse that he had to dye; the Deuil, fearefull of his owne hurt, would
haue sought to haue diuerted it. And as <hi>Pilats</hi> wife was drawne to
solicite his life, so would he likewise haue solicited all Hierusalem to saue
him, had hee so well knowne then as he did afterwards, that Christs death would
haue bin so ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantagious to mankind. He was willing likewise to prouoke
thereby, his and our aduersary, &amp; to put him more eagerly vpon the
businesse: persuading himselfe, that this his sorrow proceeded out of feare.
Most men (sayth <hi>Epiphanius</hi>) feare to dye; only our Sauiors feare was,
not to dye. Christ, by his feare of life, sought to secure his death. Howbeit,
we must withall acknowledge, that he did truely both greeue, and feare.</p>

nature should suffer cowardize and feare, seeing death neere at hand, as wee
haue seene the experiment of it in the greatest Saints that are in Heauen, as
in <hi>Elias, Iob,</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul</hi>; so not to feare death, is the
priuiledge and fauour of Grace. To feare it, is the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of nature, which
doth naturally desire the conseruation of it's beeing, and the preseruation of
it's life. Nor is it much, that Nature should discouer in man this weakenesse
and cowardize; when as being vnited to the God-head in our Sauiour Christ, he
did begge and intreat, <hi>according to this his inferiour part,</hi> to wit
his humanity, <hi>If it be possible let this cup passe from me.</hi> Whereupon

life and being. <hi>Nolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus spoliari, sed superuestiri, We would not be

of death read vnto them, yet could they not remooue the feare of death from
them. And if humane nature wrought vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Sauiour Christ, according to that

  that it may be of profit vnto vs, is not to be posted ouer in hast, nor to bee
  looked on all at once, but by peecemeale, and a leasurely gazing thereupon. For
  there is not a wheale nor a stripe in that diuine Body, but may very well take

  especially in such an age as this, wherein no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is blotted more out of our

  fall with it; And that there is no matter, no subiect, so soueraigne, nor so

  Lambe which God commanded to be eaten, in <hi>Exodus,</hi> which was a figure
  of that Lambe which was crucified on the Crosse, sayth, That albeit hee
  commanded, that they should eate it in hast, in regard of the hast which the
  Iewes and the Gentiles should make in his iudgement, and in his death; yet
  not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, he willed them to haue a care, that they should not breake so
  much as a bone of his bodie; And beeing it was to bee diuided amongst many,
  they must of force be driuen to cut it in peeces, and to eat it very leisurely,
  beholding and charily considering the ioynts and ligaments of the least bones.
  Wee must therefore leisurely and considerately meditate on that History, which
  beeing well and truely weighed, is the generall remedie to all our sores and
  diseases. It is that true Fishpoole which healeth all our infirmities: It
  maketh the Couetous man, liberall, in seeing the God of loue stript naked for
  our sakes, of all that hee hath. The Glutton, Christs gall and vinigar, makes
  temperate, and teaches him to fast. The Chollerick man, our Sauiours patience,

  <hi>Cantabiles mihi erant iustificationes tuae in loco peregrinationis

  those torments of our Sauiour Christ, and saith, That when <hi>Dauid</hi> was
  banished and persecuted, hee sung of them as hee went vp and downe in this his

  which serue as a sweet and fragrant Nosegay to refresh and comfort my heart.
  The Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Christ (as it is in the <hi>Apocalyps</hi>) is the booke of
  Life. All the bookes of all the Libraries in the world; all the Schooles and
  Vniuersities put together, neuer taught that which this booke teacheth. Saint
  <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, <hi>Lignum mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rientis, Cathedra fuit Magistri
  docentis.</hi> There was neuer any Schoole in the world like to that of the
  Crosse, nor any Master like vnto Christ, that hung thereupon. Saint
  <hi>Paul</hi> cries out, <hi>O foolish Galathians, who hath bewitched you, that
  yee should not obey the truth, to whom Iesus Christ before was described, in
  your sight,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Galat.</hi> 3.</note> 
                  <hi>and among you
  crucified?</hi> He had set before the Galathians Christ vpon the Crosse,
  presenting himselfe vnto them so naturally, and so to the life, as if they had
  seene the verie originall it selfe, as it stood all begoared with bloud in
  Mount Caluarie: And that vnlesse they were mad men, bewitched, or starke
  fooles, they could not but be taken and captiuated therewith, nor for their
  liues refuse to loue him and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in him. If Saint <hi>Paul</hi> made him
  so rich and so glorious by his eloquence, What a pretious peece must it needs
  be, when Christ himselfe, by suffering in those his delicate limbes, did limne
  it forth vnto vs at his death; his thornes, his nailes, his wan visage, his
  bored hands and feet, and his wounded side, vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring more Rhethoricke in that
  last Act and Scaene of his life, than all the elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of <hi>Paul,</hi> or
  the pennes of the whole World since, were euer able to expresse.</p>
               <p>The second, Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> saith, That our Sauiour
  sought to oblige them vnto him, by giuing them such a particular account, that
  he was to suffer and to die out of his especiall loue towards them, as also all
  Mankind; and that this therefore ought not to giue them occasion to withdraw
  their respect from him, or that he should thereby lose any one jot of his
  reputation among them. <hi>Mori, hominis est<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> sed velle mori, Dei,</hi> i.
  <hi>To die, is of man; but to be willing to die, of God:</hi> And because
  herein I pretend your good, I ought to lose nothing with you, by losing my
  life. One of the greatest indeerements of his loue was, That hee did esteem it
  as a reward of all his indured troubles and torments, that he should not lose
  his worth with vs. This made him to say, <hi>Happie is that man who shall not
  thinke lesse worthie of me than I deserue. Tertullian</hi> controlled an
  Hereticke that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the diuinitie of our Sauiour Christ; the cobwebs of the
  cratch, the pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of his life, and the accursednes of his death, being no
  way able to take hold vpon him. Those verie things (saith he) that blind thee,
  ought to conuince thee, and to affectionate thee vnto him; for none but God
  could doe thus much <pb n="222" facs="tcp:22083:121"/> for thee. And it is a lamentable
  case, that those good things that hee did for thee, that thou mightest beleeue
  in him and loue him, should be motiues vnto thee for to offend him. God hauing
  commanded that Ierusalem should bee re-edified after their first freedome from
  Babylon, there were some graue men grounded in Iudaisme, who misinterpreting
  (as Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> hath noted it) the prophecie of
  <hi>Ezechiel</hi>;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ezech.</hi> 11.3.</note> said,
  <hi>Haec est lebes, nos autem carnes, This Citie is the caldron, and we be the
  Flesh:</hi> For God to command vs to rebuild this Citie, is as if he should
  will vs to make a Caldron wherein to boyle our selues. Of his loue they made a
  loathing, and interpreted his fauour to be an iniurie. God took this their
  vnthankefulnesse so ill, that he quitted them the second time both of their
  coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie and their libertie. It is you that haue made Ierusalem a Caldron of
  the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; I will bring you out of the middest thereof, and deliuer you
  into the hands of strangers, yee shall fall by the sword; and this Citie (as
  yee falsly sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose) shall not be your Caldron, neither shall yee be the flesh
  in the midst there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. The same reason is repeated by the Prophet <hi>Ose, I
  gaue yee wine, wheat, oyle, gold, and siluer; but yee spent it in the seruice
  of the Idoll Baal, therefore will I take from yee my wine, my wheat,

               <p>The death of our Sauiour Christ may be considered two manner of

               <p>

 his enemies with astonishment; neuer any man saw him laugh; weepe, they haue;

 hath he done to many<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he healed by hundreds such as had been sicke of
 incurable diseases; he did cast out Deuills; he raised the Dead; and his
 miracles beeing numberlesse, they were done all for others good; he did not
 worke any miracle wherein was to be seene the least vanitie or boasting in the
 world. The Iewes out of enuie layd hold on him, and with a kind of hypocrisie
 and outward humilitie, rather see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, than being Saints, trampled him vnder
 foot, and marred his cause. I whipt him for to appease their furie, and the
 people being about to mutine, I condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him to the death of the Crosse. A
 little before he breathed his last, hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired of God, that he would forgiue
 those his enemies which had nailed him to the Crosse. At his death there were
 many prodigious signes both in heauen and earth; the Sunne was darkened, and

               <p>As it is Gospel, you shall see in this his death innumerabie
  truths: First of all, let not the asperousnesse and hardnesse to the way of

  Christ, it shall (though <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

  <hi>Iacob</hi> saw God holding the Ladder which reached to Heauen, whereunto
  hee set his helping hand, the better to secure it, to the end that euerie man
  (as <hi>Philon</hi> hath noted it) might without feare climbe vp to the top of
  it. S. <hi>Hierome</hi> goes a little further, and says, That hee did not
  thereby onely promise safetie, but helpe; for God did stretch out his hand from
  aboue, and did reach it forth vnto those that were willing to get vp: According
  to that of <hi>Dauid, Emitte manum tuam de alto,</hi> (i.) <hi>Send out thy

                  <hi>Lysias</hi> when he had gathered about fourescore thousand Foot, with all
  the Horsemen he had, he came against the Iewes, thinking to make Ierusalem an
  habitation of the Gentiles: and because of his great number of Footmen, his
  thousands of Horsemen, and his fourescore Elephants, the Captains and Souldiers
  of Gods people were quite out of heart, making prayers with weeping and teares
  before the Lord, That hee would send a good Angell to deliuer Israell. And as
  they were besides Ierusalem, there appeared before them vpon horsebacke, a man
  in white cloathing, shaking his harnesse of gold. Then they praised the
  mercifull God all together, and tooke heart, insomuch that they were readie not
  onely to fight with men, but with the most cruell beasts, and to breake downe
  walls of yron. Marching then forward in battell array, hauing an helper from
  heauen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> running vpon their enemies like Lyons, they slew eleuen thousand
  footmen, and sixteene hundred Horsemen, and put all the other to flight.
  Another Horseman was he that Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> saw vpon a white Horse,
  bearing this for his Motto, <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens vt vinceret.</hi> Which takes from vs

               <p>Secondly, it assureth vs, That he that offereth vs so much, can
  denie vs no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; he could not well giue vs more, nor would hee giue vs lesse
  than that which he hath alreadie so liberally bestowed vpon vs. Yet this gift
  may receiue increase (as Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> hath noted it) according to the
  manner of it. For in all things whatsoeuer, are to be considered, the thing
  What, and the thing How, or Why; the Accident, and the Substance; and sometimes
  Gods Attributes doe shine more in the Accident, than in the Substance. Whence I
  inferre, That he that gaue so much with so much loue, and sees that it is all
  cast away, and that his loue is so ill requited, it is not much if he be much
  offended with vs. <hi>Ergo in vacuum laborani, &amp;c. In vaine then haue I

  Christ, who it is that suffereth these things? hee will answer, That it is the

  of God. And peraduenture this is the mysterie of it, That albeit our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
  Christ is the party that suffered (as the Prophets prophecie of him;) yet he
  suffered as a <hi>Fiador,</hi> or Surety. But so great was the loue which hee
  bare to Man, who was the Debtor, that putting these torments, which wee were
  lyable vnto, to his owne account, yet the discharge of this debt goes in the
  name of the Debtor. And as the treasure of his merits, is for the good of Man;
  so his tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and his sufferings, are to bee attributed wholly to Man, who
  was the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, that by the ordinary course of Law did owe this debt, and was

  <hi>Tradetur.</hi> Peraduenture, because it was one of his greatest griefes,
  that his friend should betray him; <hi>The man of Peace in whome I hoped,</hi>
  sayth <hi>Dauid. Thomas</hi> sayth, That it is one of the noblest actions in
  the world for a man to loue his friend; because to abhorre him, is one of the

                  <hi>He
  gloried in his supplanting me.</hi> What greater griefe can befall a friend,
  than to bee supplanted by a friend? The metaphor is taken from those that run,
  when as the one trips vp the others heeles. Saint <hi>Ierome</hi> reads it,
  <hi>Leuauit contra me caltaneum, Hee lifted vp the heele against me.</hi> Our
  Sauiour Christ flying to death with the wings of Loue, <hi>Iudas</hi> setting
  his legge of Treason before him to throw him downe, his Loue found it selfe
  thereby offended, and beeing thus wronged by a friend, his Loue had no need of
  such spurres to driue him on to his death. But say it should, it was not fit
  for a friend to put them on. He of all other, should not haue led him along
  therunto, falsifying his loue by a feigned kisse, &amp; kindly saluting him,
  with an <hi>Aue Rabbi, Haile Master.</hi> To whom our Sauiour milde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againe
  replyd, <hi>Amice, ad quid venisti? Friend, wherefore camest thou?</hi> What
  needst thou to haue taken so much paines, thou mightest haue saued thy selfe
  this labour, being it was myne own desire to make my selfe a prisoner? yet it
  doth much trouble me, that my friend should deale so vnkindly with me.</p>

  them, exceeding much: Being like vnto that sicke man, who not thinking of the

  he was mindfull of <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi>; but <hi>Iames</hi> and
  <hi>Iohn</hi> did not once thinke vpon <hi>Peter.</hi> The reason whereof is,
  for that the glorie of heauen is easily parted and diuided with others: And
  because God will that all should bee saued, man is likewise willing to yeeld
  thereunto. But for the glorie of the earth, there is scarce that man that will
  admit a copart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. And if Christ our Sauiour had granted them their request,
  they would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently haue contested, which should haue sate on his right hand.
  For in these worldly aduancements and honours, brother will be against brother,
  and seeke to cut each others throat. <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Esau</hi> stroue
  who should be borne first, &amp; get away the blessing from the other.</p>

  (sayth <hi>Aristotle</hi>) to doe what hee will; to Man, to doe what he can:
  But now the World is turned topsituruie; God does what hee can; and Man, what
  he will. Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> in an Epist. of his, complaineth of the
  Ecclesiasticall prouisions which were made in his time; They leapt (satih hee)
  from the Ferula to the Crosyers staffe; being gladder to see themselues freed
  from the Rod, than of the Honours that were throwne vpon them. <hi>Seneca</hi>
  called that, The golden Age, wherein Dignities were conferred on those that
  deserued them; condemning the Age wherein hee liued, to bee the Yron Age. But I
  say, That this present Age which we now inioy, is the happiest that euer our
  Church had: For, in those former times, those that were the learnedest and the
  holiest men, fled into the Desarts, and hid themselues in Caues, that they
  might not bee persecuted with Honours: For they had no sooner notice of a holy
  man; (albeit he liued coopt vp in a corner) but that they forced him thence,
  clapping a Miter on his head, and other dignities: And there are verie strange
  Histories of this truth. But to all those that liue now in these times, I can
  giue them these glad tydings, That they may inioy their quiet, and sit
  peaceably at home in their priuat lodgings, resting safe and secure, that this
  trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble shall not come to their doores; for now a dayes, onely fauour, or
  other by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respects of the flesh, haue prouided a remedie for this euill.</p>

                  <hi>It lies not in me to giue you.</hi> Christ would rather
  seeme to lessen somewhat of his power, than to lessen any thing of his loue.
  And therefore he doth not say, I will not doe it; for that would haue beene too
  foule and churlish a word in the mouth of so mild a Prince<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and he should
  thereby haue done wrong to his own will, who desires that all might haue such
  seats as they did sue to sit in. Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> vnfoldeth our Sauiours
  meaning, <hi>Bonus Dominus maluit dissimulare de jure, quam de charitate
  deponere, He had rather they should question his right, than his loue.</hi> The
  selfe same Doctor saith, That he made choice rather of <hi>Iudas</hi> than any
  other, though to man it might seeme, that hee therein wronged his wisedome; for
  the World might from thence take occasion to say, That he did not know how to
  distinguish of men, being that he had made choyce of such an Apostle. But this
  was done out of his especiall prouidence, (saith Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi>) in
  fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of his loue: For he being in our opinion, to runne the hazard of his
  wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome or his loue, he had rather of the two suffer in his wisedome; for no
  man could otherwise presume of him, but that he loued <hi>Iudas.</hi> The
  History of <hi>Ionas</hi> proues this point, who refused to go to Niniuie; it
  seeming vnto him, that both God and himselfe should (as <hi>Nazianzen</hi>
  saith) be discredited in the world. But he willed him the second time, That he
  should go to Niniuie, and that he should preach vnto them, <hi>Yet fortie
  dayes, and Niniuie shall be ouerthrowne.</hi>

 3.4.</note> At last hee was carried thither perforce, whither hee would or no:
  And the reason why God carried this businesse thus, was, That if afterwards hee
  should not destroy this Citie, he might happely hazard the opinion of his
  power, but not of his loue. The like is repeated by Saint
  <hi>Chrysostome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ionas</hi> did likewise refuse to goe to Niniuie, that he
  might not at last be found a Lyer; esteeming more the opinion of his truth,
  than of his loue. Hence ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth in the Prelats and the Princes, this word
  <hi>Nolumus, Wee will not haue it so</hi>; which sauours of too much harshnesse
  and tyrannie. <hi>Sic volo, sic jubeo, sit pro ratione voluntas, Their will is
  a Law vnto them.</hi> But he that shall make more rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning of the opinion of
  his willingnesse, and of his loue, than of his power, <pb n="232" facs="tcp:22083:126"/>
  and his wisedome, will say, <hi>Non possum, I cannot,</hi> it is not in my
  power to doe it: It grieues mee to the verie heart, and I blush for shame, that
  I am not able to performe your desire. Which is a great comfort for him that is
  a suitor, when hee shall vnderstand, that his Petition is not denied out of
  disaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, but disabilitie. When <hi>Naboth</hi> was to bee sentenced to
  death, the Iudges did proclaime a Fast: And <hi>Abulensis</hi> saith, That it
  was a common custome amongst the Iudges in those dayes, whensoeuer they did
  pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the sentence of death against an Offendor; to the end, to giue the
  World to vnderstand, That that mans death did torment and grieue their Soule.
  For, to condemne a man to death with a merrie and cheerefull coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, is
  more befitting Beasts, than Men. When our Sauiour Christ en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred Hierusalem in
  Triumph, the ruine of that famous Citie representing it selfe vnto him, hee
  shed teares of sorrow. Doth it grieue thee, ô Lord, that it must be
  destroyed? Destroy it not then. I cannot doe so; for that will not stand with
  my Iustice. O Lord, doe not weepe then. I cannot choose. And why, good Lord?
  Because it will not stand with my Mercie. And that Iudge, who euer hee be, if
  hee haue any pittie in the world in him, cannot for his heart bloud, when hee
  sentenceth a Malefactor to some grieuous punishment, or terrible torment, but
  haue some melting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in his eyes, and some sorrow in his heart. God so
  pierce our hearts with pittie and compassion towards our poore afflicted
  brethren, that hauing a fellow-feeling of their miseries, wee may finde fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
  at his hands, who is the Father of Pittie, and onely Fountaine of all
  Mercie.</p>

that he was charged withall,<note place="margin">Riches may be possessed, but not

therefore <hi>Dauid</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiseth vs not to set our hearts vpon them. Hee that
longeth and desireth to bee rich, euen to imaginarie riches, resigneth vp his
heart. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne rich men, but those that did
desire to bee rich. The Deuill sets a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand ginnes and snares about those
that haue set their desires vpon riches. What greater snare than that pit-fall
which was prepared as a punishment for <hi>Tantalus,</hi> who standing vp to

the Rich is still emptie, and can neuer be filled. What greater snare, than to
denie a morcell of bread to the hungrie, pitty being so proper and naturall to
the brest and bowells of man? But this he too vsually doth, that desires to be
rich; for he that goes alwayes in chase, <hi>in propriam satie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem, to glut

                  <hi>Esay.</hi> 30.6.</note> vnlesse it be to bring him
the sooner to his graue. <hi>Esay</hi> saith, That hee saw a Lyon, a Lyonesse,
a Viper, and a firie flying Serpent comming against those that shall beare
their riches vpon the shoulders of the Colts, and their treasures vpon the
bunches of the Cammells, to a strange Countrie, where it shal do them no good.
By the Lyon and Lyonesse, the Viper, and the firie flying Serpent, the Prophet
vnderstandeth those Deuills whom <hi>Dauid</hi> stiles Aspes and Basi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liskes,
Lyons, and Dragons, and by those Colts and Cammells, rich men laden with
treasures, whose Carriers are the Deuills, who driue them along till they bring
them to Hell, with their backes galled, and their bodies bruised, bearing this
Motto in their forehead, <hi>Lassati sumus via iniquitatis, Wee are wearied in
the way of Iniquitie. Origen</hi> hath obserued, That those rich men whom God
wished well to in the Old Testament, he bestowed liuing riches vpon them, as
flocks of Sheepe, heards of Cattell, Bread, Wine, and Oyle, which are the
principall floures and best fruits of the earth. And the Patriarkes did desire

               <p>Three principles do condemne the excesse of apparell.</p>
               <p>The one, For a man to place too much pleasure and happinesse
  therein; as if he had been borne for no other end, but to weare rich and gay
  cloathes.</p>
               <p>The other, To ordaine them to a bad end. Saint
  <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, That wee should not so much intend the vse of pompous
  and glorious apparell, as the end for which wee vse them, <hi>Non vsus, sed
  libido in culpa est.</hi> The loose Wanton adornes himselfe with Silkes, with
  Diamonds, and brooches of gold; the Priest he adornes himselfe with a rich
  Stole, with a Cope curiously embroydred; the one, to enamour poore sillie
  Soules; the other, to offer Sacrifice decently before his God: The one
  offendeth; the other pleaseth; because, <hi>Non vsus, sed libido in culpa
  est.</hi> He that hath trauelled abroad, and beene long from home in forrain
  Countries, claps good cloathes on his backe, thinking that those will adde more
  credit to his person, than is answerable to his fortunes; <hi>Non vsus, sed

                     </gap> culpa est, It is not our
  lacke, but our lust which must be blamed.</hi> A married wife trickes vp
  herselfe, and dresses her selfe neat, the better to please her husband and her
  familie; for a wife is the beautie, the joy, and life of a house. The Whore
  shee pranks vp her selfe too, but onely to allure loose beholders.
  <hi>Salomon</hi> commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a manly mettled woman, sayes, That she cloathed
  her selfe with Purple and <pb n="235" facs="tcp:22083:127"/> with Silke. The
  <hi>Apocalyps</hi> condemning that Whore of Babylon who held a cup of poyson in
  her hand, saith, That it was couered with gold: In the one was Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; in the
  other, Vice; and therefore not our need, but our nicenesse is in fault. Many
  for to complie with the authoritie of their dignities and places of honour,
  haue outwardly worne rich and costly cloaths, but inward next to their skinnes,
  shirts of haire; as <hi>Theodosius, Nepotianus,</hi> and others. For, as that
  which enters in at the mouth doth not defile the soule; so, outward cloathes do
  not hurt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man; <hi>Sed libido in causa est.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third Principle is out of Saint <hi>Augustine, Homo
  circumferens mortalitatem, circumfert testimonium peccati sui, Man, that beares
  mortalitie about him, doth like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise beare about him a testimonie of his
  sinne.</hi> God cloathing man with the skinnes of dead beasts, gaue vs thereby
  to vnderstand, That these our cloathes serue as so many witnesses of mans sin
  and mortalitie; as the casting of the blacke cloake vpon the shoulders of some
  great Bashaw, shewes, that hee hath offended the grand Seigniour, and that his
  death is at hand. The Spanish Nation heares ill abroad, for the often change of
  fashions in their cloathes, running dayly out of one into another; it is a vice
  that they are much taxed for. And therefore,<note place="margin">If the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish,
 God helpe the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish.</note> one painting forth the particular fashions of
  apparell belonging to all Nations what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer, when he commeth to portray forth
  a Spaniard, he sets him vpon a shop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boord, with a peece of stuffe before him,
  and a paire of sheeres in his hand, to the end that hee might cut out his
  cloathes into what kind of fashion his fancie should best affect: Expressing
  therein, that he was so fantasticall, so various, and so mutable, that euerie
  day he would haue a new inuention. And to this purpose sutes that
  Hierogliphycke of <hi>Augustinus Celius</hi>; It beeing brought to the gods
  knowledge, That the Moone wandered vp and downe naked ouer hills &amp; dales;
  they sent <hi>Mercurie</hi> vnto her, to cut her out a garment, and to make it
  vp for her: But he could neuer come to take any true measure of her, by reason
  of her ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie creasings and wanings, not knowing what course in the world
  to take, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse he should euerie day make her a new gowne. In a word, this
  rich mans robe was Prides ensigne, Luxuries nest, and Deaths Mantle.</p>
               <p>Heretofore, Purple and fine Linnen, Silkes, and Veluets, were
  onely cloathing for Kings, and such as were eminent persons in Court, and were
  dayly in his Maiesties eye, waiting and attending his person. But now, euerie
  one will in his weare and fashion, seeme to be that which he is not: The Clerke
  will goe as the Squire; the Squire as the Knight; the Knight as the Lord; the
  Lord as a Grande; a Grande as a King; and a King as God. The Prouerb, <hi>That
  it is not the Cowle that makes the Monke,</hi> is verified of all Estates: But
  as the richnesse of the garnishing addes not any finenesse to the Sword; (the
  comparison is <hi>Seneca's</hi>) so, a mans cloathes doe not better his being,
  nor adde any worth to him that weares them; but though he be not bettered in
  his being, yet hee is so much bettered in his seeming, that a man had need of
  some particular reuelation, to know which is which, and to whom we owe a
  respect and reuerence. To a Coward (who like <hi>Hercules,</hi> had lapt

  what Nature will bee well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented withall, thou shalt be rich; but if what
  Vanitie will egge thee vnto, thou shalt be poore. <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi>
  hath a particular Discourse vpon this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, and that so large and so full,
  that it seemeth he had beene in all the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of the Citie where he dwelt,
  and had diligently obserued what had past in euerie one of them. To what end
  (saith he) serueth a Bed with pillars of siluer, and pommels of gold, if thou
  sleepest as well (if not better) in one of Wood? To what end serue Curtaines of
  silke interwouen with gold, and Quilts curiou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sly embroydered, if those of
  woollen keepe thee warmer? To what end a Cup of Crystall, if one of Glasse will
  as well serue the turne? For to dig into the earth, thou wilt not make thee a
  Spade or Mattocke of siluer, because that were a superfluous and needlesse
  thing: As needlesse and superfluous a thing is it, to haue a Bed of Yuorie,
  Ebonie, &amp;c. But, which is worse than all the rest, Saint
  <hi>Chrysostome</hi> saith, That for to feed our vanities, wee neuer want
  meanes nor mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys; but to pay our debts, or to bestow an Almes, or to relieue
  a friend in ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie, there is no money to be found. One of the greatest
  charges, and most without excuse, which God will charge your rich and powerfull
  men withall, is, God hath giuen thee all this thy present prosperitie which
  thou enioyest, thy Lands, thy Rents, thy Lordships, thy Tenants, thy Gold, thy
  Siluer, &amp;c. And that God (who hath thus blest and prospered thee in the
  World) standing poore, naked, and hunger-starued at thy doore, thou hast faire
  Liueries for seruants, rich furniture for thy horses, siluer Garrotes or Wrests
  to packe vp and fasten thy Sumpter vpon thy strong backed Mules, costly
  Banquets for thy friends; but not so much as a rag or a crum to bestow vpon him
  who hath thus inriched thee with all these: <hi>Inexcusabilis es, ô
  Homo,</hi> Neither thou nor all the World knowes how to make answer to this
  obiection. Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> makes the like complaint, discoursing of
  those Ladies whose Coaches may rather be said to be of gold, than guilded;
  whose necks are laden with chains of Pearle, &amp; their fingers with Diamonds;
  and that they should liue thus in their jollitie &amp; plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and Christ die
  at their doores for hunger, it is such a charge, that when it comes to be laid
  home vnto them, it will admit no excuse.</p>

                  <hi>He fared diliciously euerie day.</hi> Many of Gods Saints

  Tobie, Iob,</hi> and others; <pb n="237" facs="tcp:22083:128"/> but these their Feasts were
  modest and moderate, they were great, but not often. And neither can or will
  any man make dayly Feasts, vnlesse it bee such a one as makes his bellie his
  God, and thinkes that he was borne for no other end, but to pamper vp the
  flesh, and to make much of himselfe. Euerie vice whatsoeuer, is as a linke to a
  chaine, which drawes many other after it: but that of Gluttony, of all other is
  the most tyrannous and the most violent.</p>
               <p>First of all, It drawes dishonestie after it, as heretofore hath
  beene prooued. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> doth so wedge and glew these two vices

  And in another place he saith, That eating prouoketh the bodie, and that the
  bodie desireth and lusteth after eating.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It spoyles and marres the tongue, as Saint
  <hi>Gregorie</hi> prooueth it. There are two things (saith <hi>Salomon</hi>)
  that are able to, nay, doe ouerthrow the World; a Slaue sitting in the Kings
  Throne, that is one of them; the other, a Foole, whose bellie is glutted with
  meat, and whose head is full of wine. And if too much eating and drinking make
  the most discreet and best aduised man to lose the reyns of reason; what will
  it worke vpon a foole?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It doth darken the Vnderstanding, as Saint
  <hi>Chrysostome</hi> hath noted it, alledging the example of <hi>Esau,</hi> who
  after he had eaten and drunken his fil, made light reckoning of the selling of
  his birthrigh. The fogges and vapours of the earth, cloud Heauen; those of the

  well, is more desperate, than that of liuing ill. Many loose Wantons come to be

  rich man, Saint <hi>Luke</hi> sayth, That hee dyed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midst his continuall

               <p>Saint <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> layes this to this rich mans charge,
  That he did not beleeue the immortalitie of the Soule; nor the eternall
  happinesses, and miseries of that other life. And a great argument for the
  proofe thereof, is, That hee was so ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie with <hi>Abraham,</hi> That he
  would send one from the dead, to preach this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine to his Kinsfolke, and

  commonly the most wealthie. But the trueth of it is, That this is a mysterie of
  Gods prouidence, though secret, and hid. Hee made the rich men his sonnes and

  their secure sustenance: And hee made the poore, heires of Heauen, that the

  <hi>Ecclesiasticus</hi> saith, That a poore man that is sound and lustie, is
  better than a rich man that is sicke and feeble. Health is of a greater price
  than either gold or siluer, and there is no treasure to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a bodie
  that is strong and healthie. And indeering this truth, hee saith, That death is
  a lesse euill than a bitter life; and the graue, than a long and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous
  sickenesse. So that in conclusion, he preferreth health before life. But if to
  these sores of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> we shall adde hunger, nakednesse, and

  these two interpretations you may take which you please; but I am sure, neither
  of both but is a sinne, and that a great one too. In which sinne of this
  vncharitable Chuffe, wee are to consider three verie wofull circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances.</p>
               <p>The first, That it is a sinne that is generally hated and
  abhorr'd. For all other sinnes haue some Patrons to protect them, some abettors
  to defend them, or some fauourers to excuse them, if not in heauen, yet at
  least here on earth; but against this vnmercifull and hard hearted sinne, God,
  Heauen, Earth, Angells, and Men, haue so open and wide an eare, and conceiue so
  ill of it, that they thinke none deserues Hell better. And therefore it is
  said, <hi>Iudicium sine misericordia, his qui non faciunt misericordiam,
  Iudgement without mercie, to those that shew no mercie.</hi> When he
  falls,<note place="margin">

  him: <hi>Reuelabunt Coeli iniquitatem ei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

  wickednesse, and the Earth shall rise vp against him.</hi> All the World will
  crie out against an vnmercifull min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded man; as on the contrarie, they will
  praise and applaud him that is of a pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and tender disposition:
  <hi>Enarrabit Eleemosynas suas omnis Ecclesia Sanctorum, The whole Congregation
  shall talke of his praise,</hi> and the Generations that are to come shall
  speake good things of him. Whereas the other, his name shall perish from off
  the earth, but his torments in hell shall endure for euer. Saint
  <hi>Austen</hi> is of opinion, That there is not any sinne more iniurious to
  Nature, than this. You shall haue a rich man keepe in his house a Lyon, a
  Beare, fiue or sixe cast of Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, to all which, he alots dayly a liberal
  allowance: the poore man comes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, makes his moane, and in a pittifull
  and humble fashion sayes vnto him, Sir, I beseech you (for Gods sake) bestow
  one single pennie, or a piece of bread on a poore weake creature, that is not
  able to worke for his liuing: Yet wil not the rich man giue him that which he
  giues vnto his Beasts; ô, what an inhumane thing is this, and how harsh
  to euery good mans nature.</p>
               <p>The second circumstance is this, That God doth with such
  difficultie remit this sinne, that if any be irremissable, it is this: not only
  for it's crueltie, so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to the bowells of Gods compassion; but also,
  for that taxing his proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, he makes such light reckoning of the miseries
  of the Poore, that hee weighes them by ounces, and measures them out by ynches:
  nay, hee proceeds further, by adding griefe vnto griefe, and affliction to
  affliction; and iudging those jerks of Gods diuine Iustice to be too gentle, he
  lays a heauier hand &amp; grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter load vpon him.<note place="margin">

  happinesse; so Hell, is a misery that includeth all miseries. There was neuer
  yet any tyrant in the world, in whose prisons and dungeons all torments were
  inflicted at once. But in that of Hell, there is not any torment, which is not
  felt at one and the same instant. The body, that shall generally suffer: And
  for this, fire, and cold, will suffice; which are generall torments. The soule
  shall likewise generally suffer sorrow and paine, not only because the fire
  shall burne it, which though corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, yet shall it's flames haue an

  Deuills, roaring and yellowing like so many mad Bulls, that with the dinne and
  hideousnesse of the noyse, Heauen and Earth might haue seemed to come together,
  and the whole frame and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine of the Orbes to haue crackt and fallen in

  thing (as Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> hath noted it) from whence they shall not
  receiue most grieuous paine and torment. But of all other torments, that of
  their desperation will be the greatest, because there will be no wading through
  this Lake that burnes with fire and brimstone, nor no end at all to these their
  endlesse miseries. That ten thousand, nay, a hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand yeares
  continuance in hell shall not suffice to satisfie for their sinnes, that the
  fountaine of mercie should be shut vp for euer, not affoording them so much as

                  <note place="margin">Why the rich mans petition was

                  <hi>Origen</hi> saith, That this rich man did desire, That
  either <hi>Lazarus,</hi> or some one from the Dead, might bee sent to preach
  this point: thinking with himselfe, That <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> might happely send
  him vnto himselfe, as to one that by this time verie wel knew his owne errour;
  and that so by this meanes he might haue some pause or breathing time from
  these his torments. Whither this was so, or no, it may by some be doubted; but
  this is a cleere case, That the maine motiue that mooued him thereunto, was,
  the desire that he had that his brethren and kinsfolke might be drawne vnto
  repentance, and thereby come to be saued, and escape those in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable
  torments which he indured. Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> saith, That
  <hi>Abraham</hi> did not yeeld to the rich mans petition, because hee was not
  absolute Lord of that place: But that our Sauiour Christ supplied that defect,
  and carried him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe <pb n="246" facs="tcp:22083:134"/> like a most mercifull and kind
  louing Lord, to the end that that stiffe necked Nation might not alledge in
  their excuse, That hee had not sent them a Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher from that other life, to
  aduise them what passed there. But our Sauiour (for whom this businesse was
  reserued) did not raise vp <hi>Lazarus</hi> the Poore, but <hi>Lazarus</hi> the
  Rich, who vpon occasion preacht great &amp; notable things vnto them,
  concerning the life to come. And he likewise raised vp the sonne of the widow
  of Naim, that hee might also doe the like. But those that will not beleeue the
  Prophets (it is our Sauiours owne saying) will lesse beleeue the Dead.</p>

               <p>Gods chastisements are like Lightning, which kill one, but

  <hi>Aulus Gellius</hi> in his <hi>Noctibus Atticis,</hi> saith, That Princes

               </p>
               <p>The other, The authoritie of the offended; for if disrespect

               <p>The third, For the terror and example of others; for,
  <hi>Iusticia aliena est discipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na propria, Other mens punishment is our

  to beware. When the Lyon was sicke, all the beasts of the field went to visit
  him, onely the Foxe stayed behind, and would not goe vnto him: and being askt
  the reason, he answered, I find the tracke of many going in, but of none
  comming out; and I am not so desperate as to cast my selfe wilfully away, when

  of Christ: Saint <hi>Gregorie,</hi> The chastisement of Hierusalem. The Owner
  of this Vineyard had made it so perfect and so absolute, that the Renters
  thereof liued in a manner idle, and had little or nothing more to do, than to
  keepe it cleane from Thornes, and to gather and enioy the Fruits thereof:
  wherin this Master of a family shewed the great care he had of his house,
  treating therein touching mans good, &amp; the slight account that man made of
  this his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse and felicitie.<note place="margin">The cost which Christ was
 at with his Vineyard.</note> When God created the World, he tooke not vpon him
  the name of an Husbandman; nor did he take any paines in the creating of it,
  for he but sayd the word, and it was done, <hi>Ipse dixit, &amp; facta
  sunt.</hi> But this Vineyard of the Church, it cost him the paines of planting
  it, of compassing it in with a hedge, of digging a pit for the Winepresse, of
  building a Tower in it, besides the life of many of his seruants, as also of
  him, <hi>Quem acquisiuit sanguine suo.</hi> This was a new <hi>Noah,</hi> with
  whom that former old <hi>Noah</hi> was not to bee compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: For that, giuing
  an end to a yong world, though grown old in sin, destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the people, but not

               <p>— <hi>Vrbem signauit aratro:</hi> — So sayes the
  Poet. Whom Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> also citeth. But this Citie, which hath on
  the one side Heauen for it's prop, and on the other, the shoulders of our
  Sauiour Christ; What firmenesse and prosperitie must it enioy? And onely
  because Christ doth cherish &amp; water it, not only with his own most pretious
  bloud, but with that of so many Martyrs. <hi>Plutarch</hi> reporteth, That
  those of Eliopolis dranke no wine, beeing persuaded, that wine was the bloud of
  those Gyants which made warre against Heauen, of whose bodies beeing buried in
  the earth, sprang your Vines. And therefore when <hi>Alexander</hi> dranke much
  wine, <hi>Antocides</hi> would say vnto him, I pray Sir consider that yee
  drinke the bloud of the earth. These are all lies, yet may very well suit with
  this our truth; for wee are to vnderstand, That the Vines of the Faithfull
  sprang and grew vp from the bloud of that Gyant, of whom <hi>Dauid</hi> said,
  <hi>Exultauit vt Gygas adcurrendam viam.</hi> For that Morall, That the
  sprinkling of the bloud of those two Louers should giue colour &amp; ripenes to
  the Fruit, is a meere fable; but that the bloud of our Sauiour Christ should so
  season these wild Vines, as to make them to bring forth aboundance of fruit, is
  a knowne truth. Whence it is to be noted, that whither it be that these Vines
  do represent the faithful; or whither or no, because the wine thereof is turned
  into the bloud of our Sauiour Christ, the Deuill beares so great a hatred to
  the sprigs and bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the Vine, that there is not any thing that your
  Witches abhorre &amp; stand more in feare of. As you may read in <hi>Petrus
  Gregorius,</hi> in his Bookes <hi>De Republi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca. Plutarch</hi> saith, That your
  Vinestockes being watred with wine, drie and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther away: But the Vines of the
  Faithfull being besprinkled with the wine of the bloud of Christ, grow vp and
  fructifie the better. <hi>Vinum germinans Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi>; it ingendreth noble
  thoughts. The Poet inuites <hi>Aeneas,</hi> and calls vnto him in this sweet
  kind of language, <hi>Sate sanguine Diuum:</hi> But more noblenesse doth a
  Christian enioy in that <hi>Sate sanguine Christi. Seneca</hi> saith, That the
  noblenesse of bloud eleuateth our thoughts. And God saith by the mouth of
  <hi>Hose,</hi> That if the Israelites shall returne vnto him, that they shall

  If yee were vnfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in that wealth, honour, health, and beautie, which are

  <hi>Philon</hi> saith, That the goods of this life are anothers, not ours, and
  that wee doe but onely rent them <hi>ad voluntatem Domini, At the will and

  <hi>Epictetus</hi> saith, Doe not say, I haue lost such a thing; for it is an

  and from this ignorance growes our melanchollie. <hi>Seneca</hi> tells vs, That
  he that will not be content that God should be sole Lord of all, is vniust. He
  that thinkes himselfe wronged, when a man askes him that which he hath lent
  him, is a couetous wretch. He that esteeming a present good, is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getful of a

  those goods into his masters hands, which he had committed to his keeping, shal
  not think himself rid of a great care, &amp; more secure than before, is a
  foolish wretch. In the creation of all the rest of the things, <hi>Genesis</hi>
  vseth the name of God alone by it selfe; but when man comes to be made, it puts
  this adiunct of <hi>Dominus Deus, the Lord God</hi>; because man should not
  imagine that there was any other Lord that should be able to bring them into
  the Land of Promise, saue the Lord God. And therefore God saith, I will goe

                  <hi>Locauit Agricolis.</hi> God rented out this his Vineyard,

  should shut him out of his owne In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, keepe possession against him, and
  take his life from him?</p>
               <p>First of all, Because <hi>Seneca</hi> saith, That for a Prince
  to conferre a fauour, which to his seeming is well bestowed, and to lose it
  afterwards through the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude of the receiuer, is a token of a generous
  mind: For to this perill are they put, and all whosoeuer runne this hazard, who
  doe any courtesies in this life. For a forgetfull and vnthankfull man doth
  commonly shew himselfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindfull of the good which he receiueth: But for a
  Prince to doe a fauor where he knowes it shall be lost, and that his kindnesse
  is but cast away, this is Kingly magnificence, and a generous kind of
  noblenesse. And of this kind are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Gods fauours, who although we shew
  our selues vnthankefull, and do not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge these his fauours, yet he
  dayly throwes them vpon vs, that hee may thereby manifest both his greatnesse
  and his goodnesse.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Phylon</hi> saith, That he doth prosper the
  Vnthankefull, to draw them thereby to his seruice.</p>
               <p>First, Because there are no gyues nor fetters that tye a man so
  fast, as benefits, or make him more a prisoner; <hi>Qui beneficia inuenit,
  compedes inuenit.</hi> This is that which <hi>Ose</hi> saith, <hi>In funiculis

                     <hi>Ose.</hi>
 11.4.</note> 
                  <hi>In funiculis hominum,</hi> I led them with cords of a man,
  euen with bonds of loue. Bulls are made tame, and yeeld themselues to a fiue
  twisted cord; Horses are made gentle with bridles and with chaines; and mens
  hearts are woon with benefits; <hi>Qui co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronat te in misericordia, &amp; in
  miserationibus.</hi> God hath compassed thee in with so many mercies, and hath
  bound thee so fast vnto him, in the bonds of his louing kindnesse, that thou
  knowest not which way to get from him. <hi>Ioseph</hi> beeing ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to his
  master by the many fauors that he had receiued from him, said,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 39.9.</note> 
                  <hi>Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modo possum? How can I then doe
  this great wickednesse?</hi> How is it possible that I should shew my selfe
  such a Villaine to him, who knoweth not what hee hath in the house with me, but
  hath committed all that he hath to me; neither hath hee kept any thing from me
  but onely thee, because thou art his wife.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Because there is no other meanes comparable vnto this,
  That a Prince should deliuer vp all the world to such a mans seruice, and that
  he should extend his liberalitie to an vnknowne and vnthankefull people: And to
  this end he affoords his enemies water, and the fruits of the earth, and other
  temporall blessings, that therby they might take occasion to serue him. And if
  he bestow so many fauours vpon an vngratefull people, and if he haue care of
  the beasts of the forrest, what kindnesses will he shew vnto them that shall
  truly serue him.</p>

  into a greene Court: especially, hauing layd such a greeuous curse on those

               <p>
                  <hi>Hee let it out to Husbandmen. Locare,</hi> is a word of
  Espousall, or Marriage; and it sutes well with that Loue and Zeale, which a
  Prelat ought to haue to the Vine, his Spouse. To this marriage, the interest of
  Wealth, the respect of Honour, nor the pleasures of this Life, must not mooue
  him; but the good only of the Vine, and the desire he hath to take paines
  therein, till, like salt in water himselfe shall wast away and consume. He that
  enters vpon Gods patrimony, must enter there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon with a far different end to
  that, which he doth, who enters vpon that of the King; for this (commonly)
  makes his owne priuate benefit the marke whereat he aymes: But the Prelat, must
  make another mans profit, the pinne which hee must hit. The Minister of a King,
  takes a lesser charge first vpon him, that it may serue as a step to greater

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, There is not any Plant, whose Fruit doth more liuely
  represent the essence of our nature. The Flower of the Vine represents vnto vs
  our child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; the beautie thereof, it's peaceablenesse, it's prettinesse,
  it's wittinesse, it's pleasingnesse, it's innocencie: The sharpenesse and
  sourenesse thereof beeing greene, our youths hardnesse, harshnesse, tartnesse,
  and vnseasonablenesse. The Grape it selfe growne to perfection, the sweet,
  sauourie, discreet, and ripe yeares of our life, whereof that wine is made
  which glads the heart of man, and washes away care. In the Raysons, which by
  the heat of the Sunne proouing both sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorie and wholesome, serue for physicke,
  is our old age represented vnto vs; which ought to be the Antidote of youth. It
  is that discourse which doth ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice vs, that we ought not to despaire of our
  tart and distastefull youthfulnesse; for the greene and soure Grape comes not
  onely to be a ripe one, but turnes also to be a Rayson; and your young wild
  Lads come not onely to be stayd and well gouernd men, but proue likewise graue,
  wise, &amp; antient old Senators in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth. <hi>Themistocles</hi>
  was such a young lewd fellow, that his father did dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inherite him, and his
  mother for verie griefe hung her selfe; yet it was his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune afterwards to
  come to be a most valiant Captaine, and to prooue a most pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Gouernour.
  The like hapned to <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> and to <hi>Apolemon,</hi> (so saith
  <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerius Maximus</hi>) and to <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> (as
  <hi>Fulgosius</hi> reporteth it vnto vs.) <hi>Aristotle</hi> (according vnto
  <hi>Aelian</hi>) in his younger yeares played away all his Patrimonie; he
  followed the warres; he found that that course did not fit well with him, hee
  turnes Apothecarie, frequents the Schooles, and prooues in the end the Prince
  of Phylosophers.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, All sorts of Trees, be they barren or fruitfull,<note place="margin">The vine hath no bounds, no more hath the will of man.</note> they
  haue their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall heigth and bredth, either more or lesse, according to
  their seuerall kindes; your Pines and your Cedars are the tallest of all
  others; your Wallnuts round like a Cup, and more spredding at the top: In a
  word, euerie one hath his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient stature and proportion. But the Vine hath
  no determinate either heigth or bredth; if you let it alone, it will traile
  vpon the ground, &amp; so the fruit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of rot vpon the earth; if you let it
  leane vnto a pole, it will runne vp to the top thereof; if to an Elme, it will
  creepe vp to the highest boughes; if to a wall, it will runne and shoot it
  selfe along, till it hath claspt it in it's armes, and quite ouerspred it. And
  this is the verie Image and true stampe of man; for, all li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing beasts and
  other creatures whatsoeuer, hauing their termes and bounds of augmentation,
  which they may not passe and exceed; Man, through his free wil, fauoured and
  assisted by Grace, doth enioy so great an excellencie, that hee can by the
  helpe thereof leaue behind him the highest Mountaines, reaching by
  par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation, to Gods owne Beeing and abiding. And though he cannot shoot vp
  thus high of himselfe, (beeing no better than a sillie Worme of the earth) yet
  being raised vp by Grace, he may climbe vp to this happinesse,<note place="margin">The spouse compared to the vine. <hi>Cant.</hi> 8.5.</note> and
  flourish for euer in that eternall and glorious Paradise of Heauen. The
  Holy-Ghost hath compared the Spouse to a Wall, &amp; her brests, to the
  branches of the Vine, which <pb n="256" facs="tcp:22083:139"/> goe clasping and compassing
  the same about. And in another place the Angells aske, <hi>Who is this that
  commeth vp out of the Wildernesse, leaning vpon her Welbeloued?</hi> Yee need
  not wonder so much at it, for it is the Vine, which desereth to be ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in
  perpetuall loue with Christ; and hauing so good a prop, it cannot but reach to
  the highest part of Heauen. In a word, Thou maist, ô Lord, mold man like
  a peece of waxe; if thou wilt, thou canst make a Deuill of him, as thou didst
  of <hi>Iudas</hi>; and if thou wilt, thou canst make an Angell of him, as thou
  didst of <hi>Iohn Baptist:</hi> Thou canst make a just man mount aboue the
  Clouds, and to sore vp to the highest part of Heauen; And on the contrarie,
  thou canst maxe a sinner to sinke downe as low as the deepest dungeon in
  Hell.</p>

  Who made a Winepresse therein? Who built a Tower to it? The husbandmen? No, it
  was God: Is it much then, that hee should looke for the Fruits thereof?</p>
               <p>Secondly, God herein did them a great and singular fauour: For
  Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith,<note place="margin">God requireth nothing at our

  Peace, Long suffering, Gentlenesse, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, Faith, Meekenesse, and

  is pleased to call them his Fruits; for in all our actions he principally
  desireth our good and our profit: God being equally ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured in punishing the
  Bad,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iob.</hi> 35 7.</note> as in rewarding the Good.
  <hi>If thou be righteous, what giuest thou vnto him,</hi> or what receiueth he
  at thyne hand? What addest thou to his glorie? (saith <hi>Iob</hi> and

  praising and seruing of him, we acknowledge him to be our God, and therein
  submit our selues to his diuine will, whereby we come to receiue a great
  reward. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, That when we make vowes and promises

  foresees will come to passe; Who of vs should be left aliue, or who of vs
  should bee borne? Onely the Innocent (saith <hi>Theodoret</hi>) should then be
  fauoured. And therefore rather than it should bee so, he was willing to put it
  vpon the venture, how or what we might prooue heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. He knew before hand,
  that <hi>Lucifer</hi> should fall; that <hi>Adam</hi> should sin; that

  vpon them. S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> asketh the question, Why Christ would make
  choice of <hi>Iudas,</hi> when as he knew before hand that he would betray him?
  And his answer thereunto is, That it was to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie his loue, and to shew the
  great desire that he had that all should bee saued, yea, euen <hi>Iudas</hi>
  himselfe: And therefore (knowing his couetous disposition) hee made him his
  Purse-bearer, that he might shut the doore to his excuses, and that he might
  not haue iust cause to say, That he was in want, &amp; lackt mony, &amp; so was
  forced out of meere necessitie, to betray and sel his Master, which otherwise
  he would neuer haue done: but the deliuering ouer the Purse vnto him, tooke
  away that obiection. Well then, What can this Traitor say for himselfe? That
  Christ did not countenance him as he did the rest, or that hee made light
  recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of him? Neither will this hold water; for hee had made him an
  Apostle, hee was listed in the rolle with the rest, hee wrought miracles as
  well as his Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, &amp; receiued many other fauours from his Masters
  hands. The same reason may serue as well for the Iewes, as <hi>Iudas:</hi> For

                  <hi>Come, let vs kill him.</hi> Verie fitly is Sinne called a
  breake-necke, or a down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall; not onely in regard of that heigth from whence
  the Sinner falls, and the deepenesse of the pit whereinto hee is to descend;
  but because of his retchles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and his carelesnesse, by falling headlong
  from one sinne into another, til he come to the bottome of all villanie and
  wickednesse. And this is the reason why the Scripture makes so much reckoning
  of the first sinne we commit. The first sinne that <hi>Saul</hi> committed, was
  the pittie that he shewed to <hi>Amaleck</hi>: And though in it selfe it were
  not so grieuous a sinne, yet hee perseuered afterwards in enuying and
  persecuting <hi>Dauid</hi>;<note place="margin">1. <hi>Kings.</hi> 22.</note> hee
  committed great cruelties in Nob, as a Moore could not doe more; he slew
  fourescore and fiue Priests that wore a Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen Ephod: And because his faults
  were so heinous, the Scripture mentioneth not any one saue that of his pittie
  towards <hi>Amaleck</hi>; because that was the first round in the Ladder,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Psal.</hi> 1.</note> by which he fell afterwards downe into
  Hell. <hi>Beatus vir qui non abijt, Blessed is the man that hath not walked in

  Scornefull.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are three happinesses that a man is said to enioy:</p>
               <p>The one, Not to fall into the pit of Sinne.</p>
               <p>The other, If he doe fall, not to continue long therein.</p>
               <p>The third, That if he doe perseuer in sinne, that he bee not
  bewitched there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, nor make it his Seat. For Sinne (according to Saint
  <hi>Austen</hi>) produceth Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome, and Custome, a necessitie of sinning.</p>
               <p>Thus doth God punish one sinne with another, a lesser sinne with
  a greater; which is the greatest and seuerest rigour which the Tribunall of
  Gods Iustice inflicteth.<note place="margin">Gods course in punishing of sinne,
 is to reuenge the lesser with the greater.</note> 
                  <hi>Seneca</hi> tells vs,
  <hi>The prime and principall punishment of a Sinner, is his sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi>; for
  then, God falls presently a punishing sinne vpon sinne. The Scripture reckoning
  vp all the sinnes of <hi>Herod,</hi> as his tyrannies, cruelties, his swinish
  nature, and his incestuous life; it addeth, <hi>super haec omnia,</hi> (as
  though all the rest in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of this were as nothing) That hee had
  beheaded Saint <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he preached Truth vnto him. And
  this was the greatest vengeance that God could take of his former sinnes. With
  <hi>Vria's</hi> murder, God reuenged <hi>Dauids</hi> adultrie: And
  <hi>Nathans</hi> reproouing him was the appeasing of Gods wrath against him.
  For if God should not haue vsed this his mercy towards him, what would haue
  become of <hi>Dauid?</hi> Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> expounding those words which
  Christ vttered vnto <hi>Peter, Thou shalt denie me thrice</hi>; saith, That
  this placing of these three denialls, was not onely a foretelling of them, but
  of setting likewise a bound and limit vnto them, to the end that hee should not
  denie his Master any more than three times. God reuenged his first deniall, by
  his second, being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to forsweare, That he knew him not; and his second,
  by the third, aggraua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the same with so many protestations and
  <hi>Anathema's.</hi> But if Christ had not looked backe vpon him, and taken
  pittie of him, what would haue become of poore <hi>Peter?</hi> But vpon the
  sinnes of the Pharisees our Sauiour did not put any taxe or limitation,
  <hi>That all the bloud of the Iust might light vpon their heads</hi>; For they
  were a reprobate kind of people. The liues of the Prophets he reuenged by the
  death of his Sonne and heire: He reuenged the euill workes which they had done,
  in that the Light beeing brought into the World, they shut vp them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in
  Darkenesse. And with this suteth that of <hi>Esay,</hi> Thou hast made their
  owne iniquities the instruments, and as it were the hands to dash them in
  pieces. <pb n="265" facs="tcp:22083:143"/> Thou hast made them subiect to their sinnes,

                  <hi>He setteth vp a meane man in their

  starres of Heauen. We see the house of <hi>Ieroboam</hi> destroyed and vtterly

  <hi>Salmanazer,</hi> carried away tenne of the Tribes captiue to the land of

  therefore I shall make them to acknowledge it, by taking these things from

               <p>Thirdly, Hee aduiseth the Faithfull, to procure to preserue the

  multiplie the motiues of this his longing to be gadding abroad. But the malne
  Motiue was, that hee was yong, and desirous of libertie. He that names the

  quicknesse in entertaining them, and a foolish rashnesse in inioying them.
  Through a foolish longing, <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue</hi> lost the greatest
  Empire that euer was acknowledged by the World, in lesse than six houres; being
  presently turned out of Gods blessing (as they say) into the warme Sunne; and

  through the circle of Heauen.</hi> In a word, this yong man did seeke to shake
  off from his shoulders all those obligations, which the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of his father
  might lay vpon him. But it seemeth to Saint <hi>Austen,</hi> that the cause of
  his perdition, was Pride, his not acknowledging of subiection, nor
  su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perioritie. This was the sinne of <hi>Lucifer</hi> in Heauen, and of
  <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradice. <hi>Initium superbiae hominis apostatare a Deo.</hi>
  This doctrine of Saint <hi>Austens,</hi> hath a great deale of reason on it's
  side, as is obserued by <hi>Thomas</hi>: For all other vices make a man goe
  departing from God by degrees, wheeling about as it were, and fetching a
  compasse; but Pride standing out stiffe against God, and seeking as it were to
  out face him, fals presently to an absolute neglect of his diuine Maiestie. But
  it fareth with him as with the Sunne in those parts when it sets, it sinkes on
  the sudden, and it is instantly night: So when the Proude man fals, he fals
  sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, <pb n="274" facs="tcp:22083:148"/> and a present darkenesse ouerspreds his
  soule, beeing throwne headlong downe into the bottomelesse pit of Hell, where
  the blacke mantle of eternall darkenesse shall be cast ouer him.</p>
               <p>The third motiue (according to <hi>Petrus Crysologus</hi>) was
  couetousnesse of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney: This (saith he) draue him out of his fathers doores,
  banished him from his Countrie, blotted his fame, and blemished his honour,
  left him naked &amp; poore, and made him submit himselfe to the basest seruice
  in the world. And this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit hath in its fauour a verie forcible reason; for
  the libertie of Youth, though it would runne on to it's owne destruction, yet
  without money it is lame, it wants both it's hands and it's feet; and this
  defect doth detaine him, as a woodden clog doth a mad Bullocke. But when Youth
  shall be left to it's own swinge, and bee still supplied and fed with moneys,
  which are the instruments of mischiefe in il gouerned yeres; Who can restrain
  it, or what hand (though neuer so strong) hold it in?</p>
               <p>But to omit these and many other motiues elsewhere deliuered by
  vs; <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Alexandrinus</hi> saith, That one of the greatest affronts
  that Man can do vnto God, is, for to forgoe the comfort and libertie of his
  owne house, to follow the World, the Flesh, and the Deuill. Saint
  <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, That it is a woful thing, that all that should seeme
  honie to a man, which is offered him by the Deuil; and all that gall, which is
  profered him by God. It is a more naturall thing in the Creature, to obey their
  Creator, than to follow their owne proper inclination. The natural place of the
  water was to couer the earth, [<hi>Et aqua erant super faciem abissi</hi>] but
  God commanding them to retyre themselues, they did instantly obey his voyce.
  The libertie which the Angells enioy, is more perfect than that of man; yet
  cannot they diuert their will from the will of God. What saith <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon? My
  sonne, receiue my councell, and hearken to the instruction that I shall giue

  than that thou shouldest looke vp to the hands of thy children.</hi> To this
  doubt, satisfaction hath formerly beene giuen by vs in a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of ours
  vpon this same Parable: but that which now offers it selfe a fresh vnto vs, is
  That albeit the Father saw, that his libertie, his monys, &amp; his absence,
  would be his Sonnes vndoing; yet hee likewise saw his amendment, his
  repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and what a future warning this would be vnto him. And so hee chose
  ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to see him recouered after he was lost, than violently to detaine him,
  and to force him to keepe home against his will; which would bring forth no
  better fruits than lowring and grumbling. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, That
  it seemed a lesser euill to God, to redresse some euills, than not to permit
  any euill at all; <hi>Melius judicauit de malis benefacere, quam mala nulla
  esse permittere.</hi> God would not haue thee to sinne, neither can he be the
  Author of thy sinnes: but if men should not commit sinnes, Gods Attributes
  would lose much of their splendor. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> speaking of himselfe,
  saith, That God had forgiuen him, though he had beene a persecuter and
  blasphemer of his holy Name, &amp;c. And why did hee doe this? <hi>Vt
  ostenderet omnem patientiam &amp; gratiam</hi>; My sinnes (saith he) were the

               <p>First of all, hee leuelled all accounts with his father,
  shutting the doore after him to all hope of receiuing so much as one farthing
  more than his portion: If he had left some stocke behind him, that might haue
  holpe him at a pinch, if he should chance to miscarrie in this his journey,
  (for he was not sure that he should still hold Fortune fast by the wing) he had
  done well and wisely; but he made a cleane riddance of all, as well mooueables,
  as immooueables: <hi>Et congregatis omnibus, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, What a foolish part was it in him, to leaue so good a
  Father, and so sweet and pleasant a Countrie, being both such naturall tyes of
  loue to Mans brest. The loue of a Father is so much indeered in Scripture, that
  great curses and maledictions are thundred out against vnlouing and vnkind
  childeren. And the loue of a mans Countrie is such a thing, (saith Saint
  <hi>Augustine</hi>) that God made choice to trie of what mettal
  <hi>Abraham</hi> was made, by such a new &amp; strange kind of torment, as to
  turne him out of his Countrie; <hi>Egredere de Terra tua, &amp; de Cognatione
  tua, Goe from thy Land, and from thy Kindred.</hi> Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi>
  saith, That euen those Monkes which left the world for their loue to God, and
  to doe him seruice, did notwithstanding shew themselues verie sencible of their
  ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence from their natiue soyle, and their fathers house. But those sorrowes
  and lamentations which the Children of Israell made when they were on their way
  to Babylon, indeere it beyond measure; <hi>If I forget thee, ô
  Ierusalem,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

               <p>
                  <pb n="276" facs="tcp:22083:149"/>But much more fearefull is the resolution
  of this young man, in the thing that is signified thereby: To wit, That a
  Sinner shall so exactly summe vp all his rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>konings with God, that he shall
  not haue any hope at all left him, neither in his life nor his death, of one
  onely dramme of mercie. There are some Sinners that giue their wealth to the
  World, but not all; some giue God their lips, but not their hearts; some, their
  memorie, but not their will; some, their will, but not their vnderstanding;
  some are dishonest, and yet Almesgiuers; some coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, and yet deuout, like
  those Assyrians which liued in Samaria, who acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged God &amp; his Law,
  yet worshipped Idolls. But to giue all away, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digall did, is a
  desperate course.</p>
               <p>Besides, It is a miserable case, that this Prodigall should not
  bee sencible of leauing so good a Father as God, of renouncing so rich an
  Inheritance as Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and of being banished for euer from so sweet and

  Whilest <hi>Dauid</hi> was quiet in his Kingdome, <hi>Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mei</hi> durst neuer

  him out of the Citie after him, and there before all the people, venting the
  gall of his long conceiued malice, hee falls a rayling most bitterly against
  him. <hi>I am poore and wretched</hi>: (Marke I pray,<note place="margin">

  off.</hi> Many stood looking on him, but none would come in to helpe him. Those
  friends which before made great reckoning of <hi>Iob,</hi> when they saw him
  sitting on the Dunghil, they began to scorne and despise him. Those Princes
  that were confederate with Ierusalem, forsooke her in her affliction, and left
  her all alone. <hi>Philon</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth, That the Samaritans whilest the
  Iewes were in prosperitie stucke verie close vnto them, and esteemed of them as
  of their friends and Kinsemen. <hi>Art thou greater than our Father Iacob?</hi>
  said the Samaritane woman; calling <hi>Iacob</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as long as the Iewes
  power and prosperitie lasted; but no sooner downe the wind, but they wind their
  neckes out of the coller, acknowledging neither friendship nor kindred. Of
  those Fishes which they call <hi>Vigiliales,</hi> your Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralists doe report,
  That when the Starres are cleere, and shine bright, they come and skip and play
  aboue water, seeming therein to applaud their beautie, and to sooth and flatter
  them; but when they are dimme and darke, they likewise hide their heads and get
  them gone. Of your Batts or Reare-mice (as some cal them) Fables report, That
  when the Birds came to demaund tribute of them, shewing them their brests, they
  sayd they were Beasts; And when the Beasts came to them, &amp; craued the like,
  shewing their wings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they pleaded they were Birds. In a word,
  Quicke-siluer, which is such a profest friend vnto Gold, flies from it in the
  Crysole. All flie from the Crysole of pouertie, they will not indure to come to
  the melting pot, that is too hot a triall for them. <hi>Martial</hi> said of
  <hi>Homer,</hi> That if he brought nothing along with him but the Muses, hee
  should haue <hi>Tom Drummes</hi> entertainement, and be shut out of doores.
  Your Whore, if you haue no money in your purse wil bid you be gone; No penie

  hungrie, and what shift to make he knowes not; for, after a fulnesse comes a
  Famine, and after bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie, beggerie, especially when men will wilfully cast

  house that he had in the Countrie, to keepe Swine; where hee faine would, but
  could not fill his bellie with that feeding which was flung out to the Pigges.
  This was a verie miserable change: But God many times deales thus with his
  vntoward Children, that they may see the difference that is betwixt Master and
  Master, House and House, Fare and Fare. God did deliuer <hi>Rehoboam</hi> King

  of the difference, that was from subiection to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection. God said to his

  to thy Fathers account. But this thy felicitie goes further than so:
  <hi>Salomon</hi> throughout all the third Chapter of his
  <hi>Prouerbs,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Prou.</hi> 3.</note> goes promising
  blessings to a wise and obedient Sonne; threatning many euills to come vpon
  that child that shall be crosse and vntoward to his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents. As a long and
  prosperous life hath fauor both with God and Men, health, fulnesse, Barnes
  filled with aboundance, Presses that shal burst with new Wine; summing there vp
  all possible and imaginable felicitie. But otherwise goes it with those that
  are peruerse and disobedient: <hi>Chrysologus</hi> sets them forth in the
  Prodigall, and reduceth them all to his turning Swineheard.</p>
               <p>Our Sauiour Christ stiles Sinners with the name of Swine: And
  this name doth more particularly appertaine to those that are sensuall persons.
  The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions are many.</p>
               <p>First of all, Any other Creature whatsoeuer is made tame &amp;
  gentle, but the swine not; in any other there is taken some pleasure or
  affection, but in the Swine not; any other will acknowledge the hand that feeds
  him, but the Swine neuer; it is the stampe of an obstinate, harsh, vnsauorie,
  and desperate sinner.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In touching a Hogs either bristles or skinne, hee
  presently falls a grunting, as <hi>Geminianus</hi> hath noted it. A Horse will
  suffer you to curry his coat, and to kembe downe his mayn; there are many other
  beasts that will giue a man leaue to handle &amp; stroke them; but the Hog is
  no sooner toucht but he whines, and the reason is, because there is nothing
  either of profit or pleasure in him, saue his flesh: so that when you offer to
  lay hand on him, he presently conceiues that you meane to kill him. This is the
  picture of a Sinner that hath a guiltie consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, who being scarce toucht,
  not with the whole hand, but the least and lightest finger of Gods justice,
  presently apprehends he is but a dead man.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Your Swine, especially your wilde Bores, are of that
  strange quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of sent, that if the Huntsman meane to shoot at him, he
  must take the wind of him, or else he will wind him out and be gone. Now on the
  contrarie, they are not sencible of the ill sauour of a Dunghill, nor the
  stench of mud and mire, but rather take delight to lie wallowing therein,
  esteeming it as a great recreation and refreshing vnto them. This is the figure
  of a filthie foule Sinner, who will flie a thousand leagues from the perills
  and dangers of his bodie, but take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and pastime in those muckhills and
  durtie puddles which defile the Soule. And these kind of creatures your
  Worldlings cal their loue, their joy, their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort <pb n="279" facs="tcp:22083:150"/> and
  delight. But Gods Dictionary termes them, the loathsome sweetnesses and
  perbreaking pleasures ofSwine.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, In point of stinking nastinesse, and all kind of
  beastly filthinesse, a Swine is such a filthie thing, that a slouenly fellow we
  commonly call him <hi>Puer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co,</hi> a verie Swine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He would faine haue filled his bellie with the husks that
  the Swine eat, but no man gaue them him.</hi> There are many Pictures and
  Tables in Scripture, in the Saints,

  sinner from himselfe; yet dishonesty doth this more than all the rest.
  <hi>Salomon,</hi> treating of the tyranny of a Whoore, sayth, That shee is like
  a Theefe, which lyes in waite in the way, to set vpon carelesse men, and kill
  them ere they are aware. <hi>Et quos incautos viderit, interficit.</hi> A
  theefe dares not set vpon him that goes well accompanied, or that hath his
  pistolls at his Saddlebow, and is well prouided for him. The Deuill sets vpon
  vs with the inticements of the flesh; against these allurements, wee must arme
  our selues with prayer, fasting, &amp; mortification. But the carelesse man
  which lyes open, and offers himselfe euery moment to al occasions of sinning,
  that man he either robs, or kils, if not both; and leaues him so wholly besides

  before hee became sinn's slaue. And when God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serues a sinner in his sinne,
  and forbeares to punish him according to his ill deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uings, it ought to bee a
  great motiue vnto him, to make him to leaue it. It is a case worthy great
  admiration, that in that so generall a destruction which the Babilonians made

                  <hi>Make me one of thy hired Seruants. Gilbertus</hi> the Abbot
  saith, That these were verie humble and submissiue thoughts, as he was a Sonne,
  but somewhat too af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronting for so free and liberal a Father: say his
  deseruings were neuer so poore, neuer so meane, such weake hopes, and such a
  base opinion could not but bee a great iniurie to so good and gratious a
  Father. <hi>Gregorie Nazianzen</hi> saith of him, <hi>Others cannot receiue
  more willingly, than he giues cheerefully.</hi> To the Couetous and to the
  Needy, there is not any content comparable to that of receiuing; yet grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
  is the contentment which God taketh in giuing. He reuealed to <hi>Abraham</hi>
  his purposed punishment vpon Sodome, and onely because he should beg and
  intreat for their pardon: and this Patriarke was sooner wearie in suing, than
  God in granting. And if God did demand his Sonne of him, it was not with an
  intent to haue him sacrifice him, (for hee diuerted that Sacrifice) but to take
  occasion thereby to giue him a type of the offering vp of his owne Sonne:
  giuing a sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of desert to that which came not within the compasse of
  desert. What says the Abbot <hi>Guaricus?</hi> He that gaue his sonne for the
  redeeming of Prodigalls, What can he denie vnto them.<note place="margin">Gods

  the World gaines a great opinion, when with a great deale of leisure, and a
  great deale of difficultie, it slowly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds in doing good; but God, he
  loseth this respect through his too much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitie and frankenesse in his
  doing of his courtesies. The Gentiles (saith this learned Doctor) judging of
  Faith by outward appearances, could not be persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that such facile and mean
  things in outward shew, could inwardly cause such supernaturall effects, and
  such diuine Graces, as in that blessed Sacrament of Baptisme.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When he was yet a great way off, &amp;c.</hi> The Prodigall
  desired that his Father would intertaine him into his seruice as an hired
  seruant; and hee had no sooner sight of him, but he ran with open armes to
  receiue him, and was so ouerioyed to see him, and made him that cheere, that
  the Prodigall knew not how now to vnfold his former conceiued words. Saint
  <hi>Iohn</hi> in forme of a Citie saw that coelestiall Ierusalem; and saith,
  That it had twelue gates, and in each of them an Angell; which did typifie two
  things vnto vs:</p>
               <p>The one, That the gates were open.</p>

  afarre off, but he hasted out of his house to imbrace him, &amp; presently puts
  him into a new suit of cloaths, that others might not see how totterd and torne
  he was returned home. But God went a step further than all this, for hee
  repaires to him to the Pigges-stie to put good thoughts into his head. Loue
  vseth to make extraordinarie haste in relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the wants of those persons

  <hi>Omnem Scripturam iniquam:</hi> Saint <hi>Hierome, Chirographa.</hi> And to
  the end that the drift of this Language may be the better vnderstood; it is to
  be noted, That a man when he sinnes, sells himselfe to the Deuill; making this
  sale good vnder his owne hand writing. The Deuill, hee buyes; and the Man, he
  sells; and the Damned confesse as much in Hell; <hi>Wee haue driuen a bargaine
  with Death, and haue made a couenant with Hell.</hi> And if the Deuill had
  proceeded herein fairely &amp; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly, and according to Law and Iustice,
  this knot would hardly haue beene vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knit: but for that he is a Father of
  falsehood, of deceit, and of cosinage, there are three great annullities to be
  found in this his Contract.</p>
               <p>First, An enormious &amp; excessiue losse; buying that Soule for
  little or nothing, which cost an infintte price; <hi>Gratis venundati
  estis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, A notorious cosinage; in that he promised that which
  hee was not able to performe; <hi>Sicut Dij.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Mans being vnder yeares; it beeing a ruled Case, That
  any such sale, without the consent of the Guardian, is of no validitie in Law:
  And that too, must be for the benefit of the Ward.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, That he that inhabits another mans house, if he vse
  the same amisse, the Law takes order that he bee turned out of it. Now, the
  Deuill inhabiting this house of man, makes a dunghill thereof, and besides,
  payes no rent for it: to the Bodie, Fastings are payable; to the Soule,
  Prayers; to the Goods, Almes: and these debts, are so many darts in the Deuills
  sides.</p>
               <p>It did belong therefore to our Sauiour Christ, as being our
  elder brother, and the Guardian of our Soules, to disanull this sale. Saint
  <hi>Paul</hi> saith, That whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer act <hi>Adam</hi> had done, as the chiefe
  head and principall root of Mankind, our Sauiour Christ had now cancelled the
  same vpon the Crosse,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Coloss.</hi> 2.14.</note>
                  <hi>Putting out the hand writing of Ordinances that was against vs; which was
  contrarie vnto vs, he euen tooke it out of the way, and fastned it vpon the
  Crosse.</hi> And for as much as euerie man through his manifold sinnes sells
  himselfe ouer and ouer to the Deuill, not once, but many times; it was fitting
  that our Sauiour Christ should as often blot and cancell this bill, and make it
  to be of none effect. And here saith our Euangelist, <hi>Erat Iesus eijciens
  Daemonium, Iesus was casting forth a Deuill.</hi> This word <hi>Erat</hi>
  im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the difficultie of getting him out, as also the long time of his

  Deuil, but stayed and paused a while vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the matter; shewing thereby, that it
  was not so easie a thing to bee done as some thought it to be, but rather full
  of difficultie. What, can there bee any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie for God to doe? Is it
  possible that any thing should seeme hard vnto him? The Saints of God, and
  learned Doctours of the Church, render some reasons thereof on our part, some
  on the Deuills, and some on our Sauiour Christs.</p>
               <p>On our part, God hauing free and absolute power ouer our Will,
  Who is able to oppugne his omnipotency?<note n="(1.)" place="margin">On our
 part.</note> When <hi>Lucifer,</hi> &amp; his followers playd the Rebels in
  Heauen, it seeming to God too base an Office to punish them by his owne person,
  he commanded Saint <hi>Michaell</hi> the Arch-Angell, that hee should throw 
  <pb n="285" facs="tcp:22083:153"/> them thence like thunderbolts. These Deuills, beeing
  thus tumbled downe headlong from that so high a Tower, they sought out another
  stronger hold wherein to defend themselues, which was Man; and making
  themselues masters of this Fort, they made fast the Windowes, and the Doores,
  shutting close the Eyes, Eares, and Mouth of Man. God himselfe in our person,
  laboured to put them out. But Man, abusing that libertie which God hath left
  vnto him, &amp; resig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it vp into the Deuills hands, is the onely cause
  that they maintaine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend this Fort against God. <hi>Gregorie
  Nazianzen</hi> saith, That wee play the Traytors, and conspire against God,
  against his Crosse, and against his Bloud, by selling our selues dayly anew
  vnto the Deuill. Our Sauiour Christ had payd the ransome for all our sinnes
  vpon the Crosse, tearing that our handwriting &amp; obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation in pieces,
  which we had made ouer to the Deuil. But we, as if we repented our selues
  thereof, make him a new bond, and bind our selues anew vnto him; Which is a
  great basenesse in Man. Wilt thou receiue an Apostata, a Traitour, a Fugitiue,
  and one that is condemned for euer to the Gallies? There is no Inne halfe so
  vile, or so bad as thy Soule. For, if this harbour a theefe, or a murderer, or
  a robber on the highway-side, it is vpon hope of profit: But thou doost not
  onely giue him entertainement, but also spendest thy purse vpon him, and doost
  protect and abett him against God. So that God hath a great deale more to doe
  with poore silly Man, being but as a worme of the earth, than with the greatest
  Deuill in Hell.</p>
               <p>There is also another reason on our part; To wit, The so often
  repeating of our sins ouer and ouer, their antient standing, and their
  spreading (like a Cancker) still farther &amp; farther vpon our soules;
  Insomuch, that it will find God worke, &amp; can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not chuse but cost him much
  labor. And the sores of our sins may be in that des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perat case, that he is not
  able to cure them by ordinary means, but must vse therin some great and strange
  Miracle. Thou puttest foorth to Sea, thou saylest in the same ship with another
  passenger, thy friend and acquaintance, ye Cabbin toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, eat together,
  and sleepe together, continuing in this louing league of friendship, some six
  moneths or more. Thou boordest thy selfe with thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, liuest vnder the
  same roofe with him some thirty yeares and vpwards, and all this while ye
  continue verie good freinds. Sure it must be a very great occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion that must
  part yee twaine, and either coole, or blot out this your so long grounded
  affection. But, if besides this tye of friendship, thou take extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
  contentment in it, there is no gaine-saying of it. Such a one, thou art wont to
  say; she is my Life, my Soule, my deere Heart, deerer vnto mee than mine owne
  eyes. Though thou hast liued thus and thus many yeares, and so much to thy
  content and delight in conuersation and friendship with the Deuil, &amp; though
  I must confesse, it is a hard matter to come off handsomely from him, yet God
  hath wrought thy freedom, but at a great price, and hath brought thee off
  cleere but with much paine. But let me tell thee withall, that when thy
  demoniated soule, shall place all it's whole pleasure and delight in the Deuils
  company, make him her best beloued, &amp; hug him in her armes, and spred out
  the lappet of her garment for him; then shal it be in my Letanie, Lord haue
  mercie vpon thee. For when sinne growes to that height, it is almost out of
  reach, to doe any good vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it. Pope <hi>Clement</hi> saith of <hi>Simon

  had made such an inseperable knot with the Deuill, <hi>Que quien le apartara,
  le matara, That he that should pull him from him, must pull away life and soule
  together.</hi> Saint <hi>Marke</hi> tels vs, That his Disciples being not able
  to dispossesse a young man of the Deuill, <pb n="286" facs="tcp:22083:154"/> they brought
  him to our Sauiour Christ. And hee demaunding of them that brought him vnto
  him, how long he had beene tormented with him; They an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, From his
  childhood. Our Sauiour healed him; But I remember the Text sayes, <hi>Factus
  est sicut mortuus, ita vt multi dicerent, quia iam mortuus est, Hee was as one
  dead, in so much that many sayd, He is dead.</hi> This young man was so wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
  to the Deuill, that many could not pull him from him; and being taken from the
  Deuill, he was as a dead man. He had kept him companie so long, that the Deuill
  was to him, as his life. And this is the marke of such persons as giue
  them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues ouer to the pleasures of this World: For liuing without them but
  three dayes in the Holy-weeke, they thinke themselues dead.</p>
               <p>
                  <note n="(2.)" place="margin">Reasons on the Deuils part.</note>On
  the Deuils part, there are likewise many forcible reasons.</p>
               <p>First of all, This foule Fiend leaues a Soule so blind, so
  deafe, and so dumbe, that he doth not feele the hurt of so infamous a dwelling.
  And therefore the Church vseth to pray against the Spirit of Fornication.
  <hi>Seneca</hi> calls a woman, The Sepulchre of Vice; and there is no dumbe man
  so dumbe, nor no blind man so blind, as hee that lies dead in the Graue; nor no
  lesse blind and dumbe, as hee that is buried in the fond affection of a woman:
  <hi>Melior est iniquitas viri, quam be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefaciens mulier. Thy enemie will doe
  thee lesse harme than thy Mistresse</hi>: The worst that he can doe, is to kill
  thee and take away thy life; but she will take from thee thy goods, thy life,
  and thy soule. <hi>Dauid</hi> giuing thankes vnto God for freeing him from his
  former troubles,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Psal.</hi> 126.</note> sayd,
  <hi>Dirupisti Domine vincula mea, Thou hast bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, ô Lord, my bonds in
  sunder.</hi> What bonds were those? <hi>Ecclesiasticus</hi> answers,
  <hi>Vincula sunt manus illis, The embracements of a woman.</hi> And in another
  place hee saith, <hi>Eruisti animam meam ex inferno inferiori, Thou hast
  brought my soule out of the lowermost Hell.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Psal.</hi> 86.</note> It seemeth that he stileth this
  lowermost Hel, his Adulterie: and that this should bee the sence of it, there
  is great reason for it; for that is the lowermost Hell from whence God
  (speaking according to our vnderstanding) can draw a man out with greatest
  difficultie. For though God could with a great deale of ease haue taken
  <hi>Iudas</hi> out of the Hell of the Damned, yet hee could nor but by some
  extraordinarie meanes, feteh him from the Hell of his treason. <hi>Iob</hi>
  jumping vpon this conceit, drawes his comparison from the hard labour of a
  woman in trauell; <hi>Obstetricante manu eius, eductus est coluber
  tortuosus.</hi> Wherein we are to consider the diligences which a Midwife
  vseth, when that which is to be borne, comes athwart, &amp; crosses nature in
  it's common course: but what a doo would there be, if this birth should prooue
  to be a Snake or a Serpent?</p>
               <p>Secondly, The difficultie lies not so much in the Deuills
  strength, as in his subtiltie.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.</note>
                  <hi>Erat Serpens calidior omnibus animalibus terrae.</hi> He doth not say he
  was stronger, but subtiler: For, to hunt in thicke and bushie Mountaines, we
  had need of more trickes and deuices, than if we did hunt in an open and
  champian Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie: We must haue good store of weapons, ginnes, nets, and
  Ferrets, which may creepe in without any noyse. <hi>Ipse liberauit me de laqueo
  venancium.</hi> The <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calyps</hi> paints out the Deuill in the forme of a

  of a man, the haires of a woman, and the mouth of a Lyon. Hee compares him to a
  Locust, because he deuoures and destroyes all: His meanes, he maketh, Mans
  deceiuing, Womans inticing, and the Lyons crueltie.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The difficultie likewise consisteth in the Deuills
  pertinacie and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinacie, who neuer ceaseth to plie and importune thee: And
  if at any time thou make thy peace with God, the Deuill will not suffer it to
  last long; and conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it but into a truce for a time, he returnes backe
  againe to this cleane (as thou thinkest) swept house of thine: but the broome,

  secure, especially where there is an impossibilitie of peace. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill being

  thee vnprouided? That Soldier which whilest the warre lasts leaueth off his
  Armes, and carelessely walkes vp and downe; such occasions may offer themselues
  vnto him, that he may too late repent him of his follie. That vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Captaine

  themselues into a Sommer Parlor where they sate all alone, (there being warres
  betweene them at that time) putting forth his left hand, and taking a dagger
  from his right thigh, he thrust it into his bellie, and the haft entring in
  after the blade, it was buried in the fat that was about it. Whereas this King,
  had he done well, hee should not (considerng there was warre betweene them)
  haue gone disarmed. What saith Saint <hi>Paul</hi> vnto thee, <hi>Accipite

  hardly beleeue it. To conquer the Deuill thou wilt thinke it no great matter,
  and that the victorie is not so glorious as it makes shew for. Bee it so: but

  <hi>Chrysostome</hi> saith, That God placeth shame, in sinne; and comfort, in
  confession. Whereas the Deuill, in sinne, placeth presumption; and and in
  confession, shame. <hi>Plutarch</hi> saith, That as a moderate shame, is a
  guard to innocencie, a wall to honestie, and a generall ornament to all the
  Vertues; so too much shame on the other side, is a spoile and ruine to them
  all. Saint <hi>Austen</hi> saith, That it is a foulenesse and weakenesse of our

  opened <hi>Adams</hi> mouth to eate the Apple, hee did likewise shut it vp from
  the confessing of his fault. Pope <hi>Gregorie</hi> saith, That when God did
  aske <hi>Adam, Vbi es, Where art thou?</hi> he then pretended, had hee
  willingly and readily confest his fault, not only to haue pardoned him his
  offence, but to haue restored likewise all that good which he had lost, both to
  himselfe, and his posteritie. Saint <hi>Austen</hi> is of the same opinion. And
  Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> saith, That he did not hurt himselfe more by his
  disobedience, than by seeking to excuse his sin. For this his trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression,
  had he dealt fairely and plainely with God, might perhaps haue beene 
  <pb n="289" facs="tcp:22083:155"/> repaired. And <hi>Tostatus</hi> sticketh not to

  and that God had forgiuen him his sinne (<hi>Eduxit illum à delicto suo,
  For he brought him out of his offence,</hi> as we read in the first of
  <hi>Wisedome</hi>) yet did hee neither restore vnto him his originall
  innocencie, nor that Paradice wherein he had placed him. Your Schoole Diuines
  bring many strong Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments against this opinion; but the authoritie of such

                  <hi>And that was dumbe.</hi> God gaue Man a tongue, that

  are your Preachers who sow Cushions vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Princes elbowes, and for feare of
  offending, refuse to reprehend sinne: And these <hi>Esay</hi> calls Dumbe Dogs.
  The Dog barkes at some, bites at other some, and heales others with his tongue,
  being in it selfe verie medicinable. <hi>Diogenes</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued all his

  Poets, for that they railed in their Verses against other mens il man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and
  yet neuer amended their owne misdemeanors: Musitions, that beeing able to tune
  so well their Instruments, they could neuer as yet tune their Soules aright:
  Iudiciarie Astrologers, that diuining of other mens misfortunes, they could
  neuer diuine of their owne: Lewd liuers, that hauing so many good words in
  their mouthes, they should doe such bad deeds: Couetous Misers, that
  blaspheming money in publique, they adored it in priuate: Gluttons, that
  desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring health of God, they did dayly ouerthrow their bodies by ouer-eating
  and ouerdrinking themselues till they fell a vomiting as they sate at boord: Of
  those that can be content to fare well themselues, and not bring good tydings
  to their brethren: The leaprous men in the fourth of the <hi>Kings</hi> could
  find fault therwith,<note place="margin">4. <hi>Kings</hi> 7.9.</note> when they
  said one to another, Wee doe not well; this day is a day of good ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, and
  we hold our peace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And that was dumbe.</hi> It is strange, That the Deuil
  getting so much as he dayly doth by mans speech, should labour to make him
  dumbe; more harme grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to man by the former than the latter.</p>
               <p>First, It is to bee prooued, That of a hundred that were
  possessed with De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uills, <pb n="290" facs="tcp:22083:156"/> you shall finde but one onely
  that was dumbe; they are all of them exceeding great talkers, flatterers, and
  lyers: And that they might prate the more, they talke in diuers tongues, not
  onely in that which is their owne naturall Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, but also in Latine, in
  Greeke, &amp;c. Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> hath noted it, That the Deuills
  downefall tooke it's beginning from his talking; <hi>Dicebat enim in corde suo,
  ascendam in Caelum, For he said in his heart, I will ascend vp into
  Heauen:</hi> And our destruction began with the conuersation that hee had with
  <hi>Eue. Iulian</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stata makes a jeast of it, That a Serpent should
  speake: Which Saint <hi>Ciril</hi> chose rather to proue by the testimonies of
  Phylosophers &amp; Poets, than by Scripture, because this blasphemous wretch
  gaue more credit to them, than to the Word of God. <hi>Homer</hi> sayth, That
  <hi>Vlisses</hi> his Horse spake vnto him, forewarning him of his death.
  <hi>Porphyrius</hi> saith, that <hi>Caucasus</hi> spake; &amp; that
  <hi>Pythagoras</hi> passing by, it sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted him with a <hi>Salue Pythagora.
  Phylostratus</hi> saith, That <hi>Apollonius</hi> comming to the
  <hi>Gymnosophistae,</hi> an Elme (vnder whose shade being wearie he sate him
  downe) spake vnto him, and told him, That he was verie welcome. And
  <hi>Siginius</hi> repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth of <hi>Iupiters</hi> Bull, That he spake like a
  man. If the Deuill then can speake by Horses, by Bulls, by Trees, and the like,
  hee may as well speake by a Serpent; And why not by that Serpent more than any
  other, that was to be the instrument to ouerthrow all Mankind?</p>
               <p>Secondly, Out of many places of holy Scripture, obseruations of
  the Saints of God, and out of the opinions of many learned Doctors,
  Phylosophers, and Poets, in fauor of this point, two manifest truths are proued
  to arise from hence, and haue their first beginnings.</p>
               <p>The one, That an euill tongue is the leauen of all our ill.</p>
               <p>The other, That a good tongue is the summe of all our good.</p>
               <p>The first, Experience at euerie turne teacheth it vnto vs. Whose
  are those blasphemies against God and his holy Saints, but of a sacrilegious
  tongue? Whose those inconsiderate iniuries, but of a rash and vnaduised tongue?
  Whose those infamies and detractions, but of a backbiting tongue? Whose, those
  dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honest words and lasciuious Songs, but of a filthie tongue? Whose, those
  sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of discord amongst brethren, those dissoluings of marriages, those
  blottings of mens good names, those soylings of your Clergies Coat, your
  Priests Surpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, your Bishops Rotchets, your Widowes decent dressing, your
  Maidens mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest attyre, but of a durtie slabbering tongue? Saint
  <hi>Hierome</hi> saith, That the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill left <hi>Iobs</hi> lips vntoucht,
  hoping that with them he would haue cursed God, as he promised to himselfe
  before hand; <hi>Stretch out thy hand and touch but his bones and his
  flesh,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iob.</hi> 2.5.</note> 
                  <hi>and then see if he
  will not blaspheme thee to thy face.</hi> Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith,
  <hi>Plagam suam silentio vicit, He subdued his paine by silence.</hi> And the
  selfe same father saith, That if <hi>Eue</hi> had not spoken with the Serpent,
  or if shee had but eaten the Apple, &amp; had said nothing therof to
  <hi>Adam</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we had not come to that so great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie and misfortune
  whereinto we fel. The Deuill did not desire to make <hi>Eue</hi> so much a
  Glutton, as a Pratler: her talking with <hi>Adam</hi> did vndoe vs all. S.
  <hi>Iames</hi> qualifies both these tongues.</p>
               <p>The one he termes a fire, that burns and consumes all that comes
  in it's way; and to be the onely maine cause of all mischiefe.</p>
               <p>Of the other he saith, <hi>That man is perfect that offends not
  in his tongue.</hi> In our Booke <hi>De Amore,</hi> we haue a whole Chapter
  touching this ill, and this good. But how is it possible, that the Deuill
  should seeke to fauour the ill, and disfauor the good? Saint <hi>Augustine</hi>
  answeres this in one word; This man hauing beene here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore a great talker,
  the Deuill made him dumbe, lest by confessing his faults, <pb n="291" facs="tcp:22083:156"/> he might repaire those losses which hee had runne into by
  ouerlashing with his tongue.</p>
               <p>Dumbe, deafe, blind, and possessed with a Deuill. This massacre
  which the Deuill wrought vpon the bodie of this man, represents that cruell
  massacre which he dayly executes vpon mens soules: For though he takes pleasure
  in the possession of a mans bodie, yet his maine pretence is to preiudice the
  soule, and like a Worme in wood, to eat out the verie heart and pith thereof.
  Imagine a Horse prepared for the Kings owne riding, beautifull, and richly
  betrapt; let thy thought represent such a one vnto thee, and a Rogue that hath
  neuer a shoo to his foot, nor a rag to his tayle, mounted thereupon, and
  proudly bestriding him; Imagine a bed like that of <hi>Salomons,</hi> or that
  of the Spouse, cleane, neat, and strewed with Flowers, and an Oyle-man, a
  Collyer, or a Scullion put into it; so is it with the Soule possessed by the
  Deuill.</p>
               <p>It is a common doubt, yet fit for this Storie, Why God
  permitteth that the Deuill should doe so much mischiefe to man? We know that
  this the Deuills rage towards man, began euer since that God purposed to make
  his Sonne, man; and holding himselfe affronted, that he was not an Angell, hee
  vowed and swore the death of man. And therefore it is said of him, <hi>Hee was
  a Murtherer from the beginning</hi>: And this made our Sauiour to say vnto the
  Pharisees, <hi>Yee are of your Father the Deuill, for that yee seeke to fulfill
  his will,</hi> Who putting Christ to death, did accomplish that which the
  Deuill had sworne. And hence ariseth that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and emnitie which he beareth
  to man in generall, and the harme which hee either does or seekes to doe him;
  thinking with himselfe (as <hi>Tertullian</hi> noteth it) that the greater hurt
  hee doth vnto man, the greater stones hee throwes against God. But suppose,
  That without the will of God he cannot doe vs any harme,<note place="margin">Why
 God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits him to be so mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous. 2. Mac. 3.</note> Why doth hee permit,
  that this his liuing Temple, consecrated with his holy oyle, being the
  habitation of his delight, should be made a Hogs-stie for Deuils? When
  <hi>Heliodorus</hi> prophaning the holy Temple of Ierusalem, entred thereinto,
  there met him an armed Knight in harnesse of gold, sitting vpon a fierce Horse
  richly barbed, who smote at <hi>Heliodorus</hi> with his fore-feet throwing him
  downe to the ground. This was no sooner done, but there presently appeared two
  young men, notable in strength, excellent in beautie, and comely in apparell,
  which stood by him on either side and scourged him continually, and gaue him
  many sore stripes till he was readie to giue vp the ghost: and all the People
  prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the Lord, that he had honoured his owne place with so great and
  strange a miracle. But <hi>Heliodorus</hi> escaped in the end with life, at the
  intercession of <hi>Onias</hi> the High-Priest: And the King asking
  <hi>Heliodorus</hi> afterwards, Who were meet to be sent yet once againe to
  Ierusalem? he said, If thou hast any enemie or trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, send him thither, and
  thou shalt receiue him well scourged, if he escape with his life: for in that
  place, no doubt there is an especiall power of God. But a more sweet &amp;
  pleasing temple vnto God than Ierusalem, is the bodie &amp; soule of man;
  <hi>Templum Dei, &amp;c. The Temple of God is holy, which Temple yee be.</hi>
  He made a promise to Ierusalem, that no vncircumcised person should put his
  foot within it, much lesse doe any harme vnto it. How then doth God consent,
  that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils should lodge so long in man, and should trample and tread him
  vnder foot, and torment him in that extreame manner as they doe?</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> in his bookes <hi>De
  Prouidentia,</hi> doth multiplie reasons heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon: and in his second part he
  setteth downe sixe; the chiefest whereof I take to be, The feare and terrour
  which God pretendeth to put man in with the sight of one possessed with a
  Deuill. There are many men in the world, whom God <pb n="292" facs="tcp:22083:157"/> must
  bring vnto him by ill; for good will doe no good vpon them. Saint
  <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi> expounding that verse of <hi>Dauid, Descendant in infernum
  viuentes, Let them go downe aliue into the Pit</hi>; addeth, <hi>Ne descendant
  morientes, Let them not goe downe dead.</hi> Old wiues say, That wee must goe
  Saint <hi>Iames</hi> his way, either in our life or our death. But more truly
  may it be said of Hell, That to the end wee may not goe into it at our death,
  we must enter into it in our life: not like <hi>Dathan</hi> and
  <hi>Abiram,</hi> who went downe quicke into it, but with the consideration and
  ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest thinking of him that is possessed with a Deuill. For if in this life,
  when as yet the finall sentence is not giuen, the Deuill doth vse a Sinner thus
  hardly; What will he doe vnto him when God shall seale his Warrant for Hell,
  and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce condemnation againsthim? <hi>Origen</hi> noteth it, That there
  was not any kind of paine in the world, wherewith the Deuill did not torment
  <hi>Iob</hi>; afflicting him with the fires of Saint <hi>Anthonie,</hi> the
  sores of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> the Collicke, the Gout, the Canker, &amp;c.
  <hi>Effudit viscera eius. Galen</hi> saith, It is impossible that many
  In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities should meet together in one and the selfe same part of the bodie:
  But in <hi>Iob,</hi> in euerie part of his bodie the Deuill had put paine vpon
  paine, and sore vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on sore. Now if on him such rigour was shewne, who was
  appointed to bee the patterne of Patience; What cruell torments shall be
  executed on him that is to be made the example of Gods diuine justice.</p>
               <p>The second reason is, That in the infancie of the Church, it was
  fitting that there should be some chastisements that should carrie a sound and
  a noyse with them; to the end that (as <hi>Dionysius</hi> hath noted it) the
  Wicked might be terrified therewith. In the Old Testament God tooke this
  course, <hi>Vae tibi cimbalo alarum. Esay</hi> speakes this of Aegypt, hee
  termes it a Bell with wings; for the seuere and many strokes which the bell
  with wings shall beat it withall. It is an excellent Symbole of Fame, because
  as it flyes, it sends foorth a shrill sound. <hi>Appian</hi> the historian cals
  the Emperor <hi>Tiberius, The Cimball of the world,</hi> because his fame did
  ring and sound through all the nations of the Earth. After many other plagues,
  God threatned the Aegyptians with a murren or pestilence; and anon after
  ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the reason of it, <hi>That his name might be declared throughout all
  the world.</hi> And as when the great Bell tolls in Arragon, the whole Kingdome
  is strucken into feare and amasement, (for that clapper neuer wags but vpon
  some strange and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie occasion) so the whole world was strucken into
  a great feare of those rods and scourges wherewith the Aegyptians were so
  sorely beaten.<note place="margin">

  said vnto the Spies which entred into Ierico, <hi>Our hearts did faint, and
  there remained no more courage in any, because of you; For I know that the Lord

  the Princes of the Philistines could say vnto their People, Be yee not

  It remained for a Prouerbe to after Ages, <hi>The Plagues of Aegypt light vpon
  thee.</hi> To this end God permitted in the primitiue Church many demoniated
  persons; some, for forsaking the Faith; some, for abusing the Sacraments;
  others, for blasphemies, and the like: <hi>Himineus and Alexander were
  deliuered ouer vnto Sathan,</hi>

  <hi>Hier.</hi>) <hi>Nebucad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezar</hi> was by the Deuil turned into a beast:
  others, for their enuie, [<hi>Spiritus Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini mali vigebat Saul.</hi>] But
  that the Deuill should make a man deafe, blind, and dumbe, this of all other is
  the seuearest punishment: This is, <hi>To deliuer men o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>r to a reprobate sence, that they may doe those things
  which are not fitting for them. Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> saith, That God suffers this (yet
  not beeing the Author of so great an ill) by remoouing for a time his especiall
  fauour, &amp; leauing the Vnderstanding to walke <pb n="293" facs="tcp:22083:157"/> a while
  in darkenesse. The Sunne is the vniuersall cause of the light; but if a man
  will shut vp his doores and his windowes close, it is his owne fault If hee
  abide in darkenesse. God is the vniuersall cause of the spirituall light of our
  Soules; but if any one shall despise this Light, he vseth to leaue him in the
  darke. And hence was it, that these three inconueniences did befall this man,
  to wit, Deafenesse, Blindnesse, and Dumbnesse, which was one of the greatest
  rigours of his Iustice. <hi>Esay</hi> saith, <hi>I saw the Lord sitting vpon a
  high Throne</hi>;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Esay</hi> 6.</note> like a Iudge that
  sits in state, the house full of smoke, and the Seraphins of fire, publish his
  furie, and the sent of their sinnes which had gone vp into his nosthrils. Those
  two Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphins that couered Gods face, are a representation of his wrath;
  Though when the time of punishing is come, God vseth to open his eyes: but now
  the Seraphins couer his eyes, in token that he would strike this man with
  blindnesse. And therefore it is said, That the foundation of the Temple did
  shake. Then anon after followed the punishment; <hi>Excaeca cor populi huius,
  &amp; aures eius aggraua.</hi> Other Interpreters vse the Imperatiue, vttering
  this sentence in a commanding kind of voyce; <hi>Excaecetur cor populi huius,
  &amp;c. Let the heart of this people bee made blind, and their eares

  can gush out. The penitent man must first cast the Deuill out of his bosome,
  before hee can make any good Confession: First, the Preacher must cast him out
  of his heart, before hee can preach any sound Doctrine. What confession can a
  Sinner make, while the Deuill dwells in his soule? What sorrow or feeling can
  hee haue of his former faults? What purpose of amendment for the future? What
  acknowledgement of the heinousnesse of his crimes? What shame, or what feare of
  offending? Antiently men did confesse themselues only vnto God, to whom euery
  secret of the heart was so open, that mans thought and intention was
  sufficient; with the penitent, his condemning himselfe by his own mouth. Yet
  notwithstanding, <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chias</hi> said, <hi>I will recount all my yeares in

               <p>
                  <hi>The Dumbe spake.</hi> This man prostrating himselfe at our

  praising his holy Name, as oft as hee considers the great mercie which God hath
  shewed towards him. Saint <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi> saith, That although the creating

  yet the second is an act of farre greater mercie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He casteth out Deuills through Beelzebub the chiefe of the
  Deuills. Origen,</hi> Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> and Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> say,
  That the Deuills haue their studies and their cares apart: This is their first
  Tenent; Some (say they) treat of Auarice; some, of Luxurie; others, of
  Ambition; others, of Reuenge; some perturbe mens minds, occasioning great
  sorrow; others, excesse of foolish joy and mirth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, They hold, That in euerie one of these seuerall vices
  there is a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour Deuill, which hath command ouer many that are inferiour
  vnto him; And he that is the Chiefetaine of one of these Legions, is not
  obedient to any Saint whatsoeuer, except him that excells in humilitie, whose
  lowlinesse of mind may be able to incounter with his pride of heart. S.
  <hi>Marke</hi> relateth, That our Sauiour deliuering one ouer that was
  possessed of a Deuill, to his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, to the end that they should make him
  whole; howbeit they had boasted, <hi>That Deuills also were subiect vnto
  them;</hi> yet they could not doe it. Afterwards asking Iesus the cause of
  their not curing him, hee answered, <hi>Such kind of Deuills as these, are not
  cast out but with Prayer and fasting.</hi> This Deuill should seeme to be a
  Prince of some Legion, and none could doe any good vpon him, saue such Saints
  of God as were wonderfull meeke and humble, and with Fastings did beat downe
  the bodie of sinne, and by frequent and feruent prayer, prostrate their
  Soules.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Many of these deuils do possesse diuers parts of the
  body which cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respond with that vice which they are subiect to: And as the
  soldier, who sealing a wall or a fort, stickes his dagger or his Pike in some
  part of the wall where hee meanes to get vp; so the Deuill seekes to pitch his
  standard there where hee may aduance it with most ease, and most to his honour
  and glorie. <hi>Alfegor</hi> that dishonest Deuill, domineeres most in the
  Loyns, (as it is noted by Saint <hi>Gregorie</hi> in his Exposition of that
  place vpon <hi>Iob,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

  <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> who is the Prince of Pride, rules principally in the head.
  This <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> by inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, is the Prince of Flies; whither it
  were or no, that they gaue him this name in regard of those many Flies which
  his Sacrifices did breed; or whither it were because the <hi>Acharonitae</hi>
  did presume that he had freed them from certaine filthie and loathsome Flies;
  or for that the Flies are alwayes buzzing about the <pb n="295" facs="tcp:22083:158"/> head
  and face; or because the Deuill and these Flies are much alike in their euil
  disposition, [According to that of <hi>Salomon, Muscu morientes, perdunt

  Nothing bolder than a Flie</hi>: And for this cause (saith <hi>Homer</hi>) did
  the Lacedemonians beare Flies for their Deuice in their Shields; which is
  confirmed by <hi>Pierius.</hi> The Deuill occupieth the North, <hi>I will set

  the like. <hi>Plinie</hi> saith, That your Bees are forced to forsake their
  hiues, and to flie out of your Northerne parts, for the trouble that the Flies
  there giue them. The Deuill is importunate, impudent, neuer ceaseth, neuer
  growes wearie with tempting vs: And no lesse vexatiue and troublesome are your
  Flies. Saint <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie</hi> calls these our sensuall imaginations, Flies.
  <hi>Pierius</hi> reporteth, That to the importunate man they gaue the name of
  Flie; And there is no such busie bodie as the Deuill. Lastly, Your Flies doe
  abound most in the Dog dayes; and the greater is the heat of our sensualities,
  the greater store of Deuills it hatcheth. Of <hi>Marie Magdalen</hi> Saint
  <hi>Luke</hi> saith, That our Sauiour Christ cast out of her seuen Deuills.</p>
               <p>And howbeit there were other great Gods amongst the Gentiles,
  (according to <hi>Vatablus</hi> his report) as one <hi>Balberid</hi>; that is,
  <hi>Dominus Fideus,</hi> that presideth in al kind of dealing and
  contractations in Innes and Victualling houses; and was so rich an Idoll, by
  reason of the great Almes and deuotions which your Traders and dealers in the
  world did offer vnto him, that by the helpe thereof, <hi>Abimelech</hi> killing
  seuentie of his brethren, carried away the Kingdome of Israell. There was
  likewise one <hi>Belfegor,</hi> who did command in Chiefe in Gluttonie; and was
  a verie poore Idoll, in regard that they who were deuoted vnto him, spent all
  that they could rape and wring, in bellie-cheere and gourmandizing.
  Notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all these, <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> whom they likewise called the
  God of Acharon, was more famous than all the rest of that rabble. And the
  Prophets for to diuert the People from the adoration of these Idolls, did

  to this one blind man, should leaue so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others more blind than he: Which

  therein they inioyne him, not to keepe it: It is a great foolerie to thinke,
  that another will keepe that secret, which thou thy selfe couldst not conceale.
  And as great a folly is it that thou shouldst hold him vnfaithful, who
  reuealeth thy se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, and take thy selfe to be loyall, when as thou wast

  and little ouercome them. But perceiuing in this Miracle, that they perseuered
  in their malice, and that his silence gaue occasion vnto them, to increase
  their suspition, hee made a short and cutted Sermon vnto them. For, there are
  occasions wherein a man ought to bee silent, and wherein he ought to speake.
  And so those two places in the Prouerbs, which seeme quite contrarie, are well
  reconciled. <hi>Answere not a foole, according to his foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, least thou

                  <hi>Answere a foole according to his foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishnesse, least he be

  is to be a foole. And not to reply vnto him, is to giue him occasion to take
  himselfe to be wiser than he is. These two places Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi>
  quoteth in that his Tract which he made against <hi>Demerianus,</hi> Who grew
  so shamelesse and so impudent, in commending Paganisme, and condemning
  Christianitie, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a long silence, he brake out and sayd, <hi>Vltra
  tacere non oportet,</hi> I may no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger hold my peace. The like course did
  our Sauiour here take with the Scribes and Pharisees. And for the better
  conuincing of them, he made answer to their inward thoughts, which is a
  propertie onely belonging to God. Not, because they did not blaspheme him with
  their mouths; for the word, <hi>Dixerunt,</hi> proues that sufficiently; but
  because, they did either blaspheme him between their teeth, (as Saint
  <hi>Chrysostom</hi> will haue it) or because some did vtter this blasphemie 
  <pb n="298" facs="tcp:22083:160"/> with their mouth, and other some with their heart.</p>

  the least ayre pierce through them. One is ioyned to another. They sticke so
  together, that they cannot be sundred. This is a stampe of that strict vnion
  which is betwixt the Deuill and his Members. For the reprobate (according to
  Saint <hi>Gregorie</hi>) set themselues against Man. Saint <hi>Luke</hi> sayth
  of the Faithfull of the Primitiue Church, <hi>They were all of one mind, and of
  one heart</hi>: For though euery one in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular was the Sonne of his

  loue; so the Deuils, and the wicked ones, ioyne together in malice.</p>
               <p>And here by the way, we may in the Church, take one case into
  our conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, which is a great dishonour to Christianitie, and a great
  glorie vnto Hell, to wit, That the Deuills beeing such enemies amongst
  themselues, should yet confederate themselues for our hurt; And that
  Christians, tied by so many great and glorious titles to bee louing friends
  each to other, should euerie foot disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, not onely in point of their owne

  Prince with Prince, should wage war about the partition of their Kingdomes, it
  is not much; But that Prelate with Prelate, Diuine with Diuine, and Preacher
  with Preacher, should bee at difference, this is somewhat strange. <hi>Vnde

  mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, did cast foorth other Deuills. But if this were euery foote put in
  practise, and that many superiour Deuill, or their ministers, should infest and
  hinder one another; of force there must grow dissention among them, diuision
  must needs follow vpon it; and vpon this diuision, the dissolution of their
  Kingdome, as <hi>Athanasius,</hi> hath noted it. But our Sauiour Christ did
  cast out innumerable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uills, to their great griefe and torment, <hi>Crying
  and saying, Why art thou come to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vs before our time?</hi> Where Saint
  <hi>Luke</hi> sayth, <hi>In digito Dei eijcio daemonia, In the finger of God I

                  <hi>When a strong man armed, keepeth his pallace, the things

  King that lawfully possesseth a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, but is now in his hands, who by
  force, or subtiltie, vsurpeth that which is none of his own; or in his, who
  gouerns that which is his own, but with tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie and cruelty. Saint
  <hi>Austen</hi> looking narrowly into those the primarie begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of the
  Kingdomes and Empires of the World, cals them, <hi>Magna latrocinia,</hi> Great
  and famous robberies. When Rome was Queen of the World, <hi>Titus Liuius</hi>
  sayth, That all the spoiles of other nations, were there deposited.
  <hi>Alexander</hi> reprehending a Pyrat, for robbing at Sea with two poore
  ships; Hee told him, Thou robbest the whole world; and doost thou find fault
  with mee for those petty thefts that I commit? And euen thus doe things passe
  at this day, in your great commonwealths. They whip a young theefe for stealing
  but ten Royals, and let a greater scape scot-free. What thinke you (if they
  were well exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned) of a Treasurer, of a Iudge, of an Admirall, and the like
  great officers of a State, are not these great Theeues? And yet for greatnesse
  sake, we adore them. Your mice are prettie little Theeues, who in a Larder lye
  nibbling at a Pastie; Thou puttest in a Cat to kill them, or to feare them
  away; the cat falls vpon the Pye, and at times eates it all vp. Which I pray
  you is the greater Theefe of the two?</p>
               <p>The greatest Tyrant and Theefe that euer was in the World, is
  the Deuill.<note place="margin">No Theefe nor Tyrant to the Deuill.</note> Not
  onely for hauing made himselfe so much Lord and Master of the World, whereunto
  hee had no right, by stiling himselfe Prince and Lord thereof; but also for his
  exercising therein such strange and tyrannous cruelties, as hee dayly dooth.
  Our Sauiour Christ called him Theefe. <hi>He that comes not in at the right
  doore, is a Theefe and a Robber. Esay</hi> tearmes him a Tyrant. But I cannot
  let it passe without admiration, that our Sauiour should say, That hee should
  possesse all these things peaceably; being that no Theefe, nor Tyrant, can long
  inioy that which he holdeth by violence.</p>
               <p>First of all, Great is the feare which he must liue in,<note place="margin">Tyrants are euer their own torturest.</note> whether it be out of
  his owne guiltie conscience (that continuall tormenter of the Soule) or in
  regard of those perils and dangers wherin his life stands. <hi>Helyes in waite

                     </gap>legauam a viejos,</hi> That
  Tyrants neuer liued to be old men. <hi>Phalaris</hi> was one of the greatest
  that euer the World had, who sayd, That Man would neuer haue beene borne, If he
  had but knowne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand <pb n="300" facs="tcp:22083:161"/> those miseries whereunto hee
  is borne; Nor a Tyrant desire to beare rule, knew hee but the troubles and
  misfortunes, that attend commands; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, one is Feare: For, though he bee
  feared of all men, yet greater is his, than their feare. <hi>Caine</hi> was the
  first Tyrant that euer was in the World, and did liue in that terrible feare,
  that the wagging of a leafe would startle him, and make him turne coward. This
  his feare, made him to say, <hi>Whosoeuer findeth me, will slay mee.
  Macrobius,</hi> painting forth the pains &amp; torments of Hell, sayth, That
  your Tyrants haue a great rocke hanging ouer their heads, which is euermore
  threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to fall vpon them. This picture in that other life, dooth well
  answere to that which they suffer in this. <hi>Aelian</hi> compares them to
  hogs, who are no sooner toucht, but they grunt, fearing their liues shal be
  taken from them. Nor is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil himself lesse affraid than they, euer since

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, He shall bruise thy
  head.</hi> There was neuer yet that man borne into the world, that was a Saint,
  or whom the prophecies did prefigure for a Saint, but that the Deuill was still
  affraid that hee would cracke his skull, or (to vse the Scripture phrase) would
  bruise his head.</p>
               <p>Secondly, For the better auoiding of feare, a Tyrant out of
  feare commits many cruelties. <hi>Herod</hi> out of this feare, slew so many
  innocent Babes. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> out of this feare, would haue all the male
  children of the Hebrews put to death. <hi>Athalia,</hi> out of this feare,
  destroyed all the stocke Royal that she could come by. For all (sayth
  <hi>Seneca</hi>) that are either powerfull, or popular, or next of bloud to the
  Crowne, whether they be friends or enemies, are alike suspected of him that is
  a Tyrant. And <hi>Iob</hi> remembers the reason of this iealousie, <hi>Hee
  takes away the liues of the valiant because he is affraid they will cut his
  throat.</hi> There was neuer yet any Saint of God, to whome the Deuill, out of
  this feare, was not cruell. He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed <hi>Caine</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> against
  <hi>Abell; Ismael,</hi> against <hi>Isaac; Esau</hi> against <hi>Iacob</hi>;
  and his owne naturall Brethren, against <hi>Ioseph.</hi> But when our Sauiour
  Christ came into the World, what a roaring, and what a hidious bellowing did
  the Deuill make? And as the Hieronshaw (when the fawlkoner lets his hawke flye
  from fist, which must get vp aboue him and take away his life) fals a
  shrieking, and makes a most pittifull and fearefull noyse; so the Deuill made
  most lamentable mone when our Sauiour Christ appeared to the World, Crying out,
  <hi>Why art thou come to trouble vs before the time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Deuill then, suffring so many affrights and feares, and
  multiplying so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny cruelties as he dayly doth; what peace or quietnesse can
  hee inioy, that our Sauiour should say of him, <hi>In pace sunt omnia, quae
  possidet? All that he possessech is in peace.</hi> Three reasons may be rendred
  for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Reasons by which the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill assures himselfe
 of peaceably pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessing his spoiles.</note>The one, in regard of his pride;
  who was so presumptuous as to say, <hi>I will as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend &amp;c.</hi> He that did
  hope to inioy a seat in Heauen; it is not much that hee should looke to inioy
  peace on earth. For though feare disquiet him, yet pride assureth him,
  flattering himselfe, that hee shall ascend the throne of the Highest without
  any disturbance.</p>
               <p>The other, in regard of the miserie of those whom he tyrannizeth
  ouer. Redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing them to that feare, that they dare notonce quack, or offer to
  stir against him, to such a wretched an estate hath he brought them. And
  therefore it is no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile that he should make no doubt of keeping sure
  possession of this dumbe, deafe, and blind man.</p>
               <p>The third, in regard that man hath made a base ad dishonourable
  peace with the Deuill, yeelding himselfe to be his slaue, and by resting well
  contented with this his seruitude. <hi>Plutarch</hi> reporteth of <hi>Appius
  Claudius,</hi> that Rome being about <pb n="301" facs="tcp:22083:161"/> to make peace with
  King <hi>Pirrhus,</hi> causing himselfe to be led to the Senat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for that
  he was blind. He no sooner came into the Senat-house, but he said vnto them, My
  Lords, and yee the rest of the noble Senators of Rome, I am informed, that you
  are concluding a peace with <hi>Pirrhus,</hi> that antient enemy of your bloud,
  and this renowmed commonwealth: I should take it for a great fauour from the
  Gods, that as I am blind, so I were deafe likewise, that my eares might not
  heare so great an infamie and reproach to Rome. The Moores take a cowardly
  Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard captiue, they carry him to Te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>uan, from thence to Manuecos, from thence to some poore Farme,
  vsing him more like a dogge than a man, he makes peace with his Master, and
  turnes Moore: Iust so doth it succeed betwixt Man and the Deuill; He leads him
  from one sinne into another, from a lesser to a greater mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie; His vsage is
  such, that he makes his peace with him, and in the end turnes Deuill. This is
  the Sheepes making peace with the Wolfe, the Chickins with the Kyte, the Mouse
  with the Cat, and the Hare with the Grey-hound, &amp;c. Not to complaine of
  this so great a misery, is to bee dumbe, and blind. <hi>Os ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent, &amp;c. A

  should say, if I shall free this man out of the Deuils clutches, the Deuill
  will not helpe me in it. For this is one of the greatest iniuries and distasts,
  which the Deuill can receiue, in regard of that great competition which the
  Deuill hath therein with God. And one of the greatest wrongs that God can
  receiue, is, That the Deuill should winne a Soule from his seruice, which he
  hath purchased at so great a price as his most pretious blood. And one of the
  things that the deuil takes most offence at, is, that God should cast him out

  And oftentimes they haue the worst of it: for if the other two make peace, they

  Gods Spirit. In which opinion agreeth S. <hi>Hierome,</hi> S.
  <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome,</hi> S. <hi>Ambrose, Gregorie Nazianzen,</hi> and
  <hi>Athanasius.</hi> And if any man shall aske me, What is then to be
  vnderstood by the Spirit of God? S. <hi>Gregorie,</hi> S. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> and
  S. <hi>Austen</hi> answer, The Holy-Ghost. And rendring the reason thereof,
  they say, That the repartition of gifts is by the fingers, &amp; the Holy-Ghost
  is that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in the Trinity, which doth distribute these gifts both to men
  and Angels. <hi>Athanasius</hi> and S. <hi>Hierome</hi> giue another reason;
  The Son, in the Scripture is called the Arme of God, as also the Hand of God;
  and as the arme and the hand pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the bodie, and the finger from both,
  so the Sonne of God proceedeth from the Father, and the Holy-Ghost from them
  both.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Euthimius</hi> saith, That the finger of God and the spirit
  of God signifie Gods power. The Magi of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> not beeing able to
  make those Gnats which troubled the Aegyptians, or (as <hi>Rabbi Salomon</hi>
  and some latter Writers will haue it) those Lice which were sent to plague
  them; said, <hi>Digitus Dei est hic, This is the finger of God</hi>; that is,
  the vertue and power of God: whereby his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer is pointed at as it were with
  the finger. Of this opinion is <hi>Tertullian</hi>: and further addeth, That
  God calls his finger, his power; for that the least part in God, which is his
  finger, expresseth Gods omnipotencie. And that hee might not wrong this his
  greatnesse, in this action of his, of casting Deuills out of mens bodies, he
  vseth this phrase, <hi>If I by the finger of God, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">The casting out of Deuills not alwaies a
 signe of the comming of Gods King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. <hi>Acts</hi> 19.14.</note>Saint
  <hi>Chrysostome</hi> doubts of this consequence; <hi>Si in digito Dei eijcio
  Daemonia, perueniet in vos regnum Dei, If I cast out Deuils by the finger of
  God, the Kingdome of God shall come vnto you.</hi> Before that God did
  incarnate his Sonne, there were some Exorcists amongst the Iewes, which in Gods
  name, and by his vertue and power did cast out Deuils. And in the 19 of the
  <hi>Acts</hi> it is said, That there were certaine sons of <hi>Scena</hi> a Iew
  (the Priest) which did this. And <hi>Iosephus</hi> makes men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of one
  <hi>Eleazar,</hi> who before <hi>Vespasian</hi> and his whole Army did cast out
  many Deuils. And of <hi>Salomon</hi> it is said, That he left some exorcismes
  behind him, in which the name of God was called vpon, when as yet the Kingdome
  of God was not come. By which S. <hi>Ierome</hi> vnderstands the comming of our
  Sauiour Christ, in his Exposition of that place of S. <hi>Luke, Regnum Dei
  intra vos est.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto I answer, That one of the tokens of the time of
  our Sauior Christ, was, his casting out of Deuils; as well as those other, That
  the Blind should see, the Deafe heare, the Dead arise, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But because this Prophecie is not so fully expressed in the
  Scripture as the rest are, it is sufficient, that our Sauiour Christ wrought
  this miracle amongst the rest, in confirmation that he was that promised Christ
  and Messias, as also that he was the Sonne of God. Whence it followeth, <hi>The
  Kingdome of God is come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you.</hi>

                  <hi>When a strong man armed keepeth his Pallace.</hi> Saint
  <hi>Mathew</hi> and Saint <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <pb n="303" facs="tcp:22083:162"/> make this sentence somewhat cleerer. <hi>How shall any
  one enter into the house of the strong man, vnlesse he first bind the strong
  man?</hi> And presently Saint <hi>Luke</hi> giues the reason of it, <hi>When a
  strong man armed keepeth his Pallace, &amp;c.</hi> Our Sauiour Christ compares
  this strong man to <hi>Beelzebub.</hi> And so S. <hi>Chaysostome</hi> and S.
  <hi>Augustine</hi> stile him.</p>
               <p>First, because his power is absolutely great; as we say, a great
  Mountaine, or a strong Tower. <hi>Iob</hi> indeeres this his power in diuers
  and sundrie places.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In regard of our weakenesse the Deuill is said to be
  strong, as wel in his offensiue, as his defensiue armes.</p>
               <p>Humane goods, whereon men commonly place their hearts, Saint
  <hi>Ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>il</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares them to an
  highway Robber, who hides himselfe in some bush or thicket, that before the
  Traueller be aware of him, he may the better set vpon him. So the Deuill comes
  masked and disguised with an apparance of earthly blessings, and baiting our
  tastes therewith, he playes vpon vs. And therefore it is sayd in
  <hi>Wisedome,</hi> That God created these goods for a snare to catch
  fooles.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Wisd.</hi> 14.</note> If the Deuil should tempt
  vs, and go plainly to worke with vs, discouering his foulenesse vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, Who
  would looke after him, or haue any thing to doe with him? But because those
  euills which worke vpon the Soule are not seene, and those of the bodie do much
  afright vs; we stand more in feare of the Deuil, than of sinning, suffering our
  selues basely to bee subdued by our owne proper affections. Saint
  <hi>Bernard</hi> saith, That three enemies do continually assault vs, but that
  none of them without our consent can doe vs any harme. So that the greatest
  enemie which each man hath, is himselfe; and for to worke his owne ruine, hee
  need no other helpe but himselfe. All hells power were too weake, if thou didst
  not put the weapons of thy consent into his hands; thou thy selfe giuest him
  the cords wherewith to binde thee, and the sword wherewith to cut thyne owne
  throat. <hi>His own iniquities shal take the Wicked, &amp; he shal be holden
  with the cords of his own sin.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Armed with these weapons,<note place="margin">Why Sathan is stiled
 the Prince of the world.</note> he becomes Master of the house of our soule (as
  it seemeth to Saint <hi>Hierome,</hi>) or of the world (as <hi>Irenaeus</hi>
  expounds it.) And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> calls him the Prince of the
  world. So that it was necessarie that our Sauior Christ should come, &amp;
  should manacle him, &amp; take these his weapons from him, wherein he so much
  trusted.</p>
               <p>And that we way the better vnderstand how this imprisonment
  past; First of all, it is to be noted, That God neuer consents to the Deuills
  tempting of a good man, beyond his power of resistance and subduing of him.
  <hi>God is faithfull,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.</note>
                  <hi>which will not suffer yee to be tempted aboue that yee be able</hi>; for if
  hee should haue libertie without limitation, there should not be that holy man
  whom (like <hi>Iob</hi>) he would not bring to the dunghill.</p>
               <p>Secondly, By our Sauior Christs comming into the world, the
  power of this tyrant was much lessened; not that his prison is lesse strict and
  hard than before, but because God communicating his grace to the Faithfull,
  makes them more strong and valiant in their resistance.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Since his tempting of our Sauior, his hands are bound,
  &amp; his force &amp; power hath failed him (as <hi>Hilarie</hi> &amp;
  <hi>Irenaeus</hi> hath obserued) for when he saw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self so shamefully
  ouercome, he turned coward, &amp; grew so feareful, as wel by the vertue of his
  diuinitie, as the force of his command, <hi>Vade retro Satana</hi>; that he
  ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer after durst attempt to tempt our Sauior Christ in any visible forme, nor
  doe either him or those that follow him, that hurt which hee willingly would.
  And as in the Garden, saying but onely <hi>Ego sum, I am
  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ee,</hi> hee made the Roman
  soldiers so afraid, that they flew back &amp; fel to the ground; so by saying
  <hi>Vade retro <pb n="304" facs="tcp:22083:163"/> Satana, Goe behind me Sathan,</hi> hee
  made the Deuills so affraid and put such cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise into them, that trembling
  and crying out, they made hast to forsake those bodies they possessed. Saint
  <hi>Ierome</hi> saith, That our Sauiour Christ speaketh here of this
  imprisonment, <hi>How can any one enter into the strong mans, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, By our Sauiour Christs death, did the Deuill seeke to
  shake off this his feare and cowardise, by mustring vp all the rest of his
  forces; God so permitting it, that the Victorie might bee the more glorious and
  the more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous. This is that which our Sauiour Christ sayd vnto the
  Pharisees, as mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of Hell, <hi>This is your very houre, and the power of
  darkenesse.</hi> But after this hee remained in straighter imprisonment than
  before,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke.</hi> 22.53.</note> As you may read in the
  Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calips. <hi>I saw an Angell come downe from Heauen, hauing the key of the
  bottomelesse-pit and a great chaine in his hand;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Apoc.</hi> 20.</note> 
                  <hi>And hee tooke the Dragon, that old
  Serpent, which is the Deuill and Satan, and he bound him a thousand yeares. And
  cast him into the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomelesse-pit, and sealed the doore vpon him, that he
  should deceiue the people no more, til the thousand yeares were fulfilled, for
  after that he must be loosed for a little season.</hi> By these thousand
  yeares, the Saints doe vnderstand that space or terme of time which is to be
  before the comming of Antechrist; and those effects, which did succeed after
  the death of our Sauiour Christ, prooue, that till then his impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment was
  to be more straight, and that the Angell did not onely tye a chaine to his
  feete, but also put a barnacle about his rongue, and a ring in his nosthrils,
  that not onely the strongest men should escape his snares, but those that were
  lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle children, and tender infants.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>When the vncleane

  or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming foorth. <hi>Exibant ab eo daemonia, clamantia per loca in aquosa,
  The Deuils went out crying in watrie places.</hi> S. <hi>Mathew</hi> vseth the
  word, <hi>Arida, Drie places.</hi> The Greeke word, signifies both these.
  <hi>Origen</hi> by these places, vnderstandeth Hell. But since those Deuills,
  which entred into the swine of Gennezaret, did desire of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Christ,
  that he would giue them that mansion, it is not to be beleeued, that when they
  goe out of mens bodies they would for their pleasure make choyce of the
  bottomlesse pit;<note place="margin">The Deuill finds no rest but where he may
 doe mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe.</note> Saint <hi>Ierome</hi> declares the same in the word,
  <hi>Solitudines.</hi> And your Exorcists doe coniure them, to get them to the
  mountaines and the woods; pretending to excuse the hurt which they do,
  remaining among the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course or presse of people. The Angell which
  accompanied yong <hi>Tobias,</hi> impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned the Deuil called
  <hi>Asmodeus,</hi> who had killed <hi>Saras</hi> seuen husbands, in the
  de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarts of Aegypt. And further sayth, That the deuill could not there find any
  rest; because he should not there meet with any people to deceiue them. Not
  that the deuill can haue any rest; but in doing mischiefe hee feeles the lesse
  torment. Cheering himself (like the enuious man) with other mens miseries. I
  will returne (sayth hee) vnto mine house whence I came out. Not that he can
  freely returne thither when he listeth, but because he striues and indeuours to
  doe it: And for that his experience teacheth him, that he there suffers least
  paine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He taketh to him seuen other spirits, worse than
  himselfe.</hi> He lights vpon a house, whence all Vertue is banished; Well
  fitted for such a guest, and seuen more such companions as himselfe.</p>
               <p>There are three sorts of persons possessed with Deuills.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Three sorts of persons pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed with
 Deuills.</note>One sort of them, are spiritually possessed, by reason of their
  mortal &amp; dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sinnes; For he that commiteth sinne, makes himselfe the
  seruant of sinne, and willingly puts himselfe into the power of the deuill.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="305" facs="tcp:22083:163"/>Others are corporally possessed, as the
  Energumeni, and such as are Lunatick· And Saint <hi>Austen</hi>
  reporteth, that many young children beeing baptized, suffer this torment. And
  <hi>Cassianus</hi> sayth, That many Saints of God haue suffered the like, God
  so permitting it, that they might bee refined and purified, as gold in the
  crisole.</p>
               <p>The third, consisteth of both those kinds.</p>
               <p>Now, which of these three doe you take to be the worst? Saint
  <hi>Crysostome,</hi> and <hi>Gregorie Nazianzen</hi> doe affirme, That the
  partie that is spiritually possessed, is in the worst and most dangerous
  estate: And the reasons are as strong, as they are cleare. Which indeed are
  most cleere.</p>
               <p>The first is, That the deuill can doe vs little harme, vnlesse
  we fall into sinne. For without the helpe of sin the deuill cannot destroy both
  soule &amp; bodie. For though the deuill doe put it into the fire, it is our
  owne heart that must forge the worke. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> doth defie all the
  creatures both of Heauen, Earth, and Hell. And why? <hi>For I am persuaded</hi>
  (saith he) <hi>that neither Death, nor Life, nor Angells,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.38.</note> 
                  <hi>nor Principalities, nor Powers, nor
  things Present, nor things to Come, nor Heigth, nor Depth, nor any other
  creature, shall be able to seperate vs from the Loue of God, which is in Iesus
  Christ,</hi> yet he durst not defie sinne. For that alone is more powerfull to
  doe vs hurt than all other creatures put together.<note place="margin">No
 creature so hurtfull to man as sinne.</note> Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> askes
  the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, Why the deuill persuaded <hi>Iosephs</hi> brethren to put him
  first into a pit, and then afterwards to sell him? And he answeres, that it was
  the enuie and hatred which they bare vnto him for his dreames sake. And that
  other weapons, the deuill needed none. And in that Parable of the Tares, where
  the deuill sow'd his Tares amongst the Wheat,<note place="margin">A lesser ill to
 be possessed in bodie than in soule.</note> it is said, That although he had
  not sowne them, yet the good seed would haue beene lost through the
  carelesnesse &amp; negligence of the husbandmen, For negligence in things so
  necessarie is a greater deuil, than that of Hell. In this sence Saint
  <hi>Gregorie Nazianzen</hi> sayd of <hi>Arrius, Satius illi esset a daemonio
  vexari, It had bin better for him to haue beene tormented by a Deuill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second is, For that the goods of the bodie, are not
  comparable to those of the soule, <hi>Tange cuncta quae possidet, Touch all
  that he hath,</hi> Sayd the Deuill to God, when he talked with him concerning
  <hi>Iob.</hi> In a word touching the goods of the soule, the least thereof is
  of more worth than all the world. And the goods not beeing able to bee compared
  one with another, neither can their ill. Nay, rather to loose these goods of
  the bodie, turnes oftentimes to our greater gaine. <hi>Perieramus, nisi
  perijssemus, We had perished, if we had not perished,</hi> It was the saying of
  a Philosopher in a storme, when the throwing of his goods ouerboord, was the
  sauing of his life. But that Soule that shall cast his sinnes ouerboord, and
  drowne them in the bottome of the Sea, that they may neuer be able to rise vp
  in iudgement against him; is a happinesse beyond all happinesse, and not to bee
  exchanged for the whole Empire of the World. <hi>What booteth it a man, to
  gaine all the world, and to loose his owne soule?</hi> Therefore it is a lesse
  ill, to be posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in Bodie than in Soule. For sinne onely is that true
  euill, which depriueth vs of true good.</p>
               <p>Likewise, He that is spiritually possessed, is in worse case
  than he that hath a deuill in soule and body: And of this truth there are two
  euident reasons.</p>
               <p>The one, that to haue a Deuill in the bodie, is no small
  occasion whereby the Soule is saued. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> said of the incestuous
  person, <hi>Let him be deliuered vnto Sathan, for the destruction of the
  Flesh,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.5. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi>

                     </gap>.20.</note> 
                  <hi>that the Spirit
  may be saued in the day of the Lord Iesus.</hi> Whither it were by way of
  excommunication, (as it seemeth good vnto <hi>Thomas</hi>) the Deuills
  tormenting him, following his excommunication, (as <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ietan</hi> 
                  <pb n="306" facs="tcp:22083:164"/> will haue it) or whither he did deliuer him ouer to the
  Deuill, as to Gods Executioner, without excommunicating him, (as Saint
  <hi>Hierome</hi> is of opinion) or whither the Apostles had licence to doe all
  or any of these at their pleasure; sure I am, that Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi>
  saith, That the deliuering ouer of these Sinners vnto the Deuill, was a putting
  of them into some paine or griefe of body by the hands of the Deuill, as he
  tormented <hi>Iob,</hi> to the end that they might be drawne to repentance for
  their sinnes. And this agrees with that of Saint <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> That
  Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did deliuer the incestuous man ouer to the Deuill,
  <hi>tanquam pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dagogo aperiens ei poenitentiae ianuam, As to a Schoolemaster,
  opening to him the doore of Repentance.</hi> Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> saith,
  <hi>Tanquam Quaestionario, as to an Informer or Baylife</hi>: But they differ
  in this, That when the Informers accuse, &amp; the Baylifes attach, it is
  commonly for others good; but when the Deuill accuseth or layes hold of a man,
  it is for hurt. Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith, That when the Deuill had got
  leaue to tempt <hi>Iob,</hi> hee got it for to worke his destruction. <hi>Wilt
  thou take the Deuill with a hooke like a Fish, or with a string like a
  Bird?</hi> Yes, thou shalt lay that poyson for him as a bait, wherewith he
  thought to destroy thee. Wherein is to be seene the wisedome and omnipotencie
  of God, in that hee turnes these trickes and subtilties of the Deuill against
  Man, to Mans benefit; who being wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to swallow him vp at a bit, choakes
  himselfe, and doth rather benefit than hurt him. Wherein is plainely to be
  seene, the good hap which this dumbe man had in suffering in his bodie; for if
  his hurt had layne onely in his soule, they would neuer haue brought him to our
  Sauiour Christ, and it might haue so fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len out, that he might haue remained
  for euer in this his miserie: so that the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his bodie, was the
  occasion whereby he remained sound both in bodie and in soule; as commonly
  those did whom our Sauiour cured.</p>
               <p>The second reason is, That there is no Christian can bee
  supposed to bee so wicked, that it being put to his choice to chuse one of
  these two, either to be dumbe, deafe, and blind, or to be one of those
  blasphemous Iewes, who said, <hi>In Beelzebub eijcit Daemonia, In Beelzebub he
  casteth out Deuills</hi>? would not rather make choyce of this mans misfortune,
  than of the Iewes hardnesse of heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He brings seuen Diuils worse than himselfe.</hi> When this
  foule Fiend enters into a man, he makes way for a great many more of his
  fellowes. For the Deuil be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rather the Soules Bawd, than it's Bridegroome,
  he beares no loue thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; but God, because she is his true Spouse, is
  tender of her, and will not suffer the least wind of sinne to blow vpon her,
  but will looke louingly and carefully vnto her. But of this we haue treated
  heretofore.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And it came to passe while he spake, a certaine woman amidst
  the multitude, lifting vp her voyce, &amp;c.</hi> Our Sauiour Christs Sermon
  did not make the least gap in the hard hearts of the Scribes and Pharisees, but
  it wrought such great admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the brest of a certaine woman called
  <hi>Marcella,</hi> that lifting vp her voyce amidst the Doctours, and praising
  our Sauiour Christ, she cried out aloud, <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed is the wombe that bare
  thee, and the paps that gaue thee sucke.</hi> These Pharisees condemns thee for
  one that hath made a couenant with <hi>Beelzebub</hi>; but I say, that from the
  verie instant of thy conception thou wast a holy man, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
  blessed was the wombe that bare thee, &amp;c. and that the leaprosie of
  origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall sinne did not worke vpon thee, as it did vpon all the rest of
  Mankind. And that those paps which thou suckedst being likewise blessed, they
  could not giue milke to a Sinner. And because thy conception and thy birth were
  both holy, Gods blessing bee with that mother which conceiued and brought forth
  such a sonne. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, That it was not onely
  <hi>Marcella</hi> that vttered <pb n="307" facs="tcp:22083:164"/> these praises of our
  Sauiour, but that many others also beeing taken with the strangenesse of this
  miracle, fell into an extraordinarie commendation of him. But if the Gospell
  make mention of one only, it may be vnderstood, that <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cella</hi> was the
  first that sung in that tune, and that many others followed on, and bore a part
  therein. And this sutes well with that of Saint <hi>Luke, They glorified him,
  saying, A great Prophet is risen vp amongst vs</hi>: One while confessing him
  to be God, another while, the <hi>Messias.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of this applause and commendation of our Sauiour, wee haue two
  forcible reasons,</p>
               <p>The one, That generall good which Christ did here vpon earth,
  and more particularly that which he did to this poore miserable man: For, to
  doe good, but especially to the Poore, is a powerful motiue of praise.
  <hi>Confitebor Domino ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misin ore meo, in medio multoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> laudabo eum, qui
  astitit a dextris pauperis, I wil acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge God with a loud voice; in the
  middest of many will I praise him who stood at the right hand of the
  Poore:</hi> This doth that phrase (as Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> hath noted it)
  inferre, of <hi>Nimis in ore meo</hi>: not betweene the teeth, nor in some
  by-corner, but <hi>in medio Multorum, in the middest of the Congregation.</hi>
  And therefore saith <hi>Eccles. Splendidum in panibus benedicent labia
  multorum:</hi> He that succoureth the poore, he that slaketh hunger, all the
  World shall ring of his praise, and thousands of bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings shall be throwne
  vpon him. All Nations of the earth did euermore cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate and honour those
  that were publike benefactors to the Commonwealth; and the Citisens thereof, by
  erecting Statues vnto them, that there might remain an eternall memorie and
  immortall fame of their noble actions: As <hi>Pliny</hi> repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth of Athens;
  <hi>Plutarch,</hi> of Lacedemonia; and many Historiographers, of Rome.
  <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth did bring downe the price of salt; for the which Rome
  thought themselues so much bound vnto him, that they did set vp his Statue in
  the Capitoll, with a motto that spake thus, <hi>Optimi liberalissimique
  Pontificis memoriae.</hi> But your Kings and Princes now a dayes, doe make such
  a common practise of pilling and polling the Commonwealth, that to see any good
  come from them, may be held as great a miracle as that we haue now in hand.

  tyrannie and oppression. <hi>Arise, ô thou daughter of Syon, and fall a
  threshing. For in this mountaine shall the hand of the Lord rest, and Moab
  shall be threshed vnder him, euen as straw is threshed in Madmenah.</hi> The
  proportion of the comparison holds in this, That as your heifers do tread the
  corne vnderneath their feet, till it be troad all out of the eare; so your
  Princes trample vpon their Subiects, till they haue drawne from them the
  greater part of their goods: and if here and there an eare escape him, and goe
  away whole, hee may crie, Goda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercie good lucke; <hi>Princeps postulat, &amp;
  Iudex in reddendo est.</hi> The Prince, hee will haue some strange taxe or new
  imposition layd vpon the Subiect; your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerend Iudges they will inuent a way
  to do it, and say, There is good law for it; and euer after it shall be a
  President, or a ruled Case. And whence doth this arise? Marry from this, That
  the one is a thorne in the Subiects sides, and the other are brambles. And for
  this cause, in that Fable of the Trees, none did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to be King, saue the
  Bramble. And this is the reason why Princes are soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed vp by their
  Flatterers, and Cushion-sowing Courtiers vnder Kings elbows; but these
  Earewigs, howsoeuer their Prince may affect them, I am sure they are neither
  esteemed nor applauded by the People. And if these Flatterers grow fat and
  full, the Commons haue poore commons, and are poore and hungerstarued. But
  because this King of Heauen did good vnto his People, hee was praised and 
  <pb n="308" facs="tcp:22083:165"/> commended by them. So saith Saint <hi>Mathew, The
  Multitudes wondred; and seeing the Dumbe to speake, the Blind to see, the Lame
  to walke, they magnified the God of Israell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The other, The force of our Sauiour Christs words.
  <hi>Ecclesiasticus</hi> saith, That the words of a wise man are like so many

  haue that force, what efficacie shall Gods words carrie with them?</p>

  vnder his humanitie, insomuch that the Deuills eyes, beeing so sharpe sighted,
  and able to discerne things afarre off, could not know him, when his Diuinitie
  was hidden vnder those paines and torments which hee endured. <hi>Esay</hi>
  saith, <hi>Quasi absconditus vultus eius,</hi> It was hidden from the Worlds

  presse mee with that place of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> That hee was manifested and
  made knowne to the World; I answer, That he did hide himselfe, but the Father
  did manifest him in the Cratch; hee hid himselfe in the manger, but his
  swathing cloathes driueled on by the Oxe and the Asse, and the reares that
  trickled downe his cheekes, did discouer him to be Man; the Kings sought to
  conceale him, but the Sheepheards did reueale him in the Temple; his mother,
  bearing him as a Sinner in her bellie, who was to redeeme the World, did hide
  and couer him, but <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Anna</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetesse did
  proclaime him to the world; his kneeling downe in Iordan before he was
  baptised, did hide his worth; but the opening of Heauen, and the voyce of the
  Father did declare him to be his Sonne; and the Holy-Ghost descending downe
  vpon his head in the forme of a Doue, did manifest his Maiestie. Vpon the
  Crosse, the Nayles, the Gall, the Vinegar, his wounds, his stripes, his shame,
  and his being forsaken of his Father, did hide his glorie; but the Centurion,
  the Theefe, his Executioners, the Sunne, Moone, Stones, and Sepulchres rendring
  vp their Dead, did manifest his power. And here the Scribes and Pharisees

  <hi>Flauit Spiritus eius, &amp;c.</hi> These were strange things, but much more
  strange was it, That a poore sillie old woman should with two or three words
  confute the wisedome of Ierusalem, and put them to such a nonplus that they had
  not a <pb n="309" facs="tcp:22083:165"/> word to say.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Blessed is the wombe that bare thee.</hi> Shee reckons it
  heere as a great blessing to the Virgin <hi>Marie,</hi> that she was the mother
  of such a Son; which is an epitome of all her praises and excellencies. The
  Euangelist say no more, because all that may be said of her, is contained in
  this one word, Mother. And because some blasphemous persons had taken this name
  from her, in the generall Ephesine Councell, celebrated in the time of Pope
  <hi>Celestine</hi> and <hi>Theodosius</hi> the Emperor, whereat were present
  two hundered Bishops; it was concluded, That the most blessed Virgin should be
  called <hi>Theotocos,</hi> that is, The mother of God; for that our Sauiour was
  both Gods Sonne and hers, hauing his filiation from them both. The same was
  likewise defined in the Calcedonian Councell, vnder <hi>Leo</hi> the twelfth.
  So that the same Holy-Ghost which assisted these Councells, had prompted also
  this womans tongue. Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> saith, That this great name
  <hi>Theotocos</hi> is the greatest this diuine ladie hath, or can haue. And
  because the name of Mother of God, may seem to detract somthing from the sole
  omnipotencie of God, from his goodnesse, from his wisedome, &amp; all other his
  excellent and singular attributes; left men might sinne in ouerpraising her,
  &amp; giuing too much vnto her in that kind, <hi>Epiphanius</hi> saith, It was
  fit that Heauen should put a taske and a tye vpon this our tongue, least it
  should lash out too farre. And therefore her Sonne when he was vpon the Crosse,
  and tooke his last farewell of his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he said vnto her, <hi>Woman, behold
  thy sonne,</hi> giuing her that name, rather than of Mother, least some
  superstitious people might attribute the Diuine nature vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her, and so rob
  God of his honour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the brests which thou hast suckt.</hi> She praiseth her
  wombe and her brests.<note place="margin">Christs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception in the heart, is

  correspondencie; a womans concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in her wombe, and the manifestation
  thereof in her brests. Iust so doth it succeed with the Soule, in it's
  conception of God, and the brest of the iust man, who thereupon doth manifest
  the guest that lodgeth there. Betweene the Vine and the Wine there is that good
  correspondencie, that the floures of the Grape participating of it's
  sweetnesse, sends forth a most pleasant odour. So likewise when the floures of
  Christ beginne to bud in the Soule, the brest of Man doth streightway thereupon
  breath forth a most sweet and redolent odour.</p>

               <p>This was Mans first Heauen; the first place wherein God bestowed
  this his greatest happinesse and blessing vpon Man. It is a happinesse to Man,
  when his Vnderstanding sees God, and when his Will loues him, taking pleasure
  therein as in his chiefest good. Now, the first eyes that saw God, and the
  first will that loued God, and placed his ioy &amp; delight therein, was that
  of our Sauior Christ; and <hi>Maries</hi> wombe being the receptacle of this

  our will be good. But this most blessed Virgin had fitted and prepared so rich
  a temple for him in her womb, that God himself came down to dwel there. Some
  seeme to doubt, or rather wonder, why God should so long deferre his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
  in the flesh. He stayd so long, that the Holy-Ghost might prepare and 
  <pb n="310" facs="tcp:22083:166"/> dresse vp this Temple of the Virgins Wombe, <hi>Vt
  dignum filij tui habitaculum of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fici mereretur, spiritu sancto cooperante,

                  <hi>Blessed is the Wombe.</hi> This commending of the Sonne, was

  much vpon their parents worth. And therefore they doe so vsually blazon forth
  the noble acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their Ancestors. And by how much the more antient they
  are, the more glorious is their coat of Armes. True it is, that fathers doe

  Citisens, their fathers were innobled thereby. And <hi>Ioseph,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
  incurred the hatred and displeasure of his brethren, because he dreamt that the
  Sunne, the Moone, and the twelue starres did adore him, the sacred Text sayth,
  That the father, <hi>Rem tacitus considerabat,</hi> did lay it vp in his heart;
  as one that did imagine, that from the prosperitie of the sonne, there might
  some ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour redound to the father. <hi>Cornelius Tacitus</hi> relateth in his

  backe whence they came, they can make it scarce reach so farre, as their great
  Grandfathers. But the glorie of our Sauiour Iesus Christ, our Redeemer, did
  reach as farre as vnto King <hi>Dauid,</hi> and could draw his Pedegree from
  the Patriarch <hi>Abraham.</hi> Whome, that hee might honour them the more, he
  stiles himselfe in the Gospell to be their sonne, <hi>Filij Dauid, filij
  Abraham:</hi> where it is to be noted, that after so many ages, so many changes
  and alterations both of the times and the people, of Kings, Iudges, and
  Captaines, in the end, there being an interuention of two and fortie
  generations, the glorie of Christ attained to the hundred Grandfather. And by
  calling him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe the sonne of <hi>Dauid</hi> and of <hi>Abraham,</hi> hee
  reuiued their remembrance, and made them thereby more famous. And if in so
  large a distance of time, it wrought so noble an effect, treading so neer vpon
  the tract of these latter times, that there was no wall now betweene the Mother
  and the Sonne, her blessed Wombe, and his most happie Birth; what a glorie must
  it be vnto her, &amp; what a happines vnto vs? <hi>Emisenus</hi> treating in a
  Sermon of his, touching the assump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Lady, and with what honour shee

  had gained both in Heauen and in Earth, returned backe againe that day,
  imploying their best &amp; speediest course in the honoring of his Mother.
  Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> stiles her the forme of God; Either because shee was the
  forme or mold through which God did thus transforme himselfe, by taking our
  humane shape vpon him; or else, because the graces of God, though not in so
  great a measure, were translated or transferred ouer vnto her. A mould made of

  that correcting, as it were, what <hi>Marcella</hi> sayd, he doth mend and
  better her speech. Doost thou (saith hee) terme my mother blessed? Thou art
  deceiued; for shee is not blessed for that shee bare mee, but because she heard
  my word. And this sence is taken out of two places of Saint
  <hi>Augustine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The one, in his tenth tract vpon Saint <hi>Iohn</hi>; where he
  saith, <hi>Mater quam appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las foelicem, non inde foelix, quia in ea verbum
  caro factum est, sed quia Verba Dei custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit</hi>; That mother of myne whom
  thou callest blessed, was not therefore bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, because in her, the Word was
  made Flesh, but because she layd vp the word of God in her heart.</p>
               <p>The other, in his thirtie eight Epistle, which he writes to a
  Gentleman called <hi>Letus</hi>; who being newly conuerted, was shrewdly layd
  at by his mother (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suading him all that she possibly could, that he should
  not proceed in this his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination:) And proouing vnto him, That in this
  cause he ought to denie and hate that mother that had brought him forth
  according to the flesh, and to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Church, by which he was regenerated
  &amp; borne anew according to the Spirit. Amongst many other weightie reasons
  to mooue him thereunto, hee vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth this amongst the rest; Thy King and thy
  Emperour Christ (saith he) had a mother, and such a mother as neuer man had the
  like: and being one day busie in preaching, (which was Heauens businesse) they
  told him, That his mother and his brethren were without at the doore, expecting
  that he should come forth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. But he stretching out his hand to his
  Disciples, said, <hi>Quae mater? Et qui fratres mei? Who is my mother, and who
  my bretheren?</hi> My mother and my brethren are they who doe the will of my
  Father; as for any other Kindred or bloud I acknowledge none. Summing vp (saith
  Saint <hi>Augustine</hi>) in this num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, <hi>etiam ipsam Virginem Mariam,
  euen the Virgin Marie her selfe.</hi> For the name of Mother is terrestriall,
  temporall, and transitorie; but that kindred which is contracted by hearing
  Gods Word, is celestiall and euerlasting. If this doubt had had it's occasion
  thus, or that the case stood so, that this good and holy wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
  <hi>Marcella</hi> had not knowne and acknowledged our Sauiour Iesus Christ to
  be God, nor the blessed Virgin to be his mother, this
  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ence had then beene verie plaine,
  and no scruple to be made of it: for the dignitie of mother should not haue
  come to a lesser degree of grace, than that which the Virgin inioyed.</p>
               <p>The second sence or meaning is, That this particle <hi>Quin
  imo</hi> is <hi>comparatiua,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Virgin not blessed for
 bearing Christ but beleeuing in him.</note> comparatiuely spoken, or by way of
  comparison. Thou callest my mother bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, for that she is my mother; thou
  sayest well: but more blessed is shee in that she heares my Word. This sence is
  likewise taken out of Saint <hi>Augustine, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bro de sancta
  Virginitatepunc;</hi> Where he saith, <hi>Beatior suit Maria concipiendo
  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e, She bore him more happily in the Spirit, than the Flesh.</hi>
  This opinion is followed by Saint <hi>Cyprian, Iustine Martyr,</hi> and
  general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by all the moderne Doctours; and this of all other is the plainest,
  and that which doth best open o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <pb n="312" facs="tcp:22083:167"/>First, Because the Greeke word, which
  answereth to <hi>Quin imo,</hi> is neither a Negatiue, nor an Affirmatiue.</p>
               <p>Secondly, because this happinesse beeing granted vnto those who
  saw and beheld our Sauior Christ with their eyes; it is not to be supposed,
  that it should bee denyed to his Mother that had brought him foorth, and bred
  him vp. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, the Virgine said of her selfe, <hi>All nations shall call me
  blessed,</hi> Not only <hi>for that aboundance of grace</hi> which God had
  bestowed vpon her, but also for that he had inriched her with so many great
  priuiledges, whereof the dignitie of a Mother was not the least. Saint
  <hi>Austen</hi> indeering the greatnesse thereof saith, <hi>That the heart
  could not conceiue it, nor the tongue expresse it:</hi> And <hi>Anselmus,</hi>
  That next to the greatnesse of the Son, there was not any greatnesse either in
  Heauen or in Earth, which was any way comparable to that of the Mother: And S.
  <hi>Bernard,</hi> That by how much the more was her vicinitie with the word; by
  so much the more was her excellencie in Heauen. Whence some Schoolemen inferre,
  that this dignitie doth exceed al those other treasures of grace which were to
  be found in the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine. <hi>Iustine</hi> sayth of <hi>Olimpia,</hi> that
  howbeit she might boast herselfe much of the Kingdome of Troy, from whence she
  was descended, &amp; from other kingdomes which she might claime from her
  father, her brother, and her husband, who was <hi>Philip</hi> King of Macedon;
  yet could she glorie in no one thing more, than that she was Mother to
  <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, who was Emperor of the world. How much more
  strongly doth this reason hold in the most blessed Virgine?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">To bee the wife or daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a King a
 greater ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, than to be his Mother.</note>Yet notwithstanding all this,
  nothing comparable is the dignitie of a Mother to that of a daughter or a wife.
  And if it had bin left to this our most blessed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins choice, whether she
  had rather haue been the Mother of God, or his Spouse and best Beloued, shee
  would questionlesse haue rather chosen to haue beene his Beloued. And the same
  is implyed by those seueral imployments of <hi>Martha</hi> and <hi>Mary.</hi>
  As the Virgin was a Mother, she did <hi>Marthas</hi> office, affoording her

  to assist this louing Couple, and to keepe the Bridegroome and the Bride

               <p>The third sence and meaning, which is no lesse literall than the
  former, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supposeth two things:</p>
               <p>The one, That this woman was strucken into a double amazement or
  asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment.</p>
               <p>First, Of the strangenesse of the miracle.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Of the incredulitie and obstinacie of the
  Pharisees.</p>
               <p>The other, That these words are more directed to the praise and
  commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Sonne, than the Mother. And therefore when as here
  <hi>Marcella</hi> lifted vp her voyce and said, <hi>Blessed was that mother
  that brought thee forth, and the paps that gaue thee sucke</hi>; her maine and
  principall intent was, the commendation of her sonne, and inclusiuely an
  honouring likewise of the mother. But our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Christ was willing thereupon
  to shew and make knowne to the World, how vnequal an estimation this is, which
  we make of these kind of goods; for, to cast out Deuils, and the doing besides
  of strange and wonderfull miracles, worldly men, and those that looke onely on
  the outside of things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> preferre them vsually before the iustification of

  doost so much admire and wonder to see Deuills throwne out of mens bodies, thou
  wilt meruaile much more, to see them cast out of their soules. And being that
  my Word is so powerfull, as to free soules from this seruitude and tyrannie;
  more happie ought yee to hold mee, for those famous and renowned miracles which

               <p>Capernaum was a most faire &amp; beautifull Citie, as well in
  regard of the goods of Fortune, as of the nature of the Seat; it was scituated
  neere vnto the Sea, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the riuer of Iordan, in that most fertile and

  whence it came to passe, that they called it his Countrie, and his Citie.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Because he there first began to preach the Gospel;

  when he was more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous by the way of the sea beyond Iordan in Galilee, of
  the Gentiles; The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that walked in darkenesse haue seen a great light;

               <p>Thirdly, For those many miracles which he wrought therein; as
  that of him that was sicke of the Palsey, and let downe from the house top;

               <p>Fourthly, After his Resurrection hee threw a thousand fauours

  <hi>Natha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,</hi> who had fisht all night and caught nothing; willing them
  to cast the Net out vpon the right side of the Ship. And, as <hi>Brocardus</hi>
  reporteth it, vpon a stone of that riuer he left the print of the soles of his
  feet three seuerall times. With these his fauours he had stirred vp such enuies
  and jealousies in those of his own Countrie, that they said vnto him,
  <hi>Physition, heale thy selfe.</hi> But our Sauior Christ directed all these
  to the Nazarites good, to the end that these their jealousies might master
  their incredulitie and rebellion, and put spurres to their desires. A father
  hath two sonnes, one much made of, the other neglected and disgraced; this kind
  vsage makes the better beloued of the two, obstinate, churlish, and 
  <pb n="316" facs="tcp:22083:169"/> vnquiet: And because that jealousies and enuie may
  breake this his hardnesse of nature, and mollifie this his stubborne condition,
  he calls this slouenly, tat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd, and despised child of his, and sayes vnto
  him, Thou art my sonne and my beloued. This faire kind of course did God first
  take with the Iewes. For his loue to them did he plague Aegypt, diuide the sea,
  drowne <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> rob the Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians of their Iewells, suffered not
  their garments to grow old, nor their shooes on their feet to weare out, fed
  them with bread from Heauen, gaue them water out of the rocke, a Piller seruing
  them by night for a Torch, by day for a Tent: In conclusion, these his ouer
  great fauours and courtesies toward them, made them so hard hearted and so
  vnthankfull, that they prouoked God by a Calfe, giuing thereunto the glorie of
  their deliuerance out of Aegypt. This their adoring of a Beast was a strange
  kind of beastlinesse. God hereupon cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led this ragged child vnto him, and
  threw his loue vpon the Gentiles, who liued before in disfauour and disgrace;
  and said vnto the Gentile, Thou art my sonne. You see him now cast off,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Deut.</hi> 31.</note> that was yesterday a Fauourite, and
  carries that thom in his bosome, which doth continually pricke him: And
  therefore it is sayd, <hi>I will giue them a Spirit that shall sting them</hi>;
  a worme that shall still lie gnawing at the verie heart of them. Yesterday God
  had his house &amp; his habitation among the Iewes, his name was called vpon by
  them; but now you see them cast off, trodden vnder foot, trampled on, hated,
  abhorred, infamous, without honour, without a Citie, without a Temple, without
  Prophets. The calling of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, the miracles that are wrought amongst
  them, the many fauours that are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foorded them, are so many nayls driuen
  through their soules, &amp; with tears gut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring downe their cheekes, they now
  crie out with <hi>Ieremie, Our Inheritance is tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto strangers.</hi>
  Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith, That God did doe this of purpose, that through an
  emulation of zeale, the Iewes might bee conuerted vnto Christ. Which is all one
  with that of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

            <div type="part">
               <head>
                  <hi>Quanta audiuimus?</hi> What great things haue wee
  heard?</head>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Tis naturall in all men to loue their
 Country.</note>The reasons which they may alledge for themselues are these:</p>
               <p>First of all, Amongst those good seeds which God hath sowne in
  our brest, one is, The loue of our Countrie: Many haue preferred it before the
  loue of friends, kindred, parents, nay, before themselues, their estates, and
  liues. <hi>Thomas</hi> saith, That next vnto God we ought not to beare so much
  loue to anything, as to our Countrie: he prooues it to be an heroicall vertue,
  to enioy that name, for the which we respect God, to wit, Pittie. And they that
  denie this loue vnto their Countrie, we hold them to be men deuoyd of pittie,
  barbarous, and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> in his Bookes <hi>De Ciuitate
  Dei, Thomas,</hi> and <hi>Valerius Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> quote many examples of men
  most famous in their loue to their Country: As of one <hi>Codrus,</hi> whose
  enemies hauing receiued answer from the Oracle, That if <hi>Codrus</hi> should
  be slaine in the battell, they should lose the victorie; entred in disguise, of
  purpose to be killed. Of <hi>Curtius,</hi> who for Romes safetie desperat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
  leaped into that deepe pit. Of <hi>Sylla's</hi> Host in Praeneste, who taking
  that city by force of Armes, and making Proclamation, That all the Citisens
  should be put to the sword, saue his host; said, I wil not receiue my life from
  him that is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyer of my Countrie. Of one <hi>Thrasibulus,</hi> whom
  the Athenians went forth to receiue with so many Crownes as they were Citisens.
  Numberlesse are those examples which wee find in prophane stories. And in those
  that are sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred <pb n="317" facs="tcp:22083:169"/> we meet with that one of
  <hi>Dauid,</hi> and that other of <hi>Iudith,</hi> who aduentured their liues
  for their Countrie. In a word, Nature (as Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> saith)
  plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this loue with that deepe rooting in our brests, that <hi>Lucian</hi>
  said, That the smoke of our owne Chimnies was farre better than the fire of
  other mens. And <hi>Plutarch</hi> affirmeth, That euerie man commends the ayre
  of his owne Country. <hi>Hierocles</hi> stiles this loue, a new God, and our
  first and greatest father. <hi>Silius Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> introduceth a father
  notifying to his sonne, That not any fouler sinne did descend vnto Hell, than a
  mans opposing himselfe against his owne Countrie.</p>
               <p>This loue being so due a debt, and so deseruing our pittie, it
  causeth no small admiration, that Christ our Sauior should grow so cold toward
  his owne Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, and multiplie such a companie of miracles vpon other the
  Cities of Iudea and Israell, and performe so few in Nazareth, where he was
  bred.</p>
               <p>Secondly, This difficultie is increased by the Nazarites iust
  request; alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, That since he had preached in his owne Citie such a new
  and strange kind of Doctrine, there was a great deale of reason that he should
  confirme the same by miracles: For, put case that this had not beene his owne
  natiue Country, yet was it a generall debt, which he had paid to other
  Cities.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, because in expounding that place of <hi>Esay,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Esay</hi> 61.1.</note> 
                  <hi>The Spirit of the Lord is vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me,
  because he hath annointed me, that I should preach the Gospell to the
  poore,</hi> he said, That that prophecie was fulfilled in himself, being that
  annointed Messias there spoken of: Which being so, it was fit that hee should
  prooue it by those signes and miracles which were prophecied of the
  Messias.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Marc.</hi> 6.5.</note> This
  difficultie is indeered by that which the Euangelist S. <hi>Marke</hi>
  reporteth of our Sauiour Christ; to wit, That hee could doe no great workes in
  Nazareth: As if his vertue and power had beene hindered and debarred of doing
  them; insomuch that it made our Sauiour Christ to meruaile much at it.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, If the sinnes of Nazareth did thus bind his hands, more
  were those of Capernaum, which he compared to Sodome;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luc.</hi> 10.</note> 
                  <hi>For if the miracles had beene done in
  Tyrus and Sydon which haue beene done in you, they had a great while a goe
  repented, sitting in Sackcloth and Ashes. Therefare it shall be easier for
  Tyrus and Sydon at the Iudgement, than for you.</hi> Greater were those of
  Bethsaida and Chorazin; <hi>Vae tibi Bethsayda, vae tibi Chorazin &amp;c.</hi>
  And greater were those of Ierusalem;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Math.</hi>
 11.</note> whereof <hi>Ezechiel</hi> said, <hi>Samaria dimidium peccatorum
  tuorum non peccauit, vicisti eas sceleri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus tuis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixtly, He had done other greater honours to Nazareth; there he
  was incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated in the wombe of the Virgin <hi>Marie,</hi> which of all other
  miracles was the greatest. He tooke his name from Nazareth, as it appeareth by
  that his title vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Crosse; by that which the Deuills roared forth; and by
  that which our Sauiour himselfe said to Saint <hi>Paul, I am Iesus of Nazareth,
  Ego sum Iesus Nazare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, &amp;c.</hi> And therefore hauing giuen the more, it
  was not much hee should giue the lesse.</p>
               <p>Seuenthly, Miracles were that milke which the Iews were bred vp
  with, and had beene antiently accustomed vnto, <hi>Iudea signa petunt, &amp;c.
  The Iewes demand a signe. Esay</hi> importuned King <hi>Achab,</hi> That he
  would aske signes from Heauen, Earth, or Hell; <hi>Pete tibi signum à
  Domino, &amp;c. Moses</hi> and <hi>Gideon</hi> desired signes, and therefore
  his children should haue beene bettered thereby, and more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially those of
  his owne Countrie. After that <hi>Ioseph</hi> had furnished Aegypt with corne,
  he set open Granaries to the neighbouring Prouinces.</p>
               <p>Lastly, It was prophecied of the Messias, That hee should bee no
  accepter of persons: He was Lord of al, &amp; to al (in al reason) he should
  shew himselfe equall <pb n="318" facs="tcp:22083:170"/> and indifferent: so that it seemeth
  to carrie a great shew of sorrow and resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with it, which those of
  Nazareth obiected vnto him; <hi>We haue heard what thou hast done in Capernaum,
  doe it here likewise in thine owne Countrie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But for the better vnderstanding of that which our Sauior Christ
  did answer to this complaint and accusation of theirs;</p>
               <p>First of all, we must suppose, That our Sauiour Christ shewed
  himselfe with his most blessed Mother, in foure occasions: For albeit it bee a
  holy thing for the children to honour their parents; yet this honour is to be
  done them when Gods cause interposeth not it selfe, who is the vniuersall
  Father of vs all. But when there shall be an incounter of our liking and loue
  towards two seueral fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, he that created me, and he that begot mee; wee
  are to haue recourse vnto our heauenly Father, in regard of whom, all the other
  fathers in the world are but Stepfathers. In this sence Saint <hi>Gregorie</hi>
  doth expound that place of Saint <hi>Luke,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke</hi>
 14.</note> 
                  <hi>He that forsaketh not father and mother to follow me, is not
  worthie of me.</hi> Which is to be vnderstood in such things which appertaine
  to our spiritual saluation; as it is noted by the said Doctor, and <hi>Clemens
  Alexandrinus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Christs works of two sorts.</note>Secondly,
  Saint <hi>Austen</hi> noteth, That in our Sauiour Christ two kind of works may
  be considered:</p>
               <p>The one, Of a pure Man.</p>
               <p>The other, Of a Redeemer and heauenly Master.</p>
               <p>In the first, he was subiect to his mother, and his father
  <hi>Ioseph</hi>: so saith S. <hi>Luke, Et erat subditus illis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the second, he was to haue recourse vnto his heauenly Father;
  And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he said, <hi>Nesciabitis, quod in his quae patris mei sunt,
  oportet me esse?</hi> He was at the Wedding by his mothers appointment; but
  when hee came to the working of the miracle, he said, <hi>Quid mihi &amp; tibi
  Mulier? Woman, what haue I to doe with thee?</hi> And when they aduised him
  whilest he was preaching, That his mother and his Kinsefolkes were waiting
  there for him; hee answered, <hi>Quae est M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, We haue two Countries:</p>
               <p>Earth the one.</p>
               <p>Heauen the other.</p>
               <p>In that, our Bodies were borne.</p>
               <p>In this, our Soules.</p>
               <p>Now, when the desires of the Earth incounter with those of
  Heauen, our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course must be to Heauen: following therein the aduice of
  <hi>Dauid, Audi Fili<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, &amp; vide,
  obliuiscere populum tuum, &amp; domus patris tui, Heare ô Daughter, and
  see, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get thy owne people, and the house of thy father.</hi> Our Sauiours
  naturall Countrie was Heauen; but here on earth, Nazareth. Now this Countrie
  did not desire miracles for to increase their beleefe, but for other respects,
  which wee will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare hereafter: And therefore Christ would not worke any
  miracles amongst them.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Why our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour would worke no mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles in
 Caper<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>naum.</note>And assuming those reasons which Christ might alledge for
  himselfe:</p>
               <p>The first is prooued by that Prouerbe which our Sauiour cited,
  <hi>No Prophet is accepted in his owne Countrie.</hi> Or as Saint
  <hi>Mathew</hi> and Saint <hi>Marke</hi> haue it <hi>There is no Prophet that
  is honoured in his owne Countrie, nay rather doth not suffer
  dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this is made good both by diuine and humane learning; and
  there are more instances thereof, than there are sands in the sea.
  <hi>Moses</hi> being but a child, his parents put him into the riuer, leauing

  answer, Because she doth not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie the bad, but the good. <hi>Caine</hi>

  a man may do to himself and others, our wishes against that man proceeds not so
  much of Enuy as of Zeale. And so is it noted by S. <hi>Gregorie.</hi> A Tyrant
  goes foorth with the <hi>Vare</hi> of an <hi>Alcalde de corte</hi>; it greeues
  me, and I am heartily sorry <pb n="320" facs="tcp:22083:171"/> for the harme that hee doth

  That it is charitie to desire the hurt of a mans bodie, for the good of his
  soule. According to that of <hi>Dauid, Imple facies eorum igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minia, &amp;

  Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is that sorrow which I receiue for myne enemies good fortune, to bee
  ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med so much enuie, as enmitie. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, That euerie

  deliuered by <hi>Aristotle</hi> in his <hi>Rhethorickes.</hi> The Inferiour
  enuieth the Superior, because he is not equal vnto him; the Superiour, the
  Inferiour, lest he should come to equall him.</p>
               <p>The principall harmes of this vice are three:</p>

  easily effecteth: for, whatsoeuer is first soured by the Will, is euer ill

               <p>The second, If the prosperitie be verie notorious indeed, it
  torments the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie heart of the Enuious, for that it is an eclipsing and
  obscuring of his reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and honour.</p>
               <p>The third, When the Enuious can no other way doe him hurt, he
  endeauors to take away the life of him that is enuied; as <hi>Caine</hi> did
  <hi>Abels,</hi> and as <hi>Saul</hi> would haue done the like by
  <hi>Dauid.</hi> And for that those of Nazareth did behold our Sauiour Christ,
  when at most, to be their equall; and seeing that hee dispeopled Townes, and
  peopled dispeopled Deserts, they did so much enuie this his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, that first
  of all they did not beleeue in him: secondly, they sought to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit him;
  and not being able otherwise to hurt him, they went about to breake his
  necke.</p>
               <p>Some one perhaps will aske me, What aduantage the Naturall hath
  of the Stranger, for to set such an edge on our enuie? I answer, <hi>That too
  much familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie causeth contempt,</hi> and this our Sauiours conuersing with
  them, was the cause of their neglecting of him. To be Towne-borne children, to
  be bred vp from the cradle to the Schoole, and from the Schoole, to boyes
  sports and pastimes, is a great enemie to the future co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiuing of a worthie
  opinion of that Prophet, Iudge, or Gouernour. And therefore it is well obserued
  by Saint <hi>Ierome, They doe not weigh his present worth, but haue an eye to
  his former infancie.</hi> They that are neerest Neighbours to a good Corrector
  or Inquisitor, are farthest off from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing a good opinion of him.
  <hi>Plutarch</hi> saith, That the spots in the Moone arise from the vapours of
  the earth, for that the earth is neerer to this than any other of the Planets.
  And, as it is in the <hi>Prouerbes, Laruin vezinzad, siempre man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha</hi>; None

                  <note place="margin">Admiration waits not, but on things that are
 rare.</note>Besides, Common things neuer cause admiration: according to that of
  Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> touching the iustification of our soules. For though
  this bee a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter miracle than the casting of Deuills out of our bodies, yet
  we make no such wonder of it. And in another place he saith, That the motion of
  the Heauens, the influences of the Planets, the course of the Starres, the
  Waters, Winds, and Tempests, are meruailous miracles; for albeit that they keep
  on in their course by the order of nature, yet, that nature should conserue
  this order for so many Ages, it is a verie great miracle: yet wee make no such
  wonder of it. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause our Countrie, and al that good which it containeth
  (<hi>es pan casero de cada dis</hi>) is euerie day bred with vs, wee make no
  such wonder of it, it is not dainty vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs; and because it is common, we

                  <pb n="321" facs="tcp:22083:171"/>Againe, there is this difference betwixt
  secular and Ecclesiasticall Princes; That in them we loue the succession of
  bloud, &amp; much esteem of this line all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent in nature; and for this
  cause we couet a naturall King, and abhorre the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of a Crowne or
  Scepter. But in these other, we couet strangers, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre our owne bloud,
  it seeming vnto vs, That Wisedome and Prudence is treasured vp in some more
  hidden and secret place: making vse of that saying of <hi>Iob, Sapientia de
  occultis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second reason why our Sauior did not doe those miracles the
  Nazarites desired, was, To teach both Prince and Prelate not to haue an eye to
  flesh and bloud, but to worth and desert. <hi>Iudas</hi> his Bishopricke being
  voyd, two worthie persons were in competition for it, <hi>Matthias</hi> and
  <hi>Ioseph,</hi> who being our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours Kinseman, had the syrname of
  <hi>Iust</hi>: but the lot fell vpon <hi>Matthias,</hi> because no man should
  presume to thinke, that flesh and bloud should strike the stroke with God.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 4.</note> The Iewes had the descendencie of
  <hi>Abraham</hi> for their refuge and defence, but Saint <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi>
  did aduise them, That the boasting of their pede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree would be no safe
  Sanctuarie for them to flie from Gods anger. For the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to flesh and
  bloud must not make a Prince to swarue from the way of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, like those
  Kyne that carried the Arke to Beth shemesh. That there is a
  <hi>Melchisedech</hi> that neither acknowledgeth father nor mother, nor any
  genealo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, it is a great priuiledge of diuine both fauour and power.
  <hi>Ismael</hi> pretended the birthright by the flesh; <hi>Isaac,</hi> by the
  Spirit: but when God came to sentence this businesse, he said, <hi>Eijce
  ancillam &amp; filiumeius, Put them both out of house and home, mother and
  sonne.</hi> The mother was in no fault; but God would not that the sonne should
  gather heart by his mothers presence. By the same Plea did <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meleck</hi>
  the sonne of <hi>Gideon</hi> pretend the Kingdome; <hi>Os vestrum &amp; caro

                  <hi>I am your bone
  and your flesh.</hi> In the Pallaces of your earthly Princes this poynt is much
  stood vpon; but the Prince of Heauen could not be drawne out of this respect to
  doe any miracles in Nazareth.</p>
               <p>The third reason was,<note place="margin">To chal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>enge any thing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God as due, is the
 way to go without it.</note> because the Nazarites seemed to claime these
  things of our Sauior, as it were by right, and as their due; when as God doth
  confer these his heauenly blessings vpon vs, meerely of grace: we can challenge
  nothing, it is his bountie that we must be beholding vnto. Saint
  <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith, That our Sauiour Christ cured strangers, and not those
  of Nazareth that were his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimen, <hi>Because this medicine was of grace,
  not of place</hi>; not tyed to their Nation, but his inclination. Diuine
  blessings are conferred by creation, not transferred by propagation: it is like
  vnto your shoures in May, which go scudding and coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting along, leauing (as
  <hi>Amos</hi> saith) one field wet, and another drie: and this is a kind of
  fortune or lot that falls vpon one that least thinkes of it; and this Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
  of Lot is often vsed in Scripture. Those of Capernaum,<note place="margin">

 <hi>Eph.</hi> 1</note> those of Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saida, those of Chorazin, and those of
  Ierusalem, were happely greater sinners than they; but God did not remooue from
  them neither his Miracles nor his Doctrine. But no farther reason hereof is to
  be required, than Gods owne wil, who may doe with his owne what he thinkes
  good.</p>
               <p>The fourth reason for confirmation of what is past, may be the
  Nazarites cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riositie; Why more here, than there? Or why more to that man, than
  to mee? And other innumerable demands which the Flesh is woont to propose. It
  is a kind of rashnesse, not to submit our vnderstanding to Gods diuine
  prouidence: this is a smoke that blinds the eyes of Reason, it is a buzzing
  about the coelesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all flame, like the Butter-flie that flutters about the
  light of a candle, who, <hi>quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendo lucem, inuenit lathum, seeking after
  light, scortches her wings, and procures her <pb n="322" facs="tcp:22083:172"/> death.</hi>
  The generall cause (aske thou neuer so many questions) is the will of God; this
  is <hi>causa causarum, the cause of causes.</hi> Why were more miracles wrought
  in Capernaum, than in Nazareth? <hi>Voluntas Dei est,</hi> (saith
  <hi>Saluianus</hi>) Why? <hi>God would haue it so.</hi> Now, to aske of God a
  reason of his wil, is, as if a slaue should aske the same of his Master, a

  the rising of these Riuers, would haue pretended to haue made a discouerie of

  they should haue gone on in the pursuit of this their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, either through
  want of prouision in those sandie and desert places, or through the
  inaccessablenesse of those mountaines that interposed themselues; or through
  the barbarousnesse and crueltie of the people bordering there abouts.</p>

 Incrudelity, a maine stop to Christs, Miracles.</note>The fift reason is set
  downe by Saint <hi>Mathew,</hi> and Saint <hi>Marke; Hee wrought not many
  miracles there, by reason of their incredulitie</hi>: Not that he hated his
  owne Countrie, which he had so much honoured with his Conception, (saith the
  In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlinearie) but for Nazareths incredulitie. And this is made apparent by
  that <hi>Fac &amp; hic in Patria tua</hi>: In other places they talke much of
  thy many and great miracles, but this Citie will not beleeue there is any such
  thing: and yet thou hast heere the same power thou hadst there; Therefore,
  <hi>Fac &amp; hic in patria tu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>,
  Medice, cura teipsum.</hi> How can we beleeue, that thou doost such famous
  Cures in other Countries, when as thou sufferest thyne owne Countrimen and
  thyne owne Kinsefolke to be sicke? The like argument was vsed by the Scribes
  and Pharisees at the foot of the Crosse, <hi>This man saued others, and cannot
  saue himselfe</hi>; How should we beleeue, that by his power he freed so many,
  beeing hee cannot free himselfe? Let him come downe from the Crosse, and saue
  himselfe, &amp; then we will beleeue he is the Sonne of God.</p>
               <p>Our Sauiour Christ prooued this their incredulitie by two
  examples:</p>
               <p>The one, Of <hi>Elias,</hi> who when the Countrie was much
  oppressed with Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, God sent him to a woman of Sydonia, to the end that she
  should sustaine <pb n="323" facs="tcp:22083:172"/> him. And this poore Widdow woman hauing
  in all her house nothing more in the world but a little meale, onely with one
  words speaking of the Prophets mouth, spent a great part thereof in making a
  Cake for him, baking it on the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; repairing <hi>Elias</hi> his present
  necessitie with the hazard of her owne life and her sonnes: and hauing so much
  reason as she had on her side, to doubt of the Prophets promise, That she
  should neither want meale nor oyle till it should rain in Israell. For
  <hi>Elias</hi> not being able to succour himselfe, shee might verie well
  suspect with her selfe, How he should be able to relieue others. This was a
  great and wonderfull excellencie of Faith; it is much celebrated by S.
  <hi>Ambrose</hi> and Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi>; and our Sauiour Christ
  counterponeth it to the incredulitie of Nazareth.</p>
               <p>The second example is of <hi>Naaman</hi> the Syrian, who
  beleeued that she-slaue of Israel, who told him, There was a Prophet in Samaria
  that could cure him of his Leaprosie: and crauing leaue of the King, because he
  was Captaine generall of all his men of Warre, he came to the Land of Israell
  to seeke out <hi>Elisha,</hi> bringing great gifts and rich presents along with
  him: and washing himselfe in Iordan seuen times, (though at first he beleeued,
  that with his word onely hee was able to cure him) he left with his disease,
  the errour of his Idolatrie. In a word, hee well deserued that the Prophet
  should heale him; but those Leapers of his owne Countrie did not deserue the
  like fauour, for their incredulitie. And other Cities receiuing the benefit of
  his miracles, these that were his owne Natiues missed of them. The word
  <hi>Audiuimus</hi> doth condemne them: For this alone was sufficient for their
  Faith, <hi>Fides ex auditu, Faith comes by hearing</hi>; and the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles had
  no other testimonies.</p>
               <p>Besides, Nazareth was made partaker of many powerful
  testimonies; as that testimonie of S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> of that voyce from the
  Father; of the comming down of the Holy-Ghost in the likenesse of a Doue; as
  also those Testimonies of the Scripture, which were seene to be fulfilled in
  him; besides the testimonie of his Doctrine, <hi>For he taught them as one
  hauing authoritie, and not as the Scribes.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 7.29.</note> And the testimonie of his life, that
  was so blamelesse, that (as <hi>Thomas</hi> saith) it did qualifie his
  Doctrine. So that his life was a greater testimonie than his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; and his
  Doctrine, than his Miracles: And hee that will not beleeue the more, will
  hardly beleeue the lesse.</p>
               <p>The sixt, In not shewing any miracles amongst them, hee shewed
  therein the more loue to his Countrie:<note place="margin">God somtimes neuer
 more our friend, than when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies vs our re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>quests.</note> For if these his
  miracles would haue done Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth any good, this their accusation might haue
  seemed somwhat iust; but being that they would haue turned to their hurt, and
  beeing that this their enuie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, would from a great good haue drawne
  greater hurt, and from a great fauour, greater ingratitude, and more
  incredulitie; the lesse he did, the more was his loue. This did our Sauiour

  did, they should haue no sinne.</hi>

  <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, That God grants vs many things when he is angrie with
  vs, which when he is friends with vs he denies vs. So that he shewed himselfe a

  desired, than if he had granted their request; because they would haue serued
  but for their farther condemnation. The Seruant that knowes his Masters will,

  as in the Flood, the burning of Sodome, and the swallowing vp of

  themselues therein his true children. So that our Sauiour might verie well say
  that vnto them, which he said to the Pharisees, It is the nature of the Deuills
  sonnes, to fulfill the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires of such a Father. God commanded
  <hi>Abraham,</hi> That he should sacrifice his sonne; and the Deuill being
  desirous to equall God, commanded the Gentiles to sacrifice their sonnes;
  <hi>They did sacrifice their sonnes and daughters to Deuils.

                  </hi> that wicked King of
  Israel, applying himselfe to the desires of the Deuill, the 
  <pb n="325" facs="tcp:22083:173"/> Scripture giues this touch, That he did sacrifice his

               <p>The eighth reason is, That faintnesse and weakenesse, that
  lukewarmenesse, or rather coldnesse, wherewith the Nazarites did desire these
  miracles from Christ. And these their poore diligences, may sufficiently bee
  prooued by this, That they neuer went out of their own Citie, nor left their
  houses, for to heare our Sauior, or to see his miracles, as those of Iudea and
  Ierusalem did by troups, and others that flockt vnto him from the vtmost
  borders of Tyrus and Sydon. Neither did they send any embassage or message vnto
  him, entreating him to come vnto them; nor so much as bring any sicke bodie
  vnto him to bee cured. Whereas Capernaum did dispeople it selfe, to goe forth
  to heare his Word. The Centurion came forth likewise to seeke him, beseeching
  him humbly on his knee, That he would be pleased to make his Seruant whole.
  Others did vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile their house, to let downe him vnto him that was sicke of the
  Palsey, &amp;c. The comparison of one that followes a suit in Law of his owne,
  which imports him much; and of him that followes another mans cause, which
  concernes him little: the diligences of the one, and the carelesnesse of the
  other, are true em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems of the different conditions of Christians. Some follow
  the businesse of their saluation earnestly and industriously; other-some

  from the vtmost parts of the earth, to seeke after the wisedome of <hi>Salomon,

  were enough to condemne Nazareth.</p>
               <p>The ninth; It might happely bee, That Nazareth did desire
  miracles, for the honour and glorie that might thereby redound vnto her; as
  that it might be noysed abroad in the world, That a Citisen of theirs, a
  Towne-borne child of their owne, had done these and these famous miracles, such
  and such singular wonders; and that she was to bee esteemed as Ladie and
  Mistresse of this so rare and rich a Treasure; and that our Sauiour being borne
  there, he was bound (as they thought) to keepe house there, and to make
  Nazareth the onely seat of his ordinarie residence. The loue of honour amongst
  Citisens, is so sauorie and so sweet a thing, that <hi>Cicero</hi> in many
  places stickes not to say, That there is not any <pb n="326" facs="tcp:22083:174"/> thing
  that Nature doth more couet: &amp; that men are not so much to esteem the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> liues for the present, as that fame
  which is to liue in their posteritie. <hi>Celebremus nomen nostrum,</hi> said

  your Scutchions, your Armes, your Coats, your Tombes, your Sepulchres, and

               <p>The Nazarites likewise might verie well desire miracles for
  temporall ends, as well for the Citie in generall, as themselues in particular.

  the Virgin <hi>de la Charidad</hi> should do famous miracles, to the end that
  some might grow rich by entertaining of guests; others, by selling of fruits;
  others, by their seruice and attendance, &amp;c. And so was it with these of
  Nazareth; but they tooke their mark amisse, in seeking to shut vp such great
  glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie in so narrow and little a corner of the world, as that was, confining
  him to a <hi>Fac &amp; hic in patria tua</hi>; When <hi>Peter</hi> would in

               <p>Not necessarie, because many haue beene, and dayly are conuerted

                  <note place="margin">Miracles not necessarie to Saluation, nor

  miracles could not conuert a <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> a <hi>Iudas,</hi> or a <hi>Symon

  <hi>Signa nostra non vidimus.</hi> God doth not now work mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles in his owne
  Countrie, nor in our Church, his owne Spouse and best belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. Those former
  times were much more happie, and farre more inriched, not onely with his
  miracles, but also with those of his Seruants: <hi>Peter</hi> did heale with
  his shadow; <hi>Stephen</hi> saw the Heauens opened; <hi>Philip</hi> in Samaria
  did cure by hundreds. There is no Arithmeticke that can summe vp the full
  number of those wonders that they wrought. And now it seemeth that the
  fountaine of his grace is drawne drie: But the truth is, That forasmuch as the
  Church then was in her infancie, and as it were but new crept out of the shell,
  there was a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie of the working of them; but after that the Church was

  there was no such great need of them. Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> saith, That the

  Meale. O (sayth one) if I could but once see a miracle, if an Angell should but
  speake to me, if a dead man should arise and speake vnto me, &amp;c. What
  should I not then doe? But the truth of it is, That he that will not beleeue
  the Scriptures, will not beleeue an Angell that comes from Heauen, nor one that
  shall arise from the dead. Though God neuer yet was, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Another cause of this their cruell determination, for to throw

  and our King. A brace of fierce beasts, I assure you; Enuie first opened the
  doore to all those euils that are in the world: <hi>By the Deuils enuie death

  the Deuill were the Author thereof, yet did Enuy put spurs to his heeles. The

  them. And Saint <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> That it is a lesser euill to haue a

  that goes to bed in anger, inuites the Deuill to be his bedfellow, There is not

  and wrought in the forge of an angrie mans brest.<note place="margin">

                  <hi>A stone is heauie, and the sand

               <p>Now to say, Which of these two furies is the fiercest? is not so
  easie a thing to be decided: For, if Enuie be kindled vpon light occasions, as
  that little short Song which the Dames of Hierusalem sung in <hi>Dauids</hi>
  commendation; if it be so large sighted, that our neighbours fields of Corne,
  and his flockes of Sheepe seeme better and bigger than our owne;
  <hi>Iosephs</hi> partie coloured Coate see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming better to his bretheren, than
  those Sheepeheards mantles wherewith themselues were clad: if it be the vice of
  little children, <hi>Parvulum occidi inuidia</hi>; What shall wee say then to
  the impetuousnesse of Anger, and the violence of Wrath? Or who is able to
  withstand it's rage? Anger is cruell, and wrath is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Prou.</hi> 27.4.</note> saith <hi>Salomon</hi>; but he
  concludes with this short come-off, Who can stand before Enuie? Who will oppose
  himselfe to the violent and swift torrent of a Riuer that sweepes all before
  it? Such a thing is Anger, for the time it lasteth: but that will slacke againe
  of it selfe, as your Spring-tydes fall backe againe into their owne beds. But
  Enuie will not so soone shift her foot, she wil abide by it, and neuer giue
  ouer. And Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> renders the reason of it, <hi>Quia non habet
  terminum;</hi> it is not to be limitted, but like a Worme or a Canker, by
  little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle rotteth and consumeth the bones; <hi>Salomon</hi> calls it,

  Enuie, a plague; and if another great Phylosopher call it <hi>Monstrum
  monstrorum, the Monster of monsters,</hi> and the most venimous Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par vpon
  earth: Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> here on the other side saith, That the Deuill
  being in mans bosome, is lesse hurtfull than Anger. Much hath beene spoken of
  Enuie, and much of Anger; and that ill cannot be said of the one, which may not
  be affirmed of the other. So that this proposed doubt (Which is the worst Beast
  of the two?) may remaine for a probleme; which let others resolue, for I
  cannot. But (which makes fit for our purpose) beeing both such fierce Beasts as
  we haue deliuered vnto you, they did both conspire against our Sauiour Christ,
  leading him here to the edge of a hill whereon their Citie was built, to cast
  him downe headlong: and afterwards neuer leaft persecuting him til they had
  nailed him to the Crosse.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And they cast him out of the Synagogue. &amp;c.
  Aristotle</hi> saith, That Man gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning himselfe according to the Lawes and

  properly, the King of all other li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Creatures: but if he shut his eyes, and
  wil not see reason, he is more fierce and cruell than all of them put together.
  The reason is, because other creatures neuer passe beyond the bounds of their
  fiercenesse and crueltie, receiue they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer so much wrong; <hi>Incursus suos,

  Temple; those of Nazareth, to the edge of the hill on the side or skirt whereof
  their city was built. The Deuill did onely persuade him to cast himselfe downe
  from thence; but the Nazarites would haue done this by force. These (saith
  <hi>Ambrose</hi>) were the Deuills Disciples, but farre worse than their
  Master. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, That there are some men that inuent new
  mischiefes, <hi>Inuentores malorum.</hi> And the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill being the vniuersall

  not passing the bounds of Gods diuine will and Empire, the Deuill is more

  tumble him downe, thereby to worke his death: That with the losse of his owne
  life, and the price of his most pretious bloud, hee should redeeme them from
  death; and that they in this vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankefull and vnciuile manner should goe about
  to take away his life. O, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull People! God was not willing to bestow
  any miracles on them, who would not entertaine so great a miracle. God vseth to
  requite the thankes of one fauour, with conferring another greater than the

  Nay, in some sort this their wrong was greater than that which Hierusalem did

  but Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in a most furious manner, like the common people when they are in

  was most graced and fauored by him, if it be so gracelesse as to prooue
  vngratefull. When God carried <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiel</hi> in spirit to the Temple,
  discouering great abhominations vnto him, and said vnto him, These things my
  People commit, <hi>Vt procul recedam à Sanctuario meo,</hi> They giue

  hath he departed from Israell, from Asia, Affrica, &amp; many other parts of
  Europ, forsaking so many cities &amp; temples so much heretofore fauored by
  him, and so much made of. Nazareth signifies a Floure, a Crowne, or a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;
  and the Nazarites were once the onely Floures in Gods Garden, that is, in his
  Church; they were religious persons that were consecrated to his seruice, and
  therefore Nazareth is by them more particularly called Christs own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie,

  Nazarits, <hi>Ierem.</hi> doth lament, Thatthey being more white than milke,

  Therfore in Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges and religious places, with whom God communicates his

  vs. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> in his last sicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse prayed ouer the
  penitentiall Psalmes, and shedding many teares, sayd, That though a man were
  neuer so iust and righteous, yet was hee not to die without penitence. Saint
  <hi>Chrysostome</hi> tells vs, That when Feare at the houre of death doth set
  vpon the Soule, burning as it were with fire, all the goods of this life, she
  enforceth her with a deep and profound consideration, to meditate on those of
  that other life which is to come. And although a mans sinnes bee neuer so
  light, yet then they seeme so great and so heauie, that they oppresse the
  heart. And as a piece of timber whilest it is in the water, any the weakest
  arme is able to mooue it, but beeing brought to the shore hath need of greater
  strength; so sin whilest it floateth on the waters of this life, seemeth light
  vnto vs, but being brought to the brinke of death, it is verie weightie, and it
  will require a great deale of leisure, consideration, and grace, to land it
  well and handsomely, and to rid our hands of it. Of this good, sudden death
  depriueth vs: And although it is apparent in Scripture, That God doth sometimes
  permit the Iust to die a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den death, as <hi>Origen,</hi> Saint
  <hi>Gregorie,</hi> and <hi>Athanasius</hi> Bishop of Nice affirmeth; as in
  <hi>Iobs</hi> children, on whom the house fell when they were making
  merrie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in those who died with the fall of the Tower of Siloah; who
  according to our Sauiours testimonie, were no such notorious sinners, yet
  commonly this is sent by God as a punishment for their sinnes. <hi>Mors

  <hi>Recedet in Spiritu oris sui,</hi> He shal die before he be sicke, without
  any paine, in the middest of his mirth, when he is sound and lustie. Their life
  being a continuall pleasure, at their death they scarce feele any paine,
  because it is <hi>in puncto, in an instant. Sophonias</hi> requireth of them,
  That they will thinke on that day before it come,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Esay</hi> 30.</note> wherein God will scatter them like the

  moment; and the breaking thereof shall be like the breaking of a Potters pot,
  and in the breaking thereof there shall not bee found a sheard to take fire out
  of the hearth, or to take water out of the pit. And the word <hi>Requisita</hi>
  mentioned by the Prophet, intimateth a strong wall that is vndermined, &amp;
  rusheth downe on the sudden. How much their securitie is the more, so much the
  more is their danger, because it takes the soldiers vnawares. But if this so

  into so many fitters &amp; seuerall lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle pieces, that there would not a
  sheard therof be left for to take vp so much as an handfull of water, or to
  fetch a little fire from our next Neighbours house. This effect doth sudden
  death worke, it is a desperat destruction to a sinner: And therefore Christ
  (though without sin) seeks to shun it, that he might teach thee that art a
  Sinner, to auoyd it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, our Sauior sought to shun this violent death, because
  his death was reserued for the Crosse, as well because it was a kind of long
  and lingering death, as also for diuers other conueniencies, which wee haue

  miracles among them, as he had in other places, he was willing now at his
  departure from them, to shew them one of his greatest miracles, by taking their
  strength from them, hindring the force of their armes, and leauing them much
  astonished and dismayed. Though now and then God doth deferre his punishments,
  for that the sinnes of the Wicked are not yet come to their full growth; yet we
  see that he spared not his Angels, nor those whom he afterwards drowned in the
  Floud, nor those of Sodome, nor of others lesse sinnefull than they, nor his
  owne children of Israell, of all that huge number (being more in number than
  the sands of the sea) not suffering aboue two to enter into the land of
  Promise; how is it possible that hee should endure the petulancie of this
  peremptorie people, these grumbling Nazarites, who in such a rude and vnciuill
  fashion, in such an imperious and commanding voice, should presume to say vnto
  him, taking the matter in such deepe dudgeon, <hi>Fac &amp; hic in Patria

  fell backward on the ground at his <hi>Ego sum, I am hee</hi>; which was a

  could haue wrought so powerfull an effect: so now passing through the midst of
  them with a graue and setled pace, leauing them troubled, angrie, &amp; amased,
  hee prooued thereby vnto them, That he was the Lord and giuer both of life and

deere our former wickednesse and forepassed sinnes cost our Sauiour; Man should
be so affraid of offending, that hee should neuer returne to sinne any
more.</p>
            <p>Some may happily aske me the question, Why the death and passion
of our <pb n="335" facs="tcp:22083:178"/> Sauiour beeing so powerfull and effectuall a
remedie against all kind of vices whatsoeuer, yet sinne still reigneth so much
in the World, as neuer more. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto I answere, That vpon the Crosse, our
Sauiour Christ gaue sentence against all whatsoeuer, both present, past, and
those that were to come. And depriued the Prince of the World of that
Seigniorie which he possessed, so that all of them were to suffer death and to
haue an end. But they did appeale from this sentence of death, to the Tribunall
of our passions; And for that they are such interres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed &amp; such blind
Iudges, they haue set these our Vices againe at libertie, giuing them licence
to worke vs as much, if not more harme than they did before. So that Gods
sending of his sonne into the World, and his suffering death for our sinnes,
did not generally banish all vice, but did serue rather to some for their
greater condemnation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If thy brother shall trespasse (In te) against thee.</hi>
Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> expoundeth this <hi>In te,</hi> to be <hi>contra
te</hi>; and in this sence it ought to be taken: for it is the expresse letter
of the former Texts, as also of those that follow, and generally agreed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by all the Doctors: The Interlinearie hath it, <hi>Si te contumelia
affecerit.</hi> Saint <hi>Peter</hi> anon after askes our Sauiour, How oft
shall my brother sinne against mee, and I shall forgiue him? Whereupon
<hi>Theophilact</hi> taking hold of this word <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra me,</hi> notes, That
if his brother should sinne against God, hee could hardly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue him. Saint
<hi>Luke</hi> deliuers the same much more plainly and cleerely, <hi>If thy
brother haue trespassed against thee, rebuke him; if hee repent, forgiue him:
If hee offend thee seuen times a day, and seuen times a day shall turne vnto
thee, forgiue him. Hugo Cardinalis</hi> hath obserued, That if the word <hi>In
te</hi> be the ablatiue case, then it is the same with <hi>Coram te</hi>: but
if it be the accusatiue, then it is all one with <hi>Contra te</hi>; and the
Greeke doth admit of no Ablatiues. In <hi>Leuiticus</hi> God had said long
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thy heart, but reprooue
him.</hi> And vpon a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond admonition, <hi>Take vnto thee two witnesses, and
tell it to the Church.</hi> Manle doe concur and runne along with this sence,
no difficultie in the world interposing it selfe.</p>
            <p>The second sence, which Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> also treateth of
in the same place, is, <hi>If he shall trespasse against thee,</hi> that is,
<hi>before thee.</hi> This opinion <hi>Thomas</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and the greater
and better part of the Schoolemen; howbeit there are great arguments and strong
reasons to the contrarie; and many graue Authours, to whom this sence doth not
seeme so plaine, as to ground thereupon any diuine precept. But leauing this to
the Schooles, the precept of brotherly correction concurreth with any
whatsoeuer heinous <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>For to prooue this truth, diuers Authors follow these two
paths:</p>
            <p>The one, That although our Sauior Christ in this his first
instance, speake of that sinne or trespasse which is committed against my
selfe; yet by a necessarie kind of consequence he inferreth likewise any sinne
that is committed against my Neighbour, and against God.</p>
            <p>Against my neighbour, because I ought to loue him as my selfe, and
to bee as sensible of his hurt as of myne owne.</p>
            <p>Against God, Because I am bound to pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> I not onely
pardon him, but that I also complie with the precept of brotherly correction;
how much more will he tie me, that I should deale

               </gap>his kind with my brother, hee
hauing <pb n="336" facs="tcp:22083:179"/> not sinned against me.</p>
            <p>The second part is, That this sinning or trespassing, whither it
be against my Neighbour, or against God, <hi>Thomas</hi> saith, That I knowing
it, it is done against me; because by scandalizing and proooking of me, it doth
hurt and offend me. And <hi>Hadrianus</hi> the Lawyer saith, That he that
sinnes against God, sinnes against any whatsoeuer faithfull beleeuer, and
leaues him iniured and offended. For he that wrongs the Father in the Sonnes
presence, wrongeth also the Sonne; and he that wrongeth the Master in the
presence of the Seruant, wrongeth likewise the Seruant: besides, Loue, which
makes things common, makes others iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ours. And if God take those
iniuries which are done to thee, to be done to himselfe, (as he said to Saint

&amp; of thy honor &amp; authoritie, seeing how the enemies of thy word slight

make vs sencible of the sins of our neighbor, for that they are members of this

               <hi>If thybrother shall trespasse against thee, &amp;c.</hi> The
verie name of a brother is a reason for this Precept: for it was condemned in
the Leuite and the Priest, That they passed by, saying their prayers to

Metropolis of Idumea, and her sinnes beeing come to the number of seuen, (which

               <hi>I will not turne to it.</hi> But suppose they were fewer, yet some of them
it should seem were verie foule ones; &amp; amongst the rest, this of their
vnsheathing of their sword against their brother. The Idumaeans were descended
of <hi>Esau,</hi> as the Iewes were of <hi>Iacob.</hi> And in the conquest of
the Land of Promise God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his People, That they should not doe that
hurt to the Idumaean, as they had done to the rest of the Nations; <hi>Quia
Frater tuus est, Hee is thy brother,</hi> and thou ougtest to procure his good
as thou wouldst thyne owne. This benefit, by the Idumaeans was repayed to Gods
People with a thousand iniuries, when the Philistines and those of Tyre
ouercame the Israelites; as you may read in the second of the
<hi>Chronicles</hi> and the second: For the Idumaeans did buy many Iews with
intent to make them their slaues. Likewise when Gods People had neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie
occasion (asking leaue of the Edomites) to passe through their Countrie in
peace, they withstood them with their swords in their hands. In a word, the
enmitie which <hi>Esay</hi> bare to <hi>Iacob</hi> for his messe of pottage,
&amp; the blessing that he had stolne from him, neither hee nor his posteritie
could euer yet digest it; though hee and his House had receiued many, and those
verie good courtesies at the others hands. And therefore it is not much, that
God should condemne an enmitie so antient, and so inueterated a hatred,
especially of one brother against anothe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

naturally inclining to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing of that hurt.</p>
            <p>Another naturall reason which your holy Fathers, learned Doctors,
and great Phylosophers render, is, That hee that can (if he will) hinder or put
by a hurt that is readie to fall vpon his brother, and doth it not, is
condemned to bee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe the hurter and harmer of him. Thy poore neighbor is
readie to starue and perish through hunger, thou beeing able to relieue, doost

            <p>Tell but a Blasphemer, a Drunkard, or any other lewd liuer, of his

swagger with you, and aske you, <hi>Who made you sir a Iustice of Peace? meddle

position wants no proofes.</p>
            <p>The necessarie circumstances of this precept are many:</p>
            <p>The first is, That the sinne which is to be corrected and

of this word, <hi>Si p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Ferrets or your Bloud-hounds, they go nosing and hunting after faults in other

into other mens faults, they doe not looke into their owne. And therefore thou
oughtest not to be so busie in reprehending what is amisse in thy brother, as
inquisitiue in correcting thyne owne errours. And therefore Saint

                  </gap> art thou that iudgest
another man?</hi> Hee treats there of those that iudge the secret intentions of
the heart, none but God hauing such iurisdiction ouer it. If thy brother fall
(saith he) his sinne is not layd to thy charge; and if hee rise againe, it is
not put to thy reckoning; he that now stands, may fall, and hee that is fallen
may rise againe. That man from whom we expect least, may be a Saint, and that
man from whom we expect most, may be a Sinner; for neither is our loue
cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, nor our feare secured. In <hi>Leuiticus</hi> God hath commanded,
That none <pb n="339" facs="tcp:22083:180"/> should serue in his Sanctuarie, or presse to
offer the bread of his God, hauing ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther too long or too short a nose, or a
nose that stood awrie. Where that nose is taken to be somewhat of the longest,
which goes nosing and senting after other mens liues and actions: and that of
the shortest, which quickely takes snuffe, and frets and fumes at the wagging
of a Feather: and that to bee crooked; which wrests things indifferent, and to
the worser part. And therefore God sayde by <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> That he would
cut off the noses and eares of his People,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ezech.</hi>
  23.</note> and lay his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation vpon them, and deale cruelly with them.</p>
            <p>The second circumstance is, That the sinne which wee find fault
withall, bee grieuous: for though light sinnes (as <hi>Origen</hi> hath noted
it) deserue correction, yet we haue not so precise an obligation for the
reproouing of them, as those that are more heinous. In this circumstance sute
your graue doctors &amp; your sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists: and Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> prooues
the same out of the words of the Text, <hi>Lucratus es fratrem tuum,</hi> Thou
hast woon thy brother. Now that is not said to be woon againe, which hath not
beene lost before; wee doe not giue a brother for lost for light sinnes, and
such as ordinarily accompanie our humane frailtie; but when his sins are so
notorious, that the Church doth proceed against them with Excommunications and
grieuous censures. And if men will hardly beare with small faults in their
brethren, God forbid but that they should haue an eye to those that are of a
higher nature. Likewise, hee that will correct another man, must be free
himselfe from that sinne which he reprooueth in another.<note place="margin">

               <hi>Who can say</hi> (saith <hi>Salomon</hi>) <hi>I haue made my

can so farre forth commend himselfe in this life, which is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall

thee,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.</note> when thou takest thy brother to
task, &amp; goest about to correct him, That thou consult and consider with thy
selfe, least thou thy selfe stand on the like termes, and art liable to the
same reproofe.</p>
            <p>The third circumstance is,<note place="margin">Old sores must not be
  rubbed vp.</note> When wee see our brother doth still perseuer and continue in
this his sinne. For, for a sinne alreadie past, and for the which there hath
beene a precedent sorrow and amendment, correction is no further neede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full;
for it being dismist Gods Court, and being blotted out of the book of his
remembrance, man ought not to enter a new Action against it. If hee will not
vouchsafe to heare thee, that is, obey thee, (for <hi>Audire</hi> and
<hi>Obedire</hi> is all one; <hi>In auditu auris, obediuit mihi</hi>) you may
doe as in Christian charitie you see cause, alwayes carrying a discreet hand in
the businesse. But if he shall forthwith hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vnto thee, and obey thy
instructions, thou must then forbeare to inflict any further punishment or
correction vpon him, than his owne contrition and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missiue obedience. Saint
<hi>Augustine</hi> tells vs, That the end of correction is, to put a bridle to
our sinnes, [<hi>In hamo &amp; fraeno maxillas eorum constringe, Put a bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
in their mouth, and a hooke in their nosthrils</hi>] and as to the Horse that
carrieth himselfe well and handsomely with one bridle, it is needlesse to clap
two; so that Sinner that will be ruled and gouerned with the bridle of the
feare of God, it is superfluous and more than needs, to check him with the curb
of correction.</p>
            <p>The fourth circumstance is, When wee haue some probable hope of
doing good vpon our brother. The Physition is not bound to cure that Patient of
whom there is no hope of recouerie; much lesse if hee feare greater hurt will
follow thereupon. And this feare or jealousie may bee occasioned two manner of
wayes.</p>
            <p>Either in regard of the hardnesse of heart, or obstinate condition
of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie that is to be corrected:</p>

               <pb n="340" facs="tcp:22083:181"/>Or in regard of the foolis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nesse of the partie correcting.</p>
            <p>For that it is a businesse that will require a great deale of

and angrie, that God should suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer his Ministers to be so much wronged: And
God appearing vnto him, though his zeale for the Lord God of Hosts was great,
yet because it had not its drammes of discretion to qualifie the eagrenesse
thereof, a mightie strong winde rent the mountaines and brake the rockes before
the Lord; after the winde came an earth-quake; and after the earth-quake, came
a fire; and after the fire, <pb n="341" facs="tcp:22083:181"/> came a still and soft voice.
And it is added in the Text, that the Lord was not in the winde, nor in the
earth-quake, nor in the fire, but in that still and soft voice.<note place="margin">Reprehension must be gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scretion.</note> Signifying
thereby, that he had the weapons of the windes, of earth-quakes, and of fire,
for to shake, ouerthrowe, and burne downe to the ground the tallest and
strongest towers and walles of his enemies; but withall, that he was of a sweet
nature, and that his vengeance was milde and gentle. There are some
corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions that teare vp the trees by the rootes, like a whirle-winde; that
shake and terrifie the Conscience, like an earth-quake; and that burne and
consume our honours to dust. But God is not in them. Hee that will correct
another (sayth Saint <hi>Paul</hi>) must consider what manner of Man himselfe
is. And that, as his brother hath sinned to day, so hee may sinne to morrow. To
day, thou findest thy brother guiltie, and to morrow it may so fall out, that
hee may come to bee thy Iudge. It is fit (sayth <hi>Petrus Crysologus</hi>)
that there should bee correction, to serue as a bridle to those that are
headstrong; but withall, That as a loose rayne does no good, so too hard a hand
may doe hurt. <hi>Lucian</hi> sayth, That our hart is a white, or marke whereat
shafts be shot: Whereof some are deliuered with that force and strength of the
arme, that passing quite through, they doe it much hurt; others againe with so
slacke a string, and that weakenesse, that falling short of the marke, they doe
no good at all. Wee must draw them therefore with that cunning, and with so
daintie a deliuerie, that wee may sticke iust in the white, and hit the right
marke. That <hi>Arque, obsecra, increpa,</hi> of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> argues a
quicke and nimble deliuerie. And that of <hi>Ouid, Precibusque minis regaliter

sharpe and bitter. Whereunto hee answered, How shall the mouth that is
distasted, eate that which is not seasoned with salt? Or what appetite will a
sicke and weake stomach haue to an egge, or a chicken that is not boyled with
salt? Yet farre more vnsauoury than either of these is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discreet reproofe,
and words out of season. The Seuentie translate it, <hi>Who can eat bread
without salt, or suffer imprudent correction?</hi> And as distast in our meats
may arise from too much or too little salt; so correction may haue so little
salt in it, that it may make the Sicke to dislike it, and refuse io eat it; and
on the other side, it may haue so much, that he will not be able to swallow it.
What good can hee doe, who in his correction doth discouer the passion and
hatred of one that is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, the imperiousnesse of a proud spirit, the
taunting checkes of a rayling tongue, and the intemperate ioy of an enuious

               <p>This condition taken in the first sence <hi>de iniuria

               <p>In the second sence, touching the sinning against our Neighbour
  and against God, this seemeth to some somewhat too hard a course; for the sinne
  beeing secret, the partie reprehended before two witnesses, may replie and say
  vnto me, That I lie, that there is no such matter, that I defame him and call
  his name in question, and complaining of me to the Iustice, he may prooue the
  defamation vpon mee, but I not prooue the delict vpon him. Saint
  <hi>Hierome</hi> saith, That these two witnesses ought likewise to bee his
  reproouers, and to put to their helping hand to raise him that is fallen: who
  cannot be Correctors of him, the sinne not appearing, in regard it is secret.
  Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> likewise saith, That he that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recteth a man must
  take one or two witnesses vnto him, that the correction may be the more
  effectuall, and the more substantiall. For, <hi>By the mouth of two or three
  euery word is confirmed,</hi> (so saith the Law) <hi>Id est, in testimonio vel

               <p>For this inconuenience sake, some say, That before I correct my
  brother the second time, I should make one or two witnesses acquainted with his
  fault, that they may ioyne with me in the correcting of him, and to the end
  that the corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction may be the grauer and the more effectuall. And to him that
  shall replie, How can I reueale that sinne which in it selfe is secret? They
  answer, That it is a lesse ill, that two or three should know of it, and that
  by them he should rather suffer losse in his fame, than in his soule.</p>
               <p>Against these two witnesses we haue the authoritie of Saint
  <hi>Augustine,</hi> who willeth, That if any religious person shall commit any
  notorious sinne, or other scandalous action to his calling, thou shalt first

  as it is in the hiding of a wound in the bodie from the eye of the Surgeon.

               <p>Against this Truth there is a great argument grounded out of the

                  <hi>And if he wil not vouchsafe to heare thee, tell it vnto the

  <hi>Chrysostome</hi> and Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> expound it. Nor doth our
  Sauiour Christ here treat of the secular Iudge, nor secular Lawes, but those
  that are Ecclesiasticall. And therefore he saith, <hi>Dic Ecclesiae, Tell it to

  from his brothers brest and eyes, How shall he hope to draw water out of a
  rocke or a stone? There is a great deale of controuersie and much adoo touching
  that sin of <hi>Moses,</hi> for which God denied him entrance into the holy
  Land: S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, That it was incredulitie. The opinion of the
  Hebrewes is, That this his sinne was, his not speaking to the Rocke. God spake
  vnto these two brothers, and said, <hi>Loquimini ad Petram</hi>; which
  <hi>Moses</hi> strooke once or twice with his Rod, &amp;c. Now if two words
  would haue beene sufficient for to draw water out of a rocke, Is it much that
  Man should draw it out of the heart (though it were made of stone) and conuey
  it, as by a Conduit, to the eyes? <hi>Salomon</hi> saith, That many do excuse
  themselues of fulfilling Gods commandements, alledging their want of strength
  and abilitie; That it stands not with their health, to fast on halfe
  holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes, nor to eat Fish in Lent, or on Frydayes [<hi>Vires non
  suppetunt.</hi>] Hereunto I make a twofold answer:</p>
               <p>The one, <hi>Deus est Inspector cordis,</hi> It is God that

  a false Dye, thou maist cozen thy Physition with a lye, but thou canst not
  cozen God.</p>
               <p>The other, <hi>Ipse intelligit</hi>; God knowes well enough,
  That thou canst not doe any good thing without his helpe, for hee must assist
  thee with his grace in this life, and with glorie in the life to come, <hi>And
  will reward euerie man according to his workes. Leo</hi> the Pope saith, That
  hee that thinkes with himselfe, that it is a hard thing to be corrected<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
  must haue recourse to Gods mercie, &amp; to intreat his fauour that he will
  free him from this his euill custome, and so to humble him, that correction may
  seeme sweet vnto him.</p>
               <p>Lastly, Albeit at first the partie reprooued will shew himselfe
  harsh &amp; soure vnto thee, yet vpon better consideration hee will con thee
  thankes, and like bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of thy plaine dealing with him, than if thou hadst
  soothed vp his sinnes; <hi>He that reprooues a man shall afterward find more
  grace than hee that deceiues him with a flattring tongue.</hi> To S.
  <hi>Austen,</hi> the corrections &amp; admonitions of his mother were
  vnsauorie; but afterwards he confessed, That he was much more beholding to her
  for hauing reduced him to the right way, than for bringing him forth into the
  world. <hi>Who is it that maketh me glad,</hi> (saith Saint <hi>Paul) but he

  The Scripture is full of rewards and of threatnings, both in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour 
  <pb n="348" facs="tcp:22083:186"/> and disfauour of the Corrector and the Corrected. Of him
  that correcteth <hi>Crysostome</hi> saith, <hi>If thou shouldest giue
  innumerable riches to the Poore, thou shalt not worke that good thereby, as
  thou shalt by sauing a soule</hi>; for there is no price compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with that
  of the Soule: <hi>Fructus justi, lignum vitae,</hi> By liuing well himselfe,
  and by gaining his brothers Soule. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, That euerie
  Christian should desire that all should be saued; and he that contemneth
  correction, doth in part denie this desire. And the Apostle Saint
  <hi>Iames,</hi> That he that shall conuert his brother, and remooue him from
  his errour, <hi>shall saue his soule from death</hi>: In which words are
  comprised as well his owne, as anothers soule. <hi>Thomas</hi> saith,
  Correction is <hi>eleemosina spiritualis, a spirituall kind of almes</hi>; and
  of so much more price than any other alms, by how much the soule is of more
  price than the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, &amp; by how much the goods of Grace are to be preferred
  before those of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune and of Nature. He that succours the Poore, when hee
  giues most, hee can but lay downe his corporall life for him; but hee that
  raiseth vp him that is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, bestowes a spirituall life on him, and
  performes the office of an Apostle. So that to correct and
  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o be corrected, brings with it so
  much interest, and so much gaine, that euery man may account it for a great
  happinesse.</p>
               <p>The incorrigible man is so threatned in the sacred Scripture,
  that the verie feare thereof is able to quell his spirits,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Prou.</hi> 29.</note> and to make him turne Coward. <hi>A man
  that hardneth his necke when he is rebuked, shall suddenly be destroyed,</hi>
  so saith <hi>Salomon</hi>: The Hebrew phrase is, <hi>Vir correctionum,</hi> he
  that liueth so ill, that a man had need to carrie alwayes in his hand a rod of
  correction for him; and instead of amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his faults, dayly addes sinne vnto
  sinne, whereby hee is ouertaken with sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den death, which in a Sinner is of all
  other euils the greatest. Other lesser threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings are set downe by
  <hi>Salomon, Pouertie and shame shall be to him that forsaketh
  dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline:</hi> and now here he saith, <hi>Sudden destruction shall come vpon
  him.</hi> So long may hee perseuer in the hardnesse of his heart, that Gods
  justice may ouertake him, and shorten his dayes by sudden death. The truth of
  this is apparent in <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh,</hi> to whom so many faire warnings and
  admonitions serued but to make the heape of his sinnes the higher, till at
  last, with those heapes of waters hee was ouerwhelmed suddenly in the sea. It
  is written in the Booke of <hi>Wisedome,</hi> That those cruell and many

  that those whom the plagues which God had sent among them (as so many
  admonitions &amp; so many warnings) had not made an end of, sudden death might
  destroy, and supplie the defect of that punishment. O, that Sinners would bee
  so wise as to enter into discourse with themselues. The Adulterer, whom God
  hath freed from a thousand noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious dangers of his life and credit; though
  his brethren haue not checkt him, yet hath his owne conscience corrected him
  with greater seueritie, and far more <pb n="349" facs="tcp:22083:186"/> sharpely; as also
  the sudden death of other his fellow Adulterers. A sudden stab takes him out of

  The end is the foundation of all our actions,</hi> and the gaining of a lost
  brother is the end and scope of these our diligences. Where I would haue you to
  note, That hee that doth a wrong, doth euer receiue more hurt than he that hath
  the wrong; <hi>Qui alterum ladit, plus sibi nocet, Hee that hurts another, doth
  most hurt to himselfe</hi>; for the hurt that the wronged receiueth, is
  outwardly, and in bodie; but the hurt of him that wrongeth is inwardly, and in
  soule. And therefore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Yee that sinne against your
  brother, sin against Christ; he that despiseth these things, despiseth not man,
  but God.</hi> And our Sauiour Christ, <hi>He that shall call his brother Foole,
  is worthie of Hell fire</hi>: So that the wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged cannot receiue the third
  part of the harme of the partie wronging. <hi>Plato</hi> is of opinion, That
  hee that doth an iniurie to another, doth the greatest to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe; and cannot
  (if he would) studie to doe himselfe a worse mischiefe. <hi>Dauid</hi> was much
  wronged by <hi>Absolon,</hi> (for what greater offence could a sonne commit,
  than to rise vp in rebellion against his owne father?) but hee considering with
  himselfe, That his sonne had done himselfe the greater hurt, called out vnto
  the men of Warre, and said vnto them, <hi>Seruate mihi puerum Absalon, Spare my
  son Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salon, and see you doe not slay him.</hi> And therefore our Sauiour
  Christ teacheth vs this Lesson, If thy brother receiue the greater hurt of the
  two by the wrong and iniurie that he doth thee, doe not goe about to bee
  reuenged of him, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther take pittie and compassion of him; as thou wouldst
  be grieued for him, who thinking to giue thee a wound, should put a stoccado
  vpon himself, &amp; die in the place. Reprooue therefore thy brother, and if he
  shal hearken vnto thee, <hi>Lucra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus es fratrem tuum.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Thou hast gained thy brother.</hi> God hath a great desire,
  that thou shouldst win thy brother to thee, &amp; gain his soule. To this

  great care which God taketh in seeking after a Sinner, and the desire that he
  hath to reduce him to his obedience. To the like end did he propose that other
  Parable of the prodigall Child; whose argument ends in the great ioy wherewith
  his father welcommed him home, after hee had giuen him for lost. And heere in
  this place hee wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

  that God when hee cannot worke vs for Heauen by faire and gentle persuasions,
  by loue and intreaties, then will hee vse blows &amp; stripes, &amp; beats vs

published, but the many miracles which our Sauiour wrought in the Land of
Galilee: for there was not that sicke bodie, if he could but come to touch his

cut the wings of his fame a little shorter, and disgrace and discredit him in

  so much, they should now make such a doo about that which did import them so
  little. The rarest and greatest accident that the World euer saw, was Christs
  comming into the World. The Iewes did earnestly desire it, and beg it so
  instantly at Gods hands, that it was the verie marke and white whereat the

  this his comming was blowne abroad, trumpetted farre and neere by the Kings of

  death of those innocent Babes; the supreame Councell sent some of their Leuites
  to <hi>Iohn Baptist, To demand of him, What art thou?</hi> For they standing
  much vpon their authoritie and greatnes, they would not stirre one foot out of
  doores themselues: but heere now they come in person from Hierusalem to
  Galilee, vpon so sleight an occasion as the washing or not washing of the
  hands, making much adoo about a matter of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. In ordinarie businesses we
  will trust our seruants, sending one this way, and another that way; but in

  Amongst other innumerable differences of the just man and the Sinner, foure fit
  well for our present purpose.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">(1.)</note>The first is, That the just hath
  no eyes saue to looke vpon his owne sinnes; and the Sinner hath not any saue
  onely to prie into other mens faults. The Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians had an eye, and that a
  strict one too, ouer the Children of Israell; but so had not the Israelites
  ouer the Aegyptians: And the Booke of <hi>Wisedome</hi> ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring the reason
  thereof, saith, <hi>Onely vpon them there fell a heauie night, but thy Saints

                  </gap> stolne from his subiect,
  but had neuer an eye to look out to behold his owne robbing of another man both
  of his wife and his life. Our Sauiour Christ said of the Pharisees, That they
  could spie a moat in another mans eyes, but not see the beame that was in their
  owne. <hi>Dauid,</hi> though he were in grace and fauour with God, yet did his
  sins so trouble him, that he thought no man was so great a Sinner as himselfe:
  Which made him to crie out, <hi>Peccatum meum contrame est</hi>; and anon after
  to come vpon his knees vnto God,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Psal.</hi>

                     </gap> God, according to thy
  louing kindnesse, and according to the multitude of thy mercies blot out my
  transgressions.</hi> Here he embarkes all the mercies of God, hee makes a stop
  and stay of them, he arrests them, that they may not goe from him, hauing so
  great need of them as he had. So must thou, and I, and all of vs, desire &amp;
  beg the like at Gods hand; and to thinke with our selues, that no mans sinnes
  in the world are more or greater than ours.</p>
               <p>The second is grounded vpon a certaine kind of language &amp;
  phrase of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,<note place="margin">The godly looke careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to their
 wayes.</note> which saith, That he that feareth God will looke wel vnto his
  wayes, haue an eye to his actions, and throughly examine his owne conscience:
  <hi>Qui timet Deum, conuertetur ad corsuum</hi>; but he that doth not feare
  God, minds none of all these. And of this mind is <hi>Petrus Chrysologus,</hi>
  treating of the Prodigall, <hi>Abij<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

  journey of his (saith he) was farther off in point of his vnderstanding, than

                  </gap> full of trouble and
  vexation. A man that is much imployed, and full of businesse, his ordinarie
  phrase is, <hi>No tengo bora mia, I am not myne owne man, no not for an
  houre;</hi> I am so taken vp with busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, that I am made as it were a slaue
  and drudge vnto them. <hi>Salomon</hi> called those, Euill dayes, which were
  spent in searching into other mens liues, in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Histories, and other
  worldly actions which doe little or nothing at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne vs. The Apostle
  would haue vs to redeeme them; Redeeme those thou hast sould and mis-spent;
  <hi>for many were with me.</hi> Thy Angells did guard me. And amongst those
  many that had not an eye vnto their wayes, I had alwaies a care to looke vnto
  my steps.</p>
               <p>The third is, That the Sinner lookes vpon the just,<note n="(3.)" place="margin">The godly make vse of the Sinner for their owne good, so
 doth not he of them <hi>Prou.</hi> 25.</note> as on the Attorney that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuseth

  af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts him; <hi>The Sinner doth behold the Iust with attention, and seakes
  to take his life from him,</hi> because in looking vpon him he beholds his owne
  condemnation. The Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant troubles that water which represents his owne
  foulenesse vnto him: And the Ape breaks that glasse wherein he sees his own
  ilfauoured face. <hi>A righteous man falling downe before the Wicked, is like a
  troubled Well, and a corrupt Spring.</hi> But the just man lookes vpon a
  Sinner, as vpon a wand that beats the dust out of him; as Gods Hangman, or the
  Instrument to execute his will. So King <hi>Dauid</hi> looked vpon
  <hi>Shimei</hi> when he cursed him; so Gods People vpon <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and
  <hi>Nebucadne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi>; so the Prophet, on the Lyon which took his life from
  him on the way. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> compares the Sinner to a Milstone and
  a Winepresse; the one clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the Oyle, the other purgeth the Wine. <hi>But
  it is not so with the Wicked, for they are like dust that are scattered before
  the face of the wind</hi>: The Hebrew renders it, Like a Measure that leuels
  out a thing to it's iust bredth and length, &amp; defends it from colds and
  heats. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> expounding that place of <hi>Genesis, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor

  did serue him, being that he was alwayes an enemie vnto him? And his answer is,
  That hee did serue him euen in his forsaking of him and his persecuting of
  him.</p>
               <p>The fourth and last difference is,<note n="(4.)" place="margin">The wicked like the fly will be all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies sucking as

  Iust; the Sinner will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haue an eye to see them, nor a tongue to praise
  them; but to find out the least moat or atome of ill, he is Eagle-eyed. And
  like vnto the Vulture, ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flying the pleasant fields, and passing by the
  sweet smelling pastures, pitches vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the blade bone of an Asse, or the

  bodie, and that a faire one too, to light vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, makes choice to fall vpon no

  and gybe at her, saying, That for a Queene shee was somewhat of the blackest.
  Whereunto she answered, That indeed she was blacke, yet faire withall.
  <hi>Aaron</hi> and his sister <hi>Mirian</hi> murmured against <hi>Moses,
  Because hee had taken an Aethyopian to wife</hi>: Is it not a fine thing, (said
  they) that a Gouernor of so many Soules, a Ruler and Commander ouer Gods
  People, should marrie with a Blackamoore? The Rule which we are to obserue, is
  matter of Vertue; let vs fixe our eys vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on other folkes vertues, and turne
  them aside from those good gifts which are in our selues, <hi>Aemulamini

               <p>
                  <hi>Why doe not thy Disciples wash their hands?</hi> The seeing

  such a mans sonne bee a Theefe, they doe not therefore hate their owne
  children. But if a Minister doe amisse, or a Churchman commit such or such a

  so wronged his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, that it seemeth he desired but some good occasion to

  change my condition; O, that I could of a Rose become a Thorne. <hi>Moses</hi>
  his Rod was turned into a Serpent, and such a Serpent, that it deuoured those

  seeme to bee, there lay a great deale of malice hidden vnder it, and a great
  deale of enuie. Other vices haue much of the Deuils venome in them, but none of
  them so much as Enuie. There was a great deale of enuie couered vnder those
  words, when the little childeren cried to <hi>Elisha, Baldpate, bald pate</hi>;
  whereupon the Beares came downe amongst them from the mountaines, and tore

  Baldpate. And <hi>Iustine Martyr</hi> farther discouereth this their malice,
  and saith, That some of the Iewes were of opinion, That the Deuill had dasht
  <hi>Elias</hi> in pieces on the top of some high mountaine; and that these
  childrens meaning was, when they cried, <hi>Come vp thou Baldpate,</hi> that
  the Deuill would doe the like by him. This their malice was likewise holpen on
  by their Parents, who read this Lecture to their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. And fit it was that
  Beares should be their Executioners; for a Beare being at his birth an vnshapen
  lumpe of flesh, the Dam thereof by licking of it brings it's eyes, mouth, and
  nose into a forme. In like manner, the parents of these chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren had shaped
  them according to their owne mind, and informed them what they should say. In a
  word, These Scribes and Pharisees finding fault with the Disciples not washing
  of their hands, taxeth maliciously the vncleannesse of their hearts; and from
  that little sanctitie that they would inforce vpon his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, they would
  faine infer, That their Master had but little holinesse in him; Wherein they

               <p>Besides, There are some things which in Noblemen and Gentlemen
  are but toyes and trifles to speake of, which in those that professe a state of
  more perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, are grieuous crimes. A young Gallant rounds the streets at

  her eares with musicke, and this in him is not held any disgrace at all; but a
  graue Churchman, an old Deane, or a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non doth the like, this in him is a
  foule fault, and esteemed to be a heinous sinne. <hi>Dauid</hi> was a man of
  great strength; <hi>Sampson</hi> stronger than hee; cut off <hi>Dauids</hi>
  haire, and you abate not one iot of his strength; but cut off
  <hi>Sampsons,</hi> &amp; he grows as weake as water, and yee may do what yee
  will with him, because his strength was in his haire.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> saith in an Epistle of his to
  <hi>Demetriades,</hi>
                  <note n="(3.)" place="margin">'Tis base in any, to seeke his
 owne cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, by the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> That nothing doth more
  discouer the basenesse of mans mind, and the vnworthinesse of his disposition,
  as to seeke to credit himselfe by discrediting of others, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
  estimation not by the good in himselfe, but the ill in others; and comparing
  themselues with men of meane deserts, seeke to shine through others darknesse.
  <hi>Esay</hi> likens the heart of an ill natur'd man, to a troublesome and
  tempestuous sea, which seeking to cleanse it selfe,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Esay</hi> 57.</note> casts all it's filth vpon those shores
  which are next to it. The proud Pharisee kneeling before the Alter, boasted
  himselfe say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>I am not as other men</hi>; these men are theeues, I am
  not so; these men are couetous, I am not so, &amp;c. In your ballances, the one
  cannot come vp vnlesse the other come downe; the Moone giues not her light till
  the Sunne hides his head.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 18,</note> In a word,
  It is the manner of some men to rise by other mens falling, and to grace
  themselues by disgracing others. <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Magi could increase euils;
  <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> caused Frogs, and they caused Frogs; <hi>Moses,</hi> Flies, and
  they Flies: but they could not lessen nor stop euills; bid them take away those
  plagues, they could not doe it. So there are some men, all whose worth and
  power consists in adding euills to euills, but not in taking them away. But God
  runnes a contrarie course, he alwayes doth good, but neuer does that is il:
  <hi>Sicut malum inter ligna syluarum,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Some delight in
 nothing but doing euill.</note> He is a Pippen among Thorns, he inuites vs with
  his Fruit; they scratch &amp; teare our flesh. And albeit the washing of the
  hands was a verie light fault, yet one little and another little comes in the
  end to make a mickle. His Disciples doe not wash their hands, they doe not fast
  with <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> their master keepes companie with Publicans and
  sinners, he obserues not their Fasts, he hath made a compact with
  <hi>Belzeebub, Non est à Deo, He is not of God.</hi> See what a
  mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious conclusion they make of these premisses.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, It is a hatefull thing to God, That a man should
  commend Vice, and condemne Vertue; <hi>Hee that iustifies the Wicked, and
  condemneth the lust,</hi>
                  <note n="(4.)" place="margin">The wicked are wholy giuen
 to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne Vertue and commend Vice. <hi>Esay</hi> 5.20.23.</note> 
                  <hi>both
  are an abhomination to the Lord. Esay</hi> repeateth the same lesson in the
  fifth Chapter of his Prophecie, <hi>Woe vnto them that speake good of euill,
  and euill of good; that iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the wicked, and take away the righteousnesse
  of the righteous from him.</hi> And for the better qualifying of the greatnesse
  and heinousnesse of this fault, in one place the Scripture cals it abhominable;
  and in another, bewailes it with a <hi>Vae,</hi> or Wo; which (as Saint
  <hi>Gregorie</hi> hath noted it) is commonly athreatning of a perdurable
  punishment. And therefore <hi>Esay</hi> farther addeth, <hi>As the flame of
  fire deuoureth the stubble, and as the chaffe is consumed of the flame, so
  their root shall be as rottennesse, and their bud shall rise vp like
  dust.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fiftly, Our Sauiour returnes the point of this weapon vpon their
  owne bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somes, by comming vpon them with a <hi>Quare &amp; vos,</hi> conuincing
  (as Saint <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> saith) this their slander, with a truth.<note n="(5.)" place="margin">He that would reproue an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, must<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> first

  when the Pharisees askt him, If they should stone her or no to death, according
  as the Law commanded: whereunto he answered, <hi>Let him that is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out sinne

  <pb n="358" facs="tcp:22083:191"/> (nature so holding it fit) to the end they might the
  better receiue and discerne all other colours. In like manner, he that will
  reprehend other mens faults must himselfe be blamelesse. <hi>Dauids</hi> sinne
  was knowne to all the world, yet he made confession thereof onely vnto God,
  <hi>Against thee onely haue I sinned, &amp;c.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God onely had the
  power to punish him. For he onely (saith Saint <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi>) doth iustly
  punish, in whome there is not any thing to be found that deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
  punishment;<note place="margin">The punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of sinne belongs onely vnto
 God.</note> and that man is fit to reprehend another, in whom nothing is to bee
  found worthie reprehension. Those of Israell sallyed twice out against those of
  Beniamin, desiring justice at Gods hands of that cruell sinne which they had
  committed, but were both times ouercome. Saint <hi>Gregorie</hi> saith, That
  they went forth against them to reuenge Gods honour, and the wrong that was
  done to their Neighbour; but God did not giue them the victorie, because they
  had an Idoll amongst them which they adored. Now hee that will punish another
  mans sinnes, must first purge himselfe of his owne sinnes.</p>
               <p>The representing of mans owne sinnes to himselfe, is a great
  <hi>Tapaboca,</hi> or stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>game, to play vpon other mens faults. To that Sinner
  who vseth to cast his sins like a wallet ouer his shoulder, God saith,
  <hi>Statuam contra te faciem tuam,</hi> I will make thee to see that which thou
  doost not see, and I will bring those sinnes which thou hast throwne behind thy
  backe, before thy face, to the end that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ashamed of thyne owne doings,

                  <hi>Woe is me, I am vndone</hi> (saith
  <hi>Esay</hi>) <hi>because I am a man of polluted lips.</hi> The Prophet had
  seene God in a Throne of great and wonderfull Maiestie, and hee would haue
  published and proclaimed the same to all the World, but hee sayth That he durst
  not presume to do it, because his lips were polluted. The Chaldae word is,
  <hi>Grauis ore,</hi> My lips are of too heauie a dulnesse for such high
  Misteries. The seuentie Interpreters render it, <hi>Vae mihi, doleo
  compunctus,</hi> My sinnes stop my mouth, when I consider myne owne life, I

  of many grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous sinnes, he left him amased and ashamed. God tooke away the
  poore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent babe which <hi>Dauid</hi> had by <hi>Beersheba,</hi> pretending
  therein (according to <hi>Theodoret</hi>) to burie this his sinne vnder ground,
  because he beeing appointed by God to punish Adultrers &amp; Murdrers, they
  might not tit him in the teeth &amp; say vnto him,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.5.</note> 
                  <hi>And why doe you the like?</hi> Saint
  <hi>Paul</hi> askes the question, <hi>Is God then vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iust?</hi> And he answers
  thereunto, <hi>God forbid, else, How shall God iudge the world?</hi> If thou
  shouldest aske a Phylosopher, Whither it were possible for God to sinne? He
  would answer, It is not possible, because he is <hi>Causa prima, &amp; norma
  vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salis, The prime cause, and vniuersall rule.</hi> But Saint
  <hi>Pauls</hi> answer is, That it is not possible that God should sinne,
  because he could not then conueniently gouerne the world. For he can hardly
  reforme sinne in another man, who had need to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme what is amisse in
  himselfe. Three Kings did conspire against the king of Moab,<note place="margin">4. <hi>Kings</hi> 3.</note> they besieged his Citie, and he seeing
  himselfe in a desperate taking, <hi>tooke his eldest sonne that should haue
  raigned in his stead, and offered him for a burnt offering vpon the wall.
  Cajetan</hi> saith, That this Sacrifice was not done to the God of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell, as
  some haue imagined, but to those Idols which that King did worship; and that
  after this so cruell an act, there insued so great a plague in the Israelites
  Campe, that they were forced to raise the siege. <hi>Facta est indignatio magna
  in Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</hi> The Hebrew hath it, <hi>Ira magna</hi>: The Vulgar renders it,
  Israel was sore grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and departed from him, and returned to their

  sacrificed their sonnes &amp; daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters <pb n="359" facs="tcp:22083:191"/> to Deuils,
  according to that of <hi>Dauid, Sacrificauerunt filios &amp; filias suas
  dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monio.</hi> By whose example the King of Moab learned to offer this kind of
  sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; and God was highly offended with them for it, and therefore would
  not suffer such as had playd the Idolaters in sacrificing their children, to
  take away the Kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of other Idolaters, who perhaps were lesse faulty than
  themselues. <hi>Alexander</hi> layingit to a Pyrats charge, that with two ships
  he had robbed at sea; hee returned him this answere, Thou rob'st all the World,
  and no man sayes any thing vnto thee; and I, who to picke out a poore liuing,
  put foorth to sea but with two poore little barkes, must haue theft and pyracie
  layd to my charge. The like answere did a Bishop make to Pope <hi>Gregorie</hi>
  the second, when hee kept his Sea at Auignon, Who giuing him a shrewd checke,
  for that he did not reside in his Bishopricke; he told him, It is now full
  three score and ten yeares that the Popes Sea hath beene kept out of Rome, and
  your Holinesse now reprehends me for liuing but three dayes from my
  Bishopricke. To this purpose sutes that answere which <hi>Vriah</hi> gaue to

  the ease and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of his owne bed? He made him this answere, The Arke of
  God dwelleth in Tents, and my Lord <hi>Ioab</hi> Generall of your Army, and the
  seruants of my lord abide in the open fields; shall I then beeing but an
  ordinarie souldier, goe into my house to eate, and drinke, and lye with my
  wife? By thy life, and by the life of thy soule, I will not doe this thing.
  This was a seuere reprehension in <hi>Vriah,</hi> to his soueraigne. For if a
  subiect shall out of such honest respects refraine from going home to his owne
  house; much more ought the King to haue abstained from lying with another mans
  wife. Nor is that Historie of <hi>Iudas</hi> much amisse, who being Gouernor of
  the people, and finding <hi>Thamar</hi> great with child, would needs execute

               <p>Now wee come to the last reason of this our Sauiours sharpe and
  quicke an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere vnto them. There were two Truths prophecied of our Sauiour
  Christ:</p>
               <p>The one, his Meekenesse and Gentlenesse. And of this,<note place="margin">Christ
 as he was meeke in reproouing, so he was stout in reuenging.</note> there are
  many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies.</p>
               <p>The other, The stoutnesse and courage wherewith he was to
  reuenge the wrongs and iniuries done to the poore. <hi>Saluos faciet filios
  pauperum &amp; humiliabit calumniatorem, He shall saue the children of the
  poore, and shall humble the slanderer.</hi> Saint <hi>Austen, Iustin</hi>
  Martyr, and many others, vnderstand this to be spoken litte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally of Christ.
  For <hi>Calumniatorem,</hi> the Greeke reades <hi>Sycophantam.</hi> And so doe
  they call your Promooters and Informers. Whether it were, because in Athens
  they had a Law, that none should bring figges to that Citie to sell; Or whether
  it was forbidden in Greece, that any should enter to gather figs in another
  mans orchard; (Whence he that informed thereof, came to bee called a Sycophant)
  Or vpon that wittie conceit of <hi>Aesops,</hi> who, when a certaine seruant
  had eaten some figges<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and layd the fault vpon one of his fellowes, gaue
  order, that both of them should drinke luke-warme water, and the eater of them,
  hauing vomited vp the figges<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they called him Sycophant. Our Sauior then
  shal saue the poore, and humble the slanderer. <hi>Hee shall smite the earth
  with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lippes shall he slay the
  wicked.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>Iraeneus</hi>
  expoundeth this place to be spoken of Gods protecting and defending of the
  poore. He is their tower of defence in the day of trouble, their hope in
  distresse, and their shield of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in their tribulation. And that God doth
  reuenge with greater seueritie, the <pb n="360" facs="tcp:22083:192"/> wrongs that are done
  to his friends, than those that are offered to himself, is a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor so vsually
  with him, and so generally known, that I need not to insist therup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. One
  while, because hee thinkes himselfe much beholding vnto them, that they wil
  resigne vp their owne right, and leaue the cause of their wrongs to him; and
  that they will put their hope, and their trust in him. <hi>Sub vmbra alarum
  tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arum sperabo, donec transeat iniquitas,</hi> i. <hi>Calamitas.</hi> Defend
  mee ô Lord, whilest this storme passeth ouer my head. Another while, that
  he may shew more loue to his friends than to himselfe. In the old Law, hee gaue
  great proofes of this Truth; and in the new, hee gaue farre greater testimonies
  thereof. <hi>Esay</hi> drawes a comparison from the Lyon, who hauing his prey
  betweene his clawes, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie of Sheapeheards come crying after him, making
  a great noyse and clamor, but he makes no great reckoning of it. And is all one
  with that saying of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uior, <hi>Non rapiet quisquam de manu mea, No man

  there are, wherein the opinion of the world can doe more than the faith of God.
  Your great Lords will impawne their estate to maintaine a Tilting or a
  Tournying, or in making a Maske for to doe their Mistresse seruice; They will
  bee liberall and bountifull to a common Buffoon, or Iester, but will scarce
  giue a royall to the poore. And this is Tradition. <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apostata
  made a Proclamation, that no Christian should inioy your <hi>Militarie
  ornaments;</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tooke this for such an affront, that they who before
  would haue fried at the Stake for God, did denie him for worldly respects, and
  for the preseruing of <pb n="366" facs="tcp:22083:195"/> their honour. Gentlemen, not
  measuring their expences by their meanes, it so fals out, that oftentimes they
  want a royall to buy bread to put in their mouths, yet their vanitie so farre
  ouerswaies them, that they will not be without a coach, a lackey, a page, an
  old beldame, and a squire. They take vp commodities at deere rates, they run in
  debt, neuer thinke of paying it, and in the end are vtterly vndone; this also
  is Tradition. Your Captaines and Souldiers stand much vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Lawes of your
  Duell, and highly adore them; which beeing well exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, are the greatest
  &amp; absurdest fooleries man can imagine? The Lye, must haue the bastonadoe;
  the bastonado, drawing of bloud; and drawing of bloud, death, &amp;c. One shall
  strike thee with a cudgell, that shall breake thy shoulder-blade; And the
  Souldier will say, He had good hap that hee did not lame him with a cane. And
  this is Tradition. Your hucking Merchants, your cunning Tradesmen, &amp;
  generally all that buy and sell, vse to cog &amp; lye: <hi>It is not good, it
  is not good, sayes euery buyer,</hi> And this too is Tradition. Your
  Catch-poles, pole their prisoners;<note place="margin">Tradition the Churches

  Saint <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi> sayth, That the Churches perdition hath beene, that
  Christians are not contented with sinning through weakenesse, through
  ignorance, or through ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, but through opinion; whence it commeth to passe,
  that they seeke not excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses for their sinnes, but authoritie to maintaine
  them, thereby the better to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuate them. They that are condemned through
  error, are easily cured; but when they haue opinion in their fauour, and a
  generall consent, and are authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by custome, they are such currant money
  that none refuses it, nor seekes to remedie the same. <hi>Insanientium
  multitudo</hi> (sayth <hi>Seneca</hi>) <hi>fit sanitatis protectio, The
  madnesse of many, doth priuiledge madnesse.</hi> This passeth in these foresayd
  Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. And so are they receiued of all, &amp;c. They sayd vnto
  <hi>Micheas, All the Prophets with one generall consent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> prophecie good
  vnto the King.</hi> But how doe they deliuer this message well, if God doe
  reueale it to be ill? It is Tradition. But the Law of God, ought to bee the
  rule whereby wee are to leuell our actions, and the court wherein wee are to
  giue account of our doings. <hi>Tertullian</hi> sayth, That our Sauior
  Christ,<note place="margin">Chist not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Custome, but Truth.</note> was not
  called Custome, but Truth. <hi>Ego sum via, verit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

  Antiquitie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For God hath commaunded, saying, Honour thy Father and
  Mother,</hi> and he that doth the contrarie let him dye; But yee say, Though he
  honour not his Father or his Mother, he shall be free: Thus haue ye made the
  commandements of God of no authoritie by your Traditions. In this honouring of
  our Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he likewise includes their maintainance, and that wee
  should not see them want. But ye say, That he that shall take from Father and
  Mother and giue it to the Temple, doth comply with the Law. <hi>Munus

  thee, but it is better to giue it vnto God. <hi>Origen</hi> saith, That this
  errour did arise from another that was more antient. For when men were not
  willing to pay a debt, they did offer it to the Temple, and did noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the
  same to the Creditor. <hi>Corban, id est, donum est,</hi> I haue giuen it to
  the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and therefore thou art not to require it at my hands. This was a
  rauening kind of couetousnesse. God would haue bread set vpon his altar, to the
  end that he that was in necessitie might be releeued;<note place="margin">Our
 offrings are no honor to God, when they harme another.</note> which was
  <hi>Dauids</hi> case when he was hungrie and in want, and God tooke it well.
  But how can he take it well at thy hands, that thou shouldst take away the
  bread from thy hunger-starued Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or from a poore needy soule, to offer it
  on the Altar? <hi>Athanasius</hi> reporteth another effect of couetousnes far
  more brutish and abhominable, who when hee <pb n="367" facs="tcp:22083:195"/> fled from
  Alexandria where he was Bishop, for feare of the Manichees and the Arrians,
  they exercised so many cruelties vpon the Catholickes, that treating them in a
  most inhuman and cruell manner, they condemned it to bee a sinne to succour the
  poore, and the streets being full of wretched and miserable people, no man
  durst looke vpon them, nor offer to releeue them, least they should be

  with such a one, That he is notworthie to be esteemed a friend, because thou
  canst not trust him with the murdering of such a man, the taking of such a
  purse, the robbing of such a house, nor with thy whoredomes nor adulteries, and
  the like. The Gentiles in the Primitiue Church did murmure against the
  Christians, saying, That they were an vnprofitable, impertinent, miserable, and
  nigardly kind of people; and the reason of it was, for that they would not eat
  with them till they vomited vp their meat as they sate at boord, nor drinke
  with them till they were ouertaken with wine. <hi>Tertullian</hi> makes an
  Apologie in their defence, and saith, That Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, should not only be
  Christians but also to seem to be that which they are. S. <hi>Augustine</hi>
  confesseth in his Confessions, That the World in his time was growne so

  diuers and sundrie colours verie beautifull to behold. The Bridegroome aduiseth
  his Spouse, That shee should weare her colours in her heart; and as if that
  were not sufficient enough, he wills her to weare them on her arme. Our Sauior
  Christ in his praying and other occasions,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi>

               <p>So that God will haue the exercise of soule and bodie both

               <p>
                  <pb n="369" facs="tcp:22083:196"/>First, Because God being Creator of both,
  it is fit that hee should bee serued by both.</p>
               <p>Secondly, For mans satisfaction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For in regard that Man
  cannot see mans Faith, nor that pittie and compassion that he beareth in his
  bowells, it is requisite that he should manifest the same by some outward
  signes; for he can hardly shew himself religious towards God; who is
  irreligeous towards Man. And therfore it is said, <hi>With the heart we beleeue
  vnto Righteousnes, but with the mouth we confesse to Saluation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Occasion is offered to receiue the Sacraments, or a necessitie
  of giuing a testimonie of our Faith; here euery Christian is bound to manifest
  the same by outward signes.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The sanctitie and holynesse of the Soule doth giue
  force and vertue to that of the bodie, and that of the bodie doth confirme and
  augment that of the Soule; the heart giues vigour and vertue to deuout eyes, to
  hands lifted vp, and to knees humbly kneeling on the ground. And these outward
  ceremonies doe strengthen, increase, and inflame the Spirit and inward
  deuotion. Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> saith, That God hath no need of these
  ceremonies for the better manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station of our mind, but that Man hath need
  thereof for to kindle &amp; stir vp more zeale and feruour in himselfe, being
  that by them the hearts affection is the more set on fire. And Saint

               <p>The cleannesse of the heart ought to performe the exercise of
  all the vertues, but Fastings, Prayers, and Almesdeeds comming forth of a soule
  heart, like wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters flowing from a foule conduit, corrupt those wholesome

  if the outward be more punished, it is because of it's more hurt through it's
  ill example. The workes of Vertue are not all equall, yet al of them haue one
  ground &amp; foundation, which is the loue &amp; feare of God. <hi>Abraham</hi>

  prophecied of the wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched ruine and miserable desolation of Babilon, and
  paints it forth so to the full, that there shall remaine no more reliques
  thereof than of Hierusalem: It shall be made (saith he) a dwelling for
  Hedge-hoggs, and a standing Poole of filthie stin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king waters, and as a Citie
  that is vtterly ouerthrowne and destroyed: all shall be as heapes of earth and
  hollow bankes, wherein shall be bread all kind of cree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping wormes, and
  vermine, and venimous creatures; all shall bee pits, wherein shall be puddles
  of water for to make an habitation for Toads, Snakes, Adders, and Serpents.
  This shall bee the wretched condition and miserable estate of this great
  Babylon. He farther addeth, <hi>That he will sweepe it with a broome</hi>; a
  place so foule and so sluttish, as well in respect of those heapes of earth and
  rubbish, as also those filthie pooles and stinking puddles of water, How is it
  possible that he should come to sweepe it and make it cleane? I will sweepe it

<hi>Tertullian</hi> and Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> doth inferre that <hi>Peter</hi>
was married; for Mother in Law signifieth, an affinitie deriued from mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.
And howbeit it seemeth vnto Saint <hi>Hierome,</hi> That the wife of Saint

there was a principall Temple, which had in it foure hundred and eighty

pillow whereon to leane his head.</hi> Why did Christ take pleasure in such a
strange kind of pouerty? Because thou shouldest take pleasure in giuing him
entertainment. When <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> went forth to meet the three men from out
his Tent, bowing himself down to the ground before him who he thought was the
chiefest among them, he said, <hi>Lord, if I haue now found fauour in thy
sight,</hi> goe not I pray thee from thy seruant;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.</note> let a little water I pray you be brought
and wash your feet, and rest your selues vnder the shaddow of this Tree, and I
will bring a morcell of bread that you may comfort your hearts, afterward yee
shal goe your wayes. They accepted of his kindnesse, and thanked the good old
man; but he vsing none of these court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly complements, in his plaine countrie
fashion assured them that they were hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily welcome, and that hee thought
himselfe beholding vnto them, that they would take such as they found.
<hi>Abraham</hi> he runnes me to the beasts, &amp; takes me a tender and good
Calfe, kills it, giues it to his seruant, who hasted to make it readie; then he
hies him in to <hi>Sarah,</hi> &amp; wils her presently to make readie at once
three measures of fine meale, to knead it quickely, and make Cakes vpon the
hearth. The cloath is now layd, bread, butter, milke, and the Calfe which hee
had prepared, is set before them; they fall too, &amp; <hi>Abraham</hi> he in
the mean while stands by, and waits vpon them. When they had eaten, they tooke
their leaue and went on their way, and hee likewise went with them to bring
them on the way. This vertue <hi>Lot</hi> had learned from him: Saint
<hi>Paul</hi> commends him highly for it: And <hi>Peter</hi> stiles him, Iust,
<hi>He was righteous both in seeing and hearing. Chrysost.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. <hi>Peter.</hi> 2.</note> saith, That he staid waiting for
these strangers in the street, &amp; at the gates of the Citie, till it was
late in the night, that they might not light into the vncleanly conuersation of
these wicked Citisens. So that it was late ere hee met with these Angels and
adoring them as <hi>Abraham</hi> had done before, he said vnto them, <hi>My
Lords, I pray you turne in now into your seruants house</hi>:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.</note> And the Angells making shew that they
would abide in the Street all night, hee pressed vpon them ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly, and in a
manner pulled them in by force; <hi>Coegit illos, Hee was wonderfull instant
vpon them.</hi> This inforced courtesie of his, they afterwards fully requited,
by notifying vnto him, How that Sodome was to bee destroyed with fire from
Heauen. And although the Angells made hast to be gone, and to haue <hi>Lot</hi>
to get him packing out of the Citie; yet they deferred the punishment a while,
that he might haue time to warne his sonnes in Law to bee gone. <hi>Lot</hi>
thereupon went out and spake vnto his sonnes in Law which had married his
daughters, &amp; sayd, Arise, get you out of this place, for the Lord will
destroy the Citie; but he see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med vnto his sonnes in Law as though he had
mocked. Then the Angels hasted <hi>Lot,</hi> saying, Arise, take thy wife and
thy two daughters which are here, left thou be destroyed in the punishment of
the Citie. And as hee prolonged the time, the Angels caught both him and his
wife, and his two daughters, by the hands, and brought him as it were forth by
force, and set him without the Citie; so he was saued, and the rest were
burned. In this vertue of Hospitalitie there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie famous women much
renowned in the Old Testament; as the Shunamite that entertained
<hi>Elisha,</hi> and the widdow that harboured <hi>Elias; Rahab</hi> who
recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the Spies that were sent to Ierico: All of them being so happie in
this their hospitality, that it seemeth God sent them such good guests, more
for the good of those that gaue them this friendly entertainement, than that of
those who were entertained by them. And if a man shall pay so well for his
Lodging, <pb n="376" facs="tcp:22083:201"/> how much more will God requite it?</p>

God, a God of Vengeance and a God of Mercie, betweene a Lyon and a Lambe; that
Christs friends should haue had a priuiledge, and that scarce a house of theirs
should haue knowne what sickenesse, danger, or death had meant. In the Floud,
<hi>Noahs</hi> house was preserued; in the flames of Sodome, that of
<hi>Lot</hi>; and in that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall massacre of the First-borne of Aegypt, the

man cloathed with Linnen, which had the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Inkehorne by his side, to take
notice of the people of Hierusalem, hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to set a marke vpon the
forehead of his friends, that hee might ouerskip them, and not touch them in
the day of destruction. But here now, a friends house is not priuiledged, no
not the house of <hi>Peter.</hi> What should be the reason of it? There are
many; but the main reason is this, With God, tribulation was euermore a greater
token of his loue &amp; fauor, than prosperity: what said <hi>Iob</hi> when he
sate scraping his sores vpon the Dunghill? <hi>In my prosperitie I onely heard
thee; but now in my affliction I see thee.</hi> S. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> saith,
That <hi>Cain</hi> in killing <hi>Abel,</hi> thought that Heauen would doe him
those fauours which it did his brother; but he was deceiued, for God did better
loue a dead <hi>Abel,</hi> than a liuing <hi>Cain; Non extraxisti, sed
incendisti. Philon</hi> saith, That the fire in the bush was so far from
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming or burning it, that it left it fresher and greener than it was
before. But for all this, our miseries in the Old Law were neuer seene to be so
honourable as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, when God had clapt the thornes (which were the fruit
of our sinnes) vpon his owne head,<note place="margin">The thornes of Christ are

then did they recouer so high a Being, and grew to that worth, that the heauier
God layes his hand vpon vs, the more is his loue toward vs. The marke of our
happinesse is the Sonne of God, not glorified, but scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, spit vpon,
crowned with thorns, torne with whips, and nailed to the Crosse; and therefore
to bee conformed to the Image of his Sonne, is fitting for vs. In the

were farre greater, and beyond the tongues expression. The Angells did scatter
the coles of Gods wrath abroad in the World, sometimes lighting in one place,
and sometimes in another; but whose coles could bee hotter than his, whose

saith, That the wound of the Soule is taken away by making another wound of
repentance and true sorrow. <hi>Euthymius</hi> citeth to this purpose that
verse of <hi>Dauid, Qui dat niuem sicut lanam,</hi> Snow to the earth is as

floures and fruits of good life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>She was taken with a great Feauer.</hi> The Phisitions call a
Calenture or burning Feuer, <hi>Calorem extraordinarium, An extraordinarie
heat,</hi> or <hi>calidam intemperiem, a hot distemperature,</hi> which being
kindled in the heart, and taking fire, disperseth it selfe through all the
parts of the bodie, catcheth hold of them, offends them, and discomposeth that
harmonie of the humors, wherein our health consisteth. Saint <hi>Isidore</hi>
deriues it from <hi>Feruor,</hi> or that hast and speed wherewith it runneth
and disperseth it selfe through our bodies. <hi>Valerius Maximus</hi> sayth,
That in antient time they did offer sacrifice thereunto, as to a Goddesse,
because of all other sicknesses, a Feuer is that which commonly comes to make
an end of our liues. For as heat well tempered giues life; so beeing
distempered it brings death. But if we shall goe philosophising from the
infirmities of the bodie, by way of analogie, or proportioning them to the
soule; Loue to the soule, is as Heat to the bodie. And when it doth not exceede
the Laws of God, which is the life of our soule, it inioyes perfect health; but
when it growes once to an excesse, it falls into a Calenture, or burning Feuer.
And this excesse succeedeth two ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of wayes.</p>
            <p>Either by louing that more, which ought to be loued lesse.</p>
            <p>Or by not louing that enough, which ought to be loued most.</p>
            <p>The Spouse sayd of her Bridgroome, <hi>Ordinauit in me
charitatem,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.4. Two things cause a feuer

mee, He brought me into the wine celler, and Loue was his banner ouer me: He
stayd me with flaggons, and comforted me with apples, when I was sicke of Loue:
His left hand was vnder my head, and his right hand did embrace mee.
Extraordinarie was this Loue of the Bridegroome to his Spouse, preferring her
before all other things whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. God likewise beeing the greatest in Nature
and Essence, ought to bee the greatest in our Loue and Affection.<note place="margin">How God ought to be loued.</note> Next vnder God enter those goods
of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen &amp; of Earth. And Good, being the marke whereat our Loue shoots,
our grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test Loue should direct it selfe to the greatest good. And this is to
obserue an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and good temper in our Loue. Now touching the disorder of our
Loue, our Sauiour sayd, <hi>Hee that loues Father or Mother more than mee, is
not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of mee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againe, In not louing God, to whom wee owe so much loue, this

               <pb n="378" facs="tcp:22083:202"/>Besides, In imploying our loue so wholely
vpon the Creatures, we may chance to choake that loue which we owe to the
Creator. Saint <hi>Austen</hi> expounding that place of <hi>Iohn, Loue not the
World,</hi> neither the things that are in the world, saith, That our heart is
like vnto a vessell,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 2.</note> which if it
be filled full with the World, it cannot receiue God; beeing like to that peece
of ground, where the Tares did choake the Wheate: So that of force wee must
emptie the vessell, and weede well the ground of our hearts, that the loue of
God may fructifie in vs. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate loue doth set the heart, like a
Calenture, on fire. <hi>From the heart come all our euill thoughts,</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>She was taken with a great Feuer.</hi> As there are diuers
kinds of Feuers, so haue they a correspondencie with the diuers infirmities of
the soule; your young men are soone rid of their Feuers, especially if their
fits bee not violent: but an old woman that is taken with a great Feuer, wil
hardly recouer her health. A prisoner will easily shake off slight and slender
shakles, but those that are double chained and double bolted, he will hardly
free himselfe from them. One single stick is easily broken; but more beeing
bound together, verie hardly. <hi>A threefold cord is hardly broken.</hi> The
like reason may be giuen of old sinnes, vpon which, custome hath drawne a
necessitie. Saint <hi>Austen</hi> treating of the State of his owne sinnes,
sayth, That he was fast fettered with three strong chaines:</p>
            <p>The one, of his owne Will.</p>
            <p>The other, of an ill Custome that he had gotten.</p>
            <p>The third, of a kind of necessitie, which did keepe him as it were
by force in this so hard and cruell slauerie, <hi>Tenebat me, dura
seruitus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>They besought him for her.</hi> The motiues of this
intercession, were:</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Pittie hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies a prayer in readinesse for
  those that neede it.</note>First, For that this good old woman, was of so sweet
a disposition, and so lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a nature: Which was much in so old a woman; and
no small matter, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering shee was a Mother in Law. It may be, Mothers in
lawe in those dayes, were more louing, and better beloued than they are now.
And one great argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof is, That our Sauiour Christ should put the loue
of the Mother in law and Daughter in law, in one and the same degree with that
of the Children &amp; Parents, as it appeareth in that place of S. <hi>Mathew.
I came to set a man at variance against his Father,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.</note> 
               <hi>&amp; the Daughter against her
Mother, and the Daughter in law against her Mother in law.</hi> Where you see
he links them together all in one chaine. And so it ought to be: For, if the
Husband and the Wife, by Matrimony remaine one flesh; the Daughter in law ought
likwise to be so with the Mother in law, though not in the selfe same degree,
wholly and altogether.</p>
            <p>The second motiue, was the intreatie of the Apostles, who (as
Saint <hi>Marke</hi> maketh mention) interceded for her. And such pittifull
hearts, and tender bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els as theirs were, beeing sought vnto by so good an
Hostesse, who desired so much as she did, to serue them, could not chuse but
take pittie of her, and speake a good word for her. Besides, the miserable
paine she was in might haue moued the hardest heart to compassion, much more
theirs, whose eyes had seene in what an ill taking she was in. And kind hearts
are soone sencible of those sorrowes which the eyes shall impart vnto them.</p>

            <p>The one, That we persuade our selues that they are preuailent with
God, and that they can effect much with his diuine Maiestie.</p>
            <p>The other, That he is well pleased that we should make vse of
them, for the <pb n="379" facs="tcp:22083:202"/> honour that hee receiues thereby, &amp;
the good that we reape by it. A King is well pleased that men should haue
recourse to his Fauorit, the more to honor him. It was a great honour to Christ
(saith <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi>) that he was the Mediator betwixt God and
Man. Saint <hi>Cyril</hi> giues the same attribute to the Apostles; and
<hi>Deutronomie,</hi> to <hi>Moses, Medius fui inter Deum &amp; vos,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.</note> 
               <hi>I stood betweene the Lord and
you.</hi> But here is the difference, That the Saints haue need that others
should intercede for them, but our Sauiour hath no such need, <hi>sed accedit
per teipsum, ad interpellandum pro nobis.</hi> Al other Mediators are through
our Sauior Christ; &amp; that prayer which hath not this mediation, Saint
<hi>Augustine</hi> saith, That in stead of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moouing sinne, it reneweth sinne.
And Saint <hi>Ambrose,</hi> That Christ ought to be the Mouth by which we are
to speake, the Eyes by which wee are to looke, and the Hands by which wee are
to offer. In a word, The Saints of God are verie powerful with God, through
Christ our Lord. And therefore it is said, <hi>Whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer yee shall aske the
Father in my name shall be granted vnto you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some make a doubt, Whither this be to be vnderstood of the Saints
that are liuing, or those that are dead? That it is meant of the liuing, there
are many proofes thereof in Scripture. To <hi>Iobs</hi> friends God said,

(saith Saint <hi>Augustine</hi>) <hi>Paul</hi> was reduced to the Church. In

complexion of the Sicke, looke on his tongue, and feele his pulse; so in a
manner our Sauiour Christ vsed the like kind of ceremonies, hauing a vigilant
eye ouer those that are soule-sick, and what course is to be taken for the
curing of a penitent Sinner, and to know how to distinguish betwixt leaprosie
and leaprosie. Many of the Saints did, the better to dissemble their miracles,
vse ceremonies, though there was no necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of them, nor were essentiall
for that businesse: so the Apostles by laying their hands on the Sicke did
heale them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Saint <hi>Mathew</hi> saith, <hi>Tetigit manum
eius,</hi> The touch of the hand was enough to cure the sick: for the flesh of
our Sauior Christ, for that it was the flesh of God, gaue life and health to
all that toucht it, <hi>Virtus de illo exibat &amp; sana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat omnes, A certaine
vertue went out from him and cured all men.</hi> Our Flesh will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect other
flesh with it's sickenesse, but health and life was a priuiledge appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
onely to our Sauiour Christs flesh, which (as it is noted by Saint
<hi>Augustine</hi> 
               <pb n="380" facs="tcp:22083:203"/> and Saint <hi>Cyril</hi>) by the
vnion with the Diuinitie did quicken and giue life. <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus est qui
viuificat, caro autem non prodest quidquam,</hi> It is the Spirit that
quickneth, as for the Flesh, it profiteth nothing: as an yron being heated doth
burne by it's vnion with the fire; so the Flesh of our Sauiour Christ, &amp;c.
And from this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Flesh, the vertue thereof did extend it selfe to his
verie cloathes. <hi>Si tetige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro ta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tum fimbriam vestimenti eius,
saluaero,</hi> said the woman that was troubled with the bloudie Flux, If I can
but come to touch the hemme of his garment I shall be whole.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Malach.</hi> 4.</note> 
               <hi>Malachie</hi> prophecied thereof in
these words, <hi>Sanitas in pennis eius,</hi> Health shall be vnder his wings;
and as feathers are to birds, so to man are his cloathes.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, When a sicke bodie is growne so weake that he can scarce
put forth his voyce, the Physition leanes downe his head the better to heare
him: and when he is so weake that he cannot rise of himselfe, the Physition
lends him his hand, <hi>Apprehensa manu eius</hi> (saith Saint <hi>Marke</hi>)
<hi>curauit eam.</hi> This burning Feuer had brought this good old woman so
low, that Christ did bow downe his head to hearken vnto her, and tooke her by
the hand to helpe her vp. Nor was it much that our Sauiour Christ should raise
those that were fallen, for that hee came into the world for this end, and had
so great a desire thereunto, that hee was willing to fall himselfe, for the
raising vp of vs. Nay, it was a Precept of old, That if a Beast should take a
fall, a man should not goe on vpon his way till he had holpe him vp. This
desire of his is much indeered by the Prophets; <hi>He bowed the Heauens and
came downe, he got vpon the Cherubins and flew,</hi> saith <hi>Dauid.</hi> And
in another place, <hi>Stretch forth thine hand from on high, and deliuer me out
of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie waters.</hi> The Sinner being almost drowned in the mud of his
sinnes, cries out vnto God to lend him his hand to get him out; but hee weighed
so heauie, that he pulled God after him.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Zach.</hi>

               <hi>Zacharie</hi> saith, <hi>Thou also through the bloud of thy
Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant hast loosed thy prisoners out of the pit, &amp;c.</hi> Where wee are
to weigh this same, <hi>Thou also</hi>; for though thou wert so great and
powerfull a God, yet it cost thee the best bloud in thy veines, to take those

               <hi>He rebuked the Feuer and it left her.</hi> He spake the
word, and the Feuer obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; he commanded it to be gone, and it was gone in an
instant. <hi>Origen</hi> saith, That one of the foulest and shamefullest things
that the Creatures shall lay to Mans charge at the day of Iudgement, is, That
all other creatures from the creation of the World hauing beene obedient to
Gods Empire, without digressing in the least point or tittle, onely Man hath
beene inobedient, impudent, &amp; shamelesse. This is the generall opinion: but
to reduce this to our present purpose, and to shew how obedient this Feuer was,
we know that God vseth his Creatures as so many whips and scourges.</p>
            <p>One while he makes vse of those that are without life, as of
waters &amp; darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,<note place="margin">No creature but is pliable to the
  will of God.</note> in those plagues of Aegypt, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Another while, of those that haue life, as the Serpents of the
Wildernes, the Lyons which in Samaria slew the Assyrians, the Beares which
killed the little children which mockt <hi>Elisha,</hi> &amp;c. All do mooue
and obey at the becke of Gods brow, at the cast of his eyes, as the second
causes at the motion of the <hi>Primum mobile.</hi> The like succeedeth in the
Angells; nor is it much, considering the great good which they enioy. But which
is more, it succeedeth so in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uills, who tugge at the Oare in Hells
Galley. Our Sauiour Christ commanded some Deuills, That they should not speake
a word, nor offer so much as to open their lips, when their hearts were readie
to burst because they might not speake <pb n="381" facs="tcp:22083:203"/> their mind. But
it is a lamentable case, that one man should serue to punish ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man, and
be made the instrument of his hurt, or become his Hangman. <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat</hi>
commanded the Roman Souldiers to whip Christ; and they might haue bin excused,
had they not exceeded their Commission. It was decreed in Heauen, &amp;
foretold by the Prophets, That he was to be whipt; but the justice of God
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting it self with a few stripes, these bloudy villains gaue him 5000.
&amp; but that his houre was not yet come, they would if it had been poss<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ible haue whipt him to death. A common
Hangman dare not exceed the order of the Iudge; but Man, when God makes him the
Executioner of his wrath, breakes the bounds of his Commission, and runnes
ryot. Man beeing set on by God, is like a Mastiffe that is set on by his
Master, who is easily put on vpon Bull or Beare, but hardly taken off.
<hi>Esay</hi> saith, That God made <hi>Zenacharib</hi> the rod of his
wrath,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Esay</hi> 10.</note> and the staffe of his
indignation; and that he commanded him to take the spoyle, and to take the
prey, and to tread them vnder feet, like the mire in the street; but excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
his Commission (Gods purpose being onely to humble his Children, and bring them
to repentance) he afterwards scourged him soundly for it. <hi>Iudignatio mea in
manu tua</hi>; God had put this chastisement into the hands of a tyrant (as his
instrument) who had not the wit to carrie himselfe accordingly, &amp; therefore
he punished him according to his desarts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He rebuked the Feuer and it left her.</hi> Saint
<hi>Augustine</hi> deliuereth some mens opinions, who affirme, That things
without life, as Sickenesse, Pestilence, &amp; Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, were occasioned by
euill Angells, one while for our good, another while for our hurt; but alwayes
for the seruice of God, and to shew themselues obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to his Empire. And
this is the true sence and meaning of <hi>Imperauit febri, He rebuked the
Feuer</hi>; and of <hi>Vocauit famem, He called a Famine.</hi>

doth heare and obey his will.</p>
            <p>In this Article there are two manifest truths.</p>
            <p>The one, That the Angells, as well good as bad, are many times
ministers of our punishments, by famine, pestilence, barrennesse, tempests,
sicknesse, &amp; death. And this truth is made good by innumerable stories in
Scripture; as in that of <hi>Iob,</hi> whose Corne the Deuill destroyed, threw
downe his Houses, carried away his Cattell, and killed his Children; That of
<hi>Sarah,</hi> who had seuen husbands slaine by <hi>Asmodeus</hi> the Deuill;
Those plagues of Aegypt, whereof (saith <hi>Dauid</hi>) the Deuills were the
Instruments; <hi>He cast vpon them the fiercenesse of his anger, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation,
and wrath, and vexation, by the sending out of euill Angells,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 78.49.</note> where God makes them his Hangmen or
Executioners. And in another place, <hi>Fire and haile, snow and vapours,
stormie winds, which execute his Word, &amp;c.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 148.</note> Of good Angels there are likewise many
stories; as that of those that came to Sodom; and that of the Angell that slew
the souldiers of <hi>Zenacherib.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other, That to haue things without life to be obedient to the
Empire of our Sauiour Christ,<note place="margin">Euen things without sence are
  obedient vnto God.</note> there is no such necessitie that they should bee
mooued and gouerned by Angels, either good or bad, as Saint <hi>Hierome</hi>
and Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> haue both obserued. For albeit towards vs, and in
themselues they are insenci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, yet towards God they are not so, <hi>He calls
the things that are not, as if they were.</hi> Nor is it any thing strange,
that the Heauens or the Earth should haue eares, or that those things should
answer and obey at Gods call, whose end is Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: the waters at Gods
command gather themselues into heapes, and when he sayes but the word, they
againe withdraw themselues: he prescribes bounds to the Sea, [<hi>Hitherto
shalt thou come, and no further:</hi>] at his Word againe,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 106.</note> the Sea is <pb n="382" facs="tcp:22083:204"/> made
drie land: he layes his command vpon the fire to giue light, but not burn,
curbing this his actiue qualitie, as it did in the

               </gap>irie Furnace, when the childeren
came forth vntoucht. At this Word the waters gushed out of the hard Rocke; the
Winds are at his command; death and life, sicknesse and health, and al things
else whatsoeuer, doe truly and punctually obey his will; and so in this place,
he had no sooner said the word, <hi>But her Feuer left her.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And rising vp, she presently ministred vnto them.</hi> In
regard that shee was an old woman she might verie well haue excused her selfe
from doing this seruice, but her health was so perfect, her recouerie so sound,
and her strength so increased, that without further tarriance, <hi>She
presently ministred vnto them.</hi> Your earthly Physicke is long a working,
and the Cures prooue imperfect, but Gods physick workes <hi>contin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ò presently</hi>; for, <hi>All
Gods workes are perfect.</hi> But it is not so in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. <hi>Pierius</hi>
makes the Vulture the emblem of nature, <hi>Auolatus tarditate,</hi> being a
kind of Tortoise in his flying.</p>
            <p>First of all, it is intimated here vnto vs, What hast a Sinner
ought to make to get vp. S. <hi>Peter</hi> being in prison, the Angell said
vnto him, <hi>Surge velociter, Arise quickely</hi>;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Acts.</hi> 12.</note> and without any more adoe, not staying
vpon his gyues, chaines, the gates, or the guards, he presently riseth vp and
gets him gone with all the speed he could. <hi>Noah</hi> puts the Crow out of
the Arke, <hi>Dimisit Corvum, qui egredieba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, &amp; non reuertebatur</hi>:
The Hebrew Text hath it, <hi>Exiuit, exeundo, &amp; redeundo</hi>; He began to
make wing, but seeing such a vastnesse of waters, fearing to faile in his
flight, he returned backe againe: but being entred, carrying about him the sent
of those dead carcasses which had perished by the Floud, he went to and fro so
long, till at last he went his way and was neuer seene any more. Many there are
that will put one foot forward, and pull two backeward, make you beleeue that
they meane to goe on well in vertue and goodnesse, but beeing discouraged with
the difficultie of getting vp that hill, and hauing a monthes mind to follow
the sent of their former stinking (howsoeuer to them sweet seeming) sinnes, at
last they are vtterly lost and neuer more heard of; so apt is sinfull man to
leaue the best and take the worst.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">He that hath receiued a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, must
  ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse his thankfullnes.</note>Secondly, By this her seruice this good
deuout old woman made known her bodily health; and by the ioy and comfort shee
tooke therein, shee manifested her soules health. At the verie first voyce of
<hi>Ezechiel,</hi> the boughes began to mooue, but as yet they had not life in
them, [<hi>Ossa arida, audite Verbum Domini</hi>] they were afterwards knit and
ioyned together, and set in verie good order: but they had need of another kind
of voice than <hi>Ezechiels</hi> to giue them spirit &amp; life. Saint
<hi>Augustine</hi> expounding that place of Saint <hi>Iohn, Verba mea,
Spiritus, &amp; vita sunt</hi>; saith, That this Spirit and life is in
himselfe, and not in thee. For that Poeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent which doth not giue some signe
or token of life, hath not yet obtained life; and that, He that in his seruice
and attendance doth not make shew that he is free of his former Sickenesse, his
health may iustly be suspected. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> giues vs this Lesson,
<hi>He that steales, let him steale no more, but, &amp;c.</hi> Hee must not
onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent himselfe with not stealing, or with working for his liuing, and
that it is enough for him to haue laboured hard; but of that which hee hath got
by the sweat of his browes, hee must giue part thereof to the Poore, if not for
the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of his former thefts, yet to shew himselfe a good Christian
by obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the rules of charitie. <hi>Zacheus</hi> did performe both these;
the one, in making a fourefold restitution to those whom he had defrauded by
forged cauillation, the other,<note place="margin">Ep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 4.</note> by giuing to the Poore the
one halfe of his goods. <hi>Let all bitternesse, and anger, and wrath, crying
and euill speaking</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>bee put away from 
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:22083:204"/> you, with all maliciousnesse.</hi> First of all, there
must not abide in your brests the least smacke of bitternesse, anger, wrath,
euill speaking, nor any other malicious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. But because it is not enough to
shun euill, vnlesse wee doe also: he thing that is good; he addeth in the
second place that which followeth anon after, <hi>Be yee courteous one toward
another, and tender hearted.</hi> For a good Surgeon ought no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> only to take away the paine in the
leg, but also to inable it to go.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, She did discouer this beginning of her amendment and
recouerie, by imploying this her health in the seruice of our Sauior Christ;
and by laying it downe at our Sauiours feet, she shewed that she was not ill
bred. If he that is recouered of a sicknesse, when hee is able to set foot on
ground, and to walke vp and downe his chamber, shall haue recourse vnto God,
and giue him thanks for this his restored health, it is a signe that God gaue
it him. Thankes slowly gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen (saith <hi>Seneca</hi>) lessens the benefit
receiued. <hi>Aristotle</hi> tells vs, That the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians admitted no other
Temple, saue that of Thankefulnesse, to the end that they might not be slacke
and dull in making their acknowledgement. And if he be blamed that is idle and
slow in rendring of thanks, What shall we say to him that neuer comes to offer
his seruice, but is carelesse in committing of sinne, and offends dayly more
and more?<note place="margin">The embleme of ingratitude</note> The Moone may

stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed till the Sunne set, for the obseruation of the Sabboth was so strict
with them, that they held it not lawfull on that day to cure the Sicke, much
lesse to bring them abroad in a bed or a chaire: And therefore said the Priests
vnto the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>There are six days in which men ought to work, in them

            <p>The other, That this particle is causall; he would not permit them

            <p>In this second sence, this sequell may be made, That the Deuils

or flattering manner, though they had not any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him: so that which
of these two is most probable, it is yet depending <pb n="384" facs="tcp:22083:205"/> to be
prooued, whither they knew him or knew him not?</p>
            <p>In fauour of the former, to wit, that they knew him, we read in
the Gospell, That the Deuils had thrice confessed Christ, To be the holy one of
God, to be the Sonne of God, and the Sonne of the most Highest. In this verie
Chapter one of these foule Fiends said vnto him, <hi>What haue we to doe with

            <p>Where it is to be noted, That albeit our Sauiour Christ permitted
the Deuils to take the name in their mouthes, of the holy One of God, and of
the Sonne of the Highest; yet did he neuer suffer them to preach, that he was
the Christ. For although the name of Messias and of Christ be all one; yet the
names of Christ and of the Messias, were the most notorious amongst the Iewes.
Both the Wise and the Ignorant did expect him and beleeued in him; but all of
them did not know that he was to be the Sonne of God. And therefore our Sauiour
Christ put this question to the greatest Doctors amongst them, pretending to
proue the diuinitie of the Messias: <hi>What thinke yee of Christ? Whose sonne
is he?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Math.</hi> 22.</note>Againe, The name of
Sonne of God, of Holy, and of Highest, may be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to any holy Prophet
whosoeuer, that is the Sonne of God by Grace; but the name of Christ was the
name of their Messias, and of their King whom they looked for, and that he
should come to redeeme Israell. And if the Deuills did publish him, they did
withall put in the hearts of the Iews a great hatred against Christ; as well by
seeing the glorie of their Messias placed vpon so meane and poore a man; as
also by seeing him thus applauded and proclaimed to the World by the Deuills,
presuming thereupon, that hee had made some Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and confederation with
them. Before <hi>Pilate</hi> they layd two things to his charge:</p>
            <p>The one, That he made himselfe the Sonne of God; and of this they
made least reckoning.</p>
            <p>The other, That he proclaimed himselfe King of the Iewes. And this
they held the heynouser crime.<note place="margin">Two things Whereof the Iewes
  accused Christ. <hi>Luke</hi> 23.</note> And <hi>Pilat</hi> hearing that hee
was the Sonne of God, began to be affraid; And would not take this for a
sufficient cause to put him to death. But when he heard that he tooke vpon him
the title of King of the Iewes, he presently pronounced sentence against him.
And the Romane souldiers, flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at his Kingdome, put vpon him the ensignes
of a King; a purple roab on his backe, a scepter in his hand, and a crowne on
his head. So that the thing which did most trouble them, was, The name of
Christ. And therefore they sayd vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, <hi>Si tu es Christus, dic nobis
palam, If thou be Christ, declare it here openly before the people,</hi> and
tell vs plainely of it. But because hee would not prouoke them nor giue them
occasion before hand, least they might accuse him in the Tribunal of Rome, he
would not make answer vnto them, nor giue them any farther know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that he
was the Christ.</p>
            <p>In fauour of the second, to wit, That they did not know him; wee
haue on our side the temptation of our Sauiour Iesus Christ: for if the Deuils
had known him, they would not haue tempted him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, They knowing him to bee the Christ and the Messias, they
must likewise know him to bee the naturall Sonne of God: for the Deuils could
not be ignorant of that in Hel, which the most learned in Iudaisme had attained
to <pb n="385" facs="tcp:22083:205"/> here on earth.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, (and it is the reason of that glorious Doctor Saint
<hi>Hierome</hi>) <hi>No man hath known the Father but the Sonne, and he to
whom the Sonne was willing to reueale it.</hi> If the Father then did not
reueale his Sonne to the Deuills, nor the Sonne him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe reueale the same, why
then surely they could not know him. But some one will say, That the Sonne did
reueale himselfe to the Deuils, not by infusing any light of Faith into them,
as hee did into those three Kings that came vnto him from the East, and to the
Prophets that were before them; nor the light of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, as hee hath to the
Blessed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but by the light of his miracles and prophecies, and by some
secret and hidden signes of his presence, (for that is S. <hi>Austens</hi>
opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion) which the Deuils might better attaine vnto than men.</p>
            <p>And this reason sufficiently proueth, That they knew him before
they temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him; yea, that they knew him euen from his birth; for then did
they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently perceiue in Iesus Christ our Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ior and Redeemer, Miracles, Prophecies, and great signes of God.
And albeit the miracles were not then so many as those which he wrought
afterwards, when he had vnfolded and spred abroad the sailes of his
Omnipotencie; yet a few were enough to make the Deuill, who hath so great an
insight into naturall causes, to conceiue and see how farre short Nature came
in this great businesse.</p>
            <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.</note> The
glorious Apostle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> treating of our Sauiour Christ by the name
of Wisedome, saith, That none of the Princes of this World knew him; for had
they knowne him, they would neuer haue crucified him. And this may likewise be
vnderstood of the Deuill, whom our Sauiour stiles the Prince of the world: but
in case it be vnderstood of men, the Earth not comming to the knowledge
thereof, to whom God might haue reuealed it, hell could hardly know it.</p>
            <p>In this doubt there are (me thinkes) two truths that are most
certaine.</p>
            <p>The one, That the Deuill had not a full and assured knowledge,
that our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Christ was the naturall Son of God: for his knowledge was not
the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Faith, nor any cleere vision, but onely opinion. And as a man
of verie great vnderstanding being without the light of Faith, howbeit by the
miracles and prophecies of our Sauiour Iesus Christ, he might happely beleeue
that hee was the Sonne of God; yet some one doubt or other will be stil
remaining, that he may not be that promised Sonne. So the Deuil, euer since our
Sauior Christ was borne, had many, and those strong suspitions, that God was
become Man: These jealousies and suspitions were dayly by so much the more
increased in the Deuill, by how much the more our Sauiour Christ went dayly
discouering the signes and tokens of his Diuinitie; till at last, seeing
himselfe as it were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinced by the euidence thereof, that he might put
himselfe out of this perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itie, he first goes about to tempt him, and
afterwards to solicite his death. And this is the opinion of that glorious
Doctor Saint <hi>Hierome,</hi> vpon the eigth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Saint
<hi>Mathew,</hi> where he saith, That all the Deuils did beat vpon this ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>, went nosing and winding of it out,
and were wonderfull both fearefull &amp; iealous of the same, but that none of
them did assuredly know so much. And Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> in his bookes
<hi>De Ciuitate Dei,</hi> saith, That our Sauiour and Redeemer Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ
manifested himselfe so far forth to the deuils, as himself was willing, and he
would no more than what was fitting, &amp; thought that fitting, which was
sufficient to daunt and terrifie them, &amp; to free those that were
predestinated, from his tyrannie. And this was the tracke that they did tre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d in, and all that they could gather
out of his miracles and former prophecies. <hi>Gregorie Nazia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">
                     <desc>••••</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> 
               <pb n="386" facs="tcp:22083:206"/> saith,
That the Deuils had a great deale of knowledge of the paines &amp; torments
which they did feele when our Sauiour Christ did cast them forth of the bodies
which they had possessed. And of this knowledge, that is to bee vnderstood
which is here deliuered by Saint <hi>Luke, Because they knew him to be
Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other, That God did hold this their knowledge in suspence
&amp; in doubt, by taking flesh in the wombe of an espoused Virgine: Which was
purposely done (as <hi>Ignatius</hi> saith) that hee might bee concealed from
the Deuill; for otherwise, the Deuils could hardly be ignorant that he was the
Sonne of the Virgine <hi>Marie,</hi> and not the Sonne of <hi>Ioseph.</hi>

should make choice of her to publish his name, to bee as it were one of his
Euangelists and Preachers of his Gospell, cannot but appeare to the World to be
one of the greatest demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Gods both bountie and goodnesse. This
made <hi>Esay</hi> to crie out, Good newes, good newes I bring you, I haue
ioyfull tydings to tell you, Fountaines haue gushed forth in the Desart, waters
haue shewne themselues in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and riuers appeare where there was
nothing before but drie land. Grace doth vsually follow the steps of Nature,
and though ordinarily your Brookes and your Riuers keepe themselues within
their owne bounds and precincts, yet sometimes they leape out of those beds
that were purposely made for them, and ouerflow those brinkes that bind them
in, watering those thirstie places that stood in need of their refreshing. Iust
so stands the case with Grace; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it commonly keeps it's vsuall and
ordinarie course, yet now and then it swells aboue it's chanels, and riseth out
of it's bed, making the wildernes a poole of waters, the barrainest grounds

            <p>And heere some one perhaps will say, I will wait for the like
comming of Gods mercie: but let me tell him, whosoeuer he be, That this is not
a going for water to the Fountaine, but that the Fountaine should bee brought
home vnto vs. It is sufficient, that wee haue so franke and free a God that
will now &amp; then conferre these his great fauours vpon vs without our
seeking of them: But what will not he doe for thee, if thou shalt seeke him
with thy whole heart? Such a one, our Sauior compares to that Merchant which
sought after pretious pearles of inestimable value. Wherein he notifieth vnto
vs that extraordinarie diligence wherewith we are to seeke after him; and this
is that <hi>Via Regia,</hi> or the Kings Highway in which we must walke, if we
mean to find him; and this was the track that was troad in by all the Saints of
Heauen: <hi>Hi sunt qui venerunt ex magna tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulatione, &amp;c. These are they
which came out of great tribulation, &amp;c.</hi> Others our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour compareth

               <hi>He came into a Citie of Samaria called Sycar.</hi> The Saints

               </gap> baptise; which raised such an inraged enuie in the hearts of them,
that it comming to our Sauiours knowledge, he left Iudea and went for Galilee,
<hi>Being inforced to passe through the midst of Samaria.</hi> Wherein he gaue
to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of the Gospell a twofold Lecture.</p>
            <p>The one,<note place="margin">A discreet feare is better than a

preferre sufferance before bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; and rather to dissemble some feare, than
to show themselues too forward; and to flye from the sword of anger than to
oppose themselues against the edge thereof. And therefore it is sayd, <hi>If ye
bee persecuted in one Citie, flye into another.</hi> Many account it a great
point of valour, and that they prooue themselues to bee stout men in standing
stiffely to their Cause, and maintaining it with an vndaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted resolution; but
this is rather Weakenesse than Fortitude, For in some occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, the greatest
Victorie, is to suffer himselfe to be vanquished.</p>
            <p>The other, (and let this be the second occasion of our Sauiours
iournie) <pb n="388" facs="tcp:22083:207"/> That the Minister of Gods word, who is to loue
all, to desire all should bee sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and that all should haue the hearing of
the Gospell, not to sow all the seed of Gods word in populous Cities.
<hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> compareth our Sauior to the Sunne, which
inlightneth the World, expelleth Darkenesse, augmenteth Plants, fomenteth
Flowers, breeds Gold in the veines of the Earth, Pearles in the shells of the
Sea, inricheth and beautifieth all Creatures, and leaues no cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the
earth, which hee doth not visite and comfort with the beames of his light and
splendor. The Pharisees murmuring, that our Sauiour Christ cured the sicke on
the Saboth, he said vnto them, <hi>My Father worketh hitherto, and I
worke.</hi> It is said in Genesis,<note place="margin">

rested from all his worke which he had made.</hi> True it is, that God had then
put an end to all the workes of his Power, but not to all the workes of his
Loue. For in doing good deedes, the three diuine persons neuer take any rest.
And as his loue in it selfe is perpetuall, so doth it still continue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

is not that worme whereunto it's vertue doth not extend it selfe. In a word, As
that Husbandman in the Gospell, did not leaue out any part of the land, but did
sow the same all ouer; so our Sauior Christ did plough that holy Land, which
had the happines to haue him set his feet thereon, and did sow in it the seed
of his Word; and by his Apostles did afterwards spred the same abroad through
all the World: and here now, fals himselfe a worke at Sichar.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And there was Iacobs well.</hi> That the memorie of dead
friends should be so pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull with God, as to make him affoord fauours to the
liuing, it is much; But that the places where his friends liued, should worke
this effect vpon him, it is more than much. But the Wel of <hi>Iacob</hi>
teacheth vs this truth, &amp; the good fortune that this woman had to find our
Sauiour sitting there, where <hi>Abraham</hi> had ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted an Altar vnto God;
where he had receiued those great promises for his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steritie; where
<hi>Iacob</hi> digg'd that Well, which was a great reliefe to that Citie. God
treating of annointing <hi>Dauid</hi> King, willed it to bee done in Hebron.
And why there more than in any other place, <hi>Abulansis</hi> renders this
reason, That, that people did not deserue so good a King as

<hi>Iacob</hi> were there inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, he would that it should be in Hebron, that
the place might supply that defect which was wanting in the peoples desert. Our
Sauior Christ being born in Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, the Angells came to tell the tidings
thereof to the Sheapheards. And why to the Sheapheards? What aduantage haue
they of Grace, Nature, or Fortune, aboue other men? Saint <hi>Ierome</hi>
sayth, That the antient Patriarchs had fed their flockes in those fields; and
that in this, as likewise in <hi>Rachels</hi> beeing buried there, consisted
this their happinesse: So that, not onely the Saints of God, but those places
wherein they liued, or dyed, will be a meanes for thee to meet with God. As in
the place where sinners meet, as in your Conuenticles of Heretickes, and
Witches, the Deuill comes amongst them, offering them imaginarie fountaines of
delights: So, in holy places thou shalt presently meet with God, who will offer
thee fountaines of liuing waters, &amp;c. <hi>Tertullian</hi> treating of the

            <p>The second circumstance was, The scortching heat of the Sunne,
which in the Sommer time is so troublesome, that a Sheepeheard or Heardsman can
hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly indure it. The Children of Israell were afflicted in Aegypt with the
tale of their brickes, with the gathering of straw for to make them, with their
skins rent and torne with rods of thornes and briars, and tormented with many
miseries: And God leading them one Sommer through the Desart of Arabia, which
was a hot sandie ground, it seemed vnto him, that it was intollerable trouble
for them to trauell in such heats, and to march on as it were in despight of
the Sun; <hi>He spread a cloud ouer them like a curtaine.</hi> Which i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Ionoh.</hi> 4.8.</note> It is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for me, Lord, to die,
than to liue. The glorious Doctor S. <hi>Austen</hi> saith, That the Sunne did
not know our Sauiour Iesus Christ till the houre of his blessed death, and that
his then retyring of himselfe, the hiding of his head, and the withdrawing of
the beames of his light, was not onely in pittie and compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his
Creator, but to shew his sorrow and repentance for that small kindnes which he
had vsed towards him when he went his journeys.</p>
            <p>The third circumstance was, The extream heat and drought of the
Countrie of Samaria; the heat of those sandie grounds being (as the Poet saith)
very fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and raging; <hi>Furit

               <hi>Wearied with his journey.</hi> The ends which God intended in

            </p>

            </p>
            <p>Secondly, S. <hi>Bernard</hi> saith, That God could haue redeemed
Mankind at a lesse rate, but that he was willing by this so painfull a course
to banish sloathfulnesse, lazinesse, and vnthankefulnesse out of mans heart.
For if God journeying in the heats, suffering the scortching of the Sunne, and
neither eating nor drinking, ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth out himselfe thus for thy sake; How canst
thou be so lazie and vngrateful to this his great paines and wearinesse, as to
sit still vpon thy stoole to take thy ease and doe nothing? How carefull were
those two <hi>Tobies,</hi> in deuising how they might requite <hi>Raphael</hi>

  12.</note> I cannot recompence the loue and kindnesse that he hath shewne vnto

Dominus saluabit eos, He shall be their Sauiour in all their tribulations, not
any Angell, but God himselfe.</hi> And here it is not an Angell that takes this
paines, and thus wearies himselfe, but it is God himselfe. Is it much then,
that thou shouldst be carefull and painefull, and toyle and moyle to doe good,
seeing thy Sauiour hath set thee so good an example, and will so well accept
and reward this thy labour and seruice?</p>
            <p>The reason whereof is much strengthened and increased, by
considering what a powerfull God our God is,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Esay</hi>
  40.</note> and what a poore thing is Man. <hi>All nations are as a drop of a

with a verie little, little lesse than nothing. And as it is in the booke of

               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sap.</hi> 11.22.</note> 
               <hi>As the
small thing that the ballance weigheth, so is the World before thee, and as a
drop of the morning dew that falleth downe vpon the earth.</hi> S.
<hi>Ambrose</hi> questions God, Why, ô Lord, so much for so little? And
his answer is, That this doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deere thy ingratitude, and his loue. This is a
thing to stunne a man, and to make him stand astonished; that the Sea should
goe after a drop of water, as if there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it should augment it's immensitie
and vastnesse; that <hi>Totum</hi> should seeke af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Nihil,</hi> he that
is all in all, after a thing of nothing, as if thereby he should bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his
Being; that God should seeke after a wench that was a water carrier, and being
so wearie (as he was) he should sit him downe vpon <hi>Iacobs</hi> Well, and
there entertaine himselfe in talke with her, How can she euer be able to
requite so great and vndeserued a kindnesse?</p>
            <p>This reason is also the more indeered, considering how little it
concernes God, and how much it imports man. What is it to God? Nothing.
<hi>What ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

him?</hi> If thou shouldst vndoe thy selfe in his seruice, thou shalt not adde
one dramme of glorie vnto him. What is it to Man? The greatest happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse that
can befall him, in that God should tyre out himselfe for him who is not worthie
the looking after. Much (saith Saint <hi>Bernard</hi>) ought man to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
on this his wearinesse, considering how deere man did cost God. It were 
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:22083:208"/> meere idlenesse in man, to thinke that God made him for
nothing, or to sit still &amp; be idle. <hi>In the sweat of thy browes shalt

soule with thoughts and cares; but he shall see that which he desired, and bee
satisfied. Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> discoursing of these our Sauiours paines,
saith, That for that he did esteeme so highly of them, they are not to be
considered as pains, but as the price of our Redemption. And if the price of
thy ransome cost God a great deale of labour and sweat, it is not much, that
the price of finding God should be thy labour and thy sweat. <hi>Laurentius
Iustinianus</hi> saith, That God had contriued it so, that the Nin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

to the end that this so sad and sorrowful a spectacle, should be of

declaring that place of <hi>Deutronomie,</hi>

and doing little or nothing for it, come to inioy the fruit of another mans
labours. Will God, That thou shalt not enioy another mans house, or his

<hi>Zenon</hi> inferreth the selfe same consequence, from that place of
<hi>Genesis,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen</hi> 3.</note> He will not but thou
shalt get thy bread with the sweat of thy browes; And doest thou thinke thou

kind of doctrine to our daintier sort of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and nice Worldlings, who
cannot be without their coaches, their warming-pannes, their perfumes, their
muffes, their banquets, their musicke, their Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, their Gardens of

thee to know (saith <hi>Greg. Nizen</hi>) that Heauen may be here fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and
prepared for vs, but not enioyed. Doe not thou wearie out thy selfe in seeking
after that which our Sauiour Christ could not find. When I see a man fare
daintily and delicately, choise and nice in his dyet and his cloathes, and as
greedie after his profit as his pleasure; I would faine know of him, being so
great a Louer as he is of a merrie and pleasant kind of life, being wholly
giuen to iol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, How he dares to goe treading and counting these his steps,
towards Hell? Doth he thinke to lead the same life there?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iesus then wearied in the iourney, sat downe on the Well.</hi>
A Trauailer comes all dust and sweat, and exceeding wearie to a fountaine, hee
washes himselfe, makes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe cleane, drinkes, sits downe, and so seekes to
shake off his wearinesse. But our Sauiour comming extreame wearie to this
fountaine, nei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>her washes himselfe,
makes himselfe cleane, nor drinkes, but onely sate thus, as beeing wearied,
that this woman might take notice of his wearisomenesse, and this his
troublesome iourney; and so <hi>Caietane,</hi> and the Cardinall of Toledo, doe
expound the word <hi>sic</hi>; that he sate euen thus vpon the Well.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="392" facs="tcp:22083:209"/>The ends why God exprest himselfe to be thus
wearie, are no lesse deepe and profound, than the former.</p>
            <p>First, Because out of this his wearinesse, the sinner might
apprehend his loue. <hi>Theodoret</hi> deriueth the name of God from a Greeke
word, which signifieth, <hi>To runne.</hi> And they gaue this name vnto God,
who tooke the starres to bee Gods. <hi>Damascene,</hi> that hee was therefore
called God, because he succours our miseries, and releeues our necessities with
that hast and speede, that thereby we may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue how much he loues vs.
<hi>Leo</hi> the Pope, expounding that place of Saint <hi>Luke, My God, my God,
why hast thou forsaken me,</hi> sayth, That these words which our Sauiour vsed
to his father, were not words of complaint; but a Lecture which he read vnto
Man, making vpon the Crosse a muster or beade-rolle of all those troubles, that
he had both in his life and death suffered for him: And therefore cryeth out, I
beseech thee (deere Father) that thou wilt giue Man eyes to see, <hi>The end
why thou hast forsaken mee.</hi> For that thy naturall sonne, should come to
this so miserable and wretched an estate, it was neither disaster nor disgrace,
nor force, nor any thing else that could cause it, but the great loue which I
bore vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Man, seeing his disease was so desperate, that it was requisite that
I should tast of this so bitter a potion, and that if I had been so
necessitated and so sick as Man was, I could not haue done more for my
selfe.</p>
            <p>We haue two principall fountaines of Loue to consider in God.</p>
            <p>The one, In his Creating of vs.</p>
            <p>The other, In his Redeeming of vs.</p>
            <p>In creating vs, hee poured forth the rich treasure of his Loue,
<hi>Thy hands made mee, and fashioned mee, &amp;c.</hi> The Beasts, Birds, and
Fishes could not say so much. All the rest of the creatures had their beeing,
God onely speaking the Word, <hi>Ipse dixit, &amp; facta sunt.</hi> But when he
came to the creation of Man, he sayd, <hi>Faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amus hominem, &amp;c.
Tertullian,</hi> and Saint <hi>Austen</hi> are of opinion, That God tooke the
forme of Man vpon him, because he had created him after his owne image, and
likenesse. Wherein hee manifested most strange pledges of his loue, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
because he was the workemanship of his owne hands [howbeit <hi>Aristotle</hi>
saies, that euery man beares a loue and affection to that which his owne hand
hath planted, and for which he hath taken paines. As God sayd vnto
<hi>Ionas,</hi> Thou weepest and takest on for thy Gourd, for which thou hast
not laboured, neither madest it to grow;] but for the good affection that he
had placed vpon man, and for that he had taken Mans likenesse vpon him.<note place="margin">Gods loue to Man in his Creation. The like in his
  Redemption.</note> But much more are wee bound vnto him, that he hath redeemed
vs. He created vs by his power, but he redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med vs by his loue; so that we owe
more to his loue than his power. His ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of our weakenesse vpon him, was
our strengthening. <hi>Thy power did create me, but thy frailtie did refresh
me,</hi> said Saint <hi>Augustine.</hi> He calls our Redemption a second
Creation: And as we vse to sing in the Church, <hi>What benefit had our birth
beene vnto vs, if we had not receiued the fruits of Redemption?</hi> So
likewise may we say, What good would our creation haue done vs, if wee must
haue perished had we not had the profit of Redemption?</p>
            <p>Secondly, For to put a Sinner in some good hope &amp; assurance;
for why should not I relie vpon Gods loue, being that he hath taken such a
deale of pains forme, and hath wearied out himselfe to giue me ease?
<hi>Zacharie</hi> represents our Sauiour Christ vnto vs with wounds in his
hands;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Zacar.</hi> 13.</note> and asking the question,
What are these wounds in thy hands? How camest thou by them? or, Who gaue them
thee? This answer is returned, Thus was I wounded in the house of my friends.
<hi>Rupertus</hi> &amp; <hi>Galatinus</hi> are both of opinion, That this is a
metaphor drawne from <pb n="393" facs="tcp:22083:209"/> a <hi>Labrador</hi> or Husbandman,
who hath his hands hardned, and a kind of <hi>callum</hi> or thicke skinne
growne vpon them through too much labour. So that seeing Man was condemned for
his offence, to dig and plough the earth, Christ vndertooke that taske for him,
as one that was willing to suffer for his friends.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Za<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>har.</hi> 13.5.</note> 
               <hi>I am a
Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>; for Man taught me to be a Heardsman from my youth vp: for, to
ease them of this burthen, I was willing to beare their punishment. He then
that shall take such pittie and compassion of me, he that shall vndergoe such a
deale of trouble for my sake, makes me to haue a strong hope and beleefe, that
he will denie mee nothing. <hi>Iacob</hi> wrestled all night with God, the
Patriarke in that strugling got a lamenesse, and God grew so wearie, that he
cried vnto him, <hi>Let me goe.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi>
  32.26.</note> But <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> answered, <hi>I will not let thee goe except
thou blesse mee.</hi> Was this a good time, thinke you, to craue a blessing?
Yes marry was it; for I standing in need there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and God waxing wearie for my
sake, What shall I aske, that hee will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie mee?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Christ shews himselfe wearie, to the end that by this his
great pains he might saue the sinner from perdition. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi>
saith, <hi>Fatigatus Iesus, quia fidelem populum inuenire non poterat, That
Iesus was wearie, because he could not find out a faithfull People.</hi> The
Sheepeheard that seekes after his lost sheepe, may wearie out himselfe verie
much in seeking of him out; but much more will hee find himselfe so, if he doe
not find him. It is not so much Gods paines that hee takes, but our sinnes, and
our wandring so farre out of the way from him, that makes him so wearie. And if
a Sheepe had but the vnderstanding to know the paines that the Sheepheard
takes, the care and wearinesse that accompanies such a strange kind of
stragling, besides his being indangered of being deuoured by that Wolfe the
Deuill, which lies in wait for his destruction; he would bee bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter aduised,
and fall a bleating after his Sheepheard Christ Iesus, and hasten into the
Fold.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The feare of a mans own hurt and condemnation; for
though God now shew himselfe vnto thee wearie, and as it were quite tired out
in seeking af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thee, who refusest to be found while it is day; thou shalt
see him hereafter in pompe and maiestie, to thy great feare and terrour. Now,
he calls vnto thee, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uites thee, and intreats thee to come vnto him; now,
thou findest him heere, sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and staying to see if thou wilt come vnto him,
beeing meruailous willing and readie to doe thee good, and to supplie thy
necessities; hee is now all pittie and mercie, but hereafter he will bee all
rigour and justice. Nothing hath put God to halfe that paines, as hath thy
sinnes; it is they that haue wearied him, they that haue wounded him, and they
that haue crucified him:<note place="margin">Our sins the cause of all Christs
  suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings.</note> and if there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now thou shalt not take the benefit of
these his paines, wounds, and cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixion, they shall hereafter condemne thee.
<hi>For you was my side opened, and yee would not enter in,</hi> saith Saint
<hi>Augustine</hi>; my armes were spred abroad to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace yee, but yee would
not come neere me; and therefore these my wounds shall be the Atotrney to
accuse you, and the Witnesse to condemne you: and all those things which
heeretofore did represent vnto you reasons of confidence and assurance, shall
now driue you into the depth of desperation, and make you call vnto the
Mountaines, with a <hi>Cadite super nos, Fall vpon vs and couer vs.</hi> The
Quaile keepes a mourning and complaining in her kind of language, when shee
sees the Sunne; and the Condemned they will likewise howle &amp; lament, when
they shall see Christ in the Heauens. The Angells did aske, Who is this that
comes from the earth so glorious and so bloudie? I haue fought a bloudie
bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell here vpon earth, triumphing like a Conqueror ouer the Deuil &amp;
Death, &amp;c. <pb n="394" facs="tcp:22083:210"/> But then they replyed and asked him,
What, bloud and wounds in Heauen? to what end, I pray you? They are memorialls
of the wrongs I receiued: And in the day of vengeance I shall say vnto you,
<hi>Behold the Man whom yee haue cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</hi> Ye shall then take notice of
these wounds, &amp; of this Crosse of myne. So that those things that are now
our strong tower, our defence, our protection, our as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance, and our loue,
shall be our feare, our cowardise, and our condemnation. In <hi>Exodus</hi> God
commanded, That they should not seeth the Kid in the milke of it's Damme.
<hi>Lyra</hi> and <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> make this Glosse thereupon,
That God would not haue that which was the beginning of it's life, to be the
instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it's death. And this may be verified of the wearinesse and
wounds of our Sauiour Christ; neither the torments of the Deuill, nor the fire
of Sodom, nor the water of the Floud which drowned all the world, nor hel it
selfe ought so much to feare thee, as to see thy God thus wearied and wounded
for thee.</p>

  such a strange thing for them to put themselues to any trouble, and so vaine is

  his desire ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by his thirst, than by his hunger.</p>
               <p>First, By taking occasion from the water which this Woman drew
  out of the Well.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Thirst a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter torment than

  doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly more afflict and torment vs; yet in the end, he did not drinke,
  drowning that his thirst in that other thirst which he had after this poore
  soule. The ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured. Spouse did not eat, though shee were hungrie, because
  her Beloued was sicke, and had no stomacke to his meat. Our Sauiour seeing this
  Samaritane had no great mind to drinke of this liuing water, doth not drinke
  himselfe, though he were athirst, and much desired to quench it with this dead
  water. <hi>Sampson</hi> hauing a Fountaine neere at hand, would not drinke,
  though he were thirstie, til he had got the victorie ouer his enemies. Saint
  <hi>Augustine</hi> saith of S. <hi>Laurence,</hi> That he did not feele the
  fire of the Tyrant, so strongly was hee affected with that diuiner fire.<note place="margin">While the Heart is aboue the starres, the heele hath no feeling of
 the Stockes.</note> So our Sauiour was not sencible of his owne thirst, nor of
  his wearisomenesse, nor of the Sunnes heat, out of the desire that hee had to
  ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine his pretended victorie. Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> expounding that place
  of <hi>Dauid, Cucurri in siti</hi>; saith, That it may be read, <hi>Cucurrerunt
  in siti</hi>: and hee prooueth it out of the Greeke word, as also that which
  followeth, <hi>Ore suo benedicebant, &amp; cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de suo benedicebant</hi>: The
  letter treateth of the Scribes and Pharisees; so that our Sauior Christ had
  thirst, and they had thirst; he thirsted for their life, they thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted for his
  death. And this was one of the reasons why our Sauiour Christ did sweat bloud
  in the garden; for that the Priests, the Scribes, and the Pharisees had decreed
  his death in that their sacrilegious Councell: for albeit they had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
  treated before of his banishing of him from amongst them; another while, of
  throwing him downe from the side of a steepe hill, and attempted many other
  disgraces and violences vpon his person; yet were they not come til now, nor
  was it euer to be supposed that they would haue beene so cruel, as to desire
  the shedding of his diuine bloud, &amp; to pursue him with that eagrenes as
  they did vnto death. And because no other desire could satisfie that their
  bloud-thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie desire, than the desires of our Sauiours bloud, to leape out of
  those his sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred veines, for their and our good; therefore, <hi>Factus est
  sudor sanguinis, &amp;c.</hi> To this end tended that <hi>Fac citius</hi> of
  <hi>Iudas</hi>: he had alreadie driuen the bargaine, and the price for which he
  sould him agreed vpon, and his feet did now itch to be gone, that he might
  receiue his money; in token that Christ had a greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to be sould, than
  he had to sell him: and therefore hee said vnto him, <hi>Quod 
  <pb n="399" facs="tcp:22083:212"/> facis, fac citius, That thou doest, do quickly.</hi> The
  like end he had in the institution of his blessed Sacrament; the deliuerie was
  promised, but before <hi>Iudas</hi> deliuered him vp, he deliuered vp himselfe;

                  <hi>How comes it, that thou being a Iew requirest drinke of

  therefore she spake as she did; but our Sauiour would not touch vpon that
  string. For, to take too much liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to our selues in our owne proper cases,
  and to vse hypocrisies and finesse in those of other men, is the condition of
  naughtie and ill natured people. Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> sayth, That when

  grace of the holy-Ghost, the Word of God, and the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Sacraments, inioy
  the selfe same vnion with that first beginning from whence they proceed.</p>
               <p>The second, That as your liuing water doth enioy a kind of life,
  &amp; vncessable motion, (for which cause the Scripture attributeth thereunto
  the actions of life, <hi>The Flouds are risen, the Flouds haue lift vp their
  voice, the flouds lift vp their waues,</hi>

  Ghost, the Word of God, and the blessed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, cause in the Soule the
  effects of life.</p>
               <p>The third, That as your liuing Water doth ascend to the height
  of it's birth and Beeing; so the Grace of the holy-Ghost, the Word of God, and
  the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Sacraments, ascend vp euen as high as to God himselfe, because
  they had their birth &amp; Being from God, he being the Spring or Wel-head from
  whence they had their rising; <hi>Fiet in eo sons aquae salientis in vitam
  eternam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If thou knewest the gift of God.</hi> First, hee setteth
  downe the originall of all our ill; which is, our not knowing, or our want of
  knowledge:<note place="margin">Ignorance a maine cause of all our euill.</note>
  According to that of Pope <hi>Clement,</hi> in an Epistle of his to the
  Councell of Toledo. And it is a most assured truth, That the first step to il,
  is the ignorance of good. <hi>Salomon</hi> saith, <hi>Without knowledge the
  mind is not good.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Prou.</hi> 19.</note> Hee calls it
  the knowledge of the soule, which is the onely thing that importeth vs for
  Heauen: As for the knowledge of the World, and the wisedome thereof, it is but
  foolishnesse with God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he doth not say, If thou didst but know who it is that
  talketh with thee, thou wouldst haue giuen him water without asking thee for
  it,<note place="margin">All that Man can giue vnto God, is to praise him for what
 he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth from him</note> &amp; wouldst haue offered him to drinke, of
  thine owne accord: though comparing Man with God, Man cannot be said to bestow
  any thing on God by way of gift or donati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; all that good correspondencie
  which can be held on mans part, is to shew himselfe thankeful for the fauours
  which he receiueth from Gods hand. If God shall giue me wealth, he doth it to
  the end that I should serue him; if he giue me honour, he doth it to the end
  that I should maintain his cause, &amp;c.. <hi>Anna, Samuels</hi> mother said,
  <hi>O Lord, if thou wilt looke on the trouble of thy handmaid,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.</note> 
                  <hi>and remember and not forget thyne
  handmaid, but giue vnto thyne handmaid a man child, then will I giue him vnto
  the Lord all the dayes of his life.</hi> Nor doth this earths pouertie owe
  ought more for those fauours which we haue from Heauen. This made Saint
  <hi>Augustine</hi> to say, <hi>Da quod iubes, &amp; iube quod vis.</hi> And the
  truth of this is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon that which is deliuered in the last Chapter of
  the first of the <hi>Chronicles,</hi> when as <hi>Dauid</hi> and the Princes of
  the people made a plentifull rich Offering of three thousand talents of gold,

  <hi>Quis prior reddit illi, &amp; retribuitur ei?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Christ did lay a double bait before this woman.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Two baits at which women vsually
 bite.</note>The one, Curiositie of knowledge.</p>
               <p>The other, Desire of receiuing. Two things wherewith that sex of
  theirs is soonest taken: and as the holy-Ghost hath said, That in another third
  thing wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans appetite is insatiable; so likewise is it in these two: and for
  this cause they compare her to a Lampe, which goes still sucking in the oyle
  with which it must continually be maintained.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">No doubt of Gods giuing, if there bee none in
 our asking.</note>Fourthly, <hi>Gregorie Nazianzen</hi> hath obserued, That our
  Sauiour Christ did put a doubt in the Samaritans desire, <hi>forsitan
  petisses,</hi> he put a doubt in her asking, but not in his giuing.</p>
               <p>To shew vnto vs, That albeit woman bee couetous in receiuing,
  yet God is more bountifull in giuing.</p>
               <p>To receiue, is proper vnto Creatures that are in need and in
  want: all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures haue their mouths stil open, crauing their fulnesse from
  God; and God he is alwayes readie at hand to satisfie their hunger. Open thy
  mouth wide (saith the Psalmist) and I shall fill it. The soule desireth but one
  onely thing, which is thy selfe, ô God, this will suffice her: <hi>Nam
  vnum est necessarium, for one thing is necessarie.</hi> But the Flesh through
  it's many longings, desireth many things; yet let it desire neuer so many, it
  shall be sooner wearied with asking, than God with giuing, if it bee for it's
  good. <hi>Abraham</hi> did entreat for Sodome till hee waxed wearie of his
  suit; and had he beene earnest therein, and not haue giuen it ouer, it may be
  God would haue spared that Citie. <hi>What shall I returne to the Lord for all
  that he hath rendred vnto me; I will take the Cup of saluation, and will call
  vpon the name of the Lord.</hi> Man is disingaged by paying, and is impawned by
  receiuing: but God holds himselfe fully satisfied for those former fauours hee
  hath done thee, to the end that thou maist craue new courtesies from him; hee
  lookes not to haue old scores paid, and desires nothing of thee but a
  thankefull acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement.</p>
               <p>And this is the reason why Christ became a suiter to this woman
  for a little water; he was willing to beg of her a draught of dead water, that
  shee might beg of him a cup of liuing water: dealing with her as a father doth
  with his prettie little sonne, begging an apple of his child, that he may
  thereby take oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to throw vpon him a thousand fauours.<note place="margin">

 4.</note> The Philippians made much of the Apostle, who thanking them for this
  their kindnesse, saith, <hi>I reioyce in your care for me</hi>; I speake not
  because of want, for I haue learned in whatsoeuer state I am, therewith to be
  content. Notwithstanding yee haue well done, that yee did commun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>cate to my affliction; not that I
  desire a gift, but I desire the fruit that may further your reckoning. The
  rendering of thankes for one courtesie, is a requiring of another; but I doe
  not thanke you to this end, but that yee may reape the fruits of your charitie
  extended toward me.</p>
               <p>But some one will say, If God be so free handed, and so
  bountifull in giuing, knowing our necessities, why doth he driue vs to beg
  these his fauours? Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> answers it thus, That God will haue
  vs to exercise our selues in the petitioning of our desires; <hi>Vt possimus
  capere quae praeparat dare, That wee may bee made capable of those kindnesses
  which God is willing to conferre vpon vs. Thomas</hi> hee puts the question
  thus; Either God will giue me this or that, or he will not giue 
  <pb n="403" facs="tcp:22083:215"/> it me: For his will is immutable; and begging, be it in
  what kind so euer, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be <hi>Quiddam accessorium.</hi> But his answere
  is, That begging is the meanes which God hath appointed and preordained,
  through which you may receiue that blessing which God before all ages was
  determined to giue vnto you. So that Prayer, is that rope or cord by which we
  draw vp water from that deepe Well of Gods euer flowing bountie.</p>
               <p>Lastly, another doubt is put, whether shee were willing to beg
  this liuing Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or no, at Christs hands? For the sinner will euerie foote
  bee crauing of the goods for the bodie, but for those of the soule he often
  stands vpon a <hi>Forsitan,</hi> being carelesse whether he haue them or no. It
  is our dayly petition, that God would giue vs the dayly bread of this life, but
  take not so much care for that of the other. The sons of <hi>Reuben,</hi> &amp;
  of <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

  Iordan, saw certain fields that were verie fertile and fruitfull, and those
  pastures seeming good vnto them for their flockes, besought <hi>Moses</hi> and
  the Princes of the people that they might haue the possession of them; loosing
  the desire of their promised Land. In like manner the sinner will be well
  content, to take for his inheritance and possession, the forbidden fields of
  the humane delights of this world, and forgoe the desire of those that are
  heauenly and diuine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If thou knewest the gift of God.</hi> When the rich denies
  the poore a cup of cold water, a morsell of bread, an old shirt, or the like, a

  Let vs suppose that the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, in sacred Scripture (as bef<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

  troubles; And let vs likewise heere deliuer vnto you, that they also signifie
  pastimes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights: And not onely humane but diuine, so farre as to become
  the Symbolum and signe of happinesse. That they signifie humane happinesse, we
  may ground it vpon this reason, that they are inconstant, fugitiue, transitory,
  and slide away as water, <hi>Omnes morimur, &amp; quasi aqua dilabimur,</hi>
  sayd the woman of Tekoah to King <hi>Dauid. Wee must needs dye, and we are as

               <p>First, Because Water is the Mother of fulnesse and aboundance.
  For that land that is without Water, voyceth out famine and hunger; <hi>Sicut

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Because nothing else can satisfie &amp; quench our

  Pretious-stones; and then will the soule crye out for Water.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Because nothing in comparison of Water can sute so wel
  with a thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie appetite.</p>
               <p>This truth beeing supposed, the Samaritan woman vttered one most

  drawne out of so deepe a Well, and with that strength of the arme, that not any
  thing can cost vs more deere in this life. <hi>Dalila</hi> placed her content
  in knowing where <hi>Sampsons</hi> strength lay; and the Scripture sayth, that
  she did sweat and toyle, and take no rest,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iud.</hi>
 16.</note> till she could come to the bottome of this Well. <hi>Ad mortem vsque
  lassata est.</hi> It was death vnto her, til she had obtained her desire. Saint
  <hi>Ambrose</hi> compareth humane pleasures and delights to the Serpent, who
  all his life time goes trailing his bellie vpon the earth, and eateth and
  licketh vp the dust therof. <hi>Boaetius</hi> compares them to the hony in your
  Bee-hyues, which although it bee sweete, yet it leaues a painefull sting
  sticking in vs. <hi>Seneca</hi> doth celebrate that saying of <hi>Virgil,</hi>
  who cals them <hi>Mala mentis gaudia.</hi> The water that came vp to
  <hi>Tantalus</hi> his chinne and glided away by him, signifieth as much. And to
  take such a deale of paines in the pursute of these transitorie pleasures and
  delights, as it betraies our Ignorance; so it makes vs to thinke that the sweet
  tast of this liuing water, is tyde to the rope and bucket.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whosoeuer drinketh of this water shall thirst againe. But
  whosoeuer drinketh of the water that I shall giue him, shall neuer be more
  athirst.</hi> Our Sauiour here sets downe the aduantages, which the liuing
  water hath of the dead; The cheifest wherof is, That he that shall drink of the
  water of this Wel, shal soone after be athirst again. For, <hi>Aunque haze
  troguas, no assienta pazes, Though he make a truce for a time, yet doth he not
  conclude a finall peace.</hi> Saint <hi>Austen</hi> vnderstands this difference
  touching the thirst of the body; but diuerse other Doctors, of the the thirst
  of the soule. But the Plainest and the surest is, that it imbraceth both, and
  to cleere this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Let vs first of all suppose, that (laying aside the
  thirst of the body) all do ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally suffer the same in the soule. And he that
  from the clouds should behold <pb n="405" facs="tcp:22083:216"/> this vale of the world,
  shall perceiue it to be like a desart, full of filthy standing pooles of
  stinking water, and that all men goe thirsting after the same. And Saint
  <hi>Austen</hi> saith, <hi>Ipsum desiderium sitis est anim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> For, as a man cannot liue without the desire of
  the soule, so can he not liue without thirst. <hi>Inquietum est cor nostrum,
  do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nec <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eniamus ad te.</hi> This
  our saturity and fulnesse is reserued till wee come vnto God, who is our
  Center. <hi>Satiabor, cum apparauerit gloria tua, I shall bee satisfied, when
  thy glorie shall appeare.</hi> In the interim, we must of force liue tormented
  with hunger, and thirst.</p>
               <p>Secondly, We are to suppose that this liuing Water, whether it
  bee the Holy Ghost, be it Grace, or the Word of God, or Baptisme, doth not in
  this life quench either that thirst of the bodie, or that of the soule.
  Touching that of the bodie, we know that many Saints of God, rauished with some
  deepe contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, haue forgotten al hunger and thirst, without any torment
  or trouble, euen to the abhorring of meate. Nor is it much that the holy Ghost
  should worke this effect in man, seeing that the vehement passions of sorrow
  and of ioy, though in a different manner do dayly cause the like. For this our
  not eating nor drinking occasioned by passion, doth debilitate our forces, and
  weakens our strength; but beeing assisted by the helpe of the holy Spirit, it
  doth not onely conserue, but renew our strength, and put as it were new mettle
  into vs; as was to be seene in <hi>Elias,</hi> who with that water and bread
  which the Angell gaue him, went vp to Mount Horeb, &amp; there fasted 40 days.
  And diuers weake men haue (holpen by Grace) indured such hunger &amp; thirst,
  as hath made the world to stand amased at it. But the holy-Ghost doth not
  alwais worke these effects, saue only when it seemeth good vnto him; nor at all
  times, nor towards all persons, no not to the verie Saints themselues; for
  those that haue beene the greatest Fasters, haue come in the end to suffer
  hunger and thirst.</p>
               <p>And if we shall treat of the thirst of the soule, it is a plaine
  case, that this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing water doth not quench it, but that the holy-Ghost doth
  to the Righteous adde more thirst after the goods of heauen, and those
  coelestiall ioyes: Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that of <hi>Ecclesiasticus, Qui edunt me,

  and not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying to their eyes (as <hi>Salomon</hi> saith) any thing whatsoeuer

  <hi>Aqua concupiscentiae,</hi> the water of concupiscence; a lusting with
  desire: and as hee that shall drinke and swallow downe these his desires,
  cannot chuse but grow more and more thirstie; so hee that shall drinke of this
  water, shall desire to drinke more: And (as <hi>Salomon</hi> saith) hee shall
  follow the birds which flie in the aire. The truth whereof is well prooued by
  that rich man in the Gospell; who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing food sufficient for many yeares, yet

  and that hee inuited his soule to feast it selfe, and to make merrie, whose
  thirst is insatiable. Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> saith, That man, not finding in
  the pleasures and pastimes of this life, any humane de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights answerable to

  his heart to curse that Creditor almost to the pit of Hell, who shall still

               <p>Others there are, which seeke to satisfie this thirst with the
  goods of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, taking onely from the earth as much as is sufficient for
  them; like vnto <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deons</hi> souldiers, who passing along by the riuer
  side, tooke vp water in the palmes of their hands. God approouing in the

               <p>Now by this time the aduantage appeareth cleere vnto vs, which
  liuing wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hath ouer that which is dead: he that shal drink of this water,
  whither it bee this naturall water, or the symbolicall water of humane
  delights, he wil quicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly become thirstie againe. For neither with the one
  water is the thirst of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die allayed, nor with the other of humane
  pleasures, that of the Soule: but hee that shall drinke of that liuing water
  that I shall giue them, shall thirst no more, reseruing it's satisfaction and
  fulnesse to that other life. This sence the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall of Toledo followes. Yet
  me thinkes there is a plainer explication of this place, to wit, That he that
  shall drinke of this dead water, be it naturall, or sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolicall, shall haue
  thirst both here and there, in this, and in that other life: in this, because
  the more water he drinketh, the more hee thirsteth: in that other, because Hell
  is a lake where there is no water. The couetous rich man could not there get so
  much as one poore drop of water; the thirst there is too raging and too hot to
  be quenched. So that this verie word <hi>Iterum, Againe,</hi> doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie an
  eternitie in their thirst; but hee that shall drinke of the liuing Water, shall
  not suffer an eternall thirst, because this his thirst shall bee allayed in
  Heauen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Shall thirst no more.</hi> In part, it may be verified of
  the fulnesse of this life.</p>
               <p>First, Because albeit the holy-Ghost doth augment the thirst of
  those diuine goods, giuing the Righteous a taste thereof, as he did in Tabor to
  the three Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, when he gaue them a relish of his glorie; yet that thirst

  of water, without the leaue of her husband, and by order from him, being so
  made one flesh, and so one spirit by marriage, that they are not to be
  seperated. <hi>Malachie</hi> treating of a married wife, saith, <hi>Nonne

  not the remainder of his breath?</hi> Whither the allusion bee made to the

  that with the <pb n="409" facs="tcp:22083:218"/> same respiration wherewith God had created
  the soule in <hi>Adam,</hi> hee like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise created that of <hi>Eue</hi>; or
  whither it haue relation to the husband, for that the selfe same spirit which
  giues life vnto him, is to giue the same likewise to his wife. Saint
  <hi>Augustine</hi> in a mysticall kind of meaning vnderstands by the man, the
  vnderstanding; but the plainer &amp; truer meaning is, That our Sauior in
  willing her to call her husband, would therby giue her occasion to confesse her
  fault, &amp; not to dismerit the mercie that was offered vnto her: for, to draw
  from a womans brest such immodest and dishonest weakenesses, will require a
  great deale of dexteritie and cunning. The seruant that ought ten thousand
  talents, presently confessed the debt, and the King forgaue it him;
  <hi>Inconfessione debiti solutionem in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenit, His confession was his
  solution,</hi> so saith Saint <hi>Chrysostome.</hi> But he was a man, and his
  fault lesse foule; but for an old woman to lie at rack and manger with her
  Louer in these her elder yeres, will aske much labour, and no lesse skill, to
  bring her to confession. <hi>Obstetricante manu eius eductus est coluber
  tortuosus,</hi> To take the subtill winding Snake out of mans bosome, we had
  need of Gods helping hand; that's the Midwife that must doe it. For to sinne
  (saith Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi>) the Deuill putteth great confidence into the
  brest of a sinner; but to confesse the same, he infuseth far greater shame: so
  that dishonestie doth not onely disjoyne vs from God, but remooues vs, like the
  Prodigall sonne, a great wayes off from him, <hi>in regionem longinquam, into a
  farre Countrie.</hi> God hath giuen vs so noble and so gentleman-like a nature,
  (saith Saint <hi>Hierome</hi>) that Sinne doth make vs melancholly and sad; but
  Vertue, cheerefull &amp; merrie. And from hence (saith Saint
  <hi>Augustine</hi>) arise those remorcements of conscience, those inward stings
  of the soule, which like the flies of Aegypt disquiet a Sinner. Our Sauiour
  Christ therefore did here make mention of her husband, (<hi>Como mentado la
  soga, en casa del a horcado</hi>: as if one should talk of a halter in the

  which Saint <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> hath in an Epistle of his to <hi>Rusticus, Post

  that they might not marrie aboue fiue times; and that the incontinencie of this

  neere the fire, and not take flame; that a young man should bee in familiar
  conuersation with a young handsome maid, and not bee tempted with an euill
  thought, is a miracle. <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philact</hi> deliuers vnto vs, That after that
  miracle of the Loaues and Fishes, the Apostles remained in the companie of
  certaine deuout women which had fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed our Sauiour Christ into the Desert,
  and were indeering vnto them the greatnesse of Gods power; and that to diuert
  them from their conuersation, <hi>Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>git illos,</hi> he inforced them to

  winds, they did runne lesse danger, than in the conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation of those good and

til that the drawing on of the night inforced him to make an end of his Sermon.
Euerie one of his Auditors hied them home to their owne houses to ease and rest
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues; but our Sauiour Christ, who had neuer a house of his owne to put
his head in, nor was inuited to any of theirs, betooke himselfe to the Mount of
Oliues, as at other times he was woont to doe; which stood in that distance
from Hierusalem, that it was but a walke, as it were, or easie Sabboth dayes
journey: in the middest whereof was that little Brooke beset with Cedars,
bending towards Bethania, where <hi>Martha</hi> and <hi>Marie</hi> dwelt. Heere
our Sauiour Christ spent that night in prayer, but early in the morning came
againe into the Temple, and all the People floc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king about him to heare him,
this Historie hapned of the woman that was taken in adulterie; whereof we are

               <note place="margin">What is typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Mount of
  O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liues.</note>
               <hi>He went into the Mount of Oliues, &amp;c.</hi> Saint
<hi>Augustine</hi> in a Sermon <hi>De Verbis Domini,</hi> (taken out of that
Tract which he made vpon <hi>Iohn</hi>) calls the Mount of Oliues, <hi>Montem
chrismatis &amp; vnguenti</hi>: And <hi>Bede</hi> addeth, That the top of this
Mount doth typifie the heigth of our Sauiour Christs pittie and mercie. And the
Euangelist here aduiseth vs, That hee came from the Mount of Oliues to the
Temple, where this Storie succeeded; because a worke of so great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and
clemencie, could not conueniently come from any other place. <hi>Moses</hi>
descended downe from Mount Sinay, but with so rigorous a Law, that he brake the
Tables in pieces, that all the People might not thereby indanger their
dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Sinay is a Bush, and from Bushes what can be expected but bruises
and brushings, and all sharpenesse of rigour? But from the Mount of Oliues,
no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could come thence but Oyle, which is that common Hieroglyph of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
and compassion.</p>
            <p>First, For it's softnesse and sweetnesse; and therefore did the
Diuine proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence so order the businesse, that Priests and Kings should bee
annoynted <pb n="413" facs="tcp:22083:220"/> therewith, signifying thereby, how louing,
milde, and gentle they ought to be.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Because it strengtheneth and inableth those members
which are weake and feeble. <hi>Deus ol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>um permisit</hi> (saith <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi>) <hi>ad
leuandos labores.</hi> Your Wrestlers did vse to annoynt themselues with Oyle,
not only that they might slip the easier out of their Aduersaries hands, but
also because it made their joynts and their limbes more strong and nimble.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, For that it is a soueraigne salue for all kind of wounds;
for there is not any thing that doth so comfort, so supple, so assuage and
disperse any ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant humor, and cure any festred sore, sooner than your
pretious Oyles. The Samaritane cured with Oyle the wounds of that Traueller
whom hee found wounded on the way to Ierico. <hi>Esay</hi> complaineth,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.</note> That no man would sucke and draw forth
the bloud from the wounds of his People,<note place="margin">

  1.6.</note> nor annoynt them with Oyle; <hi>Vulnus &amp; plaga tumens non est
circumligata, nec sota oleo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, For it's stilnesse, softnesse of nature, and little
noyse that it maketh; beat it or batter it neuer so much, poure it out neuer so
violently, it makes no noyse, but shews it selfe still and quiet; whence grew
that adage mentioned by <hi>Plautus</hi> and <hi>Plato, Oleo tranquillior, More
still than Oyle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fiftly, For the vertue that is in it for allaying of storms at
Sea, and repressing of the rage of the billowes, for (as <hi>Plinie</hi> and
<hi>Celius</hi> affirme) <hi>Oleo mare tranquilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, With Oyle the sea is
calmed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sixtly, Because there is not any liquor that doth more spread and
diffuse it selfe; <hi>Oleum effusum nomen tuum, Thy Name is as an oyntment

                  <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.</note> And the Saints declare the same of the
person of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Christ.</p>
            <p>Seuenthly and lastly, Because amidst all other liquors it is still
vpppermost<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and is alwayes swimming aloft, and euermore keeping it selfe
aboue the rest; all which are proprieties of pittie and compassion, of mercie
and louing kindnesse, which is soft, supple, and sweet this is that which
giueth ease to our trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and remedie to our paines; this is that which
refresheth and strengthneth our weake and feeble Members; this is that which
cures our wounds and assua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges the swelling of them; this is that which suffers
and sayth nothing, though neuer so hardly vsed; this is that which composeth
differences, turbulent strifes, &amp; the raging enmities of this Worlds sea;
and this is that which is a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall salue for all sores, a friend at need,
and the greatest representation of Gods glorie: for he is not seene in any

these two qualities, <hi>As a faire Oliue tree that is fruitfull, and as a
Cypresse tree which groweth vp to the Clouds.</hi> The Oliue is the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleme of
fertilenesse, for it's fruit and it's multitude of branches, and sprigges
sprouting forth of it, <hi>sicut nouellae Oliuarum.</hi> The Cypresse is the
Symbole of beautie; for although it beareth no fruit, yet it shoots vp like a
<hi>Pyramis,</hi> to an extraordinarie heigth: and both of them make the stampe
of a holy Prelate, whose mercie and compassion is most fruitfull, and whose
prayer is most beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and pleasing: for there is not any thing that man
can imagine to bee more faire, than that a creature by this meanes should come

               <p>There are foure manifest truths in matter of secrecie.</p>

                  </gap>on is, because there is no
  sinne, be it committed in neuer so secret a corner, which <pb n="415" facs="tcp:22083:221"/> doth not come forth in the end, and vtter it's voyce aloud in the
  gates of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. So God said vnto <hi>Cain,</hi> presuming that that
  fratricide of his, because it was done in secret, should haue beene buried for
  euer, and neuer haue come to light, <hi>If thou doe well, thou shalt be
  rewarded for it; if ill, sinne lieth at the doore.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen</hi> 4.</note> And when <hi>Cain</hi> made himselfe as if
  he had been ignorant what was become of his brother <hi>Abel</hi>; the Lord
  said vnto him, <hi>The voyce of thy brothers bloud crieth vnto mee from the
  earth:</hi> And in Scripture it is an ordinarie kind of language to say, That
  our sinnes doe crie out for vengeance. When one of <hi>Ioshuahs</hi> souldiers
  hid a wedge of gold, <hi>Nicholaas de Lyra</hi> noteth,<note place="margin">Sin,

  originall word signifieth likewise a Tongue; for though it were hid and buried
  vnder ground, yet did it crie out. <hi>Iob</hi> painteth forth the warinesse of
  an Adulterer, <hi>He waiteth for the twilight, and saith, No eye shal see me;
  and disguiseth his face</hi>; Like the Owle, he comes not abroad till it be
  darke night, he pluckes his hat downe in his eyes, he muffles his cloake about
  his face, he first lookes on this side, and then on that, lest any one should
  chance to espie him: In a word, such lewd liuers as these, like vnto your wilde
  beasts, keepe themselues close, watching for the darkenesse of the night:<note place="margin">

  bestiae agri, Thou makest darkenesse, and it is night, wherein all the beasts
  of the Forrest creepe forth</hi>; and so it is with these beastly minded men.
  <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> makes another kind of description thereof; A man breaketh
  Wedlocke, and thinketh thus in his heart, <hi>Who seeth me? I am compassed
  about with darkenesse,</hi>

                  <hi>the walls ouer mee, no bodie seeth mee, whom need I to feare?</hi> But the
  truth is, That Walls haue eyes as well as eares; besides, the eyes of the Lord
  are ten thousand times brighter than the Sunne, beholding all the wayes of men,
  the ground of the deepe, and the most secret parts. And this man that thinks
  himselfe so close and so cunning that no eye can find him out, shall bee
  punished in the streets of the Citie, and shall be chased like a young
  horse-Foale, and when hee thinketh not vpon it, he shall be taken: thus shall
  he be put to shame of euerie man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause hee would not vnderstand the feare
  of the Lord. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, That none seeke to carrie these
  kind of businesses more secretly and more cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly, than your married woman,
  that hath a care of her reputation and honor; but she also, for all her slie
  cariage, shall bee brought out into the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and examination shall
  bee made of her children; her children shall not take root, and her branches
  shall bring forth no fruit; a shameful report shal she leaue, and her reproch
  shall not bee put out. <hi>Salomon</hi> after hee had made mention of foure
  things that left no signe behind them, nor were to be traced out, or follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
  by the track; to wit, The way of an Eagle flying through the ayre; of a
  Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent gliding through the Rock; of a ship sailing through the sea; &amp; of
  the wayes of a young man in his youth; hee further addeth, <hi>Talis est via
  mulieris adulterae,</hi> The way of an Adulteresse may verie well be likened
  vnto these, for that great artifice and cunning wherewith she dissembleth this
  her treacherie, as being on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly priuie to this her foule play, and wiping her
  lips, she sits downe full gorged at her husbands boord, and tells him that shee
  will fast, contenting her selfe with bread and water; to the end that by this
  her fasting and leading a godly life, shee may gaine a good report, and be free
  from the razors of malicious tongues: but in the end, (as before we haue said)
  <hi>Nihil occultum quod non reueletur, Nothing so secret which shall not be
  reuealed.</hi> For Sinne euermore leaues a print behind it, like those
  footsteps of <hi>Baals</hi> Priests; those steps of our forefather
  <hi>Adam</hi>; that coare of the cut Apple that choaked all Mankind; and those
  crummes and reliques of their feastings, who said, <hi>Nulium sit pratum quod

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>xuria nostra, Let
  there be no meadows in which our ryot may not reuell.</hi> The Deuill, who
  assures vs most <pb n="416" facs="tcp:22083:222"/> of secrecie, takes off this cloake which
  he casteth ouer vs, and discloseth these our secret sinnes, when he hath a mind
  to open our shame. <hi>Dauid</hi> beeing a wise and discreet King, tooke
  extraordinarie care for the concealing of his adulterie; <hi>Forsitan tenebrae
  conculcabunt me, tu fecisti abscondite</hi>: hee carried the businesse so
  closely, that he thought it should not be discouered; but by those Letters that
  he wrote vnto the Generall of his Armie, That he should put <hi>Vrias</hi> in
  the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front of the battaile, and where the greatest danger of death was;
  <hi>Ioab</hi> smelt out <hi>Dauids</hi> drift, and shewed the Kings Letter to
  some of his Captaines; who did blaspheme God, for that he had set a King ouer
  them, who for to satisfie his lust, set so little by the life of so braue and
  valiant a Souldier, and so seruiceable as <hi>Vrias</hi> was, and so well
  deseruing of his Maiestie.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Sin cannot bee concealed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God.</note>The
  second, That though a sinne be kept secret from the eyes of men, yet is it not
  possible that it should bee hid from the all-seeing eye of God. <hi>The Sunne
  hath not so cleere an eye-sight as God hath</hi>; The Sunne pierceth into the
  bowells of the earth, it discouereth the bottome of the Deepe: in the one he
  hath certaine Shops or Worke-houses, wherein gold, siluer, and pretious stones
  are wrought; in the other, Pearle, and diuers other rich commodities, as
  Corall, Amber, and the like. But although the Sun reacheth to the vtmost
  corners of the earth, and the most hidden secret places of this Vniuerse, by
  his vertue and heat; yet are there many which he cannot come neere vnto with
  his light and splendor: but from the eyes of God there is not that veine or
  least crannie in the earth, nor that shell, though neuer so small in the sea,
  that can hide it selfe; <hi>Sicut tenebra eius, ita &amp; lumen eius, As the
  darkenesse is his, so is the light also.</hi> In that beginning when God
  created the World, he diuided the night from the day, and the light from
  darkenesse: but this was done for humane eyes; but to those diuiner eyes there
  is no night at all, and innumerable are those places of Scripture which prooue
  the truth hereof vnto vs.</p>
               <p>The third, That God many times affoords vs a greater fauour in
  publishing a secret sinne, than in letting it lie hid and reserued against the
  day of Wrath, for our eternall and publique confusion.<note place="margin">Sin
 while it is hid, more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to the Soule, than when it is
 dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered.</note> The Schoolemen make a question, Which is the more grieuous,
  the publique or the secret sinne? and it is a plain case, that the publique
  carries with it more grieuous circumstances of scandal, harme, and infection;
  and therefore <hi>Dauid</hi> stiles it a Plague or Pestilence: but the secret
  sin is always more dangerous, because it is in some sort incurable; there is no
  neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to admonish thee of it, no witnesse to denunciate against thee, nor
  no judge to punish thee for it, nor no Prelat to reprehend thee therefore; for
  sinne once reprehended in persons that haue any shame in them in the world,
  turnes to amendment. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> reports in his
  <hi>Confessions,</hi> That his mother had two Maid seruants, one a well growne
  wench, the other a little girle; and that when they went for Wine to the
  Tauerne, the bigger would drinke a good heartie draught, the lesser did but sip
  a little; but by sip after sip she grew by degrees to be a good proficient: and
  falling out one day before their mistresse, the bigger complained of the
  lesser, That she did drinke vp the Wine; whereof shee was so ashamed, that she
  would neuer after so much as offer to take it. Publique sins, all labour to
  amend: When a house is on fire, there is not that Tyler or Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or any
  neere dweller, but will hast in and helpe all they can to quench it. Secret
  sinnes are like a smokie fire, which lies smothering &amp; not flaming forth,
  wasts and consumes inwardly: and this is the cause that it is conserued and
  con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued like a secret Impostume, which occasioneth our death because it
  cannot be cured.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iosh</hi> 7.</note> Vpon <hi>Achans</hi>
  sinne they did cast lots by Tribes, by households, and <pb n="347" facs="tcp:22083:222"/>
  by particular persons; and when the Delinquent was discouered, <hi>Ios<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

  brought to light and made knowne to the world, and that thou shalt smart for it
  in this life; for had it beene kept secret, thy punishment had beene immortall.
  <hi>Dauids</hi> Adulterie being brought forth vpon the open stage, [<hi>In
  consp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>tu Solis huius</hi>] and
  <hi>Nathans</hi> reproouing him for it, was the future occasion of all his
  good. It could not chuse, to this adulterous wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that was thus taken in the
  manner [<hi>Con el hurto en las manos,</hi> with the theft, as they say, in her
  hand,] but be a wonderful griefe &amp; vexation, that shee should be carried
  publiquely through the streets, all the boyes of the Citie hooting at her, men
  and women poynting at her with the finger, and crying shame vpon her, and that
  at last she must be brought into the Temple, and there be set in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
  of that reuerend Auditorie and Assemblie, as a spectacle of shame and infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie.
  But the opening of this her wound, was the curing of it; this which shee
  thought was her ruine, was her remedie; &amp; this her marring was her making.
  The World held her to be a most vnhappie woman; for there being so many
  Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resses in the Citie, <hi>Whorings had ouerspread the land, and bloud had
  touched bloud</hi>; that this flash of lightning should light vpon her
  alone,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hose.</hi> 4.</note> and that this sudden
  thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-clap should not onely voyce her dishonour, but her death. Whereas the
  Adulterer was by all adiudged to be a happie and a fortunate man, that by good
  hap he had escaped out of the hands of Iustice, either by flight, or greasing
  the Officers in the fist. Others stickt not to say, <hi>Siempre quiebra la
  soga, por lomas del gado</hi>; the weakest still goes to the wall: howsoeuer,
  the more certaine truth is, That she was happie, and the Adulterer
  vnfortunate.</p>
               <p>The fourth, That euerie sinne is to bee made publique either in
  this present life, or in the life to come; and this sayth the aforesaid Letter,
  <hi>Nihil opertum quod non reueletur</hi>; and not onely publique notice to be
  taken thereof, but to bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied also with shame and confusion. And this
  the Scripture prooueth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs in many places; and for the amending of these
  two mischiefes there is no meanes so powerfull, as to haue recourse to
  repentance; from whence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed these two effects:</p>
               <p>The one, That it couers our sinnes, <hi>Blessed are they whose
  sinnes are forgiuen, and whose iniquities are couered.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The other, That it doth blot them out of Gods rememberance,
  according to that of <hi>Ezechiel, At what houre soeuer a Sinner shall repent
  him, I will no longer be mindfull of his sinne.</hi>

  The sinne of Adulterie is without all question of all other sinnes the

               <p>Secondly, Because God is the authour of marriage; God created
  man and woman, and being wedded each to other, he said, <hi>For this cause

                  <hi>The Sword shall

  thee to weigh well the word <hi>Me,</hi> who in the beginning of the world did
  authorise marriage; Me, who in the Law of Grace was personally present at my
  friends marriage, and there vnfolded the sailes of my Omnipotencie, working
  there and at that wedding my first miracle. S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, If the
  husband be of the houshold of the Faithfull, and the wife of the Vnfaithfull,
  <hi>non dimittat illam,</hi> let him not forsake her: but if she shall be
  vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfull to her husband,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.</note> he
  may lawfully then leaue her. So that God seemeth to be more offended, that she
  should not keep her faith toher husband, than that she should not professe the
  Faith of Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But this they said to tempt him.</hi> They put on a shew of

  concerning this point: but the truth was, that they went a fishing, to see if
  they could catch our Sauiour in some answer that he should giue them contrarie
  to the Law, to the end that they might accuse him as a Transgressour. The
  Scribes they were jealous of their Law, the Pharisees of their Religion; the
  one sought to picke a hole in his coat vpon some quirke and quiller of the Law;
  the other, for the wronging of their Religion: and therefore they said vnto
  him, Seeing thou art a Master, to whom it belongeth to expound our Lawes, and
  that thou takest vpon thee at euerie bout to vnfold <hi>Moses</hi> his meaning;
  <hi>Moses</hi> law commandeth, That such should bee stoned;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Leuit.</hi> 20. <hi>Deut.</hi> 22.</note> What sayst thou
  therefore? <hi>Euthimius</hi> saith, That they tooke our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Christ to be
  so mercifull a minded man, that they did well hope that hee would wrest and
  wind the Law which way he listed, if not vtterly ouerthrow it. And they did
  ground these their suspitions vpon some Sermons of his which he had preached,
  wherein he had deliuered to the People, That it was lawfull to cure the Sicke
  on the Sabboth day; which was a new kind of doctrine in their Law. Saint
  <hi>Gregorie</hi> and Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> doe both affirme, That they did

  eye of a seuere fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to a gracelesse sonne, so the austere looke of a King
  to his seruant that hath played the Traitor: how then shall Gods countenance
  skare vs, when hee shall looke askew vpon vs, and knit the brow of his heauie
  displeasure? When the Adultresse did behold her selfe in that Crystall Glasse,
  Christ Iesus, in whome there was no spot nor least specke of blemish in the
  world, and did see what a freckled soule she had of her owne, how foulely
  bespeckled with a loathsome morphew of this ouerspreading sinne; In what a

  him and to set him free; but in the apprehending of him, and the sentencing of
  him, let him be vpright and sound in that hee shall resolue vpon;

                  <hi>With his finger he wrote on the ground.</hi> All that
  comment vpon this place, do agree in this, That he wrote in this manner, and
  why he did it:</p>
               <p>And first of all, Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> saith, That hee wrote
  on the ground the sins of those that had accused this Adultresse: According to
  that of <hi>Ieremie, They that depart from thee shall be written in the
  earth;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ierem.</hi> 17.13.</note> their names shall
  not bee registred in the booke of Life: wherewith he left them confounded and
  ashamed, and did prooue thereby vnto them, that they had neither any zeale to
  the Law, nor any desire to obserue the same. This was a blazoning forth of the
  honour and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of our Sauiour Christ, beyond that of the Romans; here was a
  <hi>parcere subie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis</hi> to the purpose; and a <hi>debellare superbos</hi>
  with a witnesse. And whereas the Scribes and Pharisees set vpon him in this
  their pride and brauerie, when they saw their own sinnes set downe before their
  eyes (which to a Sinner is a terrible and most fearefull sight) they let fall
  their plumes, and hung downe their heads for shame, being so basely deiected,
  as none could be more. <hi>I will lay all thy abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations before thee</hi>;
  O, this is a sad and heauie spectacle, What humane eye can indure to behold
  them? especially when God shal raise vp our old sinnes, which we thought had
  beene forgotten and buried in the pit of obliuion. O, how true is that of
  <hi>Ieremie,</hi> and how pat to our present purpose, <hi>The yoke of my
  trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions is bound vpon his hand, they are wrapped and come vp about my
  necke.</hi> My heauie sinnes are continually before his eyes, as he that tieth
  a thing to his hand for a remembrance; the horrour whereof hath made my
  strength to fall. What a dismall thing is it, to see those my wickednesses
  which I thought had beene quite out of his remembrance, and that he had cast
  them behind his backe, to be brought before my face, and he to hold the
  beadroll of them in his hand, written in great capitall letters,
  <hi>Circumuoluta sunt in manu eius,</hi> like a piece of corke vnder a clew of
  thred. <hi>Esay</hi> paints forth certaine impudent and shamelesse Sinners, and
  presently anon after saith, <hi>Their destruction is written downe, and when I

  He calls these bitter things, the sinnes of his youth. Saint
  <hi>Chrysostome</hi> saith, That hee borro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed this metaphor from a Iudge, who
  takes the penne in his hand for to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce sentence, setting downe the
  offences of the Delinquent. And therfore <hi>Iob</hi> saith, I see that thou
  lookest narrowly vnto my paths, as though thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest pronounce sentence
  against mee. And therefore Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> saith, That Christ wrote on
  the ground. And as a Iudge exposeth a Butcher to publique shame, by hanging his
  false weights about his necke; so thou, ô Lord, hauing readie written in
  thy hand the yoke of my transgressions, thou exposest mee to shame, by wrapping
  them about my necke.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> sayth, that our sauiour wrote that which
  <hi>Ieremy</hi> prophecied of <hi>Ieconiah, Terra, terra, s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

 22.</note> 
                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And in one of his Epistles he sayth, Thou seest a
  moat in thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours eye, but not the beame that is in thine owne. A late
  Commentator hath this note hereupon, That our Sauior wrote downe the sinnes of
  this Adulteresse, <pb n="423" facs="tcp:22083:226"/> that he might see them satisfied;
  bearing himselfe like a pittifull Iudge, who freeth a poore debtor, but takes a
  note of the debt that is to bee payd; Wholly to forgiue the same, the party not
  beeing satisfied, could not stand well with his Iustice; and to condemne her
  wholly, could not sute well with his Mercie. And therefore he was bound to pay
  the debt for her. <hi>Supra dorsum meum fabricauerunt peccatores.</hi> Another
  letter sayes, <hi>Scripserunt.</hi> He entred into bond for vs all. But
  although it be most certain, that he wrote some letters, or some sentence,
  against the sinnes of these her accusers (and therefore the Greeke text sayth,
  <hi>Hoc digito scribebat in terra</hi>) yet what that was which hee then writ,
  there is no certaintie thereof. And it is a great <hi>indicium</hi> or token
  that they did not well vnderstand those Characters, because vpon that writing
  they did not depart and goe their way. But vpon those words which our Sauiour
  afterwards said vnto them, <hi>Qui sine peccato est, Let him that is without
  sinne,</hi> And presently thereupon the Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>list addeth, <hi>Audientes haec
  vnus post alium abijt, That hearing these things, they went their way one after
  the other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Saint <hi>Austen</hi> saith, That he wrote on the
  ground, for to signifie that the names of the Accusers were not writ in Heauen.
  Alluding vnto that which he said vnto his Disciples; <hi>Reioyce, because your
  names are written in heauen.</hi> Or, for to show that it was he himselfe,
  which with his own finger had writ the Law in those Tables of stone; and
  withall to intimate, that the new Law was not to bee written in ragged stone,
  but in fruitfull ground; not in the roughnesse of the Law, but in the softnesse
  of Grace. And Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> in the Epistle formerly alledged, doth in
  a manner repeat the verie same words. So that by all these cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, it
  plainely appeareth that hee noted them out to bee transgressours of the Law,
  and to bee such a kind of people that had not the feare of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their
  eyes, beeing neither iust in their Iudgements, nor mercifull in their
  Workes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Let him that is without sinne, &amp;c.</hi> He had recourse
  to the rigour of the Law, by condemning the Adulteresse to be stoned to death,
  which was an infamous kind of death, <hi>Achan, Naboth,</hi> those false Iudges
  that wronged <hi>Susanna,</hi> and good Saint <hi>Steuen</hi> suffered in this
  kind. He had recourse likewise vnto his mercy, by absoluing her of this her
  sinne. For their condemning of her to be stoned, who were faultie in the same
  kind themselues, was a kind of absoluing her. And this limitation (as Saint
  <hi>Cyrill</hi> hath obserued it) was iuridicall, and according vnto Law. For
  as she was to be stoned by the Law, so she was to be stoned according to the
  Law; <hi>But the Lawes doe not permit that the transgression of the Law, should
  bee righted by those that are transgressours of the Law.</hi> So that when our
  Sauiour sayd, <hi>Let him that is among you without sinne cast the first stone
  at her</hi>; hee vnderstood by sinne in that place, the sinne of Adulterie, for
  otherwise it had beene <hi>contrariam actionem intentare,</hi> and the
  reconuention had not beene so strong and forcible. When the Pharisees found
  fault with Christs Disciples for their not washing of their hands, he retorted
  their owne weapon vpon them with a <hi>Quare &amp; vos?</hi> And here treating
  with him touching this womans Adulterie, hee giues them this answere, <hi>Qui
  sine peccato est, &amp;c.</hi> Saint <hi>Austen</hi> makes a question, whether
  the Adulterer himselfe were there or no? And his resolution is, that the rest
  were there. So that in the Accusers there were two foule faults to be found,
  which are inexcusable.</p>
               <p>The one to let goe a Delinquent for particular interest, and
  priuate gaine, as wee read in the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> of <hi>Ptolomeus</hi> his
  freeing of <hi>Menelaus</hi> from his accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, notwithstanding he was the
  cause of all the mischiefe wherewith he was <pb n="424" facs="tcp:22083:227"/> charged, and
  a man that deserued death in the highest degree: the Text there say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that
  he was <hi>Vniuersae malitiae reus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The other, That they who should haue beene preseruers of the
  Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and maintainers of Iustice, should be the Caterpillars of the
  Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and the ouerthrowers of Iustice.</p>
               <p>And if any bodie shall aske me, how they being faultie
  themselues, should dare to accuse this woman of the same crime. Saint
  <hi>Austen</hi> in his Confessions renders this answere, <hi>Fortis inscriptio,
  quam nulla deleuit iniquitas.</hi> Though God hath pri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

  Consciences, the hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse of sinne; yet notwithstanding those many sinnes
  of our owne, wee will not forbeare to condemne other mens sinnes, though we be
  faultie of the same our selues. A Merchant apprehends a poore petty Theefe,
  brings him before a Iustice, and causes him to be whipt, not considering that
  himselfe is the greater Theefe of the two. <hi>Diogenes</hi> told the Iudges

  if I can ouerthrow his councell. Thither he hasted, and kneeling downe before

  God doth fauour thee; and I had rather worship the Sunne rising, than setting.
  Thy father is old, &amp;c. Notwithstanding all this, <hi>Absalon</hi> titted
  him in the teeth, saying, <hi>Is this thy loue to thy friend?</hi> Where it is
  to be noted, That though the Sonne had rebelled against his Father, yet it
  seemed ill vnto him, that a Seruant should bee false to his Master; <hi>Fortis

Kingdomes, the walles and bulwarkes of Cities, the hedges about a Vineyard, the

            <p>Secondly, The death of <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> made him leaue the
land, and put forth to sea, making a seperation betweene him and them: for when
God gets him gone from thy house or thy citie, thou art beaten out of doores
(as they say) with a cudgell; euen then doth a man go turning backe his head,
like a Hart that is hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and pursued by Hounds, neuer letting him to be at
rest, but chasing him with open mouth from place to place. God cannot absent
himselfe from his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, nor can his immensitie giue way to the vtter
abandoning of this goodly Fabricke, and wonderfull <hi>Machina</hi> of the
World: yet so great is the hatred which he beares to sinne, that he also
commands vs to get vs out of that Citie where Sinne doth raigne; signifying
thereby vnto vs, That if any thing can make him to absent himselfe from vs, it
is our sinnes. God had his house and his residence in Hierusalem; so sayes
<hi>Esay</hi>:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Esay</hi> 31.9.</note> God had his house
and his hearth there, as if hee had beene one of their fellow Citisens, and a
Towne dweller amongst them: but their abhominations made him to abandon that
place. <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiel</hi> saw the glorie of God how it went by degrees out of
the Temple, staying one while here, &amp; another while there, resting it selfe
now against this pillar, now that, till at last, <hi>The glorie of God was

               <hi>The great
abhominations that the House of Israell committeth here, causeth me to depart
from my Sanctuarie. Iosephus</hi> in his booke of the Warres of the Iewes
saith, That when <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Vespasian</hi> came and besieged
Hierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, the gates of the Temple flew wide open, in token that their sinnes
had thrust God out from thence. And <hi>Cornelius Tacitus</hi> addeth, That
they made a great noyse at their opening, in token of his loathnesse and
vnwillingnesse to leaue them: howbeit he spake like a Gentile, hauing reference
to the multitude of their owne gods. The Poets likewise haue feigned, That
Troyes vices were Troyes ruine, and had banished the gods from them; for had
they beene present with them, neither the fire that consumed their Citie, nor
all the power of the Gretians had beene able to haue done them the least harme
in the world: So says Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> in his bookes <hi>De Cinitate
Dei.</hi> The Syrians tied their gods to the Alters of their Temples, with
fetters and with chaines. And albeit Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> saith, That
they did vse them as they deserued, yet the intention and purpose of that
People was not to detaine them there as prisoners and malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, but onely
to haue them in safe keeping, and to make them sure from get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting away from

not <pb n="428" facs="tcp:22083:229"/> any fit place for to giue them entertainement, and
to make them to sit downe and eat. And our Sauior well witting that these his
followers were faint and wearie, he was willing to giue them a little ease
&amp; rest. The soule is a strong and able Spirit, immortall, incorruptible,
vnweariable, like vnto that of the Angells; but the bodie is weake, feeble, and
mortall: It had need in the midst of it's labour to rest it selfe, that it may
returne afresh thereunto. Mens bodies beeing like vnto yron tooles, which being
dull'd with working must be ground a new, that they may haue an edge set vpon
them, and performe their worke the better. In the Statua of
<hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> the Gold, the Siluer, and the Brasse were lasting
met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls; but the Clay was not so: And though the stone had not broken it, by
lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and little it would haue mouldred away of it selfe. <hi>Sambucus</hi>
made an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleme of this subiect. The bow cannot alwayes stand bent; nor the
treble string of a Viall stand still strained to it's highth: Birds cannot
alwayes flye, nor fishes swimme, beasts cannot continually labour, nor the eyes
watch, nor the feete walke, nor the earth, nor the plants thereof still affoord
vs fruit. In a word, <hi>Quod caret alterna requie, durabile non est.
Aristotle</hi> saith in his Problemes, That he that walketh vpon a plaine euen
ground is wearied more through that vnifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie of motion, than if he went vp
hill and downe hill, which doth giue a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ease vnto the ioynts and
muscles, &amp;c. In like manner, vniformitie of life is commonly wearisome and
tedious vnto vs, and there is no life which is wholly moulded after one
fashion, that is held happy, vnlesse it inioy some variety. Euen those
exercises which are most sauorie vnto vs, are (if wee doe nothing else) most
wearisome vnto vs. Eating, sleeping, hunting, and gaming, if wee continue them
long, how vnsauorie, and how vnpleasing are they vnto vs? And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of it
is, that our nature will by no meanes suffer and indure any continued exercise,
whether it be weightie, or light, but holds it a meere tyrannie, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame
crueltie. <hi>Ieremie</hi> doth complaine, for that in Babylon they did not
al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Captiue Israelites any time of rest: Our neckes are vnder
persecution, we are wearie and haue no rest. Saint <hi>Luke</hi> saith,
<hi>Oportet semper orare</hi>; Saint <hi>Paul, Sine intermissione

<hi>Semper,</hi> doth not implie a continuation of time, but a complying of our

Christ therefore, seeing his Disciples were wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and being sencible of his
owne wearinesse, when he sate downe to rest him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe by the Well of Sichar, he
was desirous that they should take their ease, and said vnto them, <hi>Come

hee that vndergoes so painefull an office as preaching, should vnbend the bow,
and rest himselfe a while; who onely rests himselfe the more that he may take
the more paines. Whence it is to be noted, that God is so franke and so
liberall, that the Rest that is taken to this end, God puts it to the same
account as his paines-taking, and rewards it as any other the best seruice that
he doth him. So doth Saint <hi>Basil</hi> expound that verse of <hi>Dauid, I
will alwayes giue thankes vnto the Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Psal.</hi>

               <hi>his praise shall bee in my mouth continually.</hi> Now
<hi>Dauids</hi> thankes giuing, and praising of the Lord, was not continuall;
For, he had his houres of sleeping, of eating, of conuersing with his friends
and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, and other his houres of recreation; but because those houres of
taking this his ease and rest, were directed to the better inabling him to
serue God, God accounts of them as if they had been continually imployed in his
seruice. True it is, that those houres of our rest and recreations, ought to
bee few, and short, a <hi>Requiescite pusillum, Rest a while.</hi> A short come
off. Let those that weild the <pb n="429" facs="tcp:22083:229"/> world, and their ministers
take their rest; but let them rest but a while, for if thou allowest thy selfe
eight houres to sleepe, sixe to play, and foure for to walke, thou robbest thy
obligation of it's true time, and makest those that are sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, to shed
teares. And this is contrarie to Christs doctrine, and condemnes it in thee,
when he sayth vnto thee, <hi>Requiescite pusillum, Rest a while:</hi> And here
will I also rest from further prosecuting of this point.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And a great multitude followed him.</hi> The Gospel sayth,
That the men that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him, reckoning those to bee men (which the
Scripture vsually so vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standeth) that are from twentie vpward, were to the
number of fiue thousand; S. <hi>Vincent Ferrar</hi> saith, That with women and
children, they were some fifteene or twentie thousand: neuer any Prince in the
world retyring himselfe into the Desert so well accompanied, and yet so all
alone; so well accompanied, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the multitude of the men; and so all
alone, because all or the most part of this people followed him either out of
necessitie, curiositie, or out of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice. All the Court doth attend and wait
vpon thee, because thou commandest all; but thou art neuer more alone, than
when thou hast most companie: for all those that accompanie thee, are not all
of thy companie; they goe not along with thee, but with themselues, following
thee not so much out of affection, as affectation, more to see thy miracles,
than to receiue thy instructions. The pled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of true friendship indeed, are,
to hazard a mans life for his friend, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dole with him in his miseries, and
to reioyce with him in his happinesse: but since wicked presumption (as
<hi>Ecclesiasticus</hi> speaketh) hath sprung vp to couer the earth with
deceit,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Eccles.</hi> 37.</note> and that priuat interest,
like the Iacke-Daw, hath only learned to prattle the language of loue, there is
no trust to be had in these pledges.<note place="margin">A true friend hard to

hast thou not seene, that when heauinesse remaineth vnto death, a companion and
friend hath bin turned to an enemie? There is some companion which in
prosperity reioyceth with his friend, but in the time of trouble is against
him: There is some companion again, that helpeth his friend for the bellies
sake, &amp; taketh vp the buckler against the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie; <hi>There are perhaps
some such, that dare, nay will not sticke to lay downe his life for a good
friend indeed:</hi> And there are some likewise, which for their own interest
wil hazard both goods and life, and all that they haue; but if they did thinke
they should faile of their ends, and that it should not turne to their greater
aduantage, they would not venture one farthing, though it were to saue thy
life. When <hi>Adoniah</hi> vsurped the Kingdome, and proclaimed himselfe
King,<note place="margin">3. <hi>Reg. cap.</hi> 1.</note> the Princes of the

prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall Captaines and Commanders, and most of the valiantest men of Warre,
as also <hi>Abiathar</hi> the High-Priest: In a word, the Clergie and the
Laitie were both mainly for him; and yet hauing all these on his side, he was
all alone. <hi>All the strength of the Armie was not with Adoniah</hi>: many
vnderstand this of the Kings Guard; but for our purpose, it may be better
vnderstood of all those who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest themselues to be <hi>Adoniahs</hi> f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

him, nor did not sticke so close vnto him as they made shew; for they did not
so much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect <hi>Adoniah,</hi> as their owne ends. The Kings sonnes thought
he would prooue their best brother; the Nobilitie, their best King;
<hi>Ioab,</hi> that hee would pardon his murdering of <hi>Amasa</hi> and
<hi>Abner,</hi> and that hee should hold his place of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall;
<hi>Abiathar,</hi> That he would not put him out of the Priesthood, though
there was I know what prophecied to the contrarie. But the proclaiming of
<hi>Salomon</hi> was no sooner heard, but they left one by one, and went their
wayes, till they had left him like a single proposition to stand alone by
himself, hauing no cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion <pb n="430" facs="tcp:22083:230"/> to make good his Title.
<hi>Seneca</hi> pressing this Argument, saith, Many Flyes come to the Honie,
many Wolues to the Sheepefold, many Ants to the Wheat; yet the flyes are no
friends to the honie, nor the wolues to the sheepe, nor the ants to the corne:
Nor art thou to esteeme those thy friends that accompanie thee, for they are no
better than flyes, wolues, and ants, which seeke not thee but themselues. And
if thou shouldst but heare, after they haue profest themselues thy friends,
fawn'd vpon thee with flattering tearmes, and vow'd what a deale of loue and
affection they beare vnto thee, what they talke of thee behind thy back, and
what they mutter and whisper of thee in by-corners, thou wouldst then see and
perceiue that all thy prosperitie, is the fable and common by-word of their
wrongs and discontents.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Because they saw his Miracles, which he did on them that were

            <p>First, for the furthering of our Faith, which depending vpon the
Will, comes by benefits to bee well affectioned thereunto, and to incline to
Knowledge and Vnderstanding.</p>
            <p>The other, To show by sencible signes, the end which caused him to
come into the world, which was to cure our Soules infirmities.</p>
            <p>The third, That it might appeare vnto Man, that the onely motiue
thereunto, was his Mercie.</p>
            <p>Now the Iewes did neither fixe their eyes, nor their thoughts vpon
any one of these; but onely vpon their owne proper ends. Either because hee
should heale them, or fill their bellies. And therefore, albeit some say, that
the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelist did set downe this reason, that he might thereby aduise vs,
that our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our was bound as it were to doe that he did, for these people
that followed him, yet I doe rather beleeue, that he set downe this passage, to
giue vs thereby to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand how vnobliged he stood to doe them this so great
a fauour, and how kind hee was of his owne accord, to those that did so ill
deserue any kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse at his hands. And therefore hee discouereth their

            <p>And therefore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>He did shut vp all in

sought rather after meat,<note place="margin">A true friend hard to be

vnto them elsewhere, <hi>Yee haue followed me because I haue filled your
bellies, and giuen you fulnesse of bread.</hi> For there are some people that
seeke after God for worldly blessings, and neuer thinke vpon him but in time of

when a greater conueniencie of gaine was offered vnto him,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iud.</hi> 18.</note> hee forgot the former, and thought
thereof no more: It is better for thee (sayd they) that thou shouldst bee a
Priest of a whole Tribe, than of one particular House. <hi>Philon</hi>
commenting vpon <hi>Cains</hi> answer vnto God, [the Seuentie rendering this
Translation, <hi>Si proijcis me à facie tua, à facie tua
abscondar, If thou cast me from off the face of the earth, let me be hid from
thy face</hi>] saith, That it was all one as if hee <pb n="431" facs="tcp:22083:230"/>
should haue said, If thou wilt not bestow vpon mee the blessings of the earth,
keepe those of heauen to thy selfe; if I may not enioy the pleasures &amp;
delights of this world, let vertue and goodnesse for me goe a begging, I care
not for it. Many make vse of God as they doe of a Felt, to defend them from the
Sunne and the raine, which heats and stormes being ouerpast, they hang it vp
against the wall; seruing God as many seruants serue their Masters, not so much
for loue, as gaine. And this ariseth from hence, that they know no other good
saue that which their sences set before them, and this is the marke whereat
they shoot.</p>
            <p>And hence it followeth, that in the predicament of those things
that are good, God of all other is the most disesteemed, and least accounted
of. According to that of Saint <hi>Augustine, Omnia diligimus, omnia amamus,
&amp; solus nobis vilis est Deus.</hi> For the good of this life, men will doe
much more than they will for God; they will goe I know not how many leagues,
some by sea, others by land, for these temporall respects, but will scarce
stirre a foot out of doores for Gods seruice. If they would but take halfe that
paines for their saluation, as they doe for their damnation, they would all of
them be Sainted in Heauen. Out of the pleasure that some take in hunting, they
care not whither they eat or no for two or three days together; but it goes
against their stomacks to fast but one day for Gods sake. Out of the delight
that some take in play, or in rounding the streets, they will scarce sleepe in
thirtie nights one after another; but will not watch one in humbling themselues
vpon their knees, and praying vnto God: For these worldly vanities they will
not sticke to impawne their whole estate, but it goes against the haire with
them, to spend so much as one poore Royall in Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice. Vpon a Prince, or
the Princes Fauourite, they will make no bones to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow some great and costly
Present, but grudge to offer vp to God a poore hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger-starued Lambe. Of these

one of the sences vpon that place is this, O Lord I haue onely offended thee,
against thee onely haue I sinned, thee onely haue I despised; I was careful
that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple might not come to the knowledge of this my sinne, and that it
might be hid from <hi>Vrias</hi> his house; I was more fearefull of mens eyes,

his Disciples, into a Barke, and that hee crost ouer to the Desert which was on
the other side of the Riuer, and the people that followed him taking notice of
the voyage that he was to make, whither it were <pb n="432" facs="tcp:22083:231"/> that
they wanted ship-room, or that the wind was against them, they ran on foot
thither out of all Cities, and came thither before him, waiting for his
comming. Our Sauiour being disimbarkt, went vp to the Mount, saying vnto his
Disciples, <hi>Rest a while.</hi> He went forth to see the people that followed
him, and when hee saw them, beeing mooued to pittie and compassion of them,
because they were like Sheepe that had no Sheepheard, hee entertained them with
much courtesie and kindnesse, and hauing instructed them in many things
concerning the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, he afterwards cured those that were sicke. And
when the day was now farre spent, his Disciples came vnto him, saying, This is
a desert place, and now the day is farre passed, therefore I pray you dismisse
them and let them depart, that they may goe into the Villages and Townes about,
and buy them bread, for they haue nothing to eat: but he answered and said vnto
them, It is better that yee should giue them to eat.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>When Iesus had lift vp his eyes.</hi> To behold one earnestly,
is a token of loue and care: and herein our Sauiour not onely shewed a token of
his affection, but also of his prouidence. That it is a signe of Loue,
<hi>Esther</hi> said vnto King <hi>Assuerus, If I haue found fauour in the

                  <hi>Esther.</hi> 5.</note> she did
take the eyes to bee the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiue of fauour; and therefore did petition him,
That he would entertaine her suit with the eyes of grace and fauour. The Prince

               <p>There was a time when God did put the repairing and remedying of

  field, nor cut the Vineyard.</hi> This was Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures feast of rest; obliging vs
  to lift vp our eyes to Heauen, and to beg of God our dayly bread. For too much
  plentie &amp; aboundance doth make vs oftentimes to abandon Gods prouidence,
  and to grow forgetfull of the care that he hath of vs. Out of the same reason
  he would not that the promised Land should be <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus rigatus,</hi> a watred

  looke for their water from Heauen: for in Aegypt, the power that they had to
  open at their pleasure the waters of Nilus, and to inrich their grounds
  therewith, was no small meanes to make them forget God.</p>

  remedying of our miseries was made ouer to his eyes; giuing vs thereby such
  good securitie, that to behold his eyes, and to be cured, is all one. The
  Fabricke of the Temple being ended, <hi>Salomon</hi> made a most deuout prayer

  Saint <hi>Augustine</hi>; fearing more her sorrow, if hee should not haue
  satisfied her longing, than the losse of Heauen, Earth, and God. Afterwards,
  God fearing the like frailtie in man, when he had shut vp that small remnant of
  mankind in the Arke, (which he was willing to free from the furie of the Flood)
  he shut it too, tooke away the key, and hung it at his owne gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle; doubting
  with himselfe, That if he had left it in <hi>Noahs</hi> hands, though hee were
  so good and holy a man as he was, it would not be safe in his keeping.</p>
               <p>Amongst other innumerable reasons, there are two that we may
  specially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie vpon, and confidently build vpon them:</p>
               <p>The one, That the eyes of Gods prouidence are still watching
  ouer vs, and taking care of our good. Saint <hi>Cyrill</hi> saith, That our
  Sauiour looking vpon this hungrie people, and that had followed him thus afoot,
  did represent Gods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding from the top of that high hill of his eternitie,
  all those things that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are, were, or shall be. For as <hi>Boaetius</hi>
  saith, <hi>Cunctorum, spectator est Deus, God o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersees all.</hi> Of men Saint
  <hi>Austen</hi> saith, That all that haue beene, or are in the world are poore
  beggars which eat of the crummes which fall from Gods Table; And as your poore
  wandring beggars which are almost hunger-starued, stand at the gates of a rich
  man that is a great almes giuer, with their scrips and pilgrime staues,
  expecting an almes; so all men both great and small, rich and poore, from the
  king to the beggar, stand waighting at this great House-keepers gate, looking
  for some releefe from him. Nor is there any man so rich, or so happy, that is
  not forced to be one of Gods beggars. And that Kingly Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi>
  saith the like of the beasts of the field in diuers places, The eyes of all
  waite vpon thee ô Lord,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Psal.</hi> 145.</note> and
  thou giuest them their meat in due season, Thou openest thy hand,<note place="margin">

  Rauens that call vpon him. By Cattell, hee vnderstandeth whatsoeuer beasts of
  the field: And by the Rauen, whatsoeuer fowle of the ayre. And hee did
  purposely and more particularly put here the Rauen, either because those old
  ones doe not acknowledge their young, for that they are white when they are
  hatcht, the damme and her mate beeing of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie colour: Or because it is
  such a rauening bird, that according to <hi>Ari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

  <hi>Chrysostome</hi> tells vs in a metaphoricall language, That in those
  im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mense spatious walkes in Heauen, there are other more beautifull fields,
  other <pb n="435" facs="tcp:22083:232"/> Fountaines, other Floures, other Groues, and that
  God doth sustaine and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine them all, <hi>All liue vnder his
  protection.</hi> Since then that all things liue so secure vnder his diuine
  prouidence, Why should man distrust, especially seeing that he hath an eye and
  a care to his wants and necessities; <hi>Who is like vnto the Lord our God, who
  dwelleth in the highest clouds, and yet doth behold from aboue, whatsoeuer is
  in heauen or in earth?</hi> The sight is not qualified by seeing great things,
  but by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing the least atomes or motes that are in the Sunne. In an
  Epistle which the glorious Apostle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> wrote to the Romans, he
  calleth God, the God of Hope; for he looking downe vpon vs doth inrich vs with
  such assured hopes, that we may hold them more firme and sure vnto vs, than any
  present possession of those lands or goods which we enioy.</p>
               <p>The second reason is, That if any thing can grieue Gods heart,
  it is our mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and necessitie; and therefore he makes such hast to helpe
  vs, as if it were his owne case; <hi>My sister, my Spouse, thou hast wounded my

  thy cares, especially when I see thee looke vpon me, are so many darts sticking
  in my heart. Abbot <hi>Guaricus</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing of the Prodigall, saith, That
  when his father saw him so ill accoutred, compassion did more strongly possesse
  him, than the passion of sorrow for his sins did his sonne. When
  <hi>Abraham</hi> was swallowed vp as it were with sorrow,<note place="margin">

  <hi>Vbi est victima, pater mi? My father, where is the Lambe for the burnt
  Offering?</hi> The Septuagint read <hi>Apparebit</hi>; the Tigurine,
  <hi>Videbitur.</hi> For God seeing vs suffer for his sake, is of it selfe a

  which God did discouer for that dearth which Israel indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,<note place="margin">3 <hi>Reg.</hi> 17.</note> and the care that he tooke in allaying

  <hi>Chrysostome</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Gods care to work his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
 to mercy</note> That this was a seuere reprehension of the Prophet
  <hi>Elias.</hi> That a Bird that hath no pittie of her owne brood, should take

  and spoyle of others, should be a Minister of mercie vnto thee: and thou that
  shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest haue been a mediator betwixt God and his people, shouldst be a
  prouoker of him to vengeance; he cries out against him, <hi>Absurdum est,
  ô Elias, Thou hast com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted a great absurditie, ô Elias.</hi>
  Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> further addeth, That the Rauen which heretofore shewed
  himselfe vnthankefull, in not returning again to <hi>Noahs</hi> Arke, is now so
  farre altred from that he was, that he brings thee bread and flesh, affoording
  thee thy dayly food; it had not been much for thee to haue expected an
  alteration likewise in the Children of Israell. <hi>Procopius</hi> tells vs,
  That the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen is an vncleane creature by the Law; and beeing that I, who was
  the Law-gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, did dispense that thou shouldest take thy food from him, Why

               <p>
                  <hi>And he entertained them kindly.</hi> The griefe which our

  Baptist,</hi> did not cause him to withdraw his sweet and comfortable
  countenance from others. For the mourning for the Iust, is not a hooding of the
  face to conceale our selues and our sorrow from the world; The Saints of God,
  lament the losse which the Earth sustaines by the taking away of the righteous
  from amongst vs, but not their death. For hee beholdeth not his death with the
  eyes of death, but quickely passes it ouer. It is the foole that thinkes all is
  ended with them in death. But it is nothing so.</p>

  pallace, will first aske counsel of his purse, how he shall bee able to

  vndergoe it. For, to goe out with tenne thousand against an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, that

  whence, and which way he shall leuie both men and money? For if it must bee
  from the bloud of the poore, that bloud which is thus wrung from them, is to
  draw the best bloud out of his owne bodie, to the indangering of his life, if
  not of his soule. Those Princes seldome or neuer thriue, who misseled by euill

  the beginning of the world vntil then,<note place="margin">Christ neuer commanded
 vs to sheare the sheepe, but to feede them</note> it was neuer propounded in
  any Princes Councell, how the Hungrie should be fed, or any care taken, how the
  Naked should be cloathed: But how to raise money for the Princes expences, for
  the more magnificent maintenance of his Maiestie, and for the vpholding of his
  Estate, this is euerie dayes example. And if the royal Patrimonie shall be
  impawned, there shall be sitting vpon sitting, proiect vpon proiect, how to
  bring him out of debt, &amp; to fill his Coffers, and all of them will put a
  helping hand to lay more and more burthens on the backes of the Poore; but
  whence the Poore should be fed, how your decayed Townes should bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired,
  how your ruined Commonwealths restored to their former honour and greatnes; let
  the great ones aduise vpon that, (if it stand not with the hurt of their
  greatnesse) for I can say little vnto it. Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> hath obserued,
  That our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Christ said thrice vnto <hi>Peter, Pasce Oues meas, Feed my
  Sheepe:</hi> but that hee neuer said vnto him, no not so much as once, That he
  should sheere them. Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying thereby, That it is the office of a good
  Prelat, to haue an especiall care that his Sheepe be well fed, both with
  spirituall and corporall food, and not to studie the raising of his Rents, the
  racking of his Tenants, nor his owne priuate profit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whence shall we buy bread.</hi> Our Sauiour Christ consulted
  with all his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples concerning this businesse. And therefore he sayd vnto
  them, <hi>Giue yee them to eate.</hi> And although the Disciples tooke care for
  the prouision of these things, they did not lift their eyes vp any higher, then
  to the distribution of their almes. But our Sauiour being willing to tax them
  for this their little faith, he would first make a verification of those few
  loafes that they had in their keeping. <hi>Quot pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes habetis, &amp;c. How
  many loaues haue yee?</hi> He began first with <hi>Philip,</hi> eyther per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
  because he was not present at what had passed; or because hee seemed to take
  the greatest care, how these should haue wherewithall to eate; or because he
  was lesse frugall and prouident than the rest (as Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi>
  noteth it;) or because he was not so quicke witted, and of that nimble
  apprehension as his fellowes, (as it seemeth to Saint <hi>Cyrill.</hi>) In
  conclusion, two necessities incoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring together; one of the body, another of
  the soule; one of bread, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of fayth; our Sauiour Christ began first
  with that of the soule, hauing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to that his office of a Sauiour, who
  made more reckoning of the more, than of the lesse.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Two hundred penny worth of bread is not sufficient for

  our Sauiours omnipotency, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing his eyes vpon his purse strings to see how
  strong they were: Whereas the blessed Virgin casting her eyes off from the
  Master of the feast, threw them on her sonnes omnipotencie. So short sighted is
  mans wisedome, that in seeing or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary meanes faile, he holds the relieuing of
  his wants desperate, not so much as once thinking what a thing it is to put our
  trust in God. And it is a fearefull thing to thinke, that man sinning, hopes
  that God will pardon him; and that suffering hunger and nakednes, God should
  not helpe him. Thou committest a mortall sinne, thou reckonest not much of it,
  hoping that God will be good vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, and forgiue thee thy trespasse; thou
  sufferest hunger and nakednesse, and yet despairest of comfort, fearing more to

               <p>Hence is it that thou hast recourse to euill meanes, for to free

  eyes, yet he left testimonies behind him, whereby they might know him; as by
  his preseruation of the world, his cheering of mans heart with food and
  gladnesse: and for this cause hee commands, That wee should beg our dayly bread
  of him. And as he onely can giue vs the Spiritual and Sacramental bread, so he
  onely can giue vs that materiall bread that must sustain our bodies, as that

                  <hi>There is a little boy here, which hath fiue barley loaues,
  and two fishes, But what are they among so many?</hi> Whether this were a boy
  belonging to the Apostolicall Colledge, (as it seemeth to <hi>Euthimius</hi>)
  or some boy of one of the Towns there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, as <hi>Chrysostome</hi> and
  <hi>Theodoret</hi> would inferre, I will not stand to dispute it: but it
  seemeth somewhat strange vnto me, That there was not any one man in all this
  Apostolical Colledge, which did not seek to rid their hands of this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or
  despaire of their being able to giue them entertainment. Some said,
  <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte eos, Send them away,</hi> dismisse them, what should they doe
  here? Saint <hi>Philip</hi> he comes in with <hi>Ducentorum denariorum, Two
  hundred penniworth of bread will not serue the turne.</hi> Saint <hi>Andrew,
  Quid inter tantos,</hi> What's a pound of butter amongst a kennell of hounds?
  What's this amongst so many? Onely our Sauiour Christ vseth them with a great
  deale of courtesie and ciuilitie, he onely fauours them, and is willing to bid
  them welcome. Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith, That if they had bin fiftie
  thousand, as they were but fiue thousand, they should all of them haue gone
  away satisfied and well contented. <hi>Iob</hi> saith, <hi>If I restrained the
  Poore of their desire, &amp;c.</hi> The multitude of the Poore did neuer cause
  feare in me, as being wel assured, that God hath enough in store for them. Now
  if man beare so braue a mind, because he is made after the image of God; What a
  noble mind must there be in God? In a couetous mans house there is too much
  penurie for the poore, but too much excesse for vanitie. When <hi>Nabal</hi>
  denied bread to <hi>Dauid</hi> and his souldiers, the Scripture saith, That hee
  had prouided a feast for a King. And the rich Glutton in the Gospell hauing his

  that fell from his Table. There are three things which my soule hateth; whereof

  rich man, a lier, vnderstandeth the vnmercifull man, who though he abound in
  wealth, still answers the Poore, <hi>No ay, I haue not for you</hi>; but the

  God,<note place="margin">Onely our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uior impoueri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed himselfe to make others
 rich.</note> to giue away the prouision of his owne Colledge. <hi>Seneca</hi>
  treating of the liberalitie which one man ought to vse towards another, saith,
  <hi>Dabo egenti, sed vt ipse non egeam; succurram perituro, sed vt ipse non
  peream; I will be mindfull of the Poore, but not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfull of my selfe; I
  will relieue him that is readie to perish, but will looke to it that I may not
  perish my selfe.</hi> For, What rich man did euer make himselfe poore to make a
  poore man rich? Onely our Sauiour Christ did so, <hi>When he was rich, hee made
  himselfe poore, that by his pouertie we might be made rich.</hi> To giue of our
  su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluities to the Poore, is a vertue; to part with part of that which doth
  not su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perabound, as the Widdow of Sarepta did, is more than a vertue; but to
  giue all away that is necessarie and needfull for a mans owne life, onely our
  Sauiour Christ did this. By whose example, many Saints afterwards became
  excellent Almoners; who were contented to suffer nakednesse and hunger
  themselues, that they might fill the bellie of the Hungrie, and cloath the
  backe of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked. And amongst the rest of these Worthies in their time,
  (whose memorie shall neuer be forgotten) verie memorable was that of
  <hi>Paulina</hi> Bishop of Nola, who to free another from slauerie, became a
  slaue himselfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Make the People sit downe.</hi> Saint <hi>Austen</hi> saith,
  That the circumstances made this miracle the more remarkable.</p>
               <p>First, it is the fashion of the World, to haue the meat set on
  the boord, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the guests sit downe. At that Feast which the King made at
  his sonnes wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, Behold, I haue prepared my dinner, myne Oxen,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.4.</note> and my Fatlings are kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and all
  things are readie, &amp;c.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ester</hi> 1.</note> King
  <hi>Assuerus</hi> made a great banquet for the Princes of his Kingdome, in the
  Court of the Garden and the Kings Pallace; but the Vigiles were farre longer
  than the Feast. But Gods Feasts haue no need of preuention or solemne
  preparation. God created the earth rich in hearbes and plants, before it
  inioyed the benefit of either Sun or Water, (as Saint <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome</hi>
  hath noted it) and therefore Christ had no need of Sunne or Water, to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
  and set forth a full table for man. He tooke all his Disciples opinions, and
  they all agreeing, that there was not bread sufficient for them, nor mony
  where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall to buy it; when they held it to be a desperate case, then did our
  Sauiour say vnto them, <hi>Cause the People therefore to sit downe.</hi> Where
  the word <hi>Therefore</hi> is to be considered. Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi>
  saith, That he went about to prooue by this <hi>Therefore,</hi> that which he
  afterwards said to the glorious Apostle Saint <hi>Paul, He calleth those things
  that are not, as though they were.</hi> In like manner, that which is not,
  heareth and obeyeth God, as though it were.</p>
               <p>The second circumstance is, That from so poore a prouision there
  should be so rich an ouerplus. In the feasts of this world, there is much
  remaining, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is much prouided, which doth commonly extend it selfe
  more to vanitie and ostentation, than necessitie. And that of much, much should
  be left, it is not much: But of a little, to make a great deale; God can onely
  doe it. Of much to make a little, is euery dayes practise; for your Cookes and
  Manciples know how to licke their owne fingers, and for the most part are all
  of them theeues, and vnfaithfull Ministers. But of a little to make much, is a
  Blazon that onely belongs vnto God: For (as Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith) he
  did feast this people, <hi>Non solum pro bonitate, sed pro potestate; Not onely
  out of his goodnesse, but also out of his power</hi>: For God was not here
  willing to expresse himselfe onely to be good, mercifull, and pittifull, but
  likewise to shew himselfe powerfull and liberall. <hi>Iosephs</hi> brethren
  seeing their sacks full of corne that before were emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and finding their
  moneyes in the mouthes of their sacks, they sayd one to <pb n="440" facs="tcp:22083:235"/>
  another; What Miracle is this that God hath wrought amongst vs? <hi>Ioseph</hi>
  was the man that did it, but they could not beleeue that such an extraordinary
  kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse could come from man, but from God. Men, when they fill their sackes
  with come, they empty their purses; But to fill the sacke and the purse too,
  that is onely proper vnto God.</p>
               <p>The third circumstance, is the order therein obserued: <hi>Per
  quinquagenos, &amp; centenos. They sate downe by rowes</hi> (saith S.
  <hi>Marke</hi>) <hi>by hundreds and by fifties.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in your great
  feasts now adayes, all is disorder and confusion. <hi>Homer</hi> saith, That
  when the guests be many, nothing can be fauourie, for commonly all is noyse and
  disorder for want of good gouernment. <hi>Plutarch</hi> reporteth, that the
  Emperour <hi>Paulus Aemilius</hi> was wont to say, That no lesse prudence was
  requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for the well ordering of a feast,<note place="margin">The Church why
 stiled a well ordered Armie.</note> where there are store of guests, than for
  to marshall a great Armie. The Holy Ghost stiles the Church, a well ordered
  Armie.</p>
               <p>The one in regard of it's beauty; for which it deserueth to be
  beloued.</p>
               <p>The other for it's order; for which it ought to be esteemed.</p>
               <p>In this feast there was good order taken for their sitting
  downe, as also for the equalitie in distribution of their fare. And where this
  <hi>decorum</hi> is kept, a little will suffice many, and where it is not, much
  will not suffice a few. Those hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses where this order is obserued, liue

                     </gap>pertate
  mea</hi> (saith he of himselfe) <hi>According to my pouertie,</hi> I haue laid
  vp such and such talents for the building of a Temple to the Lord: But because
  <hi>Dauid</hi> was a good husband, and liued in an orderly fashion, neuer any
  King bestowed so many and so rich re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vpon his Subjects as he did, nor was
  at greater charge when occasion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired it. For the materialls of the Temple
  he had disbursed a hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Talents of gold, and a million of Talents
  of siluer. He made shields of gold, he had gathered together a great masse of
  yron, and other mettalls, besides a world of wood; and yet when he died, left
  the patrimonie royall disimpaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, hauing in his Treasurie three thousand
  Talents of gold, and seuen thousand of siluer, which being reduced to our
  moneyes, would hardly come to be sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. <hi>Salomon</hi> was so rich a
  Prince, that all the garnish and seruice of his Pallace, and other his houses
  of pleasure, were of the finest and purest gold. And siluer, the Scripture
  saith,<note place="margin">Want oforder brings in all confusion.</note> was in no
  price or estimation in his time, being as common as the stones in the streetes.
  And yet, he hauing no warres, nor any forcible oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions of other
  extraordinary expences, layd taxe vpon taxe, and tribute vpon tribute vpon his
  subiects, and dying in the end very poore, he left the reuenewes of his Crowne
  so deepely indebted, that his sonne <hi>Rehoboam</hi> was inforced to impose
  new tributes and taxations, by which he came to loose ten parts of his
  Kingdome. The holy Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> noted this disorder in
  <hi>Eliakim</hi> King of <hi>Iuda,</hi> the sonne of <hi>Iosias,</hi> Thou
  alleadgest (saith hee) that the Maiestie Royall doth suffer want and
  necessitie; and that for this cause, thou oppressest the poore, the
  fatherlesse, and the widow. Thy father, was not he King as well as thou? Did
  not he maintaine the state and greatnesse of a King? Did he not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foord many
  fauours for the ease of his subiects? yet we doe not heare any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of
  his grinding of the faces of the poore, nor of his wringing and racking of his
  vassals.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Partiality in all things to be
 auoided.</note>The fourth circumstance, is the equalitie and fidelitie of his
  Ministers, for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they were but poore, yet did they not regard their
  priuate interest. For although many of the guestes were knowne vnto them, and
  that they had beene <pb n="441" facs="tcp:22083:235"/> particularly beholding vnto some of
  them, yet did they carry an euen hand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them all. The Ministers of
  Princes should be like vnto the stomacke, which doth equally and faithfully
  repart that which it receiueth, through all the parts of the bodie.
  <hi>Dauid,</hi> that regall Prophet, prints out the stampe of a perfect King;
  and one of the conditions is, That he should fix his eyes vpon Ministers that
  are faithfull, euen-handed, full of integritie, disinteressed and true both in
  their words and deeds. The gouernment of <hi>Traian</hi> was famoused
  throughout the world, for that he neuer suffered to be about him a lying
  Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, a couetous thiefe, nor any that dealt vnfaithfully; for from the
  Ministers vnfaithfulnesse, of force an ill name must fall vpon the King. And
  put case, that we must of force indure one of these two mischiefes, eyther a
  bad King, or bad Ministers, it were the lesse hurt, that the King should be
  bad. For the Ministers being the Kings hands to dispatch all businesses, they
  would amend what is amisse in his decrees and proclamations, and the like.</p>
               <p>The faults which in Ministers ought most to be shunned,<note place="margin">Ministers of State seldome good, if needy; if couetous,
 neuer.</note> and for which they ought most to be reprooued, is, to be poore
  and couetous. For all that is poore, and hath no good estate of his owne to
  trust to, will take away that which is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans, vnlesse the King shall
  giue him sufficient allowance for to maintaine him. And hence it is, that we
  see many Ministers, who entring into their office with fiue bare barly loaues,
  it seemeth vnto them that our Sauiour Christ hath made them dispencers of his
  bread, and that it is multiplyed by their hands, since that in so short a time
  they haue so many baskets ouer and aboue full of bread. When <hi>Ioshua</hi>
  made a partition of the land of promise, and euery man was to haue his portion
  proportioned forth vnto him, he layd out nothing for himselfe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting that
  the people should allot him out some conuenient share. For as
  <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deret</hi> hath noted vpon that place, Magistrates are not to treate
  of their owne par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular profits, but of the common good. The like noblenesse
  and faithfulnesse <hi>Philon</hi> hath noted in <hi>Ioseph,</hi> who being able
  (if he would) to haue interessed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in that immense masse of wealth,
  which by his industry did accrew to the patrimony royall, did not acquire to
  himselfe one single peny more than his stipe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary allowance from the King.
  There are some who are like vnto <hi>Bells</hi> Priests, who deuouring the
  Kings treasure, and feeding themselues fat with his wealth, make him beleeue,
  that the God <hi>Bell</hi> did eate vp all that which was brought in vnto them.
  The Spleene or Milt in mans body, is the stampe or Hieroglyph of these kind of
  people, which the fatter it growes, and the more it swels, the fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler and
  weaker are the rest of the members of the body.</p>
               <p>Lesse conuenient is that Minister which is couetous,<note place="margin">Couetousnesse neuer satisfied</note> for though he haue neuer so
  much, yet is he neuer satisfied. <hi>Valerius Maximus</hi> reporteth, That it
  was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded in the Senat of Rome, That two persons should be nominated to
  goe for Spaine against <hi>Viriatus,</hi> and the worthiest of the two to be
  made choice of; the one was <hi>Seruius Sulpitius</hi>; the other, the Consull
  <hi>Aurelius</hi>; and the Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors referring the choice to <hi>Aemilianus
  Scipio,</hi> to elect him whom hee thought fittest for that imployment; his
  answer vnto them was, I like of neither of them; for, <hi>Alter nihil habet,
  alteri nihil sat est, The one of them hath nothing, and to the other nothing is
  enough:</hi> not approouing the one, because hee was too poore; nor the other,
  because he was too couetous. Your full fed Flies are woont to bee lesse
  painefull to the wounds of the Poore, because their fulnesse hath it's bounds
  and termination. But this example is nothing to the purpose for your richer
  sort of Ministers; for your Flies, and so all other birds and beasts, haue
  their limits and bounds in their fulnesse, whereupon they rest and dwell, as
  the sea doth in the <pb n="442" facs="tcp:22083:236"/> sand: but your couetous men, the
  richer they are, the greedier they grow, and more hurtfull to the Commonwealth;
  for a poore Minister will content him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe with smal matters, but the rich
  Miser is insatiable. The Prodigall keeping hogs at a Farmhouse in the Country,
  suffered a strange &amp; raging kind of hunger, but when he could get no better
  food to satisfie the same, he was well content to take part with the Swine. The
  rich man in the Gospel had the world at wil, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted nothing, neither for his
  backe nor his bellie; <hi>Thou hast much goods</hi> (said hee of himselfe)
  <hi>laid vp for many yeares:</hi> but all this would not satisfie his
  insatiable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire; The Barnes are not big enough, &amp; my Granaries too
  little for my hunger, I will plucke them downe and make them bigger.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iesus tooke the Loaues, and when he had giuen thankes, he,
  &amp;c.</hi> It is first of all to be noted, That our Sauiour tooke the Loaues
  and the Fishes first into his owne sacred hands, that he might thereby shew
  himselfe to be the author of this mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous multiplication.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He did lift vp his eys vnto Heauen, in token that he
  had this power from Heauen.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, He gaue thankes vnto the father, as he was Man, because
  he was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to worke so great a miracle, for the spirituall and corporall
  good of man, which he accounted as a kindnesse done vnto himselfe.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, He did blesse the loaues and the fishes, giuing them
  the vertue and power of multiplication.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, The partition and diuision of them, he did put them into
  the hands of his Disciples, that they might diuide them amongst them, and
  minister them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. And all this was a type of the blessed Sacrament.</p>
               <p>He could haue as well created loaues and fishes anew, but then
  peraduenture the people would haue thought that God had sent them down from
  Heauen, as he did raine at the prayer of <hi>Elias,</hi> or Quailes in the
  Desert, or as Manna; and so they would haue diuerted their eyes &amp; their
  thoughts from the vertue of those diuine hands. And therefore it was fit &amp;
  conuenient, that he should adde an aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation vnto them, but not create
  them: as at the wedding he turned the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into wine, which he could (if he
  would) haue created anew. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, That this
  multiplication began in the hands of our Sauiour Christ; Saint
  <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> That it inlarged it selfe in the hands of the Apostles;
  Saint <hi>Hilarie,</hi> That it indured till it came to the hands of the
  Guests: The vertue was all one, but it extended it selfe to all, that the
  seruice might be the better performed, and the miracle made the more notorious
  and manifest.</p>
               <p>Our Sauiour Christ was willing that this multiplication should
  bee by the hands of his Apostles, for to fasten vpon all Clergiemen this
  liberalitie &amp; boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,<note place="margin">Clergie men ought to be
 li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall.</note> in distributing of bread, and doing almesdeeds. A Bishop puts
  on his Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificiall robes in the Church, and in the Church hee puts them off
  againe; and when he comes forth, his office is to inrich the widdow with his
  purse, and to spend his portion vpon Orphans and fatherlesse children.
  <hi>Iudas</hi> returned the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for which he sould his Sauiour, to the
  Temple, and the Priests entring into councell, What they should doe with it?
  they decreed, That it should bee spent vpon the Poore, because it was the price
  of the bloud of the High-Priest, who was the Father of the Poore. Saint
  <hi>Bernard</hi> saith, That the Priest that hath his part here vpon earth,
  must not looke for a part in Heauen; <hi>Si quid habuerit prater
  Deum,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Then God haue mercie vpon many.</note> 
                  <hi>pars
  eius, non erit Deus.</hi> Saint <hi>Cyril,</hi> That when Bishops seruants
  passe vp and downe the Streets, and enter into vnknowne houses, he that lookes
  vpon them ought to presume, That they go in there to seeke after the Poore to
  relieue <pb n="443" facs="tcp:22083:236"/> them. And Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> saith, That the
  Disciples presumed this of <hi>Iudas,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iob.</hi>
 13.</note> when our Sauiour said vnto him, <hi>Quod facis, fac
  citò.</hi> Many sticke not to say; I shall dye ere long, and then I will
  giue all vnto God. What an ill account do these men make (saith Saint
  <hi>Cirill?</hi>) All Clergie men haue to their heires those that are their
  enemies, who euery moment desire their death. And because their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie shall
  not haue it, they say; Let vs giue it vnto Christ. <hi>Nihil inuenerunt viri
  diuitiarum in manibus suis, The rich found nothing in their hands.</hi> Saint
  <hi>Augustine</hi> giues the reason, <hi>Quia nihil posuerunt in manibus
  Christi: Because they deposited no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the hands of Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They did all eate, and were satisfied. Eusebius
  Emisenus</hi> saith, That there was a very sauorie contention betweene fiue
  loaues and fiue thousand men, besides women and children; And that euery one
  did resolue to make an end of their peece of loafe and their fish, as well for
  to satisfie their hunger as for that it was so sauourie to the taste. And in
  that bread which they thought would haue beene but two bits a man, they had
  thirty, and the same imperceptibly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensibly increasing, those fiue
  loaues were too hard for those fiue thousand persons and their hunger.</p>
               <p>Our Sauiour Christ was herein desirous principally to prooue,
  That in his house, there are all sorts of dainties and fulnesse. The world
  seekes to disgrace Gods hospitalitie, and good house-keeping; alledging, that
  to be his friend, and to dye of hunger, is all one: And, that God is good for
  heauen, but not for earth: Because he doth interdict their pleasures and
  delights. This vniust cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of theirs, is repeated by many of the Prophets
  in the name of the cast-aways of this world. As <hi>Malachy</hi> for one; It is
  in vaine to serue God, and what profit is there in keeping his commandements?
  This is the scoffing and flouting of fooles, at those who serue God.
  <hi>Saturati sumus panibus</hi> (saith <hi>Ier.</hi>) <hi>&amp; benè
  nobis erat, &amp; malum non vidimus.</hi> The Hebrew hath it; <hi>Eramus boni,
  id est, foelices.</hi> The Prophet doth reprehend his people, That through
  their Idolatries they were come to those miseries of their captiuitie, and that
  if they did not labour to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend, he would lash them with sharper whips. And
  this stubborne people re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth; Nay rather, since we haue forsaken God, the
  world goes well with vs; for we eate and drinke, we are merry, sound and lusty,
  and happier than before. <hi>But since we left of sacrificing to the Moone, our
  life hath beene a continuall misery, and a perpetuall pouerty. Peccaui; quid
  mihi accidit trifte?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, God was willing to doe this for his owne honours sake,
  and for the good of those whom the world had deliuered vp into his hands
  hungrie, surbated, and sicke. All these he heales, all these he fils, and all
  these hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, to the end that it may remain as a registred and notorious
  truth, That God is a good God, both in heauen and on earth. When God did
  descend from the Mount to giue the Law, <hi>Exodus</hi> saith, The children of
  Israel saw God, and did eate and drinke: so that their seeing of God did not
  put them beside their eating and their drinking. And our Sauiour Christ said,
  That which enters in at the mouth, defiles not a man, And by <hi>Esay, My
  seruants shall eate and drinke, and be merry, and ye shall perish.</hi> Abbot
  <hi>Gilbertus</hi> saith, That the Prodigall forsaking his fathers house,
  entred into a stricter kind of order, where he had fasting enough, whereas in
  his fathers house, the very hindes, and meanest of his seruants had their
  bellies full of meate.</p>
               <p>The world is a Cosiner and a Cheater, it promiseth mountaines of

  but performeth molehills of nifles. Her prouision is on the one part very bad,

               <p>Besides, her prouision is so poore, that if she should giue all

  hungry. She gaue <hi>Salomon</hi> very much, &amp; it seemed vnto him, that all
  was but ayre that he had eaten, <hi>Vanitas vanitatum, &amp; omnia

  <hi>Midas,</hi> who was all his life time hungring after gold, and besought the
  gods, that whatsoeuer hee toucht might be turned into gold; and they granting
  his petition, hee perished through hunger, For his meate and his drinke turning
  it selfe into gold, his hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger increased ypon him, till it had wrought his

  another vpon a pale horse, and his name was Death. Who had power to aflict with
  hunger the foure quarters of the world. These were the horsemen on the one
  side; but there was heard from the other side, a loud voice, which sayd; A
  measure of Wheat for a pennie, and three measures of Barley for a penny. But
  yee that take part with the blacke horse, must not touch neither on the wine

               <p>First, for to discouer the vertue of Almes deedes, as Saint
  <hi>Cyrill</hi> obserueth it. Saint <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>

  <hi>Gregorie</hi> treats the verie selfe same Doctrine, vpon that place of
  <hi>Iob, If I despised him that passed by because hee was not cloathed.</hi>
  And Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> in a Sermon which he makes of Fasting, puts this
  difference betwixt paying that which thou owest, and giuing of almes to the
  Poore, to whom thou art not indebted; that the one is in profit of him that
  receiues it; the other in profit of him that giues. And therefore in Scripture
  Almes is called <hi>Benedictio, A Blessing,</hi> which is that which augments
  our wealth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Our Sauiour was willing that they should gather vp the
  fragments, to the end that the greatnesse of the miracle should be the more
  notorious, and that they should see of fiue loues twelue baskets full of what
  remained, besides that which they carried away in their bosomes, their sleeues,
  and their pockets, especially your women and your children. And howbeit some of
  them might keepe them as reliques of this so rare and strange a wonder, yet the
  diligence therein vsed might bee verie wise and deuout. Saint
  <hi>Chrysostome</hi> giues vs this note, That albeit this miracle ought to haue
  left a firme and assured confidence in euerie one of them, yet they were so
  wholly forgetfull thereof, that our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our was driuen afterward to put them
  in mind thereof,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. <hi>Marc.</hi> 8.</note>
  and taxe them of this their obliuion. There are other morall reasons giuen for
  it, writ by diuers vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this place, which I purposely omit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When the men had seene the miracle that Iesus did, said,
  This is of a truth the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet that should come into the world.</hi> They
  considering the greatnesse of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, but not so much <hi>potentiam,</hi>
  as <hi>qualitatem &amp; nouitatem,</hi> the power, as the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and noueltie
  thereof; they cried out, This is the Prophet whom the World expecteth. Saint
  <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, That greater is that miracle which God wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vpon
  the multiplication of their wheat haruest; but because it is so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, they
  make no great wonder of it. <hi>It is natural vnto vs more to admire new, than
  great things. Seneca</hi> treating in his Naturall Questions, of our
  extraordinarie co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets, which do so much amase the world, saith, That the
  Heauens, the Stars, the Planets, strike no admiration into vs, though it bee a
  meruailous and strange worke, because wee see it is so ordinarie with vs. The
  Sunne is the fairest Creature that euer God dispatched out of his hands
  [<hi>Vas admirabile, opus excelsi</hi>;] yet the beautie of it's beames doth
  not draw on any admiration; but it's Eclipses, because they are rare and
  seldome. So likewise in the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie and concord of the Heauens, their
  influences, and their Starres, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with their disposition, and the
  beautie of the Orbs; <hi>Knowest thou the course of Heauen? &amp;c.</hi> The
  Greekes expound this place, of the Clouds;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iob.</hi>
 38.</note> Who can declare the nature of the Clouds? Who, it's musicke and
  harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie? Who can make the musicke of the Thunder to cease, or stop the course
  of the Lightning? &amp;c. And all these, though they be such strange wonders,
  do not mooue vs to admire them; but vpon any change or alteration, wee stand
  astoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed at the noueltie thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When Iesus therefore perceiued that they would come and take
  him to make him a King, &amp;c.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Courteous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour is
 the greatest gaine.</note> Our Sauiour Christ had gained so much good loue and
  opinion amongst them by this his kindnesse that he had shewed toward them, that
  after the people were dismissed (as <hi>Euthimius</hi> hath obserued it) they
  determined to <pb n="446" facs="tcp:22083:238"/> make him their King, not onely offering
  him the Crowne, but seeking perforce to set the same on his head. And if the
  consideration of his miracles had beene the occasion thereof, they could not
  haue taken a more discreet resolution; and not onely they, but all the world
  had a great deale of reason to put their helping hand thereunto.</p>
               <p>For first of all, he is painted forth to be so wise, that all
  Ierusalem was strucken dumbe at the wisedome of his words.<note place="margin">Fit qualities for a King.</note>

               <p>Secondly, Hee was as faire and beautifull to see to, as the
  Sunne in all his glorie.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, He was of that force and power, that he did driue out
  of his temple with whips and scourges, the greatest power of the world.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, He was so open handed, so liberall, and so bountifull,
  that with fiue Loaues and two Fishes, hee did fill the bellies of fifteene or
  twentie thousand persons.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, He loued man so well, that for his sake hee willingly
  layd downe his life, and offered vp his most pretious bodie and bloud vpon the
  Crosse. So that there beeing so many strong and forcible reasons to draw vs to
  loue him, Who would not willingly make choice of him to be their King? But let
  vs that are Christians, acknowledge him to be our King, and shew our selues so
  louing and obedient vnto him, that we seruing him in holinesse and truenesse of
  life, and wholly relying vpon his loue and fauour towards vs, may come at the
  last to be heires of that his heauenly Kingdome. Which God grant for his
  mercies sake.</p>

their own greater gaine, had their Cattell and their moneys there in a

Now then, if a Priest being partly apparrelled in linnen, and partly annoynted
with oyle, shall draw neere vnto this fire, he had need be very 
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:22083:239"/> circumspect and carefull, that not so much as the least
sparke thereof light vpon him. <hi>Paulus Scaliger</hi> saith; That the
Antients painting forth a Priest, place in one of his hands, a diall or
marriners compasse, and in the other the sunne. The compasse, to shew, that he
should be the loadstone of the Common wealth. The sunne, that he might giue
such cleere light, that no tongue might be able to taxe him: That they might
make good that saying of <hi>Pythagoras; Aduersus solem ne lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaris.</hi> And
because the clouds of the earth should not darken the purenesse of their light,
God did ordaine, that in the land of Promise, those of the tribe of
<hi>Leui,</hi> to whom the Priesthood did appertaine, should haue no
inheritance allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto them. Who then (will you say) shall find them foode

<hi>Pelusiota</hi> saith) as a Mediatour betwixt God and man, being bound to
serue and honour the one, and to correct, and instruct the other. And therefore
this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor saith, That the Priest ought to be all eyes, and onely blind to
Couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. But many haue turned their eyes into nayles, to scratch and
scrape toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a great deale of wealth. <hi>Iudas</hi> out of couetousnesse
sold the Sauiour of the world. And would to God he had stayed there. But when
he returned the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to the Temple, he recommended couetousnesse to the
Priests, and making them heires of all that he had, he left nothing for
himselfe, (as the Bishop of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stia hath obserued) but a halter to hang
himselfe.</p>
            <p>Hence it commeth to passe, that the first step of a Priest, is
Couetousnesse, and euen the first desire, wherewith he entreth into those
sacred Orders. And when he gets in by this dore, you may giue him for lost, and
count him the child o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

colour of Holinesse, and seruice of God. And to make of scandalls, seruices;
Gods breast could not brooke it. It is the common fashion of the world to
dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guise a lye, with an apparence of truth, and to dawbe vice with the colour
of vertue; These are the ordinary impostures of Hypocrisie. But some hold them
to be so hurtfull, that if they should be suffered and borne withall any long
time, the world would be vtterly vndone by it. That a woman should dissemble
her euill feature, and the fowlenes of her skin, with rich and well made
clothes, and with borrowed colours, and that her beauty being not her owne, but
a falshood and lye from the head to the foot; she should make it to appeare as
a truth: That a Merchant should carry the name of a very rich and wealthy man,
though he owe a great deale more than he is worth: That a Huckster should sell
Barajas Oliues for those of Seuill, &amp;c. Let it passe, <hi>Mundus in maligno
positus est: It is a naughty world.</hi> But that an Apothecary should put vpon
a boxe of poyson, a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulo, or written Scroll of wholesome physick, and say
rats bane is sugar, it is not a thing to be indured. Lesse are we to suffer
deceits in the medicins and confecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for the soule. He that should haue
seen the beasts, the birds, the boords, &amp; the store of money that was
there, and the great noyse of the sacrifices that were there to be made, would
haue thought it had beene the Priests zeale, diuine worship, a relieuing of the
poore, and an easing of those that came a farre off to <pb n="450" facs="tcp:22083:240"/>
the Temple<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they might with the lesse trouble performe their
deuotions, but all this was nothing but couetousnesse, and their greedy desire
of greater gaines. And perhaps for this reason, Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> called it
the Passeouer of the Iewes. <hi>Erat proximum, Pascha Iudaeorum, The Iewes
Passeouer was at hand.</hi> Not my Passeouer, but yours; where you doe not

they were so in themselues, but because theirayme was their owne priuate
Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, which is no better than a dunghill in the sight of God.</p>
            <p>The third occasion, was their disrespect to the Temple; where God
euer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, that his Maiestie should be more especially respected.
<hi>Regna<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

respected throughout the whole iurisdiction of his Crowne, but much more where
he hath his throane and chaire of Estate. God, as he is King of Kings, and Lord
of Lords ouer all the nations of the earth, ought much to be respected; but
more especially, where he hath his throane in euery one of his Kingdomes. In
heauen, at the right hand of his father, which is the supreame throane of his
greatnesse and Maiestie. In the Synagogue he had the Propitiatorie; and in the
Temples,<note place="margin">

When the Angell appeared vnto <hi>Ioshua</hi> with a drawne sword, and
commanded him to put his shooes from off his feet, diuerse graue Doctors doe
concurre in this, that this Angell was the Sonne of God, as hee had before
appeared vnto <hi>Moses</hi> in the bush, commanding him the like. Wherein he
notified two things vnto them:</p>
            <p>The one; the reuerence that they ought to beare to that place,
where he did so especially manifest himselfe; <hi>For the ground wherein thou
standest is holy ground.</hi> By our feete, are meant our affections; by our
shooes, our cares. And many nations tooke from thence the putting off of their
shooes, when they entred into the Temple.</p>
            <p>The other; That against those, who should loose this respect to
that place, the sword was drawne to slay them, and fire prepared to burne and
consume them. <hi>Ezechiel</hi> painting out the abhominations of the Temple,
saith; <hi>Behold there came sixe from the way of the vpper gate, which looketh
towards the North, and euerie one of them had, Vasa interfectionis, the vessels
of slaughter in his hand.</hi> The 70 translate it, <hi>Septem secures, Seuen
hatchets.</hi> It is <hi>Theodorets</hi> obseruation, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all
<hi>Zenacharibs</hi> Armie, God sent forth but one Angell onely; but against
the prophaners of his Temple, six, according to the number of the dayes of the
Week: because there should not that day passe ouer their head, wherin some new
Executioner or other, should not but rise vp to torment them. <hi>In
multitudine misericordiae tuae introibo in domum tuam, adorabo ad Templum
sanctum tuum in timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re tuo. Caietan</hi> reades it, <hi>In multitudine gratiae
tuae.</hi> He that is predestinated to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, hath that respect to Gods
house, that if hee did not persuade himselfe that he stood in his grace and
fauour, he would not dare to presume to put his foot within the doores thereof:
and should he presume so to do, he would leane himselfe against the corner of
the first pillar he came at, not daring (like the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican) to lift vp his
eyes. But your Pharasaicall Hypocrite makes as bold with gods house as with his
owne: He lies here and lies there; sweares here and swears there; murmures here
and murmures there; he liues there as if there were no God; and liues here as
if God did not see him. And that which causeth the more feare and horror is,
That many times they meet at the Church for to <pb n="451" facs="tcp:22083:240"/> treat and
talke of their greatest villanies. Saint <hi>Ierome</hi> against
<hi>Vigilancius</hi> saith, <hi>Confiteor timorem meum, I confesse my
feare.</hi> When entring into the Temple of the Martyrs, I conceiue any anger
or euill thought in my mind; or when sleeping I haue had any euill dreame, it
makes my body and soule to tremble: Now then, when entring into Gods house, I
quake and tremble when I am to receiue, what can I doe withall? By
<hi>Ezechiell,</hi> God complaines of those rich men that built their houses
neere vnto his, <hi>Qui fabricati sunt limen suum iuxta limen meum.</hi>
Ioyning wall to wall to my house, they haue prophaned my name with their
abhominations, <hi>And I consumed them in my wrath.</hi> Being then, that God
cannot indure such bad neighbourhood, Wil he beare with those impudencies that
as it were in despight, ye doe before his face? Saint <hi>Ierome</hi> hath
noted vpon <hi>Esay,</hi> that amongst other things that <hi>Salomon</hi>
offended God in, one was, That hee had built vp such a high Turret in his
pallace, that it ouertopt the Temple, and did ouerlooke it. For Gods house
ought not to be inferiour to mans; What shal we say then to those that make it
a den of theeues?</p>
            <p>It hath beene obserued, That all those great and powerfull Princes
which haue presumed to presse into Gods Temples, haue come to an euill end.

                  </gap>it me, The zeale of thy House hath deuoured me, or eaten me
vp.</hi> Where it is to be noted, That it is one thing to eat and feed vpon the
zeale of Gods House, and his seruice; and another thing, to be eaten of it: one
while there is an Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall; another while a secular Iudge, which is
verie diligent in his office, out of the hatred that he hath to Delinquents,
and hee is held to bee a verie zealous man. But hee eats, growes fat, and
waxeth rich with this his zeale; and such a one eats of the zeale of the house
of God, but is not eaten of it. But there are others that are dried vp and
consumed of the zeale which they beare to the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of God; [<hi>Tabescere
me fecit zelus meus</hi>] who wasting their wealth, their health, and their
liues in this their zeale, doe more resent the wrongs that are done to God,
than those that are offered to themselues. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Quis
scandalizatur, &amp; ego non vror?</hi> Which made Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi>
to say, That of six hundred thousand miracles, one cannot bee found that may
bee compared with this his zeale: his owne tribulations and torments, he calls
them Glorie; and the offences done vnto God, he calls Fire, which burnes him.
Lo here a miracle, a strange kind of zeale.</p>
            <p>Zeale is the Child of Loue; but it is somewhat more inflamed, and
more pure than Loue. To Loue we attribute two powerfull effects:</p>
            <p>The one,<note place="margin">Loue and zeale wherein
  different.</note> That it is the authour of the greatest acts and noblest
exployts that man can performe. <hi>Esay</hi> in his ninth Chapter maketh an
enumeration of Gods greatest acts, <hi>To vs a Child is borne, to vs a sonne is
giuen, the gouernment is vpon his shoulder<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c.</hi> And for an vpshot
of these his glorious acts, he addeth this, <hi>Zelus Domini exercituum faciet
hoc, The zeale of the Lord of Hosts shall doe this.</hi> Amongst Gods
attributes, we consider a celestiall competencie in the greatest mysteries of
his life, and of his death; but in the end, Loue gets the victorie and glory of
the day.</p>
            <p>The second effect of Loue is, To conuert it selfe wholly to the
seruice of the thing beloued. He that is enamoured of God, will willingly
pardon the iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries that are done to himselfe; but those that are offered to
God, hee will neuer forgiue. And <hi>Ecclesiasticus</hi> renders the reason of
it; <hi>Cognoui quod in multa scientia, <pb n="452" facs="tcp:22083:241"/> multa sit
indignatio,</hi> He that hath little knowledge of God, finds himselfe but
lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle offended, when the Maiestie of God is wronged and abused; but hee that
knowes much, is much offended, when offence is offered to the partie he loues.
A little child is neuer offended at vice or vicious men: <hi>Cum essem
parvulus, sapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ebam vt parvulus</hi>; but a well growne man, will like
<hi>Mathias,</hi> kill an Idolator, or like <hi>Phineas,</hi> slay a
fornicator, and set vpon a blasphemer, &amp;c. or vpon a whole ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, like
<hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Leui.</hi>

                     </gap>ts here, more in shew than substance</note>
                  <hi>He made
  as it were a whip.</hi> For the chasticements of God in this life, seeme to be
  whips and scourges, but they are not; <hi>Quasi morientes, &amp; ecce
  viuimus.</hi> No like, is the same; &amp; that which is as it were such a
  thing, is not the thing it selfe. Our life seemeth to be death, but it is not
  death; our portion pouertie, but it is not so; <hi>Sicut egentes, multos autem
  locupletantes.</hi> There are three reasons of this Truth:</p>
               <p>The one, That these whips come short of those scourges at the
  day of Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which will be most fearefull and most terrible. Saint
  <hi>Mathew</hi> cals them but the beginning of sorrowes, <hi>Ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

  are not sorrowes,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.</note> which are so soone
  ended. Of <hi>Antiochus</hi> his cruelties, whose souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers slew in three
  dayes fourescore thousand persons, captiuated fortie thousand, and sould as
  many more for slaues, not pardoning either old men, women, or children; the
  Text saith, <hi>Propter peccata, &amp;c. For the sinnes of those that inhabited
  the Citie, God was a little angrie.</hi> Of those cruell torments which the
  Martyrs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured, being fried, roasted, broyled, dragged, quartered, and sawne
  in sunder; <hi>Wisedome</hi> saith,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Wisd</hi> 3.5.</note>
                  <hi>They are punished in few things, but in many things shall they be wel
  re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another reason, Because these whips are not directed to our hurt
  and perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but for our amendment; as <hi>Iudith</hi> said in the siege of
  Bethulia, <hi>Haec ipsa sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicia, non ad perditionem, sed ad emendationem
  euenisse credamus.</hi> They are the whips of a father, that will not kill his
  sonne, but correct and amend him. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Dauid</hi> calls this
  whip, <hi>Virgam Directionis, The rod of Direction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third and last, Because whips and scourges are perforce;
  for, to giue one a stripe or a lash, you must perforce hold the whip in your
  hand, and straine your selfe thereunto. And therefore it is said, <hi>Cum
  fecisset quasi flagellum.</hi> Christ had neuer a whip about him, the Merchants
  themselues put it into his hands. <hi>Seneca</hi> saith, That the nature of the
  gods are so farre from anger either towards others, or in themselues; and of
  that goodnesse, clemencie, louingnesse, and peaceable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, that if they
  stretch out their arme, or lift vp their hand to punish you, you your selues
  must force and driue them thereunto by your sinnes and offences. And therefore
  <hi>Esay</hi> saith, <hi>Indignatio non est mihi, Quis mihi dabit Spinam &amp;
  Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prem?</hi> Saint <hi>Hierome,</hi> My People will not beleeue that I can be
  angrie, they take me to be so good &amp; so louing, that they cannot presume
  that any anger can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from my brest; Who will furnish me with a Thorne or
  a Bramble, that I may make my People to feare me? <hi>Iob</hi> treating of the
  Deuill, said, <hi>Ipse est princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pium viarum Dei,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iob</hi> 40.</note> 
                  <hi>He is the chiefe of the wayes of
  God.</hi> Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> saith vpon this place, That God hath two
  wayes:</p>
               <p>The one of mercie.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">God hath two wayes, one of iustice, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
 of mercy.</note> The other of justice.</p>
               <p>The former is mentioned by <hi>Dauid, Vniuersae viae Domini,
  misericordia, &amp; veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas; All the wayes of God, are Mercy and Truth.</hi>
  God was Author of the first, by <pb n="453" facs="tcp:22083:241"/> creating man in
  Paradise, for to translate him from thence to heauen. But the diuell running a
  contrary course, gaue the first beginning to the way of Iustice. For if there
  had beene no fault, there had beene no punishment. Two things <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaz</hi>
  told <hi>Iob,</hi> when he came to comfort him:</p>
               <p>The one; That God was neuer Authour of the death of the
  righteous.</p>
               <p>The other; That many sinners perished at the breath of his
  nostrills.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quin potius inueni multos, flante deo perijsse.</hi> Where,
  by the way, Saint <hi>Gregorie</hi> hath noted, That for to breath, outward
  ayre is necessarie; the ayre must bee without; so that thou art he, that makest
  thine owne rod, and that prouidest ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terialls for God. According to that of
  <hi>Solomon,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Prou.</hi> 5.</note> 
                  <hi>His owne
  iniquities shall take the wicked himselfe, and he shall be holden with the
  cords of his owne sinne.</hi> The gluttonie made the whip for thy gout; thy
  vncleannesse, for thy pocks; thy sweates and colds, for thy sciatica; thy
  paintings, for thy Megrims in the head, thy wrinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les in thy forehead, and the
  stinkingnesse of thy breath; thy Couetousnesse, for thy insatiable and
  vnquenchable thirst; and thy ambition, for thy continuall tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The King of

                  <hi>I will produce a

  and ambition shall be the twigs that shall make a rod to lash thee.</p>
               <p>And from hence we may collect these two things.</p>
               <p>The one, That for God to make an end of a sinner, neither
  thunders,<note place="margin">God needs no weapons to destroy the wicked.</note>
  nor lightnings, nor earth-quakes are necessarie; but that the breath of his
  mouth, or the twinckling of his eye, is sufficient. In thered sea he did turne
  but his eye vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and presently ouerturned all his Charriots.
  That which is to be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, is that hand wherein the whip is: A hempen cord is
  more to bee feared in the hand of a valiant man, than a dagger in the hand of a
  child. <hi>Miseremini mei, miseremini mei, sal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>vos amici mei, quia monaus Domini tetigit me. Iob</hi> called all
  his stripes, The touch of Gods hand; and this is that which ought to be
  feared.</p>
               <p>The other, is the whip of Hell, those here are but gentle
  stripes, and short; but those in Hell full of torment, and more heauie.</p>
               <p>First, for that the latter are eternal, <hi>A fire is kindled in
  my rage, and it shall burne, euen to the lowest hell.</hi> So that a worse
  miserie cannot be imagined. Our Sauiour Christ said to <hi>Magdalen; Optimam
  partem elegit sibi Maria, Mary hath chosen the better part</hi>; And the reason
  was, <hi>Non auferetur ab ea in aternum, It shall conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue with her for
  euer.</hi> But of the damned we may say, <hi>Pessimam partem elegit,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">All paines but pastimes to those of hell.</note> 
                  <hi>Hee hath
  chosen the worser part,</hi> for that his torment shall indure for euer.</p>
               <p>Secondly; for that the former are more gentle. For there is no
  paine in this life, which hath not some declination: And therefore your
  sorrowes vpon earth are compared to riuers that ebbe and flowe. But Hell is
  like a standing poole, that is alwaies at one and the same stay. And therefore
  it is said in the <hi>Apocalips, Death and Hell were cast into the lake of
  fire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Take these things hence, make not my fathers house, a house
  of merchandize, &amp;c.</hi> Twice (as it is obserued by Saint
  <hi>Augustine</hi>) did our Sauiour Christ worke this myracle.</p>
               <p>The first; when he first began to preach.</p>
               <p>The second; towards the time of his passion.</p>
               <p>Of the first; Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> onely makes mention.</p>
               <p>Of the second; the rest of the Euangelists.</p>
               <p>And albeit the circumstances of the doing therof were not one
  and the same, yet the occasions were both alike. So that if we shall summe them
  vp both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether <pb n="454" facs="tcp:22083:242"/> wee shall see in our Sauiour Christ
  the print or stampe of a most perfect Prince, who proceeded with exceeding
  great equallitie, without accepting of persons, or any other partialitie in the
  world. Not permitting that either ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, loue, feare, or his owne priuate
  interest (which, according to <hi>Isidore</hi>) are those foure enemies to
  Iustice) should make the beame of the ballance to sway awrie.</p>
               <p>There is not any businesse of greater difficultie in the world,
  than to gouerne, it is the Art of Arts; and the Science of Sciences; not onely,

                  </gap>rious dispositions, is a thing as it were impossible, so
  in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrutable a thing is the heart of man: but also, for that man amongst all
  other creatures is the most vngratefull, and forgetfull. In that pretension of
  the Priesthood, there was great debate and contention amongst Gods people; for
  the better according whereof, and to appease this tumult, God commanded, that
  euery one should put a rod or wand into the Tabernacle, and that which they
  should find to be budded forth the next morning, he whose it was, should enioy
  that dignitie. And in the end, there was but one onely rod that was bud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.

  acknowledgement of a common be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit should be common: but to gouern with
  perfection, &amp; for the budding forth of such faire flowers, it is enough, if
  amongst many there be but one to be found. For this is a white crow, a blacke
  swan, &amp;c. And it was fit that the person of our Sauiour Christ should be a
  patterne and example which they should looke vpon and imitate, who gouerne the
  world; to the end, that though they do not attaine to the perfection of
  gouernment, nor reach to the true height thereof; yet at least, they may loue
  it and desire the same; according to that of <hi>Wisd. Loue iustice, ye that
  iudge the earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Many things may he that gouernes, draw from this patterne.</p>

  of the Priests would not make to turne cow. And here our Sauiour Christ with a

  confounded. The Scripture blazons out the noble deeds of <hi>Dauid,</hi> and

  hauing a speare in his hand, and the other but a staffe, <hi>Virum dignum

  acts; but none of them came neere to that of <hi>Sampson,</hi> who with the
  iawe-bone of an asse, did set vpon three thousand armed Philistims which came
  to take him, &amp; slew a thousand of them. God had famous Captains amongst his
  people, who with celestiall fury did set vpon his enemies, killed men of
  moustrous might and stature, and valiant huge Gyants. But that one with a whip

  that is wilde and kickish, it is not good counsaile to kill him, but to breake
  him of his knauish qualities and to make him tame and gentle. Nor is it good
  aduice to destroy the Vines, but that men should be brought to drinke

  haue flowne vp and downe the Temple, and that was no good meanes for to driue
  them foorth. And if a Gouernor shall at any time exceed, the excesse of pittie
  is the lesse euill. Saint <hi>Gregorie</hi> saith, That false Iustice, is all
  indignation; and that true Iustice, is full of compassion. The glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Doctor
  Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> calleth Mercie, The better part of Iustice; and that 
  <pb n="456" facs="tcp:22083:243"/> out of the bowells of Iustice, Mercie is begot. Saint
  <hi>Gregorie,</hi> That the one without the other, is lame and imperfect. In
  the Arke of the Testament, <hi>Aarons</hi> rod and the pot of Manna were placed
  together, Seueritie and Softnesse, Iustice and Mercie; which ought to be the
  Iudges Compasse whereby he is to shape his course. One of the seuerest
  punishments which is in the holy Scripture, is that which <hi>Zacharie</hi>
  painteth forth touching impietie,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Zac.</hi> 4.</note> in
  the Ephah, which was a kind of pot or measure containing some ten pottles,
  being stopped close with abal of lead of the weight of a Talent, and a woman
  sitting in the midst thereof, whose name was <hi>Wickednesse.</hi> And lo there
  came out two women, and tooke vp this pot by the two ears from the ground, and
  carried it to the land of Shinar. Great were the Idolatries of this his People,
  and it was fit that they should be seuerely pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished; yet notwithstanding,
  these two women that carried this pot into a strange Countrie, had wings like a
  Kyte, <hi>quasi alas Milui</hi>; which make many planes, and a smooth flight:
  but the word in the originall deriue these wings from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Bird, which

  like the wings of a Storke</hi>; Which is held to be a Foule full of pittie. Of
  some rigorous Iudges the Delinquents may verie wel say, Would to God that my
  punishments and my faul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

  weighed together in a ballance, then would plainly appeare to the eye of the
  World, with what inequalitie the Iudge hath proceeded against me.</p>
               <p>The third thing for our learning, which we may draw from hence,
  is, That our Sauiour proceeded more seuerely and more rigorously against your
  Vsurers and Money-changers, breaking and throwing downe their tables, and
  scattering abroad their money.</p>
               <p>First, Because in it selfe, and it's owne nature, it was an
  vnlawfull kind of tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and therefore fit that the occasion thereof should
  bee taken away, and haue no longer footing, especially in the Temple.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Because money is a thing that clingeth close to the
  heart of man. The glorious Doctor Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> did weigh this
  well, in that case of his, who stole the wedge of gold in the spoyles of
  Iericho. <hi>Ioshuah</hi> turning himselfe towards the Sunne and the Moone, he
  said vnto them, <hi>Sol contra Gabaon ne moue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aris, &amp; Luna, contra vallem
  Ayalon.</hi> Hee made likewise a Proclamation, That none should priuily conuey
  away any gold, siluer, or other prisall. <hi>Achan</hi> ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on a wedge of
  gold, tooke it vp, and hid it. Where he obserueth, That the Sunne and Moone
  obeying the order and command of this valiant Captain, one of his owne
  souldiers refused to obey him, and only because the wedge of gold was wedged
  too close to his heart. He likewise threw their money about, and scattered it
  all abroad, in token, That when the couetous man least thinkes on it,
  <hi>Diuitias quas deuorauerat, euomet, &amp; de ventre eius extrahet illas
  Deus, Hee shal vomit vp the riches which he hath swallowed, and God shall
  plucke them out of his bellie.</hi> In an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient time they did stampe or ingraue
  vpon their coyne an Oxe, a creature that in his feeding goes still backeward:
  which is the hieroglyphicke or embleme of a couetous man,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Prou.</hi> 23.</note> who the more he eats, the more backeward
  he goes; <hi>Set not thy eyes nor thy thoughts vpon riches; for when thou least
  thinkest of it, they shall betake them to their wings like an Eagle, and shall
  flie vp to heauen.</hi> Riches that are ill gotten, flie vp to Gods tribunall
  seat, and there like so many fiscalls or busie Attornies, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse thee for an
  vniust possessor of them, and crie out as loud against thee, as the bloud of

  draw from this patterne, is, That a Prince ought more sharpely to correct those
  abuses and vices which are growne old <pb n="457" facs="tcp:22083:243"/> through custome;
  especially those of your great and powerfull Ministers, who commit them without

  sell that for their priuate profit, which they are bound to doe <hi>gratis</hi>

  administration of the Sacraments; from that Confessor that will be soundly payd
  for his Absolution; From that Iudge that will be bribed before hee will doe
  iustice; and from that Secretary that makes sutors come off roundly for their
  quicker dispatch. These be things that send many of them quicke to hell. The
  Pharisees should haue kept their Temple cleane from all couetousnesse, haue
  banished your Merchants bankes, and haue fauoured and graced those their
  Sacrifices; in stead whereof they sold those beasts that were to be offered,
  made money of them, and put the same forth to vse and profit, as others

  <hi>Gregory</hi> is of the same minde. And as <hi>Theodosius</hi> the Emperour
  said: <hi>Quid poterit esse securum, si sanctitas as incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta, corrumpatur?
  What can be secure, if incorrupted Sanctity shall be corrupted?</hi> Which is

  vpon them that shall lead away the Asse of the fatherlesse, and take the
  widowes Oxe to pledge, that shall rise early for a prey, cause the naked to
  lodge without garment, and without couering in the cold, and to plucke the

  fauour, succour, and defend the right of the poore, of the fatherlesse, and of
  the widow, that <hi>Cassiodorus</hi> in his thirty nine epistle, saith, That it
  is as needlesse and superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a businesse to aske it at his hands, as to sue
  to that which is heauy to descend downeward, or to that which is light to

  complaineth, That your great and powerfull Ministers, in stead of complying
  with their obliga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ion, and in stead
  of fauouring and defending their poore Vassalls, sell them Iustice at a deare
  rate: Verifying that lamentation of <hi>Ieremy, Aquam nostram pecunia bibimus,
  &amp; ligna nostra praetio comparauimus, Selling vnto them the water of their
  wells, and a sticke of fire from their hearthes.</hi> And would to God they
  would but sell their water and their wood, as others vse to doe at common and
  ordinary rates; for then there would some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing remaine to the buyer: but there

  him, but returnes nothing; takes all, but giues not a dodkin to the poore:
  whereas he that buyes, giues all that hee hath, and receiueth nothing. And
  therefore in that Countrey or Kingdome where the Great ones are all so
  generally bad, it is no great wonder, that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, Iustice, and whatsoeuer
  else belonging to gouernment, should be sold and <pb n="458" facs="tcp:22083:244"/> set
  forth to sale. <hi>Ieroboam</hi> made of the lowest of the people, Priests of
  the high places. Who would giue most money might consecrate himselfe, and bee
  of the Priests of the high places which; thing (as the Text sayth) turned vnto
  sinne to the house of <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> euen to root it out and destroy it
  from the face of the Earth. <hi>Simon Magus</hi> sought to buy the grace of the
  holy Ghost: What his gracelesse pretension came to I neede not tell you,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 3.</note> you knowing already how deare it cost him.
  The Emperour <hi>Iustinian</hi> sayd, That the selling of Iustice in a
  Commonwealth was the vtter vndoing of it: for why should not that Iudge or
  Officer robbe and steale, who payd so great a summe of money for his
  Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission? What would a Theefe, an Adulterer, or a Murderer care, if hee knew
  he might redeeme his offence with money? He that buyes, must of force sell; So
  sayd <hi>Alexander Seu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rus</hi>:
  And therefore he would neuer consent (as <hi>Lampri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi> reporteth it)
  that any office, at least of Iurisdiction, should bee sold in the Empire. The
  Priests therefore of the Temple selling the sayd oblations, it is not much that
  our Sauiour should whip them, and that hee should call them Theeues.</p>
               <p>The last thing that a gouernor may draw from this patterne, is
  perseuerance. There are many which are (as the Glosse hath vpon the decretals)
  <hi>Primo fer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

  deficiunt, Hot at first, and afterwards grow cold.</hi> When they are a little
  warme in their place, they flagge and fall off, punishing one, and freeing
  another, and both vniustly: They wincke at theeues and robbers on the high way,
  they cancell Deedes, falsifie Records, conceale Writings, alter Euidences,
  foist in false indictments, set delinquents at libertie, facilitate causes, and
  a thousand the like disorders, to the great detriment and disauthoritie of
  Iustice. And therefore they make the Crane, the Hieroglyph of a good Iudge,
  which neuer changes his plumes, but is all of one and the same colour, both in
  his youth, and in his age.</p>
               <p>Out of this Historie, I shall inferre three or foure
  conclusions.</p>
               <p>The first, if the selling of birds, and beasts in the Temple,
  bee so offensiue in the sight of our Lord God: What shall the selling in the
  Church bee, of bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices and Ecclesiasticall dignities? Who although they make
  no publike sale of them, or open profession of it; yet do these men sell Doues
  in the Temple, <hi>Qui de impositione manus pretium accipiunt, Hinc enim est,
  quod sacri Canones symo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

  haeresim damnant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second, If God so punish this slight respect which is showne
  to his Temple, where there was neither the Arke of the Testament,
  <hi>Aarons</hi> rod, the pot of Manna, nor the booke of the Law; How will he
  punish the prophaning of that Temple, where himselfe is consecrated in the
  Sacraments of his bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed body and bloud, and where his holy word is
  preached?</p>
               <p>The third, If he be so highly offended with the prophaning of a
  dead Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; what will he say to the prophaning of that liuing Temple of thy
  soule, which he made choice of for his delight &amp; recreation? <hi>Delitia

  saith, That there is not any thing that puts more iealousie into Gods bosome,
  than that soule which after it hath receiued Baptisme, confessed the Faith, and
  made a marriage with God by receiuing his blessed Sacraments, should afterwards
  be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a whoore to the Deuill, the World, and the Flesh.</p>
               <p>The last, If hee did driue out of this earthly Temple, the
  Merchants and Priests, in this sharpe and seuere manner and with such a deale
  of disgrace;<note place="margin">

  corne, the tares and the wheate; the ministers of Christ, and the priests of

  sentence, <hi>Ite maledicti in ignem aeternum,</hi> shall seperate the one from
  the other with an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall banishment.</p>

  thou doe these things?</hi> Seeming tacitely to grant, that it was ill done,
  and worse permitted, that any market should bee kept there. But because it did
  not appertaine vnto al to amend those things that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse, but to him that
  hath power &amp; authoritie so to do, they said to him; Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by wilt thou make
  it appeare vnto vs, that thou doost not vsurpe another mans office, and meddle
  with that which belongs not vnto thee? Whereunto our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour answered,
  <hi>Soluite Templum hoc, &amp; in tribus diebus excitabo illud.</hi> In which
  words he did prefigure forth vnto them, his Death, and Resurrection. Which were
  two such Mysteries, as did most discouer all Gods Attributes. Touching his
  death our Sauiour had said already, <hi>Si exaltaueritis filium Hominis,
  cognosce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis quia ego sum.</hi> But they were like blind men, groping against a
  wall, in this knowledge of his person. And therefore hee said vnto them; When
  yee shall haue lifted mee vp vpon the Crosse, ye shall then know, <hi>Quis ego
  sum, Who I am.</hi> Which <hi>ego sum,</hi> is a blazon, onely belonging vnto
  God: and this the Crosse did discouer. <hi>Zacheus</hi> clambered vp vpon a
  tree, that he might see our Sauior Christ, as well in regard that hee could not
  come neere vnto him for the prease of the people, the throng was so great; as
  also by reason that hee was but a little man, and of a low stature. Whereupon
  <hi>Origen</hi> giues this note, That there are not any Gyants in the world, no
  not the tallest of them all, but are Pigmies and dwarfes when they come to
  looke God in the face; and must bee faine to clamber vp to those faire goodly
  trees of the vertues, &amp; to the top bough of perfection; which will cost vs
  a great deale of trouble and labor, before we can get vp so high. And therefore
  our Sauiour Christ to saue vs so much paines, and that wee maywith greater ease
  come vnto him, he saith, <hi>Exaltate, &amp;c.</hi> Put me vp vpon the Crosse,
  and not onely you, that boast your selues of Learning, and Religion, but the
  ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der rable, those souldiers that whipt mee, and those that did execution vpon
  my bodie shall come to know me. And this shall be your <hi>Cognoscetis quia ego
  sum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These wordes, <hi>Vidimus gloriam eius, gloriam quasi vnigeniti
  à patre, We haue seene his glorie as the glorie of the onely begotten of
  the Father.</hi> Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> declares them of his death; for
  then he shewed himselfe of what house hee came, and whose son he was. Saint
  <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>If they had knowne what they had done, they would
  neuer haue crucified the Lord of Glorie.</hi> Where <hi>Chrysostome</hi>
  obserueth, That in a gallant season they called him the Lord of Glorie, hauing
  neuer before shewed himselfe such a glorious Lord, as then: His armes stretched
  out vpon the Crosse, were those two spreading wings wherewith hee flew vp to
  Heauen; and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which he did clocke and defend vs here vpon Earth from the
  rapine of the Deuill, as the Hen doth her Chickins from the Kyte. S.

  verse of <hi>Dauid, Et sub pennis eius sperabis.</hi> As also that place of
  <hi>Malachie, Orietur vobis sol Iustitiae, &amp; sanitas in pennis eius.</hi>
  And the Sunne pulled in his head as well for shame as sorrow, when hee saw
  another <pb n="460" facs="tcp:22083:245"/> Sunne to appeare, that was greater than
  himselfe, whose beames spred abroad saluation to the whole World. The Title of

  Another letter hath it, <hi>Qui declaratus est</hi>: this following afterwards
  vpon the necke of it, <hi>Soluite templum hoc, &amp;c.</hi> Where it is noted
  by Saint <hi>Cyril,</hi> That our Sauiour did not commaund them to destroy his
  bodie, but did thereby aduise them, what they would doe vnto him; Ye shall
  destroy the Temple of my bodie, and I will build it vp againe the third day,
  and this shall be a manifest, a certaine, and a sure signe vnto you. Other his
  Miracles, though they were signes sufficient enough, yet were they not so

               </p>
               <p>Our Sauior Christs answer was somewhat of the darkest to their
  clouded vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding. And albeit they drew from thence a different sense and
  contrarie meaning, yet might it serue as a signe vnto them, that hee was able
  to doe that which he did. And they that would deny, that he could destroy the
  Temple, and build it vp againe in three dayes, which was but a materiall
  Temple; would more stifly denie, that he could dye, and rise againe the third
  day, by his owne vertue and power. Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> accuseth these men to
  be false witnesses. <hi>Hic dixit,</hi> (which was the Iewes accusation)
  <hi>Possum destruere Templum Dei.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First; because they did wrest the sence and true meaning of our

               <p>Thirdly; because their proceeding against him was malicious.</p>

Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles was celebrated in the chiefe citie Ierusalem, which was one of the
three principall Passeouers of the Iewes: solemnising the same in remembrance
of that bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit which God did to that People, in leading them fortie yeares
through the Desart,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Leuit.</hi> 25.</note> not hauing any
house wherein to dwell, and yet not wanting tents or booths wherein to lodge
themselues. To this Feast came all of all sorts, from all parts of the land of
Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, building themselues Cabbins in the fields. <hi>Iosephus</hi> saith,
That they vsed Tents, from whence they went to the Temple, and performed their
Offerings for their families, according to their abilitie. Christ came on the
Tuesday to this Solemnitie: of this opinion is Saint <hi>Augustine</hi>; though
some others are of the mind, that he came thither at the verie beginning of the
Feast, though he did not make himselfe knowne till he saw a more conuenient
time. He preached to the People; and so deepe was his Doctrine, that the Iewes
wondring thereat, said one to another, <hi>Quomodo hic literas scit, cum non
ded scerit? How knoweth this man the Scriptures, seeing that he neuer
learned?</hi> And howbeit this their voyce of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration was secret, and
whispered in the eare from one to another, yet Christ made answer thereunto in
publique, shewing therein the pledges and tokens of his Diuinitie; saying
openly vnto them, <hi>My Doctrine is not myne, but his that sent me:</hi> He
that shall truly endeauour to doe his will, shall know it is his; but hee that
preacheth his owne proper doctrine, seeks after his owne honour and
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation; but he that preacheth Gods Doctrine, can neither lie nor offend
therein. The Iewes did lay a double slander vpon him:</p>
            <p>The one, <hi>Seducit turbas, He seduceth the People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other, <hi>Sabbathum non custodit, He keepes not the
Sabboth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this his answer giues a blur to them both: <hi>Moses</hi>
(saith hee) gaue you a Law, and yet none of you keepeth the Law, Why go yee
then about to kill <pb n="462" facs="tcp:22083:246"/> me? For euer since that hee cured him
that lay so long at the Fish-poole, they sought after his life. In a word, this

               <hi>Iesus went vp into the Temple, and taught, &amp;c.</hi> One of
the greatest benefits which the world receiued by our Sauiours comming, was,
That hee reading in Heauens Chaire, to so wise and discreet a companie, who by
onely reading in the booke of his Essence, were instructed in all kind of
truth; did not for all this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine to become a Schoolemaster to little
children here vpon earth, accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dating the profoundnesse of his deep
learning, to our rude and weake capacity; accomplishing that of Saint <hi>Iohn,

Angells and blessed Saints that are in Heauen, and of those faithfull ones that
are vpon earth: for the verie selfe same truths he taught them in the Temple of
his glorie, which he did these other in his Church; only differenced in this,
That they see them, and we beleeue them. Many Doctors haue sate and read in
their Chaire here vpon earth, but because they dranke not of the water of his

  in it selfe, but by accident, when it lights on an insolent brest, which
  con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerts good into euill. Your Kings and Princes haue in all ages honoured
  wise men with great titles &amp; preferments; and not only your wise &amp;
  prudent Princes, but those of meaner parts and abilities, and euen your worser
  sort of Kings. <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisius</hi> the Tyrant sent to <hi>Plato</hi> (that he
  might come to see him) one of his fairest Gallies, with store of daintie
  prouision, and well accompanied; and at the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen where he was to land, had
  prouided a Coach with foure horses to be readie to receiue him, that he might
  come in the greater pompe to his Pallace: and all this honour he was willing to
  doe him, for that he was a wise man. And if such men as he should cause such
  admiration in the world, What admiration must he raise in mens minds, in whom
  all the treasures of Gods wisedome were deposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? Whence we may consider,
  that if a few drops of that soueraigne fountaine did strike the People into
  such admiration; when in Heauen we shall see the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of that riuer, or
  rather immensitie of that great sea, What admiration must it needs mooue? Yet
  notwithstanding Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, <hi>Mirabantur omnes, sed non
  omnes conuertebantur, They were wonder-strucken, but not spirit-strucken</hi>;
  many did admire, but few were conuerted. The like successe for the most part
  haue the Sermons of your famous Preachers: <hi>Ezechiel</hi> reporteth, That it
  fell out so with himselfe; That morning (saith he) that he was to preach, the
  citisens would call to one another saying, Let vs goe and heare the Prophet,
  let vs see what new thing will now come from him: they enter in thronging, sit
  them downe, beare themselues verie grauely, and hearken diligently to my words,
  but are farre off from putting them in execution, being onely vnto them like a
  smooth verse, or a musicall Song, with a sweet and pleasing eire; nor was there
  any, of that harsh eare, who wil not one while commend the voice, another while
  the tone; this man, the dittie; that, it's ayre; but goe not a step further,
  setting vp their rest there. Musicke passes along by the doore at mid-night, it

  learning, which was the Grammaticall and Historicall sence of the sacred
  bookes, which did dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose them to other things of greater moment, and to
  mysteries of a higher and deeper nature. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> saith, That they

               </p>
               <p>But all this made the worse for them, and their proceeding
  appeares still fou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler and fouler.</p>
               <p>First of all in this: O ye Iewes (saith <hi>Chrysologus</hi>) ye
  doe not wonder, that a Virgin sho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

  himselfe thus learned, hauing not learned? you admire that which ought least to
  be wondred at, &amp; are vndmindfull of that which ought most to be meruailed
  at.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It was a foule fault in them, to see such singular
  learning, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with so vnblameable a life; and such strange miracles,
  and that they should not once thinke that this was from Heauen. Especially they
  knowing, that <hi>Adam,</hi> and <hi>Salomon,</hi> did enioy this blessing. Of
  <hi>Salomons</hi> wisedome, and whence he had it,<note place="margin">3

  <hi>Kings,</hi> and that of the <hi>Chronicles,</hi> deliuereth the same vnto
  vs: and of <hi>Adam</hi> the Schoolemen do affirme, That he could hardly haue
  giuen all things their proper names, (as Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> hath
  obserued it) if God had not infused that knowledge into him, to call them after
  that fitting and conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient manner. And this knowledge was communicated to
  Christ euen from the verie instant of his conception; by meanes whereof hee saw
  all things in their proper <hi>species,</hi> besides that blessed knowledge
  whereby he saw them in God, as in a glasse.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn</hi>
 3.34.</note> Of this infused knowledge Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> saith, <hi>God gaue
  not the spirit by measure vnto him</hi>; but it was without limitation: for hee
  that is sonne and heire to his father, is not to be stinted as those that are
  seruants. And therefore it is said, <hi>The Spirit of the Lord shall rest vpon
  him;</hi> the spirit of wisedome and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, the spirit of councell and
  might, the spirit of knowledge, &amp;c. This infused knowledge was setled in
  others by fits, not in all times &amp; all places, nor so generally in all
  things, as in our Sauiour Christ, from whom it sprouted as water from a
  Fountaine. That fountaine of the Rocke, strucke by the Rod of <hi>Moses,</hi>
  it had beene a foule sinne in the Israelites to haue searched into the veins of
  Nature, whence these waters gushed out, and not to thinke on Gods grace, from
  whence this fauour flowed: And no lesse absurde was it in the Iewes, to seeke
  in the Schooles and Vniuersities, after those veines of liuing water, of that
  diuine learning of our Sauiour Christ, which was that true rocke; and not to
  di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect their eyes towards God, who is the true giuer of knowledge.</p>
               <p>Lastly, It was a foule fault in them, to thinke that God is tied
  to humane meanes,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Reg.</hi>

                     </gap>.</note> knowing <hi>quod Deus
  scientiarum Dominus est, That God is the Lord of sciences,</hi> and that it was
  the Holy-Ghost that taught and instruucted those the Prophets, taking one from

  Sheepe.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Amos</hi> 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Non sum Phopheta,</hi>
  (saith <hi>Amos</hi> of himselfe) <hi>I am not a Prophet, nor the sonne of a
  Prophet, but a Heardsman of Tekoah.</hi> And of <hi>Dauid</hi> it is said, That
  he tooke him from the Sheepefold, following the Ewes with young. He indewed
  <hi>Daniel</hi> being a child, with wisedome: and <hi>Ioseph</hi> with
  vnderstanding to declare King <hi>Pharaohs</hi> dreame. Nor was it needfull for
  him to draw these men out of the Schooles of Athens, nor to take them from
  forth the Vniuersities of Greece, &amp;c. As soone as euer our Lord God had
  discouered to the glorious Apostle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> the beames of his light,
  he presently departed to Arabia and to Damascus to preach the Gospell: hee
  might haue gone first to Hierusalem to take acquaintance of those other
  Apostles of more antient standing, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre with them what he should
  preach: but this did not seeme vnto him a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient meanes to credit his
  Doctrine. <hi>Nec veni Hierosolimam ad Antecessores meos</hi>; to the end that
  the Gentiles might not presume, that this his Doctrine was of the earth,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.</note> and not of Heauen, as afterwards he told
  the Galathians; The Gospell which was preached by me, is not afterman, neither
  did I receiue it of man, neither was I taught it but by the reuelation of Iesus
  Christ. And the Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians, <hi>What I receiued from the Lord, I deliuered vnto
  you.</hi> But because the Iews did <pb n="467" facs="tcp:22083:248"/> surpasse all the
  world in passion and malice, they did attribute all to the Deuill, whom the
  Gentiles had made their god.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My Doctrine is not myne, &amp;c.</hi> The Commentators make
  three expositions vpon this place, <hi>My Doctrine is not myne, but I haue
  receiued it from my father.</hi> The Doctrine of the Father and of the Sonne,
  as he is God, is one and the same, as is their essence; nor is there any other
  difference more, than that he hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued it from the Father: but as he is
  man, it is in it selfe diuers, as is their nature; because it is an accident
  and an infused habit, though the truth thereof in both, is one and the same.
  Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> and Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> expound this saying of our
  Sauior, as he is man; and that this Doctrine of his, was not his, but of his
  fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that sent him abroad to preach and publish it to the World. And the
  same Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> in some other places deliuereth it of Christ, as
  he was God; but affirmeth in the end, That it may be interpreted either way.
  Saint <hi>Cyril</hi> &amp; Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> declare this of Christ,
  as he is God: but which way soeuer you take, either sence doth signifie, That
  Christ is the Sonne of God.</p>
               <p>The second Exposition is, My Doctrine is not myne, that is, It
  is not onely myne, <hi>but his that sent me.</hi> And this sence and meaning is
  founded vpon many places of Scripture; wherein this Negatiue <hi>Non,</hi> is
  the same with <hi>Non solum, Not onely.</hi> As for example, <hi>It is not yee
  that speake,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.20.</note> 
                  <hi>but the
  spirit of the father which speaketh in you, (i.)</hi> Not you alone, but the
  spirit of the Father. Againe,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.45.</note>
                  <hi>Doe not thinke that I alone will accuse you to the Father, there is another
  also that accuseth you, euen Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, in whom yee trust, because yee beleeue not
  that which he wrote of mee</hi>: that is, Hee doth not only beleeue in me.
  Thirdly, <hi>He that beleeueth in me, doth not beleeue in me,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn.</hi> 12. <hi>Marc</hi> 9.37. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi>
 15.10.</note> 
                  <hi>but in him that sent me.</hi> In the fourth place,
  <hi>Whosoeuer shall receiue me, receiueth not me, but him that sent me</hi>;
  That is, Not onely me. Lastly, <hi>I laboured more aboundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly than them all,
  yet not I, but the grace of Godwhich was with me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third, It is not myne, nor did I inuent it, nor is it the
  Doctrine of men, but of God. Many Philosophers haue out of an ouerweening
  conceit, gon a wandring, and inuented new sects and strange Doctrines, that
  they might haue the honour to be accounted authours of nouelties; answerable to
  that which God said of certaine false Prophets, <hi>They speake a vision of
  their owne heart, and not out of the mouth of the Lord: Woe vnto the foolish
  Prophets, that follow their own spirit,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Our Sauiour Christ teacheth vs here two things:</p>
               <p>The one, That God is the Fountaine of Wisedome; and that as the
  Earth cannot yeeld it's fruit without water from Heauen, so the heart of man
  cannot affoord any fruit without the Doctrine of God. <hi>Concrescat vt plunia

                  <hi>Duo vbera tua sicut duo hinnuli

  The wisest men haue euermore beene the meekest and the humblest; in Saint
  <hi>Augustine,</hi> humilitie and wisedome suted so well together, that no man
  was able to iudge which was the greater. <hi>Salomon</hi> said of himselfe,

  mysteries of Diuinitie, had need of the jesses of Humilitie, lest through
  vaine-glorie soaring too high, he scortch his wings, and like <hi>Phaeton</hi>
  come tumbling downe. The eyes of the Spouse, her Beloued com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares to the eyes

  when she feeds,<note place="margin">The Doue of all Fowles the most

  euer since that she returned with a greene Oliue branch in her mouth, to
  <hi>Noahs</hi> Arke, she hath been taken for a thankefull Bird; as on the
  con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, the Crow is held to be an vnthankefull Carrion. Of this
  thankefulnesse or grateful acknowledgement, there are many symboles or emblems
  in humane Authors; as in the Sunne-Dyall, with all the houres specified therein
  by distinct figures, with a hand poynting out this Letter vnto vs, <hi>In vmbra
  desino;</hi> that is <pb n="469" facs="tcp:22083:249"/> to say, To the Sunne doe I owe my
  motion and beeing. As likewise in the Shell full of pearle, lying open to the
  Sunne and the dew of Heauen, with this word or motto, <hi>Rore Diuino,</hi>
  that is, By the helpe and fauour of the Sunne of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse; for without
  this diuine dew, there is no vertue in our selues. As also that of the Oliue

  <hi>Seneca</hi> saith, That he that acknowledgeth a debt by words, which he
  cannot satisfie by deeds, hath paid what he owes: And <hi>Cicero</hi> renders
  the reason thereof, It is not all one (saith hee) to pay the debt of a benefit
  receiued, as that of money; for this is not paid till the money be restored:
  but hee that doth acknowledge a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, and confesseth a kindnesse, being not
  otherwise able to make satisfaction, hath alreadie made repayment. Of this kind
  are the fauours conferred by Kings, which we can no otherwise requite, than by
  our seruing &amp; magnifying of them. And therefore much more those that come
  from God, from whose free hand we receiue whatsoeuer good we enioy; nor are we
  able to repay it in the same money, but by our seruing him, and magnifying his

  first seene; after the sight, followes the taste: <hi>The woman saw that the
  fruit was pleasant to the eye</hi>; whereupon she tooke of the Fruit, and did
  eat. Here the sight did precede the taste, but in Heauen we first taste, and
  afterwards see; there the taste precedes the sight: and in my opinion, Saint

  vnderstanding: but a depraued Will is like vnto an infirm eye, which through
  it's indisposition doth not see the light. The places of Scripture which
  confirme this Doctrine, are without number. <hi>Ecclesiasticus</hi> saith, More
  truths will one holy soule sometimes declare, than many vnholy Doctours and

  wherewith he went vnto the King, about the libertie of the Hebrew people, being
  so much inslaued, inthralled, and so sorely taxed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all right and reason:
  On the other side, so many scourges, so many plagues, so much feare, and so
  much death; and yet notwithstanding hee durst not cause him to be apprehended,
  nor to be put to death, nor had not the power to touch vpon that thought. And
  questionlesse the reason thereof was, that he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged a superior power
  proceeding from Gods Word, which <hi>Moses</hi> did euer and anon repeat vnto

  to tremble within him, and maugre his greatnesse to acknowledge God. The

  among the people, or for that by his Sermons (as Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> hath
  noted it) he had withdrawne the People from those sacrifices wherein
  <hi>Amaziah</hi> was interessed; he laboured with him, both by cruell
  threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and gentle persuasions, that he would get him gone into the Land
  of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah, <hi>Get thee into the land of Iudah, and there eat thy bread, and
  prophecie there.</hi> But when he was most threatned, then did he preach most
  against <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> not stic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to say, <hi>Ieroboam shall die by the
  sword;</hi> his wife shall be a Harlot in the Citie, and thy sonnes and thy
  daughters shall fall by the sword, and thy hand shall bee deuided by line, and
  thou shalt die in a polluted land, &amp;c. For the Word of God, the more it is

  Certain Pharisees aduising our Sauior Christ, to get him gone out of
  <hi>Herods</hi> Dominions, and to flie the Kingdom; returned them this answer,
  Tell King <hi>Herod,</hi> for all this his heat and spleene against me, that I
  will cure the sicke, and cast out deuils, to day and to morrow, <hi>Et tertia
  die consumer.</hi> Signifying thereby, that hee would liue for all him, as long
  as he listed, &amp; dye when he listed. S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> when the emperor
  <hi>Theodosius</hi> was so mightily incensed against him for his boldnes in
  prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, said vnto him, May it please your Imperiall Maiestie, it becomes
  not an Emperour, nor is it in his power to impose silence vpon the Preacher of
  Gods word: Nor does it befit a Preacher to hold his peace where there is iust
  reason to reprehend. The one is an affront offered vnto God, whose Legat hee is
  that preacheth; the other, cowardise in Gods Minister, who carrying with him
  the warrant of Gods word, ought not to be afraid of any thing. Many doe excuse
  themselues of vsing reprehensions, for that they suppose they will be <hi>Sin
  proue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho, without profit,</hi> and worke little good vpon their Auditorie. And
  yet our Sauiour Christ did seuerly reprooue the Pharisees, though they were
  neuer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whit the better for it, that others might reape fruit thereby, and be
  admonished by other mens harmes.</p>

  according to the appearance, but judge righteous iudgement.</hi> Our Sauiour
  Christ said formerly vnto the Pharisees, <hi>Why doe yee seeke to kill
  mee?</hi> For euer since the time of the forementioned Miracle, they sought to
  slay him, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people charging him with a <hi>Daemonium habes,
  &amp;c.</hi> But Christ making no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie to the vulgar, passing that ouer,
  went about to prooue the small reason that they had to plot his death, because
  he had done this good deed vpon the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both day, <hi>Vnum opus feci, &amp;
  omnes admiramini.</hi> Saint <hi>Chrisostome</hi> expoundeth this
  <hi>admiramini,</hi> to be a condemning of him to bee a transgressour of the
  Law. <hi>On the Sabboth</hi> (saith our Sauior) <hi>yee Circumcise</hi>; and
  Circumcision is no breach of the Sabboth, much lesse the healing of him that is
  lame. Circumcision hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the soule, but woundeth the bodie: But I in lesse
  time cure both body and soule. Circumcision is of the antient Fathers, the
  Sabboth of <hi>Moses</hi>: you suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Circumcision, and so did
  <hi>Moses.</hi> If of this worke there followeth no transgression, neither
  ought there of mine. The Iewes hereunto might answer, Circumcision is of the
  antient Fathers, and confirmed by <hi>Moses</hi>; but thy worke is of a base,
  vulgar, and ordinarie person. Whereunto our Sauiour answereth, <hi>Nolite
  iudicare secundum, &amp;c.</hi> Iudgement ought to be made onely of mens
  acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, without acception of persons. Ye magnifie <hi>Moses</hi> (as Saint
  <hi>Austen</hi> saith) and <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi>; and yee
  despise mee, my workes beeing more strange <pb n="472" facs="tcp:22083:251"/> and
  wonderfull: Without doubt ye are accepters of persons. The Pharisees might
  replie, Circumcision is a diuine precept, but thy worke is not so. This
  ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is of no force; for the obseruation of the Sabboth, was likewise a
  diuine precept; but because that of the Circumcision was the more antient of
  the two, they did prefer this before that: And therefore Christs worke, being
  grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the Circumcision, wee are to suppose that it was diuine, and by
  conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to be preferred before it. To conclude, it seeming to the
  Pharisees an vnworthie thing, that the authoritie of a common man should be
  parallel'd with that of the antient Patriarches, they condemned him for a
  transgressour. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon our Sauiour sayes vnto them, <hi>Nolite iudicare
  secundum faciem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First of all, he here condemneth in Iudges the accepting of
  persons, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to so many places of Scripture, which condemne this
  inequalitie. <hi>Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> saith, <hi>Fortissimus non habebit in
  illis patientiam.</hi> And though God be so merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a God, &amp; of such
  great sufferance, yet here by an Hyperbole, he will not haue patience with
  those Iudges, which for hatred, loue, or profit, shall bee mooued to pronounce
  an vniust sentence; nor with those princes and potentates of the World, which
  in matters of Iustice, shall carrie an vneuen hand. And hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth those
  Kings that were to raigne ouer his people, that they should beare the booke of
  the Law about them, and should read therein all the dayes of their life,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.</note> 
                  <hi>That they may learne to feare the
  Lord thir God.</hi> For, If the feare of God doth not bridle them, they are
  head-strong and cannot be ruled. Iudges, haue for their bridle, God, and the
  King; Kings, onely God. And against those that shal loose their respect towards
  him, he saith, Heare therefore ô ye Kings, and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Wisd.</hi> 6.</note> learne ye that be Iudges of the ends of

  of people: For the rule is giuen you of the Lord, and power by the most high,
  which will trie your workes, &amp; search out your imaginations. Because that
  ye beeing officers of his Kingdome, haue not iudged aright, nor kept the Law,
  nor walked after the will of God; horribly and suddenly will he appeare vnto
  you; for an hard iudgement shall they haue that beare rule. And the mightie
  shall be mightily tormented. To many great sinners, God giues a long life,
  hauing an eye to the ill that waytes for them; but bad Gouernours and Iudges,
  hee cuts short, and permits them not to liue out their dayes.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Deut.</hi> 1.</note> And therefore, <hi>Nolite iudicare

               </p>
               <p>And because, sticking many times vpon Gods recommending vnto
  them the cause of the poore, and the fauour that should bee showen them as well
  in their person, as matter of Iustice; and considering on the other side, their
  miserie and want, some pittifull Iudge, contrary to Iustice, many incline to
  fauour his cause; our Sauiour addeth, <hi>Rectum iudicium iudicate,</hi> Let
  not your eyes, nor your hearts, be carried away with the miserie of the poore,
  nor the prosperitie of the rich. And as God hath commanded, <hi>Regard not the
  Person of the mightie,</hi> So likewise he saith, <hi>Regard not the Person of
  the Poore, but judge rightly.</hi> And this sence is that which is pretended in
  the Text.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he condemneth all kind of rash iudgements, &amp; all
  doubtfull things where there are not manifest proofes, or some
  <hi>indicia,</hi> or signes of euil, there to leane to the better part. And so
  <hi>Thomas</hi> teacheth them. To iudge solely vpon sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition, is meer
  rashnesse, which commonly ariseth from these three grounds.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Rash iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to bee

  stultos aestimat,</hi> so sayth <hi>Ecclesiasticus</hi>: The theife thinkes all
  to be like himselfe, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The other, proceeds from passion, which commonly iudgeth ill
  vpon light oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions, <pb n="473" facs="tcp:22083:251"/> of him whom he either hateth or
  enuieth.</p>
               <p>The third, from long experience of things past: And therefore
  <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith, That old men are verie iealous and suspicious. And
  this is the least blameable; for suspition is apt to entertaine a sinister
  opinion, but experience will goe vpon certainties. There is great difference
  betwixt doubt, suspition, and judgement. There are <hi>indicia,</hi> or signes,
  that are sufficient for doubting, which are not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for suspecting; and
  for suspecting, which are not sufficient for iudging: and all of them recouer
  more or lesse force from the qualitie of the persons whom they concerne; for
  there are many <hi>indicia</hi> or tokens which are sufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
  vicious and lewd persons, which are not sufficient against persons of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nester

               <p>
                  <hi>Then they sought to take him, but no man laid hands on
  him.</hi> The end of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference was to apprehend him, but not a man of
  them that durst aduenture to do it; for when as they sought to stone him, their
  stones were frozen to their fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers ends; so now they had the crampe in their

  therein the greatnesse of his power. At his wisedome they remained astonished,
  and at his power they were forced to yeeld. And these are the two attributes of
  a powerfull and absolute Prince: Power without Wisedome, is an vnruly beast,
  that runs on to his owne destruction; and Wisedome without Power, is too weake
  for atchieuement; nor is there that rash action, which a powerfull foole will
  not put himselfe into. <hi>Dionysius</hi> the Tyrant was woont to say, That
  then he did enioy the sweetnesse of his Empire, when he did execute his desires
  in an instant.<note place="margin">Power and Wisedome, are not to be seuered in a
 prince.</note> Power is a headstrong horse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Wisedome serues as a
  bridle to curbe and restraine it's furie. The Wiseman alluded hereunto, when he
  said, That God had giuen him wisedome like the sand that lies on the sea shore,
  which repells the waues, though neuer so great, and bounds them in.
  <hi>Plutarch</hi> saith, That to a bare absolute power, not bounded in with
  this sand, malice and mischiefe was neuer wanting. The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
  <hi>Iustinian</hi> in the entrance to his <hi>Institutions,</hi> saith, That in
  the Maiestie royall, the beautie of armes is not onely necessarie, but the
  force also of learning. He attributs Force to Learning, because that bridles
  the strongest thing that is, which is Armes. Our Sauiour Christ then, beeing
  the true patterne of so great and glorious a Prince, as none greater; Power and
  Wisedome could not chuse but concurre &amp; meet equally in him; To whom, with
  the Father, and the Holy-Ghost, be ascribed all Power, Honour, and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,

made his eyes so cleere and so perfect, that those did not know him, who held
conuersation with him. And thus did the case now stand betwixt the Gentile and
the Iew; the one was stark blind, and the other did see perfectly; the Iew
enioyed none, the Gentile much light, <hi>The people that walked in darkenesse

               <hi>As Iesus passing by, &amp;c.</hi> This businesse seemeth to be
a thing done as it were by chance; but there is not any thing that God doth
commit more to memory, than the relieuing of our miseries. The Bush wherein God
appeared vnto <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> which did burne, and yet was not burned, did
represent the stubble which his people did gather to bake their bricke, and
those firie tribulations which did burne, but not consume them. And if any man
shall aske me, How this Bush could be on fire, and not be burnt? I answer, That
God had such present vse of the fire, that it seemed to ouerslip the bush. The
Prophet <hi>Abacucke</hi> went to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie food to the sheepheards that were in
the field, but the angel taking him vp by the haire of the head, carried him
away into Chaldea, &amp; landed him in the Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons Den in Babylon; for
<hi>Daniels</hi> hunger required that hast, that the reapers in the field were
forgotten; which was an extraordinarie care and especiall prouidence of God.
But why doth the Euangelist say, <hi>Praeteriens,</hi> passing by as it were by
chance? And <hi>Ezechiel</hi> vnder the similitude of an Infant, deliuering
vnto vs, That as soone as she was borne, she was cast out into the open field,
to the loathing of her person in that day she was borne; <hi>When I passed by
thee,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ezech.</hi> 16.</note> 
               <hi>I saw thee polluted
in thyne owne bloud.</hi> Hereunto I answer, That God doth dissemble his care,
because thou being not able to pay the principall, nor any desire to satisfie
this his great care and loue towards thee, he would draw thee (if it were
possible) to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of that debt which is due vnto him: for it is
a common cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome amongst men, not to make requitall of that care and loue
which hath bin shewn vnto them. A Goldsmith makes a cup for you, you pay him
for the weight of his plate according to it's ounces, and for the fashion
according to it's worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship; but you doe not pay him for his loue vnto you,
for Loue is so noble a thing, that it cannot be repayd but with Loue. And if
mans loue cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payd, much lesse Gods: but if it dasheth thee out of
countenance,<note place="margin">Loue cannot be repaied but with loue.</note> to
see what a deale of loue God expresses towards thee, &amp; that he makes thee
the mark wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at he aimes al his care; yet at least shew thy selfe so thankful
as to satisfie him for thy workemanship, as thou wouldest the Goldsmith for the
fashioning of a peece of plate, whither he had by chance, or purposely made it
for thee. God demanded of <hi>Iob, Where wast thou when I laid the foundations
of the earth?</hi> As if he should haue said, Because thou camest not then into
the world, thou maist hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thinke that I made this so faire a fabrick either
by chance, or for my own plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, [<hi>Ludens in orbe terrarum</hi>] and not
purposely for thee; but I would haue thee to know<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that I made this so
princely a pallace for thee, furnishing it with all things fitting for thee,
and that if I had not foreknowne that thou shouldst enioy the same, I would not
haue made it. But if thou shalt not repay mee for my care and my loue, that I
made thee for the end of this so great a worke; yet thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully accept of the

hee that receiuest benefit thereby.</p>
            <p>Our Sauior as he passed thus along, was verie angrie, and much
offended; but he had no sooner met with this blind man, but his anger was
alayed,<note place="margin">Christ euen in his sufferings mindfull of our
  solace.</note> and grew more calme and milde. In <hi>Caiphas</hi> Court, a sea
of iniuries &amp; affronts came tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling in vpon him; and euen then in this
great inundation that brake thus vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently <pb n="476" facs="tcp:22083:253"/> in vpon him;
he no sooner turned his eye aside vpon <hi>Peter,</hi> and beheld those two
Fountaines of teares that flowed from his eyes, but that he presently seemed
wonderfull well contented. The booke of <hi>Canticles</hi> introduceth the
Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued speaking to his Spouse,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.</note>
               <hi>I haue mixed my myrrh with my spice: ô friends, drink of my wine,
yea, drinke aboundantly, ô Beloued</hi>; for the end of his bitter
draughts prooued to be a most pleasant wine for our palats. In any other brest
than that of our Sauiour, the stones of the Pharisees would haue made a great
noyse: but malice is a verie shallow water, but goodnesse a verie deepe Sea. A
stone in a shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Well wil make a great noyse, &amp; will dash the water
about thyne eares; but in a deepe Well you shall scarce heare the sound
thereof. But this comparison is somewhat of the shortest; for it is one thing
to suffer, and another in suffering, to take compassion. But the goodnesse of
our Sauiour Christ did <hi>patiendo compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti: non solum erat patiens, sed
compatiens.</hi> Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> saith, That he did not only suffer ill,
but did requite ill with good, <hi>Retribuebant mala pro bonis, &amp; odium pro
dilectione mea, They returned euil for good, and hatred for my loue</hi>; But
to return good for euill, is the highest round of Vertues ladder.
<hi>Salomon</hi> saith, That wisdome is fairer to behold, and more beautifull
than the Sunne, <hi>Speciocior est Sole</hi>: For the Sunne is eclipsed by the
darkenesse of night; but the wisedome of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, neither malice, nor
iniurie, nor any other affront can cloud or darken it, but serueth oftentimes
as an occasion to beame forth greater fauours vpon vs. Saint <hi>Bernard</hi>
compares our Sauiour Christ to the Bee, which alwayes labours and takes pains
for other folkes profit: a swarme of Bees lights in thy garden, leaues thee
honie-combes and waxe, all this not costing thee so much as one crum of bread.
But this comparison likewise comes a little too short; for the Bee being
offended, stings thee; But our Sauiour Christ inriching our house with world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
goods and heauenly blessings, doth not hurt vs, though we prouoke him neuer so
much to anger; he brings vs in Honie, but leaues no sting behind him. Better
and more proper is that comparison of the Vine, whereunto our Sauiour com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares
himselfe, <hi>Ego sum vitis v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Dauid</hi> marched in great hast with his souldiers after certaine
thee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uish Amalekites, that had burnt and spoyled Zicklag; in which hot pursuit
hee found an Aegyptian in the field, who was readie to giue vp the Ghost, for
he had eaten no bread, nor dranke any water in three dayes and three nights.
Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Dauid</hi> made a stand, relieued him, and restored him againe
to life; for the which he well repayd this his kindnesse; for he brought him to
the place where these theeues were eating, drinking, and dancing for ioy of the
spoyle they had taken; from whom <hi>Dauid</hi> recouered all that the
Amalekites had taken away. Some spitefull man will not sticke to say, We are
now as pittifull: not conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in the meane while with himselfe, that he
would neuer forgoe a Play, to go heare a Sermon, neuer omit other his worldly
businesse, to goe visit an hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, or to giue an almes to the Poore.
<hi>Iob</hi> complaineth, That when he sate scra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping his sores vpon the
dunghill, his brethren past along by him, not so much as once vouchsafing to
looke vpon him,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iob.</hi> 6.</note> but hasted speedily
by him, like the down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall of a water from a rocke, which swiftly glideth downe
to the bottome of some low valley: <hi>Praeterierunt me sicut torrens in
conuallibus.</hi> The seuentie Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters render it, <hi>Non respexerunt,
They did no whit respect him,</hi> nor so much as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to looke after him.
Imagine (saith <hi>Thomas</hi>) that foure goe hand in hand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether 
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:22083:253"/> all one way, and that one of them fals into a pit,
whilest the rest passe on and let him alone: In like maner might <hi>Iob</hi>
say, that his brethren dealt so with him; being that neither nature, neerenesse
of bloud, old acquaintance, nor long bred friendship, could moue their hearts
to pittie, or their eyes to teares.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iesus saw a man that was blind from his birth. And his
Disciples asked him saying, Master, Who did sinne, This man, or his parents?
that he was borne blind, &amp;c.</hi> This is an old fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tered wound, that we tooke in the fall of our first
parents, to be too curious in other mens faults, and too forgetfull of our
owne. Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> saith, That there is scarce one to be found,
euen amongst those that are most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, which are not infected with this
vice. If a man walke abroad in a morning into the fieldes, his neighbors
inheritance is more in his eye than his owne; and when he comes home at night,
he presently askes what newes there is stirring? And is well pleased with any
tidings that are told him, especially of other mens misfortunes.
<hi>Plutarch</hi> makes this simile; That as in Cities there vse to be some
vnlucky gates, wherat nothing enters, or goes out that is good, saue dunghils
that lye in the streete, and persons that are condemned to death; so likewise
into the eares of the Curious, nothing enters that is good. It was the saying
of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Philosopher, that of all kind of winds, those were most
troublesome, which did whirle our clokes from off our shoulders: In like
manner, of all sortes of men, the Curious are most to be abhorred, which vnwrap
the clokes of our shame, blow open our disgrace, and rip vp the graues of the
dead: and as <hi>Xenocrates</hi> said of them, They enter not into other mens
houses with their feet, but their eyes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He saw, &amp;c.</hi> This might very well assure them, that he
lookt vpon him with the eye of Loue.</p>
            <p>First, because it is Gods nature and condition, when he doth one
fauour, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage himselfe for many other courtesies. And therefore,<note place="margin">Whom God once fauours, he still fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes.</note> hauing done him
the fauour to looke vpon him, he was now obliged to giue him his sight.
<hi>Cicero</hi> saith, That it is the property of a noble brest, to him that
owes much, to desire to make that man more his debtor. <hi>Est animi ingenui,
cui multum debeas, eidem &amp; plurimum velle debere.</hi> The bestowing of one
fauour vpon mee (saith <hi>Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>
               </hi>) makes me the bolder to beg another; And since thou hast
stuck vnto me in my life, ô Lord, doe the like in my death. God did
reueale vnto <hi>Dauid</hi> by the Prophet <hi>Nathan,</hi> perpetuitie of his
Kingdome; and after this so great a fauour, he further addeth, <hi>Therefore is
thy seruants heart readie to pray vnto thee. Ezechias</hi> had receiued
extraordinarie kindnesses from Gods hand, and these were motiues to make him
intercede for farther fauours. In a word, one courtesie conferred vpon vs,
incourageth vs to craue a second. But that the conferring of one fauor
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hould lay an obligation, or make
one desirous to doe another on the necke of that, this onely holds in God, as a
peculiar noblenesse belonging vnto him. And for to secure vs of all those
fauours, which wee can expect from his greatnesse, the Church saith of our
Sauiour Christ, that was offered vp for vs, <hi>Nobis pignus datur, A pledge is
giuen vs.</hi> Now a pledge is alwayes pawned for lesse than it is worth.
Hauing therefore thus impawned the infinit treasure of his person, what will he
not bestow vpon vs? If he haue giuen thee eyes, will hee not giue thee hands?
And if he haue giuen thee hands, will he not giue thee a heart? So that Gods
doing of one fauour, is the assuring of many. In the Wildernesse when all
<hi>Agars</hi> bread and water was spent, and seeing her sonne ready to dye for
thirst, she lifted vp her eyes to Heauen calling vpon God, <hi>Et exa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

that he would giue her water, &amp; suddenly a Well was discouered vnto her,
&amp;c. Here were two fauours done her alreadie; First, His hearing her.
Secondly, His granting her her request. But God did not stop here, <hi>In

               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.</note>
               <hi>I will make him a great Nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Because mans wants and necessities being looked on by
the eye of Gods loue and pittie, his goodnes neuer leaues him till his remedie
be wrought. And therfore it is said by the Psalmist,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 142.</note> 
               <hi>I poured out my complaint before
him, I shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before him my trouble</hi>: so that when I present my griefes
&amp; tribulations before him, if he once but looke vpon them, I am sure he wil
help me. This kind of cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Martha</hi> &amp; <hi>Mary</hi> vsed with
him, <hi>Behold, he is sick whom thou louest. Ezechias</hi> ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

same trick, <hi>Lord open thyne eyes and see, &amp; bow downe thyne eare, and
heare the words of Zenacharib, &amp;c.</hi> And as our sinnes doe crie vnto God
for vengeance, so our miseries doe crie vnto him for mercie. God plagued the
Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Philistines with that foule and grieuous disease of the
Emmerods; but vpon their presenting the Images of them before the Arke, he
freed them of that euill. <hi>Thou knowest my shame and my reproch,
&amp;c.</hi> And if my prayers doe not sometimes pierce Heauen, it is because
my persecutions and afflictions haue as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended thither, and notified my
miserie: and when man is ashamed to speake, yet that will speake for him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Who did sinne, this man, or his parents?</hi> Saint
<hi>Cyril</hi> saith, That the Disciples hauing whispered amongst themselues
touching this mans misfortune,<note place="margin">Sin the occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all
  euill.</note> they askt our Sauiour, <hi>Quis peccauit? &amp;c.</hi> Wherein
they went wisely to worke, in attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting punishment in the generall, to
sinne; for by attributing them many times to naturall causes, as to the Sunne,
aire, water, and other distemperatures, the fruit of Gods chastisements is
lost. <hi>Petrus Crysologus</hi> treating of those teares which our Sauiour
shed at <hi>Lazarus</hi> death, saith, That he did not bewaile his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall,
for he knew how happie he was in being out of the world; but the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. He
thought vpon <hi>Adams</hi> apple, that had beene the cause of so much hurt,
and this was it that made him to weepe. And this his weeping was, as if hee
should haue said, What a deale of sorrow hath this one act of disobedience in
him, brought vpon all mankind, and consequently vpon me, who must beare the
burthen of his and their offence? O Sinne, How deere will it cost both Man and
me? In a word, There is not any one thing so often repeated in Scripture, as,
That Sin is the cause of our miseries, <hi>De humo non egreditur dolor.</hi>
And in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, verie iust and lawfull was this their demand, touching,
<hi>Quis peccauit? Who sinned?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, Because they did desire to see it verified, whether this
fauour which they muttered amongst themselues, were well employed or no: for it
is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon custome in Court, when the King shall cast a fauourable eye vpon
any one, and gratiously looke vpon him; not onely to examine his life, and to
question what hee is, but to rip vp that of his fathers and predecessours, to
flea those that are aliue, and to disinterre those that are dead. And howbeit
for proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of offices, and for the conferring of Court dignities, and
other publique preferments in the Commonwealth, it is fitting for Kings and
Princes to take a strict view and examination concerning the honestie and
abilitie of those they aduance; yet in the relieuing of wants &amp;
necessities, al such diligences are vnne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie and vniust: For a Prince, or
any other rich and powerfull person, (sayth Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi>) ought
to be like a good port or hauen, which should receiue into her protection all
sort of passengers whatsoeuer, but to those that haue suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered 
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:22083:254"/> shipwracke, and are without present reliefe and helpe,
vpon casting away, should more especially stretch out her armes, and take them
in before they sinke.</p>
            <p>Secondly, For that they attributed the blindnesse of
<hi>Celidonius</hi> to the sinnes of his parents: for albeit God doth punish
the sinnes of the fathers in the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, euen to the fourth generation; yet
this punishment is neuer in the soule, but in the bodie, for the soules are not
by race and descent; neither hath the soule of the sonne any kindred or
alliance with that of the father, as the bodie hath; onely the sinne of
<hi>Adam</hi> hath somewhat thereof, as being the head and root from whom we
all come.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, They would haue reduced this punishment to his owne
proper sins, for that he was borne blind; for though God doth vse anticipation
in doing fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours for some seruices that are to be done, yet doth he neuer
punish sinnes not yet committed: but it is rather the blazon of his justice, to
punish with a slow hand; as it is of his mercie, to pardon speedily.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, to attribute punishments to faults committed, is a good
iudgement, and an approoued censure, for our owne sinnes, but not for other
mens. When our Sauiour Christ said to his Apostles, <hi>One of you shall betray
me</hi>; euery one lookt first into himselfe, demanding of him, <hi>Rabbi,</hi>
Master, <hi>Am I the man or no?</hi> And though he shewed them a faire
euidence, <hi>Hee that dips his hand with mee in the dish, &amp;c.</hi> yet
none of them fixt their eyes vpon <hi>Iudas,</hi> nor tooke notice of the signe
then giuen them. The Pharisee is not so much condemned for his own proper
sinnes, as for the scorne and pride wherewith he despiseth others, <hi>I thanke
thee, ô God, that I am not like other men. Emisenus</hi> saith, That
there can be no greater mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, than to make those sinnes myne, which
another man doth commit for his pleasure or his profit, both which I make to be
myne, by iudging rashly of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Man
  the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of the World; the Eye, of Man.</note> 
               <hi>but that the workes of
God should bee made manifest in him.</hi> Some man may aske me the question,
Why God should make choice of these his eyes, to make them to be an instrument
of manifesting his workes, rather than the hands of the benummed, the feet of
the lame, the tongue of the dumbe, the raising of the dead, or the torment of
those that are possessed with Deuills? I answer hereunto, That all these
miracles might serue verie well for Gods glorie. And of <hi>Lazarus</hi> his
death our Sauiour said, That it was <hi>pro gloria Dei, for Gods
glorie.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Eye is the Hearts market place.</note> But
in the Eyes there is a more especial con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniencie (as S. <hi>Chrysostome</hi>
hath noted it) than in other the parts of the bodie: For as man is the summe
and Epilogue of all the naturalities of the World, for which reason they call
him, <hi>Microcosmos, A little World</hi>; so the eyes are the summe and
Epilogue of man. And as <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith, That the Soule is all things,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> a certaine kind of manner,
because all things are come vnder the compasse of i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>'s apprehension and vnderstanding; so
the eyes in a manner are all things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they comprehend all things in
them, the heauens, the planets, the starres, the elements, birds, fishes,
beasts, plants, and stones; nor doe they onely see in the eyes, corporall
creatures, and visible substances, but likewise the inuisible passions of our
soule; as loue, hate, pride, humilitie, &amp; the like, so saith
<hi>Plinie.</hi> And therefore Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> stiles the eyes, the
heralds of the heart. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> tells vs, That there are eyes full
of adulteries: In a word,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.</note> The eyes
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>as <hi>Salomon</hi> saith) are the
open market place of our bosome. And in another place, <hi>All the wayes of man
are in his eyes</hi>: And <hi>Ecclesiasticus, Ex visu cognoscitur vir.</hi> Our
Sauiour Christ did restore this man to his sight, and made his eyes become 
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:22083:255"/> cleere, to the end that in them might bee cleerely
manifested the most famous workes of God. <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> Saint
<hi>Chrysostome,</hi> and Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> say, That he made him without
eyes, that by bestowing them afterwards vpon him, he might mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest to the
world, That God his Redeemer had created him anew. Saint <hi>Austine</hi> harpt
vpon the same string, treating of <hi>Malchus</hi> his eare.</p>
            <p>Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, That God making these eyes of so
base a matter as c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ay or durt,
intermingled with spettle, representeth the mysterie of the Incarnation,
wherein God did raise and lift vp our nature to the admirable vnion of his
hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly condition, from whence the Word became flesh, which gaue light to
this blind man, and those that sate in the shadow of death, hauing the eyes of
their soules darkened with sinne.</p>
            <p>Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> affirmeth, That Christ taught vs by this
myracle, that for to recouer our soules sight, we must put durt vpon our eyes,
that is, we must thinke vpon our owne basenesse and frailtie: For the
<hi>principium</hi> or beginning of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian perfection, is, for a man to
know himselfe. Nor were his workes onely manifested in these his eyes, but all
his other perfections and attributes; as his omnipotencie, in restoring his
eye-sight, or rather making him new eyes, mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded out of durt; his justice, in
letting the Pharisees liue in their blindnesse; and his goodnesse and bountie,
in giuing light to this blind man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Neither hee nor his parents, &amp;c.</hi> Saint
<hi>Chrysostome</hi> askes the question, Why God would manifest his workes in
this blind man so much to his cost, being that he might haue taken for this
purpose, means of good, and not of hurt? Saint <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose</hi> saith, That
our Sauiour Christ was willing to take our sinnes as a pledge or gage of his
glorie, that he might make it thereby the surer: For those that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
Tributes, or settle their Rents, are alwayes careful to haue good securitie;
and of all other assurances,<note place="margin">Sin the only Security that God
  could haue of man, for his Glory.</note> the best is, that the State thus
ingaged or impawned, be properly belonging to the debtor. And if God should
ground his glorie on our goodnesse, we cannot giue him any good securitie for
it, because this is others goods, and not our owne: but our sinnes are our
owne, and whatsoeuer is ill in vs, properly belongeth to vs, and are so
perpetuated to our persons, that they can neuer faile vs. Christ did redeeme vs
from the captiuitie of our crimes, but in this his redeeming and ransomming vs
from sinne, this holy Saint sayth, That he had a kind of interest of his
owne:<note place="margin">Reasons why God suffereth many corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall defects, and
  weaknes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses in man.</note> for although God did not remaine thereby more
powerfull, more mercifull, more iust, &amp;c. <hi>Habuit tamen quod ad cultum
suae Maiestatis adiungeret, He had something by the bargaine, that gaue an
addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the worship of his diuine Maiestie.</hi> And as it is in another
place, by giuing vs libertie, <hi>Sibi etiam aliquid acquisiuit, He got
somewhat also to himselfe.</hi> What did he get by it? He got in a manner all
his glorie by it; he got to be reuerenced, ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, praised, acknowledged, and
adored, to bee as well a Sauiour as a God: so that in some sort God may be said
to be indebted to the ill that is in vs. <hi>Tertulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> saith, That God
then loueth this our flesh, when it is fullest of miseries, for by giuing
remedie thereunto<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his attributes are knowne and acknowledged in the
World: and I dare be bold to say it, That if it were not for the infirmities of
our flesh, and the in-bred ill that is in vs, those good things would not bee
knowne and acknowledged, which come from God. In the 113 Psalme, <hi>Dauid</hi>
makes an enumeration of those meruailes and prodigious wonders which God
multiplied in the behalfe of his People, at their departure out of Aegypt: And
after that he had related many of them, he endeth with this, <hi>Goe on as thou
ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> begun, ô Lord, with these
Nations.</hi> For although the profit will be ours, the honour will be thine:
and whereas these Nations doe point out their gods with their 
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:22083:255"/> fingers, it is fit we should also know that wee haue a
God amongst vs, and not a god of wood, as they haue.</p>
            <p>The second reason is Saint <hi>Bernards:</hi> Amongst all his
other attributes,<note place="margin">2. Reason.</note> none in our opinion, none
(considering his naturall condition) is to be compared with that of his being
<hi>misericors,</hi> a mercifull God: He is called <hi>Pater
misericordiae,</hi> The Father of mercie; which presupposeth our miserie: and
to multiplie his bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings and his goodnesse vpon vs, we hauing no sinne nor
euill in vs, hee could hardly doe it. If hee should haue dealt thus with
<hi>Adam</hi> before his fall, and with the Angells in their blessed estate, it
might haue been an effect of his boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, but not of his mercie, which is
aboue all his workes.</p>
            <p>But some man perhaps will say, O Lord, to throw euills vpon vs,
that thou maist afterwards remooue them from vs, is no such great fauour. Yes
marry is it, and that an extraordinarie fauour; for we doe not know health, but
by sicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; the seising of that soundly vpon vs, shewes what a blessing a
sound bodie is: <hi>Speciosa misericordia Dei, quasi nubes pluuiae in tempore
siccitatus,</hi> As raine is wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come in a drought, so is Gods mercie to the
Afflicted: and so to this blind man was his sight.</p>
            <p>The third is Saint <hi>Chrysostomes</hi>: God sometimes takes from
vs what is good,<note place="margin">3. Reason. God neuer takes any thing
  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rom vs, but
  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn a better.</note> that
he may giue vs that which is better; whatsoeuer God doth repaire by my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle,
is better than that which is possessed by nature, as it succeeded in the wine
at the Wedding. Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> treating of the conuersion of Saint
<hi>Paul,</hi> saith, That it was a great happinesse that he was strucken
blind, for by this his blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse he was taken vp into the third Heauen, &amp;
there saw such things as man may not vtter; and when he came to receiue againe
the eys of this his bodie, he pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed withall the eye-sight of his soule:
and so did it likewise fare with this blind man.</p>
            <p>The fourth reason is, God inflicting the euill of punishment vpon
man,<note place="margin">4. Reason. Nothing which God inflicts vpon vs can sauour
  of injustice.</note> God therein doth not doe man iniustice; for (as Saint
<hi>Chrysostome</hi> saith) there is in this life no more than one good, and
one ill; the good consists in seruing God; the ill, in offending him. Let no
man therefore complaine of his misfortunes, for there cannot be any disaster so
great, that can hurt thee in the least haire of thy head, <hi>Capillus de
capite vestro non peribit.</hi> And if a man doe not runne hazard in the losse
so much as of one haire, there will be much more care had, that the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and
more materiall parts shall not perish. Many in Ierusalem hauing eyes, remained
blind; and this blind man hauing no eyes, came thereby to enioy his sight both
in bodie and in soule. <hi>Seneca</hi> saith, That the want of eyes caused in
many the want of sinning, &amp; was a great occasion of their innocencie of
life, and inculpabi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>itie.</p>
            <p>The fifth reason is, That it is no iniustice in God,<note place="margin">5. Reason. No man but d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>serueth more than God doth lay vpon him.</note> to inflict
punishment vpon vs; for albeit there be no proper precedent sinne, neither in
our selues nor our Parents, yet the original sinne that we are liable vnto, may
draw, and that iustly, most grieuous punishments vpon vs; as Saint
<hi>Augustine</hi> hath learnedly noted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning little infants which suffer
sickenesse and death. So that Gods freeing of man from punishment, is mercie;
his not freeing him, no iniustice. Thou hast many debtors, thou forgiuest one,
and suest another; it is a kindnesse to the one, but no iniurie to the other.
One owes thee a great summe, thou art contented to
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ake a little; for this, thy debtor
owes thee a great deale of thankes. God tooke away this mans eyes from him, he
might likewise haue bereaued him of his feet and his hands, he is bound to
thanke him that he spared him the vse of those. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, this cannot be said
to be so much a taking away of that which is due, as <pb n="482" facs="tcp:22083:256"/> not
a giuing of that vnto him, which he might, if he would. The good things which
we enioy, are from God, and hee may distribute them as it best pleaseth him.
Againe, the arme is to defend the head, though it runne the hasard of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
lost; a Citisen for the safeguard of his Commonwealth, a Subiect to saue his
Soueraignes life, a Christian for the glorie of Christ, a Creature for the
ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his Creator, and Martyrs for the maintenance of their Religion, haue
not refused to lay downe their liues: it is not much then, that this man should
be contented with the losse of his eyes, that the Workes of God might be made
manifest.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">6 Reason.</note>The sixt reason is, That

               <note place="margin">7 Reason. It is God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loue must fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion vs

Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi>; It being ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested in this blind man, That God is
our sole Creator, and that no hands but his onely, can mold and fashion vs
anew. Man considering the Worlds great beautie, was desirous to search out the
author thereof; and the Deuill boasting forth and assuming to himselfe the
glorie of this admirable piece of worke, blazoned it forth vnto them, I am the
Lord of all this Vniuerse, I made the wor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

God, the greater part of the world adoring him in his Idolls. God finding
himselfe thus wronged, did permit in man these maimes and defects in the eyes,
hands, and feet, and other the like monstrous mis-shapednesse. Now if the
Deuill had the power to repaire these imperfections, he might then enioy this
glorie: But if all the Idols (as <hi>Baruc</hi> saith) being put together,
cannot giue sight to the Blind, how can they then be God?<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Baruc</hi> 6.</note> The wonderfullest worke that God euer
made, was Man; and in Man, the greatest artifice and workemanship, are his
eyes. Our Sauior therfore had so ordred it, that this man should be born blind,
that his eys being fashioned &amp; giuen him by his hand, the world might
acknowledge him to be their God and their Redeemer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>When hee had thus spoken, hee spat on the ground, and made

ceremonies. And much adoe is made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the cost and cure of this poore mans
eyes. O Lord, thou hast restored o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <pb n="483" facs="tcp:22083:256"/> men by a bare
word onely, so didst thou reuiue the widowes sonne lying on the beere; and so
didst thou raise vp <hi>Lazarus</hi> from the graue, thy voice alone was
sufficient. In the creation of man, thou didst onely vse the dust of the earth,
and therefore man is said to be made <hi>de limo terrae.</hi> And albeit some
doe affirme, that man was made <hi>de luto,</hi> of the durt, or mould of the
earth, yet the Hebrew word, expresses it to no other fulnesse, than that man
was made of dust. And our vulgar translation saith, <hi>Puluis est.</hi> But
how is it that these eyes must cost a little more labour than all the other
eyes besides, and all those other liues tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hree reasons rendred.</p>
            <p>The first of Saint <hi>Cyprian,</hi> who saith,<note place="margin">1. Reason.</note> That this blind man had not onely <hi>lae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> potentiam,</hi> the facultie
disinabled where the sight did reside, as many blind men, who hauing the organs
of their eyes whole, and the apples cleare, see no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all; But this man
had otherwise the organs of his eyes wanting vnto him, the hollow places
thereunto belonging, beeing like shop windowes close shut vp, and skinned ouer
as the rest of the face, and that our Sauiour did fill vp those emptie holes
with durt which he had moulded and knedded together into a masse or lumps of
clay, with the helpe of his spittle. And this was the reason, why they
afterwards said vnto him, <hi>How were thine eyes opened?</hi> But to giue a
man an arme, a hand, or a foote, it may sooner be imagined, than made by any
but by our Sauior Christ, who was God. Whence I infer, That because God had
breathed the spirit of Life into Man, there were certain Hereticks that stickt
not to say, that the Soule of <hi>Adam</hi> was of the substance of God; they
might better haue sayd that it was made of the substance of the eyes of this
blind man.</p>
            <p>The second,<note place="margin">2. Reason.</note> For that the
Pharisees did attribute these our Sauiours Miracles to the Deuill, he did proue
in this blind man, that onely the vertue of God was powerfull to worke this
wonder.</p>
            <p>First, Because no naturall vertue can giue sight to the blind. And
therefore by consequence the Deuill could not doe it, whose miracles are
wrought by apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the naturall vertue of the Creatures, as Saint
<hi>Austen</hi> teacheth.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He made good this his miracle, by curing him with this
clay, or dust, which was verie good meanes rather to put out, than doe any good
to the eyes. Whereas if the Deuill should haue cured him, hee must haue done
it, by applying some helpfull vertue that had beene accommodated and fitted for
the sight. Onely it is God that can worke these strange effects by contrarie

            <p>The third, is of Saint <hi>Ambrose.</hi> Our Sauior Christ was
willing to aduantage this mans sight both in bodie and in soule:<note place="margin">3. Reason.</note> And therefore it is a farre greater mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle to
create the eys, than to raise vp the dead to life. This blind man was to be the
battalion that was to withstand many great incounters, and contradictions; As
the strict examination of his blindnesse, what were his parents, what his
birth, what his breeding: And therefore it was requisit that he should be armed
with a great deale of light, with a great deale of courage, constancie, and
reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, not onely to answere the arguments, which the passion and
hard-hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tednes of the Iudges were to presse him withall, but to suffer
banishment, &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusion from their Synagogue, which sentence of
excommunication they were to pronounce against him.</p>

               <hi>I must worke the workes of him that sent mee, while it is day,

and it behooues mee to make hast.<note place="margin">Wee must make hay while the

with raine, he hastens to the sowing. Saint <hi>Austen</hi> cals good Workes,
the Seedes of bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sednesse, <pb n="484" facs="tcp:22083:257"/> which we must sow in our
life time, that we may reap the fruit of them hereafter, <hi>They went foorth

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I must worke, &amp;c.</hi> Good God, What doth this import
thee? It importeth Man to looke vnto it. In that correspondence which God holds
with Man, hee will that they bee partners and share gaines alike: and therefore
hee calls our good, his; and his glorie, ours. Our Sauior Christ suffers death;
&amp; his death, is our redemption. And therefore it is said, <hi>It was meet
that Christ should dye.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> preacheth this Doctrine, and
giuing the World to vnderstand thereof, hee discouereth Christs glorie,
vttering thereupon, <hi>I shall shew vnto you, how fit it was that he should
suffer for my sake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The night commeth, when no man can worke, &amp;c.</hi> Euerie
one hath his day, which is the period of his sowing season, and of his labour;
which done, he may haue the happinesse to take his quiet rest in the night. He
that shall goe about to make of night, day, shall find hee is much deceiued;
for, <hi>The night commeth when no man can worke.</hi> That which importeth is,
<hi>That while wee haue time, we doe good</hi>: for to this end Time is giuen
vnto vs. And if the figge tree, because it did not bring foorth fruit in it's
due time, was cursed by our Sauiour: what shall become of the sinner that at no
time brings foorth any fruit? Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> much condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth those
men, which seekes after occasions for to passe away the time, as to game, chat,
read idle poems, and tell tales and lyes, to weare away the time, least
otherwise it should seeme tedious vnto them. The time which God giues thee for
Repentance, to craue pardon for thy sinnes, to sue for grace, and for to
purchase glorie, thou letst it runne on without any fruit: farre better it were
for thee to redeeme this thy ill spent time; for hee that redeemeth his time by
Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, redeemeth all sortes of time whatsoeuer, Euen the time that is
past. For albeit, <hi>ad praeteritum non est potentia, the time that is past
can not be recalled,</hi> yet it is not to be vnderstood touching the time of
Repentance; according to that saying of Saint <hi>Paul, Redimentes

&amp;c.</hi> The present with good workes, the past with repentance, the future
with perseuerance, and a full purpose of amendment of life. In a word,
Repentance doth not loose one houre, no not one minute of time. The good
Theefe, in the very last houre, did repaire all the lost yeares of his
life.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Humilitie a great helpe to the curing of a
  sicke soule.</note>
               <hi>Goe to the poole of Siloam, &amp;c.</hi> First this
blindman did herein shew a great deale of humilitie, in that he was not
scrupulous what they should say of him that should see him passe through the
citie with his eyes full of durt. For points of honour are oftentimes scandalls
to the Soule, and make the infirmitie of the disease incurable. <hi>Naaman</hi>
the Syrian stood vpon point of honour, that <hi>Elisha</hi> should come vnto
him,<note place="margin">4. <hi>Reg.</hi> 5.</note> and lay his hands vpon his
leaprosie; As also that hee should bid him to wash himself in Iordan; wherat he
was very wroth, &amp; refused to come at him, saying in anger to
<hi>Elisha's</hi> messenger; If we shall compare water with water, Are not
Abana, and Pharphar, riuers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israell?
May I not wash in them and be cleane? Which said, hee tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and went away in
a rage. Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> saith, That the Pharisees did not beleeue in
Christ. What, said they with themselues, shall we bee so respectlesse of our
honour, as to subiect our selues with the vulgar to so base a man as hee?
<hi>Saul</hi> made lesse reckoning of loosing God, than the worlds honour,
<hi>Honora me coram populo</hi>: So as <hi>Samuel</hi> would but honour him
before the people, come what would of the rest,<note place="margin">The like are
  Obedience &amp; Faith</note> he did not greatly care.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He shewed a great deale of Obedience and Faith. The
waters of <pb n="485" facs="tcp:22083:257"/> Siloam were not able of themselues to giue
sight to this blind man; but I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue (said the blind man) that they will
worke this good effect vpon me: Hee might haue willed me to doe that which
might haue carryed with it a greater reason of hope; But the sheepe (saith
<hi>Chrysologus</hi>) must goe to his feeding, and his folding, whether it
shall please the sheepheard to lead him forth. The schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler must learne that
which his master teacheth him. The sicke patient must bee ruled by his
Physitian. He hath libertie (saith Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi>) to speake vnto
his Physitian, that he will doe his best to cure him, but not to prescribe him
the Physicke that he shall minister vnto him. The like course wee are to take
with the heauenly Physitian of our soules:<note place="margin">Sicke patients may
  pray, but not prescribe.</note> For it were a strange kind of vnmannerli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in vs, besides our diffidence to relye vpon an earthly Physitian that can on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cure our bodies, and not put our trust in God, who can cure both body and
soule. The Chirurgian comes to thee with Cauteries, and layes corrosiues to thy
sores, thou patiently indurest it, and not once openest thy mouth, and shalt
thou not as well beare, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, he exprest a great deale of thankfulnesse. Saint
<hi>Bernard</hi> applies this vertue to those words of <hi>Ecclesiastes, The
riuers come out of the Sea, and returne much bettered backe againe to the
Sea</hi>; as giuing thankes for the water which they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: for the
acknowledging of one kindnes, is the drawing on of another. And if those riuers
should haue rested themselues contented with the waters they had receiued, and
not haue paid the Sea his due Tribute, that bounty would not haue beene
bestowed vpon them. In like manner those good things which wee enioy, flow from
God, that immense Sea of goodnesse, and they are againe to be returned vnto God
through our thankfulnesse; and when that ebbeth in vs, the other neuer floweth
from him, <hi>Cessat gratiarum decursus, vbi non est recursus.</hi> The raine
from heauen ariseth from the vapours of the earth: And when there are no
vapours, there is no raine. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> desired of God, That he
would bee pleased to reueale the secrets of Scripture vnto him, promising in
requitall of so great a fauour, a perpetuall acknowledgement thereof.
<hi>Confiteor tibi quicquid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venero in libris tuis. Ecclesiasticus</hi>
commending the noble Acts of <hi>Dauid,</hi> as his wrestling with beares,
tearing the iawes of Lyons, killing of Gyants, and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comming the Philistims,
he concludeth, That all these things succeeded lucki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with him, because he
was thankefull to the Lord,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Eccl.</hi> 47.</note> and
directed his heart vnto him, and established the worship of God.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, before our Sauiour Christ had giuen this blind man the
eyes of his soule, he proceeded fairely, maintained Christs honour against the
Pharises that opposed it. And this, as I may so tearme it, his honourable
carriage prepared the way for him to attaine to the heigth of vertue. The
Romans had two Temples adioyning each to other, (as S. <hi>Augustin</hi>
reports it) the one of Honour, the other of Vertue: But no man could come vnto
that of Vertue, vnlesse he first passed through that of honour.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Valerius Maximus</hi> relates vnto vs, That <hi>M.
Marcellus</hi> a Roman Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, being desirous to build one sole Temple to
Honour and Vertue, the Priests would not permit him to doe it; Alleaging, That
it was not fit, for if by chance any miracle should happen in that Temple, they
were not able to auow, to which of the two it ought to be attributed.
<hi>Ioseph</hi> fled from the inticements of his wanton and lasciuious
Mistresse, for that it was an offence both to God, and his owne honour,
<hi>Quomodo possum hoc malum facere?</hi> My Lord hath trusted me with all his
whole house, if I should be false vnto him, I should hazard my happines in
heauen, and my honour on earth. In a word, the Actes of Honour are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times 
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:22083:258"/> so heroicall, that they seeme to be miracles of
Vertue.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>He went his wayes therefore and washed, and came

that prophecie of <hi>Abacus</hi>) from before the face of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Christ:
And of a young man that was carried out of the Citie vpon a beere to be buried,
whom his mother went to accompanie to the graue with teares in her eyes, and
many more besides. Vpon which occasion, our Sauior shewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe Lord of

            <p>
               <hi>Iesus went into a Citie called Nain, &amp;c.</hi> The
Euangelist had formerly mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that myracle of <hi>Peters</hi> mother in

passe,</hi> that the day after, hee went vnto a Citie called Nain, where in the
verie gate of the Citie he met with a sad companie, that were going to a
solemne Funerall, full of teares and sorrow. And albeit this may seeme to be a
casuall thing, and that hapned (as wee say) by hap-hazard; yet was it the maine
and chiefe care of our Sauiour Christ, to prie into euerie corner of that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
land, and not to skip ouer any one place therein, which hee did not measure
forth with his feet; so that he did not omit that miserie whereunto hee did not

               </gap> a remedie: Suting with that
saying, <hi>Et sanabat omnes, And he cured them all</hi>; shewing therein, what
a good account he made of his office of a Sauiour, since his first comming into
the world. There are two things which make a man very eminent in his
office.</p>
            <p>The one, His inclination and good intentions, which are the feet
of our soule.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="488" facs="tcp:22083:259"/>The other, His paines taking, and continuall
occupation in all kind of Arts, as well Mechanicall, as Liberall. And in verie
truth, in all both good and euill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises, so powerfull is mans naturall
inclination, That although a man may smo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it for a time, yet like fire
vnder ashes, it will at last breake forth into a flame, and discouer his true
disposition. A theefe will neuer leaue his inclination to theeuing,<note place="margin">Naturall incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations hardly admit a cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge</note> though he hath
often escapt the gallowes: Nor a Cheater to his cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging; nor a Merchant to his
trading; nor the Marriner to his nauigation; nor the Huntsman to his hunting;
nor the souldiour his disposition to warre, though he haue discontinued it
neuer so long. <hi>Dauid</hi> was growne old, and well stroken in yeares, when
his sonne <hi>Absalon</hi> rose vp in rebellion against him, and yet they could
not perswade him from going into the field, though the whole Army were against
it, and cryed out, <hi>Thou shalt not goe forth.</hi> And they gaue him a very
good reason for it in the words following: For, if we flye (said they) they
will not care for vs, neither if halfe of vs dye, will they care for vs; but
thou art worth tenne thousand, &amp;c. And this is a kind of voluntary
violence, which with a sweet kind of pleasingnesse hales the heart of man
along. And the like reason may be rendered of continuall occupation and
imployment, it is death to such a one to be idle; and he is no longer well,
then while he is in action. Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> hath well obserued, That
<hi>Iob</hi> vpon euery the least occasion of happines that befell him, it was
his fashion of phrase, and a vsuall custome with him to say, <hi>The Lords name
be praysed.</hi> So that afterwards, hauing formerly vsed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe thereunto
in the tempest of his disasters, and those bitter stormes of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerser
fortunes, it was neuer out of his mouth. These two things were subsis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>g in our Sauiour Christ in a
superlatiue degree.</p>
            <p>First, so great was his inclination and desire to saue, that for
others welfare, he was carelesse of his owne,</p>
            <p>Secondly, he was so solicitous of this his busines, and so wholly
taken there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, that he cared not for any thing else, And this is expressed
in the word <hi>Ibat, He went.</hi> Which argues a continuation in his going
on.</p>
            <p>Some man may make a doubt, and say (though vnaduisedly) Had it not
beene better for our Sauiour to haue beene in the mount of Oliues, or in the
garden of Gethseman, or on the hills of Ephrem, than to goe thus from house to
house, from Castle to Castle, and from Citie to Citie? Whereunto I first of all
answer; That it is enough that he did not so, because it was not the better
course. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, because he was the same that was personally promised to that
blessed Land, and that there was not a corner in all that Countrie to be left
out, which should not finde the fauour of his diuine influences. Thirdly, the
exercises of the life actiue,<note place="margin">Contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and action must
  neuer be seuered.</note> and contemplatiue, are those two wings, whereby the
soule sores vp to heauen. And because one wing will not serue the turne to
reach to so high a pitch, we must not onely serue God in our prayers and
meditations, but also in the releeuing and succouring of our neighbour: And
therefore our Sauiour Christ spent the nights in prayer; <hi>Per noctabat in
oratione</hi>: and the dayes, in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling bodies, and curing of soules.
<hi>Petrus Damianus,</hi> vpon the life of <hi>Elias</hi> and <hi>Elisha,</hi>
saith, That there is no remote solitary mountaine, which doth not ground it's
retyrednesse vpon some one example or other of the Saints. One, is a friend to
the world, and a louer thereof; and this man alleages, That <hi>Elias</hi>
spent many dayes in the widow of <hi>Sareptaes</hi> house; And that
<hi>Elisha</hi> soiourned with the Shu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namite, that was a great and principall
woman in her country: And that both of them did treat with great Princes and
Potentates. Another is a friend and a louer of delicacies, and alleageth, That
<hi>Elisha</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> did accept of them. But these 
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:22083:259"/> men doe not consider, That if these Prophets did forgoe
their solitude, it was more for the good of others that liued abroad in the
world, than themselues, as also for the raising vp of the dead: And if they did
receiue good intertainment, it was no more than was necessary for the
sustenance of their bodies. <hi>Elisha</hi> would none of <hi>Naamans</hi>
gold; Nor <hi>Elias</hi> be feasted by King <hi>Ahab,</hi> and
<hi>Iezabell</hi> his wife. It is a thing worthy the consideration, That our
Sauiour Christ ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing not so much as one pennie of money wherewith to pay
<hi>Caesar</hi> his Tribute, willed Saint <hi>Peter</hi> to open the fish that
he had taken with his angling rod. Our Sauiour permitted <hi>Peter</hi> that he
should catch such a multitude of fishes, that the nets did breake with the
fulnesse of them: But now hee would not haue him catch, but one onely fish. For
a Church-man ought to fish for all the fishes that he can possibly take; and
the more he takes, he doth God the more seruice: but for those money-fishes,
that haue pence in their bellies, he must take but one onely, and that too for
to pay Tribute, not for himselfe, nor to satisfie his owne couetous desires, or
his idle pleasures.</p>

  <hi>Eccè,</hi> it being so common a thing in the world (as nothing more)
  to see the dead dayly carryed forth to their buriall, it seemeth a superfluous
  labour, and a needlesse kind of diligence; especially, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that this our
  life is no other thing but a continued Procession of the quicke and the dead.
  When <hi>Adam</hi> saw <hi>Abel</hi> was slaine, and lay dead on the ground,
  being the first man of whom death had taken possession, he was so
  heart-strucken, and so amased thereat, so fearefull, so sorrowfull, and so sad,
  that for many yeares after hee was not freed from this feare and horrour, nor
  were the teares dryed vp from his eyes. For albeit that God had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified vnto
  him, That he was to dye the death, yet did he not as yet know by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
  what kind of thing death was. But after that death had flesht himselfe in mans
  blood, cutting downe more liues than a Sythe doth grasse in your faire and
  goodly medowes; this his feare and horrour began by degrees to slack and fall
  off. An Eclypse of the sunne doth strangely intertaine the sences attention,
  not onely for to see so faire a Planet lapt vp in mourning weedes, but also for
  that it so seldome hapneth: But the Eclypses of mens liues, though they be the
  fairest sunnes vpon earth, they so hourely, nay so momentarily succeede with
  vs, that we can scarse (which way soeuer we looke) turne our eyes aside from
  them.<note place="margin">No obiects more vsuall than those of our

  sicknes we lye lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing a long time, besides those occasioned by famine,
  pestilence, and warre: yet those other sudden and vnexpected deaths which daily
  succeed, may euery houre find our eyes occupied. For wee see them euer and anon

  him. And it is an euill thought in man, and much to be pittied, that a man
  should afflict himselfe for that which neither hee himselfe nor all his
  posteritie shall liue to enioy. O foolish man, doost thou thinke thou shalt
  returne to liue againe in those goodly houses that thou hast built, and to
  reinioy those pleasant gardens, and orchards that thou hast planted? No, But

  not build a temple to Death, nor to Pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, nor Hunger; judging them to bee
  inexorable gods; But more inexorable is Death, for man neuer returnes againe
  from Death to Life. And therefore the Antients painted Death with the Tallons

  themselues with the losse of the World, and that the world shall be consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
  and be no more. But ô thou foolish man, if thou must dye &amp; return
  thither no more, what is the world to thee? when thou art at an end, the World
  is ended with thee. And if thou beest not to inioy it any more, what is it to
  thee, if God doe vtterly destroy it?</p>

  faire horse armed at all points, who ouerthrew <hi>Heliodorus</hi> vpon the
  pauement, and presently two young men fell vpon him, and whipt him with
  scourges till they left him as it were for dead. For this cause did God comfort
  this Widow at the gates of the Citie, where the Iudges had their Tribunalls,
  notifying vnto them, that they should take Widowes into their tutelage &amp;
  pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection; and the rather, for that a supremer Iudge, the Iudge both of
  Heauen and Earth, was willing to take so much the more care of them, by how the
  more was their solitude and priuate course of life. Saint <hi>Hierome</hi>

  gold, buried him in her owne bowells by drinking downe his ashes: in
  contemplation whereof, there is a verie medicinable herbe called after her
  name, Artemisia; which all Widowes in stead of other hearbes or flowers, ought
  to haue lying by them vpon their <hi>Estrado's,</hi> their beds, and their
  chamber windowes. Of those other fabulous widowes, <hi>Alcione</hi> may serue
  as an example, who tooke on so extreamely for the death of her husband, that
  the gods were faine to comfort her; and when they had giuen her comfort, she
  was metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phised at last into a Bird bearing the same name: of which Saint
  <hi>Ambrose</hi> sayth, That it liues about riuers of waters, the feathers
  thereof being greene, and the beake red, in token that those Widowes that so
  quickely receiue comfort, their life is commonly greene and youthfull, and
  their words red and full of amorous passions, lanching themselues forth like
  Ships, into a sea of vices and voluptuous pleasures, turning their vails to
  sailes, which faile with euerie wind.</p>

  said, That he pittied the son, but the mother; for they that die are not so
  much to be pittied as they that liue: for if he that dies goe to Hell, we wrong
  Gods justice if we take any commiseration of them; and if they goe to Heauen,
  their happinesse doth not require it, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing more reason to enuie than pittie
  them. <hi>Lots</hi> wife was turned into a piller of salt, because she sorrowed
  for the burning of Sodome: and in Heauen, as there can be no miserie, so is it
  impossible that there should be any commiseration; so that pittie is onely to
  bee reduced to those that liue. The Scripture calleth death, Rest and Sleepe.

  resolution, <hi>Their sinnes were not yet growne vp to their heigth.</hi> So
  that his leading them all this while through the Wildernesse, was a lesse

               <p>We know that there are diuers and sundrie sorts of teares.</p>
               <p>Some are occasioned by the excessiue sorrow and griefe of our

               <p>Others are shed by vs meerely out of compassion for other folks

               <p>Others gutter downe from vs out of a vehement and earnest desire
  wee haue to our celestiall Countrie, and to the enioying of that our heauenly
  habitation. Of this qualitie were those of <hi>Dauid, Woe is mee, that the time

               </p>
               <p>There is another sort of teares which flow from naturall pittie
  and conceiued griefe, for the death of our parents, children, kinsfolkes, and
  friends; as also for losse of wealth, honour, health, and the like; and when
  the Scripture mentions them, it doth not reprehend them. The Shunamite bewailed
  her dead sonne; <hi>Marie Magdalen,</hi> the losse of her brother
  <hi>Lazarus</hi>; and humane Histories recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend <pb n="496" facs="tcp:22083:264"/> these
  teares of pitty vnto vs: <hi>Alexander</hi> wept when he met with a troup of

               </p>
               <p>Now these teares may offend two manner of wayes:</p>
               <p>First, In their excesse; for God will not haue vs to bewaile
  that thing much, which in it selfe is little. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> hath
  obserued, That after <hi>Iacob</hi> began to mourne for the losse of
  <hi>Ioseph,</hi> and the bereauing him of <hi>Beniamin,</hi> which mourning of
  his continued almost the space of twentie yeares; God withdrew those
  <hi>Regalos</hi> and fauours from him which hee was wont to conferre vpon him:
  before, the Angells ascended and descended the ladder; before, the Angell gaue
  him strength to wrestle all night long, &amp;c. before, he inioyed prosperitie,
  wiues, children, and victorie against <hi>Esau</hi>: but afterwards, the more
  teares, the more sorrow fell vpon him; for God neuer grants to the teares of
  the earth, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of Heauen. And although he permit a mannerly and
  moderate kind of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall pittie,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eccl.</hi> 22.
 <hi>Eccl.</hi> 38.</note> according to that of <hi>Ecclesiasticus, Super
  mortuum modicum pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ra</hi>: And in
  another place, <hi>Quasi dira passus, incipe plorare,</hi> My sonne, let teares
  fall downe ouer the Dead, and begin to lament, as if thou hadst suffered great
  harme thy selfe. Such few drops he fauoureth and cherisheth, but if they be
  excessiue, or ouermuch, he condemneth them as vnlawfull, and as a wrong done
  vnto God. For the losing of God, or the losse of his loue, thou mayst well
  weepe World without end, because it is an incomparable losse; but for the
  outward losses of this World; <hi>Incipe plorare, Begin thou to weepe,</hi> but
  quickly make an end.</p>
               <p>The second offence is, That a man hauing cause enough to bewaile
  his owne sinnes, the losse of his Soule, and of God; doth notwithstanding
  lament these earthly &amp; transitorie losses, neglecting the former. This
  disorder Christ sought to rectifie and amend in those tender-hearted women of
  Ierusalem, who wept so bitterly to see how ill hee was vsed by the Iews, and
  how heauie the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of his Crosse lay vpon him. <hi>Daughters of Ierusalem,
  weepe not for mee, but weepe for your selues, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He went and touched the coffin.</hi> The first place is
  taken vp here by his mercie, which is the wel-head of al those blessings which
  we receiue from his bountiful hand.<note place="margin">Gods mercie the Spring
 from whence all his bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings flow.</note> His Prouidence doth conserue vs;

  antients stiled <hi>Iupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Optimus maximus</hi>; Because (as <hi>Cicero</hi>
  notes it) the attribute of Beneficence is more gratefull and acceptable in God,
  than his Greatnesse and Power.</p>
               <p>In the second place, came in his words of comfort, <hi>Noli
  f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>In the third, his hands, <hi>Tetigit loculum.</hi> Heere hee
  exerciseth his hands, his tongue, and his heart. If we cannot imitate the hands
  of our Sauiour Christ in doing good; yet at least imitate his heart, and his
  tongue. For Pittie and words cost nothing, and are wanting to few.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They made a stand, that bare him.</hi> Here he shewed
  himselfe Lord both of the liuing, and the dead. And therefore Saint

  complained, saying, This is a People robbed &amp; spoyled, they are all of them

  <hi>Chrysostomes</hi> note, That the word Doores is put here in the plurall

  deliuereth a sinner, <hi>That all may speake of thy praise, and talke of thy

               <p>
                  <hi>And there came a feare vpon all.</hi> It may seeme to some,
  That the word Loue would better haue become this place, and beene fitter for
  this present purpose and occasion: All (a man would thinke) should rather haue
  expressed their loues vnto him, sung forth his prayses, and offered their
  seruice vnto him. In those former punishments of a World drowned and
  ouerwhelmed with Water, of a Sodome burned and consumed with Fire, it was verie
  fit and meet that it should strike feare and amasement into all: But in such a
  case as this, What should cause them to feare? Hereunto I answer, That nothing
  doth strike such a feare and terrour into man, as the great and wonderfull
  mercies of God. A Roman Souldier told <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> It much troubles
  me, nor can I be heart-merrie, as oft as I thinke on the many fauours that I
  haue receiued from thy liberall hand; but doe rather hold them as so many
  wrongs and iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries done vnto me; for they are so beyond all requitall, that I
  must of force proue vngratefull, which makes me to feare, that thou wilt
  proceed against me for a heinous offendor in this kind. In like manner, so many
  are the mercies of God towards man, and so infinite, that they may be held as
  Vigiles of his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture seuerer Iustice. <hi>Iacob</hi> did in a manner vtter
  the same sentence against him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, <hi>Minor sum cunctis miserationibus
  tuis,</hi> The least of thy mercies is greater than all my merits; nor can the
  best seruices that I can doe thee, make satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for the least of those
  fauours which I haue receiued from thy bounteous liberalitie. Grant, ô
  Lord, that what is wanting in our owne worthinesse, may bee made vp in the
  mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and merits of our Sauiour Iesus Christ; To whom, with the Father,

drinking the same vp at one draught;<note place="margin">Death is a large

all Beleeuers. Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> vpon this occasion saith of him,

before thou tastedst of this cup, thou saidst, <hi>Transeat, Let it passe</hi>;

as a good Drinker doth of a good cup of drinke when he is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie thirstie. In a
word, Not onely because this was a myracle wrought vpon a dead person that had
lien foure dayes buried in his graue, but because the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legious councell of
the Scribes and Pharisees had layd their heads together, and 
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:22083:266"/> plotted the death of our Sauiour Christ; as also in
regard of those other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, That the deceased partie was nobly borne,

               </gap>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
came to visit him in his sickenesse, and did weepe and bewaile his death, did
our Sauiour performe this myracle. Amongst all those myracles which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
Christ wrought, Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> giues to this the first and prime
place: and indeed it seemes to be an epitome and short summe of all those other
myracles that he wrought in the whole course of his life; for in the
resurrection of one that is dead, there is giuen sight to the Blind, eares to
the Deafe, a tongue to the Dumbe, feet to the Lame, motion to the Paraliticke,
&amp;c. And therefore Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> with this myracle doth (as it were)
shut vp and giue a close to the proouing of his Diuinitie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A certaine man was sicke named Lazarus, &amp;c. Therefore his
Sisters sent vnto him.</hi> Here we may consider the good aduisement and
discretion of this noble paire of Sisters. When <hi>Marie Magdalen</hi> treated
of the reparation of her own soule, she went her selfe in person, passing
through a world of inconueniences; but for the restoration of her brother to
his bodily health, she thought it would be sufficient and serue the turne well
enough, to send her Seruant with a letter to our Sauiour. The Worldling for the
health of his bodie will round the world; but will not stirre a foot for his
soules health: For to esteeme of things as they are, and to giue them their
true weight, and to put euerie thing in it's proper place, is not onely the
marke of a prudent, but of a predestinated person. Aegypt taxed <hi>Moses</hi>
of ingratitude (as <hi>Phylon</hi> hath noted) in his life, for that hee did
for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Pallace, refused to be called the sonne of
<hi>Pharaohs</hi> daughter, and chose rather to suffer aduersitie with the
People of God, those poore Israelites, than to weare the Crowne of Aegypt, and
to enioy the pleasures of the Court; esteeming (as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith)
the rebuke of Christ greater riches than the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of Aegypt. But first of
all, he was not vngratefull; for concerning those good blessings which he
enioyed, he was more bound to God for them, than to the King. Secondly, he
shewed he was no foole in doing as he did; for better is one crumme of bread in
the Lords house, than all the prosperitie of the world without it; <hi>Than to
enioy</hi> (to vse Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> words) <hi>the pleasures of sinne for a
sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. I had rather be a Doore-keeper</hi> (saith <hi>Dauid</hi>) <hi>in the
house of the Lord, than to dwell in Tabernacles of sinners. Nazianzen</hi>
reporteth, That the Emperour <hi>Valens</hi> offering Saint <hi>Basil</hi> his

That he should highly esteem of the Emperours fauour and friendship, but hee
was to esteeme more of Gods. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, That <hi>Adam</hi>
did eat of the Apple, <hi>Ne contristaret delitias, &amp;c.</hi> least he
should grieue his Loue; not led along with carnall concupiscence, but with a
friendly affection. Suting with that of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> That <hi>Adam</hi>
was not deceiued, but the woman was deceiued: but it had beene better for
<hi>Adam</hi> to haue displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

would haue thee to know, that a talking tongue and a dumbe heart doe not sute

Prayer did put this word <hi>Qui est in Coelis, Which art in Heauen,</hi> being
that he is present euerie where, and in all places? And his answer is, That his
desire was, that our prayers should proceed with that feruencie and forcible
ejaculations, as if God could not heare vs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse by our prayers we pierced
Heauen. <hi>As for our harpes,</hi>

That your Willoughes are but barren Trees, and without fruit; and when Prayer
proceeds from a drie heart, and a barren and vnfruitfull soule, it is like the
Harpe there spoken of, that hangs vpon the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughes by the waters of

voyces of our desires. When the Deuill left <hi>Iobs</hi> lips onely free from
byles and sores, he did not doe it out of any pittie towards him, but out of a
desire that hee had to draw some word of impatience or blasphemie from them:
but he was both deceiued and ashamed, when he saw that he imployed them in
these only foure praise-worthie words, <hi>Sit nomen Domini benedictum, Blessed
be the name of the Lord.</hi> And say the Deuill should haue bereaued him of
the vse of his lips, and that he should not haue beene able to haue vttered a
word, yet his desires would haue spoken their mind in a loud voyce. <hi>Cum

Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> saith, That hee saw vnder the Alter the soules of the

these soules were seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from their bodies, how could they crie? Saint

<hi>Moses</hi> did not vnfold his lips, nor once open his mouth, and yet God
said vnto him, <hi>Why doost thou

off.</p>
            <p>Besides, Two things I would haue you to note, which are vsuall
with the Saints and children of God.</p>
            <p>The one, to set before their eyes the fauours they haue receiued,
to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge them, to shew themselues thankefull for them, and to praise and
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Gods fauours seldome come single.</note>The
other, Not to shew themselues forgetful of their seruices towards God; Knowing
that it is Gods condition and qualitie, when he bestoweth one fauour, to ingage
himselfe for a greater. <hi>Ezechias</hi> alledged vnto God his holinesse and
goodnesse of life:<note place="margin">4. <hi>Reg.</hi> 20.3.</note> O <hi>Lord,
remember now how I haue walked before theein truth and with a perfect heart,
and haue done that which is good <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n
thy sight.</hi> Saint <hi>Gregorie</hi> pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth hereupon; Were it not better
to alledge thy miserie, than to represent those many good things which thou
hast done, all which thou hast receiued from his hand? But with God, to alledge
them, and to shew our selues thankefull for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer receiued fauors, is a
powerfull meanes for the receiuing of far greater bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits and blessings from
him. After that <hi>Dauid</hi> had made a large muster of his tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations, He
sayth, <hi>Conuersus, viuificasti me, &amp; de abissis terrae, iterum reduxisti
me, Thou hast quickned mee, and hast brought mee againe from out the deepes of
the Earth.</hi> Where I would haue you to ponder the word <hi>iterum</hi>; For
God neuer does one single fauour.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The
  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous euer mind full of Gods
  seruice, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getful of their <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.</note>Secondly, the righteous
are forgetfull of their owne seruices, for that they hold them so meane and so
vile, that they iudge them vnworthy Gods sight. And when in that generall
iudgement God shall say, <hi>I was naked and yee couered me, &amp;c.</hi> The
Saints shall answere, <hi>Lord when did we see thee naked, &amp;c.</hi> And it
is noted by <hi>Theodoret,</hi> that these are not words of courtesie, or out
of mannerlines, but of meere forgetfulnesse. For it is their fashion, so to
despise their owne ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices and deseruings, that they doe wholy forget
them.</p>
            <p>The fourth consideration of their discretion was, That so
especiall is the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor <pb n="503" facs="tcp:22083:267"/> which God showes vnto his
friends; and the griefe which he conceiueth of any that shall befall them, that
they held it a greater point of Wisedome to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that hee was his friend,
than their brother. Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> sayth, That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the defect of my
seruices doe dishearten mee, yet Gods great mercies, and his many fauours doe
incourage mee: For it is not Gods fashion to forsake his friends.</p>
            <p>And therfore saith Saint <hi>Austen, Non enim amas &amp;
deseris.</hi> The Princes of the Earth are now and then well content, their
friends should suffer, because in them, Power and Loue is not equall: But those
in whom these attributes goe hand in hand, ought not to suffer their friends to
miscarrie. They would seeme here to put this vpon Christ, and to make this
cause his owne. O Lord, That wee should loose our brother, it is no great
losse, because in thee wee haue a brother: But thou (ô Lord) amongst so
many thy professed enemies, hast lost a great friend. It is the condition of
Gods Saints to greeue for the death of the Iust,<note place="margin">Iniuries
  done to God, more greeuous to the righteous, than if done to themselues.</note>
because God receiues a losse in them; and to resent their own proper iniuries,
not for that these iniuries are done to themselues, but for that they are
iniuries done vnto God. <hi>Tabescere me fecit zelus meus, quia obliti sunt
verba tua, inimici mei</hi>: Vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which place, <hi>Genebrard</hi> giues this
exposition, That mine owne iniuries, doe not so much offend mee for that they
are mine, but because they are offences done vnto thee. And <hi>Dauid</hi> in
his thirtith Psalme treateth of some crosses and affliction, that God by
sickenesse had layd vpon him, after he had built his pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces, <hi>Thou didst
hide thy face and I was troubled.</hi> I was loath to dye,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 39.</note> not for mine owne sake, for it were
happinesse to me if I should dye to day or to morrow, but not for thee,
<hi>What profit is there in my bloud, when I go downe to the pit?</hi> What
seruice can <hi>Dauid</hi> do thee, when he is layd in his sepulchre? But
ô Lord, in his life, in his honor, in his crowne, and in his kingdome, he
may do thee good seruice: This, ô Lord, concernes thee, and must runne to
thy account. The like bold insinuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on did <hi>Moses</hi> vse, when he said, O
Lord, pardon this people; lest the Aegypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans should say, Thou hadst plotted
this of purpose to lead them out into the Desert, and there to make an end of
them, hauing no bodie to helpe them. <hi>Tibi soli peccaui, &amp; malum coram
te feci, vt iustificeris in sermonibus tuis, &amp; vincas cum iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaris</hi>;
Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> giues it this interpretation, <hi>Tibi soli peccaui,
viz. Tibi solum sum relictus.</hi> O Lord, this wound was only made for thee,
that thou alone mightst heale it; all other Physitions haue quite giuen me
ouer, there is not any one vpon earth that knowes how to cure mee, and
therefore I lay the same open onely to thee, <hi>Vt iustificeris.</hi> Thou
hast ordained a Law, That at what time soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer a Sinner shall repent him of his
sinne, and turne vnto thee, thou wilt blot out his offences: O Lord, I am
sorrie I haue offended thee, I confesse my fault, and acknowledge my sinne
before thee, and therefore it must be put to thy account, to pardon me;
otherwise it wil be said of thee, That thou doost not comply with thy
promise.</p>
            <p>Secondly, These two sisters did pretend to strengthen this our
Sauiours loue to their brother.<note place="margin">No loue where no
  releefe.</note> For it doth not stand with the rules of friendship that a man
should loue, and not releeue the necessities of him he loueth. One telling
<hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrastus,</hi> That two such were very great friends, &amp; that the
one was very rich, and the other very poore; He returned him this answere, It
cannot bee, beeing they be friends. This very argument did these sisters vrge
our Sauiour Christ with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all: <hi>Lazarus</hi> beeing thy friend, and thou being
life it selfe, why hast thou suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Death to lay hold vpon him? Againe,
There is no force that is able to resist Death, but Loue, <hi>Loue is as strong
as Death.</hi> Death hath been so audacious as to <pb n="504" facs="tcp:22083:268"/> enter
within our doores; let Loue reuenge vs of this his presumption. The Athenians
placed Loues Statua betwixt <hi>Mercurie</hi> and <hi>Hercules,</hi> the one
the god of Eloquence, the other of Fortitude. To shew that Loue doth not
consist so much in wordes, as in workes. Thou hast vouchsafed, ô Lord, to
honour our brother with the name of friend, now manifest the same by thy strong
arme, and thy powerfull hand.</p>
            <p>The fifth, was their hauing recourse vnto him, that had caused
this wound and was onely able to cure it. First, for that God is highly
offended that we should haue recourse to any but himselfe. Secondly, Because no
Phisition, nor earthly phisick can minister health without the will and
pleasure of our heauenly Phisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>He woundeth, and he maketh whole.</hi>
The former is notified vnto vs in <hi>Ah<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ziah,</hi> who finding himselfe sore sicke of a fall through the
Lattice window of his vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per chamber: sent (fearing he should die of that
bruise) to consult with <hi>Baalzebub</hi> the god of Ekron. Which Messengers
<hi>Elias</hi> meeting withall, said vnto them; <hi>What is there no God in
Israel that yee goe to inquire of Baalzebub the god of Eckron?</hi>
               <note place="margin">4. <hi>Reg.</hi> 1.</note> deliuer therfore this message from God
vnto your king, <hi>Thou shalt not come down from the bed on which thou art

                  <hi>Osee</hi> 4.12.</note> 
               <hi>but shalt die
the death. Hosea</hi> doth likewise complaine, That his People had recourse in
their doubts vnto Idolls, <hi>My Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple aske councell at their stockes.
Lyrae</hi> renders it, <hi>In simulachro ligni.</hi> This my Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is so
foolish, that they goe to aske councell of a piece of wood. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentie
Interpreters turne it thus, <hi>In virgis suis</hi>: Whereupon
<hi>Rupertus</hi> hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued, That this was a kind of superstition which
cloue vnto them from the Chaldeans, from whom they had receiued this infection;
for it was a fashion amongst them, when they would know what should befall
them, to throw vp a couple of stickes as high as they could fling them; or two
arrows tied together, and marking the one for good lucke, and the other for
bad, they mumbled I know not what words, and that which in the falling fell
vppermost, did prognosticate the successe.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ezech.</hi>
  21.21.</note> 
               <hi>Ezechiel</hi> reporteth, That the King of Babylon comming
with a great armie, doubting with himselfe, whither he should goe against Rahab
or Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem, comming where there were two wayes to take, vsed this
superstition of the two Arrowes, <hi>Quaerens diuinationem.</hi> The King of
Babell stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two wayes,
consulting by diuination, and made his Arrowes bright, &amp;c. and the lot
lighted against Ierusalem. This difference there is betwixt him that is a Saint
of God, and him that is not; that he in his griefes hath recourse first vnto
God, and next to humane remedies; wheras the other hath first recourse vnto
Physitions: &amp; when they notifie to the former, the danger wherein he is, he
falls to a confession of his sins, a heartie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and to the receiuing
of the blessed Sacrament. The Antients did pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture Health in the forme of a
handsome faire Damosell sitting in a Royall Throne; for without health there is
no pleasure in royall Thrones, in Scepters, nor in Crownes: for the better
conseruation whereof, we are to vse temperance in our dyet. The Serpent is the
Symbole of Prudence, without which it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to preserue our health.
The foolish and vndiscreet man, that makes no reckoning of the falling of your
<hi>Sereno's,</hi> or euening dewes, oftentimes blasting those that are in
them; as in Spaine, and the like hot Countries; of your Sunnes heats, and your
Snowes colds, your foule and pockie Whores, loose oftentimes their healths, if
not their liues. But aboue all, we must haue recourse vnto God, for God is all
in all; and without God, little importeth temperance, prudence, Physitions, or
Physicke.</p>
            <p>The sixt consideration of their discretion, was, That they did
propose their <pb n="505" facs="tcp:22083:268"/> miserie, but not prescribe the remedie;
for it is sufficient, that we propound our necessitie vnto God. Saint
<hi>Augustine</hi> saith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Amanti, sat est nunciasse,</hi> It is enough
for him that loues, to intimate his mind. And Saint <hi>Bernard, Sic melius
tanquam non orantes, oramus; tanquam diffidentes; confidimus, &amp;c.</hi> A
modest kind of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding, and a diffident seeming confidence, doth oftentimes
further a suit, and promote the thing we pretend. <hi>Ezechias</hi> being
threatned by <hi>Zenacharib,</hi>
               <note place="margin">4. <hi>Reg.</hi> 19.</note>
did before God vnfold his menacing letter; O Lord, (sayd hee) thou maist read
in these lines the pride and arrogancie of this blaspheming King. Saint
<hi>Peter</hi> when his soule melted into teares, did not tell God what he
pretended by them; Which caused Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> to say, <hi>Lachrimas

doe myne owne will, but the will of my Father that sent me. Anselmus</hi>
saith, That a soueraigne will in man, and which doth not submit it selfe vnto
Gods will, is the will of Worldlings, and sauouring too much of the earth; and
this superioritie would (if it knew how) rob God of his priuiledges, as proud

there had neuer beene any Hell,<note place="margin">The peruerse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of mans

               <hi>in the day of your fast you will

Answered, That he was neuer wedded to his owne proper will. <hi>Taulerius</hi>
reporteth of a certaine Diuine, That he did oftentimes desire of God, That he
would direct him to a Master that might teach him the way of his saluation; and
that at last he met with a poore man that was all ragged and torne: God giue
you the good day, said he vnto him: To whom the other replied, I neuer had bad
one yet: What meanest thou by that, quoth he? He told him, I did euer place my
happinesse and content in submitting my wil to Gods wil; and because his will
diuides it selfe into good and euill, contenting my selfe with his good will
and pleasure, I haue alwayes led a contented life. But what (said he) woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
thou doe, if God should cast thee into Hell? He answered, My Soule hath two
armes; the one of Humilitie, the other of Charitie: with the one I would obey;
with the other I would take hold on God himselfe, and would force him to
descend downe with me into Hell; and hauing him along with me, I should enioy
all happinesse and content. <hi>Leo</hi> the Pope saith, That the dispossession

  ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration and wondring, <hi>Ah my Lord, If the Lord be with vs, why then is
  all this euill come vpon vs?</hi> This is a secret hidden from the eyes of the
  flesh; wherein we are to acknowledge these two truths:</p>
               <p>The one, That Tribulation conserueth Vertue.</p>
               <p>The other, That God giues tribulation to his best friends, as a
  reward of their great and good seruices.</p>
               <p>Touching the former, In that earthly Paradise, Vertue was
  conserued in it's perfect rest and quiet, because the goods of the bodie did
  concurre with the goods of the soule. But this concord was broken through
  sinne; and then ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, amidst it's ease and pleasure, liued in greater
  danger; but in it's tribulation, in greater securitie. <hi>Caietan</hi> saith,
  That the certainest and most assured signe that Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues are such strangers
  here vpon earth, is, for that they haue need of so many materialls of
  persecutions for their preseruation. Fire being in it's own sphere, is solely
  by it selfe conserued without any fuell to maintaine it, or breath of aire to
  blow it: the like succeedeth with Vertue.</p>
               <p>Touching the second, Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith of
  <hi>Iob,</hi> That before the stormes of affliction fell vpon him, he was a
  holy man; yet for all that had he not the reward of holy,<note place="margin">The
 best re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward that God can giue his followers</note> 
                  <hi>Virtutis praemium non

  himselfe a valiant souldier in peace, but not a Conquerour in warre; and that
  his troubles and afflictions bestowed vpon him the Palme of this his victorie.
  He saith likewise of <hi>Ioseph,</hi> That the temptation of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse
  clapt the Crowne of Chastitie vpon his head; and the wrong he receiued by
  imprisonment, was the Touch-stone of his valour. Your earthly Crownes are made
  of gold, but your heauenly Diadems, of the thornes of tribulation; <hi>Necesse
  fuit, vt tentatio probaret te, It was needfull that thou shouldst be tried by

                  <hi>This sickenesse is not vnto death, but for the glorie of

  that doth cure them; that great and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble tempests recommend the Pilots
  skill that can preserue the Ship amidst those cruell flawes and raging seas;
  that great victories innoble the Captaines that obtaine them, is a manifest and
  knowne truth: but that those stormes which pricke and paine my feet, should
  serue for flowers in Gods hands; that those stones whereat I stumble, should
  serue as Diamonds for his Crowne; this is a hidden treasure, and a secret
  mysterie of heauenly Phylosophie; but so certain, that in case God had not
  created the world for any other end than to throw tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations vpon his
  friends, it had beene a famous piece of worke, and a most glorious Fabricke:
  for so great is the glorie which a Saint drawes from his suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, that he
  makes no reckoning of the paine that he indures. And it is fitly tearmed
  glorie, for that all our felicitie consisteth in the seeing of God,
  Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation openeth the eyes of the Soule, whereby wee come to see him the
  better, <hi>Vexatio dat intellectum,</hi> It is a kind of glorie to suffer
  affliction. Heretofore (sayd <hi>Iob</hi>) <hi>Auditu auris audiuite, nunc

  knowledge of thee; but now in my miserie sitting on the dunghill, I haue seene
  thee with myne eyes</hi>; I find a great difference between that which I heard,
  and that which I now see. Not that he saw God, (saith Saint
  <hi>Chrysostome</hi>) but because his knowledge was by his miserie made more
  cleere. After that man had fallen by sinne, God gaue that to him for a
  punishment, which before he had bestowed vpon him for entertainement: He had
  placed him in Paradise, to dresse &amp; keepe <pb n="507" facs="tcp:22083:269"/> it;
  afterwards he allotted it him as a chastisement, <hi>In the sweat of thy

  his fauour, Heauen: but trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and affliction sent vs by God, is like vnto
  <hi>Moses</hi> his Bush, which the more it flamed, the fresher it seemed; for
  (as it is obserued by Saint <hi>Gregorie</hi>) the fire did serue there in
  stead of water: Suting with that of Saint <hi>Paul, Licet is qui foris est,
  noster homo corrumpatur</hi>; for by how much the more the bodie is dried vp
  and withered away, by so much the more doth the soule grow greene and flourish;
  and by how much the more the outward man waxeth weake, by so much the more the
  inward man waxeth strong.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For the glorie of God, &amp;c.</hi> Before your great
  battells are fought, they first begin with skirmishes; in your Tilts and
  Tournaments they begin with proffers and flourishes; betweene Loue and Death,
  after eithers brauado's, the warre is now ended: Loue skirmisheth with Death,
  and hath gotten himselfe such great glorie in this conflict, that with a
  generall shouting all crie out aloud, That Loue will win the field. There are
  many, who not truly looking into the cause of their punishment, crie out with

  of those many stripes which God had laid vpon me.</hi> But to al this it may be
  answered, That the cause thereof is the glorie of God. The stench vapours it
  selfe from forth the earth, it inuirons the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumuicining aire; the Wormes
  are knawing on <hi>Lazarus</hi> carkasse: all this loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somenesse, this

               <p>
                  <hi>That Mary which annoynted the Lord with oyntment,
  &amp;c.</hi> The titles whereby the Spirit of God makes these Sisters, and
  their brother knowne, are those their seruices expressed to our Sauiour Christ.
  <hi>Mary,</hi> who annoynted his feet, <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha</hi> who feasted him; and
  <hi>Lazarus,</hi> his beloued friend. For the greatest noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse that a soule
  can inioy, is, To serue and loue God; <hi>Feare God and keepe his
  Commandements, &amp;c.</hi> This is the onely true valour in man.
  <hi>Philon</hi> expounding that place vpon Genesis, <hi>These are the
  generations of Noah, &amp;c.</hi> He saith, That God willed <hi>Moses</hi> to
  make a Pedegree or Genealogie of <hi>Noah,</hi> but hee did not make it by
  fetching it from his famous ancestors, as your Noblemen and Gentlemen doe now a
  dayes, but from his Vertues. Those forefathers, and great grandfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which
  made <hi>Noah</hi> so renowned, were his obedience, his constancie, his
  fortitude, and his pietie. This is the true nobilitie of Gods Saints. The
  diuine Histories that blazons foorth <hi>Iob,</hi> describes him thus,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iob.</hi> 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Hee was an vpright and iust man, one
  that feared God, and eschued euill, &amp;c.</hi> But why did hee not make
  menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Fathers and his Kindred and Alliance? Because Gods Saints,
  boast not their parentage, but their vertue. Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi>
  prooueth at large, that a man ought not to be commended for any thing, but his
  vertue. And hee rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth three very good reasons for it.</p>
               <p>The first is, That all other our goods end with our liues;<note place="margin">Nothing more properly ours, than Vertue.</note> but vertue
  indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth for euer. The rest are <hi>bona aliena,</hi> they are not ours, but
  of others. But ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, is <hi>bonum proprium, It is our owne proper good.</hi>
  And Saint <hi>Chrisostome</hi> treating of <hi>Nabuchadnezzars</hi> Statua,
  much condemneth the meanes that was vsed for the increasing of his honour, and
  authoritie: For he dishonoured himselfe by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that to be honoured; shewing
  thereby, that he relied more vpon a Statue of mouldring mettalls, than his owne
  bodie and soule: representing those therein, that are honoured more in the
  world for those outward goods of the body, than those inward goods of the
  soule; confessing as it were, that because they haue <pb n="508" facs="tcp:22083:270"/> not
  any thing in them that deserueth honour, they erect them Statues to bee
  adored.</p>
               <p>The second, None of all these exteriour goods doth satisfie the
  soule, but Vertue fills the Vessell of mans heart. Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi>
  interpreting that verse of <hi>Dauid, Accedite ad Deum, &amp;
  illuminamini,</hi> (id est) <hi>illuminabimini</hi>; addeth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto,
  <hi>Accedite, &amp; satiamini; accedite, &amp; liberamini; accedite, &amp;
  dimittemini: Come vnto God, and yee shall be illightned, for he is the Light;
  come vnto him, and yee shall be satisfied, for he is the Bread of life; come
  vnto him yee that are thirstie, for he is the Fountaine of liuing waters; come
  vnto him and be freed, for he is freedome it selfe; come vnto him yee that
  desire pardon, for he is the Remission of sinnes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">In all humane goods the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures haue the
 start of man.</note>The third, These humane goods are so base and so vile, that
  none can truly commend them. Art thou bold? A Lyon is more bold than thou. Art
  thou strong? A Beare is farre stronger: Art thou beautiful? a Peacocke goes
  beyond thee: Art thou braue and gallant? A Horse in his rich Caparisons is a
  more glorious sight: Liuest thou in great Pallaces? a Iackedaw, nay a Spider
  liues in greater and farre more sumptuous: Art thou a curious Workeman? The Bee
  is a better: Art thou nimble of bodie? The Hart is more: Hast thou a good eye?
  The Eagle hath a quicker: Hast thou a quicke sent, euerie Dog will out-nose
  thee: Art thou a good husband? The Ant is a better. It is a shame therefore
  that thou shouldst boast thy selfe of those things wherein the bruit beasts do
  sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe thee. In a word, it did stead <hi>Lazarus</hi> more to be our Sauiour
  Christs friend, than nobly borne, or antiently descended.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The goodnes of Gods con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition toward
 Penitents, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed two manner of wayes. First, he neuer remembers their
 sinnes. <hi>Esay</hi> 38.17.</note>
                  <hi>Which annointed his feet with
  oyntment.</hi> Here are two truths touching the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of Gods condition,
  pointed forth vnto vs:</p>
               <p>The first, That during all the time of <hi>Marie Magdalens</hi>
  perdition and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanenesse, there is not the least print or shew in Gods booke
  concerning any such matter, nor any memorie thereof remaining vpon Record;
  Marrie the World calls her <hi>Maria la Peccadora, Marie the Sinner,</hi> and
  represents nothing else vnto vs but her sinnes: but God doth not so, nay he
  doth not so much as thinke vpon them, or once offer to call them to mind.
  <hi>Projecisti post tergum tuum,</hi> (It was the saying of good King
  <hi>Ezechias) omnia peccata mea, Thou hast cast all my sinnes behind thy
  backe.</hi> It is a Spanish phrase, <hi>Echar al trançado,</hi> of that
  which is no more to be seene. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> expounding that place of
  <hi>Ieremie, Ecce, ego obducam ei cicatricem</hi>; saith, That the Chyrurgeon
  cureth the wound, but doth not take away the skarre, but there is some marke
  thereof still remaining; but God not onely cures the wound, but therewithall
  quite quits the signe, as if there had neuer beene any such thing at all. Saint
  <hi>Chrysostome</hi> addeth hereunto, <hi>Cum sani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate reliquit
  pulchritudinem:</hi> Nor shall it bee an excesse of speech, to affirme, That
  <hi>Marie Magdalens</hi> repentance made her appeare more faire and beautifull
  than Saint <hi>Agnes</hi> the Martyr, S. <hi>Agatha,</hi> or S.
  <hi>Cicile.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Secondly, hee neuer forgets our seruices.
 <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.</note>The second is, That God neuer blotteth out of his
  remembrance those serui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that he receiueth from vs, nor will suffer his
  friends to bee forgotten: And therefore our Sauiour saith touching this sinfull
  woman, <hi>Verily I say vnto you, wheresoeuer this Gospell shall be preached
  throughout the whole world, there shall also this that she hath done, be spoken
  of for a memorial of her</hi>; yee may chance to forget it, but God will not.
  Your Kings nominate Chroniclers to write downe the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices of their Vassalls,
  and the famous acts of the valiant and stout men of war; <hi>Iosaphat</hi> the
  sonne of <hi>Eliud</hi> (as we may read in the booke of the <hi>Kings</hi>)
  <hi>erat à Commentarijs,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. <hi>Reg.</hi>
 8.16.</note> 
                  <hi>was the Chronicler.</hi> But Kings either not read them, or
  soone forget them: In <hi>Assuerus</hi> his Annals is set downe the good
  seruice which <hi>Mardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chee</hi> 
                  <pb n="509" facs="tcp:22083:270"/> had done him, by
  freeing his life from a treason that was plotted against him; but
  <hi>Assuerus</hi> had quite forgot it. But God is so farre from forgetting such
  seruices, that he vseth to assume vnto himselfe a name from the seruice that
  they doe him: he said vnto <hi>Iacob,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi>
 31.13. <hi>Malach.</hi> 3.16.</note> 
                  <hi>I am the God of Bethel where thou
  annointedst the Piller, where thou vowedst a Vow vnto me.</hi> Corresponding
  with that of <hi>Malachie, Scriptus est liber monumenti coram eo, And a booke
  of remembrance was written.</hi> Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother letter hath it
  <hi>Recordationis,</hi> agreeing with the common Translation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Our friend Lazarus sleepeth, &amp;c.</hi> What a strange
  kind of thing is this, that <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi> being dead should find friends?
  For it is the course of the world, to hold him our friend that liues in
  plentie, prosperitie, and enioyes his health; but not that a sicke man, nay a
  dead man, should find a friend, &amp;c. <hi>Iob</hi> made it his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint,
  <hi>My friends and familiar acquaintance forsooke me, and would not looke vpon
  me in my miserie</hi>: And he drawes his comparison of their sudden departure,
  from those downefalls of water in the Winter, which glide away with all the
  speed that may be. <hi>Salomon</hi> compares them to a rotten tooth, and a
  wearie foot. The Harlot is likewise the hierogliphycke of false friends; whose
  embraces and kis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses are like those of <hi>Iudas,</hi> for money: your
  Quicke-siluer is likewise a simbole of the same, which forsaketh the gold in
  the Chrisoll; these are all of them things that faile in the time of need. The
  World hath not any one thing wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it is more vnmindfull, than the Dead;
  <hi>Obliuioni datus sum, tanquam mortuus à corde,</hi> O, that the Dead
  should be forgotten by that heart which gaue it life! and that he should be
  forgotten by his friend, who placed him in honour and in ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. In a word, by
  how much the more miserie increaseth in the world, by so much the more
  friendship decreaseth. Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> saith, That the best friend
  that euer was, ascended vp vnto Heauen. Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> That a friend
  is like a Physition that loues the Patient, and hates his disease; but if Death
  come betwixt him and home, his skill is at an end; for he that can recouer
  health, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not recouer life: this is onely reserued for our Sauiour Christ,
  who is <hi>Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum vitae, &amp; immortalitatis gratia.</hi> This
  Physition stiles <hi>Lazarus,</hi> his friend, in health, in sickenesse, and in
  death. <hi>Manus eius tornatiles.</hi> That Artificer which leuels his worke by
  his eye, commonly goes crookedly to worke, and commits many disproportions; but
  he that workes in a wheele as Turners doe, or in a Presse as your Printers,
  keepes a continuall euenesse and equalitie, in sickenesse and in health, in
  prosperitie and aduersitie, in Winter and in Sommer; and such an Artisan was
  our Sauiour Christ in all his actions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Our friend Lazarus sleepeth, &amp;c.</hi> It is an ordinarie
  Language in Scripture,<note place="margin">Death, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther temporall or
 spirituall, called a Sleep, &amp; that fitly.</note> to call Death, Sleepe;
  whither it be the death of the soule, or the bodie. To him that was dead in the
  soule, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Arise thou that sleepest, &amp;c.</hi>
  Some sinners are so sound asleepe, that neither lights, loud calling, nor
  shogging of them can awaken them; <hi>Percussi eos, &amp; non doluerunt, I
  smote them, and they grieued not.</hi> Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> confesseth of
  himselfe, That he lay long in this Lethargy; and descending to vices in
  particuler, he saith, That God calling vpon your Theeues, for to haue them to
  make restitution; vpon your reuengefull natures, that they should not seeke
  reuenge; and vpon your Sensualists, that they should leaue off this their
  beastly course of life: some of them answer, That they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not; others, That
  they dare not. Other Sinners there are that heare God in their sleepe, taking
  their dreames to be reuelations; considering with themselues, That God is woont
  to speake in dreames and in visions;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iob.</hi> 33.</note>
                  <hi>For God speaketh once or twice in dreames and visions of the night, when
  sleepe falleth vpon men,</hi> and they sleepe vpon their beds, then he openeth
  the eares of men by the corrections which <pb n="510" facs="tcp:22083:271"/> he had sealed,
  that he might cause man to turne away from his wickednesse, that he might hide
  the pride of man, and that his life should not passe by the Sword.</p>
               <p>The death likewise of the bodie, is, and that verie fittingly,
  termed sleepe.</p>
               <p>First, For the rest that they take: The Phylosophers called it

                     <hi>Iud.</hi> 3.</note>Secondly, For the
  danger wherein it leaueth sinners: <hi>Holofernes</hi> layd him downe to
  sleepe, fully persuading himselfe, that he should haue enioyed <hi>Iudith</hi>
  in his armes when he awaked; but alas poore soule, before euer hee was aware of
  it,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 20.</note> he found himselfe in Hell.
  <hi>Abimilecke</hi> got him to bed, with hope to haue his pleasure of
  <hi>Saraah,</hi> but in the dead time of the night he found himselfe in the
  hands of an angrie God. To the rich man that inuited his soule to take his
  fill,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.</note> for there was store enough for
  many yeares, <hi>Hac nocte, &amp;c. This night shall thy soule be taken from
  thee. Saul</hi> slept verie soundly and carelessely in his Tent, when
  <hi>Dauid</hi> might haue giuen him his passeport for another life.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Reg.</hi> 2.6.</note> And therefore no man ought to lay him
  downe to sleepe with lesse heedfulnesse, than if hee were now lying on his
  death bed. Your wretchlesse sinners feele a harder passage of it, and farre
  greater torment than the Iust. Death vseth to bring great torments with it:
  First, In seperating the soule from the bodie. Secondly, In forgoing those
  things it loueth, as gold, siluer, lands, houses, wife and children, which are
  all of them strings whereunto the heart is tied; besides the venture of our
  condemnation for euer, and the agonie of so many feares that will in this
  disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution seise vpon vs. From all which the Righteous, though they threaten
  him neuer so much, remaineth free and vntoucht.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Christs passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons differing from
 ours.</note>
                  <hi>He groaned in the spirit, &amp;c.</hi> The Greeke word
  signifieth to roare, to crie out aloud, to waile, to lament, and to be much
  mooued: According to that of <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philact, Et turbauit semetipsum, And was
  troubled in himselfe</hi>: It did awaken in the sensitiue part of him, those
  affections or passions, which (as <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith) are like vnto dogs,
  who in hearing any noyse, fall presently a barking till that their Master do
  still them &amp; make them hold their peace. In vs it is a kind of
  imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, because these affections or passions fall a balling without any
  reason in the world, and no iust occasion being giuen. But in our Sauior
  Christ, these passions were not without cause, as Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> hath
  noted it, Saint <hi>Gregorie,</hi> and Saint <hi>Hierome</hi>; neither can they
  presse him further than hee is pleased to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them. If here our anger take
  hold vpon vs, it is like a fierce mastiffe, which being set on by his Master,
  takes hold on the Bul, and will not let him go, though he be rated off againe
  and againe. In conclusion, two things doth here recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend themselues vnto
  vs.</p>
               <p>The one, That our Sauiour Christ was angrie.</p>
               <p>The other, That he was mooued to much compassion.</p>
               <p>His anger was occasioned through the Iewes incredulitie, (as it
  is noted by Cardinall <hi>Tolet</hi> and <hi>Caietane</hi>) whose hardnesse and
  vnbeleefe was such, that hee was forced to take <hi>Lazarus</hi> his life from
  him, to disconsolate those two kind Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, to draw teares from their eyes,
  and sobs from their brest, and afterwards to returne himagaine vnto the world,
  and onely that some might be drawne to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ue. Saint <hi>Cyril</hi> saith, That this his anger was against
  Death and the Deuill, as if he had threatned their ouerthrow, and vowed their
  destruction; as it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecied by <hi>Osee, O mors, ero mors tua, O death, I
  will be thy death. &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="511" facs="tcp:22083:271"/>
                  <hi>Vbi posuistis eum? Where haue yee laid
  him? &amp;c.</hi> O Lord, Why shouldst thou aske this question?</p>
               <p>I answer, That he did it for two reasons.</p>
               <p>The one, The countenance of a Sinner is so strangely changed,
  and is so strangely altered from what he was before he fell sicke of sinne,
  that it is a phrase of Scripture to say, God doth not know him. Thou lendest
  thy friend thy Horse or thy Cloake, the one is returned to thee so lame and so
  leane, the other so ill vsed and so vtterly spoyled, that not knowing thyne
  owne, thou sayest, This is not that which I lent. Of an vntowardly and
  vngratious sonne the father will vsually say, He is none of my sonne; so said
  God to the foolish Virgins, and to those that had wrought myracles in his name,
  <hi>Nescio vos, I know yee not.</hi> Your Robbers on the Highway disfigure the
  faces of those whom they rob and murder, to the end they may not be knowne. And
  there is nothing that makes the Soule fouler, than Sin, <hi>Denigrata est
  facies eorum super carbones</hi>: and it beeing so faire &amp; beautifull
  before, it is no great meruaile that God should not know it. So that now our
  Sauiour seemes not to know the place, there being so great a difference
  betweene the one place and the other [that of the life of Grace, and that of
  the death of Sinne] that he here askes, <hi>Vbi posuistis eum? Where haue yee
  layd him?</hi> Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> alledgeth, That hee vsed the like
  question when hee called vnto <hi>Adam,</hi> saying, <hi>Adam, Adam, vbi es?
  Adam, where are thou?</hi> I find thee in a different place from that wherein I
  put thee; I placed thee in prosperity and content, and I find thee now in
  wretchednesse and in miserie: Who caused this so great an alteration in thee?
  Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> saith, That this question was made more to the Sinne
  than to the Sisters; and that <hi>Lazarus</hi> representing Mankind, he said,
  (speaking of our sinnes) <hi>Vbi posuistis eum? Where haue yee layd him?</hi> I
  pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him in Paradice, and yee haue put him in the graue. The like is
  reported by <hi>Petrus Crysologus</hi>; and he calleth the Graue, the Caue
  wherein the Deuill hides his thefts: and because the beginning of all this
  harme proceeded from woman, he asketh the Sisters, <hi>Vbi posuistis eum? Where
  haue yee layd him?</hi> For there are many women (God hauing placed man in
  honour, happinesse, and health) which bring man to his graue.</p>
               <p>The other, A Sinner through sinne is remooued so farre from
  God,<note place="margin">Sin discoasts a man fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God.</note> (<hi>in Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem
  longinq<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>am</hi>) that God askes,
  where he is? For if it were possible for man to hide himselfe from the
  all-seeing eye of God, doubtlesse he would hide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in the land of
  Darkenesse, that is, of Sinne. And therefore it is said,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Psal.</hi> 1.6.</note> 
                  <hi>The Lord knoweth the way of the
  Righteous, and the way of the Wicked shall perish.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And Iesus wept.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Reasons why Christ
 wept.</note> Of this sheding of teares wee haue rendred many reasons elsewhere:
  Those which now offer themselues are these:</p>
               <p>The first is of Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> and Saint
  <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> who say, That Christ was mooued to weepe, by seeing
  <hi>Marie</hi> and <hi>Martha</hi> weepe. Christ seeing the Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of Naim
  weepe, said vnto her, <hi>Noli flere, Weepe not</hi>; and in the house of the
  chiefe Ruler of the Synagogue, he sought to diuert their teares; and yet heere
  these of <hi>Marie</hi> seeme to extort by force the falling of these teares
  from his tender eyes. <hi>Marie</hi> had accustomed her selfe to talke with our
  Sauior in this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ind of Language, it
  being a Cypher which onely our Sauiour vnderstood; and because she talked to
  him in teares, he answers her in teares. The exhalations of <hi>Maries</hi>
  heart ascend vp to the heauen of Christs eyes; and these humane teares draw
  downe diuine teares, obtaining that by grace which was impossible for na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
  to compasse.</p>
               <p>The second is of Saint <hi>Hilarie</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius,</hi>
  who affirme, That he thinking <pb n="512" facs="tcp:22083:272"/> on the obstinacie of the
  Iewes, and their finall perdition, brake forth thus into teares. For no man can

  ô Lord, can so truly bewaile sinne, as thy selfe. And it seeming to our
  Sauiour Christ, that two eyes were too little to lament their miserie, he added
  fiue wounds, which serued as so many weeping eyes, not shed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding water, but
  bloud. Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> saith, That in the Garden our Sauior did sweat

  this word <hi>Quatriduanus,</hi> his foure dayes lying in the graue. The
  Euangelists make mention of three dead persons which our Sauiour raised vp to
  life: not that he had not raised vp more, but because these doe represent the
  deaths of our soules. The daughter of the chiefe Ruler of the Synagogue which
  went not out of her house,<note place="margin">A threefold death of the

  roomes, and the closest by-cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners about the house: The young man of Naim,
  those publique sinnes which proclaime themselues in the Market place, and
  comming out of doores, offer themselues to euerie mans view, your widows sonnes
  being generally lewd and ill giuen: <hi>Lazarus,</hi> those that stinke and
  grow vnsauorie through their too long custome of sinning, hauing lien long in
  this graue of death. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, That the name of three, in
  Scripture, betokeneth many sinnes; but that of foure, more than many. And this
  phrase of speech is vsed by <hi>Amos,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Whence it is to be noted,<note place="margin">Gods loue seene by
 the delayes he vseth in his punishing.</note> That sins when they begin like
  the waters to swell so high, they leaue their bed and run ouer the bankes,
  causing a miserable inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation. Gods anger growing wearie in the expectation
  of our amendment, draws his sword at last to cut vs off. The sinnes of Sodome
  cried out so loud, that the clamor thereof came to Gods eare; so shril was the
  noyse, that it brake through those other inferiour heauens, and ascended vp to
  the Throne of Thrones, where he sate in his Imperiall Maiestie. God was
  wondrous angrie at it, yet had hee this patience with himselfe, that before he
  would execute his wrath vpon them, he said, <hi>Vadam &amp; videbo, I will goe

                     </gap>.</note> of thy loue, than these thy delayes? God did beare with
  them yet a little while longer, and hee did looke and stand waiting to see
  whether Sodome would amend the foulenesse of her sinne: so that when hee came
  downe to see how things passed, had he found them sorrowfull for what they had
  done amisse, and repenting themselues of their former euill life, hee would
  haue sheathed his sword, and withdrawne his displeasure. The same conceit
  passeth in that Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the Tares; the Tares grew vp amongst the Wheat, and
  the seruants as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their Master, <hi>Wilt thou that we goe and plucke vp the
  tares?</hi> He said vnto them, <hi>No, let them grow vp both together.</hi> And
  why so, ô Lord? It may be they wil die and wither away of themselues; if
  not, the haruest will come ere long, and they shall be cut downe, bound vp, and
  cast into the ouen. So that Gods patience, you see, is great; but when we
  perseuer in ill, Gods anger comes like an inundation <pb n="514" facs="tcp:22083:273"/>
  vpon vs. But I will conclude this point with Saint <hi>Austens</hi> owne
  conclusion, <hi>Sub tali resuscitatore, de nullo iacente desperandum est, Let
  no man despaire of rising, be he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer so much cast downe, hauing such a one
  to raise him vp from Death to Life,</hi> as our Sauiour Christ Iesus, who is
  all Loue, and Mercie, and Goodnesse, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection of all those that

               <p>
                  <hi>He stinketh alreadie. Martha</hi> here showed herselfe of

  Christ. Giuing vs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to vnderstand, That a sinner sauours ill to all the
  world, but not to Gods no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sthrils. When God shewed vnto <hi>Peter</hi> the
  sheet full of snakes, and lizards, and willed him to eate, it caused a verie
  great horrour in him: But vnderstanding af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, that the mysterie was in
  that which was signified thereby, and not in the doing of it, hee did
  acknowledge that there was not that sinner vpon earth, that was cast out from
  Gods bosome. You may come to be loathsome vnto your selfe,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iob.</hi> 7.</note> but not vnto God, <hi>I am a burthen vnto

  gratious vnto him, and looked fauourably vpon him. My flesh is clothed with
  wormes and filthinesse of the dust, my skinne is rent and become horrible; I
  cannot indure the ill sauour that I beare about me; I haue not eyes to behold
  mine owne wretchednesse. But God hath an eye to looke vpon thee, and a heart to
  indure thee, and loues thee more than thou lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest thy selfe. Those fiue and
  twentie young men which <hi>Ezechiel</hi> painteth forth clapping nosegaies to
  their noses, some say that it was to defend them from the euill sauour, as if
  they should haue giuen <hi>Iob</hi> a pomander to drowne the stench of his
  sores, beeing on the one side nothing but plaisters, and noisome vnctions, and
  onthe other amber, and muske. But <hi>Isidorus Cladius</hi> reads,
  <hi>Applicant odorem malum ad nares meos.</hi> They turne their eyes towards
  the Sunne, and putting their faces from mee, they seeke to auoid the euill
  sauour that comes from mee. The translation of <hi>Ionathas</hi> doth fauour
  this conceit, <hi>Obuertebant podicum faciebus eo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</hi> In the honour of
  their Idols, and in their scorne of mee, they did vse the greatest inciuilitie
  could be offered vnto any. They are a stampe and embleme of those sinners
  before whom Vertue, and Holinesse of life sauoureth ill; but the myre of Vice
  and Sinne smelleth sweet. We know that the sauour of God is a sweet smelling
  sauour: <hi>Christi bonus odor sumus, We are a sweet smelling sauour vnto
  Christ.</hi> His name is a precious balme; His garments smell of sweetnesse.
  But as vnto weake eyes the Sunne is hatefull; so to a depraued sent, this
  sweete odour is vnsauourie. Yet God will not take a loathing at sinners, though
  like <hi>Lazarus,</hi> they lye stinking in their graues. For, albeit their
  sinnes doe offend his nosthrils, yet will hee not turne away his eye from a
  sinner, nor pull backe his hand from the dressing and curing of him. And as the
  father is not squemish and queasie stomacht, to helpe his child that is falne
  into the myre, and is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing all ouer but filth and dyrt, but doth take him
  vp and comfort him, and wash him, and cloths him cleanlier and neater than he

Prophet; others, That he was Christ: but the Pharisees perseuering in their
hardnesse, said, It is not possible that so much good should come out of
Galilee. But this dust was layd with that plea of the Adulteresse, putting the
matter into their owne hands, leauing it to themselues, to iudge her whom they
had so maliciously accused. This businesse beeing ended, Christ went on with
his Sermon, and spake againe vnto them saying, <hi>Ego sum lux Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di, &amp;c.

heard of him, and declare vnto you, That God is Light.</hi> Of this Light, the
Scripture telleth strange things.</p>
            <p>The first, That it is inaccessible; according to that of Saint
<hi>Paul, Hee dwelleth in the light that none can attaine vnto. Aristotle</hi>
saith,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.16.</note> That the cleerest eyes
are in order and disposition to this Light; as the eyes of the Owle in respect
of the Sun: the chiefest and the highest of Angells, hath need of more abilitie
for the light of this glorie, that his eyes may not be dazeled with the beams
of this Light.</p>
            <p>The second, That whatsoeuer light or beautie is to bee found in
the World, is wholly deriued from this Light; the Moone, the Starres, the
Planets, and the coelestiall Orbes. <hi>Dionysius</hi> saith, That they receiue
their light and splendour from the Sunne; and that the Sunne, and all that is
aboue the Sunne, Angells, Arch-Angells, Thrones, Powers, Principalities,
Dominations, &amp;c. And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer is contained in Heauen and Earth, receiue
their motion and light from this Light.</p>
            <p>The third, That if the Light should faile, the World were nothing
worth; for then the life and being of the World could not subsist; the
creatures, the fruits, the Elements, the actions of men, the birds and beasts,
without this light were not able to last and continue.</p>

raising vp their hanging heads, holpen by the dew of Heauen; the Flowers and
the Roses discouering the beautie of their faces; the singing of the Birds,
which with their musicke entertaine the light; the bleating of the Kids and
Lambekins, the Heardsman going forth with his Cattell, the Faulkener with his
Hawkes, and the Huntsman with his Hounds; What discomfort on the contrarie must

his Creatures, hee did cheare and cleere the Elements, he did banish
darkenesse, he gaue those goodly and liuely colours to the whole Vniuerse, and
all of them ioyntly remained so jocond, so merrie, and so well pleased, that in
their dumbe kind of Language they gaue great thankes to that Light. Man
remained in a Chaos no lesse darke, through sinne; and those that had the best
sight, did confesse, <hi>Wee groaped, like blind men, against a wall at noone
day.</hi> God did prepare great Lights for to rid away this grosse Darkenesse,
as Patriarkes, Prophets, Kings, and famous Captaines: but as in the darkenesse
of Aegypt, <hi>That bright flame of the Starres could not illighten that

(though most excellent) cleere Lights could not expell that darkenesse. God for
to repayre his Peoples discomfort, did promise to giue them a great Light;
<hi>The People that sate in darkenesse saw a great Light,</hi> That is, <hi>The

weepe, lament, sigh, and mourne; all the Creatures at last, remained so
perfect, so prosperous, and so rich, and held themselues so hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie, that
cloathing themselues with new ioy, they gaue the good day to this Light. The
Histories are full of those prodigies and wonders which hapned at our Sauiours

Father did not send this Torch into the world to put it vnder a bushell, and
therefore you need not to be so angrie, or thinke you are wronged. One of the
fearefullest accidents that euer was or shall be seene, was, That the Light

and as hee that is asleepe is offended when the light awakes him, and as weake
&amp; infirme eyes cannot indure the beames of the Sunne; so these Pharisees
were offended and grew verie hot and angrie, that the glorious Light of our
Sauiour Christ should discouer their sinnes.</p>
            <p>Some man perhaps may aske, whence this hatred growes? Saint
<hi>Iohn</hi> resolues it thus, As in the naturall World,<note place="margin">The
  reason why some hate and shunne it.</note> amongst birdes and beasts there are
many that cannot indure the light of the day, &amp; comming in the night out of
their caues &amp; holes, seeke their food in darkenes, according to the
Prophet, <hi>They seeke it from God</hi>; But when the Sun begins to peep
forth, he shuts them vp in their dennes, and makes them affraid to show their
heads: so in the Morall World, there are chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of darkenes and of the
night, which cannot abide the light of the day, <hi>That their Actions may not
be called into question.</hi> The night is the sinners cloake; The Light, the
Herald that proclaimes all humane Actions; &amp; such are those of these men,
that they haue not the face to come abroad, or to stand in the light. And
therefore whilest our Sauior Christ was writing on the ground with his finger
the sins of those that accused the Adulteresse, they sneaked thence, and
shrunke away one by one, <hi>Vnus post vnum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It seemeth a thing impossible, that the Light beeing so louely and
so ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, so faire and so beautifull, that any man should hate and abhorre
it, and curse and damne it to the pit of Hell. But it should seeme (me thinkes)
much more impossible, that this Light beeing God himselfe, that mans eye should
find any thing in it, that may draw on a dislike and hatred thereunto. But
Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the distasted palat of a sinner, saith, <hi>They

standing Pooles; high bankes, to bee euen ground; and that which is far off, to

a widow for a maid, a maid for a married wife, the mistresse for the maid, the
knight for his foot-man, and the church-man for a whoores champion. All is

seuerall wayes, and thou meetest with no man; the day appeares, the light
ouercomes the darkenesse, but not thy doubting of the way, and therefore thou
hadst need to haue a guide. In this iourney of mans life, there are two wayes;
The one the narrow way, that leads vnto Heauen, the other the broad way that
leades vnto Hell; the one to good, the other to ill. The light that dispelleth
the darkenesse, will not serue the turne, but wee must likewise haue a guide to

painefull greefe, and ease me of my heauy load; for whatsoeuer I say or doe, is
for me a doubtfull question, <hi>Et ipse est languor meus.</hi> As necessitie
doth alledge for her part, that it is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie <pb n="521" facs="tcp:22083:276"/> to
eat, for to liue; for if our naturall heat did not find something whereupon to
work and spend it's force, our life would quickely be at an end. But as the
ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing recourse to this necessitie, is sweet to the sence of our Tast; it
alledgeth, that this maintenance is the medicine of hunger, and that to the
Sicke we are not to giue physicke by ounces, who hath a good stomacke, and is
continually hungry: and for that what we eat must necessarily passe through the
Tast, our delight presseth it selfe forward, importuning for the Tasts sake,
that something more be done, than that which is due to necessitie: and because
necessitie will be satisfied with a little, and much will not suffice our Tast,
<hi>Factus sum quaestio.</hi> The like plea passeth with the eyes; I place them
vpon colours, vpon the beautie of Floures and Roses, vpon the curious Pieces of
the famousest Painters, and vpon those more liuely Pictures which God hath
painted; presently there growes in me a contention, betwixt Curiositie and
Temperance: for Curiositie doth so flatter &amp; sooth vp the eyes, that it
makes them oft-times to slip awrie, <hi>Periculosa, &amp; illecebrosa
dulcedine</hi>; This befalling me many times before euer I doe so much as once
dreame or thinke vpon it; hapning as it were vnawares, which is one of the
greatest miseries, and the most to be pittied either in myne owne, or any other
mans life: For I know not how farre my passions may trespasse vpon me, they
hauing taken possession of my heart, and liuing (like Inne-mates) within the
doores of myne owne house. Nay rather euen then when I thinke my selfe to be
freest from them, and most secure, as if they had roused themselues from some
heauie sleepe, they rise vp with greater force, and eagerly set vpon me, so
that I am at perpetual question, and at continuall oddes with my selfe from top
to toe, from the crowne of my head to the sole of my foot. And therefore in so
dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous a doubting, it is fit (ô Lord) that thy Light should bee a
guide vnto my feet, that I may know what, and how much I ought to minister to
my necessities, and to my sences. <hi>Plutarch</hi> reporteth of the Whale,
That hee hath a verie little Fish that serues as his Gentleman-Vsher, and as a
guide to lead him through the perills and dangers of the Deepe; and he sheweth
himselfe so thankefull, that when this little Fish enters with others into his
maw, hee acknowledgeth his kindnesse, and becomes his Guard or Sentinell
whilest he sleepes. The Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man sends the Sluggard to learn of the Pissemire;
so may we send the blind man to learne of the Whale: for, farre greater are the

               <hi>But shall haue the light of life.</hi> The fauourable

sets downe for a symbole of Life, a Sunne with a Starre in the midst of it,
which ariseth from out the sayd Sunne. <hi>Ezechias</hi> made choice of the
Sunne for a pledge and token of his life: and as the benigne aspect of the
Sunne doth fauour and further our life, so the rigorous aspect thereof doth
threaten death and destruction. <hi>Cyrus</hi> did dreame, That he had the

               <hi>If thou bearest Record of thy selfe, thy Record is

testimonies of our Sauiour Christ, as the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arkes, Prophets, Prophesies,
Sybils, Kings, Sheepheards, <hi>Simeon, Anna</hi> the Prophetesse, and lastly
<hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> whom they held to be some Diuine power sent downe from
Heauen; that our Sauiour asking them, Whether the Baptisme of <hi>Iohn</hi>
were from Men, or from God? They durst not denie that it was from God, least
the People should stone them. And adding to these testimonies, the workes that
himselfe wrought, <hi>If yee will not beleeue me, yet beleeue my workes; for if
I had not done those things which no man else hath done, they had not sinned,
but now they haue no excuse for their sinne.</hi> And for the testimonie of his
Doctrine, <hi>Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam sic locutus est homo, Neuer man spake as he spake</hi>:
God may speake so, but Man cannot. What shall we say to that testimonie of his
father in Iordan, <hi>This is my beloued Sonne in whom I am wel pleased?</hi>
And that of the Holy-Ghost in the forme of a Doue, which (as it is obserued by
Saint <hi>Hierome</hi>) sate vpon our Sauiours head, because none should
presume that the voyce proceeded from Saint <hi>Iohn?</hi> And that of the
Sonne of God himselfe, <hi>Though I beare Record of my selfe, yet my Record is
true?</hi> Complying with that which was spoken by the Euangelist, <hi>There
are three which beare Record in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the Father, the Word, &amp; the
Holy-ghost</hi>: any one of these Testimonies might haue giuen satisfaction to
a heart free from passion; but all of them put together, were not able to mooue
such rebellious brests and such obstinate hearts as theirs were. Great was the
hardnesse of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> heart, since after so many strange prodigies, he
sayd, <hi>I know not the Lord. Moses</hi> did not see our Sauiour Christ, nor
had any more witnesses than his Rod: neither were his wonders so great as those
myracles which our Sauiour wrought: so that the Pharisees being more hard than

               <hi>If I beare Record of my selfe, yet my Record is true,
for I know whence I came, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I goe, but you cannot tell, &amp;c.</hi>
The circumstances of my Testimonie admit no exception, and those that are
required, are commonly three, <hi>Natura, Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio, Via.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nature, Whether it be a man or a woman.</p>

an old man or a young, a Clergie man or a Lay man.</p>
            <p>The Way, whether it be of Vertue or of Vice. Our Sauiour Christ
doth not alledge any one of these circumstances, but onely tells them, <hi>My
testimonie is true, for I know whence I come, and whether I goe.</hi> Which was
as much in plaine language, as to tell them that he was God, <hi>I am God, and
the Sonne of God, in whom there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the least signe or shew of a
lie</hi>; and his proofe is, <hi>I know whence I come, and 
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:22083:277"/> whither I goe.</hi> Man is not able to know from whence
he came, nor whether he is to goe; for this is a priuiledge proper onely vnto
God. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prets this of our Sauiour Christ, <hi>The
Sunne knowes his setting</hi>; for the materiall Sunne knowes it not; and none
amongst men doe know their setting and their end. Your Astrologers do erect
Figures, prognosticating other mens successes, and casting their natiuities,
but neither truly know their owne, nor other mens fortunes; for it is a thing
reserued onely for God: <hi>The Wind bloweth where it li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth, and thou
knowest not whence it commeth, nor whither it goeth.</hi> No man can at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
vnto the inspirations of the Holy-Ghost, nor to the designes of his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Of all those secret sinnes whatsoeuer, which man committeth alone by himselfe,
as Sorcerie, Periurie, Murder, &amp; the like, no one man in all the world can
giue testimonie thereof, but God can, for he is present at all; <hi>Thou
knowest my lying downe, and my rising vp, thou seest my wayes, and
vnderstandest my paths afa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Eagle through the aire, of a Snake through the Rocke, and of a young man in the
floure of his youth; but from Gods eye nothing can be hid.</p>
            <p>The knowing of this truth will draw on the confessing of another;
to wit, That of the things appertaining to God, none can giue testimonie but
God. <hi>No man euer saw God,</hi> so saith Saint <hi>Iohn</hi>; Who then shall
giue vs testimonie of God? <hi>The onely begotten Sonne, which was in the
bosome of his Father, he shall doe it</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Of the Father, the Sonne shall
giue Record; and of the Sonne, the Father; &amp; of both, the Holy-Ghost: In a
word, euerie one of these Diuine Persons, of himselfe; but Man cannot doe it
but by reuelation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thy Record is not true.</hi> Yes, it is; for I am the Light of
the World, and of the Light none can giue Record but the Light. If any man
should say vnto the Sunne, Prooue it vnto me that thou art the Sunne, it were a
meere follie, if not madnesse, for his beames doe prooue it and proclaime it to
the World: In like manner, that the Pharisees should say vnto our Sauiour
Christ, Prooue vnto vs, that thou art the Light, was a meere blindnesse in
them; for, <hi>No Man could doe that which he did, vnlesse God had beene with
him.</hi> Vpon a Glasse the Sunne is vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally so translated, that it were a
foolishnesse to aske a testimonie, Whether it bee the Sunne or no? And vpon the
humanitie of our Sauiour Christ, the beames of his Diuinitie were in that sort
transferred, that it was hardnesse of heart, and obstinate wilfulnesse, to
desire further testimonie from God. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>He that drew
light out of darkenesse, he did inlighten our soules, that they might see the
beames of the light of God, in the face of his Sonne Iesus Christ.</hi> And for
this the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall light was sufficient: but in the Pharisees this was so
blinded through the dust of their sinnes, that they could not see this Sunne.
The Seale that is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed in Wax, shewes it selfe as cleere as if it were
grauen in Brasse or Steele; but with time or with dust it comes to be blotted
out, in that manner, that the stampe and letters are not knowne. So doth it
succeed with a Sinner, with this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall light, when it is once darkned
through sinne; whence it commeth to passe that he falleth into those foule and
grosse ignorances which the brute beasts would not fall into.</p>

that which is not, but by that which seemeth so to be; but I iudge according to
the heart, I search and trie the verie reynes. Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> called
the Sunne, <hi>Oculum Mundi,</hi> The Worlds eye; not onely because it affoords
vs that light whereby our eyes haue power to see, <pb n="524" facs="tcp:22083:278"/> but
because it sees all things: and in case that it being in the other Hemispheare,
it doth not see that which passeth in this; yet Gods eyes see all that is both
in this, and in that other world. <hi>Orpheus</hi> called the Sunne, <hi>Oculum
Iustitiae,</hi> The eye of Iustice; whose office it is, to discouer whatsoeuer
is darke and secret. Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie painted him sitting in a Ship, gouerning the
same as a Pilot; for beholding the Starres and the Mariners Compasse, he doth
not onely discerne the dangers that are aboue the water, but those hidden
Deepes which are vnder the waters. But neither the Sunne of Heauen, nor those
Sunnes of the earth can reach into the withdrawing roomes of mans bosome; onely
the eyes of Christ can looke into them, which are farre brighter than the
Sunne, <hi>His eyes are brighter than the Sunne,</hi>

saith <hi>Ieremie</hi> and Saint <hi>Iohn.</hi> The beames of the Sunne
discouer the atomes and motes in the ayre, but not the thoughts and secrets of
the heart. But the beames of the Sun of righteousnesse, discouer our smallest
thoughts. <hi>It was the foole that said in his heart, There is no God.</hi>
And though this saying came not out of his mouth, yet hee found it published in
the market place; because God diueth into the heart. The Spouse compares him to
that Goate, which the Greekes call <hi>Dorcas,</hi> for it's quicknes of sight,
as Saint <hi>Gregory Nyssene</hi> hath noted it: If a man hide himselfe in
darkenesse, shal not I see him? The Kings of the Gentiles, pretending to haue
the world to take them for gods, they gaue them to vnderstand, that they did
know the thoughts of men. To this alludeth that, which <hi>Ioseph</hi> said to
his brethren, <hi>An ignoratis, quod non similis in augurandi scientia?
Cicero</hi> saith, That among the Persians, no man could be King, who was not
skilled in the Art of Diuination. And for this cause, innumerable Witcheries,
and Sorceries were multiplyed and increased amongst them. But it is a foolerie
to imagine, That any man can enter into them but God. To which God be ascribed
all honour, power, and glory, now and for euermore. Amen.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The second inconuenience that would follow thereupon would bee
this, That our Sauiour Christ could not be a competent Iudge, had he beene a
sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as he was not. He that iudgeth another, himselfe being faulty,
condemneth himselfe. And for this reason, a Iudge that is notoriously knowne to
be a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and naughty man, may iustly be refused. <hi>Iudas</hi>
acknowledging himselfe to be a delinquent in the Incest of his daughter in law,
<hi>Tamar</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was so farre from proceeding in iudgement against her,
that he said, <hi>Iustior me est,</hi>

               <hi>She is more righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous than I.</hi> When <hi>Ioab</hi> aduised
<hi>Dauid</hi> of the siege of <hi>Rabbah,</hi> and what a number of men he had
lost in that seruice, the King might haue iustly cut off his head for his rash
and vnaduised approach to the wall; But <hi>Dauid</hi> durst not condemne him,
and put him to death, because he was an Accessorie, or rather the principall in
the busines: and therefore <hi>Ioab</hi> charged the messenger that carried the
newes, saying, If the Kings anger arise, so that he say vnto you, Why went you
nigh the wall, &amp;c. (the storie is worth your reading) then say thou, Thy
seruant <hi>Vriah</hi> the Hittite is also dead. This point did that kingly
Prophet touch vpon in those words so diuersly commented on, <hi>Tibi soli
peccaui.</hi> O Lord my sinne was against <hi>Vrias,</hi> against those
souldiers that died for his occasion, against those which did blaspheame thy
name, and against the people, whom the robbing of another man of his wife, and
the killing of her husband, hath scandalized, and beene an occasion of great
offence vnto them. But that which doth most aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

and that I haue thus sinned against thee; For in any other person whatsoeuer in
my kingdome, the rigour of Iustice might haue restrained him from so foule a
sinne, but this did not once enter into my thought. And therefore he comes with
a <hi>Tibi soli peccaui</hi>; iumping with that saying of Saint <hi>Paul, Qui

did confesse, <hi>If we say we haue no sinne, we deceiue our selues, and the

reported of, it is the destructionoftheir Subiects. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi>
saith, That he that relyeth on his conscience, and is carelesse of his good
name, is cruell towards himselfe. <hi>We must not doe good onely in Gods sight,

(though false) doth fall heauy vpon publike persons. In the Temple, there was a
vessell of brasse, a very faire one, out of which there ran a conduit pipe of
water, and was without adorned with those Looking glasses, which women that
repented them of their sinnes, had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered,<note place="margin">Looking-glasses

consecrated themselues to God, to the end that the Priests which did enter to
offer sacrifice, should wash themselues in that water and behold themselues in
those glasses; and it was Gods intent and purpose (according to
<hi>Philon</hi>) That they should place no lesse care in the cleane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of
their life, for to offer sacrifice, than those women did, in appearing good to
the world: beholding in those glasses the least marke or spot in the face. And
in the 28 chapter of <hi>Exodus,</hi> God commanded, That when the Priest
should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or goe foorth in the Sanctuary, he should beare bells about the
border of his garment,<note place="margin">The vse of Bel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

end that the noyse and sound thereof, might make his going in, and his comming

of the Priests, are their good workes: <hi>Sacerdotes tui, induantur iustitiam,
Let thy Priests be <pb n="527" facs="tcp:22083:279"/> cloathed with Righteousnesse</hi>:
And these are to sound aloud, being not holy onely in their tongue, but also in
their actions. There must be a bell, and there must be a clapper, preaching and
doing must goe together; one will not doe well with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the other. Our Sauiour
Christ aduiseth vs, That we should hide our works, and not make them knowne,
<hi>Let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doth</hi>: Least the wind of

  39.3.</note> But in a Prince and a Prelat, God would haue their workes to be
more publike, that they should not onely be holy, but also seeme so, for the
good example of the people. God placed <hi>Ioseph</hi> in the gouernment of
Egypt, because his life was so notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously good, that his master saw that the
Lord was with him, and that the Lord made all that he did to prosper in his
hand. It is a thing worthy the considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, That a Slaue in the house of an
Infidell, should professe so much vertue, so much truth, so much faithfulnesse,
so much courtesie, and so much modestie, that he should make him ruler of his
house, and put all that he had in his hand. Oh how well beseeming are these and
the like good things, for the gouernment of a kingdome.</p>
            <p>In regard of his death; and that likewise for many good and great
reasons.</p>
            <p>First, it was fitting,<note place="margin">Our Sauiours innocencie
  ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplified by his death.</note> That the testimonie of our Sauiours
innocencie should precede, to the end that it might appeare to the world, that
the Diuell by this his death was robbed and spoiled of his Empire, through his
righteousnes. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> deliuereth three things vpon this
point.</p>
            <p>The one, That God did iustly deliuer man ouer to the Empire of the
diuell; for that he suffered himselfe to be ouercome by his subtletie and
cunning.</p>
            <p>The other, That so great is the signiorie and dominion, that the
diuell hath ouer him, that he neither can with all the strength that he hath,
ouercome his temptations, nor auoid death, which he incurred through sinne. Not
that the diuell had any more right or power ouer him, than a hangman hath for
the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting of a delinquent, who receiues his command from the Iudge.</p>
            <p>The third and last, which is likewise of <hi>Leo,</hi> and Saint
<hi>Gregory</hi> the Pope, That God might very well free man from the slauery
and bondage of the diuell by his vertue and power, without doing the diuell any
wrong. Euen as a Iudge who hath deliuered ouer an offender to the hangman to
torment him, may change his mind and set him free; yet notwithstanding was
willing to treat this busines by way of Iustice, as if the diuell had proper
right thereunto.</p>
            <p>First, for that it had beene but small glorie to Gods greatnes,
that the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor should <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>est with his creature, and an infinite
power with a limited.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That he might not make his iustice suspected.<note place="margin">Christs
  equal proceeding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, a patterne for all Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates.</note>
For he that hath the least Iustice on his side, doth now and then flye to his
force and power. <hi>The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell was to be ouercome</hi> (saith Saint
<hi>Augustine,</hi>) <hi>by iustice, and not by might. Miro aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis iure
certatum est</hi> (said <hi>Leo</hi> the Pope.) Whence the Princes of the earth
may learne this lesson, That sithence the Prince of heauen proceeded so fairely
and so iustly with so base and bad a creature, hauing no tye or obligation
thereunto; let not any Prince of the earth presume to say, <hi>Sic volo, sic
iubeo, sit pro ratione voluntas</hi>; But rather hearken to that of <hi>Iob, If
I refused to be iudged with my ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Besides, it is to be noted, That the diuell did exceede his
Commission; and that God hauing giuen him power for to torment sinners, he fell
a tormenting of our Sauiour Christ, who was most innocent; he pursued him to
the death, till he had placed him vpon the Crosse. The cause was propounded in
the Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of the most blessed Trinitie, the diuell was condemned and
depriued of that <pb n="528" facs="tcp:22083:280"/> power which was giuen him. And so is
that place of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to be vnderstood, <hi>De peccato damnauit
peccatum</hi>:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ioh.</hi> 11.</note> And that of Saint
<hi>Iohn, Now is the iudgement of this world; now shall the Prince of it be
cast out.</hi> That hapned to the diuell, which bef<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ll <hi>Adam,</hi> God gaue him free
leaue and full liberty to inioy all the trees in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise, saue one onely and
no more; and he onely pitcht his palat vpon that, and tasted but of that one,
and no more. God gaue the diuell leaue to tempt all, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly interdicting him,
That he should not touch vpon our Sauiour Christ, and yet he pusht most at him.
And to the end that this fault and punishment of the diuell should remaine
notorious to the world,<note place="margin">The Crosse and death of Chri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

the testimony of his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie should goe before, and that he should say,
<hi>Quis ex vobis, &amp;c. Which of you, &amp;c. Guaricus</hi> saith, That the
death &amp; Crosse of our Sauiour Christ, was more the diuells death and crosse
than his. For our Sauiour Christ rose again the third day, but the diuell neuer
since was able to lift vp his head. And as two going forth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a challenge
into the field, are vsually both run through and slaine; so our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Christ
and the diuel were both nayled to the Crosse: Christ to his greater glory, the
diuell to his vtter destruction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If I say the truth, why doe ye not beleeue me?</hi> The truth
is the Blanke and Marke of our vnderstanding; and being that man ought
naturally to loue it, it is a meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phisicall case that he should come to
abhorre it. In satisfaction of which diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, we haue already rendered
three reasons: Whereunto we may here adde that other which our Sauiour Christ

There are some stomackes so ouerladen with euill humours, That they no sooner

turne that which is sweet into sowernes: In like sort, there are some soules so

goe so farre as doth a lye. For a lye is no sooner sowne, but it presently
growes vp, and spreads it selfe amaine. ô good God, how easily is it
beleeued, how willingly entertained! Our Sauiour Christ being risen, the High
Priests, and other the Prelates of those times, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded the souldiers, that
were set to gard the graue, that they should giue it out, that his Disciples
had stolne him away. But how my Masters (replyde the souldiers) can we doe this
without danger to our selues, or be able to answer the matter? For if the

answer that we were asleepe, and <hi>testigos dormidos</hi> (you know) <hi>no

will not be admitted for proofe, nor stand good in Law: Or that his Disciples

should set vpon souldiers; Secondly, the stone not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken away, we cannot

sow'd his seed in foure seuerall parts of the ground; and if in any one of them
hee forbare to sow, it was because he did not take it to be his. Many birds are

your wolfes, beares, bores, and other wild beasts flye from it all that they

And treating of the Gentiles, he saith, That they did glorifie the Word of God,

obseruation, That the Physition doth despaire of that Patients sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, that

&amp;c.</hi> But here he is as mild with them as a Lambe, and makes them this
soft and gentle answer, <hi>I haue not a Deuil.</hi> Which temperate behauiour
of his was grounded vpon three reasons:</p>
            <p>First of all, because he that vpon the vying of an iniurie will
not (though he haue the better cards in his hand, and that it bee in his power
to put the other to the worst) reuie vpon him, but let it passe, manifests to
the world a more noble and more glorious testimonie of his mildnesse and
patience, than he that suffereth and endureth when he cannot otherwise chuse,
wanting not so much will as power to reuenge a receiued wrong.<note place="margin">Patience when most to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded.</note> That is a generous
pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, when a man hath a smooth and easie way to worke reuenge, and yet
ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chuseth to pocket than to presse an iniurie. On the Vigiles of our
Sauiours beeing apprehended, our Sauiour Christ sayd vnto his Apostles,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luc.</hi> 22.</note> 
               <hi>Hee that hath none, let him sell his
coat and by a sword.</hi> Whereupon sayth Saint <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose,</hi> Sweet Iesus,
Why Swords, beeing thou wilt not giue thy Apostles leaue to draw them? and wert
angrie with <hi>Peter,</hi> and didst reprooue him for drawing his sword in thy
defence? Whereunto this glorious Doctour maketh vs this answere, That their
patience might appeare more noble, by hauing Swords by their sides, and yet not
offering to draw them. Let a Christian therefore weare a Sword, but let him not
vnsheath his sword, to the end that all men may see, that if he doe not reuenge
an iniurie, it is not for want of a wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon to right himselfe, but out of a
superaboundance of sufferance and patience. <hi>Isiodorus Pelusiota</hi>
disputing the reason why Christ cursed the Fig-tree, leauing it fruitlesse for
euer, <hi>Neuer man eat fruit of thee hereafter while the world standeth,</hi>
saith,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Marc.</hi> 11.1.</note> That the Iewes considering
those innumerable myracles which our Sauiour wrought, and more particularly for
the good and benefit of that people, might happely presume, That Christ had
power to doe good, but not to doe hurt: and therefore that it might appeare
vnto them, that hee had power of and ouer all, howbeit he did not in many of
them punish their wickednesse and ingratitude, yet did he punish it in the
Fig-tree, which was their true type and figure.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Christ would teach vs this lesson,<note place="margin">To
  suffer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuries a great noblenesse.</note> That the best meanes to breake
anger in an enemie, and to assuage his choller, are either soft words, or
silence. Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> saith, That to giue a faire and gentle
answere to an angrie man, is more than to prophesie of that which is to come;

the cheeke, as of the preparation of our mind</hi>; for that were but to put a
sword into a mad mans hand. And in another place he saith, That it is an
hyperbolicall kind of speech, for that Christ did pretend, That hee that is
offended should be so farre from reuenging a receiued iniurie, that hee should
rather willingly receiue a new, than reuenge an old wrong: And therfore if our
Sauiour Christ returned this answer to that rude and rough-handed Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier,

expresse to the High Priest by this his crueltie, should not thereby be
authorised, or because it might not be presumed, that Christ had lost the
respect due to the Priest; or because that no man should suspect, that there
remained any rancor in his brest, or desire of reuenge, (which they that heard
him say, That the Sonne of Man should come with power and Maiestie, and that he
had another Kingdome, where legions of Angels should shew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues for to

            <p>Thirdly, he read a Lecture vnto Princes and Prelates, of that
mildnesse and gentlenesse; which they ought to professe towards their Subiects.
Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> saith, That if Christ did condemne <hi>Peter</hi> for
drawing his sword, when they came to lay hands on his Master, and for cutting
off of <hi>Malchus</hi> his eare, it was, That Choller did not well become him,
who was afterwards to be a Gouernor of the Church, where he should meete with

            <p>Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> Saint <hi>Gregorie,</hi> and Saint

So shall they quench my sparkle that is left, and shall not leaue to mine

famous Martyr which did not tread in his martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in this path; nor any
Tyrant which did not take this course with them. And perhaps they followed
herein the steps of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> who, (as the glorious Doctor Saint
<hi>Chrysostome</hi> hath obserued) for those who would not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore his Statue,
had a hot fierie furnace, whose flames ascended forty nine cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits in heigth;

was alwayes ill intreated by the world. In the desart, the diuell once offered
him stones; The Pharisees many times. When he was borne in Bethlem, he had not
wherewithall to defend him from the cold, but was forced to be laid in the
cratch among the beasts. Whilest he liued here in the world, he had not any to
relieue his hunger. The day that hee entred in Triumph into Ierusalem, he went
forth into the field to seeke after figs. Dying, he had not any one that would
giue him so much as a iarre of water, when he cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out <hi>Sitio,</hi> I
thirst, they gaue him vinegre and gall to drinke. Pope <hi>Leo</hi> saith of
him, <hi>The dayes that were appointed for him, he began them in persecution,
and ended them in persecution.</hi> In his infancie, he began with the Crosse,

vnder my command.</hi> In some Parables, the holy Euangelists put the word,
<hi>Peregrè profectus est, He is gone afarre off.</hi> For albeit God be
alwayes present, yet it is his exceeding great mercy now and then not to bee
present. For there is no compatibilitie with his diuine presence, and our

this, he goes a little further and addeth, <hi>Tanquam Christo.</hi> For, as
Christ will not command you any thing that is against the good of your soules;
so neither is a master otherwise to command his seruant. And if he should

               <hi>that I haue made the Children of Israel to
dwel in Booths when I brought them out of the land of Aegypt</hi>; God
pretending therein, That when the children of Israell should see themselues
seated in so populous a citie as Ierusalem, strengthned with such strong walls,
and such proud and state<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Towers, that they did strike a feare and terrour
into Damascus, and all the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then round about them; fortified with so many
seuerall sorts of Armes, illustrated with the Temple, which was one of the
myracles of the world; the memory of their forepassed miserie might melt the
vaine-glorie of their present prosperitie. For the forgetting of our first
rising, causeth commonly pride and arrogancie: your wiser sort of men, when
they see themselues raised to the highest round of Fortunes wheele, they
alwayes set before their eyes their base beginning. Amongst those other
Vessells of gold and siluer on his Court-Cupboord, the Emperour intermixed some
of earth, in memoriall that he was raised from bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Potter, to the honour
of being an Emperour. <hi>Amos</hi> did neuer forget that he had bin a

are neuer vnmindful of the miserable estate of their sinnes; <hi>Quorum primus

to be puffed with the state of a new fortune, and to forget his former base and
meane estate, is a thing proper to base, ingratefull, and foolish persons: and

ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a description of the Iust, he saith, <hi>A great signe or wonder
appeared in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</hi> And that this conceit may extend it selfe a little
further, there are two things to be supposed.</p>
            <p>The one, That God painting forth by <hi>Esay</hi> the greatnesse
of the world, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares it to a drop of water, <hi>Quasi stilla situlae, As the
drop of a Bucket:</hi> Who hath measured the waters in his fist, and counted
Heauen with the spanne, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended the dust of the earth in a measure,
and weighed the mountaines in a weight, and the hills in a ballance: <hi>All
Nations before him are as nothing</hi>; all the world and it's greatnes is as a
drop of water, it is a dust, and counted by him lesse than nothing. But of the
Iust we may say, <hi>Signum magnum apparuit in Coelo, It is a great myracle in
Heauen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other, That beholding from Heauen the bredth of the earth, it
seemeth but a poore Cottage; the least of the Starres is greater than the
earth, and being beheld from thence, it seemeth to be the palme of a mans hand;
and the Sunne, which is a hundred and seuentie times bigger, seemeth in
comparison about the bignesse of a Buckler. And that a man should be iust, it
is <hi>Grande mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculum</hi>; and that he should thirst after Heauen, it is
<hi>Signum magnum</hi>; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is here said, <hi>If any man thirst,
&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>If any man thirst.</hi> He inuiteth him that is thirstie, to
desire it:</p>
            <p>First, Because Heauen is to be gained, <hi>Labore &amp; sudore, By
labour and by sweat</hi>;<note place="margin">Heauen not gotten with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
  paines.</note> and for this cause it is called in Scripture, a Crowne, a
Reward, a dayes Wages: now for to clamber ouer so many walls, <hi>We had need
be verie thirstie,</hi> and haue a good desire vnto it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Because such pretious water is not fitting to be giuen
vnto him that hath no great mind vnto it. If in those lesser things here on
earth, he that giues makes such reckning of the esteem that the pretender holds
of that he sueth for; What shall it bee in that good, which beeing enioyed, the
soule is not able to comprehend it? for, in the matter of giuing and receiuing,
so necessarie is the <pb n="544" facs="tcp:22083:290"/>

               <hi>gusto</hi>
and contentment that a man takes therein, that he that giues with disgust<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
giues not, and he that receiues with disgust, receiueth not what is giuen: And
therefore <hi>Seneca</hi> in his booke <hi>De Beneficijs,</hi> setteth downe
the <hi>decorum</hi> that is to be held therein. <hi>Ecclesiasticus</hi> saith,
<hi>There is a gift which is not profitable, and there is a gift whose
retribution is manifold.</hi> In receiuing, this reason carrieth the more force
with it; for who is he that will giue to him that hath no desire to receiue?
And with God it is more forcible; for he will haue all his gifts to bee our
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and therefore he calls those, our gifts, which in all strictnesse are
his. <hi>The Lord respected</hi> Abel <hi>&amp; his gifts.</hi> The Lambs that
were offered were Gods, <hi>Al the best of the Woods are myne, &amp;c.</hi> yet
out of his goodnesse he calls them <hi>Abels.</hi> All that we offer is his
(<hi>Quae de manu tua accepimus, reddimus tibi</hi>) yet he stiles it ours: so
that the loathing and distaste of receiuing, takes away the desire of giuing.
When the People of Israel began to say, <hi>Our stomacke is wearie of that
light meat,</hi> present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Gods prouidence iudged them vnworthie of that
fauour.</p>
            <p>Whence it is to be noted, That this vnwillingnesse doth not onely
rise from a little liking which man hath of Heauen, but of the great liking
that hee hath to these earthly goods. And this is a two fold fault:</p>
            <p>The one, That we should despise the fountaine of liuing Water.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">No appetite so fierce as that of a
  sinner.</note>The other, That we should thirst after the water of loathsome and
durtie puddles. Who will forgoe cleere and sweet waters for those bloudie
pooles of Aegypt? <hi>Exodus</hi> sayth, <hi>Quicquid habueris de pluuia,

said) one sorrow is, That they should despise the sweeter Waters; another, That
they should thirst after the muddie Waters of the earth? There is no
impetuousnesse of the fiercest Bull, nor of the furiousest Horse, comparable to
that of a Sinner which thirsteth after his vaine appetites and idle desires.
Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> and <hi>Theodoret</hi> both say, That in this <hi>Si
quis</hi> he neither dismisseth nor inforceth, but that hee publisheth the

should receiue.</hi> And this blessed Spirit is fitly compared to water,<note place="margin">The Holy Ghost Why compared to water.</note> in regard of it's
effects.</p>
            <p>The first effect of water is, To clense: <hi>Ezechiel, I w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ll poure vpon you cleane wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and
yee shall be cleane.</hi> But all the water in the world cannot wash a
Blacke-a-moore white; indeed there is no water that can make that which is
blacke, white; but the Holy-Ghost can doe this, it can adde a new cleannesse
and a new beautie thereunto;<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.</note>
               <hi>Thou shalt wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow</hi>; it shall not 
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:22083:291"/> onely lose that whitenesse which it had before, but
shall surpasse the snow in whitenesse. In like manner, a Sinner may be so
washed and so clensed, that hee may remaine more pure and more faire than the
Innocent. Againe, water clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, but as it washeth, so it wasteth and weareth
out that which it washeth, as it is to be seene in your Linnen: but the
Holy-Ghost reneweth the Soule, giuing new force and new strength, <hi>Thy youth
shall be renewed like the Eagles; and though our outward man be corrupted, our
inward man is reuiued yet day by day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second effect is, To fertilise and fructifie the earth: The
holy Spirit worketh this with great aduantage; <hi>My soule without thee is
barren,</hi> but by thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourable influence it bringeth forth the faire
fruits of Charitie, Ioy, Patience, Long-suffering, Goodnesse, Gentlenesse,
&amp;c. <hi>All these things worketh one and the same Spirit</hi>; and
therefore it is called <hi>Viuificator, A Quickning Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third effect is, To quench thirst: Onely the Holy-Ghost can
quench the thirst of the Soule; all other humane goods increase our thirst, as
it is proued in many places. And therefore <hi>Dauid</hi> did desire of God,
that he would quench this his thirst; <hi>My Soule thirsteth after God, the
Fountain of liuing water, and wo is me, &amp;c.</hi> He doth sigh and grone for
his God and his glorie, becau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>First, The force of Gods Word.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The little feare &amp; great securitie which he inioyeth
that preacheth, as also he that heareth, and obeyeth.</p>
            <p>Many excellent Diuines haue harpt vpon this string, and great
endeerings haue beene deliuered by Ecclesiasticall and Secular Historians.
<hi>Saul</hi> sent to take <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,</hi> the Officers found him playing vpon
his Harpe, and were so rauished with the sweetnesse of his Musicke, that they
forgat themselues and what the King had giuen them in charge: He sent others
more stout and resolute,<note place="margin">The power of Gods word.</note> and
the like hapned to them. The King beeing inraged with anger, and waxing
wondrous cholericke, went himselfe in person to apprehend him, vsing high
language, and throwing out great menaces &amp; threatnings against him; but he
was scarce come thither, when he fell a prophecying; who (according as some
will haue it) cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching hold of a Harp, began to play vpon it, and to sing;
like vnto some Serjeant, who finding him whom he goes to apprehend, dancing at
some Wedding in a Countrie Village, layeth aside his Mace, and falls a dancing
with the company. The Fables report, That <hi>Orpheus</hi> with his musicke
made the torments of Hell to cease, leauing those Tormentors in astonishment
and amasement. And great, que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionlesse, is the suspension which Musicke
causeth in our minds.</p>
            <p>Touching Eloquence, rare is that endeering of
<hi>Cicero,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The force of Eloquence.</note> whose
Oratorie a Poet called, <hi>Flexamina, &amp; omnium rerum Regina.</hi> That of
<hi>Marcus Antonius,</hi> that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Roman Orator, was so singular in this
kind, that the Senat sending a Band of souldiers to cut off his head, he did
earnestly intreat them, that they would but giue him the hearing of three or
foure words: they did so; but those his words were so powerful, that forsaking
their former fierce resolution, they shea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed vp their swords, and gaue him
his life; and which was much more, they so melted into teares, <hi>That hanging
their heads in their bosome, and casting their eyes to the ground, they all
fell a weeping. Plutarch</hi> telleth vs, how that <hi>Palemon,</hi> a
hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some young man of Athens, but of a most loose and dishonest life, came in
one <pb n="548" facs="tcp:22083:292"/> day to heare <hi>Xenocrates</hi> in that kind of
wanton fashion and habit, that any Who<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e or Curtezan could not tricke and set forth her selfe in a more
lasciuious manner: on which occasion the Phlosopher taking hold, did plead in
fauor of Honestie, with such strength of words, such excellent language, and
such extraordinarie eloquence, that in the presence of the Auditors
<hi>Palemon</hi> stript himselfe out of all his gay cloathes, pluckt the Rings
out of his eares, and off his fingers, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing from that time forward, a
verie honest man, and a good patterne to others. No lesse wonderfull was that
which befell <hi>Phyletus</hi> a Disciple of <hi>Hermogenes</hi> the Inchanter,
who came to dispute and maintaine argument with Saint <hi>Iames</hi> the
el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, relying much vpon his Sophistrie; but the Apostle preached with that
powerfulnesse, that <hi>Phyletus</hi> returning backe againe to his Master,
told him, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus abieram, Christianus reaco, I went forth a Magician, but I
am returned</hi> a <hi>Christian.</hi> To this purpose the Fables report of
<hi>Hercules,</hi> That with chaines of gold which came forth of his mouth, he
haled after him all the World. But neither the truths of humane Histories, nor
the lies of artificiall Fables, can attaine vnto the force and power of Diuine
Eloquence. <hi>Esay</hi> foretold vs as much; <hi>All Nations shall flow vnto
him</hi>; borrowing his Metaphore in this word <hi>Flow,</hi> from some great
and principall Riuer, which without any violence, runs along with that strange
force and swiftnesse, that nothing can resist it, but sweepes all away that
stands in it's way. Being one and the same comparison with that of Saint
<hi>Iohn, Out of his bellie shall flow Riuers of water of Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From hence (and that verie fitly) we may draw a second
consideration; which is this, If from euerie one that enioyeth this Spirit,
there flow forth great riuers of liuing water, well may those good men liue
without feare, and secure from all harmes, wrongs, affronts, and tyrannies.
Consider with thy selfe in a Riuer, the force of the water, the impetuousnesse
and furie of a swift Torrent, the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of a great streame, wherewith a
hundred Mills are driuen; Who will dare to keepe it backe? Who will offer to
stand in it's way? Who can resist it? Of the comming of our Sauiour Christ it
was prophecied, That hee should banish all feare and cowardise from out the
hearts and brests of his friends. <hi>Dauid</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares the iust man, to the

Moone, and as a faithfull witnesse in the Heauen. Alcyat</hi> sayth in one of

Dog; or whither it be occasioned by the <hi>macula's</hi> or spots in the
Moone, representing vnto him the forme and shape of another Dog: but though the
Dog barke neuer so much, yet doth the Moone walke her Station securely through
Heauen; and though Tyrannie barke neuer so much at the Iust, yet shall hee
walke in safetie. The Spouse in the <hi>Canticles</hi> complaineth, That
Tyrants had taken her cloake from her: The Church calleth this her Cloake, the
Martyrs; wee see some of them roasted, some fryed on the Gridyron, some sawne,

went and wrought myracles in the Cities of Galilee, because the Iews sought to

such matter to be feared, but that waiting for the houre of his death, alreadie
determined in Heauen, he was desirous in the interim to slinke out of the way,
to free and deliuer his bodie from that malice and danger which he saw it was
like to be subiect vnto in Iudaea. The Greeke Texts read, <hi>In Iudaea &amp;

               </gap>e which point were a
needlesse labour, there beeing so many Prophecies and so many places of the one
and the other Testament, which say as much; and those loud shrieking cries
which the Deuills roared forth, affrighted, and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning cowards in his
presence, are sufficient proofes thereof; likewise Deaths cowardlinesse
confirmes the same, <hi>Egredietur Diabolus, ante faciem eius ibit Mors</hi>;
the ouerthrowing of the Roman Cohorts with one onely word; his causing the 
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:22083:293"/> stones to freeze to their fingers that had so often
sought to stone him to death; his leauing them lying on the ground in a swoune
that came to apprehend him, are testimonies without exception. Why then at
euery step doth Christ retyre himselfe, and seeke to get from them? Saint
<hi>Augustine</hi> makes this difficulty seeme greater in his bookes <hi>de
Ciuit. Dei</hi>; For, reprehending <hi>Cato Vticensis,</hi> who that he might
not fall into <hi>Caesars</hi> hands, killed himselfe, he saith, That for a man
to flye from tribulation and danger, is a kind of Cowardize. And Saint

               <hi>I know that

saying of the Church is worthy the weighing, <hi>Qui omnipotentiam tuam

dye than he did, as hath already been proooued vnto you. If then (sweet Iesus)
thou doest so much desire death, and that the Iewes hunt after thee for no
other end, Why doest thou flye?</p>
            <p>Before that I resolue this doubt, we are to confesse and
acknowledge with all possible humilitie, that mans vnderstanding comes farre
short of Gods thoughts. <hi>Esay</hi> saith, see how much distance there is
betweene heauen and earth; so much is there betweene the imaginations of God
and man: And therefore the Spouse said,<note place="margin">Gods Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sells
  vnsearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</note> That they were high and black; high like the Palme tree,
and blacke as the Rauens quill. Who (saith <hi>Ecclesiasticus</hi>) can count
the sands of the sea, the drops of the deaw, or the dayes of the world? Now if
humane wisedome cannot at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnto those things, which she hath as it were
betweene her hands, she will lesse be able to search into the secret counsells
of God. And therefore the Wise man doth aduise thee, <hi>Seeke not into those
things that are too high for thee.</hi> This way being thus made, let vs now
proceed to the reasons of the Saints.</p>
            <p>The first is of Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> and Saint
<hi>Chrysostome.</hi> Our Sauiour Christ was God, according to his Diuine
nature; and man, according to his humane nature: and the confession of the one,
being as necessary as the other, he had in all his actions a great respect vnto
them both. <hi>All his words and deeds still tended to this, that he might be
beleeued to be both God and man.</hi> Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, That his
with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing himselfe aside as a man, did not withdraw from his power as hee
was God; and his throwing downe of his enemie flat on the ground, as he was
God, did not take from him his weaknesse, as he was man. If Christ should not
haue showen in the flesh, the condition of flesh, in vaine had he taken flesh
vpon him: and if he should alwayes haue done the workes and actions of a God,
and giuen perpetuall pledges of his Diuine nature, to what vse would haue
serued his cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing himselfe with humane flesh? If Christ should haue beene a
continuall <pb n="551" facs="tcp:22083:293"/> Miracle, what roome would there haue been
left for faith, or what reward could that haue receiued?</p>
            <p>The second is of <hi>Chrysologus,</hi> which is this: That there
is not that man be he neuer so powerfull, neuer so valiant, but doth sometimes
shew the weaknes of a man, in hiding and withdrawing himselfe. But here he
saith, <hi>Artis est, non timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, Sacramenti est, &amp; non Pauoris.</hi> It
was not out of any feare, or cowardize that our Sauiour fled. It is a kind of
daringnesse, boldnesse of spirit, and great cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to draw our enemie but
into the field, or to toll him along into the market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place, and there to
vanquish him in publike, and obtaine an open victorie.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.</note> 
               <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius</hi> saith, That Christ
vsed this boldnesse in the garden, as well in his swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of blood, as in
those his prayers that he made vnto his Father, so full of agonie and anguish,
to the end that by shewing himselfe thus weake, death might the more boldly set
vpon him. <hi>Ioshua</hi> vsed the like slight with those of the City of Ay;
<hi>We flying, they will follow vs, then ye shall rise vp from lying in wait,
and destroy the City. Agesilaus,</hi> one of the Lacedemonian Captaines,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iosh</hi> 8.</note> tooke the same course when he besieged the
Phocenses; <hi>Alcybiades,</hi> with the Vizancini:<note place="margin">Aduantage
  a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, no Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardize.</note> And the world neuer had any famous
Captaine which did not doe the like vpon occasion: <hi>Iulius Frontinus</hi> in
his booke of Stratagemes quotes you a world of examples. <hi>Be ye wise as
Serpents,</hi> said our Sauiour; the Serpent aduantageth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe more by his
craft and subtletie, than by his strength and force; the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence whereof
was to our griefe to be seene in Paradise. And therefore it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued by
Gods Saints, That he was more subtill than all the rest of the beasts of the
field, therein aduising vs, That with the diuell, the world, and the flesh, it
is now and then the wiser and safer course of the two, to retyre our selues and
to flye from him, than either to wait for him, or to resist him.
<hi>Philip</hi> king of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon turned his backe and fled before the
Athenians, leauing his Shield behind him, wherein these letters were ingrauen,
<hi>Bona fortuna</hi>: And some souldiers vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braiding him with this his flight,
he told them, He that flyes, may returne againe to the battell, but not he that

spot his honour, did at last most gloriously loose his life, did sometimes giue
ground and make a retreat from his enemies. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> escaped being
let downe in a basket by the wals of Damascus: And Saint <hi>Augustine</hi>
saith, That it had beene a tempting of God, and so a sinne in him, if he had
not done it. Yet afterwards, being prisoner in Macedonia, and that all the rest
of the prisoners saued themselues by flight, he would not then flye, though hee
were thereunto intreated by the Gaoler. <hi>Dauid</hi> was of that true mettall
and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,<note place="margin">In some cases it is fortitude to flye.</note>
that he fought with Lyons and Beares, making no more reckoning of them than of
so many lambes; and without once breaking of his Speare, he slew 800
Philistims, besides that stout Gyant which outbraued Israel, and strooke a
terrour into them. And yet did it not seeme cowardize in him to flye from
<hi>Saul,</hi> nor from his sonne <hi>Absalon.</hi> Vpon this occasion he made
that his 18 Psalme, wherein he giues thankes vnto God, not onely for giuing him
armes of brasse for to fight, and euen to breake a bowe of Steele asunder, but
that he had giuen him likewise the feet of a Hart to flye. Wherein hee alluded
(according to <hi>Thomas</hi>) to that Historie which he recounteth in the
second of the Kings,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Reg.</hi> 4.</note> when he fled
from <hi>Saul</hi> through briars and bushes, rocks and mountaines. In a word,
the world stiles rashnesse, daringnesse; and feare, cowardlinesse: but God
bewai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth this with a <hi>Woe be vnto ye that call good euill, and euill
good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third reason is, That Christ withdrew himselfe out of Iudea to
giue way to his enemies rage and anger. For a cholericke man is so furious,
that if hee haue a present occasion offered him, that there is not any poulder
will sooner take fire than he; and therfore it is Christian wisedome to flye
from him. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture compares him to a beare, <hi>Like a Beare robbed of
her Whelps</hi>: of whom your Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalists report, That for very rage shee will
eate and deuoure her owne pawes.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iob</hi> 40.</note> And
<hi>Iob, Tygris perijt, eo quod non habuit praedam.</hi> And another letter
hath it, <hi>Vrsus perijt, eo quod non est consequutus praedam. Saul</hi> being
inraged that hee had not ouercome his enemies, slew himselfe. Such a one is
like a swelling riuer that ouerflowes it's bankes. It is a hot fierie furnace,
whence issueth out a thicke smoake, and after the smoake a flame.
<hi>Ecclesiasticus</hi> saith, As the vapour and smoake of the chimney goeth
before the fire,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Eccles.</hi> 22.</note> so euill words,
rebukes and threatnings, goe before blood-shedding. The smoake is not that
which burnes, though it blinds and causeth the eyes to water; but who will
abide the flame thereof? Who will tarry the comming of a Beare that hunteth
after her prey? Who the falling of a swift Torrent? The soundest counsell is,
to flye. And in the dangers of the soule, this doctrine importeth vs much more.
As the Hart that is wounded with an arrow that is poysoned, flyes to the riuers
of water, so the heart that is touched with the venome of the Diuell, of the
world, or the flesh, must flye vnto that fountaine, which is God, <hi>My soule
thirsteth after God, who is the fountaine of life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fourth, That though he were able to haue trod downe all his
enemies vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his feet,<note place="margin">Why Christ desiring to die would

               </gap> For a man will not alwayes shew all
that he knowes; nor doe all that he can. Your foolish Princes make ostentation
of their power; but wise Princes, of their Iustice. The one make their power,
their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; the other make their reason, their power, <hi>Sit pro ratione

               <note place="margin">Power
  should neuer bee showne but in extremity.</note> but because he was a Tyrant,
he forgot his iustice. But our Sauiour Christ he forgot his power, and reades
vnto vs a Lecture of Prudence; Teaching vs, that we must reserue our power, and
our wisedome, for some good occasion.</p>

               <pb n="553" facs="tcp:22083:295"/>The fifth and last, That albeit our Sauiour
Christ felt the anguish and agonies of death, yet were they nothing like vnto
those his enemies felt for to worke his death. For his death was not to be at
their appointment, nor how and when they would haue it. The Pharisees sought to
make him away secretly in a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but he would dye in the face and sight of
all the world,<note place="margin">The greater Chris<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

greater his shame was, the greater was our redemption. The Pharisees would not
haue it on a festiuall day; Our Sauiour Christ, that it should be vpon a
festiuall day: for it was to be the greatest feast that was euer made for man.
The Pharisees would haue had him rid out of the way presently; Christ that it
should not be till his houre was come, and that he had finished all things that
his Father had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen him in charge. And for this cause, when they sought after
him, hee fled from them; and when they did not seeke after him, he came
himselfe into the Shambles. <hi>Elias</hi> fled from <hi>Iezabel,</hi> that he
might not dye by her hand, and yet afterwards sitting vnder the Iuniper tree,
he desired death. The Iuniper tree was a Type and figure of the Crosse, for

from Iudaea. So that it seemeth to this sacred Doctour, That Christs kinsmen
were doubtfull of the truth of his workes. Whence it followeth, That those whom
the Euangelist here calleth Christs bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, were not of the Twelue: because
he sayth of them, His brethren beleeued not in him. But others, We know and
beleeue that thou art the Sonne of God. But that place of Saint
<hi>Matthew</hi> doth prooue it more plainely, where when Christ preached, one
came vnto him and told him, Thy mother and thy bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren stay without to speake
with thee: But hee stretching out his hand to his Disciples, said, These are my
mother and my brethren. In the first chapter of the <hi>Acts,</hi> naming the
Apostles, and amongst them. <hi>Iacobus Alphei, Simon,</hi> and
<hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi> he presently sayes, These did perseuere in prayer with the
women, with the mother of our Lord, and with his brethren. Now his brethren
were not of the number of the Apostles. And of this opinion is Saint
<hi>Augustine,</hi> and Saint <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, That the end of this their
counsell, was Ambition; and that it seeming vnto them, that they should haue
some share thereby in Christs glory, said vnto him, <hi>Transi hinc.</hi> And
to him that shall obiect that of S. <hi>Iohn, His brethren beleeued not in
him</hi>; I answer thereunto, That they did not beleeue that he was the
promised Messias: But withall, That they did not doubt of the truth of his
workes; but did onely desire to see them qualified and approued by the Scribes
and Pharisees, who were well skild in all the prophesies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My time is not yet come.</hi> Two things make this opinion of
Saint <hi>Augustines</hi> very probable.<note place="margin">Men couet honor,

And albeit it is very likely that they did know, that in Iudaea they would
seeke to take away his life from him, yet the thirst of their ambition was so
great, that they affected ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, though it were to bee effected at the cost
of their kinsmans life; as the sonnes of <hi>Zebedee</hi> did their seates. And
he might as well haue sayd vnto them, <hi>Ye know not what ye aske</hi>:<note place="margin">God vseth no partialitie in the dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his
  fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours.</note> for it is not Gods fashion to conferre fauours for respect of
country, or kindred. The Princes of the earth oftentimes take this course,
ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a coward, a Captaine, and putting a Hare into a Lyons place: But God
doth not hold him worthy of reward, or of the least praise, who is not
priuiledged as well for it by his owne proper vertue, as by blood and alliance.
The Iewes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted it a great honour vnto them, that they were the sonnes of
<hi>Abraham,</hi> but because there was no shew of worth in themselues, our
Sauiour takes them vp very short,<note place="margin">We must not relye on others
  Vertue, but our owne.</note> telling them; <hi>Ye are of your father the
diuell</hi>: And therefore there is no honour due vnto you. And it is
<hi>Aristotles</hi> saying in his <hi>Ethnickes, Ab hu quae à na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura
insunt, nec laudamur, nec vituperamur.</hi> Many Pagan Princes did follow this
tracke. <hi>Plutarch</hi> reporteth of King <hi>Antigonus,</hi> That a young
Souldier preferring a suit vnto him, he returned him this answer: I euermore
bestow my fauours on those that deserue the same in themselues, and not in
others. <hi>Pirrhus</hi> King of the Epyrots, his sonnes vrging him to tell
them, which of them should be his heire, and succeed him in his Kingdome?
answered, He whose sword hath the shar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest edge.</p>
            <p>The other, Is our Sauiours Christ own answer, <hi>My time is not
yet come.</hi> Which (according to Saint <hi>Augustine</hi>) was, as if he
should haue said, ye would haue glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and take no paines for it. And
therefore he saith vnto them, <hi>Your time is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes readie,</hi> but with
me, my Crosse must goe before my glory, <hi>I must mount by humilitie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now from these two considerations I will draw this one profitable

               </gap>int, That when a fauour is
throwne vpon a man,<note place="margin">Honor where no merit is, ads to our
  shame, not to our shining.</note> vpon any other Title or Claime, saue his owne
proper vertue and merit, it is rather an affront than an honor. They giue thee
an office, or some dignitie, because thou hast presented them with some
foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish bable or other, or hast carryed a shooe-clout in thy pocket to wipe
such a Noble mans shooe; it is an infamous Title, both in the giuer and the
receiuer. They doe thee some fauour for kindreds sake, and because thou art of
their blood; it is a Title of little honour to him that receiues it, and of
lesse Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianitie in him that giues it. They preferre thee to be the Princes
seruant, what good does that doe thee? It is so base a Title, That no Noble
Spirit will desire it. Thou gettest thy pretension by offering thy loue and
seruice to this or that Court Lady; it is a dangerous pretension. Thou art
raised by such a Lord, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause thou hast serued him in his vnlawfull
pleasures; this is a damnable Title. God conferres his fauours vpon no other
Title than a mans owne proper vertue. Vpon <hi>Noah</hi>: But why? <hi>Because
thou wast vpright before me in thy generation.</hi> And in the day of
iudgement, who are they that shall be rewarded? and why shall they be rewarded?
<hi>Come ye blessed of my Father receiue a Kingdome, For I was hungry,
&amp;c.</hi> Vpon this Title is grounded the reward of a good death,
<hi>Blessed are they that dye in the Lord, for their workes follow them.</hi>
Not because he was an Apostle, a Prophet, a Doctor,<note place="margin">Worship
  should not wait but vpon worth.</note> a Confessor, a Prince, a Prelat, can he
pretend a reward; but because he was a good Christian and did all the duties
belonging thereunto. <hi>Their works fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them</hi> as a handmaid doth her
Mistres, or a Page his Master. If thou wilt haue honour, striue to win it. Your
Antients set two vessells before <hi>Iupiter,</hi> The one of exceeding sweet
liquor, the other exceeding sower; and no man could come to

The Romans had two Temples adioyning each to other; one of Honour, the other of
Vertue: but there was no comming to that of Honour, but by that of Vertue.</p>

any God which they so much adored, as that of Honour: and for the Author of
this truth, he alledgeth <hi>Salust, Ista ergo landis auiditas, &amp; cupido

and not onely in Rome, but in Greece. And in most of your other Nations, there
was not a Captaine or Philosopher which did not eclipse all the other vertues
that he inioyed, with the shadow of this desire of Honour. This did <hi>Seneca,
Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch, Aristotle,</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> pretend. And <hi>Socrates</hi>
himselfe, who did so much blaz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

his pouertie, and seem'd to take a pride in it, came to be an Idolater of Honor
and Fame. This pill they swallowed downe, and conceiuing a kind of immortality
to be lapt therein, cram'd their conceits therewith, making the discommodity of
life, dangers, sweats, troubles, &amp;c. seeme sauoury vnto them:<note place="margin">Honour a bait which all men bite at.</note> Which is a kind of
birdlime which clingeth so close to our hearts, that Gods greatest Saints do
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine and bewaile the great difficulty in being loosed and freed therefro.
Saint <hi>August.</hi> did intreat of God with teares and sighes, that he would
free him from this plague, <hi>Domine sine secatione tentamur, tu nosti de hac
re ad te gemitum cordis mei, &amp; flumina oculorum meorum.</hi> And if a Saint
so humbly minded, as none more, doth thus weepe, sigh and groane, what shall
become of him that is as arrogant as hee is ignorant? And in another place,
this Sacred Doctor saith, <hi>The purer thou art from this vncleannesse, the
liker shalt thou be vnto God.</hi> And in an Epistle of his, hee saith, That by
how much the Moone is more full and faire in our eyes, it partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pateth so
much the lesse of the same; which is all one with that of
<hi>Ecclesiast.</hi>

               <hi>The light
thereof diminisheth vnto the end, and groweth wondrously in her changing.</hi>
These words seeme to carry a contrarietie, but it is not so: for the Moone doth
decrease to our seeming towards the end of it's waning; and yet euen at that
very time it increaseth wonderfully, receiuing from the Sun by the contrary
part a far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter light. It seemed then to these kins folke of Iesus Christ
our Redeemer, That the Feast of Ierusalem was a fit time for to gaine much
honour, and therefore said vnto him, <hi>Depart hence, and manifest thy selfe
to the world.</hi> Whereunto hee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, ye desire to see me in great honour
and estimation with the world, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting out of my reputation and credit, to
reape vnto your selues a temporall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; but I doe rather desire to see my
selfe dis-esteemed of the world, because thereupon dependeth your spirituall
promotion.</p>

and the glorious Saint <hi>Ioseph</hi> went to seeke Iesus when he was lost

saith, That many miscarry by their kinsfolks means. And I my selfe haue known
many Prelats of very good parts, and extraordinarie gifts, of whom I haue beene
afraid, that their kinsfolke haue beene the cause of their condemnation, and
casting downe into hell. For it is a wofull case, That for 200 Ducats pension,
which a Prelat bestowes on a Student, hee should oblige him to run ouer all the
Diuine Seruice, and not to leaue out so much as any one <pb n="556" facs="tcp:22083:298"/>

            <p>Two bloody mischiefes come vnto vs by our brethren and
kindred.</p>
            <p>The one in point of precedencie, Enuie working most vpon those
that are bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; especially, if one get the start of the other, or chance to
be preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him. As the History of <hi>Iosephs</hi> brethren proueth
it vnto vs; who (for those his dreames of his future prosperity) put him down
into a pit, and sold him away. So stood the case in <hi>Abimilecks</hi>
busines, who for Superiorities sake, and that hee might raigne, slew at once 70
of his brethren. Holy king <hi>Dauid</hi> could not escape this mischiefe: His
brethren could haue eaten him (as we say) with salt, to see that he should pop
forth, and enter into the field with that mettall and courage against that
great Gyant <hi>Goliah,</hi> himselfe being the least amongst his brethren. And
was it not so I pray,<note place="margin">Enuy neuer greater than amongst
  bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</note> with <hi>Abel</hi> and <hi>Cain</hi>? For a brother of all
other can least endure that a brother should outstrip him, though it be Gods
owne handy-work to aduance and prefer him. And the sonnes of <hi>Thamar</hi>
are a type and figure there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, who stroue and strugled in their mothers
wombe.</p>
            <p>The other in regard of the desire that they haue to see a brother
or a kinsman prosper, onely that they may sucke from him, and wholly disfruit
him, as if hee were a tree of their owne orchard, which, of these two
mischiefes, is the greater.</p>
            <p>For in the first, the enuious brother looses, and the enuyed
gaines.</p>
            <p>In the second, all rob that tree which affoords them fruit, and
that brother or kinsman that is owner of it.</p>
            <p>I remember a memorable saying that was vttered by a holy Prelat,
relieuing (being importuned therunto) two of his brethren with 200 Crownes, for
to buy them Oxen to till their ground. I shall (said he) desire of God, That
this poore pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance which I now giue you, doe not consume the rest of that
which ye now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy. My brethren, to facilitate their request, told me that I
was a single man, had no body to care for,<note place="margin">Kindred will
  cleaue to a man in his prosperity, but neuer look on him in aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie.</note>
that I was a <hi>Guarda de Vinas,</hi> a Vine-keeper, a Church-man, and an
ouerseer of soules, <hi>Sed vineam mea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> non custodiui,</hi> But I did not keep
this my Vinyard so wel as I should haue done: for I could not defend it from my
brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and my kinsfolk, one plucking this from me, and another that, til they
had left me nothing to pleasure either my selfe or the poore, whom I ought most
to haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected. If thou be rich, all thy kindred will bee like so many
horse-leeches to draw thy blood from thee; but if thou be poore, not a kinsman
that will looke vpon thee. That mirrour of patience, that holy man <hi>Iob</hi>
saith in his 31 chapter, <hi>Despectio propinquorum terruit me,</hi> There was
not that kinsman that would looke vpon me in my misery, but beheld me with
disdaine and scorne, and would not affoord me any the least comfort. Vaine is
the confidence in friends and kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folks; vaine is the confidence in Princes.
And therefore ô Lord let vs relye vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee, who neuer faylest those
that put their trust in thee. To God the Father, God the Sonne, and God the
Holy Ghost, &amp;c.</p>

            <p>The third, in remembrance of that Altar which <hi>Iudas

               <note place="margin">1

And this is that Feast whereof the Gospell makes mention; it was celebrated on
the twentie fifth of Nouember, which in the Iewish account was the ninth
moneth, about the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Winter; and therefore it is sayd, <hi>It was
Winter.</hi> Now our Sauiour Christ passing along through the porch of the
Temple, the Iewes flocked about him, both Nobles and Plebeians, and sayd vnto
him, How long doost thou make vs doubt? How long wilt thou hold vs in suspence?
if thou be the Christ, tell vs so plainly without any more adoo. But Iesus gaue
them so vnsauorie an answer to this their vnmannerly demand, that they tooke vp
stones to stone him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The feast of the Dedication was at Ierusalem.</hi> It is the
language of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,<note place="margin">Mans Heart, Gods Temple.</note>
and especially of the Apostle Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> to call our Brest, Heart, or

            <p>But here we are to consider, That our heart, or the soule of a
Christian man, is a higher rooft Temple, and farre more spacious. After that
<hi>Salomon</hi> had made an end of building his Temple, he sayd, O Lord, I
haue built thee an House to dwell in, but it is too little for thy greatnesse;
for if the Heauens, and the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens of Heauens are not able to containe thee,
how much more vnable is this House that I haue built, it being but a Thimble as

to make it as cleane as it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: and therefore, ô Lord, I beseech
thee, that thou wilt create a new heart in me, wherewith I may loue thee for
euer. But if this cannot be, because the soule is immortall, perdurable, and
incorruptible, <hi>Renew a right spirit within me,</hi> that there may not
remaine any sent or sauour of my former foulnes; establish such a spirit in me,
that I may neuer fal from thy seruice; a spirit that may repaire those wrongs I
did before: and if that were an occasion that many did blaspheme thy Name, let
this be such a one, that it may conuert many vnto thee, and that they may truly
serue thee. The glorious Doctor Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> touched vpon this
string, <hi>Dauid</hi> (saith he) did desire of God, That he would create him a
new heart, not that he should create it anew, but that he should so renew it,
that it might seeme to be created anew; for to clense it, was all one as to
create it.</p>

               <hi>And it was Winter.</hi> Saint <hi>Gregorie</hi> saith, That

signifie by them,<note place="margin">Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Time and Place in Holy

mouth. And that this circumstance of <hi>Hyems erat, It was Winter,</hi> though
it may be referred to our Sauiour Christs walking from place to place, yet doth
it declare the frostinesse and ycie coldnesse of the Iews hearts. By coldnesse,
the Scripture vnderstandeth the malice of sinne; whence it is to bee noted,
That the Historie of the <hi>Machabees</hi> calleth this Solemnitie,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ierem.</hi>
  6. 2. <hi>Mac.</hi> 1.18.</note> The Feast of Fire; Whereas we are now purposed

the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles and of the Fire, which was giuen vs when <hi>Nehemias</hi>
offered Sacrifice, after that he had built the Temple and the Altar, &amp;c. It
appeareth by the sixth Chapter of <hi>Leuiticus,</hi> That God did conserue a
perpetuall fire in his presence, <hi>The Fire shall euermore burne vpon the
Altar, and neuer goe out.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Leuit.</hi> 6.13.</note>
At their departure into Babylon, they hid their fire in a deepe pit, and at
their returne they found it turned into a thick water like a gellie;
<hi>Nehemias</hi> he takes it forth and setteth it in the Sunne, and presently
it became fire: the drops that remained, they did sprinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle or bedew the Altar
therewith, and they forthwith tooke fire; so that it was fitly called the Feast
of Fire. But that they who solemnise this Feast should bee all Frost and Ice,
is a thing verie worthie our consideration.</p>
            <p>This is our ruine and perdition, That the verie same day that wee
treat of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing our soules, which is the feast of the Fire of our Spirit,
there should bee such a great coldnesse in vs, &amp;c. <hi>Take heed your

reuealed vnto his Disciples, whether it were the euils that should befall
Ierusalem, or the insuing miseries of this world, or those that should threaten
the Soule at each particular mans death, or all of them ioint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly together; and
supposing that none would be able to abide them, but that they would be forced
to flie from the euill to come; hee giues them this <hi>auiso, Take heed your
flight, &amp;c.</hi> Our Sauiour would not haue them to betake themselues to
flight, neither on the Sabboth day, nor in the Winter.</p>
            <p>Not on the Sabboth day, because their Law did not giue them leaue
to go any more than a thousand paces, a matter of a mile. But say some one
should haue ventured to breake this Law, and to haue gone further, he could not
haue ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on an Inne-keeper to bid him welcome, got no meat, no fire to
dresse it, nor <pb n="560" facs="tcp:22083:300"/> haue met with any companie on the way,
but haue trauelled all alone in a feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full kind of solitude.</p>
            <p>Not in the Winter, in regard of innumerable inconueniences, as
raine, durt, boggs, yce, frost, snow, rising of riuers, and dayes short and
darke. Saint <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie</hi> expoundeth this place of those euills which
threaten vs at our death; but be it in our death or in our life, the world hath
not any creature that is more threatned and terrified than a Sinner. Who can
looke Sinne in the face? our best course is to flie from it, and to haue
recourse to the Sanctuarie of Repentance; but we must take heed that we doe not
flie on the Sabboth, or in Winter. <hi>In die illa</hi> (saith

cause more securitie than saluation; <hi>These being a generation that are pure
in their owne conceits, and yet are not washed from their filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
Caesarius Arelatensis</hi> compareth Penitence to a Storme or Tempest, where
the winds, thunders, and lightnings play their parts: the wind at sea rents
sailes, splits Masts, crackes Cables, teareth vp Anchors, and breaketh the
Oares in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: Penitence must rent the sailes wherewith thou sailest in this
world with the wind in the poupe, it must cracke asunder the strong Cables of
thy wilfull affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, it must teare vp the Anchors of thy ill fastned hopes,
and breake those Oares of false and deceitfull Court-fauours, which thou falsly
supposest shall row thee ashore to some safe Harbour. On land, the wind turneth
vp the tallest Cedars and hugest Okes, though they haue taken neuer such deepe
rooting. There are men in the World that haue taken deeper rooting in worldly
riches, in their honours and their pleasures, than either the tall Cedar, or
the sturdie Oke; and there is nothing that can rent them vp by the roots, and
make them stoupe, but the stiffe wind of Penitence. These men must haue the
Waters of Grace to quench the flames of their couetous desires, and of the
fierie lusts of the flesh; <hi>Euerie night</hi> (saith <hi>Dauid) I will wash
my bed.</hi> The fire of Concupis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence which is kindled in this bed, must be
quenched with the watrie teares of the eys; and in stead of that fire, take
vnto thee the fire of Zeale, of Charitie, and of Loue, that may inflame the
Soule, kindle the Will, and inlighten the Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing; <hi>Ignem veni
mittere in terram, &amp;c.</hi> Thou must likewise haue the thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Gods
iudgements in thyne eares, to strike a terrour into thee of Gods Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie, to
make thee fearefull to offend, and keep thee in a continuall aw of keeping his
commandements, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And Iesus walked in the porch of Salomon.</hi> There is no
Falcon that flieth so high, giues so many wrenches to the Herne, or makes more
stoopings with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to seise on his prey; no enamoured Gallant, that halfe
so much rounds the dores of her he adoreth; no Sheepheard so trudgeth through
the Mountaines, seeking after his lost Sheepe; no poore Soule more seekes after
the house of <pb n="561" facs="tcp:22083:300"/> some rich and well deuoted Almes-giuer; nor
doth the Sunne fetch so many turnes through the world, as the Sonne of
righteousnesse doth to recouer a lost soule. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> before he
had got out of his errour, said, <hi>Circumuoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabat â longe
misericordia tua, Thy mercy did flye about afarre off.</hi> Sinne doth separate
vs from God, and remooues vs farre from him. <hi>Longè à
peccatoribus Salus, Salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is farre from the wicked.</hi> But his mercy
though it stood aloofe off, yet his eye did still watch ouer me, which is a
great argument of Gods loue towards mee. And from hence it ariseth, That there
is great feasts and ioy made in heauen for one soule that is conuerted; like
vnto those congratulations, and fellow-feelings which the Shepheard desireth
others should entertaine him withall, when hee hath found his lost sheepe.
Great is the Shepheards ioy when he findes his lost sheepe. But this is more
especially verified in God, it being his <hi>Delitiae, esse cum filijs
hominum.</hi> Then dost thou walk with great delight and contentment through
thy soules Temple, when thou doest contemplate the high mysteries thereof; Then
doest thou walke through thy vnderstanding, when thou art zealous in the loue
thereof; Then doest thou walke through thy will, when thou doest call to mind
the great blessings from Gods bountifull hand, with a desire to be thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and seruiceable vnto him; Then doest thou walke through thy memorie, when thou
doest occupie thy selfe in holy thinges; Then doest thou walke through thy
eyes, when thou doest exercise thy selfe in workes of pittie; Then doest thou
walke through thy hands, when thou doest make a bed for the poore, and bind vp
the wounds of the wounded; Then doest thou walke through thy tongue, when thou
giuest wholesome counsell to thy brother. In a word, then doth thy soule take
her ease &amp; rest, sitting as it were on a Throne, and on a liuing Altar,
farre better than that which is made of stone; for one single sigh offered vp
vpon this Altar, is able to preuaile more than many on any other Altar.</p>

and speake vnto Pharaoh, that he let my people goe; But I know that hee will
not let them goe.</hi> What sayes <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus?</hi> O Lord, if
thou knowest so much, Why doest thou put thy selfe to so vnnecessary a trouble?
Why doest thou loose so much time? Wherunto there is giuen a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
answer.</p>
            <p>First, That he that is of a pittifull nature and kind condition,
doth not content himselfe with the iustifying of his cause, but vseth all
possible meanes to remedy what is amisse, and to set all things right. S.
<hi>Bernard</hi> did labour as it were with might and maine, as no Gally-slaue
could tugge more at an Oare, to reduce a Monke that had violated his Orders and
gone astray; and when a friend of his told him, What meane you to meddle in so
thanklesse and hopelesse an Office, and a case so desperate, where there is no
good to bee done? This man is flowne out so farre to checke, that he will neuer
be reclaimed. To whom Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> mildly answered, <hi>Non recipio
consolationem, vbi fratris video desolationem, I take no consolation, where I
see my brothers desolation.</hi> A tender hearted mother takes care of her
sonne in a desperate disease, vsing all kind of diligences, though they prooue
vnprofitable.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Saint <hi>Barnard</hi> saith, That God doth not oblige
Prelats, that they cure sinners, but that they procure to cure them. He doth
not reward a Preacher according to the good that he hath done, but according to
the paines that hee hath taken; and he cites that place of Saint <hi>Paul, I
haue laboured more than ye all.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi>
  15.</note> 
               <pb n="562" facs="tcp:22083:301"/> He doth not say, <hi>I haue done more good
than any of you all</hi>; for the reward is not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen according to the measure
of the profit, but the paines; not for the sauing of Soules, but for his
sweating to saue them. And for the better instructing vs in this truth, our
Sauiour Christ after so many myracles done, so many Sermons preached, and all
to no end, doth not for all this forsake this people, and giue them ouer, but
comes here vnto this great Feast, to direct them in the right way, <hi>Et
deambulabat, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Then came the Iewes round about him.</hi> The Woolfes heere
come about the Lambe, as your Dogs about a poore Beggar, as your bigger Vessels
about a smal Fisher boat, or as your Sodomites about <hi>Lots</hi> house, or
<hi>Sauls</hi> soldiers about <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid; In modum coronae, They had shut him
in on all sides,</hi> as a band of souldiers beset a Castle, or as the Wicked,
the Iust; which is as much to say, <hi>In circuitu Impij ambulabant, The Wicked
walked in a Circle</hi>: And they learned this of the Deuill; of whom Saint
<hi>Peter</hi> saith, <hi>He goes about seeking whom hee may deuoure. They came
about him</hi>: Vpon so good a day, a day of good workes, and on the day of the
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouation of the Temple, when they were to treat of the renouation of their
soules; <hi>Circumdederunt,</hi> They came athwart two walls, which would haue
made euen the Deuills of Hell to haue turned cowards.</p>
            <p>The one was, The respect to this so solemne a Feast.</p>
            <p>The other, To the Temple, and the sacred Pledges thereunto
belonging.</p>

gaming, ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queting, whoring, and the like villanous actions, for the Sabboth
day. <hi>Nazian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen</hi> saith, That the principall end of this or the like
Feast, is a remembring of God, and a gratefull acknowledgement of those many
fauours wee haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from him: but that which was then, and is now a
dayes most practised, is, a forgetfulnesse of God, and an vnthankefulnesse for
benefits receiued. Where I would haue you to obserue,<note place="margin">God did
  his greatest works always on the Sunday.</note> (nor is it vnworthy your
noting) that God did on the Sabboth day do the greatest works that euer hee
did; he rewarded the Angels, crowning them with glorie, he threw the Dragon
&amp; his followers down from Heauen, hee freed his people from Aegypts
captiuitie, hee was borne into the world, after so many sighes hee rose againe,
he sent his holy Spirit, he ouercame the vnbeleefe of <hi>Thomas</hi>; &amp; on
the Sabboth day he shall iudge the Quicke &amp; the Dead. In a word, all your
festiuall dayes whatsoeuer, were instituted in memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall of extraordinarie
fauours conferred vpon vs: and all these, the Ingratefull repay with new

               <note place="margin">God will haue his Temples

layd to our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Christs charge, one was, <hi>I can destroy the

himselfe of the same omnipotencie with God; but for his irreuerence also, and
disrespect to the Temple. Saint <pb n="563" facs="tcp:22083:301"/> 
               <hi>Augustine</hi> in

as many as betooke themselues to the Churches of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> and Saint

preuaile with these cruell Barbarians: but it would not serue our Sauiour
Christs turne with the Iewes, though he had made a Law touching the immunitie

               <hi>They came about me.</hi> They did fill and shut vp the doore

either God,<note place="margin">God will not suffer his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

wings to flye from them. To this purpose <hi>Dauid</hi> being persecuted by

compassed him in round, <hi>In modum Coronae,</hi> Vowing, that he should not
escape their fingers, vnlesse hee had the wings of a bird to flye from them.
<hi>In the Lord put I my trust, Why say you then vnto my soule that she should

<hi>Saul</hi> did not liue in himselfe, but in <hi>Dauid; Haman</hi> not in

they confesse these their so many distractions, vexations, and torments of the
mind. All other kind of sinnes bring paine and torment with them, but it is
after they haue tasted of their sinnes; but Enuie torments before hand. The
Pharisees had scarce seen Christs Miracles, and the applause which his doctrine
had in the world, when they began to suffer, and to be grieued. And this is the
reason why this Vice is harder to be cured than any other. Good doth ordinarily
quench ill, as water quencheth fire. But Enuie, because it makes another mans
good his ill, that which to other vices is death, is to Enuy, life. It is the
fire of brimstone, which the more water you throw on it, the more it burneth.

It is a sin inherited from <hi>Adam,</hi> who laid the fault of eating the

the Clymat wherein hee liueth, and on those meates wherewith hee is nourished.
<hi>Seneca</hi> tells a tale of a certaine Shee-slaue, who one morning when she
awaked, finding her selfe blind, laid the fault that she could not see, vpon
the house, desiring that she might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooued to another. The cause of your
Eclypses is the earth, which interposes it selfe betweene the Sunne and the
Moone: Whereas hee that shall impute the fault to the Sun, shall but betray his
ignorance. Of the Eclipses of these Iewes, the cause thereof was their
passions, their couetousnesse, and their enuie. If our Sauiour Christ preached
vnto them, they desired Miracles; if he wrought Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, 
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:22083:302"/> they desired Doctrine; from his workes they appealed to
his words, and from his words to his workes; and laying the fault on the Sun,
they said, <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam nostram tollis, Thou makest vs to doubt.</hi>

               <hi>If thou be the Christ, tell vs plainly.</hi> In three words

            </p>
            <p>The first, <hi>Dic nobis palam, Tell vs plainly</hi>; for all that
thou hast hitherto sayd vnto vs, is as nothing.</p>
            <p>The second, <hi>Dic nobis palam,</hi> and we will beleeue
thee.</p>
            <p>The third, <hi>Dic nobis palam</hi>; for that is the reason why
wee haue not hitherto beleeued thee. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> and Saint
<hi>Chrysostome</hi> haue both obserued, that in these their lies there was a
great deale of craft &amp; subtletie; which was this, That the Iewes did still
presume, that our Sauiour Christ would boast himselfe to bee King of the Iewes,
and that he was temporally to sit in <hi>Dauids</hi> Throne; &amp; they went
about to draw this from him, that they might haue some ground of accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
against him; and therefore they thus cried out vnto him, <hi>Dic nobis palam,
Tel vs plainly:</hi> for in all the rest that they desired of him, our Sauiour
Christ had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen them full satisfaction. For if <hi>Palam</hi> be to publish a
thing openly, and not to doe it in hugger-mugger, or in some by-corner or
other, I haue alwayes prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched publiquely in your Synagogues, and in the
middest of your Market-pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>And I sayd nothing in secret.</hi> If
<hi>Palam</hi> shall carrie with it a kind of boldnesse and libertie, yee may
call to mind my whipping of you out of the Temple, the seueritie of my
reprehensions, and that I called yee the children of the Deuill, that I might
publish your euill thoughts to the world, &amp;c. If <hi>Palam</hi> shall
sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, Cleerely or Manifestly, what more cleere or manifest truth could ye
heare, than that which I haue preached vnto you? Wil you that I shal tel you in
a word, who I am, <hi>I and the father am one.</hi> Of the materiall Sunne a
man may complaine, That an earnest eying of it, and a steadie fixed looking
thereupon, may make vs blind; but on the Sunne of Righteousnesse no man can lay
this fault, for hee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe giues that light whereby our eyes are inabled to
see;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 19.</note> 
               <hi>The commandement of the
Lord is pure, and giueth light vnto the eyes.</hi> And therefore Saint
<hi>Paul</hi> calls the old Law, Night; and the Law of Grace, Day: In that Law
the Sunne had not shewed it selfe, all was clouds and darkenesse; and albeit
they did inioy some light, it was but a glimpse, or as the light of a candle
through some little chinke; but when the Sonne of God appeared in the flesh,
that darkenesse of the night was driuen away, and the day appeared, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I told yee and yee beleeue not; the workes that I doe in my
fathers name, they beare witnesse of me.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Iewes
  wanted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to make them beleeue, but a willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to beleeue.</note> Our
Sauiour Christ had prooued himselfe to be both God and Man, by such conuenient
meanes, that it had beene follie, if not meere madnesse, to haue desired better
proofs thereof: strong were his reasons, strange his myra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, profound his
discourse. In a word, his words &amp; workes were such, that they made
Admiration stand amased, and Wonder it selfe, to wonder. Your not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing me
(saith our Sauiour) cannot arise from my not speaking vnto you, but from your
wilfulnesse; but if yee will not beleeue in my words, giue credit to my
workes.</p>
            <p>Where by the way it is to be noted, That our Sauiour Christ hauing
innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable testimonies to alledge in his behalfe, those shall first be

&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here we may more especially consider with our selues, one
great and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular wonder, That these the Prophets liuing in diuers times and
places, &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecying different things that should befal our Sauior
Christ; as one, his stripes; another, his buffetings; a third, his patience; a
fourth, his silence, &amp;c. All of them did compose an excellent peece, &amp;
did set forth a most absolute and perfect picture of the Messias, for it was
the hand of the Holy-Ghost that directed the pensill: and, that the seuentie
Interpreters without seeing one another, without conuersing or communicating
their minds, should all of them jumpe and agree so well together, and extract
one and the same originall, was a great wonder. That the Statuaries of Greece,
liuing asunder in different Cities, should frame a figure in seuerall pieces,
one making the leg, another the arme, a third the head, and all of them meet in
handsomenesse, shape, feature, and proportion, as heart could wish; this
likewise (if it be true) was a great wonder. But in the Prophets the
circumstances were farre greater; as that of time, for that they were in
dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ages, and of different estates, conditions, and qualities,
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>The third is, The testimonie of his owne myracles; for (as
<hi>Athanasius</hi> and <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine Martyr</hi> haue noted) by an especiall
Diuine prouidence it was so ordered, that none of the Saints that were either
before or after, could doe any of those same myracles which were prophecyed of
our Sauiour Christ. And this did he himselfe deliuer to the Disciples of
<hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> Tell him (saith he) from me, <hi>The Blind receiue

            </p>
            <p>The Common people also did testifie of him, <hi>Testimonium

he would not here make vse of any other, than the testimonie of his workes.</p>

            <p>Secondly, To the end that no man should pretend to hold himselfe

Virgins who in good words proffered their seruice to the Spouse, but performed
nothing lesse in their deeds, because they had not their Lampes lighted and
readie at hand; <hi>Shew me thy faith by thy workes. Clemens Alexandrinus</hi>

Let no man trouble himselfe in enquiring after me, or to aske, Who I am? the
print of the yrons wherewith I am branded in the face, doth plainly speake my
name, and publish to the world my profession and condition. Hee borrowed this
metaphore from your branded slaues, or as <hi>Anselmus</hi> will haue it, from
some deuice born by the soldiers of the Roman Empire. Saint
<hi>Chrysostome</hi> ponders the word <hi>Porto</hi>; a Slaue may beare a marke
in his face, but <pb n="567" facs="tcp:22083:303"/> makes no great braggs of it, nor indeed
hath any great reason so to do: but Saint <hi>Paul</hi> he boasts thereof, as

Bridegroome, <hi>Weare me in thy heart, as a Spouse doth her ring on her
finger, or as a Louer doth his Mistresse fauour on his arme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But yee beleeue not, for yee are not of my Sheepe.</hi> Saint
<hi>Augustine</hi> vnderstands by these Sheepe, the Preachers of Gods Word,
because they heare the voyce of their Sheepheard; but this his opinion may not
stand as a generall sentence.</p>
            <p>First of all, Because many not predestinated, doe beleeue, heare,
and obey, as <hi>Iudas,</hi> and others that were not of Christs Sheepe.</p>
            <p>And many againe of the Predestinated, did not as then beleeue, (as
S. <hi>August.</hi> hath noted it) which afterwards came to beleeue. Now the
Sheepe is a fitting figure or symbole of him that is predestinated to
saluation; and touching those in particular to whom our Sauiour sayd, That they
were not of his Sheep, who notwithstanding had enioyed such powerfull and
plentifull meanes to beleeue, if they had beene in the number of Christs
Sheepe, doubtlesse they would haue beleeued: and therefore we are diligently to
weigh these words, <hi>Yee beleeue not, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next, we are to consider the conueniences which are betwixt the
Sheep and the Predestinated.</p>
            <p>The first is, <hi>They heare my voyce.</hi> There is no liuing
creature more obedient to what he heares, or more apt to heare; the least
whistle of the Sheepheard is the Sheepes North Starre. When God reprehended
<hi>Elias</hi> at the mouth of the Caue, there came first a great wind, <hi>And
God was not in the wind</hi>: then anon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter came an earthquake, <hi>And God
was not in the earthquake</hi>: after that, a flaming fire, <hi>And God was not
in the fire</hi>: at last there came a soft whistling sound, and then God
passed by. But why should he make his appearance in a whistle, or a soft
noyse?<note place="margin">Hot fierie Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits vnfit for the Ministery.</note>
Marrie therein he plainly told the Prophet, You, out of the aboundance of your
zeale and hot fierie spirit, would haue all to be winds, earthquakes, and
light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, thundering out nothing but damnation and vengeance; and howbeit I
hold this to be a fitting course to be taken with an idolatrous People, and
such as are Rebells to my House, yet for those that are my Sheep, a whistle or
a milde word is enough.</p>
            <p>The second is, The meekenesse, softnesse, and euennesse of their
nature and condition: <hi>Beati mites, B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>essed are the Meeke in spirit</hi>; your Reprobates are soure,
vnsauorie, and vnquiet: In a word, they are like Goats, you shall scarce meet
with a Reprobate but leads a troubled life, like a Theefe that lookes euery

<hi>Cain</hi> liued in; <hi>Cur concidit facies tua? Why is thy countenance
falne downe?</hi> And as it is in <hi>Deu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronomie, The Lord shall giue thee a
trembling heart, and a sorrowfull mind, and thy life shall hang before thee,
and thou shalt feare both day and night,</hi>
               <note place="margin">No torture to a
  guilty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</note> 
               <hi>and shalt haue none assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of thy life: in
the morning thou shalt say, Would God it were euening; and at eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thou
shalt say, Would God it were morning; for the feare of thyne heart which thou
shalt feare, and for the sight of thyne eyes which thou shalt see.</hi> The
heart of the Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked is fearefull, and euerie bush represents a Dog vnto him
that bites him. In the middest of all his pleasures Hell represents it selfe to
the Reprobate, his soule is consumed with sorrow, <hi>&amp; quasi pendens ante
se,</hi> He lookes like one that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to be hanged. But the Iust doth
enioy an inward comfort, a heauenly ioy, singing cherefully with <hi>Dauid</hi>
that sweet Anthem,<note place="margin">

               <hi>Inhabitat

feare him, that Glorie may dwell in our Land.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="568" facs="tcp:22083:304"/>The third is, the point of profit. For in
the Sheepe (which signifies the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect) there is wooll, milke, butter, cheese,
and flesh: But it is not so in the Goat, (whereby are noted the Reprobate) as
hath beene obserued by Saint <hi>Hilary</hi> and Saint
<hi>Chrysostome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fourth is, The sheepe walkes in wayes that are plaine, quiet,
and secure: But the goat goes clambring on the tops of dangerous rocks,
browzing amongst bushes and thornes; and at last waxing weary, falls down
headlong to hell. <hi>Ambu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lauimus vias difficiles, lassati sumus via

Familiaritie, contempt; Hope, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire; and Muchnesse of benefits, muchnesse
of obliuion; <hi>Incontinently they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat his workes. Dauid</hi> doth there
treat of the adoration of the golden calfe, and his meditation thereupon is,
That the many fauours that that people had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from Gods hands, being so
fresh as they were in their memories, as the flyes, (which for their sakes he
sent to afflict the Aegyptians) frogges, gnats, water tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into blood,
darknesse, the death of their first-borne, the Israelites passing safe through
the red sea, the drowning of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and all his charriots and
horsemen, and the Law giuen them on the Mountaine: yet notwithstanding these
great and singular fauours, these wondrous signes and tokens, as the like were
neuer done, that yet for all this, they should like a broken bow so sodainely
start aside, and fall so quickly into so foule a sinne, as none could be more
derogatory from Gods honour, <hi>They sodainely forgot his workes.</hi> The
greater were Gods benefits, the more was their obliuion. And the reason of it
is, That laying more vpon a mans shoulders than he is well able to beare, it is
a thousand to one that his load and he doe not fall both to the ground. The
lesse the benefits are, the more cheerefully a man receiues them. And why so?
Marry I shall tell you why: Because then there is some hope that a man may liue
to requite them, and to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge that debt, for the which (in thankfulnesse)
he stands bound. But when they are so great, that we are not able to make
satisfaction, such extraordinarie curtesies, are repayd oftentimes with
vnkindnes, if not with hatred. Thou ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est thy neighbour a summe of money, be
it more or lesse, nor does it grieue and afflict thee to see this thy Crediter,
or to looke him in the face, but rather takest pleasure and comfort in his
companie; yet if all that thou art worth, shouldst thou sell thy selfe to thy
very shirt, be not able to discharge that debt, thou hadst as liefe see the
diuell, as him. <hi>Quintus Curtius</hi> reporteth, that <hi>Alexander</hi>
grew to hate <hi>Antipater,</hi> and for no other reason in the world, but that
he had obtained so many victories, and reduced so many nations to his
obedience, that hee did ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citely demand that requitall of him, which he was
not able to make him: and conferring many fauours on those souldiers which had
done him but little ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, he neglected <hi>Antipater</hi> that had done him
most. The same reason is to bee <pb n="569" facs="tcp:22083:304"/> rendred of
<hi>Hannibal</hi> and Carthage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of <hi>Lycurgus</hi> and Lacedemonia, and
of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Dauid</hi>: but there is no example to that of a woman
in this kind; serue her ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer so faithfully, entertaine her neuer so royally,
court her day and night, feede her humorous disposition, wast both thy purse
and thy bodie, and consume all that thou hast to giue her content, yet in the
end will she grow to hate thee; and that which thou thinkest should be the
meanes of winning her, will be the cause of losing her: she will like a
Lymbeck, draw whatsoeuer is good from thee, first by drops, then by drams,
afterwards by ounces, &amp; lastly by pounds, till she haue suckt thee drie,
&amp; that thou hast wholly spent &amp; vndone thy selfe in her seruice. In a
word, (that I may grow to an end) the Iews in those former times were euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
wonderfully beholding vnto God for those many benefits &amp; fauors which he
had throwne vpon them; but now his grace and mercie (like a Riuer rising from
forth it's bed) extending it selfe so farre, that he came himselfe in person to
visit them, and in such an especiall manner, as none could bee more, saying
parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly vnto them, <hi>Non sum missus nisi ad Oues Israel, I am not sent
but to the Sheepe of Israel</hi>; Why this was so great a fauour, that it
ouercommeth mans imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the weight whereof prest both it and them to the
ground. But God so sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port vs with his grace, that we may thankefully beare in
our hearts the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of his manifold benefits. To whom, with the Father,
the Sonne, &amp;c.</p>

<hi>Thomas</hi> saith, That it is <hi>Peccatum maximae inhaerentiae,</hi> That
it is a sinne of all other that cleaueth closest vnto vs, and stickes longest
by vs. Saint <hi>Hierome,</hi> That it much resembleth the Bird called the
Phoenix, which doth reuiue and renew her selfe with the fire which she kindleth
with the motion of her wings. Thou mournest, thou bewai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest and repentest thee
of the dishonest sinne which thou hast committed, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirest to giue it
ouer, &amp; that it may dy in thee; but with the wings of thy thoughts thou
blowest those coles afresh, and makest them flame more than before, so that
thinking to kill the lusts of the flesh, thou doost quicken them &amp; giue
them new life; so that what thou bewailedst before for dead, thou now embracest
as liuing, and huggest it in thy bosome, as a man claspes his deerest friend in
his armes, that after some long swoune recouers againe. A holy Hermit that led
a deuour and solitarie life, talking one day with the Deuill, demanded of him,
Which amongst the Sinnes, was the greatest? He told him, Dishonestie. And he
replying, What, are not Blasphemie, Murther, and Swearing, far greater sinnes?
Whereun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o he answered, In point of
Diuinitie these are the greatest; but the Rents and In-comes of the sinnes of
the flesh are farre greater: and this is the reason why I doe not tempt any
with blasphemie or murther, but some one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate person or other; but with
dishonestie, all sorts of men; the Merchant im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployes his Stocke in that kind

                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.</note> as that of the Flesh; and this
was the cause that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented himself that he had made man: and if at any
time in the world there hath been any one that hath shewed himselfe so valiant
as to resist the assaults of hell, yet in the end the verie same partie hath
beene shrewdly encountred with the concupiscence of the flesh, as Saint
<hi>Gregorie</hi> hath noted it of <hi>Salomon, Et non cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stodiuit quae

               </gap>er.</p>
            <p>The second circumstance is, That it is an impudent and shamelesse
sinne; <hi>Marie Magdalen</hi> by this meanes losing all feare of God, and
shame of the world. When a Riuer runnes betweene two banks well planted with
trees which serue as wals to hedge it in, the waters thereof doe no harme; but
if these Riuers breake their bankes, and make their way ouer those walls, they
ouerflow and spoyle all that is in their way. Whilest our life shall bee
bounded in betwixt shame and feare, <pb n="571" facs="tcp:22083:305"/> no great harme can

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but when a Soule
shall liue deuoyd of shame or feare, Lord haue mercie vpon it. Our Sauiour
Christ, taking it to be the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie and vtmost of all euill, said of a
Iudge, <hi>I neither feare God nor Man</hi>: He that shall cast vp his accounts
with Heauen aboue, and with his Honour here beneath, and when he hath made this
reckoning, shall thinke with himselfe, that hee hath nothing to lose, What
bridle can rest<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aine him? One of
the reasons why God commanded, That a man should not defame his neighbour, was,
That he should not make his sinne perdurable. Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> saith,
That we should rather pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatly admonish, than publiquely punish, <hi>Lest if
such a one should once lose shame, he should dwell in his sinne for euer.</hi>
Amongst noble Natures, Honour is the bridle of Vice; and in case they should
not professe Vertue, yet will they haue a care to vphold their credit. Saint
<hi>Augustine</hi> saith, That God did not augment the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie of the Romans
for their vertue, because whilest they adored false gods they could hardly
professe it; but because hauing set Honour before their eyes, it was a great
bridle to curbe in their vices.</p>
            <p>The third circumstance is, That she should purchase her selfe the
name of a Sinneresse in so populous a Citie. This was it that made the
Euangelist say, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, a woman in the Citie which was a Sinner,</hi>
(this of Saint <hi>Luke</hi> was a great endee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the offence) <hi>De qua
septem Daemonia eiecerat, Out of whom hee had cast seuen Deuils.</hi> Now by
these seuen Deuils is to bee vnderstood the manifoldnesse of her sinnes; this
is Saint <hi>Gregories</hi> opinion: but Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> will haue
thereby to be vnderstood seuen reall Deuils indeed, <hi>He dried vp the issue
of bloud in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha, and droue out the Deuils in Marie</hi>; and it is no small
proofe thereof, that two Euangelists should expresse the same in plain and ful
words: for when one Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelist sets downe a thing in darke and obscure termes,
another vsually explaines the same; but Saint <hi>Marke</hi> and Saint
<hi>Luke</hi> both, herein agree and say, <hi>Out of whom he had cast seuen
Deuils</hi>; and Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> in the life of <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

chastisement which God did often vse in great sinnes.</p>
            <p>The fourth circumstance is, The great hurt which she occasioned to
the souls and bodies of men, a great cause whereof was her extreame
beautie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sambucus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The force of Beautie.</note>
amongst some of his Emblemes which hee hath made of humane beautie, he paints
forth in one of them, a Lyon, a Hare, a Fowle, and a Fish; for there is not any
creature more couragious than a Lyon, nor any more cowardly than a Hare; nor
any creature higher than the Fowle, nor lower in his mansion than the Fish; all
which, render and yeeld themselues prisoners to beautie. <hi>Balac</hi> liued
in great feare of Gods People, and when he could not get <hi>Balaam</hi> to
curse them, aduising with his Councell, (<hi>Balaam</hi> being the first
proiector) he sent (as <hi>Lyra</hi> noteth it) a squadron of the fairest women

time, and looke out some remedy for this sore, you may boldly say he is blind.
Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> painting foorth the fall of <hi>Lucifer,</hi> saith, That

infernall pit, there went out such a thicke smoke, that it darkened the Sun and
the Starres. And this is the stampe and figure of him that shall throw himselfe
downe headlong into the bottomlesse pit of dishonestie, whence commeth forth so
much smoke, that it blindeth the Sun of the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, and darkneth those
starres of the faculties of the soule.</p>
            <p>From these circumstances do I draw the difficulty of <hi>Mary
Magdalens</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion; grounding my supposition vpon these three
truths.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Gods glorie greater in our conuersion than
  creation.</note>The first, That for God to iustifie a soule, is a farre greater
matter than to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate heauen and earth, and all that therein is. This hath
beene prooued else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. And <hi>Iob</hi> exprest as much, when he said, The
creating of me was the least of thy mercies towards me, <hi>Exaltare</hi>
(saith <hi>Dauid</hi>) <hi>Exalt thy selfe ô God aboue the
heauens,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

               <hi>and let thy
glory be vpon all the earth, that thy beloued may bee deliuered.</hi> So that
if we should put into the one hand of God, the world created; and into the
other, a soule conuerted; the glory of this hand is the greater. And there are
two very good reasons for it:</p>
            <p>The one, For that in the creating of the world, God had no
repugnancie or resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance;<note place="margin">To conuert a sinner, is a worke

conuerting of a soule, he may meet with opposition, by reason of mans peruerse
will, <hi>Et qui creauit te sine te, non saluabit te sine te, For though bee
created thee without thy will, he will not saue thee w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>thout thy will.</hi> God takes more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in
conuerting a soule, than in all the rest of those wonders which he wrought with
his hands, <hi>Auerte oculos tuos à me, quia ipsi me auolare fecerunt,
Turne away thine eyes from me; for euen they haue made me flye away.
Auolare</hi> is the same in that place, as <hi>Superbire, inflare. Rabby
Salomon</hi> renders it, <hi>Insolentior factus sum animo.</hi> To see thy eyes
heretofore so withdrawne from me, and now so busie in behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e. So great is the contention,
which is betwixt the loue of God, and the loue of the world, betweene the
desires of the flesh, and of the Spirit, That the one doth striue to take the
sword out of the others hand: 
<q> 
                  <l>—Alterius vires, subtrahit alter amor.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Plotinus</hi> calls Loue a Painter: Diuine Loue, that paints;
and humane Loue, that paints: This painteth forth our felicitie in riches,
beauty, and feasting; That, in pouerty, teares, and fasting. For, to ingraue
such an image as this in our hearts, to paint such a picture, we must blot out
all those colours, which any other loue hath drawne there.</p>
            <p>The other, For that in creating the world, God did not shew
himselfe to bee weary, but made it as it were a kind of entertainment, and
passe-time, <hi>Ludens in orbe terrarum</hi>: But in redeeming mankind, he was
wearied out, euen to the shed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of his blood, and the loosing of his
life.</p>
            <p>The second truth is, That it is the easiest thing in the world
with God, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich a sinner with his grace. God sent <hi>Ieremy</hi> to the
Potters house, who begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to worke vpon a peece of clay, it not fadging to
his mind, he tore it in sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and molding it anew, fashioned it afterwards
to his owne good liking and content. Ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not I deale by you as the potter doth
with his clay? Is my power lesse than his? <hi>Noah</hi> kept a Lyon in the
Arke, but he continued still a Lyon. But our Sauiour Christ in his Church
turnes the Lyon into a Lambe, <hi>The pots in the Lords <pb n="573" facs="tcp:22083:306"/>

And <hi>Niuale compede vinctum,</hi> saith <hi>Horace</hi> of the riuer Iberus.

it with grace.</p>
            <p>The third, That in regard of Man, it is a thing of great
difficulty; especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if the foule fiend hath got the masterie and
possession of our will. When a man hath hyred a house for terme of life, with
the liking and consent of it's ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, for to put such a one out, we must
necessarily haue the absolute <hi>Posse</hi> and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of the king, we must
haue his authority to turne him out. The diuell hauing taken a long lease of
the house of thy soule, with thy good liking and consent, thou must haue Gods
absolute power to eiect him, and thrust him out: Not that the diuell is so
powerfull as some make him, howbeit the Scripture tearmeth him, <hi>Vectem

winding serpent which clewes himselfe vp close, and vpon the least aduantage
takes hold (like the Cuttle-fish) with his clawes; but because God, howbeit he
can doe whatsoeuer he will, is now and then content to giue him leaue to worke
vpon our will.</p>
            <p>This difficultie is somewhat the more increased,<note place="margin">Woman the hieroglyphike of weaknes. <hi>Prou.</hi> 30.</note> in

foure things are too hard for me.</hi> The Hebrew renders the word,

an Eagle in the aire; the other of a Serpent vpon a stone; the third, of a ship
in the midst of the sea, and the fourth, of a young man in his youth (being so
mutable a creature, and so full of foolish longings.) Euen such is the way of
an adulterous woman, <hi>Which eateth and wipeth her mouth, and saith, I haue
not done ill.</hi> When a woman is greedy in deuouring good morsells in secret
behind the doore, and wiping her lips, tells the world she hath fasted and
eaten nothing all that day; when shee commits folly in a corner, and boasts her
selfe in publike to be honest, saying, There is not that woman liuing that
liues more honestly than I doe; the diuell hauing taken such possession of her
soule, it is a desperate peece of businesse.</p>
            <p>All these circumstances of difficultie, and many more which wee

            <p>With this threatning sermon, expressing so many and such terrible

within her, and Gods Iustice did beat so strongly at the doore of her brest,
that at last she let him in. For in a word, his words are that fire which
warmeth soules, that ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer which breakes the hardnesse of our hearts, that
shaft which pierceth the bones and marrow, that sword which diuideth the reynes
in sunder, and that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction which gaue an accomplishment and final

            <p>Thirdly, of the misery of her estate.</p>
            <p>The Law entred in by giuing her this knowledge, <hi>Wee had not

<pb n="576" facs="tcp:22083:308"/> but for the soule, that which is fittest for it, is to
notifie vnto it, that it is either at Heauens doore, or Hells gate. Saint
<hi>Augustine</hi> confesseth, that his conuersion was by these steps, <hi>Tu

            </p>
            <p>God likewise did <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> a great fauour, in
discouering vnto her the faire and beautiful face of Vertue,<note place="margin">The fairenes of vertue.</note> kindling in her brest those hot
coles of Loue. A sinner in his vices and vaine pleasures, is like vnto a horse,
of whom <hi>Iob</hi> saith, That in hearing the noyse of the trumpet sounding
to warre, hee enters into the battaile with great courage, scorning all kind of
feare whatsoeuer. Vertue (me thinks) should not be of worse condition. And the
iust knowing his own strength, and how faire and beautifull he is in Gods
sight, it is not much that hee should couragiously enter the listes, laying
aside all feare.</p>
            <p>Secondly, she knew the season of this her happinesse, <hi>That
Iesus sat at Table in the house of Simon the Leper,</hi> and shee would not
loose so faire an opportunitie; which being once lost is hardly recouered. The
vocations and inspirations of God,<note place="margin">

are euery dayes example, <hi>The waters saw thee and were afraid, the depths

went abroad, the voyce of thy thunder was round about, the lightnings lightned
the world, &amp;c.</hi> Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, That the Prophet here
treateth of the effect of Gods word, and compares it to those things which
passe and quickly disappeare, as the noyse of a rushing of waters, or of some
greatwhirle-wind, or arrowes shot with a strong arme, or of thunder and
lightning. These are things whilest they last, which doe much amase, mooue, and
disquiet vs, <hi>The earth saw it and was mooued at it.</hi> But these things

That she stayed to take her Mantle with her, nor that she opened any coffer, or

all the hast she could. And when she knew that <hi>hee sat at Table</hi> in the
house of <hi>Simon</hi> the Leaper, it was a watchword vnto her, that this was
now a fit time for her to come vnto him. For hee that would not loath the

by the hole of the doore, and mine heart was affectioned towards him. My
welbeloued his putting in of his hand, is my calling of me. And therefore our
Sauiour Christ when he saw <hi>Mary Magdalens</hi> modestie, and that out of

            <p>
               <hi>She brought a boxe of oyntment, &amp;c.</hi> This was a
certaine signe and assured to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of her generall change and alteration. In the
old Law, those women that did wholy giue ouer the world, and did consecrate
themselues to the Temple, did <pb n="577" facs="tcp:22083:308"/> offer vp those glasses,
wherein they before beheld themselues, being a iewell of great esteeme amongst
women, as being a meanes to preserue their beauties, and repaire those wrongs
that any spot of foulenesse should doe the face: And <hi>Moses</hi> made a
Lauatorie of Copper, for the Priests to wash themselues in, adorning the same
with these kind of glasses. For she that shall forgo the world, and strip her
selfe of all euen to her very glasse, wherein she was wont to looke, the
holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Priests may looke that woman in the face without sinning.</p>
            <p>There are certaine sinners which will not let slip any occasion
that offers it selfe vnto them. <hi>Petrus Chrysologus</hi> likens these vnto
diuells. Amongst the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesenes, our Sauiour Christ commanding the diuells
that they should come out of those men that liued in the fields in the
Sepulchres and graues of the dead, as if they were houses of peace and
pleasure, they besought him that he would suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them to goe into the heard of
Swine, to wit, out of one filthy place into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and so in like manner
from sinne to sinne. Others there are, that all their life long, haue tyde
themselues fast to Occasions girdle, &amp; haue as it were sworn and made a
vow, neuer to forsake her: These two sorts of sinners <hi>Ieremie</hi> poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

Now, which will first change his skinne and condition, either the tanned

accustomes and vses himselfe to change and alter euery houre; and like the
Cameleon, puts on as many colours as come neere him; Which of these two Estates
I say is the more dangerous? I answer, That amongst Reprobat people there is
not a pin to chuse: But amongst those sinners that hope for heauen, That of the
Cameleon seemeth to bee the more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; because it may be presumed from
his ordinary reincidencie, that in the confession of his sinnes, he neuer
truely repents himselfe of them; whence great Sacriledges are wont to succeede.
But for the other, it may so fall out, That hee may be as constant in good, as

and grew fearefull and timerous to looke him in the face, and had not the heart
to presse into his presence that was to be her soules best Physician, God did
cast her sinnes behind his backe. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> touches vpon this
string, vpon those words of <hi>Dauid; Auerte faciem tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am à peccatis

(saith the same Father) I shall giue thee a good remedy for this, <hi>Tu inde

which is foule, more foule. There are some glasses which makes all those
appeare faire which fall within the view of them. A glasse standing in a
window, makes the opposite wall glitter and shine the more. The Raine-bow
leaues that fairest, which leaneth neerest to it. The Sunne setting vpon a
darke cloud, makes him become as bright as gold. In like manner our Sauiour
Christ layd open to <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> the foulenesse of her sinnes, that
he might leaue her more faire and more beautifull than shee was before.</p>

cryes out, <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> what meanest thou by this? Commest thou as

haue beene, she would not that he should haue seen her; though such was her
wretched case, That she was driuen to desire his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour and best furtherance.
The sick Patient cannot flye from the Physition which is willing to cure him.
In this perplexitie and anguish of her soule, shee resolued with her selfe to

<hi>Iobs</hi> desire, <hi>Quis mihi det, vt in Inferno protegas me, &amp;
abscondas me, donec transeat furor tuus,</hi> &amp;c. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi>
saith,<note place="margin">The way to flie from God, is to flie vnto him.</note>
That if it were possible for a sinner to flye from God, it were not the worst
remedie to hide himselfe whilest his furie be ouerpast and his anger quite
gone. But it being of necessitie, that he must fall into Gods hands, and that a
sinner can no where hide himselfe from his all-seeing eye, the best counsell
were to aduise him, That to escape Gods hands, hee should put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe into
Gods hands, and prostrate himselfe at his feet. <hi>Ionas</hi> flying from God,
told the Marriners, <hi>I feare the Lord God of heauen, which made the sea, and
the dry land.</hi> If God then be the God both of sea and land, Why didst thou
seeke to flye from him by going to sea?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>By or neere vnto his feet.</hi> When a Huntsman woundeth a
Deere with a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked arrow that is sent from a strong bow, though the Deere may
bound and stand vp for a while, yet at last he sinkes and falls downe at the
Keepers foot. Our Sauiour Christ had wounded <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> with the
arrow of his word, he strooke her to the very heart, the barbes thereof
sticking in the sides of her soule, <hi>Sagittae potentis acutae cum carbonibus
dissolatorijs.</hi> This Deere of his was so sorely wounded, That she was
forced to fall downe at his feet in the house of <hi>Simon</hi> the Leaper. One
of the greatest glories that was prophesied of our Sauiour Christ, was, That he
should make his enemies his foot-stoole. And in another place, <hi>His enemies
shall bow themselues downe before him, and licke the earth.</hi> And this is
one of the greatest happinesses that can befall Gods enemie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And she fell a weeping. Pliny</hi> saith, That one of the
Offices which Nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed on the eyes,<note place="margin">The office of the
  Eye.</note> was, That they might serue as a Limbeck or Stillatorie to the
heart; from whence it might distill it's sadnesse and sorrow, and easing it
selfe of so heauy a load, it might thereby inioy some comfort. Saint
<hi>Gregory</hi> expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that place of the Lamentations, <hi>Mine eye
casteth out water,</hi> because the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter that should refresh my soule, is
farre from me, saith, That as the Gardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner doth deriue the water from the
<hi>Estanque</hi> or poole where it is kept, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyes it to the borders in
the garden, or the plants in the orchard: so a true Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent ought to direct
the teares of his eyes to euery one of those sinnes which he hath committed.
And because <hi>Mary Magdalens</hi> teares were many, the Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>list saith,
That she did <hi>Rigare lachrymis,</hi> Showre downe teares. Saint
<hi>Bernard</hi> saith, That teares worke two effects:</p>

            <p>The other, To wash it.</p>
            <p>And therefore he that doth not gutter downe teares, hath commonly
a hard and a foule heart. Hard, because teares are they that soften and
mollifie the <pb n="579" facs="tcp:22083:309"/> heart, as Water doth the earth: And as in a
ground that is destitute of water, howbeit Fruit may grow therein, yet doth it
neuer come to it's perfect ripenesse, <hi>It withered as soone as it came vp,
because it wanted moysture.</hi> In like sort, the Soule which is not made
tender with teares, although it may bud forth some flowers and leaues of good
intentions, yet it neuer comes to beare fruit. Foule, because there is not that
Collyrium or medicine which can so clense and cleere the eyes of the Soule, as
Teares, though the eyes of the bodie should waxe blind with weeping.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>She began to fall a weeping.</hi> We know the beginning of
these teares, but not the end; for that fountaine of teares which had it's
Well-head and spring at the feet of our Sauiour Christ, did neuer grow emptie
or drie in the eyes of <hi>Marie Magdalen.</hi> Saint <hi>Basil</hi> askes the
question, How it comes to passe that teares some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times should come vpon vs
without desiring them, and at other times, though we desire them neuer so much,
we are not able to shed a teare? And his reason is, That we haue them now &amp;
then, God being willing to giue vs a taste of them; for the Soule that once
tasteth of the sweetnesse of teares, will not leaue them for a world: for, as
those vapors that are exhaled from those salt and bitter wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the sea,
being conuerted into clouds, are afterwards resolued into a sweet and sauorie
water; so those sighes and sobbs arising from a sad and sorrowfull Soule for
hauing offended the Maiestie of God, beeing conuerted into Clouds of feare,
resolue themselues at last into most sweet &amp; most sauorie teares.<note place="margin">Teares some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times denied vs for our pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment.</note>
Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whiles God denies them vnto vs, though we seeke after them neuer so much,
in punishment of our forepassed negligence: for it is no reason that hee should
on the sudden inioy so great a good, who by long exercise hath not deserued
them.</p>
            <p>Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> after that he was conuerted, saith, That
his eyes were two Fountaines, and that he was verie well pleased they should
bee so; <hi>Fluebant la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chrymae, &amp; bene mihi erat cum illis. Dauid</hi>
after that he had sayd, That euery night he washed his couch with teares; that
is, <hi>Per singulas noctes, Night after night</hi>;<note place="margin">Teares
  for sin must neuer haue an end.</note> (according to Saint
<hi>Chrysostome</hi>) he addeth, <hi>Amplius laua me,</hi> he calleth for more
and more teares still: for weeping must haue a beginning, but neuer haue an

shee then tooke most pleasure when she wept most. <hi>Iacob</hi> had put on a
purpose, neuer to leaue off weeping as long as he liued; Surely I will goe
downe vnto the Graue to my sonne mourning, I shall neuer haue drie eyes till I

(saith <hi>Chrysologus</hi>) considering these teares that were poured forth
vpon our Sauiours feet, cannot but confesse, That these are those Waters that

so many in their quantitie: The like may be sayd of <hi>Marie Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lens</hi>
teares, neuer was there that woman in the world that shed so many, and such
rich and pretious teares, as she, nor that presentedthe like from her eyes, to
the <pb n="580" facs="tcp:22083:310"/> true <hi>Salomon. Zachary</hi> sets forth
<hi>Dauid</hi> for an example of the penitent, <hi>Et erit, qui offenderit ex
eis in illa die, sicut Dauid.</hi> In the new Law it is said, That sinners
shall rise vp with that zeale and earnest feruour from their sinues, as did
<hi>Dauid</hi>: But the Prophet had not then the example of <hi>Mary
Magdalen</hi>; if he had, hee would haue preferd her before him in that deluge
of teares. God treating of clensing the world of it's sins, he rayned down more
&amp; more water; but that was not a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent or effectuall remedy: on Sodom
he rayned down more &amp; more fire; but that likewise would doe no good.
Sithence that neither water of it selfe, nor fire of it selfe, wil do the deed,
let a Lee be made of fire and water together, for there is not that spot or
staine, which that will not take out. This Lee, is the teares which come from
the vapours of the braine, and the fire of the heart. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi>
weighing how mute <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> stood, sayes vnto her, <hi>Quid
quaeris? Quid dicis Maria?</hi> What wouldst thou haue? What doest thou seeke
after? What, nothing but weepe? Why doest thou not speake? She had found too
much sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row to find a tongue.<note place="margin">Deepe sorrow wants a
  tongue.</note> They grieue but little that can expresse their griefe: No
maruell then if she were dumbe-strucken, that was so heart-strucken. The sweet
songs of the Syrens haue been turned into sorrowfull sighes; the pleasing and
delight fullest voyce, being altered by the heat of the blood, hath admitted of
a change, and beene turned into sad howlings and dolefull notes. And as at the
death of some great Captaine, the drums beat harsh and dead, and render a
dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full sound; and in stead of shrill and cheerefull flourishes, the trumpets
sound hoarse; so now in this our <hi>Mary Magdalens</hi> death (who was the
chiefe Captaine and Ring-leader of the vices of that Citie) a hollow sound of
sighes was heard, and a grieuous noyse of confused grones and broken throbs,
breathing out these wofull words: ô my good Lord, I haue beene like vnto
the Serpent, for on the one side I sustained my selfe by the earth, without
once offering to lift mine eyes from the earth; on the other side, I did
prostrate my selfe, laying traps and snares for thy feet, soliciting the men of
this City to tread thy Lawes vnder their feet. Oh Lord, since I haue thus playd
the Serpent, tread thou vpon mee, crush me in the head, and bruise out all the
venome that is in me. O sweet Iesus, the Serpent vseth to enter in betweene the
rocks, and rub off her old skinne, and leauing it there behind her, to renew
her selfe againe: I much desire to cast off my old skinne, and to leaue it in
the wounds of these thy feet, and on my strong rocke Christ Iesus. I wot well
ô Lord, that so vile and lewd a woman as I am, is to be made no more
reckoning of, than the durt that is trod vnder foot in the streetes, <hi>Mulier
fornicaria, quasi stercus in via conculcabitur.</hi> But many times the dung of

<hi>Ambrose</hi> asketh the question, Why some of his Apostles did not wash our
Sauiours feet, either before or after that he had washt all theirs? He renders
two reasons:</p>
            <p>The one, for that <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> had washt them, and hee
would not that this lustre which those her tears had giuen them, should be lost
by washing them with ordinarie and common water. And the comparison is good,
For he that is washed with the water of Angels, will refuse to be washed with
any other water.</p>
            <p>The other (saith Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi>) for that we should wash
those his diuine feet, with the teares of our eyes. That mysticall lauing of
the Apostles feet, which <pb n="581" facs="tcp:22083:310"/> was directed to the cleansing
of their soules, could not fit with our Sauiour Christ, who was free from the
least filth of sinne: If any Lauatorie likes him, it is that of our teares,
because in them the heart is softned Besides, Those eyes and hayres which were
so well imployed, did expresse her good desire and thoughts. And there is not
any Sacrifice so acceptable vnto God, as to see the desires and thoughts of our
hearts to be offered vp at his feet. <hi>Chrysologus</hi> saith, That after God
had seene the resolution and courage of <hi>Abraham</hi> in the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing of
his sonne, he cared not a rush for all the rest; and therefore cryed vnto him,
<hi>Lay not thine hand vpon the child, neyther doe any thing vnto

               <hi>for now I know thou

               <hi>My sister, my spouse,
thou hast wounded mine heart: Thou hast wounded my heart with one of thine
eyes, and with a hayre of thy necke.</hi> Following the selfe-same Metaphor, to
wit, That the hayres are the thoughts, and the eyes, the desires. As if her
belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued should haue said vnto her, One desire, one thought my spouse, one
resolute determination, one firme purpose, hath quite robd me of my heart. And
he that shall indeere the delight that he takes in one single hayre, will take
much more pleasure in that whole skayne of gold. <hi>Bonauenture</hi> sayes,
That shee did behold our Sauiour by stealth, and peeping through the lattice of
her hayres, did euer and anon snatch a sight of him; But after that she had
once inioyed the brightnes of his face, and the sweetnes of his eyes, whence he
shot forth such sweet shafts of loue, and that did light so right vpon her,
that her heart was taken therewith; It seeming vnto her, That the skie was now
cleere, and the weather very faire and prosperous, she did vnruffle the sides
of her haires, and spred them abroad to the wind, finding so good a gale. And
as he that hath escaped many dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous fits of death at sea, is neuer
satisfied with kissing the earth when hee comes ashoare: so <hi>Mary
Magdalen</hi> thought shee could neuer haue her fill of kissing the blessed
earth, of those her Sauiours most holy feet. And as the Traueller that hath
passed through the deserts of Arabia, his mouth being as dry as those san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
grounds, or as tinder that is ready to take fire, being driuen to drinke of
foule and vnsauourie puddles, no sooner comes to a cleere fountaine, but hee

at this feast, with two great <hi>regalos,</hi> or dainties.</p>
            <p>The one, That it was she that made him the feast. For albeit the
Pharisee had inuited him, he had not set before him one sauourie morsell: For
what could sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour well in the house of a proud scorner that is giuen to mocke
and scoffe? And howbeit for the body, the cheere was good enough, yet if it had
not beene for <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> the soule might haue fasted. But she did
supply that defect, by affording matter to our Sauiour, to taxe the Pharisee of
discourtesie, &amp;c. <hi>Seest thou this woman? I entred into thy house, and
thou gauest me no water to my feete: but she hath washed my feet with teares.
Thou gauest me no kisse: But shee since the time that I came in, hath not
ceased to kisse my feet. Mine head with oyle thou didst not annoynt, 
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:22083:311"/> but she hath annoynted my feet with oyntment,</hi>
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>The other, That at the feet of our Sauiour she made a generall
sacrifice of all those things, wherewith she had before offended him; as of her
eyes, mouth, hayres, hands, heart, and soule, not leauing out so much as that
her oyntment, which is that which women are loathest to leaue, and doe latest
and hardliest part withall. Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> saith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That <hi>Mary
Magdalen</hi> did climbe vp to heauen by the same rounds, by which she went
downe to hell. Wee make a rope of our vices, and a ladder of our sinnes, by
which we descend to hell. In some, their eyes are the instruments of their
destruction, in others their hayres, in others their dainties and delicacies
in; <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> all whatsoeuer she possessed: Shee was the net that
swept all the vices vnto her; and all those good blessings which God had
bestowed vpon her, she had made them weapons wherewith to offend him. And as
the souldier that yeelds himselfe, holding his weapon by the point, offers it
to the Conqueror; so did <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> ô Lord (said she) with
these weapons haue I offended thee, but now I here lay them downe at thy
feet.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If this man were a Prophet, he would surely haue known who,
&amp;c.</hi> God doth so kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and so louingly entertaine all those that are

He that hath kild thy brother, if thou know him not, thou welcommest him to thy
house, and settest him at thy table: behold heere the immensiue Loue of God,
for that which thou doest out of meere ignorance, God doth here doe it out of
cleere knowledge. If thou shalt bewayle thy sinnes and offences, thou shalt
finde God after that manner, as if either he had not knowne thy faults at all,
or if hee did know them, that hee had quite forgot them. In a word, here the

any of the former. As this fire that came downe from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, consumed the

the sinnes of <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> were many, the reasons before alledged,
the seuen diuels driuen out of her, (deliuered by Saint <hi>Marke</hi> and
Saint <hi>Luke</hi>) and the name of Sinneresse in so populous a City, are
sufficient testimonies of this truth. But a stronger proofe thereof are those
words vttered by our Sauior Christ, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny sinnes are forgiuen her.</hi>
Wherein we are to consider his franknesse and freenesse <pb n="584" facs="tcp:22083:312"/>
in forgiuing: Shewing his power and omnipotencie in nothing more, than in
pittying our infirmities, and pardoning our offences. For, that so great a
forgiuer of sinnes should say, <hi>Many sinnes are forgiuen thee,</hi> doth
argue, that her sinnes were many. And would to God, That those many
<hi>deuotos</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or seruants, that are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoted to <hi>Mary
Magdalen,</hi> be not more for those many sinnes which she had before she was
conuerted, than those many deseruings which she afterwards had. For we haue
reason to be iealous of our selues, that we are more affected to sins than
teares, to carelesnesse than repentance. For we daily see in our liues and
conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations many sinnes like vnto hers, but little or no repentance like
hers. Many comfort themselues with the teares of this holy woman, this blessed
Saint of God; it seeming vnto them, that they haue a kind of confidence in
their brests, that they likewise shall bewaile their sins as she did. It is no
wonder to see them sinne at euery step, but it were a wonder to find them euery
foot weeping. They will follow her in her faults, but not in her amendment; in
her sins, but not in her teares. <hi>Nazianzen</hi> saith of himselfe,
<hi>Diutius viuendo, nihil aliud assequor, quam vt maiorem vitiorum aceruum

he cannot amend as he would; and that the longer his life lasteth, the more
sinne he treasureth vp: but the sinner doth treasure vp venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for the day
of vengeance, but neuer sheds a teare to wash away his sins, and to quench
those flames of hell, which without them, his soule may eternally suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer. O

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He high Priests and the Pharisees called a Councell, to sit vpon
the weightiest cause that was euer consulted of vpon earth: wherein foure
things did concurre.</p>
            <p>First of all, A Councell for to deliberate what course were best
to be taken; for amongst many, the truth would be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter debated; and in
graue businesses, it is fit that persons should be called thereunto, that are
men of Authoritie and Learning.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="585" facs="tcp:22083:312"/>Secondly, therefore the high Priests are
called to this Councell.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the Pharisees, who sat as Iudges vpon all matters
touching doubts of Faith, and causes of Religion.</p>
            <p>Fourthly and lastly, The cause of this Councell or Consultation;
which was, our Sauiours raising vp of <hi>Lazarus.</hi> For they saw that this
Myracle had conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted many, <hi>Collegerunt ergo Concilium, They called
therefore a Councell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hitherto all goes well, a faire course was taken; but in the end
they mar'd all by plotting mischiefe against our Sauiour Christ. It had beene
better for them to haue receiued him, to haue approoued those prophesies which
were foretold of him, and to haue inlightned the people by instructing them in
this his doctrin: but they met together for no other end, but to eclipse and
darken the sunne, then when the beames thereof did most shine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Then gathered the high Priests and the Pharisees a
Councell.</hi> After that the diuell had tempted our Sauiour, finding him
somewhat sharpe and sower towards him, Saint <hi>Luke</hi> saith, <hi>Reliquit
eum diabolus ad tempus, The diuell gaue him ouer for that bout,</hi> and would
haue no more to doe with him for the present: but left him then of purpose,
waiting for a better season and opportunitie, <hi>Vsque ad tempus, For a time.
Euthymius</hi> askes, for how long? And his answer is, Till that the Priests
and the Pharisees had called a Councell. This was the diuells plot, though they
did not then thinke so when they met in Councell. And yet they were no soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
sat, but that Sacrilegious decree went foorth from amongst them, To put him to
death.</p>
            <p>Some man perhaps will aske me, How the diuell could hope to get
the greater victorie of our Sauiour Christ by this meanes, working the same
more by the high Priests and the Pharisees, than by himselfe?</p>
            <p>First of all I answer thereunto, One that serues on horsebacke is
imagined to be of greater force and power than he that serues on foot. And as a
certain glosse hath it, which <hi>Thomas</hi> alleageth, The wicked are the
diuells horses; and being horsed vpon the high Priests and the Pharisees, it is
not much, that hee should presume to take away our Sauiours life. If the high
Priests and the Pharisees had been horsed vpon the diuells backe, the danger
had not beene so great: But when the diuell shall ride vpon high Priests and
Iudges, &amp;c. it is a fearfull thing.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith, That albeit the diuell be
the Author of all mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe, yet hath he sent forth many learned and nimble
witted schollers which haue wonderfully aduanced his cause; suting with that of
the Apostle, who calls the wicked, <hi>Inuentores malorum, Inuenters of
euill.</hi> The diuell was the first Inuenter therof, but afterwards there were
some men that discouered much more malice. <hi>Magellanes</hi> was the first
that passed the Streights, but afterwards others went so farre beyond him, that
he is cast behind.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the diuell by himselfe alone, can commonly doe little,
vnlesse wee serue and supply him with materials.<note place="margin">Sathan can
  do little with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out vs.</note> 
               <hi>Comestor</hi> reports it to be a tradition
amongst the Rabbines, that in the making of the golden Calfe, the diuell
performed two Offices; the one of a Smith, the other of a Mettall-founder: but,
that the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes furnished him with Materialls, they found the stuffe, for
the women (who commonly are most superstitious, and by consequence fittest to
be the diuells in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments) furnished him with their eare-rings, bracelets,
&amp; iewels of gold. Here now in like maner the diuel did imploy his best
industry and diligence; he was the cause ofthis Consultation, and the plotter
of this Councell: but the high Priests and the Pharisees were they that
ministred the materials, helping him with their voices.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="586" facs="tcp:22083:313"/>
               <hi>They called a Councell.</hi> Peace is
the fruit of Grace. <hi>The fruits of the Spirit, are Loue,</hi>

                  <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.</note> 
               <hi>Ioy, and Peace.</hi> And for that
sinners liue aloofe off from Loue and Ioy, they must likewise of force liue
farre from Peace. How can a troubled sea enioy a Calme? <hi>But the wicked are
a troubled Sea.</hi> In a word, <hi>There is no peace to the

               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Esay</hi> 67.</note> But how comes it now
to passe, That they are at that peace and vnitie, that they ioyne together and
gather a Councell against our Sauiour Christ, with so vnanimous a consent, that
there is not a voyce wanting, but run all ioyntly for his death?</p>
            <p>First of all I answer thereunto, That the wicked vsually enioy a
kind of league and alliance, and confederat with a ioynt consent for their owne
priuat profit, and anothers hurt. But they neuer inioy any peace, So saith
Saint <hi>Augustine, Eos copulat non amor, sed malitia, It is not loue, but
malice that thus linkes them together.</hi> They confederat themselues, not
that they loue, but that they hate that which they ought to loue; wanting not
so much vnderstanding, as will. <hi>Philon</hi> compares them to Reapers, who
fall a singing but haue no other agreement in their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke, but that they
disagree alike. He compares them likewise to the colds and heats of a quartane
Ague, which being a perpetuall distemper, yet both iumpe and meete at such an
instant, and such an houre. <hi>Viam pacis non cognouerunt</hi> (saith
<hi>Dauid,</hi>) <hi>They haue not knowne the way of Peace</hi>; But to shed
innocent blood, their feet are very swift. <hi>Iob</hi> thus painteth forth the
mysticall body of the diuell, The Maiestie of his Scales,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iob</hi> 41.</note> is like strong shields, and are sure
sealed; one is so set to another that no wind can come between them: one is so
ioyned to another that they sticke together and cannot be sundred. The wicked
(saith <hi>Lyra</hi>) are the flesh of this body, and are like shields, and as
armes made in the manner of scales, <hi>Se praementibus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The wicked haue a league, no loue.</note> 
               <hi>One pressing vpon
another:</hi> A shield vpon a shield, and a scale vpon a scale, so close knit
and ioyned together, that the ayre cannot get in betweene them, Considering on
the one side their ill neighbourhood, and on the other, their strict league and
amitie. <hi>Dauid</hi> askes the question, <hi>Why doe the Heathen rage, the
Kings of the earth band themselues, and the Princes assemble together against
the Lord, and against his Christ?</hi> Is there any man that knowes the cause
of this discor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding concord, of this accursed combination? That <hi>Esau</hi>
should rise vp against <hi>Iacob, Ismael</hi> against <hi>Isaac, Cain</hi>
against <hi>Abel,</hi> the brethren against <hi>Ioseph, Iezabel</hi> against
<hi>Naboth,</hi> the two old Leachers of Babylon against <hi>Susanna</hi>; it
is not much to suffer one enimie that persecutes me, hauing many friends to
protect mee. But that the Gentile, the Iew, the King, the Vassall, the Clergie,
and the Laytie, should all cry out against our Sauiour Christ, this requires a
<hi>Quare?</hi> Why they should doe it? The reason is, because euery one of the
Saints in particular, and all in generall, were persecuted for his sake, and
Christ for his owne, <hi>Vnum contra vnum,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The world
  consisteth of nothing but opposition.</note> is the worlds Motto. God (saith
<hi>Salomon</hi>) created all things in an opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Omnia secundum
litem fiunt</hi> (saith <hi>Heraclytus.</hi>) And that great Orator and Poet
Laureat, <hi>Petrarke,</hi> telleth vs, <hi>Sine lite, atque offensione, nil
genuit natura parens, That Nature, who is the mother of all things, and common
parent of this great vniuerse, brought forth nothing into the world without
strife and contention.</hi> This is it that makes the holy man to set himselfe
against the prophane; and the prophane against the holy. And so in the rest.
And because euery one of Gods Saints, though they were seasoned with all the
other vertues, yet were they more particularly poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at for some one
especiall vertue. And to this purpose is that vsuall song in the Church;
<hi>Non est inuentus similis illi, There is none like vnto him.</hi> But our
Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Christ was that vniuersall glasse, where in all the vertues were to be
seene in their most perfect and supremest degree. For this cause, the enuie of
<hi>Cain</hi> wageth <pb n="587" facs="tcp:22083:313"/> war against those fauours God did
to <hi>Abel</hi>; the little honestie of <hi>Iosephs</hi> brethren, and his
masters wife, against his great both honestie and goodnesse; the proud and
harsh nature of <hi>Esau</hi> against the meeke and sweet disposition of
<hi>Iacob:</hi> But against our Sauiour Christ, all the wicked in generall haue
combined themselues; <hi>Come let vs oppose our selues against the iust,
because he crosseth our actions, and liketh not of that we doe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>They called a Councell.</hi> There is not any one thing more
precious, or more necessary than a Councell. There is not that man (saith Saint
<hi>Chrysostom</hi>) be he the wisest man in the world, but in fine is a man,
and hath need of Counsell: on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it may be said of God, Who was euer his
Counseller, or was able to aduise him? What saith Saint <hi>Augustine? Ego
senex &amp; Episcopus, paratus sum à puero do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceri, I, though an old

so much regarding his calling, as his Counsell; his person, as the proiect. The
Counsell which <hi>Ioseph</hi> gaue to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> imported him more than
if hee had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>richt him with much treasure: For treasure decreaseth through

That he went vp to Ierusalem, and communicated with them of the Gospell which
he had preached among the Gentiles: and presently ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth a reason thereof in
the words following, <hi>Least by any meanes I should runne, or had runne in

to aduise with his Counsell, but suffer himselfe to be carryed away with his

slownesse, that they had not made an end of him no sooner. There are many
sinners, who no longer than they are plotting villany, or committing one sinne
or other, thinke themselues idle fellowes, and loytering companions: as the
Iust, who are alwayes hungring &amp; thirsting after righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, so the

in sinning, and thinke themselues idle when they are not ill occupied. Foure or
fiue deuout persons come from a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and say one to another as they walke
homeward, Trust mee (my Masters) it is high time that we should begin to amend
our liues, and that so many truths that the Preacher hath deliuered vnto vs,
should bring forth some good fruit in vs. Another as hungrie after sinne, as
these after goodnesse, comes to his fellow, puls him by the cloake, drawes him
out of the Church, &amp; sayes vnto him, What a Deuil makest thou at a sermon?
come let vs goe to such an Ordinarie, there we shall be sure to haue the doore
open, and some good fellowes or other to game withall and spend the time. Your
Curtezans they steale out by couples, saying to each other, What should we do
here? we mispend our time, for my part I shal lose by the bargaine; no longer
sinne, no longer gaine, let vs hie vs home there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, one customer or other

to the other, <hi>Que se haze compadre? How goes the world Gossip? No nada por

drawne this punishment vpon vs</hi>: And the reason of it grows from this, that
no longer than they are ministring of purges and syrrops, they thinke their
time lost. So is it with a sinner that hungers after sin; there are some men
which euerie night get them to bed without any more adoo, laden with mortall
sins by the dozens, and yet think themselues to be Saints: But being thus
heauily laden, darest thou presume to lay thee down to sleep? take heed lest
they presse thee too hard, &amp; that thou accompaniest thy sleep with death. O
good ghostly father (say these men) I know not what this heauinesse of sins
meane, that you talk of, I find no such matter, I thanke God I sleepe soundly,
I am not troubled with dreames, but take my rest as quietly as any man in the
world. Say you so my masters, you shal giue me leaue not to beleeue you; for
albeit by long custome of sinning, you do not feele the weight of this tower,
nor the heigth of this mountain that you beare vpon your backs, notwithstanding
all this, you shall dream (as the Prophet saith) fearefull dreames: and howbeit
wee are not to giue credit to euerie idle dreame, yet may yee take these for

spirituall, they lost both.</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience teacheth vs, That Faith and
Religion conserue Kingdomes. Which Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> prooueth vnto vs

<hi>Achior</hi> the Ammonite notified as much to <hi>Holofernes</hi> at the
siege of Bethulia.</p>
            <p>And here we may take vp a iust complaint against your counterfeit
Christians, your dissembling Polititians, and their damnable Positions, who
loosing in part the name of Christians and of Catholikes, beare themselues high
vpon the name of Polititians and Statesmen, liuing wondrous well contented
therewith; who are a kind of cattle, that doe so highly prize their Courtly
carriage, their curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous behauiour and faire demeanor, that they seeke to
reduce the cause of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and Faith, to ciuilitie and curtesie; iudging
all the rest meere rusticitie and clownishnesse: alledging in their defence,
That many things must yeeld and giue way to the times; as also to dissemble
with the times. And that for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like peace, which ought aboue all things
to be esteemed, they affirme, That war ought not to bee waged for matter of
difference in Religion, as well because it cannot be rooted out ofmens brests;
as also, because the obligation of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not so precise a thing, that we
should for the same aduenture and hazard ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our goods, our persons, or the
peace of a State. They say, That that which doth most of all concerne a
Statesman, is aboue all things to haue an eye to the good of his Country, and
the profit and benefit of the people therein; but by no meanes to enter into a
Warre, nor to draw too much enuie vpon them for cause of Religion, leauing that
care to Clergie-men, or to Preachers, or to God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, Who, if the Church
shall receiue any iniurie by the new broached opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, is able of himselfe to
reuenge his owne qua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rell. In a
word, There is not that meere Polititian or Statesman, that is not desirous to
sleepe in a whole skin, and to looke well enough to himselfe for one, without
thrusting himselfe into quarrels and contentions for points of Religion. Whence
it comes to passe, that they forsake the <hi>Patrocinium</hi> and protection of
the Church, and vpon foule termes put the Catholike faith into their enemies
fingers.</p>
            <p>He that doth not preferre the cause of Religion before all things
else what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer, doth not deserue the name of a Christian; for Faith, Diuine
Worship, and Religion, difference a Christian from a Gentile: Hee then that
shall sleight the same, and make light account of it, how shall he enioy this
name? If vnto great sinners, our Sauiour saith, <hi>Nescio vos, I know yee
not</hi>; though they confesse and esteeme of faith, What will he say vnto
Polititians and Statesmen? The gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <pb n="594" facs="tcp:22083:317"/> voice of this
Sect, is, Let vs first regard our temporall meanes, be it priuat or publike;
for religion and truth, so no hurt thereby come vnto vs, let it shift for it
selfe, what is it to vs what hazzard it runnes? <hi>Summa peruersio</hi> (saith
Saint <hi>Augustine</hi>) <hi>frui vtendis, &amp; vti fruendis.</hi> Your
Polititians set vp their rest and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in enioying temporall goods, and in
making vse of spirituall goods. <hi>Pilat</hi> was a Polititian, for the Iewes
alledging vnto him, <hi>If thou let this man loose, thou art not Caesars
friend</hi>; he condemned our Sauiour Christ to death, preferring
<hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sars</hi> friendship before Christs life. <hi>Ieroboam</hi> was a
Polititian, who made two cal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

the subiects of his kingdome, that they might not go vp to Ierusalem. Those
were Polititians, which in Saint <hi>Augustines</hi> time inforced him to write
those his bookes <hi>de Ciuit. Dei,</hi> alledging, That they had many bad
yeares, misfortunes, and disasters for professing the Law of Christ. Those were
Polititians, That k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

would not confesse him openly before men, <hi>Least they should be thrust out
of the Synagogue. Ioseph</hi> of Arimathea, and <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> were
Polititians, for that they sought after our Sauiour Christ by night, for feare
of the Iewes. Polititians are those, of whom <hi>Ieremias</hi> said, <hi>Since

that he should lineally descend from <hi>Abel,</hi> and that hee should be
thrust out and disgraced, resolued to remooue that blocke that stood in his

which applie themselues wholly to their priuat profit. King <hi>Don Alonso</hi>

flourished, he would haue built a Temple before the Capitoll, where the

What <hi>Moses,</hi> art thou now turned coward? What had it been to thee to

thy people? That was a particular good, this a common; and a Gouernor ought
mainly and especially to haue an eye vnto that. Those Cowes which carried the

wicked persons, and liues therein with God and a good conscience, presently
they say, <hi>Que sabe poco,</hi> That he is a man of no vnderstanding, and

<hi>It is expedient for vs, that one man die for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, rather than that
the whole Nation should perish.</hi> At that verie instant when the High-Priest
was to pronounce this decree, the Holy-Ghost and the Deuil moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him therunto
both at once; the one directed his heart, the other his tongue: but in
<hi>Caiphas</hi> his purpose and intention, it was the wickedest Decree, and
the most sacrilegious determination that was euer deliuered in the World. God
could not bee well pleased with <hi>Caiphas</hi> for desiring the death of the
Innocent; nor yet displeased with his death, for that it was decreed in the
sacred Councel of the blessed Trinitie, That one should die for the sinnes of
the people. But in God and <hi>Caiphas</hi> the ends were diuerse; this out of
malice to our Sauiour; that out of loue to Mankind. Nor is it inconuenient,
that one and the selfesame proposition should haue a different sence and
meaning. <hi>Destroy this Temple, and I will build it vp againe in three
dayes</hi>: The Pharisees vnderstood this of the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall Temple, but our
Sauiour Christ, of the Temple of his bodie. <hi>That which thou doost, due
quickely</hi>: Our Sauiour Christ spake this of <hi>Iudas</hi> his treating to
sell him, but his Disciples vnderstood him as concerning the preparation of the
Passeouer. And so in this place, <hi>It is fit that this man should die,</hi>
(saith <hi>Caiphas</hi>) <hi>that we may not become captiues to Rome</hi>: and
Heauen saith, It is fit that hee should die, because the whole World should not
perish. The persecution and death of a Martyr turnes to the Martyrs good, but

the death of Christ, for our good; but the world could not light on a worse
meanes than the death of our Sauiour Christ, for it's owne ill.

            <p>
               <hi>Origen</hi> hath obserued, That <hi>Caiphas</hi> prophesied,
but that he was no Prophet.</p>
            <p>First, Because one action of a Prophet doth not make the habit or
denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Prophet.</p>
            <p>Secondly, because he did not attaine vnto the sence and meaning of
the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-Ghost, the knowledge whereof in point of prophesie is necessarie.</p>
            <p>S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith, That <hi>Caiphas</hi> pretended one
thing, &amp; vttered another, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that he sin'd in the sentence
which he pronounced, because hisintent was bad &amp; vniust; as it was with
<hi>Balaam,</hi> who as he was a Prophet could not curse the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of
Israell, but as they were particular persons, they did sinne and erre: so that
the Holy-Ghost seruing himselfe with the tongue of <hi>Caiphas,</hi> as the
instrument, the High-Priest did but determine that which the Holy-Ghost had
before decreed.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The same words out of diuers mouths may be

and consider the good and the ill of an intention, since that one and the selfe
same words are so good and so ill. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> pondereth vpon
those words of Saint <hi>Paul, Qui filio proprio suo non pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>percit, sed pro
nobis omnibus tradidit illum, Who spared not his owne sonne, but gaue him for
vs all to death.</hi> This word <hi>Tradidit,</hi> is verified both of the

<hi>Pilat, Tradidit voluntati eorum, He deliuered him vp to their will.</hi>
The deliuering of him vp, was all one and the same: but the Father and the
Sonne did this out of their mercy and loue to the world; but <hi>Iudas</hi> and
<hi>Pilat,</hi> out of hatred, treason,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi>
  26.</note> and iniustice. Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith, That that murmuring
about the oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment [<hi>Vt quid perditio ista vnguenti facta est? What needed
this waste?</hi>] was vttered by <hi>Iudas,</hi> and the Disciples, in one and
the same words: But in them they procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded out of a good mind; but in
<hi>Iudas,</hi> out of auarice: for the Disciples had there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a respect to the
poore; For this oyntment (muttered they) might haue beene sold for much, and
beene giuen to the poore. But <hi>Iudas</hi> out of the profit that he might
haue made thereby vnto himselfe, by filching some of it away, if he had come to
the fingring of it. Saint <hi>Hilary</hi> expounding that saying of our Sauiour
Christ, <hi>Pater maior me est, My Father is greater than I,</hi> saith, That
it being heard from <hi>Arrius</hi> his mouth,<note place="margin">

  19.</note> it sauoured like gall; but from our Sauiours mouth, like hony. In
Corinth, certaine Exorcists, sonnes of the Prince of the Priests, would take
vpon them to cast out an euill spirit, <hi>Pessimum,</hi> the Text stiles him.
Who did demand of them, Who gaue you licence to execute this Office? <hi>Vos
au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem qui estis? What are ye?</hi> Iesus I acknowledge, and <hi>Paul</hi> I
know, but who are ye? And the man in whom the euill spirit was, ranne on them,
and preuailed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, so that they fled out of that house naked and
wounded. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did cast out diuels in the name of the Lord Iesus
Christ, and these men likewise did vse the name of the Lord Iesus Christ: How
comes it then to passe, that the successe was so contrary? I answer, The
intention was different. Their words were the same, but not their intent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is expedient for vs that one man dye.</hi> The naturall
consideration of this place, is the conueniencie of Christs death: It was

Wherof I haue treated at large elswhere.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This spake he not of himselfe.</hi> Saint <hi>Augustine, Hoc

mouth, but not his heart.</hi> Whence Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> 
               <pb n="597" facs="tcp:22083:319"/> doth inferre, how impertinently the Heretikes doe
impugne the liues of the Priests, with an intent and purpose to ouerthrow the
force and power of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall dignities, and their sacred command and
authoritie. <hi>Moses</hi> his doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, did not hinder the gushing of the

Of Treacle, the Physitians say, That it hath a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle touch of poyson in it,
and it being it's naturall condition and propertie to flye to the heart, though
it be hurtfull one way, yet it carryes it's remedy with it. So in like maner,
the holy Ghost made vse of <hi>Caiphas</hi> his tongue, as the instrument of
letting forth that diuine blood, whose shedding was our saluation. Of a leaud
wicked fellow <hi>Plutarch</hi> reporteth, That he vttered a very graue
sentence, and that <hi>Lacedamonia</hi> gaue order, that it should be ascribed
to another, Answering to our <hi>à semetipso non dixit.</hi> This was
not a bird of his hatching. <hi>Iob</hi> seemeth to bee somewhat mooued and
offended, That God should ayde the wicked in their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse, <hi>Thinkest

               <hi>and to fauour the
Councell of the wicked?</hi> But the diuine prouidence is wont to make vse of
the Councels of Tyrants, and such as are enemies thereunto, but does ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
assist and helpe them forward. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> telleth vs, That some did
preach our Sauiour Christ through enuie, others for opposition sake, and by way
of contention; and saith withall, <hi>In hoc gaudeo, &amp; gaudebo, In this I
doe and shall reioyce.</hi> And Christs Disciples aduising him, that some did
cast forth diuells in his name, made them this answer, <hi>Nolite prohibere,
Forbid them not,</hi> For the indignitie and vnworthinesse in the person of the
Minister, doth not destroy the grace of his function and dignitie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This spake he not of himselfe.</hi> From so bad a man could
not come so deepe a Mysterie, onely God could put this so rare a conceit into

            <p>
               <hi>Iesus therefore walked no more openly among the Iewes.</hi>
Seeing death now neere at hand, he withdrew himselfe; reading a Lecture therein

We may not die twice, for to amend in our second death, the errors of our
former life. There is no reuersing of iudgement, no appealing from this Iudge
to that, or from one Court to another. That which wil concerne and import thee
most, is, That thou condemne thy selfe, before God condemne thee; and that thou
kill sinne in thee, before God kill thee in thy sin. This is the onely way to
secure danger, and to kill death. Many sit vp so long at play, that at last
they are faine to goe to bed darkling. This our liuing in the world, is a kind

               <hi>Frater
fui Draconum,</hi> saith <hi>Iob, I am a brother to the Dragons, and a
companion to the Ostriches. Inter Scorpiones habitaui</hi> (saith
<hi>Ezechiel</hi>) <hi>I dwelt among Scorpions.</hi> Albeit by their habit and
shape they seeme to be men, they are indeed no better than Dragons and
Scorpions: and therefore of the two, it is the lesser euill to liue amongst
these known wild beasts, than such beastly minded men. Your Wolfes that are
clad in sheepes cloathing, our Sauiour markes out to be the vtmost of euill. S.
<hi>Ambrose</hi> treating of the sorrow which the stones shewed at our Sauiours
death, and that they were so sensible thereof that they did split in sunder,
saith, That our Sauiour found more pitty in those stones, than in his peoples
brests.</p>
            <p>Whence by the way it is to be noted, That when those that gouerne
and sit at the helme are generally naught and wicked, it is needfull then for
vs to flye vnto the wildernesse: for it is better to liue with Dragons and
Scorpions than with them. When there is an earthquake in the Citie, all hast
out of it and get them into the fields. <hi>All the foundations of the earth
shall be shaken</hi>; What doe ye stay for then, Why do ye stand looking and
gazing one on another as if you had nothing to doe, when destruction is so
neere at hand? In a word, <hi>Daniel</hi> is cast into the Lyons Den, and the
same is sealed with the Kings owne Signet, not for any hurt that he had done
the Lyons, nor for any harme that hee had done his companions and
play-fellowes, but throwne in thither by the malice of the Princes of the
people, and the Iudges of the land. O Lord deliuer vs from the oppression of
powerfull Princes, and the vnconscionable dealing of corrupt Iudges.</p>
            <p>That there should be but one bad Gouernour, or but one bad Iudge,
it is ill: because such a one is the fountaine whereof all doe drinke. <hi>Si

should be two such bad mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in a Common-wealth, is a great deale worse. Of
those two naughty Iudges that wronged <hi>Susanna,</hi> God said, <hi>Et
egressa est iniquitas à Babylone</hi>: Your briberies, your thefts, and
your adulteries tooke life from them, in whom they should haue dyed. But when
the whole Bench of Iudges shall be bad, get thee gone into the desart, flye to
the wildernes: for it is too great a boldnes then, not to be as others are. He
that hath a mangie hand, couers it with a cloth, binds it vp close, and
dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembles the matter as much as he can; but if he see other men in the same
case as himselfe is in, he looseth all shame. The first day that a man enters
into the Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, or some place of gouernment, &amp;c. He saith, <hi>Dominus

first and chiefest is, a resolution taken by the Priests to put
<hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi> to death. As if God could not raise him from a violent death,
who had raised him from a naturall death. They thought with themselues, that
<hi>Lazarus</hi> holding his life by miracle, it would be an addition of credit
and reputation to our Sauiour. And, as to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his life, they had no
other reason but his many Miracles, so did they like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise seeke to cut off
<hi>Lazarus,</hi> thinking it very vnfit, that he should be a witnesse to make
good the greatest Miracle that euer our Saiuour wrought, and that by his life
and words, he should notifie Christs Diuinitie to the Iewes and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles that
came to visit him.</p>

               <note place="margin">God the

gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and dignities of the world, is a notorious lye; though when he
tempteth any, he would seeme to make it haue some appearance of truth. Hee said
vnto our Sauiour Christ, <hi>All this will I giue thee,</hi> Representing vnto
him a briefe Cosmographie of all the whole world; Insinuating, That hee was
Lord of all, and had the bestowing of all. The like speech he vsed, when being
askt of God, from whence he came, he answered, <hi>I am come from compassing
the earth,</hi> I haue rounded my Heritage. And doubtlesse, Hee that shall
narrowly looke into those who command and rule the greater part of the world,
will (I feare me) beleeue, that the diuell did put the same into their hands:
but the truth is, That God is the sole Lord of all. S. <hi>Iohn</hi> stiles him
in his <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, and paints him
foorth with many Crownes vpon his head, <hi>And on his head were many
Crownes,</hi>

hath the donation of Scepters and Crownes. <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> stiled himselfe
the great King, and had appertaining to his Empire 127 Prouinces.
<hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> was a mighty Prince: but these and all that euer were,

               <hi>when he separated the sonnes of Adam, he appointed the borders
of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, according to the number of the children of Israel.</hi> The
Statue of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> which signified the Empires of the earth,
was but a Statue in a dreame, and so vanished like a dreame. The Kings and
Emperors of the earth, some dye, others are borne, are heere to day and gone to
morrow, <hi>Hodie est rex, &amp; cras morietur.</hi> But Gods Empire endureth
for euer. <hi>Pliny</hi> saith, That the election of <hi>Traiane</hi> may be a
sufficient argument to prooue, That God setteth vp Kings, not onely among
Christians, but the Gentiles; Suting with that of <hi>Homer, Ex Ioue,
Reges.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This truth being supposed, some man may aske me, How comes it then
to passe, that God places in that Citie where his name is called vpon, where he
hath his house and his Altar, these high Priests, who after they had decreed
the death of Christ, did treat of killing <hi>Lazarus?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which difficultie is the more augmented, because for the most
part, the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours of this world are naughtie men; as was to be seene in the
Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. <hi>Thales Milesius,</hi> the prime wise man of Greece, being

But where there is a good Gouernour, that Common-wealth he fauoureth.
<hi>Phocas</hi> was a most cruell Emperour of Constantinople; whereupon a holy
Monke in a corner of his Cell, thus complaineth vnto God, <hi>Cur fecisti eum
Imperatorem? Why didst thou make him Emperour?</hi> Who had no sooner made his
mone, but he heard a voyce from heauen, saying, <hi>Non inueni peiorem, I could
not finde a worse.</hi> In Thebes, there was a great Hypocrite, which was euen
ready to die out of the great desire he had to be a Bishop; who had scarce
obtained that dignitie, but that he fell a spoyling the Common-wealth: but an
Angell told him, That hee was not made Bishop because he deserued to be a

vniuersis regnis terrae propter Manassem, fili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um Ezechiae. Anastasius</hi>
reades it, <hi>Per Manassem.</hi> For, as a good King is a great cause, why God
with a gracious eye doth looke vpon his people; so a bad king is the meanes
that he vseth for the punishing of them. Saint <hi>Gregorie,</hi> the
Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishopricke of Milan being void, wrot to the Clergie, that they would
obliege God by prayer and by fasting, to giue them a good Pastor. For, as God
is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with his people, so he giues them Prelats accordingly. The Queen of
Sheba considering the wisedome of <hi>Salomon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">3.
  <hi>Reg.</hi> 10.</note> said, That nothing did more manifest Gods loue towards
his people of Israel, and the desire of their perpetuitie, than in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
giuen them so wise a Gouernour. And <hi>Iosephus</hi> reporteth, That he being
but twelue yeares of age when he first began to gouerne, the people listening
to that sentence which he gaue at his first sitting in iudgement, touching the
two women that contested about their child, <hi>Let the infant be cut in
twaine</hi>; Many laughed at it, deeming it to be a childish sentence; but
afterwards wisely weighing the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet course that hee had taken in
iustifying the truth, without any further proofes or testimonies, they then
cryed out, <hi>De coelo elapsus, This King is sent vs downe from heauen.</hi>
And albeit the heauens, planets, and starres, are to mans see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming farre off;
yet in regard of those influences which they cause in inferiour bodies, they
are neere at hand. And albeit they are incorruptible, yet doe they affoord
great fauours to corruptible things. If heauen behold vs with a propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous 
<pb n="601" facs="tcp:22083:321"/> eye, and the planets with prosperous aspects, the earth
doth enioy much fruitfulnesse and abundance. But contrariwise, our soules are
not subiect to those materiall heauens; but to those heauens of our Prelats,
and Gouernours. Behold, <hi>I create a new heauen, and a new earth.</hi> This
may bee vnderstood of the Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Estate, and the Secular; of
Superiours and Inferiours. When these heauens affoord a prosperous light, the
earth is beautifull, pleasant, plentifull, and fertile. And so on the contrary,
<hi>Ieremie</hi> saith, <hi>I beheld the earth, and loe it was emptie, I
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the heauens, and could see no light in them.</hi> What light then could
there bee in Ierusalem, when as <hi>Annas</hi> and <hi>Cayphas</hi> were the
high Priests?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The high Priests consulted, that they might put Lazarus to
death.</hi> Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, That this deuise and drift of
theirs was deriued from the diuell, and from hell. There are some thoughts that
are ingendred and bred in our flesh, as the rust in the yron, the rottennes in
the wood, the moth in the cloth, and the worme and mytes in butter and in
cheese. Our flesh is a durtie puddle, which sends forth such foule and thicke
vapors from it, that if you doe not make great hast to expell and driue them
thence, they will quickly cloud and darken the light of the vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. It
is sicke of the kitchin, the gutter, whitherall the dust and sluttishnesse of
the sences, gathers and meetes together to make such a stinke and stoppage,
that the water of Gods grace can hardly get through, and cleanse the same; it
is a most grieuous and heauie burthen, not onely because it is so painefull and
intollerable, but also because it is ineuitable. All the plagues of Aegypt were
remooued by <hi>Moses</hi> his prayer, saue onely the flyes: And these are
those our thoughts and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations, being inexcusable, as importunate and
troublesome, which are ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred in this our body of flesh. Euery one beares
about him his particular af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and the Idol which his heart adoreth; This
man his pleasures, that man his profit; one, his honour, another his grace and
fauour with his king; some, their great and strong Alliance; others, their
daintie and delicious fare. And euerie one of these, is like vnto the beast
that is tyed to his racke and manger, whereon his thoughts doe continually
feede. This is that same, <hi>Trahit sua quemque voluptas, Euery man is wedded
to some one kinde of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, or other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Schoolemen set downe two sorts of thoughts.</p>
            <p>The one, which flesh and blood produceth.</p>
            <p>The other, which are sowne in vs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cogitatio innata,</hi> And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cogitatio, ab alio lata.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That which is bred in vs. And that which is otherwise brought
vnto vs.</hi> Some hearbes grow vp in the earth ofthemselues; others are sown:
So some thoughts haue their breeding in mans brest, others are sowne there; and
it must of force follow, that they are sowne eyther by the diuell, or by God.
Of those of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Let no temptation take
hold on you, but that which is humane.</hi> That the verie thought of some
extraordinarie beautie should trouble and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet thee, the thought of thy
Princes fauour, of Signiorie, or any other tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall good, this is a humane
temptation; but the killing of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and the selling and betraying
of our Sauiour Christ, is a diuellish temptation. And therefore Saint
<hi>Iohn</hi> saith, <hi>That the diuell had put it into Iudas his heart,</hi>
that it was hee that had sowne this bad seed there, and thrust this thought
into him. But whether or no, this thought be of the flesh or of the diuell;
sure I am, that it is the generall doctrine of the Saints, That we should not
nourish any euil thought, nor let it like a bottome of yarne, waxe warme in our
hand. <hi>Esay</hi> complaineth of <pb n="602" facs="tcp:22083:322"/> his people, That they
conceiued mischiefe, and brought foorth iniquitie; that they hatched cockatrice
egges, and woue the spiders web; that he that eateth of their egges dyeth, and
all that which is trod vpon, breaketh out into a serpent. As out of an Aspick's
egge (saith <hi>Aristotle</hi>) being kept warme and cherished, is hatcht the
Basiliske; so from our thoughts, taking warmth from the heat of consent, is
bred the Basiliske of sin. This is for the sheepe to breed vp the wolfe, or to
giue sucke to that toad which shall venome thy brest and work thy death. The
Greeke Text saith, <hi>Consultauerunt consilio,</hi> They did lay their heads
toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they sat in Councell, they did not onely thinke vpon, but consent to
the greatest malice and wickednesse, which euer the diuell or hell could
imagine, <hi>Vt Lazarum interficerent, To kill Lazarus.</hi> This is the end of
our thoughts, when they are not cut off in time; Sinne is so great an Vsurer,
that it goes dayly gayning more and more ground vpon mans brest, till it hath
brought it to a desperate estate. <hi>They were growne to that desperation,
that they said vnto filthinesse, I am thy ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant.</hi> Saint <hi>Ierome</hi>
saith, That as the couetous thirst after money; so doe these af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
dishonestie. They are like those that goe downe into a deepe well; they knit
rope to rope, and one sinne to another. <hi>Why dyed I not in the birth? Or why
dyed I not when I came out of the wombe? Why did the knees preuent me? And why
did I sucke the brests?</hi> Wherein the Prophet painteth foorth vnto vs the
foure estates of a child.</p>
            <p>The first in the wombe.</p>
            <p>The second, when it is borne.</p>

            <p>The fourth, when they giue it the teat.</p>
            <p>S. <hi>Gregorie</hi> doth applie these foure, to the foure estates
of sinne.</p>
            <p>The first, in the thought which conceiues it.</p>
            <p>The second, in the ill which bringeth it forth.</p>
            <p>The third, when we put it on like a garment.</p>
            <p>The fourth, when we nourish and maintaine it.</p>
            <p>Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> painteth foorth these foure estates, in
these foure dead folkes:</p>
            <p>In the daughter of the Archisinagoguian, who stirred not from
home.</p>
            <p>In the sonne of the widow of Naim. who was accompanied to his
graue.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Lazarus,</hi> who lay foure dayes dead.</p>
            <p>And in him, whom our Sauiour Christ did not raise vp at al;
saying, <hi>Let the dead bury the dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The Iewes were murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of all Gods
  Saints.</note>
               <hi>They consulted to put Lazarus to death.</hi> Our Sauiours
death was already con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded on, and now this cruel people treated of making
away <hi>Lazarus.</hi> Of whom our Sauiour Christ said, <hi>Vt descendat super
vos omnis sanguis iustus à sanguine Abel, ad sanguinem Zachariae,
&amp;c.</hi> It is no maruell that they sought to kill <hi>Lazarus</hi>: for in
him was sum'd vp all the blood of the iust that had beene shed in the world.
And the reason that makes this to seeme so, is, because all the iust that dyed
in the world since <hi>Abel,</hi> were a Type and figure of Christ: And if they
did die, it was to giue testimonie of his death; and had it not beene for our
Sauiour Christs death, his had not preceedd. And for that the life of the iust
was a shadow of that of our Sauiour Christ; in taking away his life, in whom
all the liues of the world were contained, they were guiltie of all the rest,
and as much as lay in them, were the Homicides of the whole world. And if he
that carryes but one mans death about him, findes no place of safetie vpon
earth, What rest shall he find, that hath so many deaths crying vpon his
conscience?</p>

               <pb n="603" facs="tcp:22083:322"/>Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> treating of the
sinne of <hi>Cain,</hi> saith, That it was greater than that of <hi>Adam.</hi>
For, besides his loosing in the turning of a hand, the greatest Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire that
euer the world had; we cannot imagine any sinne to be greater than the barring
of all mankind from heauen, the depriuing him of grace, and of the friendship
of God: yet notwithstanding, this seemeth to be the greater, and hee proueth it
by the sentence that was giuen vpon the one sin &amp; the other. God
sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencing <hi>Adam,</hi> said, <hi>Cursed is the earth for thy sake,
&amp;c.</hi> The blow of the curse was to fall vpon <hi>Adam</hi>; and as the
father which makes shew to throw the candlestick at his sons head, but flings
it against the next wall; so God sayes, <hi>Cursed is the earth for thy
sake.</hi> But with the Serpent, and with <hi>Cain,</hi> he proceeded
otherwise. To the Serpent he said, <hi>Thou art cursed aboue all cattle, and
aboue euery beast of the field, vpon thy belly shalt thou goe, and dust shalt
thou eate all the dayes of thy life.</hi> To <hi>Cain, Thou art cursed from the
earth, which hath opened her mouth, to receiue thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers blood from thine
hand, it shall not henceforth yeeld vnto thee her strength, &amp;c.</hi> He did
not forbid him to tread vpon the earth, but he forbad him to enioy the fruits
thereof, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>The voyce of thy brothers blood cryeth vnto me from
the earth.</hi> Saint <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose</hi> saith, That he heard the voyce of
<hi>Abel</hi>; for with God, the dead speake as well as the liuing. The Hebrew
hath it, The voyce of bloods; putting it in the plurall number (as
<hi>Lyra</hi> hath noted it:) For hee had shed so many bloods as <hi>Abel</hi>
might haue had children. For, albeit they had neither being nor life in
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, yet they might in their cause and beginning: <hi>It cryes to mee
from the earth.</hi> Not from his body, for though thy brother should haue
forgiuen thee, yet the earth would not pardon thee, to see it selfe violated by
a Traytor. And if God would haue but giuen way thereunto, a thousand mouths
would haue opened to swallow thee vp aliue; but being he would not consent
thereunto, it goes cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king those seedes which might haue serued thee for thy
sustenance and delight; and shaking thee off from thence like a banished man,
this Writ is gone out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst thee, <hi>A vagabond and runnagate shalt thou be
vpon the earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, All the superiour and inferiour creatures were to be his
persecutors and his tormentors; the heauens with thunder and lightning; the
Angels with fearfull apparitions; the beasts of the woods, and men, shunning
his company; and God himselfe chastising him with a continuall trembling. But
some wil say, How could God persecute him, since he published a Proclamation,
That whosoeuer should kill <hi>Cain,</hi> should be punished seuen-fold,
<hi>Sextuplum punietur:</hi> The Seuentie Interpreters render it, <hi>Septem
vindictas exoluet, Seuen seuerall reuenges shall bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of him.
Procopius</hi> answers hereunto, That this Proclamation was made against
<hi>Cain</hi>; For, a man cursed by God, persecuted by heauen, by earth, by
Angells, by men, by beasts, and by himselfe, would haue held it a happinesse to
dye; but God would not that he should inioy so great a blessing: But that he
should liue seuen generations, and that in euery one of them, God would take
seuere venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of him, <hi>Septem vindictas exoluet</hi>; till that
<hi>Lamech</hi> should come, who gaue him a sodaine and violent death. And this
is a notable place against all kind of murderers, and man slayers.
<hi>Dauid</hi> would not drinke of the water, though he were thirsty, which his
souldiers brought him, because it had cost them the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of their liues; and
therfore offered it vp in sacrifice to God. <hi>They did poure forth innocent
blood like water in the siege of Ierusalem. Dauid</hi> did shed the water,
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it seemed to him to be blood; and others shed blood as if it were but
wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: some take blood for water, and others, water for blood.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>They consulted to put Lazarus to death.</hi> The blanke and
  marke whereat they shot, was to darken and eclypse the name of our Sauiour
  Christ, and to cast a <pb n="605" facs="tcp:22083:323"/> cloud ouer that glory which could
  not possibly but shew it selfe, in seeing <hi>Lazarus</hi> to be raised vp from
  death vnto life. This dammage the Lord did repaire with two great honours.</p>
               <p>The first, That most solemne triumph wherewith they receiued
  him, wherof we shall treat hereafter.</p>
               <p>The second, of certaine Gentiles which came according to the
  custome to the feast. <hi>Leo</hi> the Pope saith, That the Romans made a
  religion of it to adore the seuerall gods of all Nations; and therefore they
  intreated Saint <hi>Philip,</hi> that he would be a meanes that they might haue
  a sight of our Sauiour Christ, and that they might bee admitted to speake with
  him: Saint <hi>Philip</hi> communicated this matter with Saint <hi>Andrew,</hi>
  and they both acquainted our Sauiour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. And Iesus answered, <hi>The
  houre is now come, that the Sonne of man shall bee made manifest.</hi> The
  Apostles did not vnderstand the mysterie thereof: but our Sauiour Christ tooke
  that his comming to be the <hi>despertador de su muerte,</hi> the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waker and
  reuiuer of his death: For although he imployed both his life and his person in
  Israel, yet his death was to draw the Gentiles to his knowledg and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.
  And these Gentiles being so desirous to see him, and to talke with him; taking
  this to be the Vigile of his death, and vocation of the Gentiles; Hee told
  them, <hi>Now is the houre come, wherein the Son of man is to be
  glorified,</hi> not onely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Iewes, but the Gentiles also.</p>
               <p>Hee calls his death his glorification. For, albeit to dye, be
  weakenesse, yet to dye as Christ dyed, was vnspeakeable valour, and
  vertue.<note place="margin">Christs death his glorifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> Hee neuer
  shewed himselfe more strong, than when hee was most weake; and neuer lookt
  sweeter than when death was in his face. <hi>Hee had hornes comming out of his
  hands,</hi> And there was the hiding of his power.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Abacuc.</hi> 3.</note> Those hands which were nayled to those
  armes of the Crosse, were those hornes wherewith hee ouerthrew the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of
  the world, and of hell. <hi>Iacob</hi> said of <hi>Simeon</hi> and
  <hi>Leui</hi> at the houre of his death, <hi>In their selfe-will they digged
  downe a wall,</hi> which the Seuentie translate thus, <hi>Eneruauerunt taurum,
  They weakened a Bull</hi>: By this bull,<note place="margin">Christ why called a
 Bull.</note> vnderstanding our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Christ.</p>
               <p>First, for it's beautie, <hi>Quasi primogeniti tauri pulchritudo

  like his first borne bullocke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, For that as the bulls strength lyes in his hornes, so
  did Christ dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer his strength vpon the Crosse, <hi>Ibi abscondita est
  fortitudo eius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, because (according vnto <hi>Pliny</hi>) the Bull
  looseth his fiercenesse, when hee but sees the shadow of the Figge-tree: And
  our Sauiour Christ shewed himselfe most weake, when hee saw the shadow of the
  Crosse, desiring pardon then of his Father for his enemies, who like dogges
  against a Bull, had with open mouth set themselues against him, <hi>Many dogs
  are come about mee.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Psal.</hi> 32.</note> But hee
  repayd (though not allayd) their rage with this so louing and so sweet a
  prayer, <hi>Father forgiue them, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Pharisees seeing themselues thus mockt and deluded, and that
  their plots and intentions tooke not effect, they brake foorth and sayd,
  <hi>Perceiue yee not, how we preuaile nothing? and how that the world goeth
  after him?</hi> And albeit Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> saith, That these
  speeches were vttered by his friends, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to persuade the Pharisees that
  they should not tyre out themselues any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in persecuting of him, seeing
  it was to no end, but all went crosse with them; Saint <hi>August.</hi> yet
  saith, That they were the speeches of his enemies, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned their owne
  disgrace and misfortune.</p>
               <p>There could not bee any blindnesse more foule and beastly, than
  that of the <pb n="606" facs="tcp:22083:324"/> high Priests and Pharisees; who hauing had
  so many tryalls, how little their power and their trickes could preuaile
  against our Sauiour Christ, that all this while they could not perceiue that
  this was Gods businesse, against which, nor counsell, nor wisedome can
  preuaile. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> preaching Christs resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the high
  Priests and Pharisees called him before them, notifying vnto him, That he
  should not any more touch vpon that point: but hee told them, That he was bound
  rather to obey God than man. And perceiuing his resolution, <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secabantur
  cordibus suis,</hi> They burst for anger when they heard it, and consulted to
  slay both him and his companions. But <hi>Gamaliel</hi> a Doctour of the Law,
  being there present, and one that was honoured of all the people, aduised those
  that sat there in Councel,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 5.</note>to put the
  Apostles forth for a little space out of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell house: which done, he
  then said vnto them, Men of Israel bee well aduised what ye doe concerning
  these men: Time will prooue whether this be a Truth or a Lye that these men
  vtter. It is not long since that one <hi>The<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>des</hi> boasted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to be a Prophet, who was followed by
  some foure hundred Disciples, but in the end he was condemned to death, and
  they al which obeyed him were scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered and brought to nought. After this man,
  rose vp <hi>Iudas</hi> of Galilee, and drew away much people after him, but he
  in the end also perished and all his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. And therefore I now say vnto
  ye, forbeare a while, and refraine your selues from these men, and let them
  alone: For if this their doctrine be of men, it will come to nought; but if it
  be of God ye cannot destroy it. In a word, Time will bring this to light: but
  to go about to take away their liues now from them, were to set your selues to
  fight against God. The like did the Prince of the Ammonits deliuer to
  <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> Lieutenant Generall, at the Siege of Bethulia; If God
  fauour and protect this people, all <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> forces are not
  able to subdue them. And this was that which made <hi>Iob</hi> so confident, Be
  thou on my side, and let all the world be against me, I care not. <hi>Saul</hi>
  did vse all his best endeauours, and employed all the force and strength he
  had, to worke <hi>Dauids</hi> death, one while in his owne person, seeking to
  nayle him with his Speare to the wall; another while by setting vpon him with
  his souldiers; but neuer yet could the power of a King preuaile without Gods
  permission, against a silly flye. <hi>Gods protection is aboue all his
  workes:</hi> so the Princes of the earth, the high Priests, the Pharisees, the
  Clergie, and the Laytie, did cry out against Christ, but were forced to say in
  the end, <hi>We preuayle nothing at all.</hi> They were strangely blinded, that
  they could not perceiue Gods power herein. Lord so open our eyes that we may
  see the light of thy glorious Gospell. To whom, &amp;c.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Secondly, it is contrary to naturall reason. For, to passe
sodainly from one extreame to another, though God doth it by extraordinary
wayes, yet neyther Nature, nor Art, nor the Diuell doth it, be it either from
ill to good, or from good to ill. <hi>Nemo repentè turpissimus,</hi>
said the Poet. The sanctitie of <hi>Peter</hi> sure was one of the greatest;
and to passe sodainely from a Saint, to an Infidell, (which is numbred amongst
those sins that are the most hainous) it cannot sinke into my head.</p>
            <p>Besides, Faith is like vnto your Ermine, who had rather <hi>mori,
quam foedari; ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dye, than durtie it selfe.</hi> And therefore Faith is
cloathed in white; a colour wherein the least spot or soyle shewes foulest.
Corresponding with that of Saint <hi>Paul, Hauing the mysterie of faith in a
pure conscience.</hi> The conscience wherein Faith is to reside, must be pure
and cleane: and as it goes soyling, so it goes lessening and losing it selfe.
And as is the blood of the soule, and the last humour which is vomited forth,
as it is to be seene in those that are sea-sicke; so is it in the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of
Faith, <hi>Peruenit gladius</hi> (saith <hi>Ieremie</hi>) <hi>vsque ad animam,
The sword hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred euen vnto my soule.</hi> Saint <hi>Ierome,</hi> That the
sword is come vnto the soule, <hi>Quando nihil in anima vitale reseruatur, When
there is not any vitall thing that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued in the soule,</hi> when all
goodnesse is gone out of it.<note place="margin">How Peter may be said to haue
  lost his faith.</note> But Saint <hi>Peter</hi> was not come to that desperate
passe, his case was farre otherwise. And if Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> say, That he
lost his Faith, he vnderstood thereby, that loyaltie and fidelitie which
<hi>Peter</hi> ought better to haue kept, or that confession of his faith,
which vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that occasion he was bound to haue made; according to that of Saint
<hi>Paul, With the heart we beleeue vnto righteousnesse, but with the mouth wee
confesse vnto sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</hi> 
               <pb n="608" facs="tcp:22083:325"/> And for that reprehension
which our Sauiour Christ bestowed vpon his Disciples at his departure for
heauen,<note place="margin">Of Peters Fall.</note> it is a cleere case, that it
was not directed to <hi>Peter,</hi> as appeareth by the words following, where
it is said, That the rest, when they were told by the women that he was risen
from the dead, it seemed vnto them as a feigned thing, neither beleeued they
them: But <hi>Peter</hi> was one of the first that ranne vnto our Sauiours
Sepulchre, and reuealed to the rest the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious resurrection of his Lord and
Sauiour.</p>
            <p>Other Doctours excusing <hi>Peter,</hi> say, That in this Deniall,
he spake Amphibo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logically, his words carrying a doubtfull or double meaning,
and yet might ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a good construction; and this opinion S. <hi>Ambrose,</hi>
S. <hi>Hilary,</hi> and S. <hi>Cyril</hi> toucht vpon: but the truth is, that
S. <hi>Peter</hi> did grieuously sinne therein, and that he had lost his loue,

            <p>That it is a dangerous peece of businesse to decline to the way of
death, it is a cleere case; but to the way of life, very darke and intricate.
S. <hi>Ierome</hi> saith, That the iust man should haue a care not to decline
to the right hand, because he may chance to offend God out of his double
diligence, as <hi>Vzza</hi> did, in staying the Arke, least it might fall to
the ground. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, That our best ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice may be
vnacceptable, if not sinfull, through our owne presumption. And so did
<hi>Peter</hi> sinne, presuming on his owne proper valour, and setled
resolution: which made our Sauiour Christ say vnto him, <hi>Thou shalt deny me
thrice</hi>; and hee replyed thrice, Rather than I will deny thee, I will dye a
thousand deaths. O Lord, either thou tellest me thus out of the feare of my
weaknesse, or to try me what I will doe, I haue but one life to loose, <hi>If
need were I would dye with thee, &amp;c.</hi> He promised that which was not in
the power of his strength to performe. Man promiseth he knowes not what,
because he knowes not himselfe. The Angell knew not what would follow: for had
he had this knowledge at the first, that alone would haue lessened his
contempt. <hi>Adam</hi> knew by reuelation, That his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage did represent
that of our Sauiour Christ with his Church; but he knew not the <hi>Media,</hi>
or meanes that led thereunto. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> would neuer haue presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
so much on himselfe, had he knowne what would haue followed thereupon: So that
he promised that which he was not possibly able to performe. But if pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming
on our Sauiour Christs fauour, he had told the wench that stood at the doore, I
am one of Christs Disciples, and I will lay downe my life for the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie
of his truth, and mine owne faith; he had secured his life: For it was not
possible that our Sauiour Christ should be false of his word, <hi>If ye seeke
me, suffer these first to goe their way.</hi> But euermore those men that most
presume, are most <pb n="609" facs="tcp:22083:325"/> deceiued. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> pursued the
children of Israel, boasting as he went, I will not leaue a man of them aliue,
I will at once make an end of these Slaues: But this presumption of his
succeeded so ill with him, that he and all his were made food for fishes,
<hi>They su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

bottome of the sea.</hi> And anon after it is said, <hi>Thy wrath did deuoure
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as the fire consumeth the straw.</hi> They perished first like lead,
because they descended euen to the bottome of the sea: and they perished like
straw, because they afterwards floated aboue water; to the end that the
chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Israel might behold in their drowned bodies, the powerfull hand of
God. That proud Philistim <hi>Goliah,</hi> vaunted himselfe, and cryed out vnto
<hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid, Come to me, and I will giue thy flesh vnto the fowles of the
heauen, and to the beasts of the field.</hi> He was an able and a valiant man,
but his valour was nothing answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his arrogancie and presumption, so
that for all his great brags, himselfe was made a prey for the Vultures.</p>
            <p>God would haue his friends to be valiant, yet cowards; weake, yet
strong; fearefull, and yet confident: and, that the one should grow from the
considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their owne weaknesse; and the other, from their affiance in
God. <hi>Moses</hi> fled (being afraid) from the Serpent; but being animated by
God, hee was so bold, as to take him by the tayle. <hi>Tobias</hi> out of
feare, fled from the fish, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by the Angell, he set vpon him, and
was strong enough to teare his iawes in sunder. And therefore Saint
<hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>All things are possible vnto me, in him that is my
strength and my comforter.</hi> And he might as well haue said, Without God I
can doe nothing, <hi>In deo meo</hi> (saith <hi>Dauid</hi>) <hi>transgrediar
murum, In my God, I will leape ouer a wall</hi>; Whereas without him, he is not
able to crawle ouer a Thre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shold. The Scribes and Pharisees did presume that
they should enioy those for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer good times and golden ages of their great
grandfathers and forefathers; but they were not confederat with them in
shedding the blood of the Prophets, and therefore our Sauiour made them this
answer, <hi>Behold,</hi>

And yet ye are not ashamed to say, That if ye had beene in the dayes of your

ought euery one to make of the victorie and the warre that is waged with the
soule; which whilest it liueth in this mortall body, cannot assure it selfe; so
various and doubtfull are the successes of this warre. When <hi>Iacob</hi> had

well say, the God of <hi>Isaac,</hi> as of <hi>Abraham?</hi> And <hi>Paulus
Burgensis</hi> answers thereunto out of the opinion of the Hebrewes, That God
was neuer called the God of any man,<note place="margin">God not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the God
  of any man, while he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth.</note> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest that man was liuing: because he

<hi>Abraham</hi> was dead, and <hi>Isaac</hi> liuing, he said, the God of
<hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and the feare of <hi>Isaac.</hi> After that braue resolution
which <hi>Abraham</hi> had to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice his sonne, God sayd vnto him, <hi>Now
I know that thou fearest God.</hi> But here another doubt now offers it selfe,
That <hi>Abraham</hi> hauing shewne such a great and <pb n="610" facs="tcp:22083:326"/>
extraordinarie token of his loue, why God did not say vnto him, <hi>I now know
that thou louest God.</hi> The reason is, That when a iust man comes to the top
and heigth of his loue, he may presume of himselfe, that he hath then begun to
loue. And, for that feare is the first step to loue, he sayd, <hi>Nunc cognoui

               <note place="margin">Truths sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome heard in Princes
  Courts.</note>The second occasion on <hi>Peters</hi> part, was the Pallace of
<hi>Caiphas.</hi> Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith, That <hi>Peter</hi> comming to
warme himselfe at the Pallace, came to denie the truth. For where Truth it
selfe was taken prisoner, he had need of a great deale of courage, that should
not incline to a lye. <hi>Aeneas Syluius</hi> reporteth, That
<hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dericke</hi> Archduke of Austria, would goe a nights disguised through
the Tauerns and Victualing houses belonging to the Court, only to heare what
they sayd of himselfe, and his Ministers; &amp; being demanded, why he did
expose his person to that perill? his answer was, Because in Court they neuer
tell truth. <hi>Plutarch</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counteth of King <hi>Antiochus,</hi> That
hauing lost himselfe a hunting, hee lighted vpon a Cottage where were a
companie of shepheards, and asking them being at supper, What the world said of
the King and his Ministers? The King (said they) hath the report of a good
honest gentleman, but that the State was neuer worse gouerned than now, for it
is serued by the greediest and the gripingest Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters that were in the
world: and when he came backe againe to Court, he told those that were about
him; Since I first tooke possession of this my Kingdome, I neuer heard the
truth of things till yesterday. Amongst foure hundred Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, which
<hi>Ahab</hi> consulted,<note place="margin">3. <hi>Reg.</hi> 22.</note> onely
hee met with one that would not lye vnto him, and the King hated him for
telling him the truth. Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> calls the Pallace,
<hi>Basilica,</hi> deriuing it from the Basiliske, which kills with it's looke.
Of this creature <hi>Aelian</hi> saith, That he vomiteth forth his poyson vpon
a stone: And it fits well for <hi>Peter,</hi> whom our Sauiour Christ termed
<hi>Petram</hi>; vpon whom the diuell (whom the Scripture stiles a Basiliske)
vomited foorth his poyson. Our Sauiour Christ receiued much kindnesse and
courtesie in the house of <hi>Martha,</hi> of <hi>Zacheus,</hi> and the
Pharisee; but in <hi>Herods</hi> Pallace they made a foole of him; In that of
<hi>Pilat,</hi> they whipt him, and crowned him with thornes; and in that of
<hi>Caiphas</hi> he receiued so many affronts, that God onely knowes what they
were: according to that which <hi>Dauid</hi> said in his name, <hi>Tu scis
impropirum meum, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusionem meam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third occasion was, That hee would enter into the Pallace, by
being brought in by the hands of a woman.<note place="margin">S. Peters sinne
  like that of Adam.</note> Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> saith, <hi>Si infidelitas
intrat, quid mirum, si infideliter agat? Maximus Tirronensis</hi> saith, That
<hi>Peters</hi> sinne was much like vnto that of <hi>Adam</hi>: there being
imployed in both of them, a man, a woman, and a diuell. <hi>Adam</hi> had a
warning not to eate, <hi>Peter</hi> not to denie: <hi>Eue</hi> was the
oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion that <hi>Adam</hi> did eate; and <hi>Cayphas</hi> maid-seruant, that
<hi>Peter</hi> did denie. In a word, a woman was the instrument of all our
deaths, and threw downe to the ground those two Columbs and pillars of the
world: but <hi>Peters</hi> fall was the fou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, <pb n="611" facs="tcp:22083:326"/> for
<hi>Eue</hi> proceeded with inticements and flatteries, and <hi>Adam</hi>
suffered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to be ouercome, <hi>Ne contristaret delitias, Lest he should
grieue his Loue.</hi> But this woman (saith Saint <hi>Augustine</hi>) proceeded
with threatnings; now a woman is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry powerfull in matter of allurements,
inticings, dalliance, and deceiuing, through profession of loue: but in matter
of feare (as Saint <hi>Gregorie</hi> hath obserued) shee is very weake. A woman
triumphed ouer <hi>Sampson, Dauid, Salomon, Sisera,</hi> and
<hi>Holophernes,</hi> by making loue, and vsing deceit: but here a maid, with
only a bunch of keyes hanging at her girdle, triumphed ouer <hi>Peter,</hi> by
feare.</p>
            <p>The fourth occasion was, Saint <hi>Peters</hi> offering to thrust
into the Pallace. <hi>Ioseph</hi> could not auoid the occasion, because his
Mistresse called him vnto her; <hi>Dauid</hi> did cast his eye aside by chance:
but <hi>Peter</hi> did seeke occasion, <hi>And he that loues anger shall perish
by it.</hi> He doth not say, He that loues warre or victorie, but he that loues
danger. Many of the children of Israel did cut off the thumbs from their
fingers, because they would excuse themselues from prophanation, by singing the
songs of Sion; and being importuned thereunto, <hi>Sing vnto vs one of the
songs of Sion</hi>; They answered, <hi>How shall we sing one of the Lords songs
in a strange land, &amp;c. Osee</hi> saith, <hi>Non vocabis me vltra Baalim,
sed vocabis me vir meus. Baalim</hi> is the same, as <hi>Vir meus,</hi> But
because there was an Idol that was called <hi>Baalim,</hi> God said, Doe not
call me <hi>Baalim</hi>; to the end that no man may presume that thou yet
bearest <hi>Baalim</hi> still in thy mind, or for to take all occasion from
thee, of thinking thereof any more.</p>
            <p>On Gods part there are likewise very good reasons.<note place="margin">Man bya sight of his owne weaknesse is taught to pity an
  others.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The first shall be of Saint <hi>Gregorie.</hi> Saint
<hi>Peter</hi> being to bee a Pastor, it was fit that he should fall into so
foule a fault, least that afterwards he should be scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized by other mens
offences, and carry too sharpe and hard a hand towards sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. Saint
<hi>Augustine</hi> touches vpon the same reason, in his bookes <hi>de Ciuitate
Dei,</hi> persuading the Bishops of Galilea,<note place="margin">Reasons why
  Christ suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Peter to deny him.</note> That Clemencie should sway more with
them, than seueritie; loue, than power; softnesse, than sharpnesse; for, there
is no man that liues without sinne. And if our Sauiour Christ should haue
censured <hi>Peter</hi> after his first deniall, he would not haue reapt from
thence so much fruit, as now he did.</p>
            <p>The second shall be of Saint <hi>August.</hi> who sayes, That it
is a wholesom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine for a
proud man, to suffer him to fall into some grieuous and manifest sinne; to the
end, that the foulenesse of that fault may abate his pride. Saint
<hi>Peter</hi> was so peremptorie and so presumptuous, that he did presse this
point with such a deale of confidence and boldnesse, that he told his Master,
<hi>Though that all men shall be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by thee, yet will I neuer bee
offended.</hi>
               <note place="margin">M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t. 26.</note> And Christ then telling him that hee should denie him
thrice, he presently reply'd thereupon; Though I should dye with thee, yet will
I not denie thee: but you see how this his courage was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards cooled.
Which presumption of his, when he saw his great weaknesse, he humbly bewailed
with many a bitter teare, which turned to his exceeding great good. And this
reason is confirmed by Saint <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> who saith, That God
permitted <hi>Peter</hi> to denie his Master, that he might thereby learne to
relie more vpon God, than himselfe. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> gaue lesse credit to
Christs words, than his owne resolution: but the successe thereof did put him
out of his errour. <hi>Leo</hi> the Pope saith, That God did suffer
<hi>Peter</hi> thus to fall, that the holiest might take heed not to trust too
much to their owne strength. <hi>Euthimius</hi> further addeth, that this
negation of his, was as it were a <hi>Fiador,</hi> or suretie, against anie
bosting or glorying in those so many miracles, which were afterwards to bee
wrought by <hi>Peter.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith of himselfe, That the
pricks that he had in his flesh, did serue <pb n="612" facs="tcp:22083:327"/> as so many
<hi>Piguelas</hi> or lines to your hawkes iesses, that hee might not sore too
high, being puffed vp with these his many reuelations, <hi>Ne magnitudo
reuelatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num extollat me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third shall be of <hi>Leo</hi> the Pope, who saith, That God
did permit in <hi>Peter</hi> so great a sin, <hi>Vt in Ecclesia remedium
poenitentiae conderetur,</hi> For the better foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and establishing in the
Church, the authoritie and efficacie of repentance. The like reason is rendred
by Saint <hi>Ierome,</hi> By <hi>Peters</hi> fall (saith he) was manifested the
vertue of repentance, against the poyson of sinne: which is all one with that
of Saint <hi>Paul</hi>; I was a blasphemer, a persecuter, &amp;c. And God was
content to giue way thereunto, <hi>for the better instruction of those that
were to beleeue hereafter.</hi> He that makes treacle, tryes it first vpon his
owne child, &amp;c. God sent <hi>Ieremie</hi> to the Potters shop, that he
might see how the broken vessell was to be new mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded againe, and come out
better than before. <hi>And shall not I be able to do as much with you, as the
Potter with his clay?</hi> Where it is to be noted, That as the clay
of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes receiues a better forme and fashion than at first, and for more
honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vse: So (saith Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> and <hi>Euthymius</hi>)
<hi>Peter</hi> was made much the better by this.</p>
            <p>First, because it was a very good warning vnto him, not to presume
any more on himselfe. And therefore Christ asking him whether he loued him? He
durst neither say I nor no.</p>
            <p>Secondly, because God pardoning this his disloyaltie, it was but a
further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flaming of his loue, and setting his heart more on fire in the zeale
of his seruice; according to that saying of our Sauiour Christ, <hi>He little
loues to whom little is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen.</hi> In a word, it was a fulfilling of
<hi>Abacucs</hi> prophesie, If thou didst hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore tread one step in the way
of death, thou shalt now tread ten for it in the way of life.</p>

               <hi>Then he began to curse himselfe, and to sweare,
&amp;c,</hi> This his negation or deniall, was foretold by <hi>Dauid, I looked

also by <hi>Ieremie, They haue denyed the Lord, and said it is not he.</hi> S.
<hi>Peter</hi> had learned in the schoole of Christ, Let your Communication be

Disciples, He answered, <hi>I am not.</hi> But she reply'd vnto him, Thou art;
<hi>For thy speech doth bewray thee.</hi> But he, that he might auoid all
spies, or any further inquirie, <hi>Began to fall a cursing, &amp;c.</hi> How
now <hi>Peter?</hi> Art thou well in thy wits? knowest thou what thou doest?
Thou that sawst thy Sauiour so glorious in Tabor, Thou that confessedst him to
be the Sonne of the liuing God, Thou, whom hee called, together with thy
brother <hi>Andrew,</hi> to be fishers of men; Thou, to whom he stretcht foorth
his hand in the sea, to saue thee from drowning; doest thou not know him? I
know him not. O <hi>Peter</hi> lament thy ignorance, for thou hast beene more
cruell to thy Master than all they that conspired against him, and laid their
heads together to torment him: for as for them, some bound his hands, others
his necke, others spat in his face, these buffeted him, those platted thornes
on his head, others pulled him by the beard, and tugged him by the haire, one
pierced his side; but thou didst runne him through the heart. O <hi>Peter</hi>
(saith Saint <hi>Augustine</hi>) What is become of your courage now? What, of
your great brags? What of this your protestation and strong resolution, <hi>I
will lay downe my life for thee?</hi> And of that your, Why should I not follow
thee, and die with thee? There was no torment that troubled <hi>Iob</hi> so
much, as that his friends should forsake him, <hi>My friends and familiar
acquaintance stood afarre off from me. Dauid</hi> was not so sensible of any of
all his persecutions, as that of his sonne <hi>Absalon</hi>; And <hi>Iulius
Caesar</hi> tooke it not halfe <pb n="613" facs="tcp:22083:327"/> so tenderly at any of the
other Traytors hands, as of his sonne <hi>Brutus,</hi> and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore said vnto
him when he stabd him, <hi>Et tu quoque Brute? Ha Brutus art thou in this
Conspiracie?</hi> Gentiles and Iewes, Ecclesiasticks and Seculars, Patritians
and Plebeyans, did all conspire against Christ; but none of those iniuries that
they offered him, toucht his heart so neere as <hi>Peters</hi> Deniall of him.
That <hi>Iudas</hi> should sell him, betray him, and deliuer him vp into his
enemies hands; that the high Priests, <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilat</hi> should
desire his death, and consent thereunto, it was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, because they hated
him and were his professed enemies: But that <hi>Peter</hi> should denie him,
to whom he had made such glorious promises, and hauing so often made offer vnto
him of his life, that he should play the <hi>Renegado,</hi> and deale thus and
thus, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Then the Lord turned backe, and looked vpon Peter, and Peter
went out and wept bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly.</hi> Saint <hi>Luke</hi> like a good Painter
drawes me <hi>Peter</hi> first with a cole, but now he giues him his more
liuely colours. The first variegation and garnishment that he giues this peece,
was, our Sauiour Christs looking back vpon <hi>Peter:</hi> How he looked on
him, we haue handled elsewhere. The effect, which this his looking on him
wrought, was the making of his heart to melt like waxe; and the turning of
Christs eye, the turning of <hi>Peters</hi> eyes into two fountaines. The
Astrologers say, That he that is borne in the aspect of <hi>Mars,</hi> is
sterne and cruell; in that of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> mercifull and courteous; in
that of <hi>Mercurie,</hi> industrous and eloquent. The beams of the sun
inlighten the ayre, dispellclouds, fertilize the fields, breeds pearles in the
shels of the riuers, corall in the bottome of the sea, gold, siluer, and other
mettalls in the veynes of the earth, and like a well ordred clocke, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernes
all the world. What shall the Son of righteousnesse doe then with the beames of
his Eyes? <hi>Sidonius Apolinaris</hi> reports of those of Thracia,<note place="margin">The power of Christs eyes.</note> That for to signifie the vertue
and power of the eyes of our Sauiour Christ, they did paint a sunne, whence
three Raies, or bright-shining beames brake forth: the one, rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing vp one
that was dead; the other did breake a stonie heart; and the third did melt a
snowie mountaine; and the Motto was this, <hi>Oculi Dei, ad nos.</hi> The
beames of Christs eyes raise vp the dead, breake rocks, and melt snow, <hi>A
facie tua</hi> (saith <hi>Esay</hi>) <hi>montes defluent.</hi> The fire which
they hid in the transmigration of Babylon, the children of Israel found at
their returne, turned into water; but exposing it to the beames of the sunne,
it grew againe to be fire, to the great admiration of the beholders: which is a
figure of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> who through his coldnes became wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but the
beames of the Sonne of righteousnesse, raised a great fire out of this water.
<hi>Pliny</hi> reports of certaine stones in Phrygia, that being beaten vpon by
the beames of the sunne, send forth drops of water: But the beames of the Sonne
of righteousnesse did not onely from this <hi>Petra,</hi> or stone Saint
<hi>Peter,</hi> draw teares, but whole riuers of water. According to that of
<hi>Dauid,</hi>

the rocke into water-pooles, and the flint into a fountaine of water.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> seemeth to stand somewhat vpon it, why
<hi>Peter</hi> did not aske for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenes of his sins at Gods hands?
<hi>Inuenio</hi> (saith he) <hi>quod fleuerit, no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> inuenio quid dix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erit;
lachrymas lego, satisfactionem non lego; I find that he wept, but do not find
what he said; I read his teares, but read not his satisfaction.</hi> The
reasons of this his silence, and that he did not craue pardon of God by word of
mouth, are these:</p>
            <p>First, because he had runne himselfe into discredit by his rash
offers, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by his stiffe deniall; and therefore thought with
himselfe, That it was not possible for him to expresse more affection with his
mouth, than he had vttered heretofore, <hi>Etiam si oportuerit me mori tecum,
non te negabo, &amp;c.</hi> And that tongue which had deny'd him, to whom it
had giuen so good an assurance, could neuer <pb n="614" facs="tcp:22083:328"/> (as he
thought) deserue to be beleeued. And therefore our Sauiour questioning him
afterwards concerning his loue, he durst not answer more than this, <hi>Thou
knowest, ô Lord, whether I loue thee or no.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, he askes not pardon by words, because the pledges of the
heart are so sure, that they admit no deceit. And for that, <hi>Lachryma sunt
cordis sanguis, Tears are the hearts blood</hi>; S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> therfore
saith, <hi>Lachrymaru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> preces, vtiliores sunt, qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sermonu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; quia sermo in
precando fortè fallit, lachryma omnino non fallit: The prayers of teares
are more profitable, than of words; for words in praying, may now and then
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue vs, but teares neuer.</hi> S. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> saith, That our
sinnes are set downe in the Table-booke of Gods memorie; but that teares are
the sponge which blotteth them out. And indeering the force of teares, he
saith, That in Christs souldier, the noblest Act that he can do, is to shed his
blood in his seruice, <hi>Maiorem charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem nemo habet, &amp;c.</hi> For what
our blood shed for Christ, effecteth; that doth our teares for our sinnes.
<hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> did not shed her blood, but she shed her teares: And
Saint <hi>Peter</hi> did not now shed blood, but hee shed teares; which were so
powerfull, that after that hee had wept, hee was trusted with a part of the
gouernment of the Church; who before hee had wept, had not gouernment of
himselfe:<note place="margin">The efficacie of Teares.</note> for teares cure our
wounds, cheere our soules, ease the conscience, and please God, <hi>O lachryma
humilis</hi> (saith Saint <hi>Ierome</hi>) <hi>tuum est reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, &amp;c. O
humble Teare, thine is the kingdome, thine is the power, thou fearest not the
Iudges Tribunall, thou inioynest silence to thine accusers: if thou enter
emptie, thou doest not goe out emptie; thou subduest the inuincible, and
bindest the omnipotent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence it is that the diuell beareth such enuie to our Teares. When
<hi>Holofernes</hi> had dryed vp the fountaines of Bethulia, hee held the Citie
his: and the Diuell when he shall come to dry vp the teares in our eyes, when
he hath stopt vp those waters that should flow from the soule of a sinner, hee
hopes he is his. <hi>Elian</hi> of Tryphon, the Tyrant, reports of this one
vnheard-of crueltie: Fearing his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects would conspire against him, he made
a publike Edict, that they should not talke one with another; and being thus
debarr'd of talking one with another, they did looke very pittifully one vpon
another, communicating their minds by their eyes. And being forbid by a second
Edict, that they should not so much as looke one vpon another, when they saw
they were restrained of that libertie likewise, wheresoeuer they met one
another, they fell a weeping. This seemed to the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant the damnablest and
most dangerous conspiracie of all the rest, and resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to put them to death.
The diuell is afraid of our words, afraid of our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but much more
afraid of our teares. O Lord so mollifie our sinfull hearts, that whensoeuer we
offend thee, our words, our affections, and our teares, may in all deuotion and
humilitie present themselues before thee, crauing par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for our sinnes. Which
we beseech thee to grant vs for thy deare Sonne Christ Iesus sake. To whom with
the holy Spirit, be all prayse, honour, and glorie, &amp;c.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are three most notable Conuersions, which the Church doth
celebrate.</p>
            <p>That of Saint <hi>Paul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That of <hi>Mary Magdalen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That of the good Theefe.</p>
            <p>The one, liuing here vpon earth.</p>
            <p>The other, now raigning in heauen.</p>
            <p>The third, dying vpon the Crosse.</p>
            <p>Of all the rest, this seemeth to be the most prodigious and most
strange.</p>
            <p>First, because <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> saw many of our Sauiour
Christs myracles, heard many of his Sermons; and besides, her sisters good
example might worke much good vpon her.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saw Christ rounded about with
glorie, more resplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent than the Sunne; had heard that powerfull voyce which
threw him downe from his horse, and put him in the hands of that dust whereof
hee was created.</p>
            <p>But the Theefe neither saw Miracle, nor Sermon, nor example, nor
glorie, nor light, nor voyce, saue onely Christ rent and torne vpon the Crosse,
as if hee had beene as notorious a theefe as those that suffered on either side
of him.</p>
            <p>Againe, How much the quicker is the motion, and the extreames more
di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, repugnant, and contrarie, by so much the more strange and wonderfull
is this change and alteration. This theef was a huge way off from either
beleeuing, or louing our Sauiour Christ: and that hee should now on the sodaine
and in so short a space, passe from a theefe to a Martyr, from the gallowes to
Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise, must needs be an admirable change. <hi>Mira mutatio</hi> (saith S.
<hi>Leo</hi>) <hi>vt insidia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor viarum, vsque ad Crucem reus, sit Christi
repente Confessor, This is a wonderfull <pb n="616" facs="tcp:22083:329"/> change, that a
high-way robber, condemned here to the Crosse, should in the turning of a hand
come to confesse Christ.</hi> In this one action did all the attributes of God
shine and shew themselues in a most glorious manner; and especially his
wisedome, in making these extreames to meet and ioyne together so on the
sodaine, and as it were in an instant.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Eccl.</hi>
  3.</note> 
               <hi>Ecclesiastes</hi> saith, That there is a time to bee borne, and a
time to dye; a time to plant, and a time to plucke vp that which is planted; a
time to slay, and a time to heale; a time to breake downe, and a time to build;
a time to weepe, and a time to laugh: All these extreames did his wisedome knit
and linke together. In this action meete those two extreames of being borne,
and of dying; for as much as wee see this theefe dye to the world, and to bee
borne anew to Christ. (And the death of the righteous, the Church stiles it a
birth.) Those of planting, and plucking vp that which is planted; because grace
is here planted in the soule of the theefe, and sinne pluckt vp. Those of
slaying, and healing; for that our Sauiour Christ receiues these mortall wounds
in his owne bodie, and healeth those of the theefe. Those of building, and
breaking downe that is built; In regard that the body of sinne is destroyed,
and the building of grace is set vp in him. Those of weeping and laughing; in
that the theefe doth now bewaile his sinnes, and laughes for ioy to heare the
gladsome newes of heauen. In a word, the more incurable that the diseases are
which a Physitian cureth, the more (saith Saint <hi>Augustine</hi>) is his
skill and cunning to be commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
            <p>Gods omnipotencie, was likewise seene herein: Saint
<hi>Chrysostome</hi> saith, That it was so great a Miracle, that the Sunne
should be darkened, that the earth should tremble and shake, that the stones
should dash their heads one against ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or that the vayle of the Temple
should bee rent in twaine; as was the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightning of a blind vnderstanding,
the mollifying of a hard and stonie heart, and the remoouing from the soule,
the vayle of it's ignorance. And the truth of this may very well bee prooued by
<hi>Moses</hi> his rod, to whose Empire, though the earth, the sea, the
elements, light, darkenesse, and all creatures whatsoeuer were obedient, yet
could it not mooue hard-hearted <hi>Pharaohs</hi> brest.</p>
            <p>He likewise discouered his omnipotencie, in making the Theefe an
instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to reuenge himselfe of the Diuell, of the Pharisees, of Pilat, and
of the people.</p>
            <p>Of the diuell, who (as Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith) had blasoned
it abroad to the world, and triumphed greatly therin, That our Sauiour Christ
hauing but twelue Apostles, he had woon one of them from him; persuading him,
that it were the better life of the two to be a theefe, than an Apostle: but
for a <hi>Iudas,</hi> a poore base theefe, which stole but blankes and
farthings, from the pouertie of that sacred Colledge, Christ won a theefe from
him, which had spent his whole life in the diuels seruice and had committed
many famous robberies and notorious thefts. Theeues are the diuells weapons:
but our Sauiour Christ being the stronger of the two, tooke from him the
greatest theefe in the world, leauing him with his owne sword confounded and
ashamed,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cant</hi> 1.</note> 
               <hi>I haue compared thee
ô my Loue to the troupes of horses in Pharaohs charriots. Salomon</hi>
had great store of horses of the Aegyptian race for to furnish his charriots,
and to feare his enemies (as the French vse to wage warre against Spaine with
Spanish Gennets,) He then saith, that as <hi>Salomon</hi> made war against the
Aegyptians, with the horses of Aegypt: so the Church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundeth the diuell
with his owne Armes, which are theeues and robbers. Confounding and making
ashamed <hi>Pilat,</hi> the high Priests, the Pharisees, and the people, with
the tongue of a theefe. There is not any thing in the world more 
<pb n="617" facs="tcp:22083:329"/> infamous than a theefe. Of all basenesse it was the
greatest, that our Sauiour should die as a theefe. It was much that hee should
become man, <hi>Exinaniuit se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metipsum</hi>; more that hee should take vpon him
the forme of a seruant; <hi>Formam serui accipiens</hi>; and more then that,
That he should be no more esteemed of than a worme of the earth; and more yet
then this, That he should take vpon him in his Circumcision the image of a
sinner; but most of all, that hee should die as a notable theefe, betwixt two
theeues. In the garden he said, <hi>Ye come forth to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend me as if I had
beene a Theefe.</hi> There he was taken like a theefe, here condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to death
as a theefe, that no man might take pittie of him. There is no man that dies by
the hand of Iustice but is pittied of the people, saue only the theefe; not one
that takes compassion of him. He that seeth a theefe hung vp in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
vseth as he passeth by, to say, <hi>Benedictum lignum, per quod fit Iustitia,
Blessed be that gallowes, on which such good Iustice is done.</hi> The Church
receiueth the Iewes, the Moore, and the Gentile, but will not entertaine a
theefe. In <hi>Leuiticus,</hi> God did forbid the Weasil, and the Mouse, and
the frog, also the Rat, and the Lyzard, and the Cameleon, and the Crocodile,
and the Mole, as vncleane and vnfit to be eaten: and if you will but reade in
the naturall Histories the conditions and properties of these creatures, you
shall see that they are all theeues. It made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men maruell, That the
Crocodile being so great a creature, the diuine Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian should reckon him vp
amongst these other contemptible &amp; small creatures. And <hi>Rodolphus
Flauiacensis</hi> renders the reason of it to be this, That they haue all of
them theeuish qualities. The Crocodile more particularly swims in the sea,
runnes on the land, one while by day, another while by night; she layes a verie
little egge, which afterward growes to be a great beast, and goes still
increasing as long as shee liueth; and is not onely the stampe and figure of a
Sea-pyrat, but of a Land-robber, which night and day seekes all occasions to
rob and steale. Like vnto that theefe which in some poore country village,
begins first to fall a pilfring of some sixe royalls, and from this so small a
beginning, raiseth his stock to fiftie thousand Ducats, and comes at last to be
a <hi>Regidor,</hi> a <hi>Cauallero,</hi> and a <hi>Titu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lado.</hi> And by this
so vile and errant a theefe, as is here now treated of, our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Christ did
confound all Ierusalem. He might haue made vse of the tongue of a Prophet, or
an Euangelist; but as <hi>Sampson</hi> shewed his valour in conquering a
thousand armed men with the iawe-bone of an Asse, which had not approued it
selfe to be so great, had he made vse of <hi>Golias</hi> his sword, or
<hi>Hercules</hi> club, or of <hi>Theseus</hi> his mace, so our Sauiour Christ,
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>Gods mercie in this case, did also shew it selfe exceedingly.
Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, That this Conuersion was an especiall Myracle
of Christs affronts and wounds. He deliuered vp himselfe to the shame and
reproch of the Crosse, that he might glorifie this theefe. That he might saue a
theefe, was the intent of his dying betweene two theeues. And in another place,
he saith, That he was nay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led on the Crosse, and suffered his blood to be shed,
that he might cleanse a will that was growne so aged and foule with sinne.
<hi>Thomas</hi> saith, That it is Gods great mercie, that those that are growne
old in their sinnes, should be saued: For, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing by ill and long custome
their taste so quite marred and spoyled, they abhor that which should giue them
health, and dye in the end by the hands of their owne foolish longings. On
their graues that died by the fire of Gods wrath, whilest the flesh of their
quayles was yet betweene their teeth, this Epitaph was put; <hi>Sepulchra
concupiscentiae.</hi> For commonly, these their masters and their delights are
both buryed together. And therefore S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.</note> 
               <hi>Now these are ensamples to vs, to
the intent that we should not lust after euill things, as they also
lusted.</hi> The truth <pb n="618" facs="tcp:22083:330"/> is alwayes answerable to the
figure: and if you prolong your longings as they did in your life time, your
death like theirs will be likewise bad. Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> treating vpon
that place of Saint <hi>Matthew,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.</note>
               <hi>The axe is now put to the root of the tree,</hi> saith, That the tree doth
for the most part fall to that side, whereunto the weight of it's boughs
causeth it to incline; and that our lustfull longings and desires are the
boughs of this tree, inclining the contrary way. And therefore if a mans whole
life shall leane wholly vnto sinne, and incline it selfe to wickednesse, it
must be Gods exceeding great mercie, if it fall at last vnto Grace.</p>
            <p>Gods mercy was also the more, in regard of this theeues
blaspheming of him, <hi>The theeues likewise reuiled him.</hi> Saint
<hi>Augustine, Epiphanius, Anselme,</hi> Saint <hi>Ierome,</hi> Saint
<hi>Ambrose,</hi> and <hi>Beda</hi> saith, That the plurall number is put here
for the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular; and that onely one thiefe did blaspheme,by the figure
<hi>Synedoche,</hi> or <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logia,</hi> as it seemeth to Saint
<hi>Augustine</hi>; which (according to Saint <hi>Ierome</hi>) is a figure
frequently vsed in Scripture. Saint <hi>Luke</hi> saith, That the souldiers
gaue our Sauiour vinegre to drinke, whereas the rest of the Euangelists speake
onely of one.<note place="margin">

gold, <hi>Ye will not worship our Gods.</hi> Dauid treating of <hi>Herod</hi>
and <hi>Pilat,</hi> as appeareth by that of the <hi>Acts,</hi> saith, <hi>The
Kings of the earth band themselues, and the Princes are assembled together
against the Lord, and against his Christ.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in his
Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue which he makes of the Saints, saith, <hi>They stopped the mouths of
Lyons; Daniel</hi> being the onely man that did it: so, <hi>Secti sunt,</hi>
When it was onely <hi>Esayas</hi> that was sawne asunder. Againe,
<hi>Circuierunt me loris,</hi> which had onely reference to <hi>Elias.</hi> And
it is a very vsuall phrase both in the Latine and the Spanish tongue, to say,
<hi>Alexandros, Annibales, Scipiones, &amp;c.</hi> And a maine argument hereof,
is that sharpe and seuere reprehension wherewith hee rebuked his companion,
that blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Christ; saying vnto him, <hi>Fearest thou not God, seeing thou
art in the same con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation?</hi> Who if he had blasphemed our Sauiour, would
neuer haue so round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reprooued him.</p>
            <p>Of a contrary opinion to this is Saint <hi>Ierome,</hi> Saint
<hi>Chrysostome, Cyril, Hilary, Thomas, Origen, Theophilact, Euthimius,</hi>
Saint <hi>Ambrose,</hi> and Saint <hi>Marke,</hi> and Saint <hi>Matthew</hi>
seeme to expresse as much in plaine termes: but be it in that sence that they
would haue it, it is but so much the more indeering of Gods mercie, who also
hath compassion euen of the beasts of the field. According to that which
<hi>Esay</hi> prophesied,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Esay</hi> 43. <hi>Iob</hi>

haue said, It is not much that the starres of heauen should praise me, or the
Quire of Angels, or the children of God, which are captiuated by their
knowledge of me, &amp; the benefits that I haue heaped vpon them. But that a
theefe, a villaine, one that was bred vp in bushes, and lay lurking to doe
mischiefe in the thickest of the woods, and in mountai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous places, that such a
one should praise and magnifie my name, it must haue an Epithite beyond more
than much.</p>
            <p>Lastly, The diuine prouidenc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

the frozen brest of a sinner, and in those stormes of our sinnes, as thicke and
as hard as hayle, God hath hidden and stored vp (as Saint <hi>Gregorie</hi>
saith) against the day of trouble, the great and rich treasures of his
grace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>There were two theeues crucified with him, one on the right
hand, and the other on the <pb n="619" facs="tcp:22083:330"/> left.</hi> The doubt which in
this storie doth most grauell mens thought, is, That of two theeues which were
crucified on either side of our Sauior, the one should be saued, and the other
damned. S. <hi>Aug.</hi> renders two reasons thereof. And first of all we are
to suppose, that there it not any cause of predestination: <hi>Before that they
had done either good or euill, I loued Iacob, and hated Esau</hi>; So saith
Saint <hi>Paul.</hi> And in another place, <hi>Hath not the Potter power out of
the same masse or lumpe, to make one vessell for honour, and another for
dishonor?</hi> Some for to serue in the kitchin, and some to set vpon the
table. The iudgements of God are secret, which wee must rather reuerence than
inquire into, crying out with the same Apostle, <hi>O altitudo aiuitiarum,
&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, it is to be supposed, that of our vocation to faith,
there is likewise no cause giuen. And therefore in this point, we must take
Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> along with vs, who saith, <hi>Quare hunc trahat, hunc
non trahat? id est; Ad fidem, noli iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>care, si non vis errare. Iudge not, why
he drawes this man to Faith and not that.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> brings in the example of
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> and <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar,</hi> whom God sought to draw vnto him
with one and the selfe-same kind of force and violence: But the one did follow
him that lent him his hand to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect him, and the other refused to be guided
by him. They were both men ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to nature; both Kings, according to their
dignitie; both had sinned alike, <hi>Quoad culpam,</hi> for they had made Gods
people slaues, and vsed them very ill and hardly; and <hi>quoad poenam,</hi>
they were both of them punished with stripes from heauen. The warning was alike
to both: but how then comes it to passe, That the meanes being in both alike,
the ends should be so diuers and different? That the one should acknowledge
Gods power, and repenting his wickednesse, sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed with teares, and said,
<hi>I Nebuchadnezzar praise and glorifie the King of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen</hi>; But the
other persisting in his obstinacie, said, <hi>I know not the Lord, Who is the
Lord? &amp;c.</hi> In this account may come in those two seruants of
<hi>Pharaoh,</hi> which were fellow-prisoners with <hi>Ioseph,</hi> whereof the
one was saued, and the other hanged. We may likewise put into the reckoning
those two, of whom Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> saith, that grinding in one mill,
<hi>The one shall be receiued, and the other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.</note> And those two, who standing by
<hi>Aaron,</hi> when he was offering incense, the one was strucken dead, and
the other remained aliue. And as in the Tribunall of iudgement, God shall put
the sheepe on the right hand, and the goates on the left, and shall separate
the good fishes from the bad, and chaffe from the corne, and the tares from the
wheat; so in the Tribunall of the Crosse, <hi>Leo</hi> the Pope saith, he
condemned the blasphemous theefe, and saued the good theefe.</p>
            <p>The second morall reason, was to teach vs in those two
theeues,<note place="margin">The nature of Hope and Fea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e.</note> the easiest and the safest way to heauen: To
wit, That a soule should liue betweene hope and feare. Feare is the bridle
which holds in Hope; Hope is the anchor which se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureth Feare. Feare makes thee
a coward, considering what thou art, &amp; the smal worth that is in thee: But
Hope makes thee confident, considering what God is, and his infinite clemencie.
Vpon these two vertues, God imployeth all his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours, <hi>Gods eyes are vpon
those that feare him, and those that trust in his mercie:</hi> For he hath his
eyes nayled vnto those which feare him,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi>
  49.</note> and place their hopes on his goodnesse. <hi>Iacob</hi> prophesied of
<hi>Isachar,</hi> That he should be a strong Asse, cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching downe betweene two
burthens. It is a common saying, That those are not to be trusted that liue
between two Kingdomes: because borderers (for the most part) are a bold and
vnruly people. But here it is quite otherwise, The best people for heauen, are
those that liue between the Feare of hell, and the Hope of heauen. Saint
<hi>Augustine</hi> declares the extraordinarie happinesse of this vertue of 
<pb n="620" facs="tcp:22083:331"/> Feare, <hi>Beatipauperes Spiritu, Blessed are the poore
in Spirit,</hi> For they that haue much to loose, liue still in feare. A stout
Roman being threatned by <hi>Caesar,</hi> told him, <hi>Mihi senectus metum
ademit, Old age hath made mee fearelesse:</hi> Hee had but a few yeares to
liue, which made him esteeeme the lesse of the losse of his life. But the
righteous considereth with himselfe, that he hath eternall yeares to loose,
<hi>I had those yeares still in my mind;</hi>

                  <hi>Num.</hi> 33.</note> Without Hope, what good
can man inioy? The diuell vsed all the tricks and deuices that his wit was able
to inuent, to put <hi>Iob</hi> out of hope: For which end he made vse of two
meanes.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Sathans pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise to depriue Iob of
  Hope.</note>The one he took from the earth, by procuring that those his
friends, on whom he most trusted, and hoped for greatest comfort from them,
should cast him downe, and driue him into despaire, by their bitter words and
sharpe censures.</p>
            <p>The other from heauen, by getting fire to descend from thence;
speaking in these two thus vnto him, What shouldst thou now doe but despaire
and die, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thou hast nothing to hope for either from heauen aboue, or
earth beneath. He hath not onely robbed mee of my leaues and my boughs, tearing
downe my branches, but hath rent vp my hopes by the rootes. And yet for all
this, saith patient <hi>Iob, Though he kill me, yet will I trust in him.</hi>
Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith, That God doth most of all resent the sinne of
desperation; Not because of all other sinnes it is the greatest, but because it
is most preiudiciall to man: for it shuts vp the passage to blessednesse, and
barres the doore of heauen against vs; God being more sensible of the hurt we
doe our selues, than of the wrong wee doe him. And therefore <hi>Iudas</hi> his
despaire did much more trouble him, than did his selling of him: for in selling
him, he did but shew what little reckoning he made of his Humanitie; but in his
despairing, the base opinion that he had of his Diuinitie. <hi>Vae illis</hi>
(as before) <hi>qui in viam Cain abierunt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi>
  4.</note> 
               <hi>Woe vnto them that haue followed the wayes of Cain.</hi> Now the
worst of those wayes that <hi>Cain</hi> tooke, was his despaire, <hi>Maior est
iniquitas mea, quam vt veniam merear</hi>; as if he should haue said, God
either cannot or will not pardon so grieuous and hainous a sinne as this is.
Yet we see, that God did permit, that he might lay some good ground for our
Feare, that one of the theeues should be damned: and that it is neither our
dying side by side with Christ, nor his bedashing vs with his diuine blood,
neither the prayer which he made to his Father with teares in his eyes, nor the
hauing of the image of a Crucifixe, or of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> hanging at
our beds head [but the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Christ in our hearts by Faith] could do this
theefe any good, or keep him from leaping at once from the Crosse vnto hell:
and yet he would that the other should be saued, not onely as he was a theefe,
and to finde pardon of that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular offence; as to lay a foundation for the
Hope of forgiuenesse, for all other sinnes whatsoeuer committed by vs in this
world, and to the end, that his abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution (as Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith)
and his indulgence might serue as a comfort to all Christians, For, as in
<hi>Adam</hi> we lost Paradise; so in the theefe we got it againe. Certaine
desperate fellowes vttered by <hi>Ezechiel, Our bones are dryed vp, and our
hope is perished</hi>: But God in answer sayes vnto them, I will open your
Sepulchres, and put life into those your drie bones; doe ye not therefore
despaire. And for the better ingrafting of this truth in his peoples hearts, he
raised vp a whole field that was full of these bones, &amp;c. <hi>Arnoldus</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>We indeed receiue things worthy of that we haue done, but this
man hath done nothing amisse.</hi> This whole Historie doth depend vpon these
foure points.</p>
            <p>The first point, are those motiues, which moued this Theefe to be
conuerted.</p>
            <p>The second, The great good hap that he had.</p>
            <p>The third, The diligence that he vsed on his part, that God might
pardon and fauour him.</p>
            <p>The fourth and last, The fauour that he did him, and the great
reward hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed vpon him.</p>
            <p>Amongst other Motiues, the first shall be the Title of the Crosse,
<hi>Iesus Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renus Rex Iudaeorum, Iesus of Nazareth King of the Iewes.</hi>
It was prophesied, That his Kingdome should take it's beginning from the
Crosse,<note place="margin">Motiues iudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the theefe to his
  conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</note> 
               <hi>Dominus regnabit à ligno.</hi> The Iewes did
secretly honour the word <hi>à ligno</hi>; The Saints did openly
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence it. Christ had giuen great pledges in his birth, that hee was
à King, by Angels, Shepheards, and Kings; In his life, by the obedience
of all sorts of creatures, <hi>Who is this whom the winds and seas obey?</hi>
By the voices of the Diuells themselues, by the whips of the Temple, and by his
last Supper. <hi>Here bee some standing here which shall not taste of death
vntill, &amp;c.</hi> In his passion. <hi>My kingdome is not of this world; and
ye shall see the Son of man comming in power.</hi> But in his death hee gaue
farre greater pledges. All the creatures gaue testimonie of their Creator; The
diuels cried out (so sayes <hi>Eusebius Caesariensis</hi>) <hi>Pan mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
interijt.</hi> And howbeit, on <hi>Pilats</hi> and the peoples part, the Title
of the Crosse was placed there in scoffe and scorne of him; yet the diuine
prouidence made vse of these liuing instruments. And as in the creation he
walked on the waters, so in the reparation of mankind, he passed through
punishments and paines; of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Christ, making their iests turne to
earnest: The same consideration being likewise to be had, concerning the
Crowne, the Scepter, and the Robe of purple, which in derision they put vpon
him, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hilarie</hi> and <hi>Bonauenture</hi> both say, That our
Sauiour Christs Patience, was one great Motiue; <hi>In heauen, the Father, the
Sonne, and the Holy Ghost beare witnesse;</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Io<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.</hi> 5.</note> 
               <hi>In earth, the Holy
Ghost, Water, and Blood:</hi> All these testimonies proue the Diuinitie of
Christ. But to let passe those of heauen; The Holy Ghost doth prooue that hee
was a Diuine person, whose voyce was so powerfull when the Spirit tooke his
leaue of his body, that it forced the Centurion to say, <hi>Vere filius Dei
erat iste,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mar.</hi> 15.</note> 
               <hi>Truely this man
was the Son of God.</hi> The Water (which was miraculous) prooues, that he was
a Diuine person; for it is not possible, that water should naturally flowe from
a dead body. The Blood, that prooues it, not onely in regard of it's muchnesse,
but that it was shed with so much patience. For though his wounds were many,
and his torments great, yet like a sheepe before the Shearer, he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer once
opened his mouth, or shew'd the least resistance. And <hi>Euthymius,</hi> and
<hi>Theophylact</hi> adde, That the prayer which he heard him make to his
Father, <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther forgiue them</hi>; (which was the first that he vttered on
the Crosse) did worke that amasement in this theefe, That he said with
himselfe, Sure this is no man: And thereupon began to haue an assured hope of
the forgiuenesse of his sinnes. For (thought he) he that is so desirous to
pardon those that had vsed him so cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly, not onely tormenting him in his
body, but also scoffing and flouting at him, to vexe (if it were possible) his
soule, will surely farre more willingly pardon me, who being heartily sorry for
my sinnes, desire to become his seruant. <hi>I haue heard that the Kings of
Israel are mercifull</hi>: but none of them all had so generous 
<pb n="622" facs="tcp:22083:332"/> and free a heart, as our Sauiour Christ.
<hi>Tertullian</hi> saith, That hee came into the world, for to shew himselfe a
God in his suffering; making Patience the badge and marke of his
Diuinitie.<note place="margin">Patience the badge of Christs Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie.</note>
And that the power which he shewed in pardoning, being so great; much greater
was that which hee shewed in suffering. It was much that he should suffer for
man, much more in that he suffered for man, when as man would not suffer him to
be God. To admit a Traytour to his boord, to bid him welcome, to feast him, and
make much of him, that finding himselfe so kindly vsed, he may make him
surcease from his plotted treasons, winning him vnto him by these and the like
courtesies, well may a man doe this; but that God should admit a <hi>Iudas</hi>
to his table, that he should eate with God, God wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, That he would goe
from the table to execute his treason, to sell God, and to deliuer him vp into
the hands of his enemies, onely God and his patience could suffer so great an
iniurie: which made Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> to say, <hi>A potentia discimus
patientiam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>S. <hi>Chrysostome, Origen,</hi> and S. <hi>Ierome,</hi> are or
opinion, That the alteration of the sunne and the elements, wrought the same
effect vpon the theefe, as it did vpon <hi>Dyonisius</hi> in Athens, when he
cryed out, Either the world is at an end, or this man is God. <hi>Vincent
Ferrariensis</hi> saith, That the shadow of our Sauiour Christ did inlighten
this Theefe. And that the shadow of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> healing bodies, it was
not much, that the shadow of Christ should heale soules. Whereunto may be
applyed that of <hi>Dauid, Thou hast shadowed my head in the day of
battaile.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Petrus Damianus</hi> saith, That the blessed Virgin might bee
a meanes of this Theeues Conuersion, by intreating her sonne, that he would be
pleased to open the eyes of his soule: Whether she were mooued thereunto,
because the good theefe did not reuile Christ, or whether (which Saint
<hi>Augustine</hi> reports, though some attribute the same to
<hi>Anselmus</hi>) That in her iourney to Aegypt, hee being Captaine of the
Theeues, did the blessed Virgin many good seruices, being much taken with the
prettinesse of the child, and the sober and modest counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the mother;
sure I am, that it was a happines so sole in the world, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of
such strange circumstances, That no man did, or euer shall enioy the like good
lucke. And as we cannot expect a second death of our Sauiour Christ; so such a
second happy incounter as this was, cannot bee hoped for. This Theefe came in
that good time, when as heauen did shoure downe mercies; when there was a
plenary Indulgence and Iubilee granted; when God did poure forth the balme of
his Blood for to ransome man; when the doores of heauen, and the wounds of
Christ were equally open; when the fountaine of liuing water, did cry out in
the middest of the world, <hi>If any man thirst, let him come vnto mee and
drinke</hi>; when our Sauiour had such a longing desire to see the fruit of his
labors and sweats; when he had put that petition to his Father, which began
with <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nosce illis, Forgiue them</hi>: And it seeming vnto him, That his
Father was too slow in granting his request, he did thus pittifully complaine
vnto him, <hi>O my God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> Why came I into
the world? Why was I borne in pouertie, liued in labour, and dyed in sorrow?
<hi>What? Haue I laboured then in vaine?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, it was his happinesse, (as Saint <hi>Gregory Nissen</hi>
hath obserued) That he inioyed our Sauiour Christs side, and his shadow; that
he was so close vnder his wing. He that sayles in a little Barke with a
powerfull Prince, as it succeeded vnto <hi>Iulius Caesar, Caesarem vehis, &amp;
fortunam eius,</hi> It is not much that he should be fauoured. Saint
<hi>Ambrose</hi> saith, That as long as <hi>Peter</hi> stucke close to Christs
side, he did set vpon a whole squadron at once; but when he was gone but a
little fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <pb n="623" facs="tcp:22083:332"/> off from vnder his wing, a silly maid
did out-face him, and made him turne coward. And when hee began to sinke in the
sea, because he was neere Christ, Christ stretcht out his hand vnto him to saue
him, whereas if he had beene but two strides further from him, he might haue
beene in danger of perishing. Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> stiles him, <hi>Collega
Christi, Christs Colleague,</hi> His fellow and companion. When one goes forth
into the field vpon a challenge, one girts his sword vnto him, another buckles
his armour, and others accompany him into the field; and if he get the
victorie, all doe share in the glory of the Conquerour. In that his combat in
the desart, the Angels did wait vpon him: In that combat of his death, an
Angell comforted him. The Theefe, he goes along with him for companie, and all
doe partake of his glory.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> saith, That he met with
another happinesse, to wit, That he dyed as Christ did, vpon the Crosse: God
hauing proposed heauen vnto vs in Conquest; onely he shall inioy it, that can
get it by force of Armes. But the Crosse doth excuse them this labour; For, it
being heauens key,<note place="margin">The Crosse is heauens Key.</note>
whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer shall come therewith, may enter without any violence; but others
must be forced to knocke, and that hard, at the gates, and it is well if with a
great deale of labour he can get in at last. Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> saith, That
the leagues which are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene earth and heauen, are without number; but he
that hath a familiar, let him bestride but a sticke, and with that woodden
horse he will trauell in two houres from Madrid to Rome: This vertue the Crosse
inioyes, with much more aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; doe but fasten your selfe to that, and in
an instant you shall be conueyed to heauen. And expounding that word, <hi>Dum
veneris in regnum tuum,</hi> this Saint saith, <hi>Et tum vidit, Then, euen
then did he see him</hi> taking his iourney for heauen, and said vnto him,
<hi>Lord remember me when thou commest into thy Kingdome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, it was his good hap to stand mainely then for Christs
honor, when in a manner all the world had forsaken him, <hi>Quando Petrus</hi>
(saith S. <hi>Chrysost.</hi>) <hi>nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat in terrae, Latro confitebatur in
Cruce, When Peter denyed him on earth, the Theefe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged him on the
Crosse.</hi> When <hi>Iudas</hi> (saith S. <hi>Ambrose</hi>) sold him as a
Slaue, then did the Theefe acknowledge him for his Lord. O my good Theefe
(saith S. <hi>Aug.</hi>) What couldst thou see in a man that was blood-lesse,
blasphemed, abhorred, and despised? What Scepter? what Crowne couldst thou hope
for from him, whose Scepter was a reede, whose Crowne thornes? &amp;c.
<hi>Dauid</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his son <hi>Salomon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">3.
  <hi>Reg.</hi> 2.</note> that he should shew kindnesse to the sonnes of
<hi>Barzillai</hi> the Gileadite, and cause them to sit downe and eat with him
at his owne table, because they stucke close vnto him in his tribulation.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, That he had the good happe to bee there iust in the nicke
when Christ was crowned with a Crowne of glorie, and had made this his wedding
day, and all things were ended according to his owne hearts desire: and
therefore so no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a bridegroome could not but conferre answerable fauours;
and so great and generous a King, do no lesse than bestow a Crown vpon him
<hi>Shi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ei</hi> railed against
<hi>Dauid,</hi> when flying from <hi>Absalon,</hi> he went halfe naked and
vnshod, by the skirt of a mountaine; but when the war was ended, he prostrated
himselfe at the Kings feet, and said, Let not my Lord impute wickednesse vnto
me, nor remember the thing that thy seruant did wickedly, when my Lord the King
departed out of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem, that the King should take it to his heart: for thy
seruant doth know that I haue done amisse. But <hi>Abishay</hi> the sonne of
<hi>Zeruiah</hi> answered and said, <hi>Shall not Shimei die for this?</hi>
because he cursed the Lords annoynted? Shall foure words of submission saue the
life of this blasphemous dog? But <hi>Dauid</hi> said, Shall there any man die
this day in Israel? <hi>Dost thou not know, that I am this day King ouer
Israel?</hi> 
               <pb n="624" facs="tcp:22083:333"/> Make account that they now crowne me anew,
and that it is fit that I should shew my selfe franke and generous, not
conferring fauours according to the merit of him that askes them, but according
to the liberall disposition of him that doth them.</p>
            <p>This good fortune no man may expect, much lesse depend vpon: and
therfore <hi>Eusebius Emisenus</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Repentance must
  not be delayed.</note> 
               <hi>Periculosum est in vltimum diem promissa
securitas</hi>; And that the example of the Theefe, doth not fauour deferred
amendment till a mans death: And though we are not to streighten Gods
franke-heartednes; and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit it may be presumed, that in that houre many
theeues are in Gods secret will saued; yet did he onely leaue this one publike
example vnto vs, Onely this one, (saith S. <hi>Bernard</hi>) that thou mayest
not presume; and only this one, that thou mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est not despaire. And weighing
those words, <hi>Verely, I say vnto thee, to day shalt thou be with me in
Paradise</hi>; he saith, That he did bind it with an oath, as he vsed to doe in
matters of greatest moment and difficultie: To thee onely, not to any other,
shall befall the like extraordinarie good hap; for thee onely, was this
<hi>Hodiè</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained. Here then mayest thou see the rarest accident
that euer hapned, earth and heauen reconciled, whilest riuers of Diuine blood,
run streaming from our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours side for our saluation.</p>
            <p>But some one will aske me, How comes it to passe, that this Theefe
in so short a space knew the set time and season of this his happy chance, when
as Ierusalem in so many yeares could not light vpon the like encounter? S.
<hi>Augustine,</hi> S. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome,</hi> and <hi>Leo,</hi> answer
hereunto; That he had Christ for his Master, who reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the same vnto him,
complying with that deliuered by <hi>Ieremie, De coelo misit ignem, &amp; eru
diuit me. Gregorie Nissen</hi> saith, <hi>Repleuit eum eruditione Spiritus
Sancti. Cromatius; In ipso crucis candelabro sol resplenduit, The Sun did shine
vnto him vpon the candlesticke of the Crosse. Theophilact</hi> doth here apply
that parable of Saint <hi>Mat. No man doth light a candle, and set it vnder a
bushell.</hi> In a word, this light was so powerfull, that it awakened this
drowsie and sleepie theefe, snorting in the secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of sin, leauing him so
well instructed, that S. <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, He remained as a Master in
the Church.</p>
            <p>First of all, he vsed extraordinarie diligence in taking hold of
this treasure, leauing all, that he might not loose this, <hi>He gaue God all
that was in his free power to giue him.</hi> He had his hands and his feet
nayled vnto the Crosse; onely hee had left free vnto him his tongue, and his
heart: imploying in Christs seruice, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer was in his freedome to
performe; as his tongue in defending him, and his heart in louing him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He did not stand waiting for the last plucks of Hope.
<hi>Emisenus</hi> saith, That it was not his last houre, but the first, wherein
hee knew his Sauiour Christ to be God. It is now sixtie yeares since (dearely
beloued) that some of you haue knowne him, and yet yee deferre your repentance
till the houre of your death.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, he confessed his sinnes, and how deseruedly he did
suffer, <hi>Wee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed receiue things worthy of that we haue done.</hi> For he
that will goe about to craue pardon for his sinnes, the first step to
forgiuenesse, is to accuse himselfe of them. <hi>Dauid</hi> entred in this way,
and the Prodigall, when they cryed <hi>Peccaui</hi>; so did the Publican,
<hi>Propitius esto mihi Peccatori.</hi> And the Wise man teacheth vs to get in
this way, <hi>Dic tu prius iniquitates tuas, vt iustificeris. Iustus in
principio sermonis accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sator est sui.</hi> Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> addeth,
<hi>Sui non alterius, He is his owne accuser, not another mans.</hi> Saint
<hi>Chrysostome,</hi> That if the Theefe had not confest the faults of his
life, he would neuer haue presumed to desire Christ to remember him in his 
<pb n="625" facs="tcp:22083:333"/> death. Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> That if <hi>Adam</hi>
had not sought to excuse himselfe, God would neuer haue thrust him out of
Paradise. Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> doth much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it, that our Sauiour
saying; One of you shall betray me; and prophesieng the bad end that he should
make, <hi>Iudas</hi> should not confesse his fault, but should so boldly vtter
as he did, <hi>Is it I Master?</hi> Hee should haue left out then <hi>Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid,
Is it I?</hi> and said, <hi>Ego sum, I am the man</hi>; then had hee not lost
heauen by a word. Saint <hi>Gregorie,</hi> That the Theefe neuer shewed
himselfe so subtill and so craftie in the office of theeuing, as now; for with
this his last theft, he repaired all the thefts of his forepassed life,
<hi>Alij latrones, latrocinio vitam perdunt, hic au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem latrocinio vitam f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

it a most discreet one.</p>
            <p>First of all, all mans happinesse doth consist in Gods hauing vs

<hi>Dauid</hi> askes the question, <hi>What is man that thou art so mindfull of
him?</hi> Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, That the second part of this verse is
an answer to the former. <hi>Qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The other, <hi>Quod memor es eius,</hi> His good continuance in

not desire that thou shouldst make me a free Denizen of thy Kingdome; nor that
thou shouldst honour me, as thou doest those that haue truly serued thee; but
only that thou wilt be pleased to remember, That though I do not dye here for
thee, yet I dye with thee: And that it grieues me to the very soule that I had
not known thee, that I might haue suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the torment of this Crosse in thy
seruice, and for thy sake, and that I might haue laid down my life, nay a
thousand liues, if I had had so many, for thy loue. O Lord haue therefore
mercie vpon me, and suffer me to suffer not onely so long as my life, but as
the world lasts, so that at last thou wilt but thinke vpon me.
<hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderabat</hi> (saith S. <hi>Augustine</hi>) <hi>facinora sua, &amp;
pro magno habebat, si ei, in fine mundi parceretur, He did throughly weigh his
owne wickednesse, and would take it for an excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding great fauour, that when
the world should haue an end, he might haue his sinnes forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen him.</hi> He
had happely heard that which our Sauiour Christ said, <hi>Videbitis filium
hominis, venientem in potestate, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Saint <hi>Gregorie</hi> doth discourse very wittily of the
Theologicall and Morall vertues of this Theefe. And beginning first with his
faith, he compares it with that of <hi>Abraham,</hi> of <hi>Esay,</hi> of
<hi>Moses,</hi> of the three Disciples, of <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> and
<hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaniel,</hi> with that of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and that of the
Canaanitish woman; and hee seemes to preferre it before all theirs: For, if
<hi>Abraham</hi> beleeued,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.</note> hee spake
with God in person, hee had many present fauours done him, and faire and ample
promises, of f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r greater future
blessings. If <hi>Esay</hi> beleeued, it was because hee saw him sitting in his
throne in great State and Maiestie,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Isay</hi> 6.</note>
garded round about with Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphins, which cryed, <hi>Holy, holy, holy is the
Lord of Hosts, the whole world is full of his glorie.</hi> If <hi>Moses</hi>
beleeued, it was because he beheld him in a flame of fire,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Exod.</hi> 5.</note> out of <pb n="626" facs="tcp:22083:334"/> the midst
of a bush, seeing the bush burne with fire, and yet the bush not
consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.</note> If the three Disciples
beleeued, it was because they saw him transfigured in Mount Tabor, in that
glorious manner, That his face did shine as the Sunne, and his clothes were as
white as the light; whilest a bright cloud shadowing them, they might heare a
voyce from heauen, saying, <hi>This is that my beloued Son in whom I am well
pleased</hi>; not betweene two theeues, but betweene two Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. If Saint
<hi>Paul</hi> beleeued, it was because he had been rapt vp to the third heauen,
and had seene strange sights, &amp;c. If <hi>Nicodemus</hi> and
<hi>Nathaniel</hi> beleeued, if the woman of Canaan, and many others, they were
mooued thereunto by the Scriptures, and by our Sauiour Christs myracles. But
this Theefe neither saw him in his offered fauours, nor in his Throne of
Maiestie, nor in the firie bush, nor transfigured in the Mount, nor knew any
thing of the Scriptures, nor of his myra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; onely he knew that
<hi>Iudas</hi> had sold him, that his Disciples had forsaken him, and that he
was reuiled and hated of the people, &amp;c. <hi>Et tanquam in gloria adorat,
And yet hee adores him</hi> (saith <hi>Chrysostome</hi>) <hi>as if hee were
alreadie in glorie. Videt</hi> (saith S. <hi>Augustine</hi>) <hi>in cruce,
&amp; rogat quasi sedentem in coelis, Hee sees him hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vpon the Crosse,
yet sues vnto him as if he were sitting in

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eauen. Huic fidei, quid addi
possit, ignoro. What more may be added to this Faith, I know not.</hi> Those
were wauering in their faith, which saw him raise vp the dead; and yet this
Theefe firmely beleeues, who saw him hang vpon the Crosse. <hi>Leo</hi> and
<hi>Eusebius Emis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senus,</hi> indeere this his beleefe. He did verily beleeue,
That our Sauiour Christ should rise againe; for hee would neuer haue made a
sute vnto him, whom he saw was a dying man, if he had thought there had been an
end of him. He as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suredly did beleeue the immortalitie of the soule, and looked
after another life; being more carefull thereof, than his fellow-theefe, who
desired only this tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral life; saying vnto Christ, <hi>Salua temetipsum
&amp; nos, If thou be that Christ, saue thy selfe and vs.</hi> This our good
Theefe beleeued that which Christ spake before <hi>Pilat, My Kingdome is not of
this world:</hi> Quite contrarie to those Apostles of his, who stroue for
chaires of preheminence, one desiring to sit at his right hand, the other at
his left, supposing his Kingdome to bee a temporall Kingdome.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">No more was his Hope.</note>Againe, His Hope
was no lesse great than his Faith, <hi>Quis credet ei, qui non ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet nidum,
&amp;c.</hi> Who will ground the hopes of his happinesse vpon that man, that
hath not a house to put his head in, nor a bed to sleepe in? yet this Theefe
had set vp his rest vpon him that had no resting place. Great was the hope that
<hi>Daniel</hi> had in the Lyons Den, but he there saw that the Lions did lick
the shooes on his feet, like louing Curs. Great was <hi>Aminadabs</hi>
confidence, who was the first that aduentured to set vpon the sea, and to enter
the deepe; but he had seen great prodigies in Aegypt. Great was that assurance
of <hi>Dauids,</hi> when being beset round on al sides by <hi>Saul,</hi> his
souldiers said vnto him, <hi>Transmigra in montem, sicut passer.</hi> But he
answered, <hi>Ego dormiui &amp; somnu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> coepi, surrexi quia Dominus suscepit
me,</hi> they would haue had him flye like a bird vnto the hill; But hee told
them, That hee would lay him down,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 4.</note>
and sleep in peace, for the Lord was his keeper, and would make him dwell in
safetie. He had such confidence in his God, that hee tooke no great care
concerning his enemies.</p>
            <p>Lastly, His Loue was no lesse great than his Hope, <hi>Loue</hi>
(saith <hi>Salomon</hi>) <hi>is as strong as death.</hi> But here Loue was much
more strong than death, for death was now scorned by Loue. They hung not him vp
vpon the Crosse for any loue that he bare to our Sauiour Christ; yet before he
dyed, he would haue giuen a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand liues to haue purchased his loue, and it
was a greater griefe &amp; torment vnto <pb n="627" facs="tcp:22083:334"/> him, that he saw
he was not crucified for Christ, than the Crosse it selfe was vnto him. So that
beginning to suffer like a Theefe, hee became to dye like a Martyr.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>To day shalt thou be with me in Paradise.</hi> Neuer did any
  former ages see a fauor comparable vnto this.</p>
               <p>First, in regard of that which heauen is in it selfe; being that
  next vnto the hypostaticall vnion, it is the greatest good that the
  omnipotencie of God can giue vs. All other good leaueth vs still hungry; this
  onely affoordeth fulnesse, <hi>I shall be satisfied when thy glory shall

  their <hi>vltimum bonum, Desire the fruition of God, as their chiefest
  feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie.</hi> But because they neither know what God nor heauen is, they
  haue scarce peept in with their heads within the doores of that Supreame
  Princely Pallace, but that they are rauished with that strange and vnspeakeable
  admiration, that blessing themselues, they breake out in this manner; This
  surely is God.<note place="margin">The glorie of the heauenly Paradise.</note>
  Their weake apprehension not being able to conceiue the least glorie of that
  great Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, so that <hi>Esay</hi> might very well say, <hi>I am found of
  those that seeke not after me.</hi> The capacitie of our conceit, and the
  modell of our imagination, is but a thimblefull, in respect of that immense
  Ocean of Gods greatnesse. And therefore true is that saying, That the Iust doth
  finde that which hee doth not seeke for. And if the crummes which fall from
  that diuine Table, doe robbe a man of his vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, banish all other
  thoughts from him, and doe as it were alienate him from himselfe, how will he
  be transported, when he shall drinke at the fountaine of that riuer of
  delights, and when God shall say vnto him; <hi>Open thy mouth wide, and I w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

  greatnes of this good, That God suffers him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to be rob'd by the labours
  and sweats of man. When we buy a thing dog-cheape, we vse to say it is stolne.
  Put in one scale, fastings, almes-deedes, sacke-cloth, and ashes, the torments
  of Martyrs, the troubles of Confessours; and in another scale, one houre, nay
  one minute of heauen, and in reason of buying and selling, heauen is robbed by
  vs. And hereunto doth allude that phrase in Scripture, <hi>Et violenti rapinus
  illud; And the violent take it by force.</hi> Now then, that after so many
  thefts, robberies, deaths, our Sauiour Christ should grant so great a good to
  this Theefe, a greater fauour cannot be imagined.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in regard of the aduantage he had of others. We know,
  that in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, some shall enioy more, some lesse, <hi>As one starre d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

  eternal glorie, but not all the same degrees in glorie. But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider I pray
  you the great aduantage that this Theefe made; for he held it to bee a great
  happinesse vnto him, if God would be but pleased to afford him any the least
  corner of heauen. <hi>Abbot Arnaldo,</hi> a graue and antient,
  Authorhathaduentured to say, That God had giuen him the chaire wherein
  <hi>Lucifer</hi> sate. S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> saith, <hi>Quid tu Domine amplius
  Stephano contulisti? &amp;c.</hi> Oh Lord, what could that Proto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>martyr Saint
  <hi>Stephen</hi> inioy more, or that thy beloued Disciple which did leane his
  head in thy bosome? And (as <hi>Cirillus Ierosolimitanus</hi> saith) What could
  the long seruices of those that endured the heate of the day, obtaine more at
  Gods hands? But God makes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this answer, <hi>I do not thee no wrong, didst
  thou agree with me for a pennie?</hi> Some labourers were working hard at the
  Vineyardfrom the first houre; others from the third houre; others began at the
  ninth houre; others whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the sunne was vpon setting. First came <hi>Adam,</hi>
  then <hi>Noah,</hi> after him <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the rest of the holy
  Prophets: but the Theefe came iust at the Sunne-setting.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="628" facs="tcp:22083:335"/>Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> saith, That the
  same day that <hi>Adam</hi> was cast out of Paradise of the earth, the same day
  did this Theefe enter into the Paradise of heauen. The word Amen, or verely,
  doth imply as much. Aniently the Tribes were diuided &amp; set apart vpon two
  hils; the one breathing forth curses, <hi>Cursed is he that honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not his
  Father, Cursed is he that leadeth the blind out of the way</hi>: the other
  blessing; <hi>Blessed be thou in the Citie, blessed in the field, &amp;c.</hi>
  Onely the difference was in this, That to these their maledictions and
  cursings, they did euer say Amen. For (as it is in the Prouerbe) <hi>Para el
  mal sobraua pann<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> For ill, there was neuer yet cloth wanting; there was
  stuffe still enough ready at hand. But to their blessings, they answered with
  silence, reseruing their Amen, or, So be it, for the comming of our Sauiour
  Christ, from whom all our good was to come. And <hi>Theodoret</hi> giues vs
  this note withall, That those that silenced their Amen, were those that were to
  be fathers vnto Christ, according to the flesh.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, in regard that this fauour is made the greater by it's
  quick dispatch, <hi>Hodie mecum eris in Paradiso, To day shalt thou be with me
  in Paradise. Theophylact</hi> and <hi>Tigurino,</hi> read, <hi>Amen, dico tibi
  hodie,</hi> Making there the point. But this ought not to be receiued, as
  <hi>Cassianus</hi> prooueth it, but that this <hi>Hodie</hi> must goe hand in
  hand roundly along with <hi>Mecumeris.</hi> And <hi>Iustin Martyr</hi> saith,
  <hi>Iuxta fluenta plenissima, gratiam simul accepit &amp; gloriam, Grace and
  glorie with a full tyde, came flowing in both at once vpon him.</hi> S.
  <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith, That our Sauiour Christ made this excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding great
  haste, <hi>Ne dilatione gratia minueretur, Lest the fauour he intended to do
  him, should be lessened by delay.</hi> This fauour farre exceeding all the rest
  in the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides; As that of <hi>Alexander</hi> towards <hi>Perillus,</hi>
  demanding a dourie of him for his daughter; and that of the Gardiner, who had

  must not giue slowly: for the willing mind wherewith it is done (being therein
  the most to be esteemed) it looseth much of it's estimation by it's slow
  proceeding. <hi>Leo</hi> the Pope saith, That it was a great fauour from
  Christ, to put this so humble and so discreet a petition into the Theeues
  heart; but a farre greater fauour to giue him such a good, and quicke dispatch.
  <hi>Ioseph</hi> foretelling <hi>Pharaohs</hi> seruant of his libertie, being

  remembrance with thee, when thou art in good case</hi>: But for all the others
  faire promises, he continued two yeares after in prison. But the Theefe had no
  sooner said <hi>Memento mei,</hi> but his Sauiour saw him dispatcht. O happy
  theefe, thou didst negotiate well, and with a good Iudge, that could dispatch
  thy businesse so quickly, and so well.</p>
               <p>Lastly, in regard of it's bountie and freenesse, the reward
  outvying the request; hauing more fauour done him than he desired.<note place="margin">His reward exceeds our requests.</note>

  <hi>Iudith</hi> craued <hi>Bethulia's</hi> liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, God gaue her that, and
  <hi>Holofernes</hi> head into the bargaine, and victory against
  <hi>Nebuchadnezzar. Anna</hi> prayed for a sonne, God gaue her one, that was a
  Saint, a <pb n="629" facs="tcp:22083:335"/> Prophet, &amp; Gods fauourite. <hi>Salomon</hi>
  desired wisedome to gouerne his kingdome the better, he had that and much more,
  besides infinite store of wealth bestowed vpon him. <hi>Ezechias</hi> sued vnto
  God for life, and whereas he would haue bin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with two years holding
  of it, God granted him a lease of fifteen yeares to come. The seruant that owed
  10000 Talents, desired to be but forborn for a time, and the whole debt was
  forgiuen him. But God neuer dealt so franke and freely with any man, as with
  this theefe, for he but only intreating him to be mindful of him, he gaue him
  heauen, <hi>Qui merita supplicum excedis &amp; vota,</hi> sings the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Theophylact</hi> saith, That your Kings, Princes, and great
  Captains, when they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine any notable victorie, they reserue the principal
  captiues for their Triumph: So <hi>Saul</hi> spared King <hi>Agag,</hi> and the
  best things: so the Emperors of Rome, <hi>Zenobia</hi> and others:
  <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Vespasian,</hi> most of the young men of Iudaea. But
  that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Christ should enter in triumph into heauen with a theefe, it
  seemeth a thing of small glory to the Triumpher, and little honor for heauen.
  But <hi>Abbot Guericus</hi> answers hereunto, That it was a new and most noble
  kind of victorie, <hi>Nouum &amp; pulcherrimum genus victoriae.</hi> The kings
  of the earth get victories ouer their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, by treading them vnder, by
  kicking and spurning of them, by contemning and tormenting them, as appeareth
  by Histories both humane and diuine: This is a tyrannous kind of reuenge, and
  reuengefull cruelty. But that of the King of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen is a noble reuenge, and a
  sweet victorie. The enemies of a king of this world will kisse the earth for
  feare; but those of the King of heauen, for loue. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is said,
  <hi>Inimici eius, terram lingent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againe, S. <hi>August.</hi> saith, That Christ did inrich and
  illustrate heauen with the person of this theefe; so far was he from doing him
  any the least dishonor. For it is a great honour to heauen to haue such a Lord
  and Master, as shall make of great Theeues, great Saints. S. <hi>Chrysost.</hi>
  hath the same, and further addeth, That by seeing one raigne in heauen, who
  wanted earth to liue on; euery man may liue in hope to inioy the like
  happinesse: For it is not likely that he will be miserable to any, that was so
  liberall to a theefe.</p>
               <p>The Doctors do doubt whether this Theefe were a Martyr or no?
  For he that is a Martyr, it is not the greatnesse of the paine, but the
  goodnesse of the cause that makes him a Martyr. <hi>Achan</hi> was stoned to
  death, and Saint <hi>Stephen</hi> was stoned to death: But <hi>Achan</hi> was
  no Martyr, because he dyed deseruedly for his sins. The like reason you will
  say may be rendred of the theefe. But S. <hi>Ierome, Eusebius Nis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senus,</hi>
  and S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> stile him Martyr; not because he suffered for Christ,
  though he suffered not without Christ; but because suffering with Christ, so
  great was the sorrow which he conceiued for his sinnes, that Christ taking this
  his torment to his account, as if he had suffered for his loue, made of the
  Crosse a Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. S. <hi>August.</hi> saith, That on the Crosse he
  acknowledged Christ, as if he had beene crucified for Christ. <hi>Eusebius
  Nissenus,</hi> That albeit he began with the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of a Delinquent, yet
  he ended with the glory of a Martyr. And S. <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> That Christ did
  conuert the blood which he shed vpon the Crosse, into the water of baptisme,
  and that presently he placed him in Paradise.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iustin Martyr</hi> and <hi>Irenaeus</hi> vnderstand here by
  Paradise, some other place of ioy; but rather earthly than heauenly.
  <hi>Irenaeus</hi> prooues it by the Priests of Asia. But it is most certain,
  That by Paradise is to be vnderstood, the blessed presence of our Sauiour Iesus
  Christ. And that he went from the Superficies of the earth, vp to that heauenly
  Pallace, &amp;c. To which God of his great goodnesse bring vs all, Amen.</p>

question, How a man can buy without a price, or sell without money? And his
answer is, That in buying and selling betwixt man and man, there must of force
some bargaine be driuen, some price proposed; but with God it is not so, for,
all that which we can buy, is from God. In the world, he that buyes, remaines
with that which he buyes, and hee that sells, with the price thereof. God sells
heauen vnto vs for our fastings, our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and our teares; and heauen, and
the price thereof, remaines at home within our selues, and in our owne keeping.

                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.</note> 
               <hi>He rested from all his worke which he
had made. Rupertus</hi> saith, That when the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture maketh mention, That
God walked vp and downe in Paradise; it speakes of God after the manner of man,
who when he hath ended all his businesses, sits him downe to eate, takes his
rest, and gets him afterwards out to walke in his garden, there to take his
pleasures as one that hath now nothing else to do. So that when God was al
alone, he had some houres of his own; but after that he had once made himselfe
man, all those houres, were made ours. In token that he who beareth on his
shoulders the burthen of a Common-wealth, ought not to account so much as an
houre to be his, but that they are al allotted for other men. Those that now
adayes gouerne the world, make many houres their owne; They must haue their
houre to eate, their houre to sleepe, their houre to talke, their houre to
play, their houre to walke, making their gouernment a matter of recreation,
ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting all care behind their backe, and neuer so much as once thinking of
their obligation. And whereas they should be in continuall occupation, vsing
their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations sparingly; they change lots, as if gouernment were conferred
vpon them, to sit still and doe nothing, at least to follow their pleasures and
delights, whence great hurt doth accrue to themselues and others.</p>
            <p>To themselues, because God will not call them to account for those
houres, wherein they did not game, walke, &amp;c. but for those, wherein they
did not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch businesses.</p>
            <p>To others, because thou art not thine owne man, but art to spend
thy time for the good of those that God hath committed to thy care, to receiue
their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations, to peruse their petitions, and to giue a speedie dispatch
to their iust pretensions. For what hurt they receiue through thy default, it
is put to thy account.</p>
            <p>Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> saith, That such Offices and places as
these, are not for weake men, effeminate persons, and such as are giuen to
sports and pasttimes; the weight of this charge is great, and therefore had
need of a strong backe, or the shoulders of an <hi>Atlas.</hi> It being so, How
comes it then to passe, that so many doe desire and hunt so earnestly after
these great places? My answer is, because they looke not vpon the weight and
perill thereof, but the pompe and estimation that waits vpon them. Saint
<hi>Augustine</hi> saith, That if worldly honours bee taken for ease, there is
nothing more sweet, nothing more pleasing, <hi>But with God, nothing more
miserable, more wretched, or more damnable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now when Iesus knew that his houre was come that he should
depart out of this world, vnto the father, for as much as he loued his owne
that were in the world,</hi>
               <note place="margin">No loue like to that of our
  Sauiour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs.</note> 
               <hi>[vnto the end he loued them.]</hi> So farre was
Christ from repenting himselfe of his loue towards his, that he gaue them all
possible pledges of this his loue. Great is the loue and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection that a
Theefe hath to theeuing, insomuch, that though he know he shall be hanged the
next morning, yet he takes pleasure in robbing. A fine delicate lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer is he,
who knowing that to morrow he shall loose his life for his loue, lasheth out
into greater extreames of loue than before. Many at their first entrance into
loue, promise many sweet contentments to themselues, who if they had but
thought what sower sauce they should haue to this their sweet meat, they would
neuer haue made loue. But our Sauiour Christ saw his death before his eyes, and
yet that he might perfect his loue when his houre was come, he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more and
more loue still. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, That hee tooke flesh in the
Virgins wombe, that he might receiue limbs and members from thence, to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb n="632" facs="tcp:22083:337"/> them vp to the crueltie of the Crosse: As a head, to
haue it crowned with thornes, a face to be spit vpon and buffeted, a mouth to
be distasted with vinegre and gall, hands and feet to be bored and nayled, a
side to bee pierced. And though hee knew that this his loue to mankind, was to
bring all this torment and miserie vpon his sacred person, <hi>In finem dilexit
eos, Vnto the end hee loued them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The neerer his death grew, the greater grew his loue. That
comparison of the riuer is not much amisse, which takes it's head or beginning
from a small foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and by little and little goes increasing, till in the
end it seemes to be a Sea. We cannot say that there was any thing little or
small in our Sauiour Christ: but in some sort, taking from his infancie, it may
comparitiuely bee thus vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, His loue was little at the first, it began
to purle forth in those his teares in the cratch; it went on, drawing more
water in his Circumcision; in his exile into Aegypt, in his fastings, prayers,
penitences, sermons, myracles, and when hee came to wash his Disciples feet,
and to giue vnto them his body and blood, then was it full sea with him. The
Iewes did put this question, <hi>How can this man giue vs his flesh to be
eaten?</hi> Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> tells vs, I will tell you how; In the
begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was Loue, &amp; that Loue was with God, &amp; God was that Loue; and
this may serue as an answer to all questions that may be demanded in this kind.
And as in all other things from his childhood, he went (to our seeming) growing
vp still more and more; so did his loue likewise goe dayly increasing, euen to
the houre of his death, shewing that he loued vs vnto the end. When a mountaine
takes fire, at first the fire is but small, but by degrees growes greater and
greater, till it comes at last like another Aetna to be a mountaine of fire.
<hi>Ieremy</hi> saith, That he saw a seething pot, The pot by little and little
comes to take heat, till at last it falls a boyling, but the fire vnder it may
be so great, that it may bubble and runne ouer, throwing out all that is within
it. In our Sauiour Christs breast, the fire of his loue did alwayes seeth and
boyle apace, but in the end this fire grew to so great a flame, that it threw
out that his flesh, and made that his blood to ouerflow which was knit to his
soule, and Diuinitie. That man which <hi>Ezechiel</hi> saw in the first chapter
of his Prophesie, one with his feet standing vpon a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyre, who was all fire;
but from the head to the girdle, the fire was secret and hidden; but from the
girdle downward, euen to the very feet, all was on a bright flame. His feet
stood vpon a Saphyre, which is the colour of heauen, to shew vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs the
blessednesse which he did inioy from the very instant of his concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as
also to signifie vnto vs, that all the life of our Sauiour Christ, was a
flaming fire of Loue. But in those his younger yeares, it was for a while as it
were smothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and repressed, but afterwards brake forth into those flames,
that when his houre was come, and that he was to dye, <hi>Those whom he loued,
he loued vnto the end.</hi> Some haue sayled ouer the whole Mediterranean, haue
toucht vpon the coasts thereof, and entred vp into it's riuers; Others haue
past the Streight, and arriued at the <hi>Cape de buena Esperance, of good
Hope.</hi> There was a man that rounded all the world, as if he had stood in
competition with the Sunne; but for all this, his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uagation was not at an
end. Euery day more countries are discouered: but in the sea of Loue there is
not that place, which the Ship of the Crosse hath not sayled into, <hi>Omnis
consumptionis vidit finem, &amp; in finem dilexit eos, He saw the end of all
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption, and loued them vnto the end.</hi>

               <note place="margin">Three kinds of

               <hi>Aristotle</hi> sets downe in his Ethicks three kinds of

            <p>
               <hi>Honestum, Vtile, Iucundum.</hi> That is, grounded on Honestie,
Profit, and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>
            <p>That which is grounded vpon profit, will cease, when that ceaseth:
Thou hast a <pb n="633" facs="tcp:22083:337"/> friend, that furnisheth thee with moneyes;
no longer furnish thee, no longer a friend: So sayes <hi>Seneca</hi> in an
epistle of his to <hi>Lucilius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That which is founded vpon pleasure and delight, liues or dyes, as
those de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights liue or dye in vs.</p>
            <p>But that which makes Honestie it's ayme, that endureth for
euer.</p>
            <p>My friend (saith <hi>Seneca</hi>) I ought to loue him so well, as
to follow him in his banishment, to releeue him in his necessities, and if need
were to dye for him. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, that <hi>Seneca</hi> liued
in the time of the Apostles, and that it is very probable, that he had some
communication with Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and that the Apostle related vnto him
what our Sauiour Christ did for his, That he accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied them in their
banishment, inricht them with the riches of heauen, and in the end layd downe
his life for them. This is that, <hi>In finem dilexit eos, He loued them to the
end.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A great loue can neuer indure a long absence. <hi>Theodoret</hi>
saith, That Saint <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> hauing heard from Christs owne mouth, a
<hi>Ter me negabis, Thou shalt denie mee thrice,</hi> He would faine haue fled
many Leagues from that occasion; but that his loue was so great, that he held
it a lesse ill to denie him, by following him, than to confesse him by flying
from him. He tooke so much pleasure in his presence, that he chose rather to
hazard the losse of his soule, than of his beloued sight: Holding it a lesse
vnhappinesse to denie, than not to be in the eye of him, whom he loued so
dearely. Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> treating of that petition which <hi>Moses</hi>
made vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, <hi>Either blot me out of the booke of life, or spare this
people,</hi> giues vs this note out of that place; That so great was the loue
which the Prophet bare to that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that albeit God did offer him to be
chiefe Gouernour ouer a farre better and greater people, yet could he not
endure to be diuorced from them, nor to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent himselfe from their companie,
and therefore made choise rather of this so sad and grieuous a resolution,
<hi>Aut dele me de libro vitae, &amp;c.</hi> ô Lord either pardon them,
or condemne me: My loue towards them can better abide death, and hel, than
their absence. <hi>Plut.</hi> saith, That Loue is like Iuie, which if it cleaue
but to a stone, or an old wall, will rather dye than forsake it. Christ said
vnto his Disciples, <hi>Vnlesse I goe hence, the comforter will not come vnto
you</hi>: All their felicitie consisting in the comming of the Holy Ghost; But
<hi>I goe to prouide a place for you.</hi> Nobody but I, can open the gates of
heauen vnto you. Our Sauiour said, <hi>Lift vp your gates ô ye Princes,
&amp;c.</hi> Where S. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> obserueth, That it had beene
sufficient, had he but onely said, <hi>Open the gates.</hi> But he did not say,
<hi>Open, but, take the gates away,</hi> heaue them off the hookes. For heauen,
that is neuer shut against any, hath no need of gates. His Disciples might haue
said vnto him; Lord, since we shall receiue so great a good by thy departure;
<hi>Fuge, assimulare Caprae, hinnulo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que ceruorum.</hi> Yet so great was their
loue vnto him, that with teares in their eyes, they desired rather their owne
hinderance, than his absence. Many nations of the world made their gods
prisoners, chaining them fast with strong yrons; For, in seeing themselues to
bee forsaken by them, they presently accounted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues but dead men.
<hi>Pausanias</hi> reporteth, that the Lacedaemonians had tyed fast the Statue
of <hi>Mars</hi> with cords of silke. And <hi>Alexander ab Alexandro</hi>
saith, That <hi>Hercules</hi> was bound fast with fetters of gold. And
<hi>Plutarch</hi> in his Problemes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counteth the like of <hi>Apollos</hi>
Image. And the sacred Scripture deliuers vnto vs, That <hi>Micas</hi> the
Idolater followed with teares in his eyes, those theeues which had stolne away
the Idols belonging to his house, or his houshold gods. And <hi>Laban</hi> vpon
the like occasion, pursued <hi>Iacob.</hi> For it is impossible, that any bodie
should suffer or endure the absence of his God. Two powerfull Loues therefore 
<pb n="634" facs="tcp:22083:338"/> wrestling and strugling in the breast of our Sauiour
Christ: The one, to returne to his father from whence he came; The other, not
to depart from his Spouse here on earth; his Loue did lay a plot how he might
goe away, and yet stay. And this was the vpshot of his Loue.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>When the diuell had now put in the heart of Iudas,
&amp;c.</hi> It is noted by Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> That at the same time as our
Sauiour Christ was busied about the performing a point of that so meeke and
lowly a humilitie, as his washing of his Disciples feet, and communicating vnto
them his body and blood; the very same time did the diuell enter into
<hi>Iudas</hi> his breast. Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> addeth, <hi>Admirans,
dixit; That the Euangelist spake this, as it were in the way of admiration; Cum
diabolus misis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set in cor, When the diuell had put it in his heart,
&amp;c.</hi> Our thoughts are like grauell stones got into the shoo, which
Satan puts into mans heart, and made such hast to thrust them into
<hi>Iudas</hi> his heart, that he was much perplexed and troubled there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
some few dayes: but the batterie continuing, he fell at last to a finall
reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, and when he was resolued what he would doe, himselfe made the
offers of selling our Sauiour Christ. <hi>Quid vultis mihi dare? What will you
giue me?</hi> In which sale of his, two notable follies are to be noted.</p>
            <p>The one, His selling of his Sauiour vpon trust. S. <hi>Marke</hi>
and S. <hi>Luke</hi> say, <hi>They promised to giue him money.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other, His selling of him at so low a rate, standing to their
curtesie what they would giue him. The diuell offered our Sauior Christ all the
whole world. But <hi>Iudas</hi> was so base, That he went away well contented
with three Blanks, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing willing to play at small game rather than to sit out.
For he that is a couetous wretch, euen with the diuell himselfe looseth his
credit. And therefore the Church stiles him a very Pedlar, the basest and worst
of merchants. <hi>Iudas mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator pessimus.</hi> Saint <hi>Gregorie</hi> saith,

               <hi>Gregorie Nazianzen</hi> saith, That in selling our Sauiour
Christ, hee lost all the right and claime that he had to his blood: for no man
can challenge any right to that which he sells; so that he did vtterly renounce
all kind of remedie, or anie soule comfort whatsoeuer.</p>
            <p>Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> saith, That by committing treason against
the Lord both of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and earth, he had so highly offended therein, that
neither of them, would giue him any reception or entertainement at his death;

               <hi>When the diuell had put it in his heart.</hi> There are some
sinnes so foule, and so enormious, that for to cease vpon them, a man had need
to haue <hi>Iudas</hi> his heart, and the diuells hands. He that is weake and
fraile, may sinne out of a naturall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, or some long continued
custome, and euery occasion will be sufficient to make him flye after his game,
as the Hawke doth after hir prey, &amp;c. But to doe ill to him that doth vs
good, we had need of the helpe of a <hi>Iudas,</hi> or a diuell.

               <hi>Ioseph</hi> being woed by his wanton Mistrisse told
her, <hi>Quo modo potero.</hi> Being bound vnto my Master with so many chaines
of his loue and kindnesses towards mee, How can I doe him so great a wrong?
<hi>Saul</hi> was much more beholding to <hi>Dauid,</hi> than <hi>Ioseph</hi>

               <hi>He layeth aside his vpper garments.</hi> S. <hi>Ierom</hi> in

There is nothing of more power and command, than loue.<note place="margin">Loue

               <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> leauing ouer the gouernment of Aegypt vnto <hi>Ioseph,</hi>
said vnto him, <hi>Without thee shall no man lift vp his hand, or his foot in
all the land of Aegypt.</hi> It may seem that God said the like to Loue, who
drew God downe from heauen to liue here vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth? It was Loue, who led him
along through the streetes to Mount Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarie, triumphing there ouer his power:
It was Loue, and onely loue. O Loue, if thou be so imperious, as to triumph
ouer God himselfe, Who shall bee able to resist thee? <hi>Absque tuo imperio,
&amp;c.</hi> Without this Loue, we can neither stirre hand nor foot, no not
breath, or liue one houre.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He layeth aside his garment.</hi> Well did he repay that kind
loue of theirs, in ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting their clokes before his feet, when he road in
Triumph through Ierusalem, carrying palmes in their hands. And he in stead of
washing the palmes of their hands, disdained not to stoope so low as to wash
their feet. Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> saith, That the Spouse did complaine, that
the Gards of the Citie had taken her cloake away, <hi>Tollerunt pallium
meum:</hi> Do not ye therefore complaine if ye bee stripped starke naked for
Gods sake, since he was pleased to lay aside his garments to doe you
seruice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He began to wash the Disciples feet.</hi> He had said
before,<note place="margin">No humilitie like our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours.</note> 
               <hi>Knowing
that the Father had giuen all things into his hands.</hi> And <hi>Hilarie</hi>
addeth, <hi>Etiam proditorem.</hi> So that God hauing put Christ into
<hi>Iudas</hi> hands, Christ puts himselfe vnder <hi>Iudas</hi> his feet. O
<hi>Iudas</hi> (saith he) though thou hast giuen thy heart vnto the diuell, yet
I pray thee giue me thy feet, that I may bath them with the tears of mine eyes,
<hi>Thou hast put all things vnder his feet,</hi> The birds of the ayre, the
beasts of the field, and the fishes of the sea. This is much: But if God should
haue reuealed vnto thee, that thou shouldst see his sonne washing
<hi>Iudas</hi> his feet, &amp;c. <hi>And there appeared a great wonder in
heauen, a woman cloathed with the Sunne, and the Moone was vnder her feet.</hi>
Heauen being to cloth her, what could it cloth her better withall, than with
the Sun and the Moone? But a greater wonder is it, to see the Son of heauen
vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Iudas</hi> his feet. O heauens, are ye not ashamed to see those
hands which created you, which did border you about with light, as with a rich
imbroyderie, to be soi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the foulenesse of such feet? For to looke her
lost groat, the good wife swept her house ouer and ouer, turning and sifting
this and that other heape of dust, leauing no corner vnsearcht, till she had
found it. God hath two houses:<note place="margin">God hath two

            <p>He did turne the first vpside downe, when he kneeled on his knees
to wash <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> feet. Saint <hi>Ierome</hi> saith, <hi>Quantumcunque te
humilies, humilior Christo non eris, Be thou neuer so humble, Christ will be
more humble then thou canst be.</hi> For hee will put himselfe vnder thy feet,
As he did here stoupe to <hi>Iudas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O Lord, for so forlorne a soule, which must be lost at last, so
much paines for so little profit, so much lost labour for one that is lost.</p>
            <p>First of all, a Fathers care ouer his sicke sonne, to whom hee
beareth loue, is farre different from that which the Physition takes, who onely
cures him <pb n="636" facs="tcp:22083:339"/> for his owne priuat profit and particular
interest.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Because Loue can neuer bee subdued; where it findes one
lost, it thinkes all lost. At the Wedding there was but one found vnfitted for
his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Yet this inference was made vpon it, <hi>Many are called, but few
are chosen.</hi> Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, That one is a great losse,
where there is great Loue: and with the losse of <hi>Iudas,</hi> Loue was so
much agrieued, that Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith, That the freeing of the
Theefe out of the Deuills hands, was done in reuenge of the losse of
<hi>Iudas.</hi> The Deuill was much ioyed that he had robbed our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of
such a friend, as one of the Twelue; but he had beene as good let him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
for he lost a Theefe when he was vpon the Gallowes, and thought he was sure
then his owne. <hi>Plus amisisti, quam rapuisti, Thou lost more than thou
gotst</hi>; thou robst God of a Theefe, that had beene thine but a few days;
and he robbed thee of another theefe, which had beene thine for many
yeares.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He began to wash, &amp;c.</hi> Being to bestow vpon them his
bodie and bloud, hee thought fit first of all to begin with the making cleane
of their feet, by which the Scripture vnderstands, our defects and foulenesse
of our affections, in token of that disposition and preparation wherewith we
are to come to the receiuing of so diuine a Sacrament. All the whole life of
our Sauiour Christ was a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne of pouertie, and that in the highest degree.
The portall wherein hee was borne, was hung with Cobwebs in stead of Tapistrie;
the Cratch and a locke of Hay, were the sheet and pillow to his cradle; al the
whole space of his life, he had not a place where to leane and rest his head:
his death was vpon Mount Calua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, a place full of dead mens sculls and bones,
whose bodies had suffered by the sword of Iustice. But for the institution of
this diuine Sacrament, he had made choice of a goodly large Hall, well
furnished, and handsomely set forth; and for the consecration of the Wine, a
Cup made (as some thinke) of a costly Agat, which is offered to be seene in the
<hi>Asseo</hi> of Valencia.</p>
            <p>First, to signifie vnto vs, That gold, siluer, and pretious
stones, are on nothing so well bestowed as on the seruice of God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That he that sits downe at this sacred Table, must come
accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with great riches of vertue,<note place="margin">The holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
  not to be receiued, but with a great deale of preparation.</note> and great
purenesse of conscience. To your great and solemne banquets, those that are
inuited come thither in a sumptuous and gallant kind of manner, your Romans did
cloath themselues all in white, for they held such an inuitation

               </gap>o sacred a thing, that it was held
a great shame and infamie to any that should fully the same with any kind of
deceit or treason. The Gospell condemned him that came vnto the marriage
without his wedding garment. Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> saith, That we ought to
please those Diuine eyes, euen with our outward habit. Saint <hi>Hierome</hi>
tells vs, That when he had dreamed in the night any dishonest dream, he did
tremble &amp; quake for feare when he entred into Gods House.
<hi>Abulensis</hi> reporteth, That the cause of <hi>Oza's</hi> death was, for
that hauing laien that night with his wife, he presumed to touch the Arke. The
Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Councell doth admonish vs, That they who are to communicate, ought
to abstaine eight dayes from conuersation with women. The same aduice is giuen
vs by Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> and Saint <hi>Hierome</hi>: and it is a strange
Doctrine to my see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,<note place="margin">No preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on sufficient for the
  Holy Supper.</note> That he that is to say Masse euerie morning, should spend
the nights with his she-friend, <hi>Let euerie man first trie and examine

&amp;c.</hi> so that a man either must examine himselfe, or must not; If he
must let him weigh his worthines and vnworthines; if he shall find himselfe
vnworthie, <hi>he must rather excommunicate &amp; remoue himselfe from the
Altar.</hi> Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, That one of the mainest reasons why
our Sauiour <pb n="637" facs="tcp:22083:339"/> Christ at his last supper, possessed with
such perturbation the brests of his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, telling them, That he that dipt
his finger with him in the dish should sell the Sonne of Man and betray him,
was, That euery one might be affraid of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and might say not without
some suspition and iealousie, <hi>What Master is it I?</hi> For there is no man
so Holy, no man so Pure and free from sinne, but it will well beseeme him to
come wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h a great deale of respect

<hi>Iob</hi> when he sat downe at the table vsed to fetch a sigh, <hi>Antequam

eat. Did these good men hold themselues vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of that materiall bread; What

<hi>Dionisius, de Ecclesiastica Hierarchia; Clemens Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> in his
Apostolicall Constitutions; <hi>Hilary, Theodoret, Datianus Alexandrinus,</hi>
hold (contrary to the opinion of the Saints) that <hi>Iudas</hi> did not then
and there communicate with the rest.</p>

               <p>Saint <hi>Austen</hi> sayth, That Saint <hi>Peter</hi> first

  great modestie of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> who was not so much astonished to see
  Iesus Christ at the feet of <hi>Iudas,</hi> as to see him at his own feet. All
  the complements which <hi>Peter</hi> vsed with our Sauiour Christ, are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
  commendation, full of discretion, reuerence, and loue: Onely his default was,
  That hee would striue and contest with our Sauiour Christ, for want of true
  knowledge of those ends, whereunto Christs actions were directed. So that if
  mannerlinesse may bee a fault in any man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it was now in <hi>Peter,</hi>
  for refusing to haue his feet washt; the mysterie whereof had he but knowne, he
  would not haue made so nice a matter of it.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Cyrill</hi> treating of the ends of this act of our
  Sauiors, saith, That he desired by all means possible to ingraft Loue in Mans
  brest; &amp; to giue vs to vnderstand, That without great humilitie, there can
  be no great Loue. <hi>Guarricus</hi> saith, That our Sauior Christ did loue man
  so wel, yea, &amp; in such a maner of fashion, that he resolued with himself to
  iumpe &amp; agree with him, &amp; to shape himself according to his humour, and
  to doe any thing whatsoeuer, though neuer so meane, so as it might make for his
  good. And when he saw that Man was so proud, that he would not submit himselfe
  to serue him, he sayd, Well, seeing Man will not be brought to serue mee, I
  will submit my selfe to serue him, &amp; stoupe to so low and so base a

which with so sad a spectacle, and so woful a sight, would not loose somewhat
of i'ts fiercenesse and violence; leaning himselfe against the window, and
looking wistly vpon him, he breathed forth these two words; <hi>Ecce homo.</hi>
Behold here a Man (sayth S. <hi>Austen</hi>) fitter for the graue than a
throne; yee did heretofore enuie him for the great applause which the world
gaue vnto his Miracles, but now his Miserie may blot that out of your
brests.</p>
            <p>First, I would haue yeto consider, what manner of thing Man was
when hee was moulded by the hands of God in the Creation; how rich, how wise,
and how perfect a creature he was. In his Incarnation, in what a prosperous
estate did he liue, how mightily enuied by Hell? In the Resurrection, how
glorious, and how immortall? And how God againe by the hands of Man, is mocked,
scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, spit vpon, and contemned.</p>

that a Preacher of the Gospell, whose dutie it is to preach Christ cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
should say vnto Christian people, <hi>Ecce homo, Behold the Man.</hi> No man
will trust the pittie and compassion of an enemy. <hi>Saul</hi> remained much
amazed and confounded, when <hi>Dauid</hi> stole from his beds-head his speare
and his pitcher; and when in the caue he had cut off the lappet of his garment;
and with tear did propound and promise to himselfe to loue him and fauour him

allay the furie of those billowes which grew stil rougher and rougher in the

from so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed an enemie: yet hee that is a Christian hath our Sauiour
Christ to bee his Friend, his Lord, his Father, and his God. And representing
himselfe vnto vs in this pitifull and lamentable manner, what heart is there so

  so many miseries, behold Gods greatnesse. <hi>Zacharias</hi> doth paint out
  Iesus the Priest with loathsome and vnseemely garments, and that a stone with

  may behold this with admiration (if it were possible that God could be subiect

  admire the ensignes of the Crosse. And to God, the Sonne said; <hi>My God, my
  God, looke vpon me.</hi> In a word, if there be any thing that may cause a
  generall astonishment, and admiration in all creatures whatsoeuer, it is our
  Sauiour Christ crucified. The flood was a cause of great amasement, beholding
  the waters, the heauens, and the dead bodies. The burning of Sodom, and the

  <q>We <hi>Pontius Pilat</hi> by the will of the immortall gods,
 and by the authoritie of Roman Princes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing President of this sacred Empire,
 condemne vnto death, Iesus of Nazareth, for hauing made himselfe King of the
 Iewes, as appeareth by the testimonie of the High Priests of Ierusalem.
 Wherefore we will and command, that he be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed from this place, forth of
 the Citie, to the place of Execution, commonly called Golgotha, and there to be
 crucified betweene two theeues, <hi>Dismas</hi> and <hi>Gismas,</hi> here
 conuicted and condemned for their thefts and robberies, to the end that this
 his death may make for the good and safetie of this people, and for the
 peaceablenesse of this Common wealth. Dated in Ierusalem, in Lithostratos,
 vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly <pb n="641" facs="tcp:22083:341"/> cald the Pauement, <hi>Pasquo parasceuae,</hi>
 or Preparation of the Passeouer, about the sixt houre.</q>
               </p>
               <p>No age, euer knew a more cowardly Iudge, or a more vniust
  sentence.<note place="margin">Pilat a cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly Iudge.</note>
               </p>
               <p>First, because hauing said in publike, <hi>Ego nullam in eo
  inuenio causam, I find no cause of death in him</hi>: and thereupon, washing
  his hands before the multitude, he made protestation, That he was innocent of
  the blood of this iust man: God not suffering him to haue a mouth to say the
  contrarie.</p>
               <p>Secondly, because the innocencie of our Sauiour Christ, was
  notorious; not onely because all the Prophets had giuen sufficient testimonie
  thereof, <hi>Huic omnes prophetae testimonium perhibent</hi>; but the people,
  <hi>Bene omnia fecit. Pilats</hi> wife, <hi>Iudas,</hi> the Diuels, and the
  President himselfe, who (as <hi>Sixtus Senensis</hi> reports) writing to
  <hi>Tiberius Casar,</hi> confessed, That the High Priests had accused him out
  of enuie; and that by the common voyce and consent of the people, he had
  deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered him vp to their will, against the testimonie of his owne
  conscience.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Because both the Iudge, and the Accusers, did proceed
  against him contrary to all Law and Iustice.</p>
               <p>First, by receiuing those as sufficient witnesses against him,
  which in all right and equitie, ought not to be admitted, <hi>Sciebat, quod per
  inuidiam tradidissent eum.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cap. Testes, q.</hi> 3.
 <hi>Leg. Vaius. §. de quaest. Testium vltro accusandi, non est

                  </note> And which was more, offering themselues to bee
  witnesses, contrary to the Law, <hi>Vnius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, because no Iudge can condemne any, vnlesse he himselfe
  confesse, or be conuicted of the fact that is laid against him; whereas our
  Sauiour Christ was not onely innocent of any crime, but in right of law
  likewise, because no man could conuince him of sinne; for although he was
  falsely accused, yet was he not conuicted. And when the Iudge knowes, that the
  accused is innocent, he ought strictly to examine the witnesses, seeking
  occasion to free him; as <hi>Daniel</hi> did in the case of <hi>Susanna</hi>:
  but <hi>Pilat</hi> was willing to winke at the matter, albeit he saw well
  enough, that the testimonies were not conuenient and fitting. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
  Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith of him, That he washed his hands, but not his
  heart. He did likewise swallow downe one circumstance of great consequence; to
  wit, a new Edict of <hi>Tiberius Caesars,</hi> wherein expresse commandement
  was giuen (as <hi>Suetonius</hi> sets it downe) That the chastisements of death
  should not be put in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution, till tenne dayes full and compleat after
  publication of sentence: But <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat</hi> made a short come-off with our
  Sauior, and gaue him a quicke dispatch. This sentence did surpasse all the
  vniust sentences that euer were pronounced. That of <hi>Iezabel</hi> against
  <hi>Naboth</hi>; That of the Iudges of Babylon against <hi>Susanna</hi>: For
  these had some forme of a Legall proceeding. But of this <hi>Esay</hi> saith,
  <hi>De medio iudicij sublatus est, generationem illius, quis enarrabit?</hi>
  Another letter hath it, <hi>Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum illius.</hi> It is a bad world, when an
  innocent person shall bee put to the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Crosse, without
  sufficient witnesses to condemne him, or without lawfull hearing, in
  discharging himselfe of such things wherewithall he is char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. But as Saint
  <hi>Gregorie</hi> saith, <hi>Si ipse indebitam mortem non suscepisset, nunquam
  nos a debita morte liberasset, Had not he vndergone an vndeserued death, hee
  could neuer haue freed vs from a deserued death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Christ being thus deliuered vp to the damnable will of those,
  who desired to put him to death, and the cruellest death that Tyrannie could
  inuent, they threw a halter about his necke, and laid a most heauy Crosse vpon
  his tender shoulders, and being garded along the street by the Roman
  Cohorts,<note place="margin">Feare and Iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie, spurred vp the Iewes to
 crucifie Christ.</note> they carry him away to Mount Caluarie. Their Feare and
  Iealousie, prompting them to take this course with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="642" facs="tcp:22083:342"/>First, That he might not as heretofore
  escape their hands.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That in case he should escape their hands, the Temple
  should not serue his turne. For, as <hi>Gellius</hi> doth affirme in his
  <hi>Noctibus Atticis,</hi> Those that were condemned to carry their Crosse, had
  not the benefit of taking San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuarie.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Because the death of the Crosse was so infamous a
  death, that none but theeues and traytors to the Common wealth, could bee
  condemned to this shamefull kind of death. And this (as S. <hi>Chrysostome</hi>
  hath noted it) was confirmed by the authoritie of Rome.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Because they would euen then presently put him to
  begin his suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. For, it was a common ceremonie amongst them, that they
  who were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to death, should haue a napkin fastned before their eyes,
  least by seeing the Executioner, and the instruments of death prepared for
  them, they might chance to fall into a swound, or faint in the way. But they
  would that Christ, to grieue him the more, should haue his punishment set
  before his eyes.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, The diuine prouidence (saith Saint <hi>Augustine</hi>)
  had so ordered it; for it was very fit and conuenient, that the Crosse which
  Kings vse to weare on the tops of their Crownes and Scepters, and Knights of
  diuers noble Orders on their breasts, That the Prince of heauen should first
  beare the same vpon his shoulders, conuerting thereby the greatest infamie into
  the greatest glorie that euer was in this world: so that that which on the one
  side was a sad and heauie sepctacle, on the other is a great and glorious
  mysterie.</p>
               <p>The people making a confused noyse, the Trumpets send forth a
  hoarse voice, the drums a dead sound, the theeues go cheeke by iole close to
  our Sauiors side, the cryers lift vp their voyces, and ball out aloud; 
  <q>This is the Iustice, which the Emperour of Rome, and
 <hi>Pontius Pilat</hi> in his name, with the consent and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of the
 Princes of Ierusalem, hath commanded to be done vpon this man, as a seditious
 person, a blasphemer, an impostor, a broacher of new erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious doctrine,
 stil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ng himselfe the Messias and
 Sauiour of the world, the King of Israel, and the Sonne of God.</q>
               </p>
               <p>He had to Mount Caluarie (according to the testimonie of some
  graue Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours,<note place="margin">Mount Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarie why so called.</note> which
  haue measured out that space of ground) 1021 paces, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to somewhat
  more than 3000 feet. And it was called Caluarie, either from the sculls of
  those that had beene there put to death, (as Saint <hi>Ierom</hi> would haue
  it) or from the scull of <hi>Adam,</hi> who was buryed there; of which opinion
  is the glorious <hi>Athanasius, Basill, Origen, Tertullian,</hi> and Saint
  <hi>Augustine:</hi> To the end that it might be there more especially verified,
  <hi>Sicut in Adam, omnes mori<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ntur,
  ita in Christo omnes viuificabuntur, As in Adam all men were dead, so in Christ
  all men shal be quickned and restored to life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Diuine Prouidence had likewise so ordered the businesse,
  that the place where our Sauiour Christ was to die,<note place="margin">Christ
 suffered in the midst of the world.</note> should be in the midst of the world.
  And howbeit some Doctors doe not admit, that it is in rigour and strictnesse
  iust in the middle, according to a Geometricall proportion or Mathematicall
  ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, yet most doe agree in this, that it was in the midst of the land of
  Palestine, (as it seemeth to <hi>Iosephus</hi> in his third booke, <hi>De bello
  Iudaico,</hi> as also to <hi>Aristeus</hi>) Or it may be said to be in the
  midst of the world, <hi>Per Priuilegium, By way of Priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> Because
  that was the place where God had shewed his greatest miracles. And of this
  mind, is venerable <hi>Bede:</hi> yet notwithstanding of great force is that
  place of <hi>Dauid,</hi>

                     <hi>Psal.</hi> 74.12.</note>
                  <hi>Operatus est salutem in medio terrae, He hath wrought saluation in the

  in the midst of the nations and countries that are roundabout her.</hi> As also
  the authoritie of Saint <hi>Ierome,</hi> who expounding this place, tearmes it,
  <hi>Meditullium terrae, &amp; vmbilicum</hi>; The very nauill or middle part of
  the earth. Which opinion is strengthened by S. <hi>August.</hi> discoursing on
  the 75 Psalme.</p>
               <p>Of the manner of their crucifying of our Sauiour Christ, there
  is this and that doubt made, and one more probable than another. The common
  receiued opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Saints, is, That the Crosse being fixed in Mount
  Caluarie, they hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him vp first with cords, and afterwards nayled him
  therunto. And so seemeth it good to that sacred Doctour Saint
  <hi>Gregorie,</hi> Saint <hi>Bernard,</hi> Saint <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and the
  reuelation of Saint <hi>Bridget</hi> confirmes the same. But Saint <hi>Ierome,
  Anselme, An<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>toninus,</hi> and <hi>Laurentius Iustinianus</hi> say, That the
  Crosse being laid all along on the ground, they first nayled him vnto it, and
  afterwards reared it vp. And this part is much fauoured for two reasons.</p>
               <p>The one, Because it was a more fitting and facile way to be
  done.</p>
               <p>The other, Because in the Holy Land there is an especiall place
  to bee seene, where they nayled our Sauiour Christ, which is a little wayes off
  from the place where the Crosse was set vp. But take which opinion you will,
  the plaine truth is, That it was one of the cruellest torments which our
  Sauiour Christ suffered; for they hauing first nayled his right hand, they did
  so stretch and straine the si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes, that they were forced with cords to draw
  out his left hand at full length, to make it meet right with that hole which
  was bored in the Crosse for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. And because they might stretch it
  out so far, that the nayle that fastned the right hand, might breake the flesh,
  and teare the sinewes, they were faine like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to bind his right arme with
  cords to the Crosse. And with this so violent a force and extreame reaching of
  his armes, the bones of our Sauiour Christs bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die were so dislocated, and
  disjoynted, that you might plainely tell them; that prophesie of that Kingly
  Prophet <hi>Dauid,</hi> being then verified, <hi>Dinumerauerunt omnia ossa mea,
  They numbred all my bones, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hilarie</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Christs nay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, the
 cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest part of his Passion.</note> That our Sauiour Christ gaue here
  greater signes of his sorrow and griefe, than in all the rest of those bitter
  passages of his passion. And <hi>Rodulph,</hi> and Saint <hi>Bridget</hi>
  affirme, That of all other his torments, this was the greatest. And it is a
  thing worthy our consideration, That our Sauiour Christ should bee more
  sensible of this nayling of his hands, than of that Crowne of thornes which
  they platted on his head, those cruell stripes wherewith they scourged him, and
  that vinegre and gall which they gaue him to drinke. Wherof there are two
  reasons rendred.</p>
               <p>The one naturall, which <hi>Thomas</hi> toucheth vpon.
  Deliuering vnto vs,<note place="margin">Two reasons proouing him more sensible of
 this tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than any other.</note> that so intollerable is the paine and
  anguish of the sinewes, that many that were crucified, through the extreamitie
  of the paine, did swound and were depriued of their senses. And therefore our
  Sauiours torment must needes be so much the more, by how much his wounds were
  greater than theirs. <hi>Foderunt manus meas, &amp; pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des meos. Hugo
  Cardinalis</hi> doth ponder the Metaphor of <hi>foderunt,</hi> Hee doth not
  say, <hi>Clauarunt,</hi> but <hi>effoderunt:</hi> Like one that digges a pit in
  the earth.</p>
               <p>The other, morall, because he held vs in his hands: And
  therefore it is said, <hi>Omnia tradidit Pater in manus suas, &amp; non rapiet
  eas quisquam de manu sua, The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath deliuered all things into his hands,
  and no man shall snatch any thing out of his hand.</hi> And in token that he
  was more sensible of our torments than his own, the greatest paine he felt, was
  in the nayling of his hands. <hi>Leo</hi> the Pope saith, That to those that
  were crucified, they did vse to put a vayle or bend before their eyes, 
  <pb n="644" facs="tcp:22083:343"/> when their hands were nayled, and that they tooke the
  like course with our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Christ, but his Loue had so ordered the
  businesse, that he had eyes to see his owne hurts, but not ours. The Prophet
  <hi>Zacharie</hi> askes the question, <hi>Quae sunt plagae istae, in medio
  manuum tuarum? What are those wounds in the midst of thy hands?</hi> The like
  question he might as well haue made of the wounds in our Sauiors side, and his
  sacred feet, but that Man was abiding in those the wounds of his hands, <hi>In
  manibus meis scripsi te, I haue written thee in my hands</hi>: And therefore
  made more reckoning of them. And at the day of iudgement he saith by the mouth
  of <hi>Zacharie, Aspicient ad me, quem crucifix<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Zachar.</hi> 12.</note> The sinner shall open his eyes, whose
  name being written (like a posie) in those hands, and himselfe worne by them,
  as a ring of remembrance, shall see his saluation nayled to those hands, which
  his sinnes had nayled so fast to the Crosse. In a word, as in the garden,
  hauing more care of his, than himselfe, he said in an imperious kind of manner,
  <hi>Sinite hos abire, Suffer these to depart.</hi> And on the Crosse he said
  vnto his Father, <hi>In manus tuas Domine, commendo Spiritum meum.</hi> Vpon
  which place Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, That he there called the
  faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, his Spirit and his Soule; taking no care of his owne spirit or
  soule; for that was vnited to the Diuinitie. So that in this regard, for that
  he held vs in his hands, he felt more the torment of his hands, than of any

               <p>Neuer did humane Nature receiue so great an iniurie as the death
  of the Crosse. <hi>Tostatus</hi> expounding that place of <hi>Deut. Maledictus
  a Deo, qui pependit in ligno, Cursed is he that hangs vpon the tree,</hi>
  saith, That it was an iniurie done to God himselfe, that a creature created
  after Gods owne image, should dye on the Crosse, <hi>Nefas est</hi> (saith
  <hi>Cicero</hi>) <hi>vincire ciues Romanos, scelus, verberare, prope
  parrici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium necare: Quid dicam in cruce agere? It is a hainous act to bind a
  Citizen of Rome, a villanie to scourge him, and in a maner paricide to kill
  him: What shall it be then to put him on the Crosse? Pliny</hi> saith, That the
  Romans did set vp certain Crosses, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they hung those dogges, which did
  not giue warning by barking; when the Gaulus did scale the Capitol; which
  surprisal was preuented by the gaggling of the geese. <hi>Suidas</hi> saith,
  That when any one did die a bad and vnfortunate death, they did put a Crosse
  vpon his graue. <hi>Scaliger</hi> reporteth, That vpon a time, there was a
  strange kind of headach in Rome, which had spread it selfe ouer all the Citie,
  which was so extreame painefull vnto them, that many of them did hang
  themselues in their owne garters, chusing rather to die, than to endure the
  paine thereof; and some did hang themselues for feare of that sicknesse, before
  euer it had seised vpon them: Whereupon the Senat being desirous to preuent so
  great a mischiefe, published a Proclamation, punishing therein these desperate
  offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders with the infamie of the Crosse, that dishonour might cut off that
  inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience, which life could not persuade. Now so great then was the loue
  which our Sauiour Christ bare vnto vs, that he deposited in the infamie and
  reproch of the Crosse, all that honour which hee had gotten himselfe by his
  myracles, his doctrine, and vnblameable life, leauing them all hanging on the
  Crosse, as a Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie of his loue. <hi>Hercules</hi> erected pillars, where hee
  thought the world had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and extended it's vtmost bounds, as a Trophie of
  his prowesse and valour; bearing this letter or inscription, <hi>Non plus
  vltra.</hi> Our Sauiour Christ shewed his Loue vnto vs to the end, in that his
  Trophie of the Crosse, with this letter or inscription, <hi>No Loue can goe
  beyond this Loue:</hi> And therefore the Crosse is the North-starre of our
  comfort and hope. For what can hee denie vs, or what will not he grant vnto vs,
  who on the Crosse shewed such exceeding great loue vnto vs? But some man
  perhaps will aske me, How can so bad a thing be able to afford 
  <pb n="645" facs="tcp:22083:343"/> comfort? Saint <hi>Basil</hi> cleeres it with this
  answer, That the death of our Sauiour Christ did alter the nature and qualitie
  of things; turning ioy into sorrow, and sorrow into ioy. And therefore it is
  said, <hi>Vae vobis qui ridetis, Woe be vnto yee that laugh.</hi> And as we see
  sometimes that the fire doth not burne, that the water doth not drowne, and
  that wild beasts doe not bite; because the diuine Omnipotence doth truck and
  exchange the actiuenesse of those Elements, and beasts; so Christ tooke away
  the sorrow &amp; paine of the Crosse, and placed thereon Ioy, Comfort, and
  Hope. The daughters of Ierusalem went forth to see King <hi>Salomon</hi> with
  that Crowne wherewith his mother had crowned him on his wedding day, and the
  day of the ioy of his heart. But <hi>Theodoret</hi> demandeth, How can a crowne
  of thornes become a crowne of ioy? I answer, As it is a crowne of Loue it may.
  <hi>Nilus,</hi> in an Epistle which hee writeth to <hi>Olimpiodorus,</hi>
  Proconsull of Aegypt, saith, speaking of the Crosse, <hi>Per hanc desperabundis
  vndique spes annuntiatur,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Euery part of Christ affords a
 sinner confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> 
                  <hi>To him, to whom (in all seeming) there remaineth
  no reason of hoping, the Crosse promiseth hope.</hi> There is no man so bad, no
  man so sad, to whom this doth not assure ioy and comfort. Consider Christ from
  the sole of the foot, to the crowne of the head; and all that we there find,
  are nothing else but reasons of confidence, and of comfort. His head bowing,
  his hands broken, his feet fettered, his side ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: with his head he beckens
  vs to him; with his armes he imbraceth vs; with his breast he doth warrant vs
  safetie. The heart of man is inscrutable. There were many that murmured at mans
  making, because hee that molded him, had not made him with a window in his
  bosome. But though thou shouldest be iealous of all the rest, yet canst thou
  not be iealous of Christ, nor of his Loue, since that he layes open his bowells
  vnto thee.</p>
               <p>They had now set vp the Crosse, leauing our Sauiour Christ naked
  thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as alreadie hath beene deliuered vnto you. And that Historie of the
  King of Aragon, <hi>Don Alonso,</hi> further addeth, That the most blessed
  Virgin being sensible of the great shame which her beloued Son suffered vpon
  this occasion, and desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring much to couer him with the vaile which she had on
  her head, the earth hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued it selfe vp by degrees, &amp; serued in stead of a
  ladder to performe this good of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. And though the Euangelists do not set
  downe all the particulars that passed then and there, yet this is so singular
  in it selfe, that I thought it not fit to haue it left out.</p>
               <p>Vpon the discomfort which Christ shewed in some few words that
  he vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,<note place="margin">Christs Deitie more concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at his death than
 a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny time before</note> the Diuells made a great muttering and whispering
  amongst themselues, that he was a meere man and a sinner. And hauing gone
  alwayes on in their blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, in not knowing of him, at this last push they
  bewrayed their blindnesse more than euer heretofore. <hi>Eusebius
  Caesariensis</hi> saith, That albeit all the whole life of Christ was a
  couering, and discouering of the treasure of his Diuinitie; yet at his death he
  did hide it in that manner, and kept it so close, that innumerable Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of
  Diuells came to flout and scoffe at him, as if they had now gotten the
  vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie; so doth that place of <hi>Esay</hi> expresse this their triumphing
  ouer him, <hi>Infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus super te, conturbatus est in occursum aduentus tui,
  suscitauit tibi Gigantes</hi>: by whom he vnderstands the diuells, which said
  to our Sauiour Christ on the Crosse, <hi>Et tu vulneratus es, sicut &amp; nos,
  &amp; nostri similis factus es, detracta est ad inferos superbia tua,</hi> Thou
  hast hitherto deceiued vs, but now thou shalt cosin vs no more, wee know now
  well enough what thou art: We will now be Gods, <hi>Super astra Dei, exaltabo
  solium meum, &amp; similis ero altissimo,</hi> Thou wouldst faine likewise haue
  made thy selfe a God, but thou art wounded and infected as well as we, with
  sin. Now thy eyes waxe dimme and darke, thy face pale and wan, thy tongue
  furred <pb n="646" facs="tcp:22083:344"/> and swolne; thy lips blacke and blew; and thy
  whole body nothing from top to toe but stripes and goare blood.
  <hi>Caesarius,</hi> that was a Contemporarie of Saint <hi>Bernards,</hi> saith,
  That he did aske a certaine Diuel, from whence he came? And that he should make

  capite, &amp; maceriae re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsae</hi>; like vnto a wall that is pusht and
  shov'd at; For, as some setting their shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders against a wal, and seeking by
  maine strength to throw it down to the ground, they themselues vsually fall
  with it, which thrust it downe, one remaining with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an arme, another without
  a legge, and some without their liues: So the Iewes and Romans, setting to
  their shoulders to ouerthrowe the life of our Sauiour Christ; one lost his
  Kingdome, another his Monarchy, this man his goods, that man his life, &amp;
  many both their bodies and soules. This is that <hi>Interficitis vniuersi
  vos;</hi> And as that speare which <hi>Saul</hi> threw did not touch
  <hi>Dauid,</hi> but smote the wal; So the nailes, wounds, scourges, and thornes
  toucht our Sauiours Humanitie, but not his Diuinitie. So that the speare which
  was flung at him, missing his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, <pb n="647" facs="tcp:22083:344"/> and hitting
  onely his Manhood, the Deuill was thereby taken, mocked, ouerthrowne, amazed,
  and astonished. In <hi>Exodus,</hi> God beeing willing to giue an end to the
  plagues of Aegypt, he commanded that euerie family of the children of Israell
  should on a certaine night kill a Lambe, and that they should sprinkle the
  posts of the doores of their houses with the blood thereof; and, that when the
  Angell should passe by, slaying the first borne of Aegypt, he should skip ouer
  the posts that were sprinckled with the blood of the Lambe, which the
  Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites that night had eaten to supper. S. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> saith, That
  the Angell did feare the blood of that Lambe, because it was a type and figure
  of that true and most innocent Lambe, who was to haue his blood sprinckled on
  the posts of the Crosse. If then an Angell of God were affraid of the blood of
  a beast, because it was a figure of that blood which was to be shed on the
  Crosse for the sauing of sinners, and such as were Gods chosen people; What
  feare and terrour shall the blood and death of our Sauior Christ, God, and Man,
  strike into Hell? Saint <hi>Paul</hi> sayth, <hi>Triumphans illos in semetipso,

  But now hee would get himselfe a name, and fame, by dying himselfe on the
