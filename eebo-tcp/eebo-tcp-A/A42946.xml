            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>THomas Merkes,</hi> a Monk of <hi>Westminster,</hi> was made Bishop of <hi>Carlisle</hi> by the Pope, at the Request of King <hi>Richard</hi> II. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no 1397. against the liking of the Chapter, and consecrated the same Year; who being entred upon his Charge, shewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self not unworthy of his Office: For besides that he is commended for his Learning, and his no small Prudence, he is celebrated, and that not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deservedly; in the first place for his singular Faith and Constancy towards his Patron K. <hi>Richard;</hi> as likewise for his famous Magnanimity, that without any Fear he boldly professed his Loyalty, not without great and manifest Danger, when he might honestly have held his peace, and ought to have done so, if he had regarded onely his own safety.</p>
               <p>There were some of the Nobles who did not desert the Cause of that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Prince, till he was Prisoner to his Rival, <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caster.</hi> But this Prelate despising the danger that hung over himself, would not desert the King, even when he had some while before deserted himself; but durst manfully defend the King and his Cause, when he had lost his Power and Interest, and when he certainly might conclude, that no sort of Benefit could redound to the King, but Ruine might befall himself thereby.</p>
               <p>At that very time when the mad multitude, always excessive in their Passions, not content to have deposed King <hi>Richard,</hi> and placed <hi>Henry</hi>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:53293:2"/>
of <hi>Lancaster</hi> (their Darling) in his Throne, but with their Clamours see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to extort from the Parliament, that they might deal yet more severe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the King; and there were not wanting some in the Parliament it self, who cast out dark and ambiguous Speeches of putting him to death; this Bishop then was not affraid to pronounce, That there were none there present, who had right to proceed to Iudgment against the King, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> as their lawfull Prince they had obeyed twenty two Years.</p>
               <p>Some few Heads of this Speech being onely related by Bishop <hi>Godwin,</hi> the whole is therefore, without any alteration, (Spelling excepted) here printed from Sr. <hi>Iohn Hayward's</hi> Book.</p>
               <p>When the Inheritance of the Crown was settled on K. <hi>Henry,</hi> and his Line, it was moved in Parliament, what should be done with King <hi>Richard?</hi> In answer to which the Bishop of <hi>Carlisle</hi> declared as followeth.</p>

                  </gap>, both to our particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, and also to the common State: Theresore before you resolve upon it, I pray you call to your considerations these two things: First, Whether King <hi>Richard</hi> be sufficiently deposed or no. Secondly, Whether King <hi>Henry</hi> be with good Iustice or Iudgment chosen in his place. For the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> point, we are first to examine, Whether a King, being lawfully and fully instituted by any just Title, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> upon imputation either of Negligence, or of Tyranny, be deposed by his Subjects. Secondly, What King <hi>Richard</hi> hath omitted in the one, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> in the other, for which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> should deserve so heavy Iudgment. I will not speak what may be done in a popular State, or in a consular; in which although one bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the name and honour of a Prince, yet he hath not supreme power of Majesty; but in the one the People have the highest Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, in the other the Nobility and chief Men of Estate; in neither the Prince. Of the first sort was the Commonwealth of the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonians,</hi> who after the Form of Government which <hi>Lycurgus</hi> fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, oftentimes fined, oftentimes fettered their Kings, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times condemned them to death. Such were also in <hi>Caesar's</hi> time the petty Kings of every City in <hi>France,</hi> who were many times ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned

upon Life and Death, and (as <hi>Ambicrix,</hi> Prince of the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odienses,</hi> confessed) had no greater Power over the People, than the People had over them. Of the second condition were the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Emperours at the first; of whom some, namely, <hi>Nero</hi> and<note place="margin">Tranquil. in Calig.</note> 
                  <hi>Maximinus,</hi> were openly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> now the Emperours of <hi>Germany,</hi> whom the other Princes, by their Aristocratical Power, do not only restrain, but sometimes also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move from their imperial State. Such are also the Kings of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi> and <hi>Sweveland,</hi> who are many times by the Nobility <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, either into Prison or Exile. Such likewise are the Dukes of <hi>Venice,</hi> and of some other sree States in <hi>Italy;</hi> and the chiefest cause for which <hi>Lewis</hi> Earl os <hi>Flanders</hi> was lately expelled from his place, was for drawing to himself cognisance in matters of Life and Death, which high Power never pertained to his Dignity.</p>
               <p>In these and such like Governments, the Prince hath not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> Rights, but is himself subject to that Power which is greater than his, whether it be in the Nobility, or in the common People. But if the Sovereign Majesty be in the Prince, as it was in the three first Empires, and in the Kingdoms of <hi>Iudaea</hi> and <hi>Israel,</hi> and now is in the Kingdoms of <hi>England, France, Spain, Scotland, Moscovia, Turkey, Tartaria, Persia, Ethiopia,</hi> and almost all the Kingdoms of <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Africk;</hi> although for his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

All Laws do exempt a Mad-man from punishment, because their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are not governed by their Will and Purpose: and the Will of Man being set aside, all his doings are indifferent; neither can the Body offend without a corrupt or erroneous Mind; yet if a

Mad-man draw his Sword upon his King, it hath heen adjudged to deserve death. And lest any man should surmise that Princes, for the maintenance of their own Safety and Sovereignty, are the onely Authours of these Iudgments, let us a little consider the Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns and Precepts of holy Scripture. <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> King of <hi>Assyria,</hi> wasted all <hi>Palestine</hi> with Fire and Sword, oppugned <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi> a long time, and at last expugned it, slew the King, burnt the Temple, took away the holy Vessels and Treasure; the rest he permitted to the Cruelty and Spoil of his unmercifull Soldiers, who defiled all places with Rape and Slaughter, and ruinated to the ground that flourishing City: After the glut of this bloudy Butchery, the People which remained he led captive into <hi>Chaldaea,</hi> and there erected his golden Image, and commanded that they which refused to worship it, should be cast into a fiery Fornace.</p>
               <p>What Cruelty, what Injustice, what Impiety is comparable to this? And yet God calleth <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> his Servant, and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth<note place="margin">Ier 25. 9.</note> him Hire and Wages for his Service: And the Prophets <hi>Ieremiah</hi>
