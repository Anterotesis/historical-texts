            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:11865:4"/>Afterward the <hi>Cretonians</hi> presented to the emperour a gallant colt, which in the opinion of all the beholders was like to prove a nagge of rare spirit and pace: but when <hi>Virgil</hi> saw him, he told the master of the horse that it was bred of a very faultie mare, and would prove neither quick spirited nor nimble paced: which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward fell out so indeed.

But <hi>Virgil</hi> instantly interrupting his thoughts, said; Hearken sir, I beseech you, on what ground I build this my opinion: Your majestie knows, that when I formerly foretold diverse things which could not be seen into nor foreshown, but by men of great lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and understanding, that your majestie the great monarch of the world again and again rewarded me with a lot and allowance of bread, which surely is the propertie eith<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To whom <hi>Virgil</hi> answered, If he excell others as much in liberalitie and goodnesse, as in riches and in honour.

            <l>Which I most wofully distrest did see,</l>

            <l>O what hard-hearted <hi>Greek, Vlysses,</hi> could</l>
            <l>From teares, large flouds of teares his eyes withhold?</l>

            <l>Makes me abhorre those thoughts, yet I'le be brief.</l>
            <l>The <hi>Grecian</hi> captains tir'd, retir'd from fight,</l>
            <l>With many a yeares fierce warre wearied outright,</l>
            <l>By <hi>Pallas</hi> art a mount-like horse they built,</l>
            <l>And with strong wooden ribs his sides they quilt.</l>
            <l>This fictious vow they leave: so flies the fame.</l>
            <l>In the huge concave belly of the same,</l>
            <l>Closely contriv'd, select brave youths they hide,</l>
            <l>And armed souldiers in its belly bide.</l>
            <l>In sight of <hi>Troy</hi> lies <hi>Tenedos</hi> faire isle,</l>

            <l>Were either sunk i'th' sea, or burnt i'th' fire,</l>

            <l>Renowned <hi>Dardans,</hi> sprung from <hi>Ioves</hi> high race,</l>

            <l>And this (if I mistake not) is the day,</l>

            <l>And here (as due) two bowls of wine most good</l>
            <l>He pour'd on ground, and two of sacred bloud,</l>
            <l>Two of new milk, and strew'd blew flowers, and said,</l>
            <l>Hail, sacred sire, once more all hail, safe laid,</l>
            <l>You sacred bones, sires soule, sav'd all in vain,</l>

            <l>From under th' earth, and smoothly crawling by</l>
            <l>The altar, girts the grave, whose back like skie</l>

            <l>His glassie scales most bright for to behold;</l>
            <l>Much like the rain-bow plac'd against <hi>Sols</hi> rayes,</l>

            <l>Five sheep, five hogs, five heifers black he slew,</l>
            <l>And bowls of wine upon them forth he threw,</l>
            <l>And invocates the soule of his great sire,</l>
            <l>And ghosts now rais'd from th' <hi>Acherontine</hi> fire.</l>
            <l>His mates likewise bring copious costly gifts,</l>

            <l>Disgrace gives fire to force, and foreknown might:</l>

            <l>

            <l>With these strong reasons arm'd, I thus came out,</l>

            <l>Sending a Goddesse down to <hi>Limbo's</hi> lake,</l>
            <l>These words with many teares and sighs she spake;</l>
            <l>And straight her head waterie gray weeds hid,</l>
            <l>And deep into the river down she slid.</l>
            <l>Meanwhile, <hi>Aeneas</hi> strongly doth oppose,</l>
            <l>His tree-like lance brandishing as he goes,</l>
            <l>And angrily thus cries; Now <hi>Turnus</hi> stout,</l>

            <l>
               <hi>Turnus</hi> in rage shaking his head, replies,</l>
            <l>Thy tongue, proud <hi>Trojan,</hi> nothing terrifies</l>
            <l>My troubled breast, but th'angry fatall Gods</l>
            <l>And <hi>Iupiter</hi> himself, with me at ods.</l>
            <l>And with these words he spide a mightie stone,</l>
            <l>A huge old stone, by which lands bounds were shown</l>

            <l>And with his trembling hand cast at his foe:</l>

            <l>That he himself rais'd high, did swiftly run,</l>
            <l>Took up the stone, or what else he had done:</l>

            <l>But went not its full way, nor hit its mark.</l>
            <l>Like as, when in our dreams, at midnight dark,</l>
            <l>VVhen lazie sleep tyr'd eye-lids down doth force,</l>

            <l>VVe talk sometimes in sleep, but faultringly</l>
            <l>Our forces fail, nor words, nor works comply:</l>

               <hi>Aeneas</hi> having in his nimble eyes</l>

            <l>VVith all his might: never flew stones so fast</l>
