            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>But before the next morning there was a ſtrange rout,</l>

               <l>Now the Clark to make water near morning did riſe,</l>
               <l>Then the Piſs-pot was lockt faſt betwixt his two thighs.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The Farmer's far Wife ſhe roſe up in her ſhift,</l>
               <l>For to help her poor Lover out at a dead lift;</l>
               <l>On his delicate Dildoul her right hand ſhe got,</l>
               <l>With the left hand ſhe ſeiz'd on the ſide of the Pot,</l>
               <l>Where ſhe tug'd and ſhe pull'd till ſhe made her arms ake,</l>
               <l>For ſhe likewiſe ſtuck faſt like a Bear to a ſtake.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>In this ſad diſtreſs with her foot ſhe did knock,</l>
               <l>Then her Daughter ſhe ſtraightways run up in her ſmock.</l>
               <l>Quoth the Mother, Girl, help us and make no excuſe,</l>
               <l>Sure the Pot is bewitch'd for we cannot get looſe;</l>
               <l>Pretty Nancy endeavour'd to ſet them both free,</l>
               <l>But as ſoon as ſhe touch'd it they ſtuck there all three.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The cunning Man open'd the door, being day,</l>
               <l>On his Conjuring pipe he began for to play;</l>
               <l>Naked all but their ſhifts they did caper and dance</l>
               <l>Through the Town, till they met with a Tailor by chance,</l>
               <l>Who would needs break the Pot, being luſty and ſtrong,</l>
               <l>But he ſtuck faſt and likewiſe went dancing along.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>He piping did lead them along the highway,</l>
               <l>Till they came to a place where her Husband he lay,</l>
               <l>Who when hearing a noiſe, he peep'd out of the Oak</l>
               <l>Like a Man that was frighted, the firſt words he ſpoke,</l>
               <l>He cry'd, What my friend Richard the good Pariſh-Clark</l>
               <l>Is it you then that tickles my Wife in the dark.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Now when they had caper'd three times round the Oak,</l>
               <l>Then the Spell or Enchantment immediately broke;</l>
               <l>The poor Tailor he run, but the Clark ſtaid behind.</l>
               <l>Quoth the Farmer, By you I'm a Cuckold I find;</l>
               <l>If for this foul offence, I am not ſatisfy'd,</l>
               <l>I'll immediately whip out your nutmegs, he cry'd.</l>

            <lg>
               <l>The Clark he did proffer to give him ten pound,</l>
               <l>For it was but a treſpaſs, he ſaid, on his ground;</l>
               <l>But the Farmer no leſs then a hundred would have,</l>
               <l>And the other did give it his Nutmegs to ſave;</l>
               <l>Their apparel was ſent for, and when they were dreſt,</l>
               <l>They went all to the Ale-houſe, and laug'd at the ieſt.</l>
