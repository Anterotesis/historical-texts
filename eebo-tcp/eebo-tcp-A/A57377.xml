            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                        <p>This latter opinion is urged by Arguments not to be neglected. 1.

<pb n="178" facs="tcp:60145:121"/>
same place <hi>Paul</hi> seemes to have written the II. <hi>To Thessal.</hi> by <hi>Tychicus</hi> also. For what he had written in the former of Christs coming, and of the end of the world, he further explaines in this, and vindicates.</item>
                           <item>3. The I. <hi>To Timothy</hi> seems writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by <hi>Paul,</hi> from <hi>Laodicea,</hi> of <hi>Phrygia Palatina,</hi> sent by <hi>Tychicus</hi> the <hi>Deacon,</hi> when returning the second time from <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> he passed through the Region of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latia</hi> and <hi>Phrygia,</hi> Acts 18.23. and before he returned to <hi>Ephesus,</hi> Acts 19.1.

                           <item>4. Next seems written the I. <hi>To Corinth,</hi> from <hi>Ephesus,</hi> while <hi>Paul</hi> stayed there, <hi>Act.</hi> 19.9. (and this rather then from <hi>Philippi,</hi> as the Greek postscript intimates,)

and before he went through <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia,</hi>) 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.5. for he pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed through <hi>Macedonia,</hi> after his three years abode at <hi>Ephesus.</hi> See <hi>Acts</hi> 19.1.8.10. compared with <hi>Act.</hi> 20.1. about the end of which time he is supposed to write this Epistle at <hi>Ephesus</hi> before <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecost.</hi> For he saith, <hi>I will tarry at</hi> Ephesus, <hi>until Pentecost</hi>; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.8. which when he wrote, he seems plainly to be at <hi>Ephesus</hi>: And this <hi>Pentecost</hi> went before that Pentecost, when he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> Act. 20.16. which fell out about the sixty fourth yeare after Christs death, in the ninth of <hi>Nero,</hi> which yeare coming to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> with the Contribution, he was cast into Bonds, in the thirtieth yeare after his Conversion, <hi>Athanas. in Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nops.

                           </item>
                           <item>5. Not much after this first Epistle, <hi>Paul</hi> wrote his II. <hi>To Corinth,</hi> from <hi>Philippi</hi> when after <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius</hi> his tumult, he left <hi>Ephesus</hi> and came into <hi>Macedonia,</hi> Acts
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:60145:122"/>
20.1, 2, 3. for then he must needs come to <hi>Philippi,</hi> (which was the first city upon the coast of <hi>Macedonia, Act.</hi> 16.12.) Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther referre that promise of his that he would come to <hi>Corinth,</hi> with them of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.4. that is there said to be done, when after he had passed thorough <hi>Macedonia</hi> into <hi>Greece,</hi> he had stayed three moneths, <hi>Ast.</hi> 20.2, 3. and after, we never read that he returned into <hi>Greece.</hi>
                           </item>
                           <item>6. In the same passing through <hi>Macedonia</hi>; At <hi>Nicopolis</hi> not farre distant from <hi>Philippi,</hi> before he came into <hi>Greece, Paul</hi> is suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to have written his Epistle To <hi>Titus</hi> whom he cals from <hi>Creet</hi> to <hi>Nicopolis,</hi> because <hi>there he had determined to winter,</hi> Tit. 3.12. though he seems after to have altered his purpose, and to have wintred in <hi>Grecia,</hi> as is thought at <hi>Corinth.</hi>
                           </item>
                           <item>7. The eminent Epistle to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi> seems to have been writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, whilst <hi>Paul</hi> was wintring
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:60145:122" rendition="simple:additions"/>
at <hi>Corinth.</hi> For after that, we read not that he returned to <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,</hi> but having wintred in <hi>Greece</hi> because of the treacheries of the Jewes, returning through <hi>Macedonia,</hi> he came into <hi>Syria</hi> with the Contribution, whence at last he was carried bound to <hi>Rome,</hi> in the sixty fourth yeare of <hi>Christ,</hi> the ninth of <hi>Nero,</hi> and in the thirtieth year after his own Conversion.

Now to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile these Controversies, and to settle them both in the truth, and in unity of judgement and affection, the Apostle being hindred from coming to them deals by letters; <hi>Demonstrating that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Iewes had cause to boast of their righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse and Prerogatives, nor Gentiles of their wisdome: both of them naturally being liable to eternal condemnation notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and both of them being to be justified by Faith in Christ alone, and that they should not abuse Grace, but walke in new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of life,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

Galatia</hi> was an ample Province of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia Minor,</hi> neer to <hi>Phrygia,</hi> into which anciently entred a people from <hi>Gallia</hi> of <hi>Europe,</hi> and seated themselves betwixt <hi>Bithynia</hi> and <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> as is testified by <hi>Strabo. l.</hi> 12. <hi>Iustin. l.</hi> 25. <hi>ab initio.

                        <hi>Occasion.</hi> It seemes by the current of the Epistle, that after <hi>Pauls</hi> departure from <hi>Galatia,</hi> having planted the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel there: there came among them false Apostles and corrupt teachers, who endeavoured to disgrace <hi>Paul's</hi> Apostle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship among them, and to pervert the purity and simplicity of the Gospel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong

them, and to pervert the purity and simplicitie of the Gospel of Christ, by mixtures of legall doctrines: urging the observance of both morall and ceremoniall law, and particularly of circumcision, as necessary to Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; so mingling and blending to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Gospell, works</hi> and <hi>faith, Iudaisme</hi> and <hi>Christianisme:</hi> tending dangerously to the subversion of that Church.</p>

                        <hi>Scope. Hence the Apostle yearning o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver these Churches, writes this Epistle to them, to recover them out of this errour in that fundamentall point of Iustification: to convince them of Iustification by faith on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; to demonstrate unto them the nature and use of morall and ceremoniall law: and incite them to a holy Christian Conversation.</hi>

                           <item>II. <hi>The Substance of the Epistle</hi> it selfe, which is principally Hortatory, in reference to that grace of God. He incites them, 1. To the constant exercise and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that grace of God, whereby they are brought into a regenerate and sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed state; and this concernes them all in their generall calling as Christians, <hi>c.</hi> 1, 3. to <hi>c.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 13. 2.

He that wrote this Epistle, testifies, that he <hi>must shortly put off this his Tabernacle, as our Lord Iesus Christ hath shewed him,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.14. to whom did Christ shew this but to <hi>Peter</hi>? Iohn 21.17. 3.

Now there were only three, <hi>viz.

them, it is of Apostolicall, yea of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Authority,) but unto <hi>Iames</hi> or <hi>Iohn</hi> none ever yet ascribed it, nor is there any reason so to do, but many to the contrary: therefore it must needs be confessed to be written by <hi>Peter.</hi> 4.

                  <p n="3">3. The nature of the book imports the divine Authority of it. For 1. It is eminently Propheticall, speaking of things that shall be hereafter, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.1, 19. and 22.7, 10, 18, 19. and the prophecies of this book, are touching future events in reference to the Church to the end of the world, till the Church, <hi>the Lambs wife,</hi> shall be fully ready for compleat marriage with the Lamb, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.7, 8, 9. So that neither an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient writers nor any other, but such as were inspired with a spirit of prophecy from the al-knowing God, could fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell these things to come, <hi>Isa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>.</hi> 41.22. 2. In the propheticall expressions of it,
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:60145:187"/>
it is consonant to other propheticall books, and gives light to them, <hi>Daniel, Zechariah,</hi> especially <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> As in the particulars of <hi>eating up the Book,</hi> Rev. 10.9, 10. with Ezek. 2.8. and 3.3. of <hi>sealing Gods promise,</hi> Rev. 7.2, 3. with Ezek. 9. of the <hi>foure living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> Rev. 4.6, 7. with Ezek. 1.5.6. of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> Rev. 20.8. with E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zek. 38.2. and 39.1. of the <hi>measu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Temple and City,</hi> Rev. 21.15. with Ezek. 40.3. &amp;c. <hi>Of the two olive trees,</hi> &amp;c. Rev. 11.4. with Zech. 4.3, 11, 14. &amp;c. 3. Many things fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told in this Book prophetically, are ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled and come to passe actually, As Interpreters have observed in many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars. Therefore this Book is of divine Authority, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 28.9.4. Promise of explaining how long the Idolatrous and Tyrannicall Kingdome of Anti-Christ should last, was made to <hi>Daniel</hi> the Prophet, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.4, 9. which some conceive to be fulfilled in these <hi>Apocalypticall visions,</hi> Rev. c. 11. and 12. and 13. and 17. &amp;c. And had not Christ under the New Testament left his Church some propheticall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:60145:187"/>
for her comfort against the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid cruelty, idolatry and darknesse of the Anti-christian Dominion, showing when it should have an end, and how happy at last the Church should be, all her enemies being universally made the footstool of the Lambe; she were in a worse condition then under the Old Testament; which were absurd.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. As the Holy Ghost by <hi>Moses,</hi> the <hi>first Penman</hi> of the Canon of the <hi>Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament</hi> warned the Jewes against ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to or diminishing from the word of God, <hi>yee shall not adde unto the word which I command you, neither shall you diminish from it,</hi> Deut. 9.2. and 12.32. So by the Apostle <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>last Penman of the Canon of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> Iesus Christ warneth all persons that heare the words of this Prophecy; <hi>If any man shall adde unto these things, God shall adde unto him the plagues that are written in this Book: And if any man shall take away from the words of the Book of this Prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the Book of Life, and out of the Holy City, and from the things which are written in this Book,</hi> Rev. 22.18,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:60145:188"/>
19. By which severe Commination, the integrity and divine Authority of this Book is asserted by Christ, against all whom Christ foresaw, would either in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to infringe the <hi>Authority</hi> of it, or corrupt the purity of it. Hereby then the whole divine Canon is sealed up, as fully now compleat, and divinely Authenticall, after which we are to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect no more Scripture from God.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The generall current of best Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, except some few particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and divers of them guilty of such heresies as this Book condemnes, hath embraced this Book, and accounted it of divine Authority.
