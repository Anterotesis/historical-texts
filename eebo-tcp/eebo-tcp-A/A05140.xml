            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Thomas
LORD Bruce,
Earle of Elgin.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He message sent by those
two sorrowfull sisters in
the Gospell unto our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
(with the change
onely of one sickly word)
is the ground of the sad newes which
I bring to your Lordship: (if at least
that which is already knowne every
where, may be called newes) the friend
whom you loved is dead, which is the
cause that these few plaintive leaves
present themselves to your Lordship
in their funerall blackes; his true love
and affection to mee, hath perswaded
mee to proclaime my griefe in this

<pb facs="tcp:8784:3"/>
manner, for the losse of so worthy a
deare friend, to the world. And your
Lordships love to him hath prompted
me, a meere stranger to your Lordship
(with boldnesse enough without your
knowledg) to send them abroad under
the countenance of your Honourable
Name. If your Lordship question my
over-much daring herein, in fastening
my poore scriblets upon your Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
I have nothing to say for my self, in
excuse, but to flye behind the traverse
of his Name, where your Lordship
will be pleased either to see no faults
at all, or willingly to over-see them.
To this my simple memoriall of him, I
have (as a poore Post-script) added di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
Emblemicall Essayes, which for
mine owne private entertainment of
idle houres, I have long since at se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
times composed and layd by
mee (amongst many other of severall
subjects) unseene of any, save of him
whose absence I now lament: which,
seeing they received approbation from
him, I am the more confident to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
to your Lordships hands, and
next, to the publike view; especially
conceiving within my self, that it will

<pb facs="tcp:8784:3"/>
not seeme altogether unsuitable or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper
(after the naming of a particular
friend) to fall into some few short dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
of friends and friendship in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall;
neither (after the lamentation
for a lost friend) to let fall some scatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
meditations of death, by whom
this so deere friend is reaved from the
sweet communion of so many his good
friends, who doe still love him, and
misse him. The conclusions which I
have fetcht out of these <hi>Italian</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbiall
maximes, I must confesse are
but as the first faint drops which Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists
are wont to extract out of preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Simples and Mineralls, through an
earthen Limbecke or a Bolts-head, of
brittle glasse (at the best) and so of
themselves neither greatly usefull or
pleasant, but as it is in the Proverbe,
<hi>Chi beve vino, beve sangue, al meno
quadagna il colore;</hi> he that drinks wine
drinkes blood, (at least) hee gaines the
colour cleere to himselfe: so this my
collection of so many elegant Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs
in a language so delightfull, stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in the front of my barren conceits
like a curious nosegay of fragrant
flowers, with their stemmes hid in

<pb facs="tcp:8784:4"/>
the hollow cane of a silly fennell-stalk,
may hope to win favour &amp; acceptance,
for the pleasant sent which they bring
with them; the Diamond (by being set
on a dark dull foile) losing yet none of
the naturall worth, though much of
that pretious lustre, which Art could
have added unto it. And thus (having
given up this account of my selfe to
your Lordship, and fearing to adde
prolixitie to my boldnesse) I humbly
commend my selfe and my worthlesse
paines to your Lordships pardon, and
acceptance: in the one applealing to
the goodnesse of your owne Noble
Nature; the other beseeching you to
vouchsafe mee for his sake, for whose
I have herein cast my selfe upon the
necessitie of craving your Lordships
favour and pardon, and so rest.</p>
