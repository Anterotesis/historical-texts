         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Husbandmans Harrow
to pull down the Ridges of the
PRESBYTERIALL GOVERNMENT
and to ſmooth, a little, the
INDEPENDENT. That they and others may walk together upon plain
Scripture Grounds, without ſtumbling on the
ridgedneſs of either, or both. Containing divers new and unanſwerable Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
properly deduced from Sacred Scriptures to this
purpoſe, that have never yet been propoſed by any on either partee,
Which induceth the Husbandman to make thus bold
whether welcome or no. And having prooved alſo the ſaid Scripturall Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
that like <hi>teeth of ſteel,</hi> they will pull down the Ridges, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they break or bend; having been forced to try them
upon ridged lands: becauſe he could not walk upon
either of their grounds without ſtumbling
on the Ridges.</p>

or hear, and underſtand thoſe things that are
here expreſt. I deſire briefly in the name of God,
and the Lord Jeſus Christ, to admoniſh and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort,
yea, to kindle, and incourage you in the
ways of truth, of meekneſs, and of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<hi>as</hi> Pſal. 45. &amp; Hebr. 1.</p>
            <p>But to danke, and daunt, and diſcourage the adverſaries in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
reſpect, wherein they doe oppoſe, or exalt themſelves againſt the
Lord Jeſus, or againſt his Scepter; yea, againſt his Kingdom,
against his truth, and meekneſs, and righteouſneſſe, <hi>as</hi> Hebr. 1.
8, 9, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For the time is come, that</hi> he hath taken to himſelf <hi>(even)</hi> his
great power, and hath in <hi>(meaſure)</hi> raigned, as <hi>Revel.</hi> 11. 17.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nay, there</hi> is heard <hi>(already, even)</hi> a loud voyce, ſaying in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
<hi>(to wit, in the Church)</hi> Now is ſalvation, and ſtrength, and
the Kingdome of our God, and the power of his Chriſt; for the
Accuſer of our brethren, <hi>(to wit, Sathan)</hi> is <hi>already</hi> caſt down,
which accuſed them before our God day and night, as <hi>Revel.</hi> 12.
10, 11, 12.</p>
            <p>And they <hi>have</hi> (in meaſure alredy) <hi>overcom by the bloud of
the Lamb, and by the word of their Teſtimony.</hi> And if you aske
(who) that have thus overcome. They are plainly noted what
ſtamp they are <hi>[of;]</hi> For they are of ſuch, as <hi>have not loved their
lives unto the very death.</hi> This is their ſtamp, and let it be their
Motto, for there is none more proper, neither any more precious,
or truly honourable amongst the Sons of men.</p>
            <p>And therefore rejoyce ye heavens, <hi>(to wit, yee Churches)</hi> and
ye that dwel in them.</p>
            <p>But wo be to the inhabitants of the earth, and of the Sea, for
<pb facs="tcp:97084:3"/>
the Devil himſelf is come down unto you, <hi>[and that]</hi> having great
wrath, knowing that he hath but a ſhort time, till he muſt be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed,
and chained up, in the bottomleſs pit, for a thouſand years,
<hi>as Chap.</hi> 20. 1, 2, 3. <hi>for he must be</hi> ſhut up, and a ſeale ſet upon
him, that he ſhall deceive the Nations no more, till the thouſand
years ſhall be fulfilled: <hi>though</hi> after that, he muſt be looſed, for a little
ſeaſon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And therefore to dank, and dant, and diſcourage the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries;
and for terror and amazement, even to the people of God;
yea,</hi> ſuch as fear his Name, whether they be ſmall or great. <hi>Leſt they
ſhould be ingaged on the adverſaries part;</hi> againſt Michael, <hi>and
againſt</hi> his Angels, <hi>as Revel.</hi> 12. 7. <hi>Even againſt him, I meane,</hi>
That is the firſt and the laſt, that liveth, and was dead, but that
is now alive for evermore, Amen: who hath the keys of hell and
of death, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. 17, 18.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Yea, for terror unto ſuch, as ſhall ingage against him; I
might write</hi> a Book, <hi>not only</hi> within, but on the backſide; <hi>like
that ſpoken of in</hi> Ezekiel; And all <hi>full, even</hi> of bitter lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and mournings, and woes.</p>
            <p>Though it is doubtful, it ſhould but be in (vain to the moſt
part.) For even the people of God, that are <hi>his Elect and
precious,</hi> are many of them grown, even ſecure and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs;
yea, dull and uncapable of any deep impreſſions, either
of fears, or hopes: And they are too apt, either not to [hear,]
<hi>or when they have heard, to let the wordsſlip,</hi> as Heb. 2. 1, 2, 3.
and ſo incur to themſelves ſo much greater judgements, unleſs they
repent.</p>
            <p>And therefore, woe, woe, and alaſs for ever, to all that do but
<hi>neglect;</hi> much more, <hi>that deſpiſe ſo great ſalvation,</hi> Hebr. 2. 3,
4, to 9.</p>
            <p>Yea, woe, woe, and alaſs for ever, to the inhabitants of the
earth that forget God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And above all, unto them, that in meaſure</hi> know God, and yet
in no meaſure will glorifie him as God, neither are thankful; but
become vaine in their imaginations, &amp;c. <hi>as Rom.</hi> 1. 21. <hi>Yea,</hi> who
have changed the truth of God into a lye: and worſhipped, and
ſerved the creature <hi>(yea any creature)</hi> more then the Creator, who
is God indeed, bleſſed for ever, Amen.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:97084:3"/>
               <hi>Yea, Woe, woe, and alaſs for ever, unto thoſe,</hi> who not likeing
to retaine God in their knowledge, <hi>nor in their minds and thoughts,</hi>
he ſhall give them over to a reprobate minde, to doe thoſe
things which are not convenient, being filled with all unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
&amp;c. <hi>as the particulars are enumerated, Rom.</hi> 1. 28, 29, 30,
31, 32.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Yea,</hi> Woe unto the world becauſe of offences: And though it
muſt needs be, that offences ſhall come, yet woe unto ſuch, by
whom they come: It were better for them that a Mill ſtone were
hanged about their necks; and they were caſt into the Sea, then that
they ſhould offend but one of the leaſt of thoſe little ones,' that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
in Chriſt, <hi>as Matth.</hi> 18. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3. <hi>to</hi> 14.</p>
            <p>And what ever men thinke, yea, though they care not to deſpiſe
or offend, and reproach, yea even murther and deſtroy, and ſeek
to root out, even the very names and poſterities of any ſuch little
ones, that beleeve in Chriſt; making no more account of the kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of ſuch, then of ſo many Fleas.</p>
            <p>Yet, <hi>It is not the will of their heavenly Father, that</hi> ſo much as <hi>one
of theſe little ones ſhould periſh,</hi> as verſ. 14. And therefore it is,
that he doth admoniſh us, how to deale with ſuch, if they trespaſs
againſt us, <hi>verſ.</hi> 15, <hi>&amp;c. For precious in the ſight of the Lord is
the death of his Saints.</hi> And he will doubtleſs preſerve their ſouls,
though cruel <hi>Cains,</hi> ſhall deſtroy their bodies: yea, he will doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
<hi>preſerve the faithful, and plenteouſly reward every proud
doer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But let it admoniſh ſuch who are faithful, and that obey his
voyce, to</hi> take heed unto themſelves; and if their brethren ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them, tell them of their faults; and if they repent, forgive
them, &amp;c. yea, though ſeven times over in one day, <hi>as Mat.</hi> 18.
<hi>For we are not allowed to</hi> hate our brethren in our hearts; but to
tel them of their faults plainly. <hi>Neither is it lawful to judg and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
them,</hi> as Rom. 15. 4. 7, 10, 12, 13, 19, 22. <hi>&amp; Chap.</hi> 15. 1, 2, 3,
5, 6, 7. according to appearance, but righteous judgement; <hi>We
are not allowed to</hi> account them as enemies, but to admoniſh them
as brethren; <hi>yea though they ſo far diſobey, even</hi> the Apoſtles
ſayings, as that we are neceſſarily ingaged, to <hi>Withdraw from them,
as</hi> 2 Theſ. 3. 6.</p>
            <p>And therefore woe unto ſuch, what ever they be, whether Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians,
or Independants, that ſhall <hi>reſiſt the truth,</hi> of which they
<pb facs="tcp:97084:4"/>
are convinced, and ſhal, through partial respects to their own parts,
ſeek the deſtruction either of other, and remain implacable, and
malign, and hate, and deſpiſe their brethren, becauſe in every reſpect
they cannot accord to be of their minds, nor walk with them juſt
in their ways, when yet not withstanding if partiallity do not blind
their eyes, they may both ſee faults in their own ways, in which
they are engaged, which no engagement ought to bind them to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
or abide in after they are diſcovered, but they ought freely to
<hi>confeſs their faults each to others,</hi> as <hi>James</hi> 4. 11. 12. &amp; <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. 16.
being convinced of them, and both of them ought <hi>to conſent freely
to the wholeſom words of our Lord and Saviour even Jeſus Chriſt,
and to the doctrine which is according to godlineſs,</hi> &amp; not to <hi>teach
otherwiſe;</hi> but if any do, the Apoſtle telleth us plainly, (and we
are apt to beleeve it,) That <hi>ſuch are puft up, and know nothing,
but dote about queſtions and ſtrifes of words, whereof cometh en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,
ſtrife, railing, evil ſurmiſings, perverſe diſputings, of men, of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
minds, and deſtitute of the truth, ſuppoſing that gain is godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:</hi>
And biddeth <hi>Timothy, from ſuch to withdraw himſelf,</hi> as
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 3, 4, 5.</p>
            <p>And we are apt to do as he adviſed <hi>Timothy,</hi> for if it was good
for <hi>Timothy,</hi> it is in all liklihood good for us alſo; and how ſhall we
think ſuch men honeſt, that will not <hi>approve of the things that are
honeſt,</hi> as the Apoſtle injoyneth them in another place? For it is
not enough not to oppoſe, or reſiſt, and ſpeak againſt ſuch things,
but they ought <hi>to approve them,</hi> and teſtifie their aſſent and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
thereunto, ſo far forth as they are apparently honeſt or
true, &amp;c. elſe they do implicitely oppoſe and reſist them, or ſhew
their unwillingneſs to embrace and obey them, and that they are
ſtubborn and rebellious, and even at enmity with God in thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects,
becauſe he croſſeth them even in their own devices and
ways, &amp;c. And doubtleſs many good men in theſe our days are
deeply engaged in this very ſin, and yet we are not allowed to judg
and cenſure them as enemies and Apoſtates, but ſhould love, and
pity, and pray for them, <hi>conſidering our ſelves as alſo ſubject to the
ſame failings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beloved Brethren, The Scripture is clear concerning <hi>Jonas,</hi>
that he was a Prophet of the Lord, and was immediately called and
ſent of God, as a choyce and famous man, to propheſie againſt <hi>Nineve,</hi>
and yet becauſe that he knew the goodneſs and mercy of God, and
<pb facs="tcp:97084:4"/>
that upon repentance he would pardon; he was unwilling even <hi>to
preach the preaching which the Lord commanded him,</hi> in all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood,
leſt his future prophecying ſhould be the worſe credited;
and how rebelliouſly he carryed and demeaned himſelf, till he was
forced through extremity, by the power of God, to ſubmit unto him,
and humble himſelf, and <hi>out of the belly of hell</hi> even to <hi>cry unto
him:</hi> And after all that, being but a little afflicted for want of
the <hi>gourd,</hi> how paſſionately angry and teeny he was, and durſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
ſtubbornly, even in the preſence of God, ſpeaking it vocably
unto him, that <hi>he did well to be angry, even to the very death;</hi>
like a man desperate, and as he had been at enmity even with God
himſelf; and yet he was, doubtleſs, a man inspired with the Spirit
of God, and very intimate and familiar with him: Look for this
<hi>Jonas</hi> 4.</p>
            <p>And therefore ſtrange is the temper, and natural frailties and
dispoſitions (by nature) of ſome good men:</p>
            <p>Nay, who can we read of almoſt in Scripture, though never
ſo holy and fully inspired, but we may read likewiſe of their failings
and infirmities, and of ſome of their groſs and notorious ſins; as
<hi>David in the matter of Uriah; Peter</hi> in his diſſimulation, and
<hi>building up that</hi> by his practiſe, <hi>which he deſtroyed</hi> by his doctrine:
and <hi>Paul</hi> had his infirmities and <hi>Pricks in the fleſh</hi> after his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
and calling to the Miniſtry. <hi>Elias</hi> alſo <hi>was a man ſubject
to like paſſions, as the Apoſtles were,</hi> who confeſſed themſelves ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<hi>to like paſſions as others,</hi> Acts 14. 15. and yet they were men
<hi>full of faith, and of the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> ſo was <hi>Barnabas,</hi> ſo was <hi>Peter,</hi>
ſo were all the Apostles, and many others, in whom we might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance;
and it would be uſeful to determine from murder, or <hi>[ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting]
of their brethren,</hi> which is no better then <hi>[man-ſlaughter,]</hi> as
1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 5. which many are too apt to take liberty to do, (becauſe
they ſee ſome faults and miſcarriages in them,) as if it were a
ground fully ſufficient to excuſe their malice, becauſe they have
ſome ſpots, yea ſome fleſh, as well as ſpirit: And they will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve,
that any ſuch <hi>have the Spirit of God,</hi> becauſe they have alſo
<hi>a ſpirit of fleſh, a Law in their members, by which they are led cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
againſt the Law of their minds;</hi> for they will not conſider
that they have but <hi>the Spirit of God in meaſure:</hi> And that it is
needful they be ſometimes left to their own ſtrength, that they
might remember, and freely acknowledg, by whoſe ſtrength they
<pb facs="tcp:97084:5"/>
ſtand, and give the glory to God; for who is there, but is apt to
think, <hi>that their mountains are made ſtrong, ſo that they ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be moved,</hi> and to <hi>judg,</hi> and cenſure, and <hi>condemn their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi>
and ſay of themſelves like the proud Phariſee, <hi>[We are not
like other men?]</hi> If they ſhould not ſometimes have <hi>pricks in the
fleſh, and meſſengers of Satan ſent to buffet them,</hi> a little matter
will puſſ us up; and therefore it is that the Apoſtle admoniſheth,
that <hi>he that thinketh he ſtandeth, ſhould take</hi> (special) <hi>heed leſt
he fall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For by how much the more confident any man is in his own
ſtrength, by ſo much the more likely he is to fall: And by how
much the more ſevere, rigorous, cenſorious, or uncharitable, any
man is in judging of others; by ſo much the more likely and ſure
he is ſo to fall himſelf, as to be juſtly culpable of the ſame, or worſe
then thoſe whom he judged, condemned and cenſured.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And therefore it is, That Chriſt himſelf hath admoniſhed us,</hi>
Judg not, that you be not judged, Mat. 7. 1, 2, &amp;c. Rom. 2. 1, to the
end. Chap. 7. and Chap. 14.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And ſhould not</hi> they that are ſtrong bear the infirmities of the
weak, but they muſt pleaſe themſelves? <hi>Should not</hi> every one of
us pleaſe his neighbor in that which is good to edification, as Chriſt
himſelf alſo did? <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 1, 2, 3. and Chap. 14. and 1 Cor. 16. 14.</p>
            <p>Is it not the advice even of the Holy Ghoſt? Is it not the will
of our heavenly Father, that we ſhould <hi>ſtudy the things that make
for peace, and that might provoke unto Love?</hi> Not unto Wrath,
nor to enmity nor hatred, but that which is <hi>the end of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,</hi>
and the very life and ſtrength of all Community, and
of the Commonwealth; yea, the happineſs and felicity of all King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
yea Governments, whatſoever, Civil or Eccleſiaſtical, and
the ſubjects thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And it is the onely, or at leaſt the chief ſign of the dwelling of
God, either in or amongst us:</hi> If we love one another, God dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
in us, and his love is perfect in us; for God is love, and he that
dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God, and God in him, 1 Joh. 4. 12,
16, 20, 21.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And not onely ſo, but it is a token of his bleſſing likewiſe, for</hi>
there the Lord commandeth the bleſſing, yea, even permanent bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>and that the chief of all, to wit,</hi> [Life] for evermore, <hi>that is
to ſay, where there is</hi> unity of brethren, and that they dwell ſo
<pb facs="tcp:97084:5"/>
together, Pſa. 133. and continue in their love.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And though it be true that in ſome good meaſure the</hi> Spirit of
life from God is <hi>already</hi> entred into the two Witneſſes, <hi>and they
are creeping up to</hi> ſtand upon their feet; <hi>ſo that</hi> great fear <hi>is (in
meaſure)</hi>
faln upon them that ſaw <hi>(and inſulted over)</hi> them, <hi>as</hi>
Rev. 11. 10, 11.</p>
            <p>Yet, let us never expect the approbation of God, and to be <hi>called
up to heaven,</hi> nor to <hi>aſcend in a cloud</hi> to ſuch eminent respect in the
[Church univerſal] which is meant by [Heaven] Verſ. 12. till
<hi>faith and love,</hi> which are the two proper and eſſential [witneſſes]
that are here meant, be inspired into us <hi>by the Spirit of life from
God,</hi> and ſhall raiſe and advance us, who are but the ſubjects in
whom they recide, and who are but the inſtruments in whom they
act, as a viſible expreſs of their inviſible power and nature, &amp;c. for
the glory of God, and the <hi>terror and amazement of all his adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:</hi>
for it is by faith, if we prevail with God, or do any thing
worthy of respect with him, or in the ſight of men, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.
And <hi>faith worketh by love;</hi> And <hi>he that beleeveth hath the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in himſelf:</hi> See 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 7, 8. So that if theſe two Witneſſes
be inspired into us, and we be acted by them, it will be indeed to the
<hi>terror and amazement</hi> of all our enemies, that are enemies of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And there ſhall be ſuch an</hi> earthquake in the ſame hour as ſhall
affright a remnant, who ſhall give glory to the God of Heaven;
<hi>And we ſhall bear a part in that triumphant ſong, Verſ.</hi> 15. to 18.</p>
            <p>And therefore <hi>Edifying one another in Faith and Love, which
are in</hi> Christ Jeſus, ought to be the end and chief endeavor of all
our buſineſs in Church affairs, as it is the end of the whole Law,
and as I hope in God it ſhall be mine, Who am,</p>

value, and more to eſteemed then the means to accompliſh it, and
therefore ought to be chieſly eyed in all the way that leadeth
thereunto.</item>
               <item>2. Secondly, the Illuſtration and application of the foreſaid end of

               <item>3. Thirdly, four grounds and arguments drawn from Scripture,
as intending, and tending to a Reconciliation of the Churches of
God, in reſpect of the Government and Diſcipline there of, Pa. 7.</item>
               <item>1. The firſt from the lawfulneſs of Chaſtity or Marriage. <hi>Pag.</hi>
8. 9.</item>
               <item>2. The ſecond from the lawfulneſs of community of goods, amongſt
ſuch who can ſo agree, or the claiming of propriety amongst ſuch
who cannot. Pag. 9. 10.</item>
               <item>3. The third from the lawfulneſs of faſting, and prayer; or of eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and drinking. Pag. 10. 11.</item>
               <item>4. And the fourth from the lawfulneſs of ſuch, who think they
ought, of being of the ſtricteſt Sect of the true Religion, ſuch as
were the Phariſecs, or one more remiſſe, ſuch as was the Scribes.
<hi>Pag.</hi> 12.</item>

or it may be <hi>[needs]</hi> or ought to be; his calling of God, not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging
him to it, as it doth the other, being bound in ſpirit to
the quite contrary, and in conſcience both. Pag. 12.</item>
               <item>And one the other part, That thoſe that are ſtricter ought not to
blame ſuch as are more remiſs in ſome reſpects; becauſe for
ought they know, they are ſo ingaged, and called of God, and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
bound in conſcience, or bound in ſpirit, within their own
Sphere. Pag 12.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>Conſeq.</hi> The conſequence where of being to this purpoſe, That they
ought not therefore to compel each other, unto conformity, either
to the ſtrictneſs of the one, or the remiſneſs of the other: proving
that the Magiſtrate ought to tollerate, or ſuffer both, and not
to ingage them one againſt the other. Pag. 12.</item>
               <item>4. Fourthly, The application of the aforeſaid grounds, and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to the matter in hand; to wit, to the Churches, and the
government thereof. Pag. 13. 14. 15.</item>
               <item>5. Fiftly, Firſt the application of the aforeſaid grounds and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions
by way of juſt reproofe unto both parties, becauſe they do
not agree, and live, and love, and carry as brethren. Pag. 15.</item>
               <item>For which end the Rule of Charity is propoſed, and a little proſc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted Pag. 16. 17. 18.</item>
               <item>2. The punctual application of the precedent concluſions are briefly
aſſerted; first to the one, and ſecondly to the other, and a general
conſequence concluded thence. Pag. 19.</item>
               <item>6. An objection propoſed and anſwered at large; to wit, that ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Preſbyteries plead that Independents Rules and ways of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline,
are not more ſtrict, but more remiſſe, and looſe in many
respects, giving way for liberty of all Religious without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troule
by the Civil State, as ſo they ſpeak of them: Pag.
19.</item>
               <item>It is anſwered at large, That the Rules and Principles, according
to which they engage to act, are manifeſtly ſtricter, and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
too, in divers particulars, which are held forth in ſeveral
aſſertions, wherein likewiſe they are engaged, in duty and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
ſo to do: Though it is not denyed, but many Preſbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians
are engaged in conſcience to do the contrary, and are fully
perſwaded that they ought ſo to do for the time preſent. <hi>P.</hi> 20.</item>
               <item>1. It is aſſerted, That they are juſtly ſtricter with whom they do
<pb facs="tcp:97084:7"/>
incorporate and joyn themſelves in Church policy, becauſe that,
ſo far forth as their joyning together hath respect to the policy
and government of the Church, no Church can be too ſtrict.
<hi>Pag.</hi> 20.</item>
               <item>Though, in other respects, they ought to joyn according to the rule
of Charity, and not of Certainty, as in adminiſtration of the
Word and Sacraments, as 1 Cor. 16. 14. Chap. 13. &amp; Chap.
10. 32, 33.</item>
               <item>2. It is aſſerted, That (for the ſame ends, and reaſons, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects,
alledged in the former) they are juſtly ſtrict and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious,
and teach it as a duty, That all that are found, and
known to be men of approved fidelity, within convenient bounds,
ſhould thus incorporate and joyn themſelves; and to engage
themſelves in Covenant unto God, for better ſecurity and deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
engagement unto all brotherly and Chriſtian duties, and
to deal impartially in all ſuch buſineſs, as concerns them all, for
the glory of God, and the Churches good; and to be wiſe as ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents,
though innocent as doves. <hi>P.</hi> 21, 22.</item>
               <item>3. It is aſſerted, and proved at large, That the Principles of
Independents are ſtricter, and neerer to the Scripture rules, for
edifying of the Church, in that they do not limit the holy one of
Iſrael to ſpeak in publique by the learned onely. <hi>P.</hi> 22 to 47</item>
               <item>For proving Whereof, 1. It is aſſerted from 1 Cor. 12. 7, to 12. That
naturally and manifeſtly flows from hence; That to whomſoever
the manifeſtation of the Spirit is given, it is given to ſuch to
profit withall. <hi>Pag.</hi> 23.</item>
               <item>2. It is proved againſt an objection to the contrary, That ſuch who
have the Spirit of God, and are ſpiritualiz'd thereby, may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
all things, yea, the deep things of God, as 1 Cor. 2. 10. 15.
yea, though they be unlearned in the tongues; And that the
manifeſtations of the Spirit may be evident and demonſtrable,
even in theſe our days, to ſuch who are ſpiritual, though not
unto others, as verſ. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Pag. 23. 24.</item>
               <item>3. The particular gifts, or notes, or qualifications, or operations, or
adminiſtrations, are the chief of them produced from ſacred
Scripture, whereby the manifeſtation of the Spirit of God, and
of power, &amp;c. may be evident and demonſtrable in ſuch as are
not of thoſe that are learned in the Tongues, nor graduates in
the Schools, even in theſe our days, yea, and that in ſuch
<pb facs="tcp:97084:7"/>
who do no miracles. <hi>Pag.</hi> 24.</item>
               <item>4. It is aſſerted and proved againſt an Objection, That theſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
gifts and adminiſtrations, which are reckoned up by the
Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> cannot be ſo counterfeited by the carnal, but they
may eaſily be diſcerned by thoſe that are ſpiritual <hi>P.</hi> 24, 25.</item>
               <item>And to that purpoſe there is divers Notes from ſacred Scripture,
which (being found in any) do prove for certain, and do evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
demonstrate, that it is indeed even the Spirit of God that
ſpeaketh in them, yea though they do no miracles. <hi>Pag.</hi> 25.</item>
               <item>1. The first from <hi>John</hi> 7. 18. <hi>Ibid.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. <hi>From</hi> John 10. 10. 28. Pag. 26.</item>
               <item>3. <hi>From</hi> James 1. 17, 18. Ibid.</item>
               <item>4. <hi>From</hi> John 16. 8. Ibid.</item>
               <item>5. <hi>From</hi> 1 Cor. 4. 5. <hi>&amp;</hi> Chap. 14. 24, 25. Ibid.</item>

               <item>But that the chiefeſt of all theſe particulars, or any that can be
exhibited, is a clear underſtanding and knowledg of God, and of
the ſacred Scriptures, and the ſecrets thereof, and of the ſecrets
and mysteries of his ſacred Kingdom: Becauſe without all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie,

1. 2. <hi>pag.</hi> 27.</item>
               <item>To which a Reaſon is rendred, drawn from the contrary, <hi>Luke</hi> 8. 10.
<hi>Mark</hi> 4. 33, 34. <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. <hi>Ibid.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>And a Conſequence gathered, backed with 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 5. &amp; <hi>Matth.</hi>
10. 19. <hi>Ibid.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>And an Objection anſwered, to ſatisfie ſuch who count it immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty.
<hi>pag.</hi> 28.</item>
               <item>1. And another to ſatisfie ſuch who object, That ſpeaking unto men
to Edification, and Exhortation, and Comfort, is not properly to
prophecy, becauſe prophecying is foreſhewing of things to come;
which is fully anſwered, and clearly vindicated, that it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
prophecying, as the Apostle aſſerteth it from <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 1.
&amp; <hi>John</hi> 10. 10. &amp; 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 11, 12, 13. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 1, 3, 4. And
the chief of all for the perfecting of the Saints, and for the work
of the Miniſtry, and for the edification of the body of Chriſt,
<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. <hi>pag.</hi> 29.</item>
               <item>2. And ſecondly, That it is a more preſent evidence and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
<pb facs="tcp:97084:8"/>
of the Spirit then ſhewing of things to come, as <hi>Agabus</hi>
did; for till the things be come, they do not manifeſt the Spirit
of God. <hi>pag.</hi> 29, 30.</item>
               <item>3. And thirdly, The danger is ſhewed to thoſe that despiſe, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt,
and diſparage theſe things or ways, &amp;c. or them that uſe
them; or to any authority that will not ſuffer it, and give liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to all them, whoſe ſpirit God hath raiſed, to build up the
Churches in their moſt holy faith, leſt wrath be upon them from

&amp; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. <hi>pag.</hi> 31. 32, 33.</item>
               <item>Yea, that it is matter of dangerous conſequence, either to act, or
comply with ſuch; ſhew'd by many Reaſons, and all Objections
anſwered fully, which are too many, and too large to abreviate.
<hi>pag.</hi> 47.</item>
               <item>4 Aſſertion is, concerning their Independency, in respect of other

Antichristian tyranny and uſurpation. <hi>pag.</hi> 53. to 56.</item>
               <item>6 Aſſertion is, That they are juſtly ſtricter in keeping themſelves

<hi>pag.</hi> 58. to 63.</item>
               <item>2. Secondly, Concerning the authoritative acting of an Aſſembly
of Churches in the Name of God, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,
wherein is proved, that withdrawing of Communion is not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient,
but they ought to proceed even to Excommunication, yea
even to Execration, if their ſin ſo deſerve, as for toleration of
Idolatry, Blaſphemy, and ſuch haynous ſins in their Church-Members
or Officers. <hi>pag.</hi> 63. to 68.</item>
               <item>3. Thirdly, Concerning their ſtrictneſs in tryal of all whom they

but proſecuted and argued againſt them from <hi>pag.</hi> 72. to the

            <head>An Husbandmans Harrow to pull down
the Ridges of the Presbyteriall Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He end of a thing (ſaith wiſe <hi>Solomon)</hi> is better
then the beginning thereof.</p>
            <p>Therefore it follows, that the end of a thing
ought chiefly to be eyed as a mark to ſhoot at,
yea, as the complement, and perfection of all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours,
and means, and waies to attain ſuch
end.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And ſo likewiſe the Apoſtle</hi> Paul, <hi>by the ſpirit of God, giveth
us clearely to underſtand,</hi> That the end of the Commandement is
love, out of a pure heart, and a good Conſcience, and Faith un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fained,
1 Tim. 1. 5.</p>
            <p>From which we may juſtly argue; That if Love, &amp;c. be the end
of the Commandement: And if the end be better, then the means,
to attain it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conſ.</hi> Then the means for the accompliſhment, (and that ſhould
lead unto, or acquire ſuch an end,) ought not to be pleaded, or ſet
againſt; nor valued and eſteemed above the end.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> For then it utterly fruſtrates, and makes the meanes void,
if we rob or ſpoile it of its proper end; And ſo both end and
means are utterly vain.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:97084:10"/>
               <hi>Inſtan.</hi> As for Inſtance he that pleadeth the Law againſt Juſtice
or Legality of proceedings in matter of State, againſt the good, and
peace, and ſafety of the people.</p>
            <p>He pleadeth againſt both the Law, and juſtice, and againſt the
good and ſafety of the people: And not only ſo, but he diſparageth
the Law, and legall proceedings. As if they intended not, or at leaſt,
were not able to attaine their end, but were made on purpoſe to
obſtruct ſuch Juſtice, as ought to be their end, for which they are
made.</p>
            <p>And though it is true, that the Law of God, being of abſolute
perfection, can never properly be ſo pleaded; yet unjuſtly, and
improperly, it both may, and is; though it ought not ſo to be,
but the quite contrary, as hath been ſaid.</p>
            <p>But how much more ought the Lawes of men, (being not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
perfect, nor ſufficently wiſe to attain their end) never to
be pleaded; but with chief reference, and cleare reſpect to the end
thereof.</p>
            <p>So that he that objects, or pleads them at all; ſhould hold forth
with them, even the end it ſelf; and ſhould make it manifeſt, how
the Law he pleadeth, tendeth as a means, to acquire unto, or bring
about ſuch end: Leſt he plead the Law againſt Juſtice, as ſome
have done; though deeply learned in the Laws of the Land; En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangering
thereby, to eſtabliſh Arbitrary, Tyrannicall power,
greater then before: concerning which, there is enough already,
and at large expreſt to the whole Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Only this I add, that I cannot but wonder, how any rationall
man can ever deſire ſuch enſlaving power; or delight to uſe it, if
he had it granted, conſidering</p>
            <p>1. Firſt, they can never rationally, nor juſtly expect, nor be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
aſſured, of the cordial affection of any ſuch ſubjects, who are
but ſubjected by Arbitrary, cruel and tyrannical power.</p>
            <p>For all ſubjection, that is but meerly enforc'd, is evidently clear,
to be defective in love.</p>
            <p>2. Secondly all meer force by power, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is ſo far ſhort of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking
unto love, or any cordial affection, or honor indeed; as that
it diſ-ingageth and repels the affection, and force of love, and of all
proper uniting principles; and quite diverteth them into enmity and
hatred, and diſ-eſteem: eſpecially, in caſe, when the honor and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
which is forc'd unto, is not juſt and proper; but undue, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitable,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:97084:10"/>
and more then juſt, and without deſert.</p>
            <p>3. Thirdly, as the Scripture ſpeaks, for a man to ſeek his own
glory, is not glory, no, it is his ſhame; for when pride commeth,
then cometh ſhame: and it is not only lawful but even the bounden
duty of them that love the Lord, to hate evil, as pride, and arrogan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
and the evill way. And even the mouth that ſpeaketh proud
things, they ought to hate.</p>
            <p>4. Fourthly, What honor is it, or what glory, or renown, for a
man to Rule and have the command; yea, or to ſway a Scepter o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
a Kingdom of ſlaves? Were it not his ſhame amongſt King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
of men? And what renown could he poſſibly get in time of
Wars, by leading forth his ſlaves to battel, to engage them in ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
againſt Armies of men?</p>
            <p>Would they not cowardly deſert him, and leave him naked, rather
then loſe their lives, which are alwaies deare unto ſlaviſh men? they
are alwaies ſo ignoble, and of ſuch timorous ſpirits, in caſe of
danger.</p>
            <p>And then alſo, in regard they are not ingaged, nor bound cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
unto him, through perſonall love, and of their voluntary accord,
but enſlav'd through force; they will not care, if they find an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
for their owne ſafety, and releaſe from him, if they ſell
him into the hands of their greateſt enemies, or lay violent hands on
his perſon themſelves, as it often is; yea, and for the moſt part,
there is few Tyrants that eſcape murther, or juſt execution, but it
is their end.</p>
            <p>By the juſt judgement of the merciful God, who loveth mercy,
but hateth cruelty, wrong, and tyranny, and will avenge it, though
juſtice faile in the hands of men, one time or other, look <hi>Iſai.</hi> 14.
18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23. Look alſo <hi>verſ.</hi> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. <hi>For the ſame meaſure, that men mete
unto others; the ſame ſhall be meaſured unto them again.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But why ſhould I wonder, to ſee us all prone to be ambitious,
proud, haughty; ſeeing we are not fully and throughly rational,
but in a great meaſure lead with ſenſuality.</p>
            <p>But were we throughly rational, how could we be proud, that
are duſt and aſhes, and know our ſelves ſuch, and that we are but
mortal?</p>
            <p>Seeing he alone, who is the only Potentate, the King of Kings,
and Lord of Lords, hath immortality, and dwelleth in light which
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97084:11"/>
is inacceſſible, which no man can approach unto, whom no man
hath ſeen, nor can ſee; to whom alone be aſcribed, honour and
power everlaſting, <hi>Amen, Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But thus much briefly, by way of Introduction, or preambula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to what I chiefly intend to fall upon, as of all points moſt
meet and neceſſary, to be inſiſted on in theſe contentious, quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rellous,
and perillous times: I mean, in regard of that great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſention,
that is now amongſt us, about the Churches Government,
and diſcipline, &amp;c. Concerning which, I ſhall endeavour, through
the grace of God, to keep cloſe to the principles that I have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed,
and that as briefly as may be. And ſhall caſt in alſo even this
poor mite into the Churches Treaſury, and that by way of propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal,
as ayming chiefely at the proper end, which is the end of the
Commandement, as hath been ſaid.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For without all controverſie, That which is the end of all the
Commandements, ſhould be all our ends, in all our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
and undertakings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But the undoubted end of all the Commandements, is doubtleſs,</hi> [Love] <hi>out of a pure heart, and good Conſcience, and Faith
unfeigned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This therefore being the proper end; I ſhall hold it forth in all
the means, that I ſhall propoſe, from the Law of God; and
ſhall carry it along in my own intention; and alſo make it
manifest, as much as poſſible, how ſuch meanes, properly
tendeth to atchieve that end; and how uſeful and neceſſary
ſuch means is, to attain there unto, the Lord aſſiſting: who
is able to do it, and to make it clear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. And firſt then, becauſe it do appeare to be againſt <hi>[Love]
To God above all, and our Neighbours as our ſelves.</hi> It is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to be rejected; for even the whole Law is contained in this;
Yea, what ever it be that is againſt <hi>Love,</hi> is againſt <hi>God;</hi> for <hi>God
is Love, and Love cometh of God; and is ſhed abroad in our
hearts by the holy Ghost;</hi> and if we be partakers of this divine
love which is ſhed in our hearts, by the Holy Ghoſt; <hi>We are made
partakers of the godly nature;</hi> and it is of all others, the firſt
and chiefeſt of thoſe fruits of the Spirit, and the moſt eſſentiall,
1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 7, 8, 12, 13, 16, 17. And ſo is a clear evidence, <hi>That God
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:97084:11"/>
dwelleth in us, and we in him;</hi> for the love of God is eſſentially
of God, ſuch love, I meane as cometh of God.</p>
            <p>2. And ſecondly, If it do appear to be againſt this love, out of a
pure heart; it is alſo worthy to be rejected; for what ever Law,
Doctrine, or argument ſhall be propoſed, to oblige men to in purity,
either in heart, or life, It is without all controverſie againſt the Law
of God; for <hi>Bleſſed are the pure in heart, for they ſhall ſee God,</hi> and
men ought to keep themſelves pure, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 8. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 22. Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in heart, for thereout cometh the iſſues of life.</p>
            <p>3. Thirdly, if it be propos'd againſt a good Conſcience, it is
worthy to be rejected, as not included in the Law of God.</p>
            <p>For all Laws, Doctrines, or Arguments, whatſoever they are
that would ingage us againſt a good Conſcience, manifeſtly groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
on the Word of God, and of ſound Doctrine, that cannot
be reproved; we ought to reject them, and yeeld no obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
nor approbation thereunto, either in obedience unto men,
or to pleaſe them, &amp;c. For we muſt not be men pleaſers, nor ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of men, but obey God rather then men; and ought to
love, and therefore ſerve, and honor, and pleaſe him, rather then
men. For all the men in the whole Univerſe, cannot by any
meanes give men liberty of Conſcience to commit ſinne; if
their Conſcience tell them, and be convinced from the Law
of God, that they ought not to do it, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 11, 12, 13,
14, 15.</p>
            <p>But their Conſciences, will accuſe, and condemne them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo;
and that in the day of Judgement, when God ſhall Judge
the ſecrets of men, by JESUS CHRIST, according to the
Goſpel.</p>
            <p>Therefore, as they cannot properly give men liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcince,
no more then ſave, and exempt men from puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
due for their ſinnes againſt Conſcience; they ought not
to binde, or engage men to obedience unto any Law, againſt
a good Conſcience, rightly grounded on the Law of God, as
hath been ſaid; But ſhould give men libertie, to be as ſtrict
and ſevere, and as carefull, and watchful, and as inquiſitive
is they pleaſe, how to keep a good Conſcience, voyd of offence
both to God and men.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:97084:12"/>
4. Fourthly, if any Law, or argument, or motion whatſoever,
ſhall be made againſt Faith; to wit, unfaigned Faith, As that we
ſhould not beleeve or truſt in God, but in ſomething elſe; or that
we ſhould beleeve, or put hope and confidence in any thing elſe; or
that we ſhould not beleeve whatſoever he ſaith, or propoſeth to us
in his ſacred Word, or biddeth us beleeve, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We ought to reject
it; yea, though all the men and Churches in the World, would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
us to beleeve, what they aſſert and reſolve upon, as being
moſt able, becauſe wiſe and learned; and becauſe a multitude of
Counſellors to determine and reſolve, what ought to be beleeved in
ſuch a caſe.</p>
            <p>Yet if we certainly know, that the Word of God affirmeth the
contrary; we ought to beleeve it, and to reject their reſolves, and
counſels and aſſertions, be they what they will; and muſt not
conform, nor comply with them, nor approve the ſame. But if an
Angel from heaven, or the whole world being become an <hi>Arrian,</hi>
ſhould decree, or teach us, the <hi>Arrian</hi> hereſie, we ſhould let him
be accurſed; and ſo alſo for any other Doctrine, then may be made
manifeſt, as it ought to be, from ſacred Scripture.</p>
            <p>There is a time ſpoken of <hi>Zach.</hi> 13. when men ſhall be ſo zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
againſt falſe Prophets, and falſe Propheſying, that a mans fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and his mother that begat him, ſhall ſay unto him, thou ſhalt
not live; for thou ſpeakeſt lyes in the name of the Lord; and his
father and his mother, that begat him, ſhall thruſt him through,
when he propheſie, <hi>Zach.</hi> 13. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.</p>
            <p>We muſt therefore reſolve, to let God be true, and every man a
lyar, and therefore rather to beleeve him, then all, and every, or any
man in the whole world. And alſo we muſt and ought to draw
neer unto God, in full aſſurance of Faith, not caſting away our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
in God, which hath great recompence of reward; for faith
in God is of all other graces, Love excepted, the moſt chief and
principal, and the moſt eſſential; for it is ſaid of Faith and
Love, that they are in Chriſt Jeſus; yea, though now in heaven. It
is not ſaid, that they were in Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to wit, when he was on earth,
but that they are in Chriſt Jeſus; for when the Apoſtle writ ſo of
him, he was aſcended already into heaven; yea, and though he be in
heaven, yet he is ſaid to dwel in mens hearts by Faith.</p>
            <p>And therefore ſuch faith may well be called a precious
faith, being ſo properly eſſential to the ſpirit of Chriſt; as that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:97084:12"/>
where Faith dwelleth, Chriſt alſo dwelleth properly and eſſentially,
even by his holy ſpirit: for faith and love, which are in Chriſt Jeſus,
are not onely fruits, but they are eſſentiall witneſſes of his holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
abiding in us: <hi>He that beleeveth</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>hath the
witneſſe in himſelf:</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 10. And ſo he that loveth, it is alſo
a witneſs <hi>that he is born of God, and knoweth God, Chap.</hi> 4. 7. and
that <hi>he alſo dwelleth in us,</hi> verſ. 12. and that <hi>he hath given us of
his ſpirit,</hi> verſ. 13. And ſo <hi>That we are made partakers of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
nature,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 4. and have in ſome meaſure, even the mind of
Chriſt, and the ſpirit of Chriſt, though yet but in meaſure, becauſe
of our finite capacities: whereas in Chriſt, even the fulneſs of the
Godhead dwelleth bodily, or rather eſſentially.</p>
            <p>Therefore it follows, That what ever Arguments, or Laws, or
Doctrines, make againſt Faith, or that but tend to the weakning
thereof, or that would hinder our edifying, and being built up in
faith and love, which are in Chriſt Jeſus; ſhould utterly be reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
as ungodly, unjuſt, untrue, oppoſite, and contradictory to the
Law of God, and to his Sacred Word, which is one, and cannot be
broken, nor alleged properly for ſuch an end; And therefore theſe
foure Rules may ſtand as cautions, that we admit not any thing,
contrary hereunto; though it ſhould be urged, and preſented to us,
or propoſed, or commanded, in the name of God; or as being
grounded on his ſacred Word: For it it croſſe, or oppoſe, or would
deprive us, or make void to us this end of the Commandement, to
wit, Love out of a pure heart, and good conſcience, and faith un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fained;
it is falſe, and wicked, and that which will not ſtand with
the Law it ſelf, and therefore ought to be rejected of all good men:
And therefore with full purpoſe to keep to theſe Rules, as the end
alſo of what I do intend, I ſhall further propoſe theſe enſuing
Grounds and Arguments, both as intending and tending to a Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation,
and full Agreement of the Church of God, in reſpect of
Government, and the Diſcipline thereof, as hereafter follows.</p>
            <p>1 <hi>Ground</hi> is, That it is lawful, yea, and the bounden duty of ſome
men, and of ſome women, to be more abſtenious from things lawful
in themſelves, and to bind themſelves to a ſtricter Diſcipline then
others need to engage themſelves, or be bound unto, or be abſteni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

For the Kingdom of heavens ſake, that is to ſay, That they
might be more free, both from the cares of this life, and from all
carnal engagements, or diſturbances, or diſtractions, and induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
whatſoever; that might either trouble, or moleſt them, or
engage their mindes, or withdraw their affections, or hinder their
devotions, both of bodies and ſpirits, in reſpect of God.</p>
            <p>But that they might fully conſecrate, and devote themſelves, both
ſoules and bodies, to the ſacred government of his grace and ſpirit;
that the Kingdom of God, by his grace and ſpirit, might have full
ſcope and dominion in them, both of their ſoules and bodies; and
that they might more freely attend, and waite on the Lord, without
ſeparation, or without diſturbance, or cumber, or diſtraction, by any
meanes: But might glorifie God both in their bodies and ſpirits:
And that with all their hearts, with all their ſouls, with all their
minds, and with all their ſtrength, as ſo the Law of God requires
they ſhould. For this is the meaſure of our love to God, that the
Law requires, and that Chriſt exemplified, and commanded like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
that he that can receive this, ſhould receive it.</p>
            <p>And it is alſo the Apoſtle <hi>Pauls</hi> advice, by the ſpirit of <hi>God,</hi> as
<hi>better</hi> for ſuch, who <hi>can</hi> abſtain that they ſhould not marry, if

this alſo the Apoſtle exemplified, and wiſhed that all men were

            <p>And thus therefore, I hope that no man will deny, but that it
were better for <hi>ſome,</hi> both men and women; ſuch eſpecially, who
have the gift of continencie, to abſtain from Marriage, and make

1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 1.</p>
            <p>And yet for all this, <hi>Marriage is honourable amongst all men,

with God, after he begat Methuſelah, three hundred years,
and begat ſons and daughters, Gen.</hi> 22. 24. Of whom it was wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed,
<hi>That he had pleaſed God, and that he was therefore tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated,
that he ſhould not ſee death, Hebr.</hi> 11. 5. And it was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
for <hi>Peter</hi> to lead about a wife, a ſiſter, and ſo for the brethren
of the Lord, and <hi>Cephas.</hi> And <hi>Zachary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> were both
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:97084:16"/>
righteous before the <hi>God,</hi> walking in the Commandements, and
Ordinances of the Lord blameleſs, as <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 5, 6.</p>
            <p>And <hi>David</hi> was a man after Gods own heart, ſave in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah:</hi> and yet had many Wives, and Concubines: And
<hi>Adam</hi> in Innocency, before he ſinned, had his wife, and was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<hi>to be fruitfull, and multiply, and repleniſh the earth, &amp;c.</hi>
And how elſe ſhould men be multiplied, and ſucceed, &amp;c. but by
means of procreation, as God hath ordained, and appointed, and
called men; as doubtleſs, he hath, ſome after this manner, and ſome
after that: For it were a wicked Antichriſtian Doctrine, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
to marry, or to command to abſtaine from meats, which God
hath commanded, to be received with thankſ-giving, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.
3, 4, 5.</p>
            <p>But ſuch who are ſo called, and inclin'd for marriage, are not
very ſuitable for conſociation with ſuch-as make themſelves chaſte,
nor they for them, in theſe reſpects.</p>
            <p>2. And ſecondly, It is lawful for ſome, to give all their goods
unto the poor, and to give their bodies to be burned, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 3.
And in caſe, when called of God, and required ſo to do, it is their
duty.</p>
            <p>For the young man in the Goſpel, ought to have done ſo, as Chriſt
adviſed him, that he might be perfect. And it had been good for
him ſo to have done; for in conſideration thereof, he might have
had treaſure in heaven, and have followed Chriſt, <hi>Math.</hi> 19. 21.</p>
            <p>And alſo, <hi>Whoſoever will ſave his life,</hi> (when Chriſt calleth him
to part with it) <hi>ſhall loſe it; but whoſoever ſhall loſe it for his
ſake, ſhall finde it, Math.</hi> 16. 24, 25, 26. and <hi>Math.</hi> 10. 32, 33,
34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39.</p>
            <p>And it is lawfull for ſuch, who are of one heart, and of one ſoul,
to have all things common, and not to title, or claime any thing,
that any of ſuch poſſeſſeth as his own, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 32. But ſuch, amongſt
ſuch, as are poſſeſſors of Lands, may lawfully ſell them, and bring
the price thereof, and lay it down at the Miniſters feet; that diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution
may be made unto every man, <hi>(amongst them)</hi> according as
he hath need; as <hi>verſ.</hi> 34. 35. 37. but this community is only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
amongſt ſuch as are of one heart.</p>
            <p>And yet for all this, He that provideth not for his own, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
them of his houſhold, he is worſe then an Infidel. And riches are
given to ſome, as great bleſſings; as to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:97084:17"/>
               <hi>Salomon,</hi> and <hi>Joab,&amp;c.</hi> and it is a more bleſſed things to be a giver,
then a receiver.</p>
            <p>And men have a true and juſt propertie in their own goods, or
eſtates, as <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 4. and it is in their own power, neither ought
any to be compelled to ſuch community of goods, and eſtates; nor
to diſtribute and communicate, but as they doe it freely, of their
own voluntary minds without grudging, or any impulſion, as of
neceſſity, either to the poor, or to the Miniſtery, as <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 6, 7, 8,
9, 10. and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the Apoſtle moved
them; not as ſpeaking by commandement, but by reaſon of the
forwardneſs of others, and the Example of Chriſt, who being rich,
for their ſakes became poor; that they through his poverty might
be rich, as <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. And that ſupplying
each others, there might be equallity, as <hi>Verſ.</hi> 14. 15. as doubtleſs,
to ſuch who are mutually affected, it is no more, but equal, and
therefore a duty, but otherwiſe not, but were a ſin.</p>
            <p>3. It is lawful for a man to beat down his body, and to bring it
in ſubjection, by faſting, and by labour and travaile night and day,
as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is not unlawfull to faſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten;
yea, twice in the week, like the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yea, it is lawful for man and wife to defrande one another,
with conſent, for a time; that <hi>they may give themſelves unto fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
and prayer,</hi> ſo they come together again; <hi>That Satan tempt
them not, for their incontinency,</hi> as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 5. And they that do
thus, doubtleſs may ſee cauſe for it, why they ſhould faſt (ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times)
when they give themſelves unto prayer. As firſt, becauſe
when the ſtomack is empty, the whole ſtrength of the ſoul, and
ſpirit, is ſet at liberty; (It not being bent and imployed in digeſtion
of meat.) That with full bent of all the powers, and faculties, both
of ſoul and body, they may ſtrive and wreſtle with God in prayer,
and be the more faithfull and confident; and the more capable and
apprehenſive of ſpiritual underſtanding: for when the ſtomach is
burthened and cloyed with meat, the ſtrength of the ſpirit is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily
engaged, for digeſtion of the ſame; and makes the minde
drowſie, and dull, and the more uncapable, and unfit for Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
and fellowſhip with God, and for the preſence and power of
his holy Spirit, working therein, and acting, and exerciſing, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging
the ſame, according to his will; making requeſt for the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:97084:17"/>
Saints, according to the will of <hi>God,</hi> even with ſight, and groans,
that canned be expreſſed.</p>
            <p>It is therefore meet, upon ſerious occaſions, of ſeeking unto
<hi>God,</hi> that we faſt and pray, with fulneſs of devotion, and ferven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
of ſpirit, if we would obtain.</p>
            <p>And ſecondly, in regard that ſome things are not attainable;
ſome kind of Devils not caſt out, but by faſting and prayer, <hi>Mar.</hi>
9. 29. which cleerly implies, that faſting and prayer jointly, are
more powerfull and prevalent with <hi>God,</hi> then when ſevered, as
prayer only.</p>
            <p>And yet for all this, it was lawful for <hi>Peter,</hi> and the reſt of the
Apoſtles to eat and drink, &amp;c. and who could eat, or who elſe could
haſten unto outward things, more then wiſe <hi>Salomon,</hi> who ſeriouſly
concludes; <hi>That there is nothing better for a man, then that he
ſhould eat and drink, and he ſhould make his ſoul to enjoy the fruit
of his labour; and this he ſaw, that it was of the hand of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For <hi>God</hi> giveth to a man that is good in his ſight, Wiſdom, and
knowledge, and Joy; but to the ſinner, he giveth travaile; to
gather, and to heap up, that he may give to him, that is good before
<hi>God, Eccleſ.</hi> 2. 24, 25, 26.</p>
            <p>And the Lord Jeſus, even Chriſt himſelfe, as his own words do
plainly declare; that contrary to the practice of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptist,</hi>
He <hi>the Son of man came eating, and drinking,</hi> eating bread, and
drinking wine; inſomuch that they ſaid of him, <hi>Behold a gluttenous
man, and a wine-bibber, a friend of Publicans and ſinners,</hi>
Luke 7. 34.</p>
            <p>And the Diſciples of <hi>John</hi> faſted often, but his Diſciples faſted
not whiles he was with them.</p>
            <p>And therefore it follows; that as there is diverſities of gifts, and
of adminiſtrations, and operations given out by the ſelf ſame Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
dividing to every man ſeverally as he will.</p>
            <p>Even ſo accordingly, men are called of <hi>God,</hi> one after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and another after that; and have ſo alſo their proper gifts of
<hi>God,</hi> as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 7. And as <hi>God hath diſtributed to every man,
as the Lord hath called every one, ſo he ought to walk, for ſo the
Apostle ordained in all Churches,</hi> as <hi>verſ.</hi> 17.</p>
            <p>And therefore it follows, that it muſt not be expected, that
every man ſhould be alike abſteneous from the things of this life;
not bind themſelves to ſo ſtrict a diſcipline, both over their bodies
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:97084:18"/>
and minds, &amp;c. as ſome others, both will, and can, and ought,
to doe.</p>
            <p>4. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> after the moſt ſtrict Sect of the Jewiſh
Religion, he lived a Phariſee; which clearly implies, that at leaſt,
there were three that were ſeveral Sects of the Jewiſh Religion; of
which the Phariſees were the ſtricteſt; and yet they were all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
men, and of the true Religion too: there were Scribes, and
Phariſees, and Saduces, and all religious and zealous alſo in their
own wayes, and according to their own Traditions, and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines;
though they ſomething differed amongſt themſelves;
yet they were all tolerated by the Civil State; and the Civil State
was not reprehended either by <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptist,</hi> or by Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
for ſuch toleration: but their falſe Doctrines, and Covetouſneſs,
and Hypocriſie, were reproved, and ſharply too.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Conſequence,</hi> And therefore it follows, That all ought not
to be compell'd to engage themſelves, to ſo ſtrict, and holy,
and ſevere a diſcipline, as ought to be tolerated, and practiſed
by others who can embrace, and freely engage to endure the
ſame, conſidering theſe grounds before named.</p>
            <p>2. And ſecondly it follows, That a ſtricter Diſcipline ought
to be tolerated by the Civil Magiſtrate; that ſuch who pleaſe,
and can freely accord, to engage themſelves to the exerciſe
thereof, (amongſt themſelves) may have liberty to doe it:
provided they offer not to inforce their way.</p>
            <p>Then ought to be impoſed, or made as a general, and bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Rule, or way of Government, to which all muſt neceſſarily
be ingaged in or bound unto.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſon.</hi> For it is the <hi>Duty</hi> of ſome men, as hath been ſaid,
to bind themſelves to a ſtricter Diſcipline then others need, or
ought to doe. The one being qualified, through the grace of
God, and fitted for it; and ſo manifeſtly ingaged and called
of God, ſo to doe: but the other not qualified; nor ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
through the grace of God, are manifeſtly, engaged, and
called of God, to the quite contrary, as in theſe foure Inſtances,
above written.</p>
            <p>1. Concerning Chaſtity or Marriage.</p>
            <p>2. Concerning community of goods, or claiming of propriety.</p>
            <p>3. Concerning faſting, or eating and drinking.</p>
            <p>4. Concerning being of the ſtricteſt Sect of the true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:97084:18"/>
ſuch as was the Pharſees; or of one more remiſs, ſuch as was
the Scribes.</p>
            <p>But it will be demanded, how theſe may be applicable to the
matter in hand?</p>
            <p>I anſwer, that as the caſe ſtands betwixt man and man in theſe
particulars; ſo it doth alſo betwixt Church and Church: for they
are all governed by the ſame Law, and by the ſame Spirit, and
the caſe is the ſame in every reſpect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>1. For ſuch who make themſelves chaſte for the Kingdom
of Heavens ſake, <hi>it is good for ſuch not to touch a Woman,</hi>
as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 1. And therefore they ought to be carefull how they
carry themſelves in ſuch reſpects. And it is not lawful for ſuch to
marry, if they ſo reſolve, and know they have power over their own
wills, as hath beer ſaid before.</p>
            <p>Even ſo a Church being rightly conſtituted, and having Divine
power, and authority given her, through faith in God, and the
Lord Jeſus Chriſt: And that deſires to be preſented, as a chaſte
Virgin onely unto Chriſt, and to be governed by him. It is not
lawful, for ſuch a Church, or at leaſt, not good for her, to
binde her ſelfe, to be ſubject to the Vote, or power and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction
of other Churches that are not conſtituted as a chaſte
Virgin onely unto Chriſt; and to be ruled by him, and by his
Word and Spirit.</p>
            <p>Or if they be not reſolved, to be as chaſt as ſhe, and as fully
ſubject to the Rules, and Laws, and waies of Chriſt, but think
they ought to conſociate with ſuch, who are more looſe in their
Doctrine, and Government, and ways, &amp;c. which as yet ſhe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
reſolve to do, upon any principles ſhe hath yet received from
Chriſt her head.</p>
            <p>And there is a reſemblance nto a little remarkable, held forth to
us by the Holy Ghoſt, betwixt the <hi>Huſband and Wife, and
Christ and his Church, Epheſ.</hi> 5. 22. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> both of them, being bound
to be ſubject alike, <hi>though yet in the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as it is ſo, that there is cauſe of Jealouſie, that ſome Women
will not continue chaſte. So there is cauſe of Jealouſie, that ſome
Churches will not be eſpouſed unto one Husband: that they
may be preſented, as a chaſte Virgin to Chriſt; but their minds
will be corrupted from the ſimplicity that is in Chriſt, as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi>
11. 2, 3, 4.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:97084:19"/>
Secondly, As it is with a man, as hath been ſaid, ſo it is with
a Church, in the ſecond particular: For, if a particular Church
ſhall amongſt themſelves, being of one heart, and of one minde,
have all things common, and none of them claime propriety
of goods, as meerly his own; but that they may be diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
as every one hath need. As ſo it is lawful, if they can ſo
agree, and do it freely without grudging, or repining: yet it were
unlawful, and a folly, and madneſs, to joyne themſelves ſo in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity
of goods, to ſuch in whom they could not expect the like
community, they being quit of a contrary minde, and heart, &amp;c.
like <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphirah,</hi> covetous and hypocritical, and only
ayming at carnal ends.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, And ſo likewiſe, as it lawful for a particular man, to
give themſelves much unto faſting and prayer, as hath been ſaid.</p>
            <p>Even ſo it is likewiſe, for a particular Church, if they ſo agree
amongſt themſelves, to give themſelves much unto faſting and
payer, as in their apprehenſion, they ſhall think they have cauſe; for
the good of their ſoules, in general or particular.</p>
            <p>Where it may be on the contrary, ſome other Churches, in their
apprehenſions, have more cauſe of thankfulneſs; finding for the
preſent, that the Bridegroom is with them. As ſo for this reaſon,
the Diſciples of Chriſt faſted not, whereas the Diſciples of <hi>John</hi>
faſted often.</p>
            <p>And why then, ſhould Churches of different judgments, in theſe
reſpects, be bound by Authority, all to rejoyce, or all to mourn, and
faſt, and pray, at the ſame times, and no more frequently; but as
all can agree, ſo to humble themſelves.</p>
            <p>And how ſhould it chuſe, but ingage men to hypocriſie, ſave on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in caſe of ſome general judgment, of which we are certain, that
all are ſencible and affected with it.</p>
            <p>And fourthly, and laſtly, As it is lawful for a particular man, to
be of the ſtricteſt Sect of the true Religion, ſuch as were the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees.</p>
            <p>So it is lawful for a particular Church, to be of the ſtricteſt way,
in reſpect of Government, Doctrine, and Diſcipline, that can be
deviſed, or made good from Scripture, as lawful, &amp;c. And the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate
ought not to enforce her, to conform unto any Churches,
that are more remiſſe and looſe, or careleſs, or not ſo ſtrict, or care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
and conſcientious, as they ought to be.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:97084:19"/>
Though I will not deny, But the Magiſtrate ought to tollerate,
ſuch who think they ought not to be ſo ſtrict, as well as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>For as all good men whoſe general bent, is the glory of God;
cannot attain ſuch meaſures, or degrees of grace, and wiſdom, as of
faith and holineſs, and of zeal, &amp;c. one as another.</p>
            <p>Even ſo all Churches, though they be true Churches, cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
attain, to be ſo rightly conſtituted, and ſo ſevere, and ſtrict, in
Diſcipline, and Government, and Doctrine, &amp;c. as others can,
though the ſtricter, the better, in ſome reſpect, as I ſhall hereafter
ſhew; though in ſome things to be over ſtrict is a foule fault. The
one conceiving, that they ought to proceed, according to the rule
of charity, and the other of certainty. The one expecting, but faith
Hiſtorical, in their admiſſions; But the other ſearching, for Faith
Juſtifying, ſuch as appeares by Works, in all ſuch whom they doe
approve. As there is ſtrong Arguments, that might eaſily be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
on both patties, even from ſacred Scripture, that it is not eaſie to
reconcile. I hope, they will not ſay, that either of them yet, have
clearly demonſtrated, from ſacred Scriptures, their owne reſolves
concerning Baptiſme: I ſhall therefore, it may be, propoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them; ſomething of that.</p>
            <p>But from theſe precedent grounds, Firſt, it is clear, that theſe
concluſions, will juſtly reprove, and, I hope, convince, both the
<hi>Independents,</hi> and <hi>Preſbyterians;</hi> in that they do not labour to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
and love, and ſtrive to live and carry as Bretheren, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
together in all the Ordinances, as Bretheren ought, and
as occaſion ſerves. But the one ſtriving to enforce conformity to
their wayes, and rules, and principles, &amp;c. to which (in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence)
they, it may be, are engaged. And the other, blaming, and
condemning them, as too remiſſe, and not ſo upright and conſcienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
nor walking by ſo juſt and ſtrict a rule, in conſtitution, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and diſcipline of the Congregations, as they ought to
do, and as they are reſolved to engage themſelves, and therefore ſeek
for liberty ſo to do.</p>
            <p>By this means they fall at varience, and fall out by the way, and
about the way, though they be Bretheren, and ſo doe know, and
acknowledge each other.</p>
            <p>And firſt then, let them both conſider, this falling out by the
way, is not (like) as they were bretheren, for by this ſaith Chriſt,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:97084:20"/>
               <hi>All men ſhall know that ye are my Diſciples; If ye love one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</hi>
Is this like love, which is the end of the Commandement,
as is before propoſed, even thus to bite, and devoure, and deſtroy
one another? And all becauſe that both parties, but ſeeing in part,
and knowing in part, and underſtanding in part, are of different
Judgements. As ſo they are likely as yet to be in ſome thing or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
whiles it is ſo with them, as that they are not perfect, till that
which is in part ſhall be done away.</p>
            <p>And what then, will they never agree, till they all be perfect?
will they never love, till in every particular, they be of one judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</p>
            <p>But it will be objected, that men who think themſelves in a
right way, and others wrong; and holding forth their arguments
from cleare Scripture grounds that are ſufficient to convince them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:
They are apt to think that the other are obſtinate, and that
they ſee, and will not ſee, nor acknowledge the truth: ſo that they
cannot chuſe but be in a great meaſure out of charity with them:
as accounting them perverted, and men that ſin, being damned of
their own conſciences.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, That if we can know for certain, after once
or twice admonition, that men ſinne, being damned of their own
conſciences, it is a foule thing, <hi>Such ought to be rejected,</hi> Tit. 3.
10, 11.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But ſuch muſt be known to be Hereticks, and obſtinate, &amp;c.
And therefore obſerve the nature of love in this kind, that we be
not cenſorious, and too too injurious, in judging our bretheren in
this kind. For</hi> Charity, <hi>(ſaith the Apoſtle)</hi> ſuffereth long, and is
kind: Charity envieth not, nor vanteth not it ſelf, nor <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> it pufft
up: doth not behave it ſelf unſeemly; ſeeketh not her own, is not
eaſily provoked, thinketh no evill: Rejoyceth not in iniquity, but
rejoyceth in the truth; beareth all things, beleeveth all things,
hopeth all things, endureth all things, &amp;c. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 4, 5, 6, 7.</p>
            <p>And ſeeing that all theſe are natural properties of that love which
is the end of the Commandment: Let us try our ſelves by all theſe
properties, whether we have behaved, and carried our ſelves ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
towards ſuch, before we cenſure, and let our hearts looſe,
to reject and oppoſe, and deal with them as enemies of God. We
ought not to hate, nor to deal with ſuch as enemies at all; but to
love, and pitty, and pray for them; and acknowledge them bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:97084:20"/>
and admoniſh them as brethren, though they ſeem to walk
diſorderly, and obey not the Word even of God himſelfe in ſome
things, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3. 14, 15. and <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 44, 45, 46, 47, 48.</p>
            <p>Though I doe confeſſe, that if any man love not the Lord Jeſus
Chriſt, he ought to be held even in execration, if it manifeſtly appear.
And we ought to contend earneſtly for the faith which was once
delivered to the Saints, <hi>Jud.</hi> 3. And we ſhould ſtand faſt to our
Chriſtian liberty wherewith Chriſt hath made us free, and not be
entangled again with yokes of bondage, nor ſuffer men to Rule
over us at their pleaſure, according to their own fancies, or arbitrary
wills, not ſubmitted to the Laws of God; nor holding to the head,
and to the foundation, &amp;c. <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 1. 18. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. 8, 9, 10,
11, 12, 16, 17, 18, 19, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſtill always, with due reſpect to their perſons; as pittying
their ignorance, weakneſs, infirmities, failings, and imperfections
that we diſcover in them. As conſidering our ſelves, leſt we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
be tempted, and that we alſo have been in like condition, in
one particular reſpect or another; having been erronious, and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apprehenſive,
and offenſive unto others, in ſuch reſpects: for who
that lives, but if he will examine, he may remember that he hath er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
from the truth, in ſome thing or other: and been reduced and
convinced by others; or by ſearching of the Scriptures have ſeen
our ſelves (as of our ſelves) ſubject to all, or to any error. And that
we ought to acknowledge, that it is of grace, and the gift of God;
that we are ſufficient, or able to know or underſtand any thing of
the things of God. And why then ſhould we be high minded, and
not rather fear, leaſt we alſo fall, or fail, &amp;c. of the grace of God?
Or why then ſhould we be too confident, either that we do not,
or that we cannot err?</p>
            <p>And if we do not expect, that men ſhould think ſo of us, why
are we ſo angry, that all men are not juſt on our minds? and that
they will not follow us, nor conforme unto us, juſt in our
wayes?</p>
            <p>Doth it not Imply, that we think of our ſelves above that which
is meet? to wit, that we cannot erre, and expect that others ſhould
thinke ſo likewiſe. And what is this leſſe then the Pope, that <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist,</hi>
and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> challenge to themſelves; and by
reaſon thereof exalt themſelves above the Magiſtrates, above all that
is called God, or that is worſhipped<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:97084:21"/>
Whereas on the contrary part, it is manifeſt, that the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the whole Chriſtian world, hath erred iexceedingly: Was
it not once ſaid, That the whole World was become an <hi>Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an?</hi>
Nay, were not all the oppoſers of the <hi>Arrian</hi> Hereſie,
in an error likewiſe, both one and another? to wit, thoſe that
maintained, That the Trinity of Perſons was one ſubſtance. For
though the <hi>Trinity of Perſons be one and the ſame in Eſſence,
yet they are not one ſubſtance,</hi> for the bleſſed Deity is all Eſſence,
as the Scripture is clear, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3. 14.</p>
            <p>I Am that I am: <hi>to wit, that</hi> He [Is,] is all Eſſence.</p>
            <p>But no proof can be made from Scripture ground; that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible
God is any ſubſtance at all, but an Infinite Eſſence, and not
locally circumſcriptible, as all ſubſtance is: but unlimitably exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent;
filling both all place, and every ſubſtance, both in heaven and
earth, and infinitely beyond them on every ſide: circumventing
all things, and filling all things, even from the very top of the higheſt
Heavens, to the middle, and bowels or center of the earth: and yet
he himſelf is not cirumvented, with any thing at all; no, not with
<hi>[place]</hi> it ſelf: in which, as Phyloſophers ſpeak, <hi>All things
ſtand:</hi> But is Infinite and unlimitable, without circumference, and
without center; the heavens of heavens are not able to containe
him, but he filleth all things: as the Scripture is clear, and as might
evidently and convincingly alſo be made to appeare to any rational
man, by Reaſons and Arguments, drawn from the motion and
government of all things, and conſtant courſe, and ſubſiſtence of
the heavens, and of the earth, and waters, and all viſible Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:
for who elſe is the efficient cauſe of their being, and ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence,
and of their motion, &amp;c. Look <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 18, 19, 20, 21. and
<hi>Pſalm.</hi> 19. 1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if all may erre, and every one hath erred; and it may be doth
erre in ſome thing or other: Then all and every particular man,
ought to fear himſelf, leſt he alſo do erre, and that in ſuch parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars,
wherein he thinketh, that he juſtly oppoſeth, and condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
others: And ought to ſearch the Scriptures, and to ſearch the
meaning of the Spirit, even in the Scripture it ſelf: and to be ſure
of that, before he be too confident, and ſurious in oppoſition, or
judging of others, as Hereticks, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He that thinketh he ſtandeth, take heed leſt he fall. He that
thinketh he knoweth any thing, knoweth nothing yet as he ought to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:97084:21"/>
know,</hi> ſaith the Spirit of God. Then we ought therefore to put
on Charity, which is the bond of perfectneſs: and not to break off
Love, but upon ſure grounds, that they are enemies of God, whom
we ſo judge, and cenſure, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But for more punctuall applycation of theſe precedent concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
unto both Parties, to wit, to the <hi>Independents</hi> and <hi>Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians,</hi>
I ſhall briefly aſſert theſe cleare conſequences from the
aforeſaid grounds: firſt to the one, and then to the other.</p>
            <p>And firſt then, to the <hi>Preſbyterians</hi> I aſſert as followeth, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half
of the <hi>Independents.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. That it is lawful yea and the bounden duty of ſome men,
to binde themſelves to a ſtricter diſcipline, then others need or
ought to do: The one being quallified, through the grace of God,
and fitted for it, and ſo manifeſtly ingaged, and called of God ſo
to do, for the time preſent, whiles they think they ought.</p>
            <p>2. To the <hi>Independents,</hi> that the <hi>Preſbyterians</hi> not being ſo qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified,
or diſpoſed, or called, through the grace of God; but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly
ingaged, to the quite contrary; And as is it were bound in
ſpirit, within their own ſphere, or place, or calling, or way, &amp;c.
ought ſo to continue, whiles they think they ought, till they be
convinced from Scripture grounds that it is their duty; and that
they are called of God, to a ſtricter Rule, and way of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline,
then they yet do practiſe; or can freely embrace, or engage
to indure, as witneſs the foure precedent examples.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conſiqu.</hi> And therefore it followes, That a ſtricter Diſcipline
ought to be tollerated, by the Civil State; that ſuch who pleaſe,
and can freely accord, to engage themſelves to the exerciſe thereof
amongſt themſelves, may have liberty to do it: provided alwaies,
that they do not offer to inforce others unto their way: but only
the freedom, and liberty of themſelves, and of their own, &amp;c. then
ought to be impoſed, and made as a general, and binding rule, and
way of Government; to which all muſt neceſſarily be ingaged
in, or bound unto: as hath been ſaid before.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But it will be Objected, ſeeing I propoſe this Aſſertion
to the <hi>Preſbyterians,</hi> in behalf of <hi>Independents;</hi> that it will be
neceſſary, that I ſhew wherein the <hi>Independents</hi> rules, and ways
of diſcipline, are ſtricter then theirs; for they are generally accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
by the <hi>Preſbyterians,</hi> more remiſs and looſe in many reſpects;
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:97084:22"/>
giving way for libertie of all Religions, without controule by the
Civil State, as ſo they ſpeak of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer that their rules and principles, according to
which they engage to act, are manfeſtly ſtricter, and lawfully too,
in divers particulars, wherein I ſhall briefly inſtance: And wherein
I thinke they are likewiſe ingaged, in duty and conſcience ſo to do,
though I will not deny, but many <hi>Preſbyterians</hi> are ingaged in
conſcience, to do the contrary, and are fully perſwaded, that they
ought ſo to do for the time preſent.</p>
            <p>1. And firſt, they are ſtricter with whom they incorporate, and
joyn themſelves in Church policy: And ſo far forth, as any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Church is politically joyned, for the government thereof, and
for the good of the body in every reſpect. A Church can never be
too ſtrict, but the ſtricter the better: and the more likely it is, to
be well ordered and governed, and built both in faith and love, and
all other graces and vertues whatſoever; that may tend for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
and good of the whole.</p>
            <p>And therefore, their principles are to admit none to be incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
with them, but men of approved fidelity: Becauſe accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their princples, they having liberty, and power in all Church
affairs, that are of joynt concernment, and that reſpect them all,
as in Elections, or Ejections, Admiſſions, or deprivations, Recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
or Rejections; Receiving in, or caſting out, from amongſt
themſelves, they all having intereſt, as members of the body, have
liberty, and power, for vote, or ſufferage, as they are bound in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
and can ſee juſt cauſe, and render a reaſon of their faith,
hope, or deſires therein; grounded upon Scripture evidence, as ſo
they ought to have. They, I ſay, according to their principles, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
this power and liberty, &amp;c. are bound to be ſtrict, with
whom they incorporate and joyn themſelves: Leſt by ſway of vote;
things ſhould be carryed Antichriſtian-wiſe, to the diſhonour of
God, and of the Church, &amp;c. by male adminiſtration of all the
Ordinances that concern them all, to be carefull of in the ſight of
God.</p>
            <p>For if men be admitted to have vote in Election of Miniſters, and
Elders, and Deacons, &amp;c. that are not approved, for ficelity and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
to diſcern, in ſome good meaſure, whether they be men of
good and honeſt report, and full of the holy Ghoſt, and of wiſdom,
ſuitable for ſuch a place; they may cauſe the Election and Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:97084:22"/>
of ſuch as will defile the Church with corrupt doctrine, and
unſound principles, and ways, and manners, to their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
            <p>And therefore all that are accounted to be truly religious, are not
fit to be incorporated, as members of the body, to have liberty and
power in ſuch reſpects, till they come to ripeneſs and maturity of
judgment in ſpiritual reſpects: In like caſe, as the <hi>Levites,</hi> though
they all were given as a gift unto <hi>Aaron</hi> and to his ſons, <hi>to do the
ſervice of the Tabernacle of the Congregation,</hi> yet they were not
to adminiſter and wait on the ſervice of the Tabernacle, but from
twenty and five years old, and up wards: And from the age of fifty
years they were to ceaſe waiting on the ſervice thereof, and ſhould
ſerve no more, as <hi>Numb.</hi> 8. 24, 25, 26. Clearly implying, That
onely in caſe of ripeneſs of judgment, and ableneſs, and fitneſs, for
ſuch a buſineſs, they ought to be uſed, and admitted, &amp;c. but not
otherwiſe, leaſt they ſpoyl the Government, of Diſcipline, and
Service, that belongs unto them: However, notwithſtanding, all
that are accounted to be truly religious, ought to be admitted unto
all the Ordinaces, yea, even to the Sacrament of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
though never ſo weak in underſtanding and knowledg, as all
the <hi>Levites,</hi> even during their minority; yet <hi>Aaron</hi> was appointed
to bring them with him, for they might be preſent, though they
did no ſervice: And through they might not adminiſter, and do the
ſervice of the Tabernacle, yet they might be admitted to come
neer with the reſt, and to offer for themſelves, though not for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
as the reſt of the Prieſts, as <hi>Numb.</hi> 18. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, &amp; Chap.
16. 45. So that whatſoever concerned but themſelves onely, they
might come neer, and approach to do it, (whereas no ſtranger might
intermeddle) though they might do no ſervice that concerned the
Tabernacle, till they came to years: But of this more fully in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
place.</p>
            <p>2. And ſecondly, As they are ſtricter with whom they do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporate,
and joyn themſelves, for theſe reſpects:</p>
            <p>Even ſo, for the ſame ends and reſpects, they are very ſtrict and
conſcientious, and ought ſo to be, that all that are found, and known
to be men of approved fidelity, ſhould thus incorporate and joyn
themſelves; I ſay, their principles are, that all ought ſo to do, that
live not too remote, but within convenient bounds, and in conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
numbers, for frequent aſſembling of themſelves together: and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:97084:23"/>
to engage themſelves in Covenant unto God, in theſe reſpects, and
unto all brotherly and Chriſtian duties, for better ſecurity, and
deeper engagement, both to God and men, not to deal unfaithfully
in all ſuch buſineſs, as concerns them all, but without partiality, or
reſpect of perſons, as before God, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and
the Elect Angels.</p>
            <p>And all the account will be little enough, in things that concern
the good of their ſouls, and the ſouls of poſterities, that may yet
ſucceed, to the end of the world; for whom they ought to provide,
and be careful for, that the Goſpel of peace, and of glad tydings,
and all the Ordinances, might be preached and adminiſtred, when
they are gone in power and purity, as well as to themſelves: And
to beware of dogs, and evil workers, and wolves, &amp;c. and as much
as poſſible, to keep them out, leaſt ungodly men, being crept in,
ſhould turn the grace of God into wantonneſs &amp;c. And this Goſpel
of peace, being a pearl ſo invaluable, as it were eaſie to ſhew, in every
reſpect, can never be guarded with too great ſecurity, or deep en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement,
nor too ſtrictly kept from being ſoyled or defiled with
the hands of men</p>
            <p>And though it be true, that the men of this world are wiſer in
their generations, (and for conſervation of their own liberties, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges,
pearls and eſtates, and to confirm and ſecure them, even to
their poſterities after them, if poſſible for ever,) then the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of light, as <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. 8. <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 24, 25. And may juſtly alſo
riſe up in judgment, and condemn our folly and careleſſneſs herein:
Yet no man will ſay but that the children of light ought to be as
wiſe in their generations, and in their precious things, and in the
things of God, and that concern their ſouls, for ſo we ought, even
<hi>to be wiſe as ſervants, though innocent as Doves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore to incorporate ſuch as ſtand approved, and are
men of fidelity, within convenient bounds, is doubtleſs the duty of
all, and every ſuch, in times of liberty, for publique adminiſtration
of the Ordinances of God, and for Government and Diſcipline:
And in times of perſecution, at the leaſt privately, they ought ſo to
do, without being reſtrained by the civil State, and limited, and
kept within parochial bonds, againſt their Chriſtian liberties, and
duties alſo, both to God, and men.</p>
            <p>3. And thirdly, The principles of Independents are ſtricter and
neerer to the Scripture rules for edifying of the Church; They do
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:97084:23"/>
not limit the holy one of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to ſpeak in publike by the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
onely: For firſt, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>The maniſestation of
the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 7.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aſſertion.</hi> From whence it naturally and manifeſtly flows,
That to whomſoever the manifeſtation of the Spirit is given, it
is given to ſuch to profit withal.</p>
            <p>It is objected. That the manifeſtation of the Spirit are not
ſo evident and perſpicuous in theſe days, as in the primitive
times; and the witneſſing thereunto by miracles is ceaſed, and
therefore we may eaſily be deceived; eſpecially ſuch who are
unlearned and unſtable, are eaſily deceived.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. I anſwer firſt, Whether any now adays hath the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtations
of the Spirit, yea, or no; yet this aſſertion is true,
for it doth not aſſert either.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 2. Secondly, I anſwer, That if the manifeſtations of
the Spirit be not evident and demonſtrable in theſe days, how
can even the learned Miniſters preach as they ought, and as the
Apoſtles did, in the clear evidence and demonſtration of the
Spirit, and of power, <hi>That ſo mens faith might not need to ſtand in
the wiſdom of men, but in the power of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 4. 5.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 3. Thirdly, Though for want of the witneſſing thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
by miracles, thoſe who are carnal and do not beleeve, cannot
diſcern the manifeſtations of the Spirit, and the power of God,
whereby men ſpeak, as Verſ. 8, 14.</p>
            <p>Yet for all that, they may ſpeak wiſdom among them that
are perfect; yea, even the wiſdom of God in a myſtery, even
the hidden wiſdom, which God hath ordained before the world
unto their glory; and thoſe ſecret myſteries, which eye hath
not ſeen, neither ear heard, &amp;c. which God hath prepared for
them that love him, he doth reveal unto ſuch by his Spirit, Verſ.
6, 7, 8, to 16.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conſequence.</hi> Such therefore, though they be unlearned in the
Tongues, (I mean) who having received the Spirit of God,
are thereby ſpiritualiz'd, <hi>may diſcern all things,</hi> as Verſ. 10, 15.
<hi>yea, even the deep things of God.</hi> Therefore it follows, That the
manifeſtations of the Spirit may be evident and demonſtrable,
even now in theſe days, to ſuch who are ſpiritualiz'd through
faith in God, though not to the carnal or worldly &amp;c. who do
account theſe ſpiritual things fooliſhneſs, as Verſ. 14. and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:97084:24"/>
wanting an eye of Faith, cannot diſcern them; becauſe they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible:
<hi>For as the light of the body is the eye,</hi> Matth. 6. 22, 23.
ſo the light of the Soul, whereby, and where-through it under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth,
or diſcerneth ſpiritual and inviſible things, is the eye of
Faith. For as God himſelf being inviſible, is only ſeen, or compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended,
and known through Fatih: ſo are alſo the <hi>things of God,
undiſcernable without Faith,</hi> Heb. 11.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> 1. But in what particular gifts, or qualifications, or
adminiſtrations, or operations, are the manifeſtations of the Spirit
of God, and of power, evident and demonſtrable in any that are
not learned in the tongues, now in theſe days?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, that many of thoſe, yea, and the chief of all
thoſe, that are reckoned up by the Apoſtle, and are by him aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
as manifeſtations of the Spirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 8, 9, 10. and <hi>Chap.</hi>
13. 3. are doubtleſs evident, and demonſtrable in ſome unlearned
in the tongues, even in theſe days.</p>
            <p>As 1. The word of Wiſdom. 2. The word of Knowledg.
3. Faith. 4. Propheſying; to wit, in ſpeaking unto men,
to edification, and exhortation, and comfort, which is the chief of
all. 5. Diſcerning of Spirits. 6. Interpretation of Scriptures,
that are dark and myſterious, and generally not underſtood.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> 2. But may not ſome men, by means of good Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
attain to a great meaſure of wiſdom and knowledge, even in
ſpiritual things: and ſo to the word of wiſdom, and of knowledge,
and to ſpeak unto men to Edification, and Exhortation, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort;
and yet not have the ſpirit of God, nor his power evidently
demonſtrable, as is aſſerted?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, No: <hi>For the natural man perceiveth not the
things of God, neither</hi> [can] <hi>he know them,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are ſpiritually diſcerned.</hi> And therefore he neither can
know them, nor ſpeak of them feelingly, and apprehenſively: but
only Theoretically; according to the largeneſs and capacity of his
memory: as he hath learned, and is grounded in the principles of
Religion, and of Faith, and Doctrine; as it were in a Catacheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
child-like manner; who can keep to the words, but know not
the ſence; And doe by Art of memory, ſpeak in the ſame words,
and phraſes, and manner, and form of doctrine with others. But
as for feeling apprehenſion, and ſpiritual underſtanding, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<hi>[indeed,]</hi> of what they ſpeak; they are utterly uncapable,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:97084:24"/>
whiles they want faith. And this is eaſie to diſcern, by their cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
on the one hand, or their zeal on the other, in delivery thereof:
And by their Emphatical, or looſe and light expreſſions, and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and motives, and meanes &amp;c. it is eaſie to diſcern, whether
a man ſpeak in ſpirit, that is to ſay, whether it come from the heart,
and affection; or but from the brain only. Neither is it eaſie to
counterfeit <hi>hearty affection,</hi> but it may eaſily be diſcern'd, that it
is but forc'd. A very Ideot may, by ſtrength of memory, ſpeak
the bare words of a Sermon, and rabble them over; but he cannot
keep to the diſtinct ſenſe of every period, according to the proper
intended Emphaſis, or meaning thereof; but may by improper pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods
and interceptions, make the ſence ſeem quite contrary to what
it is indeed: but a man that underſtands it, and is apprehenſively
affected, according to it, can expreſſe it ſuitable to the true intent
and meaning thereof.</p>
            <p>Even juſt ſo it is, betwixt men that are ſpiritual, through faith
in God; and ſuch as are carnal in all their expreſſions, concerning
ſpiritual things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But though it be difficult, and hard to counterfeit, yet it
may be done; ſo as few, or none, can diſcern, but they are as
ſpiritual and as ſound as others.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> What notes therefore is there to prove, for certain, and
that will evidence, and demonſtrate indeed, that it is the ſpirit of
God, that ſpeaks in ſuch, miracles excepted?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> There is many notes, by which men may be known, to
ſpeak <hi>in</hi> the Spirit, and <hi>by</hi> the Spirit of God. But ſome are more
certain and infallible then others. I ſhall therefore inſtance, in ſome
of the moſt certain: And thoſe that on purpoſe are given out, by
the Spirit of God, as evident demonſtrations, of the ſame Spirit,
and of power, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>1. And firſt, That note given out by the Lord Jeſus Chriſt
himſelf, is an evident demonſtration, that men are ſent of God, and
come not of themſelves; to wit, ſeeking his glory, (if that do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare)
For ſaith Chriſt, <hi>He that commeth of himſelf, ſeeketh his
owne glory; but he that ſeeketh his glory that ſent him, the ſame
is true, and no unrighteouſneſſe is in him,</hi> Joh. 7. 18. Their zeal
therefore for the glory of God, and ſelf-denial, is a manifeſtation
of the Spirit of God.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>That,</hi> Joh. 10. 10. The Thief commeth not, but for to
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:97084:25"/>
ſteale, and to kill, and to deſtroy. But the good ſhepherd <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
that they might have life, and have it more abundantly, <hi>to wit,</hi>
ſpiritual life; <hi>ſo that a deſire will appear in the good Shepherds;
that the ſheep of Chriſt might have</hi> A ſpiritual life, through faith,
and that they might be edified and built up further in the ſame
faith, even from ſtrength to ſtrength. <hi>And rather then ſaile of
this their ends, they will not ſtick to lay down, even</hi> their lives for
the good of their ſheep, <hi>as verſ.</hi> 11. <hi>But will continue to</hi> build
them up further in faith, and love, which are in Chriſt Jeſus:
<hi>as</hi> verſ. 28.</p>
            <p>3. The wiſdom which is from above, is firſt, pure; not dark,
and confuſed, darkning the councell with words without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
but <hi>pure words,</hi> Pſalm. 12. 6. 2. It is peaceable; not
wrangling, and froward, angry, and contentious. 3. It is gentle
and meeke; not ſowre, and proud, and harſh, and furious.
4. It is eaſie to be intreated; not ſelf-willed, and obſtinate, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durate
and implacable, but ingenious, and tractable. 5. It is full
of mercy, and good fruits, both in word and deed: and not cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,
and unmerciful, pittileſs, and careleſs of doing good; neither to
the juſt, nor unjuſt. Look <hi>Jam.</hi> 17. 18.</p>
            <p>4. It is the property of the holy Ghoſt, when he cometh, or
by whomſoever he ſpeaketh, <hi>To convince the world of ſin, of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,
and of judgement,</hi> Joh. 16. 8.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>And to lighten things that are hid in darkneſſe: and
make the councels of the hearts manifeſt;</hi> as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 5. and
<hi>Chap.</hi> 14. 24, 25. The firſt, by a clear unfolding, and interpreting
of ſacred Scriptures, that are dark, unto others, and not formerly
opened: and this of all others, is the moſt manifeſt evidence of the
Spirit of God. And ſecondly, a ſpeaking to the heart, and to the
ſouls and conſciences of men; diſcovring their very thoughts, and
councels: And approving themſelves, to every mans conſcience
in the ſight of God.</p>
            <p>6. Their comming to the light that their deeds might be made
manifeſt, that they are wrought in God, is a cleare evidence, that
they do truth, as <hi>John.</hi> 3. 21. their end appearing to be ſuch, that
they meane no falſhood.</p>
            <p>7. Their ſhining forth as lights in the world; and holding
forth the word of life, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 15. 16. <hi>Yea, even the faithful
word, that cannot be reproved: and making it manifeſt; as they
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:97084:25"/>
ought to do: for</hi> therefore they are called, the light of the
world: <hi>Marth.</hi> 5. 14. For all things that are reproved, are
made manifeſt by the light: for whatſoever doth make manifeſt,
is light, Epheſ. 5. 13, 14.</p>
            <p>But the chief of all theſe particulars, is a cleare underſtanding,
and knowledge of God, and of the ſacred Scriptures, and of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets
and miſeries of the Kingdom of God; for without all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie,
<hi>Great is the myſtery of godlineſſe,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith,
<hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 1. 26. 27, 28. <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 25. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3. 9. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 10. <hi>Tit.</hi>
1. 2. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 20.</p>
            <p>Reaſ. For to them that are without, and unbeleeving, all things
<hi>(ſaith Chriſt)</hi> are done in Parables, <hi>Luke</hi> 8. 10. <hi>and</hi> Mar. 4. 33,
34. Matth. 13. 11, 12, to 18.</p>
            <p>How much more then are the ſecret myſteries of God, and of
Chriſt, and of our ſpirituall union, and communion with him
(which is onely ſpiritual, through faith and love) Parables and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries
unto all ſuch, who have no knowledge of <hi>God</hi> at all; but
only as they have heard of him, by the hearing of the eare; or bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Theorettical, without an eye of Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conſiq.</hi> Therefore it follows; that he that ſpeaketh underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly,
and apprehenſively of theſe ſecret Myſteries; doth evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
demonſtrate, that he ſpeaketh by the Spirit, through the power
and grace of the Spirit of God; who onely revealeth, and giveth
underſtanding of the things of God; as hath been ſaid: ſo that it is
manifeſt, that it is not they that ſpeak, but the Spirit of their Father
that ſpeaketh in them. And by how much more they ſhall lighten
things, that are hid in darkneſs; and make the councels of the
hearts manifeſt, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 5. by the cleare unfolding, or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
of ſacred Scripture, and of the ſecrets thereof; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
ſuch as are dark and myſtical, and hid from others; or that
have not formerly been explained, and opened; or not convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cingly,
as a cleer reſult, producing an infallible aſſent.</p>
            <p>By ſo much the more evident, and demonſtrable it is; that it is
not they that ſpeak; <hi>but the Spirit of their Father that ſpeaketh
in them,</hi> Matth. 10. 19. 20. Yea, that they are ſent to ſpeak, or to
declare thoſe things, being thruſt forth, even by the Spirit of
Chriſt who dwelleth in them; and being <hi>Lord of the harveſt thruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
forth Labourers into his Hanvest.</hi> For how is it is poſſible,
that things that are hid from the wiſe and learned, ſhould be revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:97084:26"/>
even unto babes, and to the fooliſh, &amp;c. (in reſpect with this
world,) if they were not inspired, and revealed unto them by the
Spirit of God, ſeeing they have not learned them by humane docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
but from God onely.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But it will be objected, That it were immodeſty, yea
preſumption, and a tok<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n of ſpiritual pride in men, if they ſhould
ſo much as acknowledg, much leſs affirm, that they are taught of
God, and that immediatly, by the inſpiration of his bleſſed Spirit;
and that it is not they that ſpeak, but the Spirit of their Father
that ſpeaketh in them: But eſpecially for unlearned men, that are
but as babes, compared with the wiſe and learned, it were a
ſhameful thing in them to do it, above all compare.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, If they underſtand and know ſuch things
as have been ſaid, even the ſecrets and myſteries of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God, which they have not learned, not bin taught of men.</p>
            <p>To whom then ſhould they aſcribe the glory? Ought they
to aſcribe it to their own wiſdom? Dare the learned aſcribe
their ſpiritual underſtanding, and knowledge of God, and of the
things of God, either to their own wiſdom, or their learnedneſs
in the Tongues, which a carnal man may attain unto, that can
know nothing of the things of God, as hath been ſaid?</p>
            <p>Were this to give God the glory, and to do it as of the ability
that God adminiſtreth, that in all things God might be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied?
Were this to ſpeak as the Oracle of God, and in his
name? 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 11.</p>
            <p>Might not ſuch juſtly expect the judgment of <hi>Herod,</hi> to be
ſtruck with an Angel of the Lord, and to be eaten up of worms,
becauſe they give not the glory unto God of what they do or
ſpeak, in his ſacred name, that is good, or excellent, and true &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And it is doubtful, at leaſt, that ſuch who utterly exclude all
that are not learned in the tongues, I mean, from ſpeaking unto
men to edification, and exhortation, and comfort, or from any
miniſtration in the name of God in publique, eſpecially that they
thereby intimate, that their abilities for ſpiritual miniſtration are
onely attained through learnedneſs in the Tongues; for how elſe
durſt they be ſo bold, as to limit the holy one of Iſrael, that he
ſhall not ſpeak but by the learned onely?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But it will be objected, That ſpeaking unto men to
edification, and exhortation, and comfort, is not properly to
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:97084:26"/>
prophecy; for prophecying is properly foreſhewing of things
to come, though ſuch who prophecy, do ordinarily alſo ſpeak
unto men to edification, &amp;c. as well as prophecy of things to
come.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. I anſwer, firſt, That they that edifie the Church,
build them up in Faith; and Faith is of things inviſible, and
chiefly of things to come; For <hi>Faith is the ground of things ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
for, and the evidence of things not ſeen, Heb.</hi> 11. 1. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
edifying, or building men up further in the true faith, and
giving them better evidences and grounds of things hoped for
from ſacred teſtimonies, is, of all other, the chiefeſt prophecying,
and moſt uſeful, powerful, and comfortable, for giving life to
the ſouls of men, both in this life, and in the life to come, ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
life I mean, even joy and comfort unſpeakable and full of
glory, See <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 10. 28. and 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 11, 12, 13. Yea, for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting
of the Saints, as <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 11. to 16.</p>
            <p>2. And as for the other, as of foreſhewing new things to
come, as <hi>Agabus</hi> prophecyed of the dearth and famine over all
the world.</p>
            <p>Though it be a part of prophecying not ſo ordinarily attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
and more difficult in theſe days, yet it is not ſo needful
nor uſeful as the other: And though it be a more certain and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident
demonſtration of the ſacred Spirit inſpired into ſuch,
when the thing is accompliſhed and come to paſs; yet that part
of prophecying which the Apoſtle commends as the chief of all,
to wit, ſpeaking unto men to edification, &amp;c. is both far more
profitable, and a clearer evidence (for the time preſent) of the
Spirit of God, then the other is. And</p>
            <p>Therefore I ſay, firſt, it is the moſt preſent evidence, and moſt
immediate demonſtration of the ſpirit, and of power, becauſe
foreſhewing of things to come is no preſent and immediate e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
of it ſelf, till the things be come to paſs that are in truth
foreſhewed; though it is true, that foreſhewing of things to
come, is the very complement and perfection of prophecying,
and the moſt viſible demonſtration of the Spirit of God, as
<hi>Deut.</hi> 18. 22. and <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 13. when the things are accompliſhed.</p>
            <p>2. But, ſecondly, yet this <hi>prophecying</hi> intended by the <hi>Apostle,</hi> is
the moſt uſeful, and the moſt profitable of all other gifts, for the
edifying of the Church: And therefore ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:97084:27"/>
after Charity, and deſire ſpiritual gifts, but chiefly that ye
may prophecy.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 14. 1. And the reaſon is rendered Verſ. 3.
becauſe <hi>He that prophecyeth, ſpeaketh unto men to edification, and
exhortation, and comfort:</hi> which is the chief end of all gifts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <hi>For all that are zealous of ſpiritual gifts, ſhould ſeek that they
might excel to the edifying of the Church,</hi> as Verſ. 12. Although
the gift of tongues, and ſo alſo foreſhewing of things to come, is
a more evident demonſtration to convince them that beleeve not,
as Verſ. 22. yet look the end of all gifts, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 12. <hi>Epheſ.</hi>
4. 12. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 10, 11. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 6, 7, 8. for <hi>[that]</hi> ſhould be
our end. <hi>But prophecying,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>ſerveth not for them
that beleeve not, but for them that beleeve,</hi> Verſ. 22. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is of greater and more profitable uſe for the edifying of
the Church. But wherefore, or wherein is it more uſeful? The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
anſwers, and brings it in as a reaſon, to wit, For <hi>he that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecyeth,
ſpeaketh unto men to edification, exhortation, and comfort.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conſequ.</hi> And therefore it follows, That <hi>ſpeaking unto men to
edification, and exhortation, and comfort,</hi> is of all other gifts the
moſt uſeful, and moſt to be deſired and ſought after, and to be
moſt eſteemed, and accounted of by the Church of God: And
ſo are all ſuch who have that gift, and do not hide it in a napkin,
but uſe it accordingly for the ſame end for which it is given,
whiles they keep unto ſound doctrine that cannot be reproved;
and ſpeak but according to the Law and Teſtimony, and ſeek
but onely and chiefly hi glory that ſent them; and that they
might excel to the edifying of the Church, and to convince the
world of ſin, of righteouſneſs, and of judgment: And if they
contend earneſtly, if it be but for the faith that was once deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
to the Saints; or do but ſtand and faſt to the Chriſtian Liberty
where with Chriſt hath made us free, and that they might not
be entangled with yokes of bondage, not be as men pleaſers or
ſervants of men, after they are bought with a price, provided
they preach nor ſeek any liberty at all to do any evil, either in
word or deed; nor to be contentious and diſobedient to the
Truth of God; I ſay of ſuch, they are ſent of God: And who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
reſuſeth, reſiſteth, diſparageth, diſgraceth, or deſpiſeth
ſuch, doth even the ſame to him that ſent them: And ſuch, of
all others, ought to be hon<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>red, even with double honor, that
both rule well, and alſo labor in the word and doctrine by <hi>ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:97084:27"/>
unto men to edification, and exhortation, and comfort,</hi> as hath
been ſaid.</p>
            <p>And therefore all that are in authority ought to give liberty to
all them whoſe ſpirit God hath raiſed to build up the Churches
in their moſt holy Faith, leſt wrath be upon them from
the Lord, as <hi>Ezra</hi> 1. 5, 6. and Chap. 7. 13, 16, 13. and Chap.
8. 22, 23. and <hi>Pſa.</hi> 2.</p>
            <p>It is therefore a matter of dangerous conſequence, either to
act, or ſo much as ſeem to act, or comply with ſuch, who doc
exclude all from any ſpiritual miniſtration, in the name of God,
and of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, yea even in publique, (I mean)
that are not learned in the Tongues; for they exclude, it may be,
ſuch as <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> and all the Church which was at <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,
who were all ſcattered abroad, and went every where preath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the word,</hi> See <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 1, 4. <hi>Pſa.</hi> 2. throughout. And the
<hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeaking to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> tells them, <hi>That when for the
time they ought to have been [Teachers,] yet they had need to
learn, &amp;c. Heb.</hi> 5. 12.</p>
            <p>1 <hi>Reaſ.</hi> For what is it elſe, but to limit the <hi>Holy one of Iſrael,</hi>
that he ſhall not ſpeak, but by the learned onely, either in private
or publique?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Who hath told us plainly,</hi> That he hideth things from the wiſe
and learned, that he revealeth unto babes, Luk. 10.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Reaſ.</hi> And what is it elſe, but clearly to oppoſe the Apoſtles
rules, given out for direction in ſuch caſes, to wit,</p>
            <p>1. As every man hath received the gift, ſo let him adminiſter
the ſame, as good dispoſers of the manifold grace of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And</hi> 2. Let every man adminiſter according to the meaſure or
proportion of his Faith.</p>
            <p>3. And how dangerous is it to adviſe, much leſs to compel any
man to hide his talent in a napkin, and not to ſuffer him to oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupy
with it for his maſters advantage, leaſt it be taken from
him? yea, though it be that [man] that hath but one poor Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
who doubtleſs ought to put it forth in his place and calling,
as well as thoſe that have five or more, ſee <hi>Heb.</hi> 10, 22, to 26, &amp;c.
<hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 12, to 15. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>4. And how ſhall thoſe things be made known to the Church
that are on purpoſe hid from the wiſe and learned, and onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
unto babes, &amp;c. if we cannot be content to learn them
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:97084:28"/>
at babes, as good old <hi>Eli</hi> both did, and was glad to do, at the child
<hi>Samuel?</hi> And hath not God on purpoſe done it; <hi>And choſen
the baſe and fooliſh things of this world, to confound the wiſe and
the mighty, &amp;c.</hi> as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 2, 27, 28. 29. <hi>and Chap.</hi> 2. 11, 12,
13, 14 on purpoſe I ſay.</p>
            <p>Yea, that no fleſh ſhould rejoyce in his preſence, but that he that
glorieth, might glory in the Lord.</p>
            <p>Was not the word of the Lord, revealed unto the Childe <hi>Samu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi>
rather then to good old <hi>Eli:</hi> And did not <hi>Eldad</hi> and <hi>Midad</hi>
propheſie in the Camp, aſ well as the reſt, and as lawfully too; the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of the Lord coming upon them: did <hi>Moſes</hi> forbid them till he
had bleſſed them; or till their callings of God ſhould be eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by miracles; as <hi>Moſes</hi> was, and as ſome do expect; or they
will not heare an unlearned man; ſee <hi>John</hi> 11. 9, 10, 11. <hi>John did
no miracle, though all men held John as a Prophet.</hi> Or ſhall we
charge them with immodeſtie, for offering to preach, without Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination?</p>
            <p>Was no Prophet accounted a Prophet, but that wrought mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
or was ordained by men: and learned in the tongues? Look
<hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 41.</p>
            <p>Was not <hi>Amos</hi> an Herdman, and a gatherer of Sacamore fruit;
when the Lord took him, and ſent him to propheſie? And do not
his words good, to them that walk uprightly, by whomſoever he
ſendeth them?</p>
            <p>Is it not lawful for the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>to thrust forth labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
into his harveſt;</hi> without Licence from the learned in the
tongues?</p>
            <p>Or doe not they that refuſe, whomſoever he ſendeth, refuſe him?
Or is it lawful to forbid any, whom he ſendeth; to preach unto
men, that they might be ſaved? Like the wicked Jewes, the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of ſouls being their chief end, as the drift of their doctrine
will eaſily ſhew.</p>
            <p>Is it not lawfull, for them that know the terror of the Lord, to
perſwade men? And ſhould not every man adminiſter according to
the meaſure of his faith; and be as good Stewards of the manifold
grace of God; as hath been ſaid, without licence, from the learned
in the tongues?</p>
            <p>And muſt they but only be ſuffered, to adminiſter according to
the meaſure, and degrees of their learnedneſs, and knowledge in the
tongues meerely?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:97084:28"/>
Have none the manifeſtation of the ſpirit, but the learned in the
tongues?</p>
            <p>Or dare we croſs the Apoſtle, and ſay, that the Manifeſtation
of the Spirit, is not given to every man, to profit withal?</p>
            <p>Or that the chief grace and gift of the Spirit, and that which is
moſt profitable, and uſefull to the Church for Edification; and
therefore moſt chiefly to be deſired, is <hi>[not]</hi> that men might
propheſie?</p>
            <p>Or what is this propheſying, that is ſo much to be deſired, above
all other gifts; yea, above the gift of tongues? Is it not ſpeaking
unto men to Edification, and Exhortation, and comfort? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
14. 1, 3. Is is not preferred before the gift of tongues? How much
more then is it to be prefer'd before <hi>[Learnedneſs]</hi> in the tongues;
which is onely taught by humane Document; and is not given
as a manifeſtation of the Spirit: but is that which a carnal man,
that knoweth nothing, neither can know any thing, concerning ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
things, may attain unto, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14.</p>
            <p>Therefore learnedneſs in the tongues, being no manifeſtation of
the Spirit at all; is therefore no ſigne, that men are called of God,
and ſent to preach.</p>
            <p>But he that hath propheſie, let him propheſie according to the
proportion of faith.</p>
            <p>But who is this <hi>[He]</hi> that hath propheſie, in the Apoſtles ſence
in this place?</p>
            <p>But he that ſpeaketh unto men; to Edification, and Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and Comfort.</p>
            <p>And yet further by way of Directory, he giveth forth a moſt
exact Rule, to wit:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> But how, and what order muſt be uſed?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Let the Prophets ſpeak, two or three, and let the reſt
judge: And if any thing be revealed to another that ſitteth by, let

               <hi>Queſt.</hi> But where, and when, and in what company muſt this
be, that the Prophets may all ſpeak one by one?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> When the whole Church of the Corinthians was come
together, <hi>as</hi> verſ. 23, 24, 25, 26, 27.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:97084:29"/>
And therefore alſo, when any whole Church, rightly conſtituted; as
the <hi>Corinthians</hi> was, are come together, they may do the like,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> But were not this immodeſty, in theſe dayes, when the
whole Church is come together in ſome place; and every one hath
a Pſalme, hath Doctrine, hath a Tongue, hath Revelation, hath an
Interpretation; That all theſe one by one, ſhould be communicated
for the good of the whole, as <hi>verſ.</hi> 26, 27, 31, 32. all that are Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
I meane, for ſo is the Directory? <hi>verſ.</hi> 29. 24.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Was this the practiſe of the Churches in the Primitive
times, by the Apoſtles direction? Might all that were zealous of
ſpiritual gifts, ſeek that they might excell, <hi>to the Edifying of the
Church?</hi> as verſ. 12.</p>
            <p>And muſt it therefore now, be accounted immodeſty, becauſe it
is not the cuſtome in our Churches, before theſe times?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Yea, muſt it be accounted immodeſty, to uſe the ſame liberty in
thoſe Churches; which are of purpoſe ſo conſtituted; that the
gifts of al that are ſo qualified, may be moſt uſeful and profitable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all: that all might learne, and all might be comforted, and all
might be edified; as</hi> verſ. 30. 31. And might grow in grace, from
faith to faith, and from ſtrength to ſtrength, till they come to
be tall men and women, in Jeſus Chriſt: <hi>as</hi> Pſal. 84. 7. Yea, that
holding the Head, from which all the body by joynts and bands,
having nouriſhment, miniſtred and knit together, might the more
increaſe, with the increaſe of God? <hi>as</hi> Coloſſ. 2. 19. and Chap. 3.
12, 13. to 18.</p>
            <p>And why ſhould any member of the myſtical body of Jeſus
Chriſt, be therefore deſpiſed as uſeleſſe, and unprofitable, becauſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned
in the tongues?</p>
            <p>Hath not God himſelf, on purpoſe, ſo provided and tempered
the body together, and given more honour to that part which lack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
that there might be no Schiſme in the body: but that
the members might learn, to have the ſame care one of another:
<hi>Seeing the heat cannot ſay to the feet, I have no need of
you:</hi> as <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. 13. &amp;c. to the end. Propoſing the uſefulneſſe,
and propriety and neceſſity of every member of our natural bodies;
to be as patterns unto bodies ſpiritual: that all the members, in
their ſeveral places, might be accounted of, incouraged, honoured,
comforted, edified, and eſteemed of, as they ought to be, neceſſary
and uſeful for the good of the whole; ſhewing that the moſt
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:97084:29"/>
feeble members ought not to be deſpiſed, but, as much as in us
lieth, honored and clothed with more abundant comelineſs:
And every one called forth, employed, deſired, and deputed (by
ſuch who can diſcern their proper gifts, or fitneſs and abilities,
for the neceſſary uſe and good of the whole, or of any other parts
or members of the body) to ſuch employments as they are
fitteſt for: And this calling and deputation would take away
all appearance or ſuſpition of immodeſty in any ſuch members,
to what ever employment they are called unto.</p>
            <p>But while it is otherwiſe, and that the very conſtitution of
our <hi>Preſbyterian Churches</hi> require, that none be admitted, but
that is ſo and ſo learned (and that enters in by the learned's door)
It were immodeſty to obſerve the <hi>Apostles rules</hi> in ſuch <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian
Churches.</hi> And it is no marvel if ſuch who do it (yea
though in other Churches) be accounted ſilly fellows, and tub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preachers
by the rude people, who it may be account them, as
they did <hi>paul</hi> and others, no better then mad, as Verſ. 23. For
they are ſo accounted, and ſpoken of too, and that by our grave
Divines, ſo reverendly they eſteem of the gifts of God, and of
the graces of his Spirit, which are the more perſpicuous, by how
much more they are unlearned in the Tongues.</p>
            <p>And therefore it is no marvel if it be ſo unto them all, as is
ſpoken in theſe Scriptures, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29. from the 9, to the end,
<hi>Micab</hi> 3. 5, 6, 7, 8. <hi>Hoſea</hi> 8. 12. Let them look to it that deſpiſe
prophecying, that reſiſt and Spirit; yea, that like <hi>Jannes</hi> and
<hi>Jambres</hi> reſiſt the Truth, and that deſpiſe but the leaſt of thoſe
little ones that beleeve in Chriſt; for they do deſpiſe, and reſiſt
him and his ſacred Truth.</p>
            <p>And it is to be feared, that many are guilty even of ſpeaking
[words] againſt the holy Ghoſt; A dangerous ſin (as it needs
muſt be) <hi>that ſhall never be forgiven either in this life, or in the
life to come,</hi> as <hi>Mat.</hi> 12, 30, 31, 32.</p>
            <p>It is no marvel, if ſuch Miniſters, yea though the chiefeſt of
all on the face of the earth, have no manifeſt Viſion, as once it
was in the days of <hi>Eli,</hi> when they cauſed the people to deſpiſe
the offering of the Lord; even ſo I mean, they cauſe the people
to deſpiſe ſuch ſervice, and offerings, and ſacrifice, as God now
requires, as <hi>Rom,</hi> 12. 1<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 6. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 7, 8, 9, 10. For they
that deſpiſe theſe things, deſpiſe not men, but God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:97084:30"/>
It is no marvel, if they muſt be content either to learn it at
babes, or to be without, and dye without knowledg, as 1 <hi>Sam.</hi>
3. 1, 17, 18. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4 5, 6.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But it will be objected, That the like ways for edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Church in theſe days, that were practiſed in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
times, are not ſuitable now, becauſe that thoſe extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
gifts are ceaſed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. I anſwer, That the chief and moſt profitable of all
thoſe gifts, for edifying of the Church, is ſtill on foot, to wit,
<hi>Prophecying, ſpeaking unto men to edification, and exhortation,
and comfort,</hi> as hath been ſaid, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14, 1, 2, 3.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I anſwer, That the ſame Spirit worketh alſo now,
in them that beleeve, and is as full of power, and as willing alſo
to edifie the Church; for it is not changeable: And what know
we, but ſome now adays are full of matter? <hi>the ſpirit within
them constraining them to ſpeak, Job</hi> 32, 18, to 22. So it was
with <hi>Elihu,</hi> who had not another, but even the ſelf-ſame ſpirit;
who divideth to every man ſeverally as he will: And ſo it was
with <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> and others, as a fire with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
them.</p>
            <p>But it is to be feared, as leaſt, if not a thing obvious and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt,
that there is ſome, even now adays, as in the days of old,
that ſhut the doors of the Kingdom of God, and neither enter
in themſelves, nor ſuffer them that would, as Chriſt himſelf
told them. Yea, Light is wanting, and Viſion faileth them, and
they walk in darkneſs, and yet deſpiſe the help of any new lights,
though many old lights (that are publique and clear, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
unto others, and that of old likewiſe,) would be new
lights unto them, if they could diſcover them, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 10, 11.
But they are in darkneſs, and walk in darkneſs, and know not
whither they go; nor what they ſpeak, nor whereof they affirm,
<hi>But even ſpeak evil of the things they know not,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 12.</p>
            <p>And yet, for all that, would be accounted, and expect to be
followed, and obeyed of all, as if they were omniſcient, like God
himſelf, and could not poſſibly err, Verſ. 10. But all have not
the knowledg of God; this may be ſpoken to all our ſhame:
Elſe they would know, that he that thinketh he knoweth any
thing, knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But there is ordinarily Scriptural examples alledged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:97084:30"/>
this which hath been ſaid, concerning preaching of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned
men that are not learned in the Tongues, nor graduates
in the Schools, to deter men from preſumption in ſuch reſpects,
to wit, the examples of <hi>Vzza,</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah,</hi> and of <hi>Korah</hi> and
his company.</p>
            <p>But they are miſ-applyed for the moſt part, as I ſhall make
it manifeſt from ſacred Scripture.</p>
            <p>1. For firſt, Whereas they are applyed againſt all unlearned
men that take upon them the Prieſts office; they apply them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
againſt <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> as <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 13. &amp; 8, 1, 4.</p>
            <p>2. And ſecondly, It is manifeſt in Scripture, That in ſome
ſence, all the Elect are truly and properly called Prieſts, and both
do, and ought to offer ſacrifice, and to take upon them ſo far
forth, even a Prieſt-like office.</p>
            <p>Reaſ. <hi>For the Apoſtle</hi> Peter, <hi>writing</hi> to the ſtrangers, ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
through Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Aſia, and Bithynia, that
were Elect, &amp;c. 1 Pet. 1. 1, 2. <hi>calleth them</hi> a choſen generation,
a royal Prieſthood, &amp;c. <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. 9. <hi>And</hi> a holy Prieſthood, <hi>verſ.</hi> 5.
<hi>And that alſo</hi> to offer up spiritual ſacrifice, acceptable to God by
Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>And</hi> that they might ſhew forth the praiſes of him
who hath called them out of darkneſs into his marvellous light.
<hi>And</hi> Rev. 1. 6. <hi>It is ſaid of Chriſt, That</hi> he hath made us Kings
and Prieſts unto God and his Father.</p>
            <p>I hope therefore, that none will deny but all the Elect may
offer theſe ſacrifices, to wit, theſe ſpiritual ſacrifices of prayers,
praiſes, and virtuous living, to ſhew forth the virtues, and praiſes
of him that hath called us, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And that alſo, without danger of being ſtruck with leproſie,
or death, or being ſwallowed up of the earth, like <hi>Korah</hi> and
his Company, or being deſtroyed with fire, or any ſuch judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
if they do it in ſincerity, and offer not ſtrange fire, like
<hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu;</hi> And if they charge not others with taking
too much upon them, that are called of God and precious, &amp;c.
like <hi>Korab</hi> and his company.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But it will be objected, But what, is there no differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
then, but all that are elect may take upon them to
preach?</p>
            <p>I anſwer, Yes, There is diverſities of gifts, and diverſities of
operations, &amp;c. And there is degrees and meaſures given out of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:97084:31"/>
the ſame Spirit: It is onely true of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>That to
him was not given the Spirit by meaſure:</hi> And as all members
of the body are not fit for, neither have the ſame office; ſo it is
alſo in the body ſpiritual, That one and the ſelf-ſame Spirit giveth
out to every one ſeverally and variouſly as it pleaſeth him: There
is and ought to be feet and hands, as well as eyes and mouth, which
are moſt properly placed in the head.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And though it be true.</hi> That if any man have not the Spirit of
Christ, the ſame is none of his.</p>
            <p>Yet it therefore follows not, That all that are his have the manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations
of the Spirit.</p>
            <p>It is one thing to have the Spirit, and another thing to have the
manifeſtations of the Spirit.</p>
            <p>But where ever <hi>the manifeſtation of the Spirit is given to any
man, it is given</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>to proſit withal,</hi> in their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
places and degrees, according to the meaſure, or nature, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
of their gifts, and calling; and qualifications: For,</p>
            <p>To one is given by the Spirit, the word of wiſdom; to another
the word of knowledg, by the ſame Spirit: <hi>And</hi> to another faith,
by the ſame Spirit: to another the gifts of healing, by the ſame
Spirit: To another the working of miracles, to another prophecy,
to another diſcerning of ſpirits to another divers kindes of tongues,
to another the interpretation of tongues. <hi>As</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 8, 9, 10, 11,
12, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I ſhall therefore compare ſuch, who (in any of theſe particulars
mentioned by the Apoſtle) have <hi>the manifeſtation of the Spirit,</hi> to
the ſons of <hi>Aaron;</hi> to whom belonged the Prieſthood in a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
manner, above the reſt of the ſons of <hi>Levi:</hi> for ſuch, who have
(in any of theſe particulars) <hi>the manifeſtations of the Spirit,</hi> they
have, as it were, a viſible <hi>unction from the holy One,</hi> 1 <hi>joh.</hi> 2. 20, 27
According as <hi>Aaron</hi> was anointed, and his ſons alſo with him, and
ſprinkled with holy oyl, <hi>Levit.</hi> 8. 30, 31. And ſo were conſecrated,
and appointed to their charge at the Lords appointment, as Verſ.
33, 34, &amp;c. And as <hi>Aaron</hi> was above his ſons, and wore the breſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate,
and other ornaments that were peculiar unto him, as Verſ.
7, 8, 9. and to him onely as the chief Prieſt; ſo the Miniſters of the
Word are chief, and ought to be ſo accounted and eſteemed in the
Church; and all other officers, as Elders and Deacons, who are
reſembleable to the ſons of <hi>Aaron,</hi> (if ſuch as they ought,) ought
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:97084:31"/>
to be choſen and conſecrated likewiſe, as well as the Miniſters: And
they ſhould be known approved, as <hi>men full of the holy Ghoſt,
and wiſdom, and of honeſt report</hi> likewiſe, or elſe they are not ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to be joyned with the Miniſters, nor conſecrated by them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
any office in the Church of God, as appeares, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. 3.</p>
            <p>But all that are ſuch, having the manifeſtation of the Spirit, both
lawfully may, and ought to deſire the <hi>office of Biſhop,</hi> as a worthy
work; or any ſuch office, or liberty in the Church: whereby they
might be uſeful or profitable to the ſame any kind of way. For as
the manifeſtation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all;
ſo, to profit the Church ought likewiſe to be their end, and
the deſire, and endeavour of all that have ſuch gifts: and they may
and ought, even to ſeek occaſions, that they might doe good, and
deſire of God that they might be ſent: as the good Prophet <hi>Iſaia,</hi>
when his lips had been touched with a coal from the Altar, and that
his iniquity was taken away, and his ſin purged: he readily anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the Lord, even before he had his meſſage; <hi>Here am I, ſend me,</hi>
Iſai. 6. 6, 7, 8, 9. And they that are zealous of ſpiritual gifts, ought
to ſeek, that they might excel, to the edifying of the Church. And
ſuch, whoſe end is only the Edifying of the Church, ought not to be
reſtrained, but rather put on and encouraged, and called forth (by
ſuch who can, and do diſcerne their proper gifts and abilities for the
ſame) to ſuch employments and miniſtrations, as they are fitteſt
for; and might be moſt uſeful in: for the good of all, or any part
thereof.</p>
            <p>1. I ſay therefore, we may juſtly compare all ſuch who have
the manifeſtations of the Spirit, to <hi>Aaron,</hi> and his ſons; and they
are all fitted and qualified on purpoſe for ſpiritual miniſtration, or
profit to the Church in one kinde or other, as their gifts and abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
are fitteſt for; and ought to be called and conſecrated thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
and ſuffered to adminiſter, as occaſion ſerves, and as need re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires.</p>
            <p>He that hath propheſie, ought to propheſie according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of Faith; or miniſtry, ſhould wait on his miniſtry; or he
that teacheth, on teaching; or he that exhorteth, on exhortation; he
that giveth, ſhould do it with ſimplicity; he that ruleth, with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence;
and he that ſheweth mercy, with cheerfulneſſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.
6, 7, 8.</p>
            <p>One way or other, ſuch who have the gifts, though differing
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:97084:32"/>
one from another, ought to uſe them, for the edifying, and good,
and benefit of the Church: and ought not to hide their talents in
napkins; but to occupy with them for their maſters profit. And
he whomſoever, that <hi>despiſeth theſe things, deſpiſeth not man but
God, who hath given unto ſome,</hi> that are unlearned in the tongues,
<hi>even his holy Spirit,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4. 8.</p>
            <p>2. And ſecondly, We may juſtly compare all the reſt of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
(that as yet, for the preſent, have no ſuch gifts, or manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Spirit) to all the reſt of the Tribe of <hi>Levie,</hi> Who
thought they did not beare the iniquity of the Sanctuary, and the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
of their Prieſthood, nor miniſter before the Tabernacle of
witneſs, nor might not come nigh the veſſels of the Sanctuary, and
the Altar, leſt they ſhould die:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Yet</hi> Aaron was appointed to bring them with him, that they
might be joyned unto him, and miniſter unto him; And keep his
charge, and the charge of all the Tabernacle of the Congregation,
for all the ſervice of the Tabernacle. Whereas a ſtranger might
not come neer unto them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But</hi> Aaron and his Sons muſt keep the charge of the Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
and the charge of the Altar, that there might be no wrath
any more upon the children of Iſrael: As there had formerly
been occaſioned by the rebellion of Corah, and in part of all the
Congregation, <hi>Numb.</hi> 18. 2, 3, 4, 5, and Chap. 16. 45.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For as the Lord told</hi> Aaron, <hi>that</hi> behold he had taken their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
the Levites, from among the children of Iſrael; to them
they were given as a gift for the Lord, to doe the ſervice of the
Congregation. But he, and his Sons with him, ſhould keep the
Prieſts office, for every thing of the Altar, and within the vaile;
and that they ſhould ſerve; for he had given their Prieſts office
unto them, as a ſervice, or gift; And the ſtranger that came nigh
ſhould be put to death: <hi>as</hi> Chap. 18. 6, 7.</p>
            <p>Even ſo we may juſtly ſay, behold, the Lord hath taken all true
beleevers, from amongſt their neighbours, and give them as a gift
of the Lord, to be joyned with the Miniſters, and other Officers in
the Church of God, to do the ſervices of the Congregation, and to
keep all the charge of the Church, in all outward reſpects, as for
receiving in or ſhutting out from the publike aſſembly, joyntly
with them.</p>
            <p>But the Miniſters, and Officers are to keep the charge of all with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:97084:32"/>
the vaile; as of the Word, and Sacraments, which they are to
adminiſter, in the name of God, and of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and
to take care, that none be admitted, but ſuch who are outwardly,
or at leaſt, profeſſedly clean; having their hearts purified through
faith, and repentance, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Though yet, this always provided, that as the Levites,</hi> Levit. 8.
14, 15, 16, 18, 19. <hi>Thought they all</hi> were given as a gift unto Aaron,
and his Sons, to do the ſervice of the Tabernacle of the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
(Yet) they were not admitted, to adminiſter and wait on
the ſervice of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, but from
25 years old, and upwards; and from the age of 50 years they ſhould
ceaſe waiting on the ſervice thereof, and ſhould ſerve no more, but
ſhould miniſter with their brethren in the Tabernacle of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,
to keep the charge, <hi>as</hi> Numb. 8. 24, 25, 26.</p>
            <p>Even ſo alſo, Though all beleevers are given as a gift to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,
and Officers of the Church, to be joyned with them, in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening,
and ſhutting; in binding and looſing; in all ſuch reſpects
as concern the whole Church, for the good of all, as when all
muſt receive, or all reject; all approve, or diſ-allow; all elect, or
eject, &amp;c. becauſe that all are acceſſary, or joyntly ingaged in ſuch
generall buſineſs, as <hi>members of the body,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 16, 17.</p>
            <p>Yet they are not admittable, in this reſpect, neither, till they
come to ripeneſs, and maturity of judgement in Chriſtianity; and
be eſtabliſhed in the faith, and in the trade and practiſe of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity,
in all duties belonging thereunto: for there is a childhood
and minority, as well in grace, as nature, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 1, 2.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And therefore ſaith the Apoſtle,</hi> Receive the weak, but not
unto doubtful [diſputations:] Rom. 14.</p>
            <p>Even ſo ſay I, the weake ought to be received, but not to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle
in doubtful <hi>[Elections;]</hi> or Ejections, &amp;c. in which
they have no skill, nor judgement, and experience in.</p>
            <p>For ſo the wiſdom of God accounted fit, to appoint the <hi>Levites,</hi>
in ſuch like ſervice, and reſpects, that belonged to their charge:
Leſt by any means, their ſervice and office ſhould be deſpiſed,
through male-adminiſtration, or childiſh ignorance or defection,
and therefore they muſt not adminiſter, till they came to the age of
25. <hi>Years, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore to conclude, an abrevate, from all theſe compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons;
It is thus much in effect.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:97084:33"/>
Abrev. <hi>To wit, All the</hi> Elect, <hi>that are built upon Chriſt by a
lively Faith,</hi> are lively ſtones, built up a ſpiritual houſe, <hi>yea,</hi> an
holy Prieſthood, to offer up ſpiritual ſacrifice, acceptable to God
by Jeſus Chriſt, 1 Pet. 2. 5. and Chap. 1. 2.</p>
            <p>So that all Beleevers are accounted as Prieſts, even from their
firſt ingrafting into Chriſt by faith, (in ſome reſpects) as is before
ſpecified.</p>
            <p>But as there was Prieſts of divers orders; ſo alſo ought the true
Beleevers to be diſtinguiſhed.</p>
            <p>I compare therefore the newly converted to the <hi>Levites</hi> in their
minority, till they came to years: and all the grown Chriſtians,
that are approved and experienced in the trade and practiſe of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity,
to the <hi>Levites</hi> when they came to years of diſcretion.</p>
            <p>And all the Elders and Officers elected by the Church, or that
are full of the holy Ghoſt and of wiſdom, I compare to the Prieſts,
the ſons of <hi>Aaron,</hi> yea, though they be of ſuch as are not learned
in Tongues, if they have ſuch gifts, and qualifications, as are mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtations
of the Spirit of God.</p>
            <p>And ſo the Miniſters of God, I compare to <hi>Aaron,</hi> who in
many things was above his ſons, as hath been ſaid.</p>
            <p>And who knoweth, but the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>upon whoſe
ſhoulder the Government lieth,</hi> will govern his Church after theſe
examples, ſeeing the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> doth thus compare them, as
reſembling the <hi>Prieſthood,</hi> and not as reſembling the <hi>Jewiſh Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
both <hi>Priests and People?</hi> for that he doth not, ſee alſo,
<hi>Mal.</hi> 4. 4. And then the danger lieth not againſt men unlearned,
that have <hi>the manifeſtation of the Spirit, and of power,</hi> leaſt <hi>they
ſhould periſh in the gainſaying of Korah, becauſe they take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them,</hi> being called by the Church, to preach and adminiſter in
the name of God. But the danger lies againſt ſuch who are <hi>ſenſual,
having not the ſpirit,</hi> and yet will take upon them miniſterial fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
in the name of God, becauſe they are learned in the Tongues,
and Graduates in the Schools, <hi>Jude</hi> 11, 18, 19, 20. See <hi>Zech.</hi> 12,
13. Chap. Theſe are <hi>ſtrangers that may not come nigh, &amp;c.</hi> as
<hi>Numb.</hi> 18. 4, 22.</p>
            <p>But it will be objected, That if unlearned men be ſuffered to
preach, <hi>they that are unlearned, and unſtable,</hi> may <hi>wreſt the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
to their own deſtruction,</hi> as 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 16, 17. and may lead o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
into errors and ſchiſms, and cannot be hindered, nor ſuppreſt;
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:97084:33"/>
neither can it otherwiſe be avoyded; but men that know not the
originall, ſhould ordinarily miſ-underſtand dark places of Scripture,
and ſo like <hi>blinde guides lead men into the ditch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer that it is true, That men that are both <hi>unle arn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and unſtable,</hi> do, and will <hi>wreſt</hi> ſome places of Scripture; and
it cannot be avoyded, but there will be <hi>falſe Teachers, even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
us in theſe days, as well as there was falſe Prophets in the
days of old,</hi> as 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 1. And ſuch alſo, it may be <hi>as ſhall privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bring in damnable Hereſies, even denying the Lord that bought
them, and ſhall bring upon themſelves ſwift deſtruction:</hi> And
there is no ſecurity given out in Scripture, That none that is learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Tongues ſhould be of the number of theſe <hi>falſe teachers:</hi>
for men that are learned in the Tongues, may be <hi>unſtable, and wreſt
the Scriptures:</hi> and by how much the more they, that are <hi>unſtable,</hi>
are learned in the Tongues, they are even ſo much the more danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
if they ſhould be ſuffered.</p>
            <p>And therefore <hi>unſtableneſs</hi> is a greater fault, and more dangerous
then <hi>unlearnedneſs</hi> in the Tongues: And men may he learned in
the Scriptures, or unlearned either, and yet learned in the Tongues.</p>
            <p>Men ought not therefore to be inhibited to preach, (leſt they
ſhould be unſtable, and wreſt the Scriptures) for then the learned,
as well as the unlearned, ſhould both be inhibited.</p>
            <p>But ſuch, who (being <hi>proved) are found unſtable,</hi> and that
<hi>they do wreſt the Scriptures,</hi> no man will deny, but ſuch may,
and ought to be inhibited, when they are found out, and convict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of error, or of ſchiſm, &amp;c. yea, though they be of the learned.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But to inhibit men before, were to</hi> cenſure and condemn men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they be heard. <hi>And ſee</hi> Ezek, 18. 20. The righteouſneſs of
the righteous ought to be upon him, <hi>as a badg of honor;</hi> but the
wickedneſs of the wicked ſhould <hi>but</hi> be upon himſelf.</p>
            <p>But the beſt and ſureſt way to prevent the ſowing and ſpreading
of Errors, or Schiſms, is to give liberty, that any whomſoever,
that preacheth in publique, may in publique alſo be reprehended
(be they learned or unlearned) if they preach erroneouſly in any
Congregation; that ſo the ſame Auditory, that hears them preach
any Error, or Schiſm, or falſe Doctrine, may, by juſt reprehenſion
from clear Scripture-evidence, be ſatisfied to the contrary; and
have ſuch evil ſeed purged out quickly, before it grow up, or be
ſpread any further; for ſo it ought to be: And thoſe Churches are
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:97084:34"/>
not rightly conſtituted, where this liberty is either wanting, or not
in uſe, when the Truth of God is wronged, and wreſted, and
<hi>turned into a lye;</hi> and when his ſacred Word is <hi>handled deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,</hi>
and miſ-applyed, as it often is, even by the learned in the
Tongues, that are <hi>unſtable</hi> &amp;c. And yet no man allowed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
them for it, nor convince them of it, at leaſt not in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique:
And how then ſhall the ſame Auditory be purged from it, if
their reprehenſion be not as publique, as the doctrine is preached?
For who knows that all the Congregation ſhall every one of them
be aſſembled again? and the doctrine may be ſuch, as may lead them
to <hi>perdition and deſtruction,</hi> both of their ſouls and bodies.</p>
            <p>And this liberty being in uſe, will doubtleſs make both the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and unlearned a great deal more careful, <hi>to keep unto ſound
doctrine that cannot be reproved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And they that plead ſo much againſt liberty of preaching of men
unlearned in the Tongues, for fear of the ſpreading of errors and
ſchiſms, and yet will not allow this publique liberty of reprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
(as hath been ſaid) to prevent, and avoyd, and purge the ſame.
I can hardly beleeve that the ſpreading of Errors and Schiſms is the
chief cauſe that makes them zealous therein, but ſome other by, or
ſelf-reſpects, which they will not own.</p>
            <p>For no man, that is zealous againſt ſuch ſpreading gangrenes, but
he will allow, and juſtifie, and approve all poſſibe means to avoyd
or ſtay them, elſe he is not cordial in that reſpect: And what
means poſſibly can be more awful, and more ſuitable, and even
neceſſary, then publique reprehenſion of publique Errors? The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
<hi>Paul</hi> reprehended <hi>Peter before them all,</hi> Gal. 2. 14.</p>
            <p>And them that ſin <hi>(ſaith the Apoſtle)</hi> rebuke before all, that
others alſo may fear, 1 Tim. 5. 20.</p>
            <p>But it will be objected, That it were an immodeſt part for any
man to implead his Miniſter in the publique Congregation; and
might diſgrace, and diſparage, and diſhonor him for ever.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> I anſwer, That it is far greater immodeſty in ſuch Miniſters
to need to it, and to give juſt occaſion by dealing immodeſtly with
the Truth of God, to the diſgrace, and diſparagement, and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
of God; in reſpect of whom, and for maintenance of whoſe
Truth, we muſt not know either father or mother, ſon or daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
Miniſter or Maſter, brother or friend; but to undervalue, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace,
diſhonor, diſparage, yea, and even hate them, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:97084:34"/>
thereof; and rather then baulk the Truth, that concerns the
good of immortal ſouls, eſpecially in caſe, when it may endanger
the loſs of ſouls, <hi>ſo precious is the Redemption of ſouls, and their
continuance for ever:</hi> and of ſo high eſteem ought the glory of
God to be valued of us.</p>
            <p>He that valueth <hi>himſelf,</hi> or his own honor, or grace and glory,
yea, or <hi>his own life,</hi> better then the <hi>Truth and the Glory of God,</hi>
deſerveth no better, but ſhame and diſhonor for his ſelf-iſh ends
and pride, &amp;c. And <hi>he that doth truth, and cometh to the light,
that his deeds may be made manifeſt that they are wrought in God,</hi>
He will be deſirous to be tryed by the touchſtone, even the Truth it
ſelf; and will love him better that lets him ſee his error (in ſuch a
caſe) then him <hi>that flattereth with his lips,</hi> or holdeth his tongue,
and lets him run on in erroneous paths, either in life or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
            <p>And it is a ſign, that ſuch men <hi>do [evil] that hate the light,</hi>
and that will not abide the tryal by the touchſtone, in as open and
publique a place, as they have held forth doctrine, provided always
that it be done with <hi>meekneſs,</hi> in a loving way, as it ought to be;
for ſo ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Let all your things be done in love.</hi> And
that there be alſo a free acknowledgment, by them that do it, of
their own weakneſſes, and ſubjection of themſelves to all or any
Error, and <hi>to be likewiſe tempted and drawn aſide;</hi> and that they
onely ſtand, and are upheld by the <hi>Grace of God,</hi> of his free accord;
and with a clear manifeſtation of ſuch material and weighty cauſes,
and conſiderations, moving them thereunto, as are of greater value
and conſequence, then the credit, and reputation, and honor due un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
ſuch a Miniſter; for it ought not to be done upon ſlight occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but matters of weight, and ſuch as will over-ballance all the
ſhame and diſgrace that may poſſibly fall upon ſuch a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter.</p>
            <p>And it is a ſigne, that <hi>men come of themſelves,</hi> (and are not
ſent of God) <hi>if they ſeek their own glory:</hi> or if their own
glory be ſo near and dear unto them, that they cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to undervalue it, to the glory of God, or to his ſacred truth;
if they cannot be content to let <hi>God be [true] and every man a
lyar;</hi> but will rather oppoſe the truth of God, then acknowledg
themſelves to <hi>have erred from the truth,</hi> Jam. 5. 19, 20. It is a
ſhrewd ſign, that there is in ſuch men, a ſpice of that pride, that
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:97084:35"/>
exalteth the <hi>Pope, above all that is called God, or that is worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped:</hi>
Who arrogateth power, and dominion to himſelf, as if he
could not erre; for all men muſt beleeve, what he aſſerteth; and
punctually obey his commands, and decrees, though never ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true,
or unjuſt &amp;c. Yea, though quite contrary to the word of
God, and to the light of reaſon: Or elſe they muſt be Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,
out of their Churches: oh horrible pride! and yet a ſpice
thereof, is doubtleſſe to be found in all men by nature: And in the
natures of many, that yet notwithſtanding have the grace of God;
for they are partly <hi>fleſh,</hi> and partly <hi>Spirit;</hi> and it is rare to finde
out ſuch a man, as can <hi>deny himſelf, and take up his croſſe, and
follow Christ</hi> [fully:] That can <hi>endure the croſs, and deſpiſe the
ſhame;</hi> for men can very hardly endure to be <hi>[croſt;]</hi> yea,
though they croſs and oppoſe, even the truth of God; how much
leſſe then, would they <hi>endure the croſs, and the ſhame, and ſpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting?</hi>
And they cannot endure to be deſpiſed, and diſhonoured,
when they doe deſpiſe, and diſhonour God. How much leſs then,
can they <hi>deſpiſe the ſhame,</hi> in reſpect of the honour and glory of
God?</p>
            <p>But it will be objected, that if this were ſuffered, any man (that
would) might implead the Miniſter, if he think he erre, even when
he hath preached the truth of God. And ſo many raiſe contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies
of diſputation, when ever they pleaſe, to diſturbe and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
the Congregations; amongſt which, there are ſome that are
<hi>weake,</hi> that ought to be <hi>received, but not unto controverſies of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, as before, that it ought not to be done, but in matters
of weight, that may be clearly evinced from the Word of God.</p>
            <p>And if any oppoſe, or contradict the truth, either through ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,
or ignorance; It may miniſter occaſion to ſuch a Miniſter,
to <hi>convince gain-ſayers;</hi> and then the ſhame, and diſhonour, will light on them, and the truth of God be the more ſplendorous, in
that reſpect; and if it be done of malice, his malice that doth it will
be diſcovered; and if it be through ignorance, he may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced,
and better informed; and will have cauſe of thankfulneſs,
both to God, and the Miniſter, that <hi>hath converted him,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
his doubts.</p>
            <p>But if it were the cuſtom, that Judicious men might not (one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in caſe of erronious Doctrine, but of things dark and myſterious,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:97084:35"/>
that are not fully cleared in their miniſtration) put them on by
way of queſtion; or deſire them to illuſtrate, or clear ſuch a point;
or inlarge themſelves in profitable points, and confirm them better;
It might be very profitable to the Church of God: For the people
will more regard and conſider better, of ſuch particular points, as
have been the ſubject of ſuch diſcourſe, and are, as it were, vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and concluded upon (and ſo confirmed againſt all objections,
or obſcurities whatſoever, even in the publike Congregation, and
by the moſt Judicious in reputation amongſt them) then of other
particulars.</p>
            <p>And this alſo would be a meanes, to debar all ſuch from uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
the Miniſtry, that are not able for it: and <hi>to convince gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayers,
and ſtop their mouths;</hi> and to maintain alſo, and vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
the truth.</p>
            <p>Yea, it would be a means to ſeclude all ſuch, as are not men of ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denying
ſpirits, ſuch as the Lord Jeſus requires; that ſuch ſhould
be (if they would attaine to be his Diſciples) eſpecially, his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters.</p>
            <p>4. The <hi>Independent</hi> principles are likewiſe ſtricter, in <hi>ſtanding
faſt to ſuch Chriſtian Liberties</hi> (in other reſpects) <hi>wherewith
Jeſus Chriſt hath made us free;</hi> Then the ways and principles, or
at leaſt, the practiſes of <hi>Preſbyterians</hi> will ſuffer.</p>
            <p>1. As firſt, concerning their <hi>Independency,</hi> in reſpect of other
Churches <hi>whiles they do well,</hi> as <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 3, 4. <hi>&amp;</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. <hi>to</hi>
23. <hi>&amp; Chap.</hi> 4. 1, 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 12, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For as it is granted by <hi>[All:]</hi>
That in caſe of <hi>neceſſitie,</hi> as when a Church liveth where it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
govern in a <hi>Preſbyterial</hi> way, in a <hi>Claſſical,</hi> and <hi>Synodical</hi>
manner; becauſe there is no Churches to combine with, within
convenient bonds: or at leaſt, none that are willing. They allow
them power within themſelves, both for conſtitution, and diſſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of ſuch a Church, as they ſee occaſion, for the benefit of the
ſame; and the glory of God, and their ſouls health.</p>
            <p>And therefore ſeeing <hi>all power</hi> both for Government, and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
is neceſſarily allowed them in ſuch a caſe. Though they are
not againſt the conſociation of true Chriſtian Churches, for the
mutuall advice, and Edification, and help, and comfort of one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other;
or in caſe of admonition, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Yet they utterly deny, to ſubmit themſelves, as under the Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictive
authority of any ſuch Churches, ſave only in caſe of advice
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:97084:36"/>
or councel, or admonition; or at moſt, as ſiſter Churches in every
reſpect, and as they ſhall convince them from Scripture grounds;
that their decrees, or reſults, are according to God, and to his
Laws and Teſtimonies, concerning them, either in Doctrine, or
Government.</p>
            <p>And therefore will not ſubmit, to binde themſelves to be orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
or governed, by the votes of ſuch, in any reſpect, till they firſt
know, what their votes are that they ſubmit unto; leſt they
ſhould be enſlaved to the wills of men, againſt their conſciences;
which are, or ought to be onely bound by Scriptural decrees, or
looſed either: And therefore ought not to be ſubmitted to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
of men, not infallibly guided, though never ſo numerous, or
<hi>wiſe and learned;</hi> who all may erre, and often do: and therefore
ought not to challenge any binding authority, or power whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
or looſing either, but onely in caſe, and ſo far forth as they
can and doe, even convince the Conſcience, from Scripture evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
<hi>In the name of God, and of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> that
their decrees are juſt, and ought to be obeyed, and ſubmitted to:
And it is lawfull as well for a Church, as a particular man, to goe <hi>to
the Law and to the Teſtimony,</hi> as they are injoyn'd.</p>
            <p>And <hi>to ſearch the Scriptures dayly, whether thoſe things be ſo,</hi>
that are decreed, or taught us; or that are preached unto us, yea,
though <hi>by an Angel from heaven:</hi> And if we finde they teach us
<hi>another Goſpel then what we have received,</hi> we muſt <hi>let them be
accurſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it is evident, that <hi>the Apoſtles, and Elders, and the whole
Church being aſſembled with one accord;</hi> reſolved of nothing, till
it was cleared from Scripture; that all aſſented, and agreed to it,
even the <hi>whole Church,</hi> as <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 22, 25.</p>
            <p>And it is certaine, that either a particular man, or particualar
Church, having Scriptural grounds, may ſay as [they,] <hi>It ſeemed
good to the holy Ghost, &amp;c.</hi> For what the Scripture decrees, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghoſt decrees.</p>
            <p>And therefore all Aſſemblies, Congregational, Presbyterial, Claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical,
Synodical, National, or Oecumenical, ſhould onely be as this
in the <hi>Acts, to conſider of ſuch matters,</hi> as <hi>verſ.</hi> 6. And to reſolve
them from Scripture; that all being aſſured from Scripture ground,
may <hi>with one accord,</hi> paſſe ſentence with them, being fully aſſured,
that <hi>it ſeemeth good to the holy Ghoſt,</hi> as well as <hi>unto them,</hi> what
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:97084:36"/>
ever is reſolved, or decreed, or done in his ſacred name. Elſe they
are preſumptuous and ſelf-willed, and do uſurp authority over the
Church of God; if they take upon them to binde and looſe, and do
not <hi>make it manifeſt, as they ought to do,</hi> from Scripture evidence;
that <hi>it ſeemeth good to the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> as well as them, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 4. 4.
And though it is true, that we ought <hi>to obey them that have the
overſight of us,</hi> and that <hi>have the Rule over us,</hi> and <hi>to follow
their faith,</hi> as <hi>Hebr.</hi> 13. 7, 17. Yet it muſt be in caſe, when we
know them to be ſuch, as <hi>watch for our ſouls, as they that muſt
give account; that they may do it with joy, and not with grief.</hi>
And it muſt be upon conſideration of the <hi>end of their converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
that it is Jeſus Christ yeſterday, and to day, and the ſame
for ever.</hi> For they that preach unto us the Word of God, ſhould
not be changeable; leaſt <hi>they carry us about with divers and
ſtrange doctrines,</hi> as <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. 9. which we muſt not be, to follow
their faith; nor in obedience unto them, <hi>That turne away their
ears from the truth, and are turned unto fables,</hi> as 2 <hi>Tim</hi> 4. 3,
4. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 3. 4. 5. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2 <hi>Tim</hi> 3. 2 3, 4. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3. 6. 7, 8. And <hi>if
any come unto us, and bring not the true Doctrine, we muſt not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
him to houſe, neither bid him God ſpeed,</hi> as 2 <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.</p>
            <p>How much leſſe, may ſuch be received as Miniſters of God; and
maintan'd either by tythes, or other maintenance. And how unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
is it (therefore) either for Magiſtrates, or others, to force mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
of any ſuch; or to limit men by Parochiall bounds; that
in caſe a Pariſh, ſhall <hi>heap to themſelves teachers after their owne
hearts, having itching ears, that turn from the truth:</hi> Yet men
muſt be inforced, to maintain ſuch teachers, and to heare them
likewiſe; and muſt not <hi>withdraw themſelves,</hi> as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
injoynes us; nor go elſewhere, unleſs we can remove our ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations
alſo; which cannot chuſe but be ſometimes inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent;
and to our utter overthrow in wordly reſpects.</p>
            <p>All which bondage, is a great infringement to <hi>our Chriſtian Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,</hi>
in them that do it, and ought not to be approved nor aſſented
to, by any that deſires to <hi>keep a good conſcience voyd of offence,
both to God and man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> For how many thouſand Pariſhes, both have been, and
are, not onely here, but in other Kingdoms, by this means, kept
utterly deſtitute of any ſpiritual food, for the good of their ſouls:
And that ſometimes, even for a whole age together, during the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:97084:37"/>
Parſons or Vicars life, Who once enſtall'd, can never be removed,
If he be conformable, to the Government on foot, and can pleaſe
the greater, or moſt of the Pariſh; yea, and though he be never ſo
<hi>carnal;</hi> If he have but learning, and an outward form of doctrine
and profeſſion, in reſpect of Religion, like the generality of the
Congregation: though he utterly <hi>deny the power of godlineſſe;</hi>
yet all his Pariſhoners, (though never ſo godly and conſcientious)
muſt hold them contented, during ſuch a mans life, for they muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
him his Tythes, or maintenance; and they muſt not obey the
Apoſtles direction, to wit, from <hi>ſuch turn away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But they muſt keep to their own Church, and be bound to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to their own Miniſter, unleſs they can remove out of ſuch a
Pariſh. And ſo in all likelihood, famiſh the ſouls of their whole fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies;
If God be not mercifull, in ſtretching forth his immediate
hand in an extraordinary unexpected way: [For the ordinary
Way] Is <hi>by the fooliſhneſs of Preaching,</hi> (as ſo the World ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>) <hi>to ſave them that beleeve.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore let men ſay what they will, but there is no other
way, to keep ſuch men out, for intruding themſelves, and being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded
upon them; but to let all that are godly, and conſcienci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
have free liberty, to approve, and receive, or admic, and in ſtall,
whom they generally allow off; or to diſ-approve, reject,
turn from, diſ-inſtall, or eject, whom they diſſavow. For how
elſe can they, in ſuch reſpects, obey the Apoſtles direction; <hi>and
keep a good conſcience, void of offence both towards God and
man, Heb.</hi> 13. 8, 9. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 4, 5. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 3, 4. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3. 6, 7,
8. 2 <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. <hi>&amp; Joh.</hi> 10. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, <hi>to</hi> 16.</p>
            <p>Let any man tell me but <hi>[how]</hi> and I ſhall ſilence for ever in
that reſpect. How, I mean, they ſhall anſwer theſe Scriptures as they
ought to do.</p>
            <p>If it be promiſed that the <hi>Preſbyterial</hi> Govenment will ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide,
that none ſhall be admitted, and approved off, but ſuch as are
truly ſpiritual, and of the moſt able, and fit for the Miniſtry, that
can be found; and then it need not to trouble the conſcience of any
man in that reſpect.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, that I cannot beleeve it, till I ſee it done, or by what
means it ſhould be effected; Whiles <hi>[all]</hi> have vote, and power
in Election, and may, either chuſe whom they think good, or be
without, All (I meane) that have taken the Covenant, many of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:97084:37"/>
whom, have ſo little underſtanding in <hi>Spiritual things,</hi> that they
are not thought worthy to receive the Sacrament. And how then
can ſuch diſcern, whether men be ſpiritural and able for the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty;
or they be but carnal, and ſuch <hi>as can know nothing of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
things,</hi> to wit, <hi>of the things of God.</hi> As a <hi>Corinthians,</hi>
2. 14.</p>
            <p>The natural man perceiveth not the things of God, neither can
he know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcern'd; <hi>to wit,</hi>
through an eye of faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But the ſpiritual man,</hi> to wit, a man throughly ſpiritualized,
through faith in God; <hi>diſcerneth all things, yea, even the deep
things of God</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> It will be objected, that all that are godly, and truely
conſcientious, are not able to diſcern of the fitneſs of men, for
ſpirituall imployment. And therefore it is more wiſdom, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the apporveal of all ſpiritual men, to the <hi>Wiſe and Learned,</hi>
and to the Elderſhips, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Anſw. <hi>I anſwer, that</hi> He that entreth in by the door, <hi>(which
is Chriſt himſelf, our Archbiſhop,</hi> is the ſhepherd of the ſheep;) <hi>as</hi> Joh. 10. 2. 9.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And</hi> to him the Porter openeth, and the ſheep hear his voice, and
he calleth his own ſheep by name, and leadeth them out: And
when he putteth forth his own ſheep, he goeth before them; and
the ſheep follow him, for they know his voice.</p>
            <p>And a ſtranger will they not follow, but will fly from him;
for they know not the voice of ſtrangers, <hi>as</hi> verſ. 3. 4, 5.</p>
            <p>This is the promiſe, and the plain aſſertion of Chriſt himſelf;
That <hi>his ſheep know his voice,</hi> by whomſoever he ſendeth it; for
the <hi>Porter,</hi> to wit his (holy Spirit) <hi>openeth their hearts,</hi> as he did
the <hi>heart of Lydia,</hi> even to hear, and obey, and to follow, and
doe; to imbrace, and to receive, yea, to love, and honour; even
ſuch, who bring them ſuch <hi>glad tydings, of life, and peace, and of
truth, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore, though they be not able to diſcern, and diſcover,
and judge who is fitteſt, and the moſt able; for ſuch, and ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment;
yet they can diſcern, who are ſent of God, and bring
his meſſage; ſo far, at leaſt, as not to <hi>follow a ſtranger: for
the voyce of ſtrangers, is ſtrange unto them;</hi> and ſuch as <hi>they
will not follow:</hi> ſo that the general approbation, of <hi>the ſheep of
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:97084:38"/>
Chriſt;</hi> ſuch eſpecially, who are known to be his, is the note of a ſhepherd that is called of God, and ſent to preach; or that is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to officiate in any place about ſpiritual things.</p>
            <p>And though they cannot diſcern who is fit for office; yet if the
wiſe, and learned, ſhould appoint them a <hi>ſtranger,</hi> or an <hi>hireling,</hi>
and that careth not for them; or ſuch whoſe voice they know not,
or to whom the <hi>Porter openeth not:</hi> They ought not to <hi>follow,</hi> but
to <hi>fly from them,</hi> as from <hi>thieves and robbers:</hi> yea, as <hi>ſheep</hi>
from <hi>wolves,</hi> that would <hi>murder, and deſtroy, and devoure</hi> their
ſouls: as <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. 8. 10. 12, 13.</p>
            <p>But if this be their duty, as doubtleſs it is; if they once diſcern
who are ſuch or ſuch: Then it neceſſarly follows, that they ought
not by authority to be otherwiſe impelled; but that in ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects,
(as do ſo highly concern the good of their ſouls, and the
ſouls of their houſholds, and their poſterities after them, till the
world determine,) They might have liberty of conſcience, as they
dare anſwer it, at the great tribunal; to deale impartially in all
ſuch caſes, of ſuch concernment, to <hi>approve,</hi> or <hi>reject,</hi> as they
think they ought. And as conſidering themſelves, even now already
in whatever they doe; to <hi>be before God, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,
and the elect Angels:</hi> as 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 21.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And this is a</hi> Liberty, wherewith Jeſus Chriſt hath made us free;
<hi>to which it is our duty to</hi> ſtand faſt. <hi>And to</hi> beware of ſuch as
ſhall come unto us, in ſheeps cloathing, that yet inwardly are rave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
wolves. <hi>And he hath promiſed, that</hi> we ſhall know them by
their fruits, <hi>Mat</hi> 12. 30, to 35.</p>
            <p>And they that would <hi>ſpoil us of any ſuch liberties,</hi> are in that
reſpect, to be accounted no better then <hi>Theeves and Robbers:</hi> yea,
ſpirituall theeves, that would ſpoile our ſoules. And ſuch therefore
we ought not to receive, nor to bid them <hi>God ſpeed,</hi> where they
teach ſuch Doctrine; unleſs in hope that they do it ignorantly:
and that we onely receive them, in hope to reduce them, from ſuch
dangerous error.</p>
            <p>If it be objected, that men will not allow any maintenance to
ſuch whom they may not have vote in Election of; unleſs it be
compelled or forced from them, which is not warrantable, as hath
been ſaid, and proved by ſome.</p>
            <p>I anſwer briefly, that whatever others that are malignant, and
enemies to the <hi>Church of God,</hi> will do or refuſe, give or with-hold
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:97084:38"/>
in ſuch a caſe, that doth not exempt thoſewho are godly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious
form doing their duties, and from being <hi>impartial</hi> in
ſuch weighty buſineſs that concerns the good of their immortal
ſouls; in which caſes <hi>all things ſhould be done without partiality
or respect of perſons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And they ought rather ſo to joyn themſelves, as to maintain a
Miniſtry upon their own charges, then to give their ſufferage or
vote for ſuch to be inſtalled in a place, as ought not to preach.</p>
            <p>And if it were ſo, that the truly religious would joyn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and engage in Covenant each to others, for this end, that
all of them might <hi>ſpeak</hi> even <hi>the ſame thing,</hi> without <hi>partiality
or respect of perſons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There would ſcarce any accept of a place, but that were ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
called or approved by them; nor would they continue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
their wills, nor act contrary to their general reſults from
Scripture grounds.</p>
            <p>But whiles they ſit looſe, and are partially engaged, and do
not <hi>aſſemble themſelves</hi> (even <hi>their own ſelves)</hi> for theſe and
ſuch like buſineſs that concerns them all; how is it poſſible that
they ſhould know the mindes each of others, or the grounds or
reaſons upon which they act? or how to reſolve fully, ſo as all
may aſſent, and be ſatiſfied in conſcience from ſacred Scripture,
that ſo they ought to reſolve in ſuch and ſuch caſes.</p>
            <p>And therefore they ought thus to joyn and aſſemble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and be engaged deeply each unto others, that things of
this nature might be juſtly carried, without partiality or reſpect
of perſons, yea, at leaſt in private, if authority will not ſuffer
them to engage in publique; if there be ſo many within conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
bounds, as may in any poſſibility do good this way.</p>
            <p>5. They are ſtricter in maintaining the <hi>Power, and Kingdom,
and ſupremacy of Chriſt,</hi> then the <hi>Preſbyterian Government</hi> (as
in now ſtands) will allow or ſuffer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> For though they do allow, that the body of the Church
ſhould be obedient and ſubject to the Miniſters and Elders of
the ſame, ſo far forth as they hold forth the Word and Voyce of
Chriſt, as <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 4. and do make it manifeſt (as they ought to
do) from the <hi>Law and Teſtimony,</hi> that their ways and words,
or judgments, and cenſures, or proceedings, are right, as in the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:97084:39"/>
way of the Churches of <hi>New England,</hi> appers <hi>pag.</hi> 100.
<hi>Chap.</hi> 5.</p>
            <p>Yet in caſe, when the Officers of a Church ſhall err, and
commit an offence, or miſcarry the buſineſs that concerns them
all, or that in any reſpect concerns <hi>the glory of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They make bold to over rule them, and to maintain the truth,
and reſcue the innocent, or condemn the guilty, and to elect, or
eject, receive, or refuſe; yea, to remit or retain, as they finde
cauſe and ground form Scripture; yea, though quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory
to the judgments, and decrees, and reſults of their El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;
and in caſe of obſtinacy, even to proceed to cenſure and
to caſt them out, as <hi>unſavory ſalt,</hi> if their ſin ſo deſerve.</p>
            <p>And this democracy is neceſſarily aſſumed and exerciſed by
the Church, in chooſing their Officers, and joyntly with them
in admitting members; and in cenſuring, or acquitting, and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting</hi>
offenders: And that to preſerve the Monarchy of Chriſt
from Antichriſtian uſurpation, leſt they ſhould be in forced to
let <hi>men at their pleaſure bear rule over them,</hi> and become as <hi>men
pleaſers, and ſervants of men,</hi> as many have done; and that
without all remedy, or hope of remedy, whiles their Officers
live, as hath been ſaid before, in the like caſe: And all, becauſe
that they had not power within themſelves to cenſure and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
them; but having their <hi>power</hi> to ſeek (form other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
or from without their own,) could never finde it to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
them by, as in conſcience they ought.</p>
            <p>But were forced to yeeld even blinde obedience, and to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
themſelves to what ever decrees were impoſed on them,
whether right or wrong, truth or falſhood, good or evil.</p>
            <p>And what elſe can be juſtly expected form the Presbyterial
Government, if they require obedience to what ever they decree
or determine by Vote, in Claſſis or Synod, or Congregational
Presbytery, when they make it not <hi>manifeſt as they ought to do;</hi>
from ſacred ſcripture, that ſuch decrees are juſt, and ought to
be executed and obeyed, &amp;c. by all or any whom they do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern,
that are under the Government, and of the Kingdom of
Chriſt?</p>
            <p>For what is this but to give them liberty for the abſolute ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
of arbitary power, after men are choſen to ſuch anoffice?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:97084:39"/>
For what is it but <hi>Arbitrary power</hi> (in ſpiritual reſpect:) that
is not ſubmitted to the <hi>Word of God,</hi> to the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi>
and to his <hi>Law and Testimony,</hi> as well as ſuch is accounted
<hi>Arbitrary power</hi> (in civil reſpects) that is not ſubmitted to the
<hi>Laws of the Land?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this cannot chuſe but at leaſt ſometimes engage or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force
us unto blinde obedience (if we ſubmit thereto,) and that
unto men, as if we were neceſſitated to account of them, as if
they could not err.</p>
            <p>And therefore doubtleſs ſuch (whoever they are) that either
claim (as due) or expect ſuch obedience, do extol themſelves
even above the Apoſtles, and expect more obedience, and honor,
and ſervice, then they ever required, who were (notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
more infallibly guided. For they rather commend, then
blamed the <hi>Bereans, for ſearching of the Scriptures, whether
thoſe things were ſo,</hi> that were preached by them.</p>
            <p>And what may this prove, but not onely the infringement of
the Churches liberties, but even the juſt rights and liberties of
the ſubjects, yea, and the priviledg of Parliament: For if the
Parliament were bound, as in duty to God, to eſtabliſh and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
what ever a Synod, or an Aſſembly of Divines, ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
or decree amongſt themſelves, to be juſt and right in the
ſight of God, and that without evidence form <hi>ſacred Scripture,</hi>
What a groſs ſlavery might even their very conſciences be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
to? For was not this the means of introduction of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery
and all ſuperſtition that ever was eſtabliſht in the Chriſtian
world; to wit, obedience unto Synods, as if they could
not err?</p>
            <p>And is it not as dangerous now, leſt men ſhould yet err, and
miſlead the Parliament, and the whole Kingdom, yea, and all
the Churches? Are we ſure that they are more infallible, then
in former ages?</p>
            <p>Doubtleſſe, I ſay, they ought not to challenge, nor expect or
plead for any ſuch obedience, nor that they either do or can do
any thing Authoritatively indeed, but what they make good and
manifeſt from Scripture; for then onely, and onely ſo far forth,
they may Authoritatively ſay, It ſeemed good unto the holy
Ghoſt and us; as hath been ſaid before: for even the Apoſtles
were but drawn together to conſult <hi>and conſider of thoſe things,</hi>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:97084:40"/>
neither did they decree, till <hi>James</hi> ſtood up and reſolved the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
from ſacred Scripture, by concluding ſuch a reſult, as to
which they all aſſented: It was not carryed by multiplicity and
majority of votes, what ſhould be decreed; but by the beſt
Scripture evidence.</p>
            <p>Neither are any ſuch either fit or worthy to be members of
an Aſſembly, Synod, or Claſſis, or congregational Presbytery,
that can be content to let things paſs upon ſlender debate,
and without reſult from Scripture grounds upon bare votes, it
may be inconſiderately gathered, to be made as decrees, for the
Churches Government, and that about matters in controverſie,
concerning faith and doctrine, or ways and manners, or any
ſuch like.</p>
            <p>Conſidering that <hi>the eyes of the chief Seers, in a whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
or Nation,</hi> yea in the whole univerſe, <hi>may be covered:</hi> and
the ſacred Scriptures <hi>may be unto them all as a ſealed book;</hi> yea,
they may <hi>account even the great things of Gods own Law as a
ſtrange thing; as Iſai.</hi> 29. Verſ. 9. to the end. <hi>Micah</hi> 3. 5, 6. 7, 8.
<hi>Hoſea</hi> 8. 12. And yet may think it ſtrange, that ſuch men as they
ſhould either be, or be accounted <hi>blinde;</hi> as thoſe that ſaid unto
Chriſt, <hi>Are we blinde alſo?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore it behoves the Magiſtrates, and all in authority,
to reſtrain and limit them in theſe reſpects that ſo highly concern
even the life and death of their immortal ſouls, and of poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
after them, unto all ages: I ſay, to reſtrain and limit them
<hi>to the Law and Teſtimony</hi> in what ever decrees they decree to
eſtabliſh: elſe they are guilty even of the blood of ſouls, which
they lay open to be bought and ſold at the will and pleaſure of
preſumptuous men, that are <hi>ſelf-willed, and lovers of their own
ſelves, covetous, boasters, proud, &amp;c,</hi> of which ſort there is many
in theſe laſt days.</p>
            <p>6. They are ſtricter, and juſtly too, in keeping themſelves
within their own ſphere, in that they require not obedience
from all the inhabitants within parochial, no nor local bonds;
to the decrees of Synods, Claſſis, and Presbyteries, as <hi>jure divino;</hi>
for that can never be proved from Scripture grounds, to be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
duty or lawful, but onely ſo far forth as their decrees are
juſt, and held forth alſo from Scripture grounds, <hi>in the name of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:97084:40"/>
God, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> to be obeyed, or diſobeyed; not
as they tender the diſpleaſure of men, in what ever authority,
place, or power, Eccleſiaſticall, or Civil; But as they <hi>[tender]</hi>
the breach of <hi>the Law of God,</hi> or their obedience unto <hi>him,</hi> or
as they fear his wrath, or expect his love, and bleſſing, &amp;c. Neither
do they reſolve, to deal with all indefinitely, in a ſpiritual way; as
they are admoniſhed to deal with brethren, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. to 21. by
way of private reproof and admonition; and after that, <hi>to tell
it to the Church;</hi> before they <hi>be unto us as heathens, and publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans;</hi>
for many are ſo to us, even <hi>as heathens and publicans;</hi> even
in the judgement of <hi>Charity,</hi> and certainty both: being yet <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out</hi>
in the Apoſtles ſenſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 12. And <hi>what have we to do with
them that are without;</hi> to whom <hi>all things (as yet) are done in
Parables,</hi> What have we, therefore, to do <hi>to judge them,</hi> the Apoſtle
knew not, that we had any occaſion, nor proper intereſt or pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
ſo to do, ſave only in general in the publike Miniſtry. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are we injoyned, (for altogether) not to company with ſuch;
nor not to eate with ſuch; if they be but <hi>(Fornicators, or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous,
or Extortioners, or Idolaters of this world,)</hi> as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 10,
11. <hi>&amp; Chap.</hi> 10. 27. For we are not bound to <hi>Rebuke Scorners,</hi>
and deale with them <hi>as brethren,</hi> in ſpiritual reſpects; we are
only bound to deale with <hi>breathren,</hi> ſuch who are ſo <hi>called,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
of, through their viſible profeſſion of Chriſtianity: (not of
Atheiſme, and groſſe prophanneſs;) ſuch, who never yet thought
themſelves fit to receive the Sacrament of the Lords Supper: for
how are they <hi>within,</hi> or in fellowſhip with us, or in <hi>company toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
who abhor and hate, and had rather almoſt be in company
with devils, then with ſuch, whoſe waies are a rebuke unto theirs.
And how then ſhall we in any reſpect, <hi>withdraw from ſuch,</hi> who
never yet were in <hi>company</hi> with us, but againſt their wills; 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi>
3. 6.</p>
            <p>And how is it proper, to <hi>judge,</hi> or cenſure; or to <hi>remit,</hi> and
pardon, (as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 7, 8. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 12, 13. <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. 23.) ſuch
who are utterly uncapable of any proper impreſſion, or ſence, or
dinte of a divine <hi>rod;</hi> a ſpiritual cenſure, or admonition, or <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke,
&amp;c.</hi> yea, or of being <hi>remitted,</hi> though they outwardly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,
till they inwardly <hi>repent,</hi> and be at peace with God, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for open, but for all their ſins, open, and ſecret; unleſs men pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely

man, he that is injur'd, upon <hi>Repentance may forgive it;</hi> as <hi>Mat.</hi>

and whether they repent indeed. And men can only do it, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively
and effectually, in his ſacred Name; according to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
or viſibility of their cordiall repentance (in their appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion;)
not for one onely, but for for all their ſins, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 10,

            <p>And thus much briefly againſt the <hi>Preſbyterians,</hi> for the time
preſent, though I have more particulars to have inſtanced in; yet
if in theſe particulars, a reconcilement were made, the reſt would
follow with more eaſe.</p>
            <p>But theſe things being true, as I am confident that any rational
man (that will but ſeriouſly conſider of theſe particulars, with the
grounds and reaſons, that are here alledged, with an impartial eye)
will freely confeſs, that the <hi>Independents</hi> are juſtly ſtricter, and
ought ſo to be, in theſe particulars; and that their grounds and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
are ſound and ſubſtantiall for ſo doing, and that the Magiſtrate
ought not to reſtrain or limit them, in the proſecution of theſe juſt,
and lawful, and godly ends: But to tollerate, and protect them,
and incourage them hereunto, by all poſſible means: yea, though
in theſe reſpects, they be manifeſtly ſtricter then the <hi>Preſbyterial</hi>
Government, as it now ſtands, will permit and ſuffer.</p>
            <p>And now having done with the <hi>Preſbyterians,</hi> for the time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
in behalf of the <hi>Independents:</hi> I ſhall turn my hand to the
<hi>Independents,</hi> in behalf of <hi>Preſbyterians;</hi> for though I cannot cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritably
conceit them, in reſpect of their ends; to wit, that they
are not good; yet, I have ſomething againſt them, in reſpect of
their ways, and dare not be partial in the things of God; but muſt
ſpeak out, according to my apprehenſion, as well againſt them, as
the <hi>Preſbyterians;</hi> for it is dangerous to be partial in the Law, or
reſpect perſons. <hi>Job.</hi> 32. 22.</p>
            <p>1. And firſt then, though it is not denyed, but that in caſe of
neceſſity ſuch a Congregation ſo incorporated, (being men of fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity;
<hi>faithful men)</hi> may ordain themſelves Paſtors, Elders, and
Deacons, as they ſtand in need, and exerciſe all ſpiritual Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
power amongſt themſelves, as they ſee cauſe, for the glory
of God, and the Churches good. For in caſe, when no other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors
of other Churches can conveniently be obtained to aſſiſt
them therein, to whom it more fitly and properly appertains,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:97084:41"/>
being called by the Church ſo to do; It is confeſſed they may doe
it themſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> But in ordinary propriety, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>The leſſe
is bleſſed of the greater;</hi> for he ſo concludes, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6. 7. that it is
ſo <hi>without contradiction,</hi> proving that <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> was <hi>greater
then Abraham,</hi> becauſe <hi>he bleſſed him,</hi> verſ. 4. 7.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argu.</hi> But Ordination by impoſition of hands, is an act of
bleſſing; and is effectual to confer a bleſſing in the Name of God,
if adminiſtred in faith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 19. though otherwiſe not, as
<hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 6, 7, 8.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conſeq.</hi> 1. And therefore by conſequence, The more faithful
that men are, and the more likely, ſuch their bleſſing is to be effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual,
and to be conferred indeed; as many inſtances mght eaſily be
produced.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conſeq.</hi> 2. And therefore it follows, That the moſt faithful
that can be obtained, is the moſt fit for ſuch an act; becauſe it is moſt
likely, that ſuch their bleſſing will be effectuall, the more and
rather.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> And therefore it was, that <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> did, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to modeſty, object againſt Chriſt, when he came to his Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme,
<hi>I have need</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to be baptized of thee, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt
thou to me?</hi> But our Saviour anſwered, that he ſhould <hi>let
be now,</hi> becauſe that <hi>thus it became them, to fulfil all Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the Reaſon was, becauſe in common reputation (at that
time) <hi>Iohn</hi> was greater then he: <hi>For all men held that Iohn was
a Prophet:</hi> But Chriſt as yet had not <hi>ſhewed forth his glory,</hi> in ſo
eminent a manner, as to be ſo eſteemed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But it is objected, That a <hi>[Church of beleevers]</hi> or a
company of the <hi>[Preſbytery]</hi> are, in comon reputation, greater then
<hi>[one,]</hi> to wit, any <hi>[one]</hi> man whom they may ordain, and ſo in
that reſpect, <hi>The leſſe is bleſſed of the greater,</hi> as <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6. 7. <hi>For
two,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon) are better then oNe.</hi> And the promiſe is
made unto <hi>two or three.</hi> Mat. 18.</p>
            <p>Therefore it follows, if <hi>two or three</hi> be preferred to one, that a
whole Church <hi>of faithful men</hi> are better then <hi>two or three,</hi> and
greater in eſteem, and their prayers, or bleſſings, are the more likely
to be valide and effectual.</p>
            <p>And therefore it is not unfit in that reſpect, but proper and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:97084:42"/>
comely, and ſo much the more hopeful, that ſuch their bleſſing,
through <hi>faith in God,</hi> will be effectual, though they want the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of ſome more eminent men (then ſuch yet are) whom they
do ordain: <hi>The prayer of a righteous man availeth much,</hi> ſaith
<hi>James, if it be fervent,</hi> Jam. 5. 16. And how much more available
may we expect the <hi>prayers of a whole Church</hi> will be with God,
as it was when <hi>Peter was in priſon?</hi> Act. 12. 5.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> I anſwer briefly, That it is not unlawful, but may be done,
and not improperly, in caſe of neceſſity, as hath been ſaid.</p>
            <p>But, firſt, obſerve, That the addition of ſome more eminent men
to be, as it were, the mouth and hands of ſuch a whole Church, doth
not deminiſh, but encreaſe their number of faithful men, if ſuch can
be obtain'd to aſſiſt them therein, and ſo by their own Argument
ſo much greater bleſſings are likely to be conferred at their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt.</p>
            <p>And it may he ſometimes that the prayers of ſome one man being
more earneſt then the reſt, may obtain the bleſſing, or ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
requeſt, rather then all the reſt; as it is ſaid of <hi>Elias, James</hi> 5.
17. 18. <hi>and</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 2. 12. <hi>The Charrets and Horſemen of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> For it is not becauſe of the number of Interceſſors, nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of the righteouſneſs [only] of ſuch, or ſo many as ſhall pray
unto him, that he grants their requeſt; but it is rather becauſe of
their <hi>faithfulneſs and fervency in ſuch very particular for which
they pray,</hi> as <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 6, 7, 8. &amp; <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. 16. For it ſometimes falls
out, that men that are the moſt faithful ordinarily, yet may in ſome
particulars be more diffident then the weakeſt, ſo that their <hi>faith
failing them, they begin to ſink;</hi> as <hi>Peter</hi> on the water, though he
had walked already, through the power of God, yet the ſight of a
ſtorm ſtruck him into doubts; and you know the place where it is
ſaid of Chriſt himſelf, That <hi>he [could] do no great works there, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of their unbelief.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore it is not the bare form of ordination, though admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred
by never ſo many, or never ſo eminent men, that can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
for a bleſſing on ſuch or ſuch a man; but it is the fervency and
faithfulneſs of ſuch who do ordain them that obtains the bleſſing;
for by how much ſtronger men are in faith in that very particular,
ſo much the more powerful they are with God to obtain his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
and the preſence and power of the Holy Ghoſt to be in greater
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:97084:42"/>
meaſure conferred upon him to enlarge and enable him for ſuch a
work, and for ſervice to his name in ſuch an office.</p>
            <p>And therefore ſuch men, who in the general apprehenſion of ſuch
a Church, are the moſt faithful and fervent in ſpirit that can be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd,
and the moſt inward and familiar with God, ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted,
and ſought unto by ſuch a Church to aſſiſt them in ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of any ſuch officer, and to be their mouth and hands unto God,
even the mouth and hands of the whole Church, who (as it is grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
ought to be preſent, and to joyn in prayer together with them.</p>
            <p>And thus to do, is not to [aliene] their own liberties in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,
for they may do it themſelves in caſe of neceſſity, as hath been
ſaid, when there is not to be had more eminent and faithful men
then is amongſt themſelves, or if they cannot obtain them: For it
doth not take ſuch liberties from them, nor power to uſe them, in
caſe of neceſſity, becauſe that others aſſiſt them at their requeſt, no
more then another Miniſter, praying or preaching together with
them at their requeſt, takes away from them their proper liberty of
praying themſelves.</p>
            <p>And therefore I ſhall much wonder if any godly conſciencious
man ſhall oppoſe this doctrine, though the cuſtom hath been (as
they were inſtructed by ſome of their Miniſters) to practiſe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe:
yea, and though I alſo ſpeak it in behalf of thoſe of the
Presbyterial way, for I do not ſpeak it in behalf of men;
but in behalf of the truth, which I ought to eſteem before all
the men on the face of the earth; I therefore ſpeak it, becauſe I
beleeve, that <hi>thus it becometh them, to fulfil all righteouſneſs:</hi> For
greatneſs in reputation ought to be preferred in ſuch publike <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations</hi>
above greatneſs in deed, for <hi>Chriſt</hi> was greater [in deed]
then <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> though not in <hi>[Reputation]</hi> at the time of his
<hi>Baptiſm,</hi> and therefore <hi>ſo it became them; to fulfill all righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi>
Mat. 3. 24, 15. For <hi>without all contradiction the leſs is bleſſed
of the greater</hi> in ordinary ways, at leaſt <hi>of the greater</hi> in Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
<hi>John had need to be baptized of Chriſt,</hi> the leſs of the greater,
to this Chriſt aſſents; but <hi>John</hi> was greater in Reputation at that
preſent time, therefore it became them rather to follow the general
Reputation, then the inherent power for Baptization, wherein ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
the greatneſs in deed in reſpect of power.</p>
            <p>For the Original of <hi>Power is only in God,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 5. Not <hi>not in
him that planteth, nor in him that watereth:</hi> And is but appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:97084:43"/>
or fetched out by faith, as by an immediate hand, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
adminiſtred, according to the ſtrength or meaſure of faith,
in ſuch an Inſtrument, by whom ſuch bleſſing or benefit whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
is mediately adminiſtred.</p>
            <p>It was not properly the <hi>ſpirit of Moſes</hi> that <hi>was put upon the
Elders,</hi> Numb. 11. though it was ſo called, Verſ. 17. even <hi>the Spirit
that was on him;</hi> but it was more properly even <hi>the Spirit of the
Lord,</hi> as Verſ. 29. that <hi>reſted on the Elders,</hi> and on <hi>Moſes</hi> both; and
in that reſpect only it is properly ſaid, That <hi>the Lord took off the
Spirit that was on him, and put it upon them,</hi> as Verſ. 25. 26, 17.
for it was no other but the <hi>ſelf-ſame Spirit, even the Spirit of God,</hi>
though <hi>meaſured out</hi> as it pleaſed him, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.</p>
            <p>We muſt not therefore expect the <hi>bleſſing,</hi> becauſe adminiſtred
in ſuch a way, or in ſuch a manner, no, nor by <hi>faithful men,</hi> (though
we may the rather,) but becauſe adminiſtred <hi>through faith indeed,
in the name of God,</hi> whom we ought to acknowledg as the onely
<hi>fountain</hi> and original ſpring from whence it is derived, and variouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diſperſt, <hi>as it pleaſeth him,</hi> as <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 16, 17, 18. and is not
in the power or cuſtody of men to give the encreaſe, or bleſſing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 7. And therefore all the Ordinances (though
never ſo purely and properly adminiſtred, in reſpect of order, and
forms of <hi>Government</hi> or <hi>Adminiſtrations)</hi> will be utterly vain, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valid,
empty, fruitleſs, and unprofitable, unleſs miniſtred in <hi>Faith,</hi>
yea, <hi>through Faith in God, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and that
in every particular: for it is not ſufficient that ſuch adminiſtrators
have <hi>Faith in God</hi> for the ſaving of their ſouls, but they muſt have
<hi>Faith</hi> to apprehend his promiſes, concerning ſuch particulars, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they adminiſter, or deſire of God to be done for them upon
ſuch occaſions; or elſe they may <hi>not expect to receive ſuch things,</hi>
as <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 6, 7. And therefore the moſt faithful is weak enough for
the meaneſt <hi>adminiſtration</hi> in the Church of God.</p>
            <p>And therefore the end of <hi>ordination</hi> being the <hi>bleſſing,</hi> the
means to attain it ſhould be ſo ordered, as is moſt likely to attain
unto, or acquire this end: we ſhould <hi>ſo run, that we might obtain:</hi>
For, in ſuch publique caſes, men often <hi>take Gods name in vain</hi> for
want of ayming chiefly at the proper end of any <hi>ſervice, duty,</hi> or
<hi>ordinance</hi> that men take in hand.</p>
            <p>But thus much briefly for this particular, becauſe I hope no man
will contradict what is here aſſerted.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:97084:43"/>
2. A ſecond thing that I have againſt the <hi>Independent Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
is briefly this, to wit,</p>
            <p>That though they do allow of conſociation of Churches for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
and counſel, and for the help and encouragement, reſolving,
comforting, &amp;c. or for the diſcouragement, forſaking, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction,
or withdrawing from, as need requires:</p>
            <p>Yet they do not allow of any authoritative acting, by an Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
of ſuch Churches, either for, or againſt any particular Church,
though need require ſo to do; but do account it ſufficient to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
<hi>communion,</hi> if they ſo deſerve, according to <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. as the
direction is, to deal with a brother in caſe of treſpaſs, not conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that this directory is onely given out, how we ought to deal, in
caſe of treſpaſs, againſt man, one brother againſt another, and that
in ſuch treſpaſſes as deſerve not <hi>excommunication</hi> out of ſuch a
Church, but a private <hi>withdrawing of brotherly fellowſhip</hi> by that
particular man againſt whom the treſpaſs is committed, to wit,
<hi>Let him be unto thee as an heathen man, and as a Publican,</hi> Verſ.
17. It is not ſaid, that either ſuch a man, or any other, for treſpaſs
properly againſt man, ſhould be excommunicated from the <hi>publique
ordinances;</hi> but they are firſt admoniſhed <hi>to note ſuch by a letter,
and have no company with them, that they might be aſhamed,</hi> to
ſee how that will work to bring them to repentance; but they
muſt not for ſuch faults <hi>account them as enemies, but admoniſh
them as brethren,</hi> as 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3. 14, 15. <hi>and bear them patiently,</hi>
yea, though we think of them, that they <hi>are evil men,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.
24, 25, 26. For we may eaſily be deceived, eſpecially in our own
cauſe, and be apt to <hi>judg and cenſure</hi> without <hi>moderation:</hi> And
<hi>Excommunication</hi> ought onely to be adminiſtred in caſe of ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
God, when we can ſcarce, in the judgment of <hi>charity,</hi> think
any better of them, but that they are <hi>wicked men, caſt out from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
your ſelves: That [wicked man]</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
5. 13. and of this ſort alſo were <hi>Hymeneus and Alexander,</hi> who
had <hi>made ſhipwrack of Faith,</hi> and fell to <hi>Blasphemy;</hi> beſides
which, or for ſuch like groſs and notorious ſins, and that againſt
God, we read not of any that were <hi>delivered unto Satan like</hi>
thoſe, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 19, 20.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argu.</hi> But this directory of our bleſſed <hi>Saviour,</hi> going no
further but to private withdrawing, in caſe of treſpaſs, brother a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
brother, is not ſufficient to direct the Church how ſhe ought
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:97084:44"/>
to deal, in caſe of ſins deſerving that dreadful ſentence of <hi>Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication:</hi>
but we muſt likewiſe take in, for further direction, that
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. and many other Scriptures, as you ſhall hear anon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conſequ.</hi> Therefore it follows, That as a particular Church is
bound as well to deal with offendors (if they ſo deſerve) by that
heavy ſentence of <hi>Excommunication,</hi> as <hi>withdraw</hi> their commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
and fellowſhip from them in caſe of leſſer ſins:</p>
            <p>Even ſo in like caſe, Churches conſociated ought to deal with
offending Churches (if they ſo deſerve) by that heavy ſentence of
<hi>Excommunication,</hi> as well as withdraw their communion from
them in caſe of leſſer ſins: And the Churches cenſures of <hi>Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication</hi>
ought not to be bounded within the verge of particular
churches againſt particular perſons; but ought to be executed againſt
whole Churches by the ſiſter Churches (conſociated and aſſembled
for that very end) if their ſin ſo deſerve; as in caſe of <hi>toleration of
blaspemy, or idolatry, or Sabbath-breaking, or adultery,</hi> and ſuch
like groſs <hi>prophaneſs</hi> in the Members of the Church, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.
10, 11, 12. and do not cenſure them for it. And take notice by
the way, That I therefore ſay <hi>[in the Members of the Church]</hi>
becauſe ſuch who are profane, and never profeſſed <hi>Repentance,</hi>
nor <hi>Faith in God, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> though they come
to the Church, yet they are not capable of <hi>Excommunication,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
that even in the judgment of <hi>Charity</hi> they are as yet <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,</hi>
in the Apoſtles ſence, and are not of ſuch as are called <hi>brethren;</hi>
but being already <hi>without,</hi> and in the <hi>power,</hi> and <hi>ſlavery,</hi> and <hi>cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity
of Satan,</hi> need no more caſting out, nor delivering unto him:
but it were groſs foolery to ſpend the Churches cenſures upon ſuch
wicked men, neither could it be expected to be effectual againſt
them, nor take impreſſion on them; And therefore the Apoſtle
doth not for altogether inhibit our <hi>companying together with ſuch,</hi>
as Verſ. 10. but <hi>with ſuch</hi> (amongſt ſuch) <hi>as are called brethren;
with ſuch a one, that they ſhould not eat:</hi> Whereas in another
place, <hi>If any man that beleeved not invited them to a feaſt, if they
were dispoſed to go,</hi> they might go; for he giveth them no inhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in that caſe, but onely a directory how to carry themſelves,
as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 27.</p>
            <p>And it is but a fooliſh thing to bring men to the ſtool of <hi>repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi>
for ſome one particular notorious ſin, till they can alſo profeſs
and ſeriouſly too, as before God, that they repent for all, both
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:97084:44"/>
ſecret and open, and do hope for pardon. And it is but a deluding
of mens conſciences, to put them in hope of pardon for <hi>one,</hi> till they
repent for <hi>all,</hi> and do reſolve to forſake them, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 10. 11.</p>
            <p>And thus much by the way; I do now come to the point, and do
briefly aſſert:</p>
            <p>Aſſert. <hi>That it is the duty of true Chriſtian Chuches, joyntly
conſociate, or aſſembled together, not only</hi> to admoniſh, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
communion, <hi>as hath been ſaid; And as it is granted by Mr.</hi>
Cotton, <hi>in the way of the Churches of</hi> N. E. pag. 109. Sect. 6.
<hi>to wit,</hi> That they look at it, as their duty, to be faithfull one
Church to another; in like ſort, as the brethren of one Church
are called to be faithful one towards another; In regard that
Churches enjoy, and profeſſe communion one with another, as well
as brethren of a particular Church; alledging Cant. 8. 8. &amp; 2
Cor. 11. 28. <hi>Look alſo</hi> Sect. 7.</p>
            <p>But that therefore, it likewiſe follows, even from their own ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument;
That an aſſembly of Churches, is alſo bound to <hi>deliver
unto Satan, in the Name of God, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and
by his power &amp;c.</hi> any ſuch Church, as ſhall ſo deſerve; or the
Officers, or Miniſters of any ſuch Church, who ſhall ſo deſerve,
if their own Church ſhall neglect to do it; elſe, they deal not faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
with ſuch Miniſters, or brethren, not with ſuch a Church, as
in duty they are bound, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. after the Apoſtles doctrine and
example, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 19. 20. as hath been ſaid: Nay, if they but
<hi>call themſelves brethren, or Miniſters of Christ, Rev.</hi> 2. 2, 20.
21. or <hi>Churches of Christ,</hi> as <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 9. yea, <hi>Jews and
are not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They ought, I ſay, to be dealt with, by Divine authority, in the
name of Chriſt, as <hi>Synagogues of Satan,</hi> as <hi>falſe Apoſtles,</hi> as
<hi>wicked Iezebels,</hi> as <hi>lying brethren;</hi> And ſo proclaimed (joyntly)
by the Churches, with one conſent, and <hi>delivered to Satan, that
they might learn, not to blaſpheme, or not to ſeduce, and deceive
the ſervants, and people of God;</hi> nor call <hi>themſelves Apoſtles
and miniſters of Christ, when they are not;</hi> or <hi>his Miniſters and
Embaſſadors,</hi> in ſuch things and meſſages, wherein <hi>they are not;</hi>
as <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. 2, 20. or <hi>call themſelves Jews,</hi> or <hi>of the people of God,</hi>
and <hi>are nothing ſo,</hi> as <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 9. but do lye notoriouſly, and that
in the name of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>I ſay, the Cenſures of the Church ought to paſs upon them, in
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:97084:45"/>
as publike and declarative a way and manner, acco<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ding to their

the Lord Ieſus Chriſt; whoſe judgement it is, that ought to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred,
and publikely held forth in his ſacred Name, with the
grounds thereof, from the <hi>Law and Testimony,</hi> if men ſo deſerve,
even to execration.</p>

               <hi>And if</hi> Admonition, and in ſome caſes Excommunication, be
Ordinances of God, ſanctified for the healing of the ſoules of Gods
people gone aſtray; it were a ſacrilegious injury, either to the
Miniſters, or Elders, or to whole Churches, when they goe aſtray,
to deprive them of the benefit of ſuch wholeſome medicines, when
the eſtate of their ſouls ſtand in need thereof: <hi>as ſo their own
arguments doth plainly reſolve, in the way of the Churches of</hi> N.

            <p>But it cannot be denyed, but even whole Churches may ſo far
Apoſtatize, and go aſtray, either in life, or doctrine, or govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> For ſuppoſe all the Congregation do not act ſo wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as to be <hi>Fornicators, Idolaters,</hi> or <hi>Adulterers, &amp;c.</hi> yet they
may be induced to connive, and indulge, and be acceſſary with ſuch
in a great meaſure, as the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were, with the <hi>Inceſtious

               <hi>And if after admonition in ſuch caſes, as are proper for ſuch

or if any Church ſhall tollerate Idolatry, Blaſphemy, or
Prophaneſs, all ſiſter Churches ought in ſuch caſes, to proceed
roundly againſt them.</hi> Look in the way of the Church of <hi>New Eng:
pag.</hi> 93. But for more certain teſtimony, examine and compare
theſe Scriptures following, to wit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 11. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 6. <hi>Deu.</hi>
13. 5, 6, &amp;c. to the end. <hi>Exod.</hi> 33. 7. <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 45, 46. <hi>Iudg.</hi> 20.

               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:97084:45"/>
48. 10, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 14. And ſuch like many Prophetical, Popular, and
National curſes, which are exemplary for us to uſe in like caſes:
And they are no other, but the expreſs mind and will of God;
which being unchangeable, ought to be publiſhed, and declarative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
held forth, as occaſion requires; and the more publike, and the
more viſible and general that it is, and the more faithfully, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatically
that it is expreſt, and the better it is, and the more likely
that it ſhould be effectual for the end thereof; yea, the more voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
that proclaim it, or aſſent unto it, with affection of minde,
and faith in God, ſutable thereunto; and it is the more available,
and acceptable with God, and efficacious and operative on the
hearts of men, to deter, and reſtrain them from any ſuch
wickedneſs. And what need we any more, or more plaine injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
then the Apoſtle hath given us: to wit, <hi>If any man love
not the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, let him be had in execration, yea
maranatha:</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 22. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 19, 20.</p>
            <p>They had once occaſion to have uſed theſe curſes in the name of
God, againſt ſome Members of famous Churches in <hi>New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
and ſome it may be, might finde occaſion to uſe them here,
againſt ſuch ſpies as bring an evill report upon the Land of <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an;</hi>
the <hi>[Spiritual]</hi> I mean. And doubtleſs, if uſed in faith, as
they ought, they would be effectual; for many ſuch Spies are cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of judgement from the hand of God, as wel as theſe, who
dyed of the plague before the Lord; as <hi>Numb.</hi> 14. 36, 37. Yea,
good men, whoſe ſouls ſhall be ſaved, may yet deſerve to be made
exemplary by the hand of God, in ſuch a caſe, for the terror of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
as ſo (no doubt) were <hi>Nadab, and Abihu, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zza,</hi>
and others, as we may well hope; for even <hi>Aaron</hi> himſelf, was
admoniſhed by <hi>Moſes,</hi> how to carry himſelf, leſt he alſo ſhould dye
before the Lord, if he were provoked, <hi>Numb.</hi> 18 3.</p>
            <p>And this kinde of <hi>Divine Authority</hi> is far more awful, and fit
to be uſed in all ſuch caſes; then carnal, worldly, and humane au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority;
as the effects would prove, if miniſtred in faith, as <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes</hi>
1. 5, 6, 7, 8. <hi>and by the power of our Lord Jeſus Christ,</hi> as
1 <hi>Cor,</hi> 5. 4. to wit, <hi>through faith in his name;</hi> confidently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving,
that according to his promiſe, he will make it effectual;
and ratifie in heaven, <hi>what ever they agree on, or binde on earth or
denounce, &amp;c.</hi> as <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. For if a man <hi>have faith in God,</hi>
yea though never ſo little, if it <hi>be but as a graine of Muſtard-ſeed,</hi>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:97084:46"/>
provided it be concerning ſuch very particulars, is he prayeth for,
or deſireth to be done; yea, though it were for <hi>removing trees,
and planting them in the middeſt of the Sea,</hi> it ſhould doubtleſſe
be effectual, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. 25. Yea, <hi>What ever yee aske of God in
prayer, beleeve that ye ſhall receive it, and it ſhall be given you,</hi>
ſaith our Savior Chriſt, <hi>Mar.</hi> 11. 22, 23, 24. <hi>Mat.</hi> 17. 20. <hi>Luk.</hi> 17. 6.</p>
            <p>And this Divine Authority, this <hi>power through faith,</hi> being mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred
in his <hi>Name,</hi> as it ought to be, is a far greater, and more
awful authority, then any humane power, or carnal authority, that
can be given by men, in what place ſoever; for it is indeed <hi>The
power of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ſpoken of, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
5. 5. <hi>It is the power God. Mat.</hi> 18. 18, 19, 20. fetched down from
heaven, by the hand of faith.</p>
            <p>3. A third thing that I have againſt the <hi>Independent</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
is their ſtrictneſs in trial of all, whom they admit to partake of
the Sacraments. But leſt I ſhould be over-tedious, and there being
many Arguments, which have long been oppoſed each againſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
concerning this maine difference, which if once reconciled,
all other differences, would eaſily be agreed.</p>
            <p>I ſhall therefore propoſe my own apprehenſions, partly abrevia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
what hath formerly been ſaid in ſome particulars, by way of
reſult, and then ſhall anſwer ſome objections concerning this main
difference, and ſhall ſo conclude, leſt my Book ſhould ſwell to a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
Volumn.</p>
            <p>After that a particular Church is conſtituted and organiz'd, for
adminiſtration of all the ordinances they ought to obſerve; theſe
enſuing Rules, as moſt conſonant with the practice of the Apoſtles,
and of all the Churches in the Primitive times, and moſt ſutable to
the Word of God, and the rule of Charity therein contained; and
to his own ways, held forth to us for our imitation, who profeſs
oour ſelves <hi>to be followers of God as his dear children, and to walke
in love, as Chriſt hath loved us;</hi> and do account the <hi>end of the
Commandment to be love, out of a pure heart, and a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and of faith unfeigned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Firſt, It ought to be their chief care and endeavour, that</hi> the
preaching of the Word <hi>(which is the chief means that God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed</hi>
for the ſaving of ſouls) <hi>be with all diligence, publickly
adminiſtred, both to beleevers and infidels, even to all comers, with
this end, and reſpect chiefly, That ſuch who are already beleevers,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:97084:46"/>
might be edified</hi> in faith and love, which are in Chriſt Jeſus,
<hi>and that others might be</hi> convinced, and converted, and turned to
the faith, <hi>yea, and that</hi> even all ſuch whom God hath ordained to
eternal life through Jeſus Christ: <hi>for care ſhould be taken,</hi> that
non ſhould be loſt, <hi>nor</hi> go aſtray, <hi>nor</hi> be offened <hi>in any reſpect,</hi> that
neither bruiſedreeds ſhould be broken off, nor ſmoking flax extinct,
or quenched; <hi>nor that</hi> which is halting be turned out of the way, but
rather healed, and reſtored, yea blown and kindled, and bound up, and
mollified, and helped, and ſtrengthned, <hi>by all poſſible means that
God hath appointed in his holy Word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Secondly, as <hi>ſaving of ſoul,</hi> and <hi>edifying of the Church,</hi> is the
chief buſineſs to be cared for, and indeavoured by the Church, and
as the <hi>miniſtry of the Word</hi> is the chief means tending thereunto: ſo
it neceſſarily follows, that not only for the preſent, but for future
likewiſe, proviſion be made, that none be <hi>elected,</hi> nor admitted into office,
as <hi>Miniſter of the Word, to labour in the word and doctrine,
nor to rule and govern, or miniſter to the poor, as Deacons, &amp;c.</hi> but
ſuch who are ſo qualified, as the Word of God requires they ſhould;
that ſo they might not be lead, either by <hi>blind guides,</hi> or <hi>Idol ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds,
dumb dogs, devouring wolves, ſoul-murtherers, falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi>
that <hi>ſew pillows under all armholes;</hi> and flatter men into a
fools paradiſe, being <hi>partial in the Law,</hi> or profane and ſcandalous
in any reſpect: as the Scripture is large for direction herein, how
they ought to be qualified, <hi>through faith, and love, which are in
Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Act. 6. 3. Not any officer, no not the Deacons, but care
ſhould be taken, that they ſhould be <hi>men of honeſt report, full of the
holy Ghoſt and wiſdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Thirdly, that in any poſſibility, this might be ſecured, and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for, not only for the preſent, but for future generations (as much
as poſſible) it ought to be the care of every Member of that body
corporate, that viſible Church ſo joyned, and conſtituted;</p>
            <p>That none be admitted, and joyned, or incorporated together
with them, either firſt, or laſt, either for the time preſent, or for
future generations: But ſuch only, in whom all the members of the
ſaid body (In the judgment of charity) may juſtly confide, that they
will not, to their knowledge (either in Elections, or Ejections, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probations,
or reſults, in any Church-buſneſs, either for receiving
in, or caſting out, or any matter wherein their voice or ſufferage
is juſtly requiſite, as a member of the body) deal unjuſtly or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially,
perfidiouſly or unfaithfully, but as <hi>before God, and the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:97084:47"/>
Lord Jeſus Christ, and the Elect Angels;</hi> Leſt in after times,
by means of <hi>ungodly men, which might be crept in,</hi> if care be not
taken, and proviſion made, to keep ſuch out, they that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
might <hi>heap to themſelves Teachers after their own hearts,</hi>
ſuch as have been mentioned: And therefore ſo far forth as ſuch
body corporate is in any reſpect politically joyned, for the good
of the whole, every member being part of the whole, and
therefore having intereſt in the whole it ſelf, and that not onely
for the good of the reſt, but for it ſelf likewiſe; and therefore
ought in conſcience to have vote and ſufferage amongſt the reſt,
in all ſuch caſes as concern the whole, for the good of all.</p>
            <p>So every member ought to be careful, that none be admitted
as joynt members, and incorporated with them, as a body po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litique,
but ſuch in whom they do and can confide; That they
will not, to their knowledg, in any ſuch caſe, either deal un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfully
concerning the whole, or any particular member, in
any ſuch reſpect; but, as hath been ſaid, for <hi>the glory of God,</hi>
and the good of the body.</p>
            <p>And not onely ſo, but tryal ſhould be had concerning their
knowledg and ſpiritual underſtanding, both <hi>in the things of
God,</hi> and that concern the Church, in reſpect of Government
and Diſcipline thereof, that they be both <hi>ſound, and able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
even of things that differ,</hi> in ſome good meaſure; and be
likewiſe conſcientious, ſuitable thereunto.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For, as they that are</hi> weak ought to be received, though not unto
doubtful disputations:</p>
            <p>So, <hi>they that are weak ought to be received, but not unto doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Elections,</hi> and ſuch like buſineſs, as neceſſarily require, that
men ſhould underſtand and know, what they do, when they act
therein.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And therefore it was, that though</hi> all the Levites were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
of God, and taken for all the first born of the Children of
Iſrael:</p>
            <p>And given as a gift to Aaron and to his ſons, from among the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of Iſrael, to do the ſervice of the children of Iſrael in the
Tabernacle of the Congregation: and to make an attonement for
the children of Iſrael, that there be no plague among the children of
Iſrael: When the children of Iſrael came nigh unto the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary,
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:97084:47"/>
               <hi>Yet they were not required, as called of God, to go in,</hi> and
wait on the ſervice of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, but
from twenty five years old and upwards; <hi>and ſo but to continue</hi>
till they came to fifty years old, <hi>and were then</hi> to ceaſe waiting
on the ſervice thereof, and ſhould ſerve no more, <hi>as</hi> Levit. 8. 18, 19, 24, 25.</p>
            <p>So that it evidently appears, That till they came to ripeneſs of
years, and to a ſuitable diſcretion and gravity, for ſuch holy
ſervice, it did not appertain unto them to adminiſter in ſuch a
ſervice.</p>
            <p>And ſo no more it doth to men that are <hi>true Beleevers,</hi> and
<hi>truly faithful,</hi> till they come to maturity and ripeneſs in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg,
and have their <hi>wits exerciſed,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
both good and evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>For it is all one, to be led by others that are</hi> blinde guides, <hi>as
to act of our ſelves</hi> ignorantly and blindly; not knowing what
we do, or ſpeak, or whereof we affirm; <hi>For we may</hi> ſpeak evil or
good, and that injuriouſly, of the things we know not: <hi>And ſo,
through</hi> blinde guidance, periſh in the ditch.</p>
            <p>4. And fourthly, This being ſo, and that ſuch Church affairs
are of ſuch weighty conſequence and concernment to every
member, and for the good of all, and for the ſaving of ſouls;
That it is not poſſible men ſhould be too provident and <hi>circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect</hi>
in theſe reſpects.</p>
            <p>It is therefore requiſite, and that which is the duty of every
member of ſuch a body, to take care, that none be admitted to
be incorporated, and joyned with them, to have power and vote
in the general buſineſs, but ſuch onely as are known and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
for faithfulneſs and ſincerity in true Chriſtianity, in the
practiſe of piety and of religious ſervice and worſhip of God in
all ſuch duties both private and in publique, as God requires.</p>
            <p>And though they be thus known and approved by ſome that
are Officers and members of ſuch body politique, Yet for fuller
ſatisfaction unto all the reſt, it will be needful that they ſhould
openly and publiquely, before all the Church, not onely <hi>profeſs
their faith in God, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and their repentance</hi>
and reſolution <hi>through the grace of God, to forſake all their ſins,</hi>
and to carry themſelves ſuitable unto ſuch profeſſion <hi>both before
God and men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:97084:48"/>
But, for further ſecurity and ſatisfaction to all the Church, they
ought to be engaged, by entering into Covenant both with God and
the Church, to continue faithful and juſt, and to deal <hi>impartially</hi> in
all ſuch reſpects, according to their knowledg, as God ſhall aſsiſt
and ſtrengthen them ſo to do; and thus far, and in theſe reſpects,
ſuch particular body can never be too careful, nor take too ſtrict
tryal of ſuch who are admitted to be Members of the ſame.</p>
            <p>But if they be not careful and ſtrict herein, the <hi>men of this world
ſhall riſe up in judgment againſt them, and condemn them herein;</hi>
who in civil Corporations are careful and ſtrict, that none be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to have vote amongſt them, in Election of Officers, for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
thereof, but ſuch only as (having ſerved an Apprenticeſhip
ſome certain time) are experienced amongſt them, and practiſed in
their Trades, and are ſo made free; and that ſaying of Chriſt is juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
verified againſt all ſuch, <hi>That the men of this world are wiſer in
their generation, then the children of light,</hi> and will be applyed in
diſpleaſure againſt them, if they know theſe things, and will not
obey and do accordingly; yea, even the <hi>blood of ſouls</hi> will one day
be required even at their hands, if they will not be careful and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
and provident in the uſe of means, which properly tend to the
ſaving or damning of immortal ſouls.</p>
            <p>5. And fifthly, on the other part, for the <hi>Adminiſtration</hi> of the
<hi>Sacrament of Baptiſm,</hi> and of the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> ſuch particular
Church ought not to be ſtrict, nor ridged and ſevere, but with all
charity, meekneſs and patience, bear the <hi>infirmities</hi> and burdens of
others, and may not pleaſe themſelves; as theſe Scriptures hold forth
unto us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 14. &amp; <hi>Chap.</hi> 13. &amp; <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. 32, 33. &amp; <hi>Acts</hi> 2.
41. 42. <hi>Chap.</hi> 16. 15. <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. 37. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 16. <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
10, 11.</p>
            <p>And therefore, firſt, the Sacrament of Baptiſm ought to be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred
unto all ſuch children, one or both of whoſe legitimate pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
are <hi>true beleevers,</hi> I mean, beleevers of the <hi>true Chriſtian
Faith,</hi> though yet for the preſent their faith is not juſtifying, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of themſelves, but meerly Hiſtorical, as <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 37. If they be
not <hi>dogs or ſwine, ſcorners of,</hi> or barkers againſt the ways of God,
and his Church and People.</p>
            <p>And this alſo is but only to be expected to be held forth or mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted
to the Church in the ſerious and publike profeſſion and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment
thereof in the publike Congregation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:97084:48"/>
For it was no more that <hi>Philip</hi> required of the Eunuch, and <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
of the Jaylor, whoſe whole <hi>houſhold was baptized of him upon
ſuch profeſſion:</hi> Yea, though they be ſuch men who are not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittable
to the bleſſed Sacrament of the Lords Supper, by reaſon of
ſcandal, which may lie upon them, yet if they earneſtly deſiring the
ſalvation of their children, and being ſuch who, in their minority,
were baptized likewiſe, and profeſſing a purpoſe to amend their
ways, and turn unto God, they ought not to be put back, but to be
baptized, and their parents admoniſhed how they ought to inſtruct
them and bring them up, and that they themſelves alſo ſhould <hi>bring
forth fruits meet for repentance,</hi> as the Covenant of God made
with them in Baptiſm in their minority requireth of them, if they
will not be accounted Coveant-breakers both with God and man;
and ſo their charge lyeth even at their own doors, and the Miniſter
is clear, and the Church ſatisfied, if it be ſerious and in publike, &amp;c,
for all outward Ordinances ought to be adminiſtred according
to the judgment of <hi>Charity,</hi> and ought not to be reſtrained to the
judgment of <hi>Certainty,</hi> but according to <hi>Love</hi> or <hi>Charity,</hi> the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
whereof are not to <hi>think evil,</hi> but to <hi>beleeve all things, hope
all things,</hi> and to <hi>take all things in the better part,</hi> and not to <hi>judg</hi>
or <hi>cenſure according to the appearance, but righteous judgment,</hi>
and as we can <hi>make it manifeſt</hi> that we ought ſo to <hi>judg.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. And ſecondly, in like manner for <hi>Administration</hi> of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Sacrament of the Lords Supper, it is only needful that ſuch who
would be admitted to partake of it, ſhould in the publike Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
make open profeſſion of the <hi>true Chriſtian Faith,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of, and repentance for their ſins, with a reſolution to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
and forſake them, and <hi>to walk worthy of that vocation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
they are called of God,</hi> and of ſuch <hi>communion and fellowſhip
with the Church of God</hi> whereto they are admitted. Provided al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways,
that they be admoniſhed beforehand of the danger and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that they are liable unto (if they either for the preſent ſhal deal
hypocritically with the Church of God in ſuch publike profeſſion, &amp;
do but <hi>lye</hi> and diſſemble before God &amp; men) as did but juſtly befall
<hi>Ananias and Sapphirah:</hi> And likewiſe of the judgment and cenſure
that the Church is bound publikly to denounce &amp; pronounce againſt
them in ſuſpending them again from ſuch communion; if they turn
again with the dog to his vomit, and with the ſow that was waſhed
to her wallowing in the mire, and will not be reclaimed by gentle
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:97084:49"/>
means to forſake their ſins, and ſo the fault ſhall lie at their own
doors, if they do diſſemble, or turn again; and both the Miniſter and
the Church is guiltleſs herein before God and men, for they cannot
juſtly deny them the Ordinance, though they have ſinned notoriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
if they freely confeſs ſuch their notorious ſins, and profeſs repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
and a full purpoſe of amendment of life, and that they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
that God hath pardoned, and doth and will accept them in
Jeſus Chriſt, and ſave their ſouls.</p>
            <p>For what know the Miniſters, or the whole Church, but that they
are converted, and truned unto God with all their hearts, if they ſo
profeſs? And upon what grounds can they lawfully deny to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
the ſame unto any ſuch, though their ſins aforetime have been
as <hi>ſcarlet or crimſon dye</hi> in the ſight of men?</p>
            <p>And who knoweth but ſuch publike engagement may oblige
them in conſcience for future time, and for fear of the judgment of
God againſt them, to keep their Covenant, &amp; amend their lives, and
turn unto God, and cleave unto him even with all their hearts, and
find mercy with him; whereas on the contrary, if they ſhould be
rejected, or deferred and rebuked, and not accepted and beleeved,
when they ſo profeſs, they ſhould do as much as in them lyeth, even
to <hi>deſtroy their weak faith,</hi> and <hi>to quench the ſparkles of their
ſmoaking flax,</hi> and <hi>break in peeces ſuch broken reeds,</hi> whom, for
ought we know, God hath freely accepted and received unto mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and <hi>for whom Chriſt hath dyed,</hi> and ordained ſuch Ordinances
to encreaſe and ſtrengthen their <hi>feeble faith,</hi> as well as for the ſtrong
and moſt faithful Members of the Church of God: For who
would have thought that Chriſt ſhould have called <hi>Zachous, the
Publican, and dined with him,</hi> rather then any of the faithful and
godly people of the Jews at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> who doubtleſs beleeved as
well as he, <hi>and to have eaten and drunken with Publicans and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners?</hi>
But he gives the Reaſon, <hi>For he came not to call the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
but ſinners to repentance,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But it will be objected, 1. That theſe are novel Diſtinctions and
Diviſions, that ſome ſhould be admitted to have their children bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,
and neither of the parents admitted as yet to the Sacrament
of the Lords Supper.</p>
            <p>2. And again ſecondly, That ſome ſhould be admitted to the
Sacrament of the Lords Supper, and yet not be admitted to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated
Members of that particular Church, nor have votes in
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:97084:49"/>
Elections, and admiſſions or ejections, and cenſures, &amp;c. as the
members have; this is novel and ſtrange.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, That it is no more novel, then the ſacred Scripture
and primitive Examples, as I nothing doubt, but to make it
manifeſt; and that theſe diſtinctions and diviſions are of abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
neceſſity in a Church rightly conſtituted, and governed, and
diſciplined; and the Ordinances of God rightly adminiſtred,
both to the weak and ſtrong, as they ought to be.</p>
            <p>1. And firſt then, I ſhall endeavor to make it good, that the
children of ſuch have been baptized by the Apoſtles themſelves,
upon bare profeſſion of <hi>Historical Faith,</hi> without either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of their ſins, or profeſſion of their Repentance, and a
reſolution of amendment of life, that we read of in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>And in my apprehenſion, this is either clear form the Baptiſm
of the <hi>Iaylors</hi> houſhold, and from the ordinary <hi>Tender</hi> of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm
to the whole houſholds of all that profeſſed bare Hiſtorical
Faith, to wit, That Jeſus Chriſt is the Son of God; or elſe our
grounds are to ſeek for the Baptiſm of Infants, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 15, 31,
to 34. and <hi>Acts</hi> 8 37.</p>
            <p>And if they be ſuch parents, who have been baptized in their
minority, their childrens caſe is no other, but in equal reſpect
with the Grand children of ſuch parents whoſe Grand-fathers
are holy, but their own parents profane, who yet ordinarily are
accounted admitable.</p>
            <p>2. And ſecondly, concerning admittance of all to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Lord Supper, that do deſire admittance, and will in
the publique Congregation profeſs a true juſtifying, and lively
Faith in Jeſus Chriſt; and if their ſins have been notorious, do
freely confeſs them, and profeſs Repentance, and a reſolution of
amendment of life:</p>
            <p>I cannot ſee how any Church can deny to admit them, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they have been in former times; but that they ought to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter
the outward Ordinance upon that ground, without any
further tryal or examination; and ought not to defer the
acceptance of them, with all brotherly love, and kinde reſpects,
as dear brethren; for ſo in the judgment of <hi>Charity</hi> (ſeeing they
cannot know the contrary of <hi>certainty)</hi> they ought to judg, as
hath been ſaid before: And there was never more required of
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:97084:50"/>
any in the primitive times, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 14. <hi>&amp; Chap.</hi> 13. <hi>&amp;


Chap.</hi> 10. 32, 33. <hi>&amp;Acts</hi> 2. 41, 42. I ſhall therefore engage any
that oppoſe this doctrine, to ſhew a Scriptural example on the
one hand, as there is many on the other.</p>
            <p>3. But thirdly, That all theſe ſhould, at their firſt admiſſion to
the outward Ordinances, <hi>being but babes in Chriſt,</hi> be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
admitted as viſible Saints, and members of a viſible Church,
and ſhould ſo be approved of by ſuch a Church and every member
thereof, and incorporated with them politically to have power
and vote in Elections, &amp;c. (in my apprehenſion) were very ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd.</p>
            <p>1. For, firſt, till their ſanctification be viſible indeed unto
ſuch a Church, how can they approve them as viſible Saints?
this were deeply to engage the members of the Church to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble
their judgments, which is not lawful, for they muſt <hi>lay
aſide all guile and diſſimulation,</hi> as well as all <hi>uncharitableneſs,</hi> in
<hi>judging of one another,</hi> as 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 1.</p>
            <p>2. And ſecondly, They ought not to make any judgment at
all, but leave it to God, whether they ſtand or fall to their own
maſters; but in caſes of certainty, in which they have good
ground for a full perſwaſion this way or that way, leſt by any
means, they ſhould wrong their brethren, or the Church of
God; for they ſhould ſometimes <hi>quench the ſmoking flax, and
break alſo the bruiſed reed;</hi> and ſometime again diſparage and
diſgrace the judgment of the Church by approving ſuch as do
but deal hypocritically.</p>
            <p>3. And thirdly, This were as much as if the <hi>Levites</hi> ſhould all
have been admited to <hi>attend on the ſervice of the Tabernacle of the
Congregation from their very childhood,</hi> as well as after that they
were come to years of diſcretion: for the caſe is juſtly paralel,
as theſe Scriptures will prove, <hi>Levit.</hi> 8. 18, 19. 24, 25. and 1 <hi>Pet.</hi>
2. 5, 9. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 6.</p>
            <p>Reaſ. <hi>For thus I compare them, All the</hi> Elect <hi>that are</hi> built
upon Chriſt by a lively faith, are lively ſtones built up a ſpiritual
houſe, an holy Prieſthood, to offer up ſpiritual ſacrifice, acceptable
to God by Jeſus Chriſt, 1 Pet. 2. 5. &amp; Chap. 1. 2.</p>
            <p>So that all Beleevers are accounted as <hi>Prieſts,</hi> even form their
firſt ingrafting into Chriſt by Faith.</p>
            <p>But as there was <hi>Prieſts</hi> of divers Orders; ſo alſo ought the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:97084:50"/>
true Beleevers to be diſtinguiſhed; I compare therefore the newly
converted to the Levites in their minority, till they came to years;
and all the grown <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that are experienced in the trade and
practiſe of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> to the <hi>Levites,</hi> when they came to years of
diſcretion: And all the Elders and Officers, elected by the Church,
I compare to the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> the ſons of <hi>Aaron;</hi> and ſo the <hi>Miniſters</hi>
to <hi>Aaron</hi> himſelf; and who knoweth but that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt
will govern his Church after theſe examples paralel hereto, ſeeing
the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> doth thus compare them as reſembling the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood?
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 5, 9. <hi>&amp; Chap.</hi> 1. 2. as hath been ſaid before.</p>
            <p>4. And fourthly, This double Reception is clear alſo, in my appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion,
from the Apoſtles own words; <hi>Them that are weak</hi> (ſaith
he) <hi>receive, but not unto doubtful diſputations;</hi> and therefore by
conſequence <hi>not to act, or vote, or exerciſe power in doubtful E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections,
and intricate buſineſs, which, for want of underſtanding,
they are not able for, till their wits be exerciſed in ſpiritual things
to diſcern both good and evil.</hi> It is not proper to admit them, or
approve them as joynt Members of ſuch body politick, till all the reſt
of the Members be in ſome good meaſure ſatisfied, both of their
<hi>abilities ſutable, and of the ſincerity of their hearts and intentions
for the good of the ſame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But for further ſatisfaction, that theſe are no novel Diſtinctions
or Diviſions of the Church, but of ancient uſe in the policy of the
Churches in the primitive times: Conſider the words of</hi> Origen,
alledged againſt the Remonſtrant, who recites the words of <hi>Origen</hi>
to be theſe, to wit, That it was the cuſtom of the Chriſtian Teachers
firſt to examine ſuch as deſired to hear them, of whom there were
two Orders.</p>
            <p>The firſt were Catechumeni, or beginners.</p>
            <p>The other was of ſuch as were more perfect.</p>
            <p>Among whom there were ſome or dained to enquire into the life
and manners of ſuch as are admitted into the Church.</p>
            <p>That they may baniſh ſuch from the publike Aſſembly, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrate
ſcandalous acts.</p>
            <p>I ſay, Let it be conſidered, whether the policy of the Church in
thoſe times was not juſtly paralel to that which hath been ſaid, and
whether it be not alſo ſutable to the policy of ſome civil Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
who ought to be followed in all wiſe policies, that may tend
for good of a body ſpiritual, as hath been ſaid.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:97084:51"/>
               <hi>Conſider therefore whether thoſe</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> or [Beginners]

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>] that had not
ſerved out their time in a City or Corporation, <hi>and therefore had
no voyce in Election of Officers as Majors and Aldermen, and thoſe
of the Common Counce:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And ſecondly, Whether thoſe whom he ſpeaketh of, that were</hi>
more perfect, <hi>were not like</hi> Free-men of a City, who have a vote in
Election of Officers for the Government of the whole, and of a
Common-Councel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And thirdly, Whether thoſe that were</hi> choſen and ordained out
of that order, which they accounted more perfect, <hi>Whoſe office, to
which they were ordained,</hi> was to enquire into the life and manners
of the people, and to baniſh, <hi>&amp;c. were not like the</hi> Aldermen and
Common-Councel of a City, to whom all is committed?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And fourthly, Whether the</hi> Chriſtian Teachers <hi>of thoſe times
were not over all, as</hi> Majors of Cities, who are choſen by vote of all
the freemen, and of none but freemen; <hi>for Apprentices have no vote,
till their freedom be examined, and approved likewiſe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And</hi> the children of Light ought to be as wiſe in their genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as the men of this world; <hi>and the Church is compared to a
City or Corporation:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that the Paralels in every particular do hold correſpondency
both with the <hi>Levitical Prieſthood,</hi> to whom the Apoſtle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares
the <hi>Church,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And to the practiſe of the</hi> Churches in the Primitive times, <hi>is</hi>
Origen <hi>relates them,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And to the</hi> Civil Government of Bodies Corporated,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And to the</hi> Reaſon and end of all Policy Civil and Eccleſiaſtick,
<hi>to wit,</hi> the good, and benefit, and ſafety of the whole.</p>
            <p>1. As firſt, Thoſe that upon profeſſion of the true <hi>Chriſtian
Faith,</hi> and repentance for their ſins, and or a reſolution to amend
their lives, are admitted to the Sacrament of the Lords Supper;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Are juſtly paralel to all the</hi> Levites, that, during their minority,
were not admitted to attend upon the ſervice of the Tubernacte:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And they are juſtly paralel to thoſe</hi> that, in the Primitive times,
were called <hi>Cateemement</hi> or Beginners:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And they are juſtly paralel to</hi> Apprentices in a City that have
not ſerved out their time:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And they hold correſpondency</hi> with the Reaſon and End of all
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:97084:51"/>
Government and Policy, which is the good of the whole:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For as</hi> the heir, ſo long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a
ſervant, though he be lord of all, but is under Tusors and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors,
till the time appointed of the fat, her, <hi>as the Apoſtle ſaith in a caſe
not unſutable; ſo for the veny ſame reaſon, there being a childhood
and minority in</hi> [Grace] <hi>as well as</hi> [Nature,]</p>
            <p>Reaſon tells us, that it is not fit, nor good, nor ſafe, nor likely to
tend for the good of the body; that power of government, or
vote in elections ſhould be committed unto ſuch, who are not
yet capable of ſuch a buſineſs, or are doubted of, whether they
do intend the good of the whole, no more then women are to have
vote amongſt them, nor any ſpecified in theſe parallels inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in.</p>
            <p>2. And ſecondly, thoſe who are admitted, not only to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
but to be incorporated as joynt members, of a particular
Church, upon ſuch trial and approbation, as hath heerv ſaid,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And juſtly parallel to all the</hi> Levites, That being come to yeare of
diſcretion, and gravity, were admitted to attend on the ſervice of
the Tabernacle, if without blemiſh.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And they are juſtly parrallel,</hi> to thoſe in the Primitive times, that
were more perfect then the beginners.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And they are juſtly parallel,</hi> to the freemen of a Citie, who have
votes in Elections, and out of whom the Common Councel is cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen,
as their repreſentatives; and to act for them as neeed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires.</p>
            <p>3. And thirdly, the Elders choſen, by all the joynt members of
ſuch a particular Church, and ordained; &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Are juſtly parallel to</hi> the Sons of Aaron, to whom belonged the
Prieſthood, in a peculiar manner, above the reſt of the Sons of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi,
for they were anointed with the holy oyle, as well as Aaron,
<hi>Levit.</hi> 8. 30, 31. and were ordained, and conſecrated to the Prieſts
office.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And they are juſtly parallel,</hi> to thoſe that were choſen and ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the Primitive times, to look into the lives, and manners
of ſuch as were admitted into the Church, and to baniſh, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And they are juſtly parallel,</hi> to the Aldermen of a Citie or Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>And fourthly, The</hi> Miniſters of the Churches, that are
choſen by the Eldens, and all the reſt of the body, <hi>Numb.</hi> 4. 16,
17, 18, 19, 20, 27.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:97084:52"/>
               <hi>Are juſtly parallel, to</hi> Aaron the chief Prieſt, who figuratively
repreſented the Lord Jeſus Christ, and governed, and miniſtred
in his ſacred Name, and was above his Sons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And they are Iuſtly parallel,</hi> to the teachers in the Primitive
times, who were chief in government, as well as in all other mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations,
in the Name of God, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and
therefore are called Angels. <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And they are alſo parallel, the to</hi> Majors of cities; who though
they are chief in power and command, yet it is by conſent, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the agreement; both of the Aldermen, and of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Councel, who are choſen by the freemen as well as the Major,
for the agitation and tranſaction of all their buſineſſe, for the good
of all.</p>
            <p>But it will be objected on the other part, that this publique pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of faith, and repentance, and of a reſolution to amend our
lives, and to walke worthy of ſuch vocation, will be thought too
much, conſidering that many both men and women, are baſhfull,
and timorous, and unfit to ſpeak, and declare themſelves in the open
Congregation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer briefly, that they may come before hand to the
Miniſters and Elders, and ſignifie their minds and deſires unto them,
and deſire them to expreſs ſo much in publike on their behalf, to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
the Congregation of their deſires and reſolutions, and of their
repentance, and hope in theſe reſpects, and it will be ſufficient, that
they teſtifie their aſſent to what they expreſs for them, and in their
names and behalf.</p>
            <p>And how can the whole Congregation be more eaſily ſatified in
theſe reſpects, that men are cordial and ſincere in ſuch deſires, then
by doing it publikely in the open Congregation, Who may all beare
witneſs of ſuch profeſſion? and if they turn back, and live not
ſutable in ſome good meaſure, they may all joyne in their publike
cenſure, in like manner, as in their admittance.</p>
            <p>And it cannot be denyed, but that which is the duty of every
man and woman to beleeve, and do, before he approach to receive
the Sacrament; That he ought not to deny, to profeſs in publike
before all the Congregation, that are of that profeſſion, with whom
he deſires communion.</p>
            <p>And no man will deny, but that theſe enſuing duties are requiſite,
and neceſſary to be beleeved and done, before we approach to this
Ordinance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:97084:52"/>
1. Firſt, <hi>Repentance</hi> for all our ſins, with <hi>confeſſion</hi> of them, ſuch
as have been notorious and publike, if they be objected againſt us,
even in the publike congregation; with a reſoltuion to forſake
them, and amend our lives, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Faith</hi> is a neceſſary duty, before we approach to receive the
Sacrament of the Lords Supper; for without <hi>Faith</hi> we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
receive the things ſignified; we cannot eate the <hi>fleſh, and
drinke the blood of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, but by a lively
Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the outward bread and wine, being but the Sacrament or
Signe thereof, is not the thing it ſelf, that is thereby ſignified; for
the one may be eaten by <hi>dogs</hi> and <hi>ſwine,</hi> but the other cannot, but
by him onely that hath true juſtifying and ſaving <hi>Faith.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this <hi>Faith</hi> muſt at leaſt be <hi>[profeſſed,]</hi> elſe the moſt <hi>charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
judgement</hi> cannot think them prepared for this ordinance, If
they deny to <hi>profeſs it before the whole Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Love <hi>is alſo a neceſſary duty;</hi> Love unto God, and
the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. And love to our brethren, and neighbours,
and the whole Church of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For a true</hi> faith worketh by love; <hi>and he that</hi> loveth not, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not God; for God is love, and he that loveth not his brother,
abideth in death, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And therefore no man is fit to receive the Sacrament, that is not
<hi>reconciled,</hi> both to <hi>God and men, and in charity with all,</hi> as theſe
Scriptures ſhew.</p>
            <p>But it will be objected, that if all children of ſuch beleeving pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
who outwardly profeſs, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is the Son of God,</hi>
muſt be admitted to the Chriſtian baptiſm; Then, all muſt be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
without diſtinction: For all will profeſs, that they ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve,
though they be never ſo wicked and malicious enemies to the
<hi>Church of God,</hi> and even unto <hi>Chriſt himſelf;</hi> but <hi>our holy things
muſt not be given unto dogs and ſwine,</hi> Mat. 7. 6.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I anſwer. True, if they be</hi> dogs or ſwine; <hi>that is to ſay, if they
be ſuch, as</hi> bark againſt, and ſpeake evill of the waies of God, and
of his Name and Truth, or of his Miniſters, or Diſciples, and
Children, &amp;c. for righteouſneſs ſake:</p>
            <p>They may, and ought to be excluded from all ſuch priviledges,
and their children likewiſe. Or if they be <hi>deſpiſers and ſcorners
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:97084:53"/>
of ſuch holy things; turning with the dog to his vomit, and with
the ſaw that was waſhed to her wallowing in the mire;</hi> they may
be excluded, and ought ſo to be, if they can be proved apparently
to be ſuch. But as the Lord inhibited the condemning of any man,
or putting him to death <hi>under two or three witneſſes:</hi> yea, though
one witneſs, might never ſo fully aſſert and aſſure it to the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of men, yet it muſt not ſtand.</p>
            <p>Even ſo alſo, it muſt either be apparent, and clearly witneſſed.
Or it is not ſufficient to exclude their children from their outward
Ordinance; they themſelves being ſuch, who have been baptized
in their minority: for they are no other but in like condition with
grandchildren of godly parents, who are not approved as actuall
beleevers, and yet their children are admitted unto baptiſme; If
they be not ſo profane, as to account them dogs, or ſwine, &amp;c. as
hath been ſaid. If they turn not to be enemies to the Church of
God. <hi>He that is not against us, is with us,</hi> ſaith Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>But it will be objected;</hi> If the Root be not holy, how
may we expect that the branches ſhould.</p>
            <p>But the Apoſtle plainly aſſerteth it, that ſuch, whoſe parents are
both of them <hi>unbeleeving, are unclean.</hi> Now this he only mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
that they are outwardly to be accounted <hi>unclean;</hi> for he doth
not ſo judge, as if all were Reprobates, that are borne of ſuch pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
but that they are not to be admitted, as the children of the
Church, to the outward priviledges, till their hearts be purified
through faith in God, when they come to years: and therefore
this Doctrine, is quite contrary to the Apoſtles aſſertion.</p>
            <p>I anſwer briefly, That I liſt not to be contentious in this matter;
for in this caſe, as no man ought to be <hi>compell'd</hi> to bring <hi>his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
unto Chriſtian Baptiſme;</hi> ſo no man ought to be <hi>compell'd</hi>
to <hi>Baptize any;</hi> but to doe in theſe things, as their charitable judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
ſhall engage them in conſcience of their duty unto God, and
to their Chriſtian neighbours, and to the Church, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>For there is ſtrong arguments on both ſides, the quinteſſence
whereof, I ſhall briefly propoſe on both parties, and leave them
to their conſciences, to engage them to either, as they think beſt:</p>
            <p>And firſt then, for anſwer to this precedent Objection, I do
confeſſe that this argument were unanſwerable, if it were certain
that the Apoſtle ſpak it, of ſuch <hi>beleevers,</hi> as have true viſible, ſaving,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:97084:53"/>
and juſtifying <hi>faith:</hi> and that ſuch as they can likewiſe demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
for ſatisfying of the Church that they are ſuch beleevers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But if the Apoſtle only mean it, of ſuch a faith, as upon profeſſion
whereof, the</hi> Ennuch <hi>was admitted; to wit,</hi> a beleeving that
Jeſus Chriſt is the Son of God. <hi>And that</hi> there is no name
given under heaven, by which we can be ſaved, but the name of
Jeſus Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If ſuch as theſe, I ſay, be</hi> the beleevers, <hi>intended by the Holy
Ghoſt in this place, then we remain ſtill, in the ſame dubitations
as we were before. And ſo all that profeſs; yea, or do but</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs,
that Jeſus Christ is the Son of God, muſt be accounted in
the judgement of charity, as born of God, <hi>becauſe that</hi> Fleſh and
bloud could never have revealed ſo much unto them, <hi>as</hi> 1 John
4. 2. <hi>as Chriſt ſaid unto</hi> Peter.</p>
            <p>Provided always, that ſuch their <hi>Profeſſion be ſerious and cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,</hi>
at the leaſt, outwardly.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>But it will be objected, That</hi> Abraham recived the
ſigne of circumciſion a ſeal of the righteouſneſs of Faith, which
he had when he was uncircumciſed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 11.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conſeq.</hi> Therefore it followes, That <hi>their Seal of the now Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venart,
to wit, Baptiſme,</hi> ſhould not be adminiſtred unto any
but ſuch, or to their ſeed, that have <hi>faith before, as Abraham had,
to ſet this ſeal to.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, That this Argument migh likewiſe hold the
better; If the <hi>Faith</hi> here ſpoken off, <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. were <hi>beleeving in
God, to juſtification.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it is but as the other before ſpoken off: It is but ſaid; <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham
beleeved God, and it was imputed to him for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
Now <hi>beleeving God,</hi> that what ever he promiſeth ſhall
come to paſſe. And <hi>beleeving in God unto juſtification,</hi> are far dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent;
for the <hi>Devils</hi> had the firſt but only the <hi>Elect</hi> do attain to
the ſecond.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For even</hi> Abraham himſelf, as the Apoſtle ſaith, was juſtified
declaratively by works, and not by faith onely; <hi>Namely,</hi> when he
had offered his Sonne upon the Altar, <hi>James</hi> 2. 19, 20, 21, 22,
23, 24.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conſeq.</hi> Therefore it follows, that this <hi>faith</hi> alſo, though <hi>it was
imputed unto him for righteouſneſs,</hi> and ſhall alſo be imputed to
all that ſo beleeve God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:97084:54"/>
Yet it is of it ſelf but a bare hiſtorical, and only an outward hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical
profeſſion in the ſight of men, and it is no more but ſuch as the
devils have, and therefore tremble; but it is not ſaving and juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
faith, till men can apply the promiſes of God, through Jeſus
Chriſt, peculiarly to themſelves, as to beleeve that God is <hi>[their
God,]</hi> and that Chriſt is <hi>[their Saviour,]</hi> which many of the
Elect can hardly attain to till their death beds, their faith is ſo weak;
but we muſt not <hi>deſtroy their weak faith, for whom Chriſt dyed;</hi>
we muſt not <hi>quench any ſmoaking flax, nor break aſunder the bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
reeds, nor turn aſide that which yet halteth out of the way; but
it ſhould rather be healed, or bound up, or blown, and kindled by all
ſuch Ordinances, as might incourage them</hi> to hold on, or that
might <hi>ſtrengthen their faith,</hi> for they ought to be dealt with as
<hi>[children,]</hi> by ſuch doctrines and principles as are accounted <hi>the
firſt principles of the Oracles of God,</hi> becauſe they <hi>have need of
milk,</hi> more then of <hi>ſtrong meat;</hi> and what is Baptiſm, but one of
the firſt Principles? as <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 12, 13, 14. &amp; <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. 1, 2. Yea, Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm
is ſuch an Ordinance as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> aſſerteth plainly, That
he <hi>was not ſent to baptize, but to preach the Gospel;</hi> accounting
Baptiſm a more inferior Ordinance then preaching of the Word,
though they ſometimes miniſter it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For the Miniſtry of the Word is a more ſpiritual Ordiance
and Miniſtration, for it is</hi> not Baptiſm that now ſaveth us, <hi>to wit,</hi>
not the putting away of the filth of the fleſh, <hi>(which is but the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
ſign)</hi> but the anſwer of a good conſcience, <hi>when</hi> our hearts are
purified through faith by the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>And the Word is called, <hi>the Word of Faith which the Apoſtles
preached,</hi> and they did attend more conſtantly on the Word, and
commanded others to adminiſter Baptiſm that were of leſs eſteem
for the Miniſtry of the Word, that they might not be hindred nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by that, nor by <hi>ſerving of tables,</hi> from that ſpiritual Ordinance
for the ſaving of ſouls.</p>
            <p>And it is plain from <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptists</hi> Confeſſion, that even his
<hi>Baptiſm</hi> was far inferior to that of <hi>Chriſts by his holy Spirit;</hi> and
it is plainly ſaid, that <hi>there went out unto him Jeruſalem, and all
Judea, and all the region round about Jordan, confeſſing their ſins;</hi>
yea, ſuch whom he accounted <hi>generations of vipens</hi> were likewiſe
<hi>baptized of him;</hi> for by a continued diſcourſe by way of admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
he ſpeaketh (even to them) ſaying, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 11. <hi>indeed baptize</hi>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:97084:54"/>
[you] with water to repentance, &amp;c. I Mat. 3. 5, 6, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But it may be objected, That even</hi> John the Baptiſt <hi>propheſied
of</hi> Chriſt, <hi>that</hi> he ſhould baptize them with the Holy Ghoſt, and
with fire, <hi>and ſo he alſo did within</hi> a few days after his aſcenſion;
<hi>and that his</hi> fan is in his hand, and that he will throughly purge his
floor, and gather his wheat into his garner, but will burn up the
chaff with unquenchable fire, <hi>as</hi> Verſ. 12. <hi>And therefore it follows,
that though</hi> John <hi>admitted all that came in a promiſcuous manner,
yet Chriſt will</hi> purge more throughly, and blow away the chaff,
<hi>when he hath</hi> gathered his wheat; <hi>and therefore it appears, that it
is his mind that</hi> his floor ſhould be throughly purged, and all his
wheat garner'd.</p>
            <p>I anſwer true, but heed muſt be taken, that none of the <hi>wheat
be loſt;</hi> it were better to retain <hi>the chaff and all,</hi> then loſe any
<hi>wheat;</hi> and there is ſometimes <hi>wheat</hi> ſo clothed <hi>with the chaff,</hi>
that it cannot be unclothed by the threſhing inſtrument, but it will
appear like the other <hi>chaff;</hi> and again, there is ſome other <hi>chaff</hi>
that is ſo like <hi>wheat,</hi> that you can hardly diſcern it, till you know it
by the weight; and ſo it is likewiſe with men not infallibly guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
they cannot diſcern to judg at all by the Rule of <hi>Certainty,</hi> and
therefore of neceſſity they muſt only judg by the Rule of <hi>Charity;
Till the Lord himſelf ſhall come, and ſit as a Refiner and Purifier
of ſiver,</hi> and <hi>ſhall reſtore all things,</hi> as <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 3. &amp; <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. 5. 6.
I mean, in Spirit, firſt, <hi>to reſtore all things before that great and
fearful Day of the Lord, for every mans work ſhall be tryed by
fire,</hi> to wit, [the fire of <hi>his Spirit,] of what ſort it is; and this
Day of the Lord is near at hand;</hi> the <hi>fire</hi> is a little already kindled,
and the light thereof doth a little ſhine, but our groſs combuſtibles
are long in kindling, and there is much water caſt upon them by
ſuch who ſhould blow them to make them <hi>flame,</hi> yet ſuch waters
ſhall be dryed up to their prejudice <hi>and loſs, though they may be
ſaved themſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>It will be objected, That the promiſe runs both</hi> to Abraham and
his ſeed, <hi>and therefore</hi> the ſeal of Circumciſion muſt needs <hi>be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed</hi>
to all Abrahams ſeed <hi>in their generations,</hi> till the coming of
Chriſt, who was that peculiar Seed, in which all Nations, yea all
families of the earth ſhould be bleſſed: <hi>But now the promiſe, and
ſo the Covenant runs, but</hi> to them and their ſeed that are of the
faith of Abraham, who, <hi>in that reſpect,</hi> is the father of us all; they
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:97084:55"/>
that are of faith, the ſame are the children of Abraham; <hi>but not
the other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argu.</hi> But wicked men that have lived all their life long where
the Goſpel hath been preached, and yet live not only as <hi>Infidels,</hi> but
rather like <hi>Athiſts:</hi> How is the Promiſe and Covenant properly
ſealed unto them, or to their ſeed, ſave only ſo many of them <hi>as the
Lord our God ſhall call?</hi> How ſhall it ſo, ſo much as ſeem <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>,
to apply it to their children, eſpecially conſidering they do it but of
cuſtom, more then conſcience, when they bring their children? And
this cuſtom was, it may be, chiefly incur'd by the Laws and Canons
of the Church formerly in uſe, to which impulſive means was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned;
ſo that if they had not brought them, they might, for ought
they knew, have been excommunicate both out of Church and
Markets, for ſo far the Excommunications, after Aggravations, were
extended; and how then ſhall we know their deſires to have them
baptized now are ſo much as cordial, much leſs can it be known
that they are ſo much as meer hiſtorical <hi>Believers,</hi> that continue
ſo obſtinately prophane after ſo much preaching, which they have
long heard, and the Goſpel read, which all that <hi>were ordined to
eternal life, believed</hi> at the firſt preaching of it in the primitive
times, and how then ſhall we ſo much as think that they <hi>believe the
Scripture,</hi> or any ſuch thing, as <hi>ſalvation in Chriſt,</hi> either temporal
or eternal?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> I anſwer, What know we but their children are elected,
and are of thoſe to which God will ſhew mercy: What know we,
but ſome of their Predeceſſors were ſuch <hi>as loved God,</hi> and <hi>kept his
Commandments,</hi> and therefore the Promiſe of ſhewing mercy <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thouſands in them that ſo do</hi> is ground of hopes unto them,
<hi>Exod.</hi> 20.</p>
            <p>And beſides, the Promiſe runs but to the children of <hi>Believers,
that are of Faith,</hi> for thoſe only <hi>are the children of Abraham;</hi> and
then it will neceſſarily follow, that ſo many of thoſe children of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers</hi>
that prove not <hi>Believers,</hi> but prophane, muſt not have
their children baptized, no more then the other, till they come to
years, and do deſire it themſelves being <hi>Believers</hi> alſo, which will
condemn ſome Independents practiſe, and enforce them to yield,
either to the one or the other; or at leaſt wiſe, that if ſuch as bring
their children to be baptized, can but prove that any of their Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors,
even to a thouſand generations, have <hi>loved God, and kept his
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:97084:55"/>
Commandments,</hi> they muſt bantize them, as well as ſuch children of
prophane parents, that were both born, and educated under faithful
Parents: for their profanneſs is ſo much the more groſs, and obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
and incorrigible, by how much better means, and cauſe they
have had of amendment of life; And therefore grant the one, and
you loſe the other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But it will be objected, that all that were baptized in
the Primitive times, as <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 41. were admitted likewiſe unto all
Ordinances, if at years of diſcretion, as <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 41, 42. it is ſaid, that
<hi>They that were baptized,</hi> as verſ. 41. <hi>continued ſtedfaſtly in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
doctrine and fellowſhip; and in breaking of bread, and in
prayers,</hi> as verſ. 42, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conſeq.</hi> Now then it will neceſſarily follow, that none were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
unto <hi>baptiſme</hi> but that were likewiſe <hi>admittable</hi> unto all
<hi>Ordinances, if at years of diſcretion,</hi> and therefore none ought
now to have their children <hi>baptized,</hi> but that are <hi>admitted one or
both parents to the Sacament of the Supper.</hi> Conſidering both
Ordinances are alike ſacred, as appeares from theſe Primitive ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> I anſwer, true; and ſo we ought to account them, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of adminiſtring them to any at years of diſcretion. And as for
the childen of ſuch; If you grant the one, the other is confeſſed.</p>
            <p>But the difference ſtill doth hold, as before, whether men ſhould be
admitted, and their children likewiſe, upon <hi>profeſſion of faith meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hiſtorical, or upon the holding forth of juſtifying faith, as viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
beleever</hi> Concerning which, I am of opinion as is before ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but deſire that both parties, might in this reſpect, without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
or hart-burnings each unto others, walk in love, and by the
Rule of Charity, without judging or cenſuring each other, as every
man thinketh, and is <hi>fully perſwaded in his own heart,</hi> as <hi>before
God,</hi> and not as following men though never ſo eminent in other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects;
for they are not infallible. And this is certain, that we read
not in Scripture, of any at all, that deſired <hi>baptiſme that were put put
back;</hi> And it is not ſafe to act on principles, that are not grounded
there; but on the other part, <hi>all that gladly received the Word,</hi>
without any more <hi>trial,</hi> even <hi>three thouſand ſouls were added to
the Church in one day,</hi> Act. 41. they had no time for any great trial
of ſo many.</p>
            <p>But the the arguments being ſo ſtrong on both ſides, eſpecially
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:97084:56"/>
concerning <hi>baptiſme,</hi> ſo that many godly and grave Divines, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
men, are fully perſwaded in their very ſouls and conſciences, that
they ought to doe the quite contrary one to the other in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect.</p>
            <p>It therefore followes, that neither of them ought to <hi>compel</hi> each
other to their own principles nor ways herein, neither ought the
Magiſtate to <hi>authorize</hi> the one againſt the other, but leave them
both at liberty in theſe reſpects, to be ſtricter or remiſſer, as they
think they ought; ſeeing a <hi>full,</hi> and <hi>clear,</hi> and <hi>ſatisfactory reſult,</hi>
cannot eaſily be <hi>produced from ſacred Scripture,</hi> to which all muſt
neceſſarily aſſent unto. For to <hi>Impel</hi> unto either, by Civil power, were
manifeſt <hi>tyranny</hi> over the very conſciences of the one, or the other;
and therefore ought not to be done; but as they tender the wrath
and diſpleaſure of God, and will expect his judgement who having
begun, will alſo make an end, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 41, to 44. <hi>&amp;</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 12,
13, 14, <hi>&amp; Pſ.</hi> 2. If ſuch be of the ſeed of the Jews (ſpiritual Jews
I mean) See <hi>Eſter</hi> 6. 13. <hi>for he is not a Jew that is one outward,</hi> as
<hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 28, 29.</p>
            <p>I have more particulars to propoſe betwixt them, tending to u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
concerning other points wherein they are at variance, which I
could not conveniently include in one volumne; as the caſe ſtands
with me at this time: But I purpoſe (God willing) with all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
ſpeed, to put them forth; propoſing them as (in my apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion)
an infallible reſult from ſacred Scriptures, clearly deduced;
by unanſwerable arguments.</p>
            <p>1. What kind of Civil Government was commended to the
Jews, by the Lord himſelf, as the beſt form, or way of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for them to eſtabliſh in their Common-wealth, of all other,
who were his peculiarly beloved people above all the Nations under
heaven.</p>
            <p>2. How far forth the Magiſtrate ought to compel by force
and power, to the keeping of the Law; to wit, the <hi>Moral Law</hi> of
God. And how far forth it is not lawful to uſe any force in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect.</p>
            <p>3. What is the beſt Rule to obſerve, and uſe, and the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and warrantable, to aſſure an honourable, and liberal mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
to all Godly and faithful Miniſters of the Goſpel of Chriſt.</p>
