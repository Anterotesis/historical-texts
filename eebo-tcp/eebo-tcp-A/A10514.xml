            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:16136:13"/>
and so tempt God in the foolish hazard of their life. They say their dayes are numbred; so were <hi>Sauls</hi> &amp; <hi>Iudas</hi> dayes, yet they were guilty of murder: and if not to saue, be to kill, what are they lesse who obstinately refuse proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble meanes of recouerie?

            </list>
            <p>First, if none should faile, too many would ascribe their health to the creature.</p>
            <p>Secondly, God reserueth some Cures, in which he will more immediatly discouer his owne hand: there were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Widowes in Israel in the dayes of <hi>Elisha, but onely vnto one was the Prophet sent;</hi> many lepers in Assyria, but <hi>Naa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> only healed; many here sicke, and of diuers diseases,<note place="margin">Chrysost. to. 3. hom. 35.</note> but this one cured by Christ; God seeth good to shew his presence in few.</p>

            <p>For these and the like causes, God giueth not the like effect to all; yet that exempteth none from the lawfull vse of his Ordinance: he heareth not all, yet all must pray; the Word profiteth not all, yet all must heare; God is displeased, if the meanes he hath prescribed be neglected: albeit by the powerfull effects of his hidden iudgements he teach vs to distinguish betwixt the first cause and the second; that to be trusted to, this to be vsed.
