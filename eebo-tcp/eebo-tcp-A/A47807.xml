         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                                       <p>His Majesty has Considered with himself, that 'tis not enough that your Religion and Liberty is secure during his own Reign, but he thinks he owes it to his People to do all that in Him lies, that these Blessings may be transmitted to your Posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and so well secured to them, that no Successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in After-ages may be able to work the least Alteration.</p>
                                       <p>And therefore His Majesty, who hath often said in This place, that He is ready to consent to any Laws of this Kind, so that the same extend not to Alter the Descent of the Crown in the Right Line, nor to defeat the Succession, hath now Commanded this to be further Explained.</p>
                                       <p>

                                          <pb n="86" facs="tcp:57297:48"/>And to the end it may never be in the power of any Papist, if the Crown descend upon him, to make any Change either in Church or State; I am Commanded to tell you, that his Majesty is willing, that Provision may be made first, to distinguish a Papist from a Protestant Successor; then so to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, and circumscribe the Authority of a Popish Successor in these Cases following, that he may be disabled to do any harm.</p>
                                       <p>First, In reference to the Church, His Majesty is content, that care be taken, that all Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and Spiritual Benefices and Promotions in Gifts of the Crown, may be conferred in such a manner, that we may be sure the Incumbents shall always be of the most Pious and Learned Protestants: And that no Popish Successour (while he continue so) may have any power to Controul such Presentments.</p>
                                       <p>In reference to the State, and Civil part of the Government, as it is already provided, that no Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist can Sit in either House of Parliament; So the King is pleased, that it be provided too, That there may never want a Parliament when the King shall happen to Dye: But that the Parliament then in Being, may continue Indissolvable for a competent time; Or, if there be no Parliament in being, then the last Parliament, which was in being before that time, may Re-Assemble, and Sit a competent time, without any New Summons or Election.</p>
                                       <p>And as no Papist can by Law hold any place of Trust, so the King is content, that it may be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Provided, That no Lords, or other of the Privy Council, no Iudges of the Common Law, or



<pb n="87" facs="tcp:57297:48"/>
in Chancery, shall at any time during the Reign of any Popish Successor, be put in, or displaced, but by the Authority of Parliament.</p>
                                       <p>And that care also be taken, that none but sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Protestants may be Iustices of the Peace.</p>
                                       <p>In Reference to the Military part, the King is willing, That no Lord-Lieutenant, or Deputy-Lieutenant, nor no Officer in the Navy (during the Reign of any Popish Successor) be put out or removed, but either by Authority of Parliament, or of such Persons as the Parliament shall intrust with such Authority.</p>
                                       <p>'Tis hard to invent another Restraint to be put upon a Popish Successor, considering how much the Revenue of the Successor will depend upon consent of Parliament, and how impossible it is to raise Money without such Consent. But yet, if any thing can else occur to the Wisdom of the Parliament, which may further secure Religion and Liberty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst a Popish Successor, without defeating the Right of Succession it self, His Majesty will most readily Consent to it.</p>
                                       <p>Thus Watchfull is the King for all your safety, and if he could think of any thing else, that you do ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther want, or wish, to make you happy, he would make it his Business to effect it for you.</p>
                                       <p>God Almighty Long continue this Blessed Vnion, between the King and his Parliament, and People.</p>

                     <p>IN the Handling of this Text, there are <hi>Two General Points,</hi> that I have still laid the Main Stress of all my Discourses, and Thoughts upon: <hi>First,</hi> That the very Story of the <hi>Popish Design</hi> upon the <hi>Kings Person, Crown</hi> and <hi>Dignity,</hi> was an <hi>Imposture</hi> in the <hi>Original Conception</hi> of it.

                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the very <hi>Same</hi> Treasonous Design, was <hi>Couch'd,</hi> and <hi>Carry'd-on,</hi> by <hi>Another Party,</hi> in <hi>Truth,</hi> and in <hi>Earnest,</hi> Under the <hi>Cover</hi> of <hi>That,</hi> in <hi>Common <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>There are allso Certain</hi> Letters; (he says) Five <hi>in</hi> Number, <hi>which are All Directed to</hi> Mr. Bedingfield <hi>at</hi> Windsor; One <hi>of them Subscribed</hi> Nich.

(<hi>by which is conceiv'd to be meant</hi> Grove <hi>and</hi> Pickering; <hi>who, as</hi> Otes <hi>hath before Deposed, had Vndertaken to</hi> Assassinate <hi>his</hi> Majesty) <hi>to put on strong Resolutions; And that if the Business hit not at</hi> Windsor, <hi>to be ready to attend</hi> 48. <hi>which, as</hi> Mr. Otes <hi>before Deposeth, signifieth</hi> the KING.]</p>
                     <p>It further saith, that [<hi>Ours here are very Devout, that after so long Patience they may Enjoy</hi> Catholique Religion <hi>in a way more Publique then now they do: Certainly we can never fail, since we have so many Strings to our Bow.</hi> 48 <hi>is secure, and All our Party very Faithful.</hi>]</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The</hi> Other Four <hi>were all enclos'd in</hi> One Cover; <hi>The</hi> First <hi>whereof, subscribed</hi> John Fenwick, <hi>and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perscribed</hi> For Mr Bedingfield at Windsor. <hi>Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to the</hi> Post-Master <hi>there, 'till he should Call for it.

                        <hi>These Letters, if they can be so Prov'd, as to be Believ'd to be the Hands of the several Persons by whom they are said to be Written; do fully make out the Guilt of the Writers, and do much Confirm all the rest that hath been Deposed by</hi> Mr. Otes.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Otes <hi>hath Deposed them to be the Hands of the Persons whose Names are subscribed; and being shew'd the Letters, was able, upon the sight of some Few Lines of them, Hiding the Name, to say whose Letter Each was; which, the Name being Discover'd, prov'd to fall out accordingly; and This he did rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, and without Hesitation. And farther he said, that though the</hi> Spelling <hi>of</hi> Mr. Bedingfields Name, <hi>and of the</hi> Writers Names, <hi>do not agree with the</hi> Right Spelling, <hi>that it is an Vsual Art of the</hi> Jesuits, <hi>purposely to Commit such Faults to</hi> Disguise <hi>themselves if the Letters should be found: And further, that though the Hands Themselves do not agree with what they do at other times write, yet That is purposely done to

Prevent Discovery, and that he is well acquainted with These their assumed</hi> Hands; <hi>and knows the way of writing, not only of These, but of about Eighty of the said Society.</hi>

                           <p>The Earl went from <hi>Windsor</hi> to his House at <hi>Wim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleton,</hi> directing, that if the Dr. had any thing more to say unto him of That Matter, he should come to him thither, or send away That Gentleman the Earl had left to stay with him, to see the Men, and Learn their Lodgings; and to be Diligent in bringing any Intelligence which Required Haste.</p>

                           <p>Hereupon the Earl order'd this Gentleman to Observe the Drs.

Those Instruments over to serve his Purpose. The <hi>Matter,</hi> was the <hi>Traduction</hi> of <hi>Habernfelds Relation</hi>: His <hi>Instrument</hi> was <hi>Otes,</hi> and the <hi>Supplying</hi> of <hi>Otes'es Barking Necessities</hi> was a sure way for the Engaging of so <hi>Profligate</hi> a <hi>Wretch.</hi> It was not for <hi>Nothing,</hi> that he shew'd <hi>Otes,</hi> his <hi>Royal Martyr,</hi> with the Draught of <hi>Habernfelds</hi> Story in't: Or that he gave him his <hi>Lesson,</hi> and sent him <hi>Beyond Sea</hi> upon't.</p>

                     <hi>THERE will be a Time</hi> when <hi>Truth</hi> shall be <hi>Believ'd,</hi> and the <hi>Witnesses</hi> of it <hi>Iustify'd</hi>; and the <hi>World</hi> never the more upon the <hi>mending Hand, neither</hi> perhaps. For it is <hi>Matter of Course,</hi> in the <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Flux</hi> of <hi>Humane Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,</hi> for the <hi>Next</hi> Age to do That Right to the <hi>Former,</hi> which the <hi>Former</hi> could Not do to it <hi>self. 'Tis a Rare Felicity of the Times</hi> (says <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus</hi>) when the <hi>Present State of Things</hi> will <hi>bear</hi> a <hi>True History.</hi> But so it is however, that <hi>One Generation</hi> finds <hi>Argument</hi> and <hi>Entertainment</hi> for <hi>Another</hi>; And whether the <hi>Subject</hi> be <hi>Good</hi> or <hi>Bad</hi>; or the <hi>Succeeding Age, Better</hi> or <hi>Worse,</hi> Things will be never the less Agreeable in the <hi>Story,</hi> for being <hi>Execrable</hi> in the <hi>Practice.</hi> For the <hi>Popular Test</hi> of <hi>Good</hi> or <hi>Evil,</hi> is <hi>Profit,</hi> or <hi>Loss</hi>; and it is only <hi>Interest</hi> that <hi>supports</hi> the <hi>Reputation</hi> of <hi>Wickedness,</hi> and <hi>Quenches</hi> the <hi>Veneration</hi> that is due to <hi>Virtue.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>

                     <pb facs="tcp:57297:169"/>So that in saying <hi>There will be such a Time,</hi> &amp;c. and in <hi>Appealing</hi> from the <hi>Envy</hi> of the <hi>Present,</hi> to the <hi>Impartial Iustice</hi> of the <hi>Times to come,</hi> I do not take upon me to speak with the <hi>Spirit</hi> of a <hi>Prophet</hi>; (as if I <hi>Fore-told</hi> Things <hi>Hard</hi> to be <hi>Fore-known.</hi>) Neither do I reckon that I put any <hi>Complement</hi> upon <hi>Posterity,</hi> in <hi>Transmitting</hi> my <hi>Cause,</hi> and my <hi>Papers</hi> into <hi>Their Hands. My</hi> Bus'ness is only to Place <hi>Truth</hi> in a <hi>Proper Light,</hi> and to take the best Care I can, that <hi>After-times</hi> may be the <hi>Wiser</hi> for <hi>Our Follies</hi>; the <hi>Honester</hi> for our <hi>Impostures</hi>; and that the <hi>Infamy</hi> of the <hi>Present Age,</hi> may not pass for <hi>History</hi> in the <hi>Next.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Tract is Intended for a <hi>Third Part,</hi> in Continuation of what I have already Publish'd in <hi>Two Other Parts,</hi> under the Title of [<hi>A Brief History of the Times,</hi> &amp;c.] In the <hi>First</hi> Part, I have layd open the <hi>Scheme</hi> and <hi>Manage</hi> of the <hi>Late Conspiracy,</hi> upon the <hi>Credit</hi> of the <hi>Conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors Proper Acts</hi> and <hi>Records.</hi> In the <hi>Second,</hi> I have Endeavour'd to give the World a <hi>True</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the <hi>Rise, Progress,</hi> and <hi>Conduct</hi> of the <hi>Pretended Popish Plot.</hi> And to shew, not so much what it was <hi>Not,</hi> as what it <hi>Was</hi>; which will make the Story appear quite Another Thing then all this while it has been taken to be.</p>
                  <p>

                     <pb facs="tcp:57297:169"/>The <hi>Third Part</hi> that I am now entring upon, is a kind of <hi>Historical Review</hi> upon the Matters of Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey.</hi> If he was <hi>Murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> at <hi>Somerset-House,</hi> as <hi>Bedloe</hi> and <hi>Prance</hi> swear he <hi>was,</hi> the <hi>Iesuits</hi> and their <hi>Fellows</hi> are certainly the <hi>Damnedst Fools upon the Face of the Earth:</hi> But if That story was utterly <hi>Impossible</hi> to be <hi>true, the Lord open the Eyes of the Blind, and be merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the Souls of those that all this while have swallow'd All These Shams for Gospel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the sake of Good <hi>Method,</hi> I have <hi>Subdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided</hi> this <hi>Third Part</hi> into <hi>Two Other Parts,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it self. The <hi>Former</hi> Treats of the <hi>Somerset-House</hi> Invention, with the Circumstances of <hi>Time, Place, Manner, Persons</hi>; And so goes on with the <hi>Iaunt</hi> from the <hi>Stable-Rayles</hi> to <hi>Primrose-Hill; Comparing</hi> and <hi>Examining Depositions, Iournals,</hi> and <hi>Publique Entries</hi>; 'till, in the End, it appears upon <hi>Demonstration</hi> as <hi>Infallible</hi> as <hi>Truth it self,</hi> that a Man might as well take upon him to bring <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Hell</hi> to <hi>shake Hands,</hi> as to Reconcile <hi>Prance</hi> and <hi>Bedloe,</hi> One to Another; or <hi>Either</hi> of them to the Bare <hi>Possibility</hi> of a <hi>Consistence</hi> with <hi>Himself.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It follows now, in the <hi>Second</hi> Part, since Sir <hi>Edmund</hi> was <hi>Not Murther'd</hi> so and so, at <hi>Somer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set-House,</hi> in such or such a <hi>Place</hi>; by such and such <hi>Hands</hi>; or for this or that <hi>Reason,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the <hi>Witnesses Report,</hi> to Enquire <hi>How?



<pb facs="tcp:57297:170"/>
When? Where? Why?</hi> By <hi>Whom?</hi> Or, in fine, By what <hi>Disaster</hi> he was brought to his <hi>End?</hi> Upon the <hi>Whole,</hi> I have no more to say, then to desire the Reader, in the Awe of <hi>God,</hi> and of his <hi>Conscience,</hi> to <hi>Ask,</hi> and to <hi>Resolve</hi> All these fore-going Questions within Himself.</p>
                  <p>There are <hi>Three Points</hi> of very <hi>Great Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> that I have here made the Argument of <hi>These Three Treatises</hi>; of <hi>Great Importance,</hi> I say, in the <hi>Subject-matter</hi> of them; In the <hi>Credit</hi> they have found in the World: In the <hi>Countenance</hi> that has been <hi>Given</hi> them: In the Miserable <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences</hi> that they have <hi>Already</hi> brought upon the <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> of the <hi>Government,</hi> even to the <hi>Scandal</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> it self, and of the <hi>English Nation.</hi> And of <hi>Great Importance</hi> else in the <hi>Further Operation</hi> of These <hi>Impostures</hi> upon the <hi>Generations</hi> that are <hi>yet to come</hi>; in Transmitting an <hi>Everlasting Infamy</hi> upon so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Noble <hi>Families</hi> and <hi>Persons,</hi> as have been <hi>falsely Accused</hi> for this <hi>Pretended Conspiracy:</hi> And no way to Encounter the <hi>Scandal,</hi> but by taking the <hi>Masque</hi> off in <hi>Time,</hi> and bringing the <hi>Naked Truth</hi> of this <hi>Iugling History</hi> into a <hi>Clearer Light.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Such as it is, I am now about to Deliver a <hi>Third Part</hi> of it over into the World; partly upon an <hi>Impulse</hi> of <hi>Conscience</hi> and <hi>Duty</hi>; and partly as I am a Friend to <hi>Plain-Dealing</hi> and <hi>Common Iustice.</hi> But I know very well, that <hi>Good Dispositions</hi> are of Little or no <hi>Effect,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out



<pb facs="tcp:57297:170"/>
                     <hi>Necessary Powers</hi> and <hi>Authorities,</hi> for the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of them in <hi>Exercise.</hi> Upon this Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, before I ever advanc'd One Step or Syllable upon This <hi>Design,</hi> I made it my Humble Suit to his Late Blessed Majesty, that he would give me <hi>Leave</hi> and <hi>Commission,</hi> to make a <hi>Warrantable En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry</hi> into the <hi>Forgeries</hi> of <hi>Otes</hi>; and to try if I could fairly bring him to <hi>Iustice</hi> for his <hi>Perjuries.</hi> His Majesty was hereupon pleased to Grant me an <hi>Order</hi> for the <hi>Examining</hi> of <hi>Witnesses,</hi> and <hi>Comparing Evidences; and the Matter succeeded according to the Wish of every Honest Man in the Three Kingdoms.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So soon as I found that <hi>Otes</hi> was Fast in the <hi>Toyl</hi>; it was but Reason Methought, for <hi>Prance</hi> to take <hi>His Turn</hi> too: The Bus'ness of Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey</hi> being the <hi>Only Leg</hi> the <hi>Plot</hi> had now left to <hi>stand</hi> upon. Beside, that the <hi>White-Horse-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult</hi> and the <hi>Somerset-House-Murther</hi> rested upon the <hi>same Bottom:</hi> Insomuch that the <hi>Fall</hi> of the <hi>Plot</hi> Tript up the Heels of the <hi>Murther</hi>; for <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loe</hi> and <hi>Prance swearing to Both Alike</hi>; if there was <hi>No Plot,</hi> they were Consequently <hi>Forsworn</hi> to <hi>Both Alike.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In few words, All the <hi>Narratives, Depositions,</hi> and <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Otes, Bedloe,</hi> and <hi>Prance,</hi> were so tun'd One to Another, that it was <hi>Impossible</hi> to <hi>Touch Either</hi> of the <hi>Three,</hi> and the <hi>Other Two</hi> not <hi>Feel</hi> on't. I speak of their <hi>Agreement</hi> in <hi>One Common END</hi>; for they fall <hi>foul</hi> one upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, every Step they set, in the WAY to't.

                     <hi>Otes</hi> was <hi>Forsworn,</hi> so were the <hi>Other Two,</hi> by an <hi>Inseparable Complication</hi>; and <hi>Prance</hi>'s Bus'ness was <hi>more then three quarters done,</hi> in the very do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Otes</hi>'s.

                     <pb facs="tcp:57297:172"/>By a Letter from Mr. <hi>Fincham,</hi> bearing Date, <hi>Sept.</hi> 20. 1684. I understood that these Worthy Gentlemen had Examin'd <hi>Harry Moor,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their <hi>Order.</hi> And by Another from Dr. <hi>Nalson</hi> of the 22<hi>d.</hi> I received the <hi>Examination it self,</hi> with an Account from <hi>Both,</hi> how <hi>Moor</hi> stood upon his Guard; and how Dextrously he Manag'd his Point.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>We found him (<hi>says Mr.</hi> Fincham) to be very subtle and dexterous in Equivocating: His Answers for the most part, Study'd, and Labour'd; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we took a great deal of Pains with him, and used all the Arguments we could to be clear and plain, yet we could not prevail. However, he has confessed enough to confirm <hi>Mr. Wynels Enforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> and likewise owns <hi>Mrs. Gibbons</hi> coming to <hi>Sir Edmunds</hi> House on the <hi>Tuesday,</hi> and his lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her to Church after the <hi>Corps;</hi> and Declares, That he went with the <hi>Godfreys</hi> to her House on the <hi>Sunday.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He acknowledges his telling <hi>Mrs. Pamphlin,</hi> on <hi>Sunday Morning,</hi> that <hi>Sir Edmund</hi> was gone A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad Two Hours before she enquired for him; and for the Reason of it, he gives the <hi>Command</hi> of <hi>Secrecy</hi> Enjoyn'd him by <hi>Mr. Godfrey.</hi> In short, the Great Secrecy that he was all along obliged to, by the <hi>Godfreys,</hi> (for which we could not get any Reason from him, when we told him how much it had been the Interest of his <hi>Masters Brothers,</hi> and



<pb facs="tcp:57297:172"/>
all his <hi>Friends,</hi> if they had suspected he had been Murther'd by any Person, to have made the same <hi>Publique,</hi> and obtained my <hi>L. C.

                     <p>It is the Greatest Riddle <hi>(as I told him)</hi> that, as he Averrs, only <hi>He Himself,</hi> and the <hi>Two God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freys</hi> should know of <hi>Sir E.

                  <p>This Cavil about the <hi>Saturdays Post</hi> I have clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over and over, where the Subject led me to That Point; And so I have the <hi>Other</hi> Pretence of the Worlds taking no Notice of Sir <hi>E's Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting Himself</hi> till <hi>Tuesday</hi>; for they went from place to place Enquiring after him, to my Lady <hi>Prats,</hi> to Captain <hi>Gibbons</hi>; they told <hi>Parsons,</hi> and <hi>Mason</hi> as much <hi>before,</hi> and most of the Enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations Dated from <hi>the very day of his Absenting himself</hi>; it being All over the <hi>Town,</hi> upon the <hi>Sunday, What was become of</hi> Sir Edmundbury Godfrey? <hi>He went out Yesterday Morning, and did not come home Last Night.</hi>

                     <argument>
                        <p>Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey</hi> did certainly Dye a violent Death; and <hi>William Bedloe</hi> and <hi>Miles Prance</hi> took upon them to Discover the Murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, and the Murther.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THERE never was, perhaps, such a <hi>Mystery</hi> made of a <hi>Plain Case,</hi> as we have had in the Bus'ness of Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey</hi>: That is to say; Concerning the <hi>Manner</hi> of his <hi>Death</hi>; The



<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57297:184"/>
                        <hi>Time</hi>; The <hi>Place</hi>; The <hi>Occasion</hi> of it; and by what <hi>Hands</hi> He <hi>Fell</hi>: And All This only for want of Taking right Measures in the <hi>Tracing</hi> and <hi>Timing</hi> of Things. For Whoever draws <hi>Inferences,</hi> Hand-over-Head, from <hi>Bold Allegations,</hi> to <hi>Certainty of Fact</hi>; or from <hi>Positive Oaths,</hi> to the <hi>Truth</hi> of every Thing that is <hi>Sworn,</hi> without Further Enquiry, or Examination, will find himself Mightily Mistaken upon the Subject here in Issue.</p>
                     <p>To do This as it should be done, there must a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard be had to the <hi>Order,</hi> both of <hi>Time,</hi> and of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion</hi>; the <hi>Date,</hi> the <hi>Series,</hi> and the <hi>Succession</hi> of Things, <hi>Apart</hi>; with the <hi>Reasons,</hi> and <hi>Countenances</hi> of Affairs, as they stand in the <hi>Context.</hi> It will Need but a very short Deduction, to bring down the Course of This Story into the Proper Channel, by laying open the Naked <hi>Fact</hi> of Sir <hi>E. B. G</hi>'s Dying a <hi>Violent Death:</hi> By shewing <hi>Who</hi> they were that took upon them to <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect</hi> the <hi>Murtherers,</hi> and to <hi>Prove</hi> the <hi>Murther</hi>; and how <hi>Godfrey</hi>'s <hi>Name</hi> came Originally into the Story; which, as they pretended, was the Occasion of his <hi>Death.</hi> This is it that I propose for the <hi>Argument</hi> of my <hi>First Chapter,</hi> and Thence to Proceed, Step by Step, and in a Natural Method from one Point to another.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>First Question</hi> will be, <hi>Whether or No the</hi> Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>was Committed in</hi> Manner, <hi>and</hi> Form, <hi>as the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses Swear it was, at</hi> Somerset-house? The <hi>Second</hi> Point will be This. In Case it shall appear that he was <hi>Not</hi> Murther'd at <hi>Somerset-house,</hi> or by such <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi> or by such <hi>Means,</hi> or upon such a <hi>Grudge,</hi> as <hi>Prance</hi> and <hi>Bedloe</hi> swear he was; In what <hi>Place,</hi> by what <hi>Instruments,</hi> in what <hi>Way,</hi> and by what <hi>Instiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Was</hi> he Murthered? These Two Considerations shall be laid indifferently before the Reader, in a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribution of this Discourse, respectively, into <hi>Two

Parts,</hi> without Bespeaking One Partial <hi>Word</hi> or <hi>Thought</hi> upon the whole Matter.</p>
                     <p>As to the Two Witnesses that gave Testimony in This Cause, they had no more Skill in the Merits of it, then the Next Cast of <hi>Parrots</hi> in the Price of <hi>Almonds:</hi> But there was an <hi>Intrigue</hi> of <hi>State</hi> driven on, under the Cover of a <hi>Iesuitical Confederacy,</hi> which render'd it Necessary, at That Time, to make the <hi>Papists</hi> as <hi>Odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> as they could, and to lay all <hi>Iudgments</hi> and <hi>Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,</hi> as well <hi>Publique,</hi> as <hi>Private,</hi> at their Door.

                     </q>
                     <p>On the <hi>Thursday following,</hi> upon a Suggestion that there were People would come in to discover the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if it were not for the Danger of being Murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themselves in Revenge; His Majesty was graciously pleas'd, by <hi>Another Proclamation,</hi> to add an Assurance of <hi>Protection</hi> to the former Promise of <hi>Pardon,</hi> and <hi>Reward</hi>; so that here was <hi>Indemnity, Mony,</hi> and <hi>Security</hi> offered to the fairest <hi>Bidder,</hi> and it fell to the Lot of <hi>W.

                     <p>The <hi>Second Proclamation</hi> was not Eight-and-Forty-Hours-Old, when a sudden Freak took him in the Head of making a Step from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Bristol,</hi> and there was a Gentlewoman in his Company that went down to her Parents there, by the same Passage. They were no sooner come to their Inn at <hi>Newberry,</hi> but <hi>Bedloe</hi> Call'd presently for <hi>Pen, Ink, and Paper,</hi> to write, he said, to <hi>Secretary Coventry.</hi> The Woman saw the <hi>Writing, Sealing, Superscribing,</hi> and the sending away of the Letter by the Post: She Read the <hi>Superscription</hi> too, but could not get any thing from him of the <hi>Contents,</hi> more then This, <hi>That if the Business of that

Letter succeeded, he would present her with a Diamond Ring</hi> (being a small Sum of Mony in her Debt, it seems) And he said Farther, that he expected to receive an Answer of That Letter at <hi>Bristoll,</hi> which accordingly he did receive with a Letter Enclos'd to the <hi>Mayor</hi> of <hi>Bristoll</hi> in the Terms Following.</p>

Swear <hi>Positively</hi> to more then they <hi>Know.</hi> But for <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,</hi> or <hi>Not</hi> Pretended, we'll let That Pass, and come short to the First Member of this Division, that is to say, [WHY] was the <hi>Murther,</hi> &amp;c. made a <hi>Branch</hi> of the <hi>Plot</hi>?</p>
                     <p>There was at That Time, a <hi>Real Conspiracy</hi> upon the <hi>Wheel,</hi> under the <hi>Countenance</hi> of another in <hi>Vision</hi>; and the <hi>Hopes</hi> of the <hi>One,</hi> Depended entirely upon the <hi>Reputation</hi> of the <hi>Other</hi>; for the Peoples Affections are as Necessary to a <hi>Rebellion,</hi> as their <hi>Fingers</hi>; and for <hi>One</hi> Man that Heartily Espouses the <hi>Wickedness,</hi> and the <hi>Malice</hi> of a <hi>Sedition,</hi> a Body may Honestly reckon upon a <hi>Hundred,</hi> that are <hi>Trick'd</hi> into it, by a <hi>Plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Cheat</hi>: Now the Heat of <hi>Otes</hi>'s <hi>Plot</hi> was, by This Time, pretty well Cool'd, and the <hi>Republican</hi> Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices Consequently at some sort of <hi>Stand.</hi> Men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to <hi>Hearken,</hi> to <hi>Enquire,</hi> to Lay Things and Things <hi>Together,</hi> and to <hi>Examine</hi> Matters; to Carry their <hi>own Heads</hi> upon their <hi>own Shoulders</hi>: Again, to <hi>Iudge</hi> for <hi>Themselves,</hi> and to Act like <hi>Reasonable Creatures.</hi> They began, I say, to make Use of their Own <hi>Eyes,</hi> and <hi>Vnderstandings,</hi> and to Try if they could find the way <hi>Home</hi> again, without the help of a <hi>Dog and a Bell.</hi> The <hi>Supposed Conspiracy,</hi> they saw, had but One Single Testimony to support it: And <hi>That,</hi> a <hi>Blasted</hi> one too: Nay, the <hi>Narrative it self</hi> was found to be only <hi>Noise,</hi> without <hi>Proof.</hi> But in fine; what with <hi>This, That,</hi> and <hi>T'other,</hi> the <hi>Cause,</hi> (in <hi>Common Reputation</hi> at least) was ee'n giving up the <hi>Ghost</hi>; for want of <hi>Variety,</hi> as well of <hi>Matter,</hi> as of <hi>Witnesses,</hi> to keep the Life and Soul to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether on't. But at Length, through a Wonderful Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence (as Providence went Then-a-Days) both these Wants were supply'd, by <hi>Bedloe</hi> and <hi>Prance</hi>; and a <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Fraud</hi> made use of, to Prove the <hi>Truth</hi> of the <hi>Former.</hi> So it was, in fin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

not Call'd him <hi>Vp</hi> again. The Matter in Brief, was so Manag'd, that the <hi>Murther</hi> was to prove the <hi>Plot,</hi> and the <hi>Plot,</hi> to Prove the <hi>Murther:</hi> Witness the Stress that was laid upon the Matter at All Tryals, in favour of the <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>Providence</hi> of the <hi>Discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> Nay, they went so Inseparably hand in hand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that [<hi>Who Murther'd Sir Edmundbury Godfrey?</hi>] was the Common Refuge of People that were <hi>run up to the Wall,</hi> upon <hi>That Controversie.</hi> Insomuch, that it Stopp'd All Mouths, and Answered all Objections. The Pretended <hi>Conspiracy it self,</hi> as I was a-saying, had as much need of a <hi>Second,</hi> as the <hi>Witness</hi>; and when <hi>Otes</hi> and his Works came once to be <hi>Blown</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they were, in their own <hi>Defence,</hi> to find out some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else that was <hi>Horrid</hi> in <hi>Fact,</hi> to Bolster up the <hi>Reputation</hi> of the <hi>Guns, Daggers, Pilgrims</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sults,</hi> that never had any Being in the Nature of Things, further then in <hi>Imagination.</hi> And People be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to make their Observations also, that though there was <hi>Time</hi> enough allow'd before the <hi>Discovery,</hi> for the <hi>Vttermost Execution</hi> of the whole <hi>Villainy</hi>; there was not so much as an Inch of <hi>Match</hi> found; Not a Flask of <hi>Powder,</hi> or a <hi>Dark Lanthorn,</hi> toward the bringing of it to <hi>Effect</hi>: No, not so much as one Snip of a <hi>Letter,</hi> or <hi>Commission,</hi> to uphold the Credit of the <hi>Pretence</hi>; so that the <hi>Managers</hi> were exceedingly in the <hi>Right,</hi> under so many <hi>Difficulties</hi> and <hi>Disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> to cast the Weight of the <hi>Plot</hi> upon <hi>That Issue:</hi> For the Cry of a <hi>Popish Murther,</hi> and a <hi>Protestant Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,</hi> at that Time of the Day, was enough to lay the Three Kingdoms in <hi>Sackcloth and Ashes</hi>; Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially with the <hi>Pulpits, Iuries, News-Letters,</hi> and <hi>Coffee-Houses</hi> to friend. This was the Reason for That way of Proceeding, and their Expectations were not decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the Event. To Conclude; as they found it Necessary to link the <hi>Plot</hi> and the <hi>Murther</hi> together;



<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57297:188"/>
so they made it, quite throughout, the <hi>Interest</hi> of the <hi>One</hi> to <hi>Assist</hi> toward the <hi>Belief</hi> of the <hi>Other:</hi> And who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>Disputed</hi> the <hi>Murther, Affronted</hi> the <hi>Conspiracy.</hi> Now if a PLOT or NO <hi>Plot,</hi> was the Question, there needs no more to be said upon the WHY and the WHEREFORE of the Bus'ness, then that the <hi>Whole</hi> was at Stake upon <hi>This Cast.</hi> It was next to be Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, HOW, <hi>i. e.</hi> upon what <hi>Pretext,</hi> by what <hi>Means</hi> and <hi>Methods</hi> this <hi>Pretended Murther</hi> was made a <hi>Branch</hi> of the <hi>Pretended Plot.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It happen'd very Unluckily, that the <hi>Pretended Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Murther</hi> should fall upon him that took the <hi>Depositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of the <hi>Pretended Popish Plot</hi>: for it was <hi>This Accident</hi> that gave the <hi>Hint</hi> and <hi>Countenance,</hi> to the <hi>Alliance</hi> that was afterwards Contracted betwixt them.

or to Enter into a <hi>Captious Scrutiny</hi> upon the whole affair: for my business is not to Expose <hi>simple Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sights, Inadvertencies</hi> or <hi>Mistakes</hi>; No, Nor, in this Place, so much as to <hi>Cavill</hi> at the <hi>Credit,</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Witnesses,</hi> Or to Bear too hard upon the <hi>Vnlike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhood</hi> of Things <hi>Affirm'd,</hi> or <hi>Deny'd</hi>; but to lay open the Matter Nakedly as it is represented, and leave the Reader to the Liberty of his own Comment.</p>
                     <p>The Depositions here in Question, were sworn, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before the <hi>Councill,</hi> the <hi>Lords Committees,</hi> at the <hi>Bar</hi> of the <hi>Lords House,</hi> or given in Evidence at the <hi>Tryalls</hi> of the <hi>Pretended Criminals.</hi> Now to be Fair, they must hold such a Congruity, One part to Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and every Part to the Whole, as in a Charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Construction to be found All of a Piece, without any Considerable Variation of the Story, either in <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluity</hi> or <hi>Defect:</hi> which is No more then according to the very letter of the <hi>Oath</hi>; to Deliver the <hi>Truth,</hi> the <hi>Whole Truth</hi> and <hi>Nothing But the Truth:</hi> and the Matter still to be the same, in what Diversity of Phrase or Expression soever.

                     <p>Upon the 7<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> 1678. he had not so much as the least <hi>Kenning</hi> of it. The 8<hi>th.</hi> Sprung a Pretty <hi>light</hi> to't.

                        <pb n="24" facs="tcp:57297:195"/>
there was No avoiding of his Point, for he had still some New way of Attaque or Other that never was heard of before: and against which there was No Place, for either <hi>Prevention,</hi> or <hi>Defence.</hi> He swore then to the <hi>Pris'ner,</hi> rather then to the <hi>Crime,</hi> for there Needed No more then the Clapping of <hi>any Man's Name</hi> to This or That <hi>Article,</hi> or <hi>Accusation,</hi> to the doing of his Business: Though his Depositions upon the <hi>Lords Iournal,</hi> and Those in the <hi>Printed Tryalls</hi> are in Many Cases Flat <hi>East and West,</hi> One to the Other: But to proceed now from <hi>Reasoning</hi> upon Matters, to the <hi>Fact it self.</hi>

                     <p>His First appearance upon Oath, was, (as is already set forth), on the 7<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> 1678. <hi>before his Majesty and his Two Secretaries:</hi> at which time, he spake singly to the <hi>Murther,</hi> Disclaiming to any Knowledge at all of the <hi>Plot.</hi> By the <hi>Next day,</hi> he was brought to Understand, that though it was the <hi>Murther</hi> that made the <hi>Noise</hi> in the <hi>Proclamation,</hi> he would yet find the Discovery of the <hi>Plot</hi> to be the Nearest way to the <hi>Five-hundred-Pound</hi> that was Promis'd in't; so that on the 8<hi>th,</hi> he gave the Lords Committees a General Touch of the <hi>Popish Lords; Commissions; Armies</hi> to be rais'd; of [Coleman's <hi>being a Great Agitator in the Design against the King</hi>] The <hi>Iesuits</hi> in the <hi>Conspiracy, &amp;c. [Desiring Time to put the Whole Narrative in Writing, which he had Begun.</hi>] Now to Explain the Amusement of This Wild, and Uncertain <hi>Generality,</hi> the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was but of One Days standing; and they had not as yet Time enough to Concert the <hi>Particulars</hi>; so that the Bare <hi>Naming</hi> of the <hi>Lords,</hi> and their <hi>Commissions</hi>; The very Hinting of <hi>Armies</hi> to be Rais'd, and the simple Mention of <hi>Coleman</hi> for an <hi>Agitator,</hi> was as much as <hi>Bedloe</hi> durst venture Upon, without <hi>further Lights,</hi> and <hi>Instructions. Coleman's Accusation</hi> was then upon the Anvil; and the <hi>Plot</hi> the <hi>Ground-Work</hi> of the



<pb n="25" facs="tcp:57297:195"/>
Whole Transaction; but there was No want of Heart and good Will, All this While to the Emproving of This Occasion; and his desire of <hi>Time,</hi> to put the Whole <hi>Narrative</hi> in <hi>Writing,</hi> carry'd the very same Countenance, as if he should have said, [<hi>Pray My Lords spare us but Three or Four Days to Confer with the Managers of the Intrigue, and let us alone for a Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Hellish Popish Plot, ready Cut and Dry'd, and a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Witness to support it.</hi> This is so fair, and Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a Gloss upon the Text, That the Lords Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees were not without some Jelousies of it, even in the very First Instance; as appears upon the same Journal, by their asking <hi>Bedloe [Whether he knew</hi> Otes <hi>or not:]</hi> And why should <hi>Bedloe</hi> then <hi>Deny</hi> the knowledge of him, if he had not been Conscious that the Owning of an Acquaintance with him would have made the Evidence smell too Rank of a <hi>Confederacy?</hi> But to Touch This Matter to the Quick, It will appear by and By upon the Comparing of Notes, and Resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances that <hi>Bedloe</hi> and <hi>Prance</hi> were Initiated into This <hi>Mystery</hi> by the <hi>same</hi> Lesson of <hi>Instructions</hi>; only with <hi>This Difference</hi> in the <hi>Motives</hi> to what they did, that the <hi>One</hi> Forswore himself for <hi>Fear,</hi> and the <hi>Other,</hi> for <hi>Mony.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Bedloe</hi> (as I have sayd) gave Evidence to the <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> upon the 7<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> 1678. <hi>Prance</hi> was Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted on <hi>Saturday</hi> the 21. of <hi>December following [for Assisting in the Murther of Sir</hi> Edmund Bury Godfrey] He was Examin'd the same Night, and stood stiff in't, that he knew Nothing, either of the <hi>Death</hi> of <hi>Godfrey,</hi> or of the <hi>Popish Plot</hi>; and <hi>Bedloe</hi> was as Positive upon the First Examination, that He knew Nothing of the <hi>Plot</hi> neither. Now the <hi>Plot</hi> was a Thing so <hi>Necessary,</hi> that the <hi>Five-hundred-Pound-Murther</hi> would not have been worth <hi>Fifty Farthings</hi> without it: and though the Bait was thrown out for the Discoverers of the <hi>Murther,</hi>



                        <pb n="26" facs="tcp:57297:196"/>
the Anglers were yet secur'd before-hand, that upon a sound Bite, they should draw up a Discoverer of the <hi>Plot:</hi> for the Matter being Equally Both ways a <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury,</hi> the One they knew (as I have noted before) would be as Cheap as the other. They had both of them however, only <hi>One Night,</hi> and no more, to <hi>Sleep</hi> upon't: And it was Impossible, in that Pinch of Time, to bring their Matters to Agree in Every Point like a Pair of <hi>Tallyes:</hi> And therefore <hi>Bedloe</hi> was fain to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent himself at Present with <hi>a Tale of a Cock and a Bull,</hi> (Just as the Journal sets it forth) without any Preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy of <hi>Likelyhoods,</hi> or Particularity of <hi>Circumstances,</hi> to give it <hi>Credit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now <hi>Prance</hi> was upon his Peril to speak out, at <hi>Four-and-Twenty-hours-warning</hi> too; for on the same Day that he was taken up, and Examin'd, (Damning himself to the Pit of Hell if he knew any thing either of the <hi>Death,</hi> or of the <hi>Plot</hi>) he was Committed to the <hi>Condemn'd Hole</hi> in <hi>Newgate</hi>; Loaden with <hi>Heavy Irons</hi>; And for That Night left to Chew upon't, whether he would venture his <hi>Soul,</hi> or his <hi>Carcass</hi>; (which was the very Choice Before him) In This Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition he lay, both of <hi>Body,</hi> and of <hi>Mind</hi>; till Early next Morning (being <hi>Sunday</hi>) when Up comes a Person to him Wholly Unknown, Layes down a Paper upon a Form just by him, and so goes his way. Soon after This, Comes Another, with a Candle; sets it down, and Leaves him. By the light of that Candle <hi>Prance</hi> read the Paper, Wherein he found the Substance of These Following Minutes.</p>

Captain <hi>Richardson</hi> gave his Lordship an Account of it, and Thereupon, received [<hi>An Order for Bringing of</hi> Miles Prance <hi>to</hi> Shaftsbury-House, <hi>to be farther Examin'd.</hi>] He vvas Carry'd thither betwixt Five and Six the same Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and there Continued till about Eleven that Night. So soon as he came thither, he was Call'd into a Low Parlour where was <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> (and Three more) And there Examin'd strictly upon the Points of the Paper; and Threatned with <hi>Hanging</hi> if he did not <hi>Confess.</hi> Upon these Menaces, <hi>Prance</hi> Yielded; and so fram'd a Pretended Discovery in Part, with a Promise to speak out more at Large, if he might have his Pardon. VVhereupon, there was a Paper drawn up, vvhich <hi>Prance Sign'd,</hi> and he vvas then return'd to the Place from vvhence he came. By this time they had secured Three Strings to their Bovv; and it is vvorthy of a Note, that <hi>Bedloe</hi> and <hi>Prance,</hi> like a Couple of <hi>School-Boys</hi> of the same Form, had in Effect the very <hi>same Lesson</hi> given them, and the very same Allovvance of <hi>Time</hi> to <hi>get it by Heart</hi> in.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>WE have Already given a General, and a Suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Account (in the Last Chapter but one) of the Evidences Deliver'd by <hi>Bedloe</hi> and <hi>Prance,</hi> upon the Subject of the <hi>Plot:</hi> And we are now to take into Consideration the <hi>Competency,</hi> the <hi>Fairness,</hi> the <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>



                        <pb n="29" facs="tcp:57297:197"/>
and the <hi>Consistency</hi> of Those Depositions. In the First Place, the <hi>Omissions,</hi> and <hi>Enlargements</hi> that appear in the <hi>several Enformations,</hi> upon Comparing them One with another. Now this is a Point not to be Cleared, without <hi>References, Repetitions,</hi> and <hi>Reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals:</hi> So that there's No help for't, but by making them as Few, and as Short as may be.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. I find it upon the Lord's Journal, <hi>that the Monks of</hi> Doway <hi>gave</hi> Bedloe <hi>the Sacrament Four Times, upon a Charge of</hi> Secrecy. Nov. 12. 1678.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. And again: <hi>That</hi> Bedloe <hi>Demanded of</hi> Mr. Gage <hi>the Rector of the</hi> English College, <hi>what they would do with the King. He Answered,</hi> They would keep him well in a Convent.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Bedloe <hi>then Demanded who should Govern in Chief; He told him there should be a Tender made to [ONE] of the Crown, if he would Acknowledge it from the Church; but they did believe he would not Accept of it, and then the Government should be left to some Lords that the Pope would appoint; which Lords he would not tell me, but said, I should know it from the Monks at</hi> Paris. Lords Journal, <hi>Ib.</hi>

                     <p n="4">4. <hi>He says again in the same Deposition as is Already hinted in the Third Chapter, Who were to</hi> Govern, <hi>Who</hi> Told <hi>him so.</hi> Ten Thousand <hi>from</hi> Flanders <hi>to Land at</hi> Bridlington-Bay. <hi>The Lord</hi> Powes, Petres, <hi>&amp;c. to</hi> Rendezvous <hi>in</hi> South-Wales <hi>with Another Army, and They to Ioyn</hi> Twenty or Thirty Thousand more, <hi>that were to Land at</hi> Milford Haven <hi>from the</hi> Groin <hi>in</hi> Spain, <hi>which Army was to be [RELIGIOVS] Men and [PIL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GRIMS] from</hi> St. Jago <hi>in</hi> Spain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Lords Journal, Ibid.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Forty Thousand Men <hi>ready in</hi> London, <hi>Beside Those that would on the</hi> Alarum <hi>be Posted at Every Ale-House Door, to have Kill'd the Soldiers as they went out of their Quarters.</hi>

                        <pb n="30" facs="tcp:57297:198"/>6. Le Phaire <hi>told him also that when any</hi> Plotter <hi>was taken up, he should be kill'd before he was brought to his Tryal, or the Prison Burnt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">7. <hi>And That</hi> Guernsey <hi>and</hi> Jersey <hi>were to be surpriz'd by a Power from</hi> Brest, <hi>and other Places of</hi> France; <hi>and that several</hi> French Ships <hi>have layn in, and about the</hi> Channel <hi>All This Summer upon the same Occasion.</hi>

                     <p n="8">8 <hi>And further,</hi> Le Phaire, Pritchard, <hi>&amp;c.

                     </p>
                     <p>To Pass a Note or Two upon the Particulars above, they are of so great Importance to be Thoroughly Sifted, and made out, that the <hi>Plot it self,</hi> the <hi>Credit,</hi> and the very <hi>Being</hi> of it, <hi>stands,</hi> or <hi>falls,</hi> upon the <hi>Truth</hi> or <hi>Falsity</hi> of <hi>these Enformations.</hi> But the Stress does not lye so much upon <hi>True</hi> or <hi>False,</hi> as whether this be the <hi>Whole Truth,</hi> or <hi>Not</hi>; For All these Heads, and Circumstances of the Story upon the <hi>Lords Iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> (and the <hi>Four Evangelists</hi> over and above) are ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly <hi>Forgotten</hi> in the <hi>Evidence,</hi> upon the Tryal of the <hi>Pris'ners.</hi> Now if <hi>Bedloe</hi> Deliver'd the <hi>Whole Truth</hi> at <hi>First,</hi> how came he afterwards to <hi>Enlarge</hi> his <hi>Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But to Expound this Riddle now; he swore before the Lords to the <hi>Generals</hi> only of <hi>Otes's Plot</hi>; for <hi>Otes</hi> himself was not yet <hi>Resolv'd</hi> upon the <hi>Particulars:</hi> So that which way soever <hi>Titus Led, William</hi> was bound to <hi>Follow</hi>; and the Point of his <hi>Oath</hi> in <hi>Westminster-Hall</hi> was not Levell'd at the <hi>Plot it self,</hi> but at the <hi>Persons</hi> of the <hi>Pretended Conspirators.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now to trace Things in order as they lye before us: We hear Nothing of <hi>Four Sacraments</hi>; The <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent</hi>; The Tender of the <hi>Crown,</hi> and the <hi>Pope's Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution</hi>

                     <p>It is not to be Imagin'd, that <hi>Bedloe,</hi> upon his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated Oaths, before the King and the Lords, could Honestly forget so many remarkable Instances, of <hi>Men,</hi> and <hi>Things,</hi> as he calls Afterwards to Mind, and upon Recollection, swears to, over and above what he had sworn before.

                        <hi>He Carry'd a Pacquet,</hi> he says, <hi>from Mr.</hi> Coleman <hi>to</hi> Monsieur Le Chaise; <hi>and that he heard</hi> Coleman <hi>say, If he had an Hundred Lives, and a Sea of Bloud to carry on the Cause, he would spend it all to further the Cause of the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>and to establish the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>in</hi> England; <hi>And if there was an Hundred Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Kings to be Depos'd, He would see them All</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy'd.

present at the Resolution; and if all Fail'd,</hi> Sir Geo.

                     <p>And so again in the <hi>Tryal</hi> of the <hi>Five Iesuits. He brings in</hi> Whitebread <hi>for sending the</hi> Four Ruffians <hi>to</hi> Windsor: Coleman's Guinnea <hi>given to drink his Health; The</hi> 1500 l. <hi>again, and the</hi> 30000 Masses.

                     <p>He took the same Measures too, in the Bus'ness of <hi>Langhorn. Le Chaise</hi> told him, he says, of <hi>Mony</hi> to be remitted into <hi>England</hi>; and that he had remitted some of it to <hi>Coleman,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> p. 21. and he speaks of <hi>Three Letters</hi> that he saw <hi>Langhorn</hi> Transcribe; One to the <hi>English Monks</hi> at <hi>Paris</hi>; Another to <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur

                     </p>
                     <p>It would be Endless to take All his Evidences to Pieces, and to Confront one Testimony with Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: but one Instance may serve for the Measure of All: That is to say, his <hi>Additions</hi> are still, <hi>Stabbing,</hi> if not <hi>Mortal</hi>; and Adapted to the <hi>Case,</hi> without any regard to the <hi>Truth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As for <hi>Miles Prance,</hi> he was under the same Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment also, with his Brother <hi>Bedloe</hi>; only coming in Late, he had not so much occasion to shew his Parts; but he serv'd as well as the Best however, for a <hi>General Plot-man.</hi> He made several Proffers yet at the Helping out of the Conspiracy, though to little or no Purpose; only in the Case of <hi>Fenwick,</hi> he had the Honour to pass, with <hi>Otes,</hi> and <hi>Bedloe,</hi> for a <hi>Third Witness.</hi> His was only a dull kind of <hi>Hackney-Story</hi> still; that Mr. <hi>Messenger was to Kill the King.</hi> 50000 <hi>Men to be rais'd; The Popish Lords to Command them; Fenwick, Ireland,</hi> and <hi>Grove,</hi> spake of this Together; <hi>Harcourt</hi> said the King was to be kill'd by several; and <hi>Fenwick</hi> said that <hi>Langhorn</hi> was to have a great hand in't. <hi>Lang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn's Tryal,</hi> fol. 8. He brought in <hi>All the Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques</hi> he could Name, for an <hi>Appendix,</hi> 'tis true, but made Little on't, and order'd his Matters all the way with an Eye to his <hi>First Paper.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Upon the whole matter, Right or Wrong, here's <hi>Perjury</hi> without <hi>Dispute,</hi> either for not swearing the <hi>Whole Truth</hi> at <hi>First,</hi> or for swearing <hi>More then the Truth, afterward</hi>; and the Presumption of the <hi>Perjury</hi> is so much the <hi>stronger,</hi> in Regard that almost All the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities,</hi> and <hi>Additions</hi> in the Evidence upon the <hi>Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als,</hi> are Expresly Calculated, (as I have Already ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd) for the <hi>Destruction</hi> of the <hi>Pris'ners</hi>: And This

is not All Neither; for <hi>Bedloe</hi> lyes much opener in his <hi>Disagreements</hi> and <hi>Contradictions,</hi> then he does in his <hi>Omissions</hi> and <hi>Supplements</hi>; though it is Manifest, well-nigh to a <hi>Demonstration,</hi> that all his <hi>Capital Oaths</hi> were Apply'd only to the Serving of a <hi>Turn.</hi> And so I shall go on with him upon the two Latter Points.</p>
                     <p>He swears before the Lords, that the Army of <hi>Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or Thirty Thousand Men</hi> who were to Land at <hi>Milford Haven</hi> from the <hi>Groin,</hi> was to be <hi>Religious</hi> Men and <hi>Pilgrims,</hi> from St. <hi>Iago</hi> in <hi>Spain.

But then in <hi>Langhorn</hi>'s <hi>Tryals,</hi> He Swears, <hi>That they had provided in</hi> Spain, <hi>under the Notion of Pilgrims from</hi> St. Jago, <hi>some Irish Cashier'd Soldiers, that had left their Country, some for Religion, and some for their Crimes, and a great many</hi> Lay-Brothers, <hi>whom they had procur'd and gathered together, under the Notion of</hi> Pilgrims, <hi>to be ready to take Shipping at the</hi> Groin, <hi>to Land at</hi> Milford-Haven, <hi>There to meet my Lord</hi> Powis, <hi>and an Army that he was to raise in</hi> Wales <hi>to further this Design,</hi> fol. 20.</p>
                     <p>In a Deposition before the Lords, he swears himself to have been of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> till within These <hi>Two Years</hi>; That by Perswasion and Promises from the Jesuits, he was drawn over to them. <hi>Lords Iournal, Nov.</hi> 8. 1678. But upon the Tryal of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> he Swears, <hi>That he had been Five Years almost Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed by the Society of</hi> Jesuits, <hi>and the</hi> English Monks <hi>at</hi> Paris, <hi>to carry and bring Letters between them,</hi> &amp;c.

                     </p>
                     <p>Sir George Wakeman, he says, <hi>received a Bill of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change from Mr.</hi> Harcourt, <hi>and he was told,</hi> here is a Bill of Exchange for 2000 l. as part of a greater Summ, <hi>To which</hi> Sir George Wakeman <hi>Answered: that</hi> 15000 <hi>l. was a small reward for the setling of Religion, and preserving the Three Kingdoms, &amp;c.</hi> Five Jesuits Tryal, p. 35. <hi>And after he had given</hi> Sir George Wakeman <hi>the</hi> Bill, Sir George Wakeman open'd <hi>it, and</hi> Read <hi>it.</hi> Ib.]</p>
                     <p>And then in the next Page, says <hi>Bedloe, I did</hi> only [<hi>see</hi>] the <hi>Bill</hi> out of <hi>Mr. Harcourt's hand:</hi> but it was <hi>[Read] There</hi> only by <hi>Sir George Wakeman.</hi> In <hi>fol.</hi> 36. <hi>Sir George Wakeman</hi> Receiv'd the Bill of Exchange from Mr. <hi>Harcourt,</hi> he <hi>Read</hi> it <hi>Himself, Folded</hi> it up, and went and Received the Mony.</p>
                     <p>Note here, that before the <hi>Council,</hi> [HARCOURT] <hi>Read</hi> it; but in the <hi>Iesuiss Tryal,</hi> [WAKEMAN] only Read it. In the <hi>former,</hi> the <hi>Two Thousand Pounds</hi> was for <hi>Sir Georges Present Supply</hi>; In the <hi>Latter,</hi> it was as <hi>Part of a greater Summ.</hi> In the <hi>Former, Sir George</hi> seem'd well enough <hi>Content</hi> with the 15000 l. In the <hi>Latter,</hi> he thought it too <hi>Little.</hi> Nay in <hi>fol.</hi> 35. <hi>Sir George open'd</hi> it, which Implyes, it was Then <hi>Folded</hi>; and yet <hi>fol.</hi> 36. <hi>Sir George Wakeman Folded</hi> it up, not <hi>Folded it up Again:</hi> But <hi>Barely [Folded it up,]</hi> which looks as if it had not been Folded before.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Sir George Wakeman's Tryal,</hi> he says, <hi>that</hi> Sir Geo.

small Bill, &amp;c.</hi> Ib. (<hi>of</hi> 2000 <hi>l.</hi>) Well, <hi>sayd</hi> Sir George, <hi>I will go and see if the</hi> Bill <hi>be</hi> accepted, <hi>and you shall hear of me to Night. And</hi> Bedloe <hi>met him Presently after, and</hi> Sir George <hi>told him it</hi> was <hi>accepted, and that he was to go in the Afternoon to</hi> Receive <hi>it,</hi> Ib. Soon after This, He <hi>is</hi> Call'd upon to go over with This Part of his Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence again, fol. 46. and <hi>There</hi> we have him <hi>searching among his</hi> Bags, <hi>and finding a Little Note among them:</hi> And the Relation Effectually to be quite Another Thing.</p>
                     <p>He is <hi>Now</hi> got into Clear Another story than the <hi>Two Former</hi>; for there was no such Question as [<hi>Have you any Thing for Me?</hi>] No such Peevishness, or Hesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, as [<hi>I don't know whether I shall or No</hi>] In <hi>One</hi> Deposition, <hi>Five or Six</hi> Papers taken out of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet, Whereas in the other Depositions, there's men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made only of <hi>One.</hi> Nor is there any Talk of <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance</hi> or <hi>Payment.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There remains Yet <hi>Another</hi> scruple with a respect to the <hi>Timing</hi> of This action, which is <hi>Never</hi> to be Reconcil'd. He makes it before the <hi>Council,</hi> to have been the <hi>Latter part</hi> of the <hi>last Summer,</hi> i. e. 1678. That <hi>This Meeting</hi> was in <hi>Harcourt's Chamber [It was (I think, says He) about the beginning of</hi> August. <hi>Sir George Wakeman's Tryal, fol.</hi> 37.] But being Press'd afterward by <hi>Sir George Wakeman</hi> in These words [<hi>What Day was it, that I had the Discourse with</hi> Harcourt, <hi>and Received the Bill from him, as You say?</hi>]</p>
                     <p>[<hi>Mr.</hi> Bedloe] <hi>To satisfie you as well as I can, I say it was the Beginning of</hi> August, <hi>or</hi> Part <hi>of the</hi> Beginning. <hi>I do not speak to a</hi> Day, <hi>p.</hi> 40.</p>
                     <p>So that according to <hi>Bedloe's Oath</hi> before the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, of <hi>Iune</hi> 24. 1679. Mr. <hi>Harcourt</hi> gives <hi>Sir George Wakeman</hi> a Hint, which <hi>Bedloe</hi> Understood to be Meant of <hi>his being Employ'd to kill</hi> Sir Edmund-bury Godfrey, and <hi>Bedloe</hi> looks the same way in his Evidence at <hi>Sir George Wakeman's Tryal. Sir George</hi> asked of <hi>Harcourt</hi>

                     <p>Now upon the Upshot of the Matter, <hi>Bedloe</hi> swears that Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey</hi> was <hi>Murthered</hi> because of <hi>Tong</hi>'s and <hi>Otes</hi>'s <hi>Enformations</hi> that he had Taken: and <hi>Bedloe</hi> was Employed at the <hi>Beginning</hi> of <hi>August</hi> to Destroy <hi>Godfrey,</hi> for having Taken those <hi>Enformations,</hi> which he never <hi>Took,</hi> nor ever so much as <hi>heard</hi> of, till the <hi>Sixth</hi> of the <hi>Following September.</hi>

                     <p>His Swearing Off and On in the Case of <hi>Whitebread</hi> and <hi>Fenwick,</hi> was a Notable Cast of his Faculty too; that is to say, They, being upon their Tryals with <hi>Ireland, Grove,</hi> and <hi>Pickering, Bedloe</hi> declares, that [<hi>he does not Charge any Man but them Three</hi>] and when he was told by the Court, [<hi>What he said was not any Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence against</hi> Whitebread:] and demanded what he could say as to <hi>Fenwick:</hi> his Answer was in These words, [<hi>No more then as I have to Mr</hi> VVhitebread. <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ands Tryal,</hi> fol. 42.] But This Notwithstanding <hi>Whitebread</hi> and <hi>Fenwick</hi> were remanded back to the Goale, by reason that <hi>Otes</hi>'s <hi>Testimony</hi> was so <hi>Full:</hi> It being Insisted on, That the King having sent forth a Proclamation for <hi>further Discovery,</hi> there was [<hi>No Question made, but that before the Time therein prefixed should come out, there would come in more Evidence.</hi> Ib. pag. 56.</p>
                     <p>This was at the <hi>Sessions-House</hi> at the <hi>Old-Bayly; December</hi> 17. 1678. where They were brought upon their Tryals again on the 13. and 14. of <hi>Iune,</hi> 1679. at which Tryal, <hi>Bedloe</hi> Charged <hi>Whitebread</hi> upon the Matter of the <hi>Four Ruffians</hi> that were sent to <hi>Windsor</hi> about <hi>September,</hi> fol. 32. and <hi>Whitebread,</hi> and <hi>Fenwick, Both,</hi> with being <hi>Privy and Consenting to the Practice,</hi> fol. 33. <hi>Bedloe's</hi> Evidence pass'd for Currant, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing

This Train of <hi>Fore-cast,</hi> brings us Decently to <hi>Primrose-Hill</hi>; and whether he went Thither by <hi>Horse, Chair, Litter, Coach,</hi> or <hi>Waggon,</hi> it Matters not a Single Marque, Provided there be a <hi>Decorum</hi> in the Story; and that the Thing be done <hi>A-Gods-Name,</hi> as they say, and without the Help of <hi>Spirits,</hi> or <hi>Art Magick</hi> to Convey him Thither.

though they got him at last into</hi> Somerset-House Court; <hi>While Somebody was gone as pretended to fetch a Constable; and after a Turn or Two, there came Two Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons more, and shov'd him into a Room; Presented a Pistol to shoot him, if he made a Noise; but if he would Answer their Expectation, they would do him no Harm; and so they bad him send fon the Examinations.

In the Room were a Great many: I can't tell who they All were</hi> [Mr. <hi>Iustice Iones</hi>] VVhat kind of Light had they Mr. <hi>Prance?</hi> [Mr. <hi>Prance</hi>] It was a Middle-siz'd Lanthorn.

[Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi>] No, and they did not open it 'till I had had a Turn about the Room. <hi>Vpon this, They Threw off the Thing that was layd upon Him, fol.</hi> 31. <hi>and</hi> Bedloe <hi>knew him; And he had about his Neck such a kind of</hi> Crevat (says he) <hi>as This about my Neck, and I went to Try and could not get my Finger in betwixt.</hi> Bedloe <hi>would have had Weights Ty'd to his Head and Feet, and Thrown him into the River.

                                    <hi>One Day</hi> (says Mr. Bedloe) <hi>I met with</hi> Prance <hi>in the Lobby.</hi>

                                 <p>It is to be Noted here, that <hi>Bedloe</hi> had said Nothing at All as Yet of <hi>seeing Prance</hi> with the <hi>Body</hi>; but it was found a Necessary <hi>Tack</hi> for the Holding of the <hi>Story</hi> Together, That the <hi>Two Chief Murtherers</hi> should be brought <hi>Acquainted.</hi>

                                 <p>Bedloe <hi>says further, he saw</hi> Green <hi>about the Court, and was told that</hi> Berry <hi>was to open the</hi> Gate; <hi>but he did not see</hi> Hill.

The Consta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Asking him, Mr.</hi> Prance, Will you see Mr. <hi>Bedloe?</hi> No <hi>(he said)</hi> he would not; And then <hi>Prance</hi> put his Hat over his Eyes, that <hi>Bedloe</hi> might not see his Face, [<hi>fol.</hi> 3.] <hi>But</hi> Bedloe <hi>calling to have the Lobby Clear'd, he happen'd at</hi> Prance<hi>'s coming by, to cast his Eyes upon his Face, and presently knew him, and Cry'd,</hi> Oh! Pray Sir Stay; you are one of my Friends that must stay here: <hi>And I presently Charg'd my Guards to take Charge of him. Saith the Constable,</hi> He is my Pris'ner. Is he so, <hi>said I?</hi> Then you have a very good Pris'ner: And Pray look safe to him: <hi>And then when I went into the House of</hi> Lords, <hi>I made out my Charge against him,</hi> fol. 34.</p>

Night</hi> at Nine of the Clock.

                     <p>He was told upon the 8<hi>th.</hi> That they stifled <hi>Godfrey</hi> betwixt <hi>Two Pillows.</hi> On the 12<hi>th.</hi> That he was stifled with a <hi>Pillow:</hi> And upon the <hi>Tryal, fol.</hi> 32. was told they had <hi>Strangled</hi> him, but <hi>he did not know How.</hi>

He says again, That <hi>He did not see</hi> Le Phaire, <hi>from</hi> Sunday, <hi>to</hi> Monday Night, <hi>pag.</hi> 31. And yet before the Lords, <hi>he met him by Accident, upon</hi> Sunday, <hi>in</hi> Fleetstreet. <hi>The Iesuits,</hi> he says, <hi>that were about the</hi> Body, <hi>and had Employ'd him to Insinuate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self into</hi> Godfrey<hi>'s Acquaintance, thought he had not

Soon after This, there was a <hi>Tankard</hi> gone; and a Squabble about it; but in short, <hi>Prance</hi> never heard more of his Tankard;



<pb n="52" facs="tcp:57297:209"/>
He had his <hi>Rent Paid</hi> him on <hi>St. Thomas Eve,</hi> 1678.

                     <p>Now the Truth of this Matter is quite Another Thing from the Bus'ness of the <hi>Lobby,</hi> as <hi>Bedloe</hi> has Reported it in his <hi>Evidence, Tryal</hi> 33, 34. for <hi>Bedloe</hi> did not Apprehend <hi>Prance,</hi> as he says, but he was in Custody already; No such Question asked by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable as <hi>Mr. Prance,</hi> will you see Mr. <hi>Bedloe?</hi> No <hi>Plucking his Hat over his Eyes</hi>; Not one Word sayd <hi>Bedloe</hi> to <hi>Prance</hi>; No Bidding of his <hi>Guards</hi> to take <hi>Charge</hi> of him. And so for the Bus'ness of his going to <hi>Bristoll,</hi> in such Trouble of Mind forsooth, for <hi>the Murthers that had been Already Committed, and the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er One's that were Daily intended, and his being at last

                     <p>William Boyce, <hi>who had also been with</hi> Prance, <hi>tells the Lords, That</hi> he Enquir'd for his Wife, and was glad to hear she was not in Prison.</p>
                     <p>That he fear'd he should be Hang'd, by what my <hi>Lord Shaftsbury</hi> told him, That if he did not <hi>Confess,</hi> and <hi>Agree</hi> with <hi>Bedloe</hi> in what Concern'd the <hi>Murther,</hi> that he should be Hang'd.</p>
                     <p>He also seem'd to fear that Those Three whom he accus'd, (meaning <hi>Green, Berry,</hi> and <hi>Hill</hi>) were set at Liberty; That he would <hi>Confess All,</hi> if he were sure of his <hi>Pardon;</hi> That he desired to speak with the <hi>Lord Shaftsbury</hi> about <hi>Four Men</hi> that had a Design to Murther him.</p>

Their Lordships presently Signed a Warrant for the Apprehending of These Men, and Appointed <hi>Sir Robert Southwell</hi> to go in the Afternoon to acquaint the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> therewith. The Persons Accus'd were <hi>Humphry Adamson, George Bradshaw, Benedict Prosser,</hi> and <hi>Christopher Maddi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Boyce</hi> further Enform'd their Lordships on the day above, that being This morning in <hi>Newgate</hi> with hopes to have found <hi>Prance</hi> in the same Temper; he found him so sullen that he would not speak a Word to him, but laying down his Face upon his Arms, Cryed out, and often Repeated, <hi>I have Committed No Murther.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Captain <hi>Richardson</hi> being Examin'd what might be the Cause of This Fright from whence All These Changes seem to Arise; says that he cannot Imagine, unless it were that when once he brought him down, several People came to Enquire of him, when the Men, meaning the <hi>Three Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd</hi> would be <hi>Executed</hi>: wherein he might perhaps think himself Concern'd. That <hi>Prance</hi> had once told him of a Whisper through the Key-hole, which he Believed not; but supposes Another thing might be True which is said by him, that <hi>Moore,</hi> and <hi>Messenger,</hi> being here Attending when he was brought, did <hi>Beckon</hi> to him, which made him alter his Mind.</p>

I never saw it before, or since, that I remember; nor saw it then, but only by a small Candle Light. It was wall'd strong and close, with great Pieces of Timber; And yet it was very <hi>Cold</hi> through the <hi>Extreme Hardness</hi> of the <hi>Weather.

(<hi>Now This was the</hi> Flock-bed, <hi>and</hi> Blanket <hi>before mentioned by</hi> Cooper.) When the Captain call'd him up, he seem'd to have very little Strength in him, but with much ado, he came to me at the Chimney, where I think there was a little Fire; but I am not certain of this. The Captain with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew, and I said to him what I ought in Obedience to the Order that was given me.

a good while, I spoke All that was said, and he did not An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer a Word to me: perhaps he could not, for he seem'd to be <hi>Stupified</hi> with <hi>Cold.</hi> By Degrees, he seem'd to come to himself; and then complained Extremely of <hi>Pains,</hi> one while in his <hi>Arms,</hi> Another while in his <hi>Legs, Roaring</hi> with it, till the Natural Heat had prevail'd. Then he seem'd to be a New Man, and spake to me of his own Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord to This Purpose, <hi>[I remember you were with me the last Night, and then I promised you I would tell you All that I knew;]</hi> and then he began to open to me so freely, not only of the <hi>Murther</hi> of <hi>Sir E.

                     <q>The Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> call'd to her, saying, <hi>You Damn'd Woman, what Devillish Paper is This you have given us in?</hi> Putting her upon her Oath to Declare who <hi>Wrote</hi> it; calling her <hi>Bitch,</hi> and other Vile Names, and Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning her, That if she would not <hi>Confess,</hi> that Sir <hi>John Banks,</hi> Mr. <hi>Pepys,</hi> and <hi>Monsieur de Puy</hi> set her on to write that Paper, she should he Torn to Pieces by the <hi>Multitude;</hi> Threatning her to have her Worry'd as the <hi>Dogs</hi> Worry <hi>Cats,</hi> insomuch that she fell into <hi>Fits</hi> upon't, and thought she should never have got home.</q>
                     <p>Note, that the Enformation above spoken of, was Deliver'd to Sir <hi>Leoline Ienkins</hi> several Years before ever I had the Knowledge of her Person; and that she Deliver'd me a Copy of the said Enformation, with <hi>This following Postscript</hi> at the Bottom of it.</p>
                     <q>I <hi>Mary Gibbon</hi> am Indisposed in <hi>Health;</hi> but whether I Live, or Dye, in the Presence of God, and his Holy Angels, I do make <hi>Oath,</hi> that this is every Syllable True; And I have left the same, and made Oath of it to a Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Gentleman, a <hi>Secretary of State</hi> very Lately; and if I <hi>Live</hi> till 'tis Questioned, I will <hi>Witness</hi> it.</q>
                     <p>There remains yet a very remarkable Instance of the <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Generosity</hi> of a Poor <hi>Hackney Coach-man</hi>; his Name <hi>Francis Corral</hi>; And if I could Contribute as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

[Yes, <hi>my Lord, (said this Enformant)</hi> I know it will be a Dreadful Hearing: But, my Lord, It will be a more Dreadful Hearing for me, at the Lord's Bar, if I should wrongfully accuse any Man; it will be a more Dreadful Hearing, when it shall be said, <hi>Take him away Devil, for he hath falsly Accus'd those he knew no hurt by. Whereupon the Lord</hi> Shaftsbury <hi>said,</hi> I see we can do no good with him; take him away, and let him lye there and Rot. <hi>This Enformant Pleading that he had a</hi> Wife, <hi>and</hi> Children; <hi>the Lord</hi> Shaftsbury <hi>Answered,</hi> Let his Wife and Children starve. <hi>This Enformant lay in the</hi> Condemn'd Hole <hi>with</hi> Heavy <hi>Irons,</hi> Six Weeks <hi>and</hi> Three Days; <hi>and afterwards,</hi> Seven Weeks <hi>on the</hi> Common Side <hi>upon</hi> Bords, without Irons.</p>

                     <p>But Thirdly; The <hi>Timing</hi> of it was the Great Point of All; for the whole Nation was then at <hi>Gaze</hi> upon the <hi>Tryals</hi> of the <hi>Pretended Murthers</hi> of Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey,</hi> and most People were of Opinion, that the <hi>Suppos'd Popish Plot</hi> was to <hi>Stand</hi> or <hi>Fall,</hi> upon <hi>That Issue</hi>: But for my own Part, I was never of that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasion: If the <hi>Verdict</hi> went against the <hi>Pris'ners,</hi> it was Reasonable Enough to expect that it would make a <hi>Horrible Noise</hi>; Especially considering the <hi>Pompous Solemnities</hi> that had Prepar'd Men Already, for <hi>Wild</hi> and <hi>Dangerous Impressions.</hi> And then on the <hi>other</hi> hand, if they had been <hi>Acquitted,</hi> it was but <hi>Arraigning</hi> the <hi>Bench,</hi> the <hi>Iury,</hi> and the <hi>Witnesses,</hi> as they did in other Cases Afterwards to make All <hi>whole again.</hi> This does not <hi>Hinder,</hi> but that <hi>Otes</hi> and <hi>Bedloe</hi> did very Prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>strike while the Iron was hot</hi>; for the <hi>Tryal</hi> bears <hi>Date</hi> the 10<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> 1678/9. the <hi>Day</hi> of the <hi>Conviction</hi> of the <hi>Three Pris'ners.</hi> And these <hi>Two Blades</hi> put in their <hi>Bills,</hi> the very <hi>same Week</hi> with the <hi>Tryals; Otes</hi>

                     <p>As to <hi>Prance</hi>'s <hi>Character,</hi> All that I shall say of it is This; that he had a <hi>good Will</hi> to be <hi>Honest,</hi> but not the <hi>Heart</hi> to go <hi>thorough</hi> with it; and that he took more <hi>Care</hi> of his <hi>Carcase</hi> at <hi>First,</hi> then he did <hi>after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> of his <hi>Conscience.</hi> I shall do him <hi>This Common right</hi> yet, to say, that he had not the <hi>Brand</hi> upon him of <hi>an infamous Course of Life,</hi> to <hi>Blast</hi> his <hi>Evidence</hi> as his <hi>Fellow-Witnesses</hi> had: And This may serve, in some sort, to Colour the Easiness of Those that gave <hi>Credit</hi> to him.

                           <p>HEaring that you are about to Publish something concerning the Death of Sir <hi>Edmunbury Godfrey,</hi> I think it my Duty to take Shame upon me, and to make a Publique Declaration to the World of my Confession and Repentance of the Heinous Sins that I have committed against God, and my Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces against his Sacred Majesty, my most Gracious



<pb n="127" facs="tcp:57297:246"/>
Mistress the Queen Dowager, the Noblemen, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and All others that I have wickedly and wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully Accus'd about the Death of That Gentleman. I cannot hope or expect that any thing I say should find Credit in the World; but it will be some Ease to my Conscience, if I may obtain the favour of a Place for this Declaration any where among your Papers, if you shall commit any upon This Subject to the Press.</p>
                           <p>From the time of taking off my Irons, and changing my Lodging, which was upon my Yielding Basely to Forswear my self against those Innocent Persons, <hi>Green, Berry,</hi> and <hi>Hill,</hi> that Dy'd upon my Wicked Evidence: <hi>Mr. Boyce</hi> was the Man that Acted for me, and writ many Things which I Copy'd after him; I found by his Discourse that he had been several Times with my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> and with <hi>Bedloe;</hi> and he told me, that I would be certainly Hang'd, if I did not agree with <hi>Bedloe's</hi> Evidence, and own the Periwig, the Men would not be Hang'd; I would not yield to't, so he yielded to mine, and the Periwig was spoke no more on; and bidding me consider what a Condition I should be in, if any of them should confess first. He got me out of <hi>Newgate</hi> some few Days after the Tryal of <hi>Green, &amp;c.</hi> But before any of them were Executed, <hi>Mr. Boyce</hi> told me how much some of Sir <hi>Edmund's</hi> Relations were troubled that I was out so soon, for fear I should deny all again; and so <hi>Mr. Boyce</hi> took me to his own House, and watched me, and went with me <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

men were Executed. I would fain have had <hi>Berry</hi> sav'd, but <hi>Mr. Boyce</hi> said he was Guilty of the <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> and could not be sav'd; and that if the King had a mind to pardon him, he might do it without my Troubling my self.</p>
                           <p>It was purely the fear of Death, and the Misery of my Condition, that wrought upon me to For swear my self, without any thought of reward, although I was told several Times that Great Things would be done for me. My Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> told me my Trade should be Better then ever it was, and bought some Plate of me Himself, part whereof was for <hi>Otes.</hi> This brings to my Mind that in the Time while I Deny'd the <hi>Murther,</hi> or any Knowledge of it, I was taken out of <hi>Newgate,</hi> and carry'd to Two Eminent Lawyers, where I was Vpbraided for departing from my Evidence; One of them, wondring much what should make me do it, and speaking to me to this Effect, <hi>[You were affraid, perhaps, of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing your Trade, that lay mostly among the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists; or else perchance you did not think your self sure of your Pardon,</hi> &amp;c.] which Words were spoken in such a way, that I took them for Hints to me what Excuse I might make upon going off again, and as I am a <hi>Christian,</hi> This was it that first put That Excuse into my Head. My Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> gave me <hi>Two Guinnea's</hi> once, to help off a Man that I had Sworn against for Dangerovus Words against the King. I received <hi>Thirty Pounds</hi> by his <hi>Majesties</hi> Order, and <hi>Five Pounds</hi> of <hi>Bedloe.</hi>

                              <pb n="129" facs="tcp:57297:247"/>As to those I swore against about the Plot; If I may take the Names as they lye in the Narrative: I Accus'd one of the <hi>Townleys</hi> of <hi>Townley</hi> in <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cashire,</hi> with saying, <hi>[That when his Brothers, who were then at</hi> Doway, <hi>came back from</hi> Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, <hi>they expected to receive Commissions from the Lord</hi> Bellassis, <hi>and other Catholick Lords concern'd for the raising of Men to carry on the</hi> Catholique Cause; <hi>and that I had heard</hi> Adamson <hi>a Watch-maker several Times speak of this at the Club in</hi> Veer-street. I do declare in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God Almighty, that the Accusation is false in every Point of it, both concerning <hi>Mr. Townley</hi> and <hi>Mr. Adamson. See Narrative, fol. 3.</hi> I do declare likewise, That I was no otherwise put upon it, then by a Paper that was brought to me in the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd Hole,</hi> and by the Menaces of Hanging me, if I did not confess more and more, saying, <hi>Hang him Rogue, He thinks This shall save him.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>I Accus'd <hi>Mr. Keightly</hi> also, when the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> &amp;c. was in the <hi>Tower, with Rejoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing at their Imprisonment, and the Differences amongst the Lords; and if the</hi> Duke of York <hi>did but follow the Bus'ness close, they doubted not but the Catholique Religion would be quickly settled,</hi> fol. <hi>3.</hi> I declare with the same Solemnity as aforesaid, I never knew nor heard that <hi>Mr. Keightly</hi> said any such Words. This Accusation was drawn up by <hi>Mr. B.</hi> from General Heads that I gave him, and one drew up the <hi>Narrative,</hi> wherein they both went further then I directed. They did as the

rest did; If I spoke a Word, they made Ten on't.</p>
                           <p>I accus'd <hi>Mr. Singleton</hi> a Priest, for saying, <hi>He hoped to be settled in a</hi> Parish Church <hi>within a</hi> Twelvemonth; <hi>and that he would make no more to stab Forty Parliament-men, then he would do to eat his Dinner,</hi> fol. <hi>4.</hi> which Accusation I do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to be utterly false, and of my own Framing.</p>
                           <p>And so likewise was that of <hi>Mr. Ridley</hi>'s saying, that <hi>He hoped to be Surgeon to the Catholique Army in</hi> England, <hi>and that he hoped to have the Lord</hi> Bellassis <hi>to Friend.</hi> Ibid.</p>
                           <p>My Accusation of <hi>Mr. Paston</hi> for saying, <hi>That the King was a great Heretick; but the Lord</hi> Bellassis, Arundel, Powis, <hi>and</hi> Petres <hi>would have a gallant Army for Deposing the King; and that they had already given out Commissions to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Gentlemen, as Sir</hi> Henry Beddingfield, <hi>Mr.</hi> Talbot, <hi>and Mr.</hi> Stoner, as was suggested to me by my first Paper of Instructions, but made much more in drawing up the <hi>Enformation</hi> and <hi>Narrative.</hi>

of Instructions, and they that drew up the Enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations made the rest.</p>
                           <p>I did falsely Accuse <hi>Le Phaire</hi> also, for a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourse about <hi>the Catholiques Providing Weap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> fol. <hi>6.</hi> and likewise <hi>Mr. Moor.</hi> Ibid. for <hi>speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Ten Thousand Horse to be shortly rais'd for the Catholique Cause.</hi> It was all false, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, and of my own Contrivance.</p>

                        <p>The Relation of <hi>Godfrey</hi>'s Murther, as it stands in the Narratives and Tryals, is one of the most Vnlikely Stories to be True, that ever was made Publique, and Believed.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THe <hi>Body</hi> was found in the <hi>Ditch; Cary'd Thence</hi> to the <hi>White House</hi>; And so they Proceeded upon it to a <hi>View,</hi> and to a <hi>Verdict:</hi> This was, in few Words, the <hi>Ground-Work</hi> of the <hi>History:</hi> They <hi>began,</hi> Effectually at the <hi>Wrong End,</hi> and, by an <hi>Inverted Way</hi> of <hi>Reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> instead of Drawing <hi>Conclusions</hi> from <hi>Premises; Their Bus'ness</hi> was <hi>Subsequently</hi> to <hi>Frame</hi> and <hi>Accommodate Premises,</hi> to a <hi>Fore-laid Conclusion.</hi> This Unhappy Gentleman, was, in Truth, Miserably Haunted with an <hi>Hereditary</hi> and a <hi>Fore-boding Melancholy</hi>; and it was the <hi>Manage</hi> of that <hi>Season</hi> to Improve <hi>Every Fit of the Spleen,</hi> into a <hi>Popish Dagger</hi> at the <hi>Heart</hi> of him: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch, that he was said to be <hi>Murther'd</hi> by the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,</hi> (as in <hi>Due Time</hi> and <hi>Place</hi> shall be made <hi>appear</hi>)

even while he was yet <hi>Alive:</hi> Nay, betwixt the <hi>Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> when he went <hi>away,</hi> and the <hi>Thursday Night Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,</hi> when he was <hi>found,</hi> it was in <hi>Every Bodies Mouth,</hi> that <hi>the Papists had Kill'd Sir</hi> Edmundbury Godfrey. The Resolution being already taken, to make a <hi>Popish Murther</hi> on't, and so to make a <hi>Popish Conspiracy</hi> the <hi>Root</hi> of This <hi>Popish Murther.</hi> Never was any thing more <hi>Ridiculously Order'd,</hi> from <hi>One End</hi> of the <hi>Series</hi> to the <hi>Other.</hi> First, for the <hi>Place</hi> in <hi>General,</hi> it was the <hi>Queens Palace</hi>; and then in <hi>Particular,</hi> where the <hi>Execution</hi> was <hi>done.

Beside that it was now but <hi>between Five and Six,</hi> by <hi>Bedloe's</hi> Account, and <hi>Nine a Clock</hi> at most, by <hi>Prance</hi>'s; a Time when People were every where <hi>up,</hi> and <hi>stirring,</hi> and the <hi>Porters Window</hi> over the <hi>Water-Gate</hi> look'd directly All this While, upon the <hi>Place</hi> where the <hi>Fact</hi> was said to be <hi>Committed.</hi>

                     <p>And then the <hi>Dogging</hi> of him at the Rate, and Manner, that they sayd they did; was a Notable Fetch of a Project too.

                     <p>Now This is so <hi>Notorious</hi> a <hi>Mistake,</hi> that he Liv'd in a strict Confidence, and Friendship, with Divers <hi>Roman Catholiques</hi> of <hi>No mean Quality,</hi> and <hi>Character</hi>: He was so far from <hi>Promoting</hi> the <hi>Plot,</hi> that he took it for a <hi>Cheat</hi> from the <hi>Beginning</hi>; Gave his <hi>Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> an <hi>Account</hi> of <hi>Otes</hi>'s <hi>Depositions</hi>; and so likewise to some <hi>Other Men of Honour</hi> of the <hi>Roman Communion</hi> upon the First Taking of them: Nay he was so Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of any Oppression That way, that upon the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of one Mr. <hi>Burnet</hi> a <hi>Priest</hi> before him to be Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin'd, and Proceeded against according to Law, Sir <hi>Edmund</hi> made his Application to Dr. <hi>Godden</hi> (then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Queen) about him; told him how it was, and, though at That Time a Stranger to him,

                     <p>So that hitherto, there appears neither <hi>Interest,</hi> nor <hi>Provocation, Private,</hi> or <hi>Publique,</hi> toward the taking away This Gentleman's Life; but, for want of a more Plausible Pretext, there has been Objected over and over the <hi>Frequency</hi> of his <hi>Exclamations,</hi> that he should be the <hi>First Martyr; That he should be the first Man to suffer in the Cause</hi>; and other various Readings upon Words of his to That Purpose, according to the <hi>Rellish</hi> of the People's <hi>Fancy,</hi> or <hi>Palate,</hi> that <hi>Heard</hi> them.

(though very Unwillingly, as appears over and over Already) Sir <hi>Godfrey</hi> reflected upon it, that he had made <hi>No Formal Discovery</hi> of the <hi>Pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Treason</hi>; and finding now that the Bus'ness was come to be <hi>Publique:</hi> the Matter being then brought before the <hi>Councel,</hi> he came to be Every day more and more Sensible of the Danger of the Misprision, and not without Several <hi>Hints,</hi> by the <hi>By,</hi> that he was like to be call'd to an <hi>Account</hi> for't, There being near a <hi>Month Past,</hi> from his <hi>First Enformation, Sept.</hi> 6. with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any <hi>Regular,</hi> or <hi>Effectual Notification</hi> of the Matter: And he was the <hi>More Frighten'd</hi> upon it, for the <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>service</hi> that he did to the <hi>Design</hi> of making a <hi>Plot</hi> on't: for <hi>he never Believ'd one Word of the Story</hi>; and told All People as much, where he thought he might Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Declare Himself.

Entertain <hi>All Colourable Suggestions,</hi> under so <hi>Popular</hi> a <hi>Pretence.</hi> It must be added now, that <hi>This Terrible Parliament it Self</hi> was to meet upon the 21<hi>th</hi> of That <hi>October:</hi> So that Sir <hi>Edmund</hi> had but a Matter of <hi>Three Weeks Time</hi> to <hi>Consider</hi> on't.

he has pass'd now these several years, for a <hi>Protestant Martyr:</hi> So that in <hi>Truth,</hi> the <hi>Parliament</hi> were the <hi>Papists</hi> that <hi>He Fear'd</hi>; which agrees with an <hi>Enformation</hi> above-mentioned of Mrs. <hi>Gibbon,</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd upon Oath, to a <hi>Secretary of State,</hi> long before ever I saw the Face of her. See the Particulars of This Relation, <hi>Cap.</hi> 20.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Wynnel</hi> Deposes as Follows; <hi>That going toward Mr.</hi> Goodwins (a Councellor at Law) <hi>with Sir</hi> E. B. Godfrey, <hi>about the Time of the</hi> Lords Commitment <hi>to the</hi> Tower; <hi>The</hi> Enformant <hi>was telling Sir</hi> Edmund, <hi>that the Lords could not be such</hi> Fools <hi>as to</hi> Think of such a Thing; <hi>or</hi> What Power <hi>had the</hi> Pope, <hi>in such or Such a</hi> Case? <hi>Sir</hi> Edmund <hi>Replying,</hi> No; He has None: The Lords are as Innocent as You or I: Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man will Dye; but not the Lords. <hi>To which This En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formant said,</hi> If so, Where are we then? <hi>Sir</hi> Edmund <hi>Replying,</hi> Otes <hi>is</hi> Sworn, <hi>and is</hi> Perjur'd. <hi>This Enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant bad him then Speak the</hi> Truth, <hi>and tell the</hi> Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>on't.</hi> [Why (<hi>says Sir</hi> Edmund) Consults <hi>about a</hi> Toleration; <hi>Nothing against the</hi> King; <hi>but there is a</hi> Design <hi>upon the Duke of</hi> York; <hi>and This will come to a</hi> Dispute <hi>among them.</hi> You <hi>may</hi> Live <hi>to see an</hi> End <hi>on't, but</hi> I shall not.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Wynnel</hi> says further; <hi>That upon his asking Sir</hi> E B. Godfrey <hi>some time why he was so</hi> Melancholy; <hi>his Answer has been, that he was</hi> Master of a Dangerous Secret, <hi>that would be</hi> Fatal <hi>to him: That his</hi> Security <hi>was</hi> Otes's Deposition, <hi>that he the said</hi> Otes had <hi>first Declar'd it to a Publique Minister: And</hi> 2ly. <hi>That he came to Sir Edmund by His Direction.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I could add <hi>More Instances,</hi> but This is a Redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance purely Superogatory; for the Case is Clear with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it.</p>

                     <p>I shall only take Notice of <hi>One Artificial Insinuation</hi> by the Way. [<hi>We Desire</hi> (says Mr. <hi>Attorney) to call the Surgeons that View'd and</hi> OPEN'D <hi>the</hi> Body, Mr. <hi>Skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larn,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cambridge,</hi> Tryal. fol. 30.] Now this was to possess the <hi>Audience</hi> with a <hi>Full Persuasion</hi> of the most <hi>Reasonable Thing</hi> in the World, and that the Body had been <hi>Open'd</hi> Indeed. Whereas there was <hi>No Open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of the Body; but on the contrary, the Thing was <hi>Mov'd</hi> and <hi>Desir'd,</hi> but the <hi>Brothers</hi> would not <hi>Permit</hi> it; and Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> (as he told me very Frankly, with his own Lips) was Absolutely <hi>for</hi> it; for, says he, upon the <hi>Opening</hi> of the <hi>Body, you should have known as well what Death he Dy'd, as if you had seen it.</hi> But now to the <hi>Evidence.</hi>

and <hi>Vnderstanding</hi> upon the <hi>Saturday</hi> then they had on <hi>Friday:</hi> So that the <hi>Iurors</hi> are Now to tell us what <hi>Wonderful Revelation</hi> they had the <hi>Day Following,</hi> to <hi>Clear</hi> This <hi>Mystery</hi>; Only a Word or Two, Previous to That Point.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>William Collins and Thomas Mason, Both</hi> Jury-Men <hi>saw Sir</hi> Edmund That Saturday Morning, <hi>The</hi> Former <hi>about</hi> Nine <hi>of the Clock talking with a</hi> Milk-woman <hi>near</hi> Paddington; <hi>The</hi> Other <hi>coming from</hi> Paddington-Ward, <hi>toward</hi> London, <hi>about</hi> Eleven, That Morning. We shall now see what it was that Sway'd the <hi>Verdict.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They were mov'd to the <hi>Verdict</hi> (says Mr. <hi>Harris</hi>) by an <hi>Oylman,</hi> and <hi>Others</hi> that saw him at <hi>Twelve.</hi> They sat Long (says Mr. <hi>Standever</hi>) and an <hi>Oylman</hi> and his <hi>Wife</hi> shew'd he was <hi>come back again.</hi> Mr. <hi>Mason</hi> says the same Thing too.</p>
                     <p>Now the Question was, upon the Evidence before the Jury, whether he was <hi>Strangled,</hi> or <hi>Kill'd</hi> with a <hi>Sword.</hi> They could not, it seems, agree upon the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, 'till they found that Mr. <hi>Radcliffe,</hi> and <hi>Others had Seen him about One of the Clock in the Strand near Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring-Cross That day</hi> that <hi>Collins</hi> had Seen him near <hi>Pad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dington</hi> in the <hi>Morning:</hi> and from hence they draw a <hi>Conclusion,</hi> he was <hi>Strangled.</hi> And why might they not as reasonably have Inferr'd from the Proof of his <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back again,</hi> that he Dy'd by the <hi>Sword,</hi> as by the <hi>Linnen Cloth</hi>? Beside that it was in Every bodies Mouth, before ever they came to a <hi>Verdict,</hi> that Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral People had seen him in his way <hi>toward Paddington back again</hi>: But we shall have a Better Occasion to look into This Particular, when we come to Discourse of the <hi>Witnesses</hi> that were made <hi>use</hi> of, and of Those that were <hi>Not,</hi> and into the <hi>Merits</hi> of <hi>That Evidence.</hi> In the Mean While, the <hi>Iurors</hi> were, in Effect, <hi>Totally led by the Surgeons.</hi>

                        <hi>The Surgeons told us so</hi> (says Mr. <hi>Harris) The Surge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons Iudg'd him strangled,</hi> says <hi>Mr. Cowsey:</hi> And so says Mr. <hi>Woollams</hi>: The <hi>Opinion</hi> of the <hi>Surgeons sway'd the Iury,</hi> says <hi>Mr. Standever.</hi> The <hi>Surgeons Opinion</hi> mov'd <hi>Mr. Fryer, Mr. Trotton,</hi> and effectually, <hi>All the Rest.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But All This had no Effect upon the <hi>Iury</hi> the <hi>First</hi> day; Nay the <hi>Iurors</hi> (says Mr. <hi>Trotton</hi>) were <hi>strongly of opinion</hi> that he was <hi>kill'd with the Sword,</hi> 'till <hi>the Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestness of the Surgeons prevail'd with them to give their Verdict Another way. Mr. Davies</hi> Declares that Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther He nor Any of his <hi>Fellow-Iurors</hi> were <hi>satisfy'd</hi> in the Bus'ness. But some would have it that he <hi>Kill'd Himself; Others,</hi> that he was <hi>Murther'd</hi> by <hi>some body else.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So much for the Point of the <hi>Surgeons leading the Iury</hi>; and it remains now to Examine the Weight of <hi>Those Reasons</hi> that Wrought upon the <hi>Surgeons,</hi> which I shall Handle with <hi>All due respects</hi> to their <hi>Abilities,</hi> to their <hi>Integrity,</hi> and to their <hi>Profession.</hi> Let me be Understood here, to Comprehend All Those Persons of <hi>Name</hi> and of <hi>Mark,</hi> that have Deliver'd their thoughts upon This Subject, <hi>occasionally,</hi> and <hi>by the By,</hi> as well as Those Gentlemen that <hi>Assisted</hi> more <hi>Immediately</hi> to the <hi>Attending</hi> of This <hi>Office.</hi> To say the Plain Truth of the Matter, the <hi>Surgeons</hi> had but <hi>half a sight</hi> of the <hi>Case,</hi> and <hi>Consequently,</hi> could make but <hi>half a Iudgment</hi> upon the Thing in Question. Nothing is more Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, then for <hi>Learned</hi> and <hi>Practical Physicians,</hi> upon a <hi>Consult</hi> to say, If I had known, or seen <hi>This or That Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident,</hi> I should have taken it to have been such or such a <hi>Disease</hi>; and most Undoubtedly, (as I have Hinted already) they would have made quite Another <hi>Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> upon the <hi>Body</hi> in the <hi>Ditch,</hi> then they <hi>did</hi> upon the <hi>Table.</hi> But to give as much as can be <hi>Granted,</hi> or I might have said as much as can be <hi>Demanded</hi> in the <hi>then Present state of Things</hi>; The very <hi>Conjecture,</hi> or

                     <p>There is <hi>Great Weight</hi> laid upon the <hi>Limberness,</hi> the <hi>Twisting,</hi> or the <hi>Wrenching</hi> of the <hi>Neck,</hi> as some of the <hi>Iurors</hi> have <hi>worded</hi> it; or the <hi>Dislocating</hi> of it, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Surgeons.</hi> They All spoke of <hi>Greens Twisting</hi> his <hi>Neck, says Prance,</hi> Tryal, fol. 17.] And from hence they Infer that he was <hi>strangled.</hi> Now the <hi>Fallacy</hi> of This <hi>Inference</hi> lyes so <hi>open,</hi> that Every <hi>Nurse,</hi> and <hi>Sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher</hi> here about the Town is Infinitely better able to speak to't, upon <hi>Experience,</hi> then the <hi>Whole Council of Surgeons Hall</hi> can pretend to; if they take upon them to speak only by <hi>Book.</hi>

                        <pb n="287" facs="tcp:57297:326"/>Here's not one Syllable in These Enformations that could be of any Service to the End they <hi>Were</hi> or <hi>Ought</hi> to have been taken for; Nor any Thing in them but what is either <hi>Insignificant,</hi> or <hi>Partial.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <hi>Brown</hi> the <hi>Constable</hi> was told of a Gentleman found Dead in a Ditch; He went to the Place, with Those that told him, and there found <hi>Sir Edmund Godfrey</hi> lying Dead with his Sword through his Body; and when he took him out of the Ditch, he had Not any <hi>Band</hi> about his Neck.</p>
                     <p>And why [<hi>lying Dead</hi>] with his Sword through his Body, unless to Bespeak a False Understanding of the Matter, and to Insinuate that some body else had <hi>Murther'd</hi> him; and so either Cast or Left him there? This is the Genuine Countenance of it, and No Man that looks no further into't can take it otherwise. So that here's <hi>Truth Misrepresented,</hi> the <hi>Reason</hi> of the Thing <hi>Disguis'd, Honest Men Misled</hi>; and (All at Once) <hi>Common Iustice</hi> most Notoriously Abus'd. Let a Man but lay his Hand upon his Heart Now, and set himself to compare the Naked simplicity of the True Matter, of <hi>Fact</hi> with This <hi>way</hi> of <hi>Wording</hi> the Report that is made use of to <hi>Cover</hi> it.</p>
                     <p>Here's a <hi>Body</hi> found in a <hi>Ditch,</hi> with a Wound Under the left Pap, and the Point of a Sword so many Inches through the Blade of the right Shoulder; The Right Arm stiff-stretch'd upon the Bank; the Left arm Doubled under it, and the Head leaning upon't.</p>
                     <p>VVould any Man pass the <hi>same Iudgment</hi> now upon the Death of the <hi>same Man,</hi> under the Appearance of Two so <hi>Differing Evidences?</hi> And yet they are Both upon the Credit of the <hi>same Testimony:</hi> Only the <hi>One</hi> was Calculated for the <hi>Iury,</hi> and the <hi>Other</hi> for the <hi>Truth</hi> of the <hi>Fact</hi>; which <hi>Latter Deposition</hi> we have had already. I do not say Yet that there is any <hi>Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction</hi> in This <hi>Diversity</hi>; but the <hi>Evidence</hi> is suited to

the <hi>Question:</hi> and then there's a <hi>Latitude</hi> for <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Phrases,</hi> that may seem to <hi>speak One</hi> Thing, and <hi>Import Another:</hi> As his <hi>Lying Dead in the Ditch,</hi> sounds as if he had been <hi>kill'd,</hi> and Thrown there; which is only a Cast of the <hi>Clerk's skill</hi> for the <hi>Better Colour</hi> of an <hi>Ill Bus'ness.</hi> And what's his Descanting then upon the <hi>Cleanness</hi> of his <hi>Shoes,</hi> and the <hi>Print</hi> of the <hi>Pummel</hi> of his <hi>Sword,</hi> but the Encroachment of a <hi>Witness</hi> upon the Office of a <hi>Iuror:</hi> Or effectually, VVhat's the whole <hi>Enformation</hi> but an <hi>Answer</hi> to such <hi>Leading Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions</hi> as make the <hi>Depositions</hi> look liker an <hi>Argument,</hi> then a <hi>Testimony?</hi> Now <hi>Brown</hi> Applies his <hi>Answers</hi> to the respective <hi>Interrogatories,</hi> and if he fell short, it was the <hi>Examiner</hi>'s Fault not His. And so for the taking of him up without a <hi>Band:</hi> it was Just as much to the Purpose as if he had <hi>Whistled.</hi> The single Bus'<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their <hi>Enquiry,</hi> was to Learn what <hi>Death</hi> the Justice <hi>Dy'd</hi>; and whether <hi>strangled,</hi> or <hi>not:</hi> so that All This was not One Jot to the Point, unless they would draw <hi>Inferences</hi> from the <hi>Soles</hi> of his <hi>Shoes</hi> to the <hi>Circles</hi> about his <hi>Neck.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now to an Ordinary Bodies Thinking, <hi>Brown</hi> might have been <hi>Catechiz'd</hi> upon Matters Infinitely more <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive</hi> to the <hi>Iurors</hi> then any thing that appears hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto from These Enformations. <hi>Brown</hi> could have told of the <hi>Crashing of the Sword through the Bone,</hi> the <hi>Gubbling</hi> of the <hi>Bloud</hi> that came out, and the <hi>spatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> Noise it made upon the <hi>Ground</hi> at the <hi>Drawing</hi> of it. And This was No more, then what was well Enough <hi>Known</hi> too; but for <hi>Solemnities</hi> sake, there must be somewhat upon <hi>Record</hi> Transmitted to <hi>After-Times,</hi> in <hi>Honour</hi> of the <hi>Cause,</hi> and for the <hi>Perpetual Memory</hi> of the Thing; In which Case, the <hi>Bloud,</hi> the <hi>Posture,</hi> and some other <hi>Dangerous Circumstances</hi> were found Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, by the <hi>Managers</hi> of That season, to be better <hi>Out</hi> then <hi>In.</hi>

                                 <p>SAith, That there was a <hi>Vestry</hi> held in the Parish of <hi>St. Martins in the Fields,</hi> upon the <hi>11th</hi> of <hi>Octob. 1678.</hi> being <hi>Friday,</hi> where This Enformant was present, and that a Little before the rising of the said <hi>Vestry,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Evening, <hi>Sir Edmundbury Godfrey</hi> came Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stily in, and took his Vsual Place; and as the <hi>Vestry</hi> was about to Rise, the said <hi>Sir Edmund</hi> went out of the Room, and Call'd to This <hi>Enformant</hi> to go along with him, which he did accordingly. As they were upon the Way, he told This Enformant that he fear'd he had done <hi>Harry Bradbury</hi> Wrong, and was resolv'd to <hi>Right</hi> him <hi>That Night,</hi> and so desired This Enformant to Assist

him therein. The said <hi>Sir Edmund</hi> then looking behind him, and seeing <hi>Mr. James Hemes,</hi> Another of the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry,</hi> he took him along with him, This Enformant go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing along with them to <hi>Collonel Weldens.</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>And that being come to the said Collonel's, <hi>Sir Edmund</hi> desired This Enformant to help him off with his Coat, who Minded him that the Weather was Cold: <hi>Sir Edmund</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying, However <hi>he would have it off.</hi> This Enformant help'd him off with it, and <hi>Sir Edmund</hi> then took it, and threw it on to the Window, and then went and seated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self at a Table at the Other End of the Room: This En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formant observing something <hi>Extraordinary</hi> in the <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> of the Thing; and sitting down at the same Table next to him, Ask'd him what it was that <hi>Troubled</hi> him about the said <hi>Harry Bradbury? Sir Edmund</hi> Answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that he had made <hi>Bradbury</hi> pay <hi>Forty Shillings</hi> for Another bodies Fault; and that if This Enformant would Agree to't, he should be Repay'd the <hi>Forty Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings:</hi> Whereupon, by Consent, <hi>Mr. Bradbury</hi> was sent for. And <hi>Sir Edmund</hi> did then tell This Enformant that he had some <hi>Parish-Mony</hi> in his Hand, and that he would put the said Mony into the Hands of This En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formant, (who had been lately <hi>Church-Warden,</hi> and had some Parish Accounts in his Hands) Desiring This En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formant to Pay <hi>Mr. Bradbury</hi> the <hi>Forty Shillings</hi> out of the said Mony; <hi>Sir Edmund</hi> thereupon Delivering the Mony he had in his hands, to This Enformant, who pay'd <hi>Mr. Bradbury,</hi> when he came, the <hi>Forty Shillings</hi> afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said. This Enformant hereupon said to <hi>Sir Edmund, You are in a very good Mind.</hi> Who Reply'd, <hi>Yes, I am resolv'd to settle All my Bus'ness to Night;</hi> and the Accounts shall be brought in Your Name, and Not in Mine.</p>
                                 <p>This Enformant observing that <hi>he Pass'd from One Thing to Another;</hi> Ask'd him if he had done Now? Whose Answer was, that he had not done Yet; saying



<pb n="303" facs="tcp:57297:334"/>
thereupon, that he us'd to give Ten Shillings a Week to the Poor in Bread, and that he that had Bak'd it Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto should do it No Longer; <hi>Mr. Bradbury,</hi> upon That, (being a <hi>Baker</hi>) Ask'd him if he should do it? <hi>Sir Edmund</hi> asking This Enformant what he would Advise; who told him, that he was the Master of his own Charity; <hi>Sir Edmund</hi> saying then, that <hi>Mr. Bradbury</hi> should do it, and that he <hi>Would Charge,</hi> or that he <hi>Had Charg'd</hi> it by his <hi>Will,</hi> to be paid out of the <hi>Rent</hi> of some <hi>Houses</hi> that he had in <hi>Westminster.</hi> This Enformant asking him again, <hi>Sir Edmund</hi> have you done Now? <hi>Sir Edmund</hi> saying No, I have not done Yet; for the Parish is now in My Debt, and so Reckon'd an odd Summe which This En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formant paid him upon the Place. This Enformant asked him a <hi>Third Time,</hi> if he had done Yet; <hi>Sir Edmund</hi> replying <hi>Yes:</hi> and Clapping his Hand upon his Breast, said, that <hi>Now he was at Quiet:</hi> After which, <hi>Sir Edmund</hi> rose up, and Desir'd This Enformant to Help him on with his Coat, which he did. The said <hi>Sir Edmund</hi> repeating that <hi>his Conscience was Clear.</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>And further; that as they were drinking a Glass of Beer, This Enformant Asked the said <hi>Sir Edmund, What News;</hi> Who made Answer, That <hi>in a short time, You will hear of the Death of Some-body,</hi> or the <hi>Murther,</hi> (This Enformant doth not remember which of the Two Words) <hi>Sir Edmund</hi> saying that <hi>he was Confident He Himself should be the First.</hi> Whereupon <hi>Mr. Hemes</hi> aforesaid Desired him if he fear'd any such Thing, that he would not go abroad without Company: <hi>Sir Edmund</hi> Answering, that <hi>his Conscience was Clear,</hi> that he <hi>Car'd for No Company,</hi> and that he <hi>Fear'd</hi> No Body.</p>
                                 <p>And This Enformant being Interrogated concerning the Evening of so many accounts, whether he had had any Discourse with the said Sir <hi>Edmund</hi> about Those Accounts before? He This Enformant Answereth, that there had been no such Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,



<pb n="304" facs="tcp:57297:335"/>
and that he never knew any thing of that Nature done in so sudden a manner before.</p>

                                    <hi>And further saith,</hi> That about one of the Clock on the Next Day, being <hi>Saturday,</hi> the said Sir <hi>Edmund</hi> Passing by the Door of This Enformant, He this Enformant asked him to come in, and Dine with him; but he said he was in hast, and could not stay; and so having this Enformant by the Hand, he took away his Hand, and went hastily away, speaking very earnestly, insomuch that this Enformant won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred at it, he having been usually Freer, and Easier with This Enformant.</p>
                                 <p>This Enformant referreth himself upon the Matters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in this Enformation, to the best of his Knowledge and Memory.</p>

                     <p>The Reader will find little in This Enformation to the Tune of the <hi>Pleasant, Good, Even Humour and Temper,</hi> in the Enformation before the <hi>Coroner.</hi> There's too much on't, to be <hi>Natural,</hi> and the <hi>Synony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals</hi> one upon the Neck of Another, savour more of the <hi>Skill</hi> of the <hi>Clark,</hi> then of the <hi>Faith</hi> of the <hi>Reporter.</hi> In which Case, many times there goes but the <hi>Dash</hi> of a <hi>Pen</hi> to the <hi>Mending</hi> of a <hi>Short Evidence.</hi>

                     <p>The <hi>Second Deposition</hi> of Mr. <hi>Radcliffe</hi> seems to me to have a great many Notable Passages in it. <hi>Sir E.G.</hi> had a Mind to <hi>make even with the World.</hi> The Fit took him at <hi>That Instant,</hi> and all must be done <hi>That Night. Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> was to have his <hi>Forty Shillings</hi>; The <hi>Parish Accounts</hi> to be <hi>Adjusted</hi> in All Hast; He told the Company what Care he had taken for the Continuance of his <hi>Charity: And now</hi> (says he, clapping his Hand upon his Breast)

                        <hi>I am at Quiet</hi>; Call'd for his Coat, and went over with it again; <hi>My Conscience is Clear.</hi> His <hi>Motions,</hi> and his <hi>Actions</hi> in the Room; The <hi>Vehemency</hi> of his <hi>Words</hi>; His <hi>Hudling</hi> of so many things over in such a Disorder; His <hi>Starting</hi> from one thing to Another, and all to be Dispatch'd upon That Point of Time: And then the Winding up of theConversation with a <hi>Foreboding</hi> of his <hi>Death</hi> or <hi>Murther</hi>; The Company might be well allow'd to <hi>Iudge,</hi> and to <hi>Observe,</hi> These Things Consider'd that there was somewhat very Extraordinary in his Mind.</p>
                     <p>Upon the Comparing of These Two Enformations it seems very remarkable, that the <hi>Former</hi> delivers it as the <hi>Opinion</hi> of Mr. <hi>Radcliffe,</hi> that <hi>Sir Godfrey</hi> was Last Night in <hi>a Pleasant Good Even Humour and Temper</hi>; when the <hi>Latter,</hi> in <hi>Fact,</hi> sets him forth to have been the <hi>Clean Contrary:</hi> So that the <hi>Whole Story</hi> of the <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order</hi> is not only <hi>Omitted,</hi> but Apparently <hi>Contradicted</hi> by the <hi>Other Insinuation.</hi> The Question is, How <hi>Godfrey</hi> came by his Death; and what <hi>Radcliffe</hi> could say toward the Clearing of That Matter. Now the <hi>Iury</hi> being Divided whether he Destroyed <hi>Himself,</hi> or was <hi>Murther'd</hi> by <hi>Other People,</hi> it was a thing very much to their Purpose, to Enform themselves what <hi>Humour</hi> he was in, either <hi>soon before,</hi> or <hi>upon his going away.</hi> The Question was put to <hi>Radcliffe</hi> about the seeing of him <hi>That Saturday,</hi> and what he could say further to the Matter they had before them. The <hi>Coroners Enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi> says, he verily <hi>Believes</hi> he saw him; In the <hi>Other,</hi> he <hi>Swears</hi> that he had him by the <hi>Hand,</hi> and <hi>Invited</hi> him to <hi>Dinner</hi>; Nay, and Mr. <hi>Radcliffe</hi> calls to mind that heObjected at that very Time to the <hi>Expression. Why,</hi> says he, <hi>'tis More then Believing; for I Know it</hi>: And some body made Answer, If you <hi>Know</hi> it, you <hi>Believe</hi> it. It is observable again, that there was a most Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious Separation in the Examination before the <hi>Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> of <hi>some Parts</hi> of the <hi>Story</hi> from the <hi>Rest</hi>; and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly,



<pb n="306" facs="tcp:57297:336"/>
that <hi>Those Passages were made use of, that were not one jot to the Purpose</hi>; and <hi>others left out, that in All Appearance would have given the Iurors the Best Light they had, toward the Governing of the following Verdict.</hi> What was the <hi>Account,</hi> or <hi>Discount</hi> among the <hi>Parish-Officers</hi> to the <hi>Question</hi> of <hi>Felo de se,</hi> or <hi>Not?</hi> That Account, Barely, I mean, without <hi>Godfrey's Part</hi> in the <hi>Disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly Circumstances</hi> that <hi>Attended</hi> it. The <hi>Charge</hi> and <hi>Discharge,</hi> of it self, was utterly <hi>Impertinent</hi>; but the <hi>Other</hi> could not be well <hi>Vnderstood,</hi> but in Company with the <hi>Relation</hi> it had to the Bus'ness of the <hi>Reck'nings, Bradbury's Forty Shillings</hi>; The <hi>Setling</hi> of his <hi>Charity</hi>; And All must be Finished <hi>That Night</hi> too; which seems to Imply an Apprehension he had, that he should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Live</hi> to <hi>Another Opportunity</hi> of doing it. Now <hi>This</hi> was the <hi>Point</hi> that should have been <hi>Pressed, Inculcated,</hi> and <hi>Insisted</hi> upon; and it would have done much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to have lay'd the <hi>Fact</hi> at <hi>Length</hi> before the <hi>Iury,</hi> without any <hi>Gloss</hi> upon't, on the <hi>One</hi> Hand, then to Deliver a <hi>Partial,</hi> and an <hi>Vngrounded Opinion,</hi> without so much as one Syllable of the Plain <hi>Truth of Fact,</hi> on the <hi>Other.</hi> The whole Matter under Deliberation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves shortly in to <hi>This</hi>; Was Sir <hi>Godfrey</hi> under any <hi>Trouble,</hi> and <hi>Distress</hi> of <hi>Thought,</hi> or <hi>Not?</hi> This is the <hi>Truth</hi> of the <hi>Story,</hi> says the <hi>One</hi> Side; And let the <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors</hi> Judge upon't whether he <hi>Was,</hi> or <hi>No.</hi> Now the Other side is for giving the <hi>Opinion,</hi> without the <hi>Story</hi>; And it was Prudently done; for the <hi>Naked Narrative</hi> of the <hi>Fact,</hi> and That Judgment of his <hi>Even Humour</hi> could never have stood together.</p>
                     <p>I was affraid least this Diversity of Countenance from the same Person, might prove Injurious, either to the Cause, or to the <hi>Witness,</hi> if I should let it go off Thus without something of an <hi>Explanatory Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version</hi> upon it: Wherefore I communicated the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to Mr. <hi>Radcliffe Himself,</hi> who told me that he would

suddenly give me a Plain Account of the Whole Affair; and I received from him in his own <hi>Hand-Writing</hi> the <hi>Declaratory Enformation</hi> here following upon That Subject.</p>

                                 <p>He came through the House to this Enformant in a very <hi>Unusual Manner;</hi> And this <hi>Enformant</hi> observ'd such Signs of <hi>Trouble,</hi> and <hi>Discontent</hi> in him, that it made this Enformant at that present very much wonder what should be the <hi>meaning</hi> of it.</p>

                                    <hi>And saith,</hi> That the said Sir <hi>Edmund</hi> went his way (as this Enformant believes) to the <hi>Vestry;</hi> and about an hour after, one came to this Enformant, telling him, that the said Sir <hi>Edmund</hi> and <hi>Mr. Radcliffe</hi> desired to see him at <hi>Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel Weldens,</hi> whether this Enformant went, and there found Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey, Mr. Radcliffe,</hi> and <hi>Mr. Hemes;</hi> and then the said Sir <hi>Edmund</hi> and <hi>Mr. Radcliffe</hi> set all the Accounts right before spoken of.</p>
                                 <p>This <hi>Enformant</hi> was there (as he believeth) an Hour or two in the Company; and remembereth very well that he appeared to this Enformant in very <hi>Great Disorder</hi> still, and rather <hi>worse</hi> then at the House of this <hi>Enformant;</hi> the said Sir <hi>Edmund</hi> desiring <hi>Mr. Radcliffe,</hi> upon his going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, to <hi>Help him on with his Coat.</hi>

                        <p>The Opening of the Body had certainly Discover'd the Cause of Sir <hi>E. B. G.</hi>'s Death: And it was Advis'd and Propounded by Doctors, Friends, and Surgeons, but Rejected.</p>

                     <p>There was one General Rule to Walk by, which was to <hi>make every Man a Papist,</hi> that <hi>Cross'd</hi> the <hi>Designs</hi> of the <hi>Then Prevailing Faction</hi>; and after the Fastning of That <hi>Brand</hi> upon him, it was but the <hi>Lip-Labour of Kis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing a Book</hi> to <hi>Swear</hi> him into a <hi>Traytor</hi>; for they <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd</hi> their <hi>Treasons,</hi> as <hi>Dyers</hi> do their <hi>Colours</hi>; that

has not been so much as <hi>One Question put</hi> about his <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy,</hi> on the <hi>One Hand</hi>; Nor <hi>One Syllable</hi> of <hi>Enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation concerning that Melancholy</hi> that has not been <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenanced</hi>; And (if not Punished) at Least, <hi>Ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cul'd,</hi> on the <hi>Other.</hi> Now to <hi>Conclude,</hi> If <hi>These Two Points, well-prov'd,</hi> would have brought it to a <hi>Clear Issue</hi>; it is, <hi>beyond all Controversie,</hi> that the <hi>Bloud</hi> has been <hi>made out</hi> past <hi>Contradiction</hi> already; and that what These People could have said, to the <hi>Evidencing</hi> of a <hi>deep,</hi> and a <hi>dangerous Discontent,</hi> would have as <hi>Amply</hi> made out the <hi>Other</hi>: These Things they did <hi>Certainly</hi> KNOW, and <hi>Would not Know</hi>; and <hi>This</hi> was the <hi>Blindness,</hi> undoubtedly, of those that <hi>Would Not see.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I have here Discharged my <hi>Conscience,</hi> and my <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> with a most Affectionate, and Impartial Respect to <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>Iustice</hi>; And I have done it according to the Best of my <hi>Skill,</hi> and <hi>Vnderstanding</hi>; without Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying any <hi>Passion,</hi> or <hi>Interest</hi>; and without Leaning either to the <hi>Right</hi> Hand, or to the <hi>Left</hi>; as I shall Answer for't at the Last Day.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Two Main Points</hi> in the Case of This Discourse, are <hi>These: First,</hi> Was <hi>Sir E. B. Godfrey Murther'd</hi> at <hi>Somerset-House,</hi> according to the <hi>Evidence</hi> of <hi>Bedloe</hi> and <hi>Prance,</hi> or was he <hi>Not?</hi> Whoever <hi>says,</hi> or <hi>thinks</hi> he <hi>Was,</hi> must Remove <hi>Forty Contradictions</hi> and <hi>Impossibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities</hi> out of the way, before any <hi>Man</hi> can pretend to <hi>Believe</hi> it. If he was <hi>Not,</hi> there's the <hi>Bloud</hi> of <hi>Three Innocent Men</hi> to <hi>Answer</hi> for, that was <hi>Shed</hi> upon <hi>That Perjury.</hi> Now if he <hi>Was</hi> again, There's the <hi>King,</hi> the <hi>Queen Consort,</hi> that then was, and now <hi>Queen Dowager,</hi> the Lord <hi>Bellassis,</hi> &amp;c. These were All <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly</hi> in't; but then by <hi>Complication,</hi> and <hi>Confederacy:</hi> Whoever was in the <hi>Plot,</hi> was more or less a Friend to the <hi>Murther</hi>; And <hi>Bedloe Swears</hi> that <hi>Every conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Papist in</hi> England <hi>was under an Oath of Secrecy to



<pb n="332" facs="tcp:57297:349"/>
Conceal it.</hi> But once again now; If he was <hi>Not Murther'd</hi> there, as they swore he <hi>Was;</hi> What <hi>Repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> for the <hi>Honour</hi> of so many <hi>Illustrious Names</hi> as will be deliver'd over to <hi>After-Ages</hi> in <hi>Depositions, Iournals,</hi> and other <hi>Records,</hi> under the <hi>Blot</hi> of This <hi>Infamy?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To Obviate <hi>These Two Questions,</hi> I have Divided This Tract into <hi>Two Parts.</hi> In the <hi>Former,</hi> the <hi>Forgery</hi> is layd so <hi>Open,</hi> that I dare Defie the History of the whole World, to produce <hi>Any One Cause,</hi> where-ever a <hi>False Oath Impos'd</hi> an <hi>Abuse</hi> upon a <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Iustice,</hi> which was <hi>Afterward</hi> so <hi>Vnanswerably Disprov'd,</hi> and by so many several <hi>Ways.</hi> The <hi>First Part,</hi> in short, Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges <hi>Somerset-House</hi> of the <hi>Murther.</hi> The Question of the <hi>Second,</hi> is, <hi>Felo de se, or Not?</hi> And if Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Iones's [Circumstances] and [Concurrent Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies.] Greens Tryal, pag.</hi> 72. may but pass for as Good Evidence on the Behalf of <hi>Truth,</hi> as for the <hi>Support</hi> of an <hi>Imposture,</hi> the <hi>Felo de se</hi> is much clearer in <hi>This Case,</hi> then the <hi>Popish Murther</hi> was in the <hi>Other.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I have not pass'd over Any Thing hitherto, that I found worth a Notice; but in regard that Men that have <hi>Least</hi> to say, are apt to make the <hi>Most</hi> of a Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle; and that there are yet remaining <hi>Vntouch'd</hi> some <hi>Popular Stories,</hi> that have obtained among the <hi>Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude:</hi> I shall Subjoyn an <hi>Appendix,</hi> upon <hi>Those Points</hi> to what I have said Already, and so <hi>Conclude.</hi>

                     <p>The <hi>Staffordshire Letter of Intelligence</hi> about the Death of Sir <hi>E. B.

was <hi>This: The Body was not found till</hi> Thursday <hi>the</hi> 17<hi>th.
