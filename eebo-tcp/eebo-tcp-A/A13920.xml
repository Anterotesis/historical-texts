            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT was trulye and wiſelie ſaied of the poete, that one witnes, whiche hathe ſeen the thinge with his eyes, is more to be ſet bye, then tene of reporte.

For clearer is the water at the ſpringe, then far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of in the ryuer. but wherunto ſerueth this: Herunto gentle rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.

            <head>The. 1. Chapter.</head>
            <p>PUrpoſing playnly &amp; brefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſpeake of the true iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying of a Chriſtian ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and aſwell of vpright true good workes, as the maner and fourme therof: I mynde not to tell what diſputacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue had of the ſame, but what God (who cannot lye) hath vttered &amp; ſpoken therof in his worde. This matter of iuſtificacion I thought to ſerue my turne: Firſt beecauſe that Iohn the Apoſtle and Eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt, whom I now haue in ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d doth in maner treate wholy ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>of. Upon whom I was perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to make the better declaraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb facs="tcp:2167:11"/>
if I aforehande out of all the ſcripture ſet a ſhort Summe of iu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtificacion and of good workes. Secondly, beecauſe that in oure fayth and religion there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng, wherof we may be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rante with greater hurte, or that with greater profit may be kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen, perceaued and vnderſtand, then euen the maner of iuſtificaci<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on and of good workes. For iuſti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ficacion is the ſureſt ground and eſtabliſhment of our life &amp; well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, becauſe this matter (beyng els playne and euydent) is now in our dayes, thorow the many folde darke myſtes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencious men, vtterly confuſed &amp; cleane toſſed out of order. For, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cerning iuſtificacion, diuerſe and ſondrye men haue ſtraunge and nyce opinions. Some ſaye ſtyl, that the faythfull are iuſtifyed
<pb facs="tcp:2167:11"/>
thorowe the onelye belefe in the Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, whiche is a trueth in dede.</p>
            <p>Other there be, that refuſe &amp; condemne thys as an erroneous opynyon, but with great arroga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cye aſcribe their iuſtificacyon vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to mens works. Some referre iu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtificacion to faith and workes a lyke. And ſome there be, that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to fayth aſcrybe the begynnynge of iuſtificacion, and the finiſhi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge or perfourmaunce thereof vnto workes. Yet haue I not recyted the myndes and opinions of all. But foraſmuche as there is ſuch contencion among the learned, the peoples conſciences are ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by vexed, troubled and ſore te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>Wherefore to eſtabliſhe the Chriſtian verite, and for an intro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>duction into the holy and godlye goſpell of Iohn: I mynde to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leete
<pb facs="tcp:2167:12"/>
&amp; gather together a ſhorte Summe of the iuſtificacion of a Chriſtyan manne, and concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng good workes. Nether will I here bring forth eny thinge at all, which I do not declare and proue wyth ſenſible playne teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of gods ſcripture: yea and as touchinge iuſtificacion and good workes, I wil collecte &amp; conferre together nothing els, but the moſt euident witneſſes of the ſcripture. So that without the order and homelie vnpainted oracion, ther ſhalbe nothig mine: nether wil I compte any thinge mine own but trye &amp; proue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together by gods word.

            <head>¶ Afore al things it ſhalbe nedefull, to ſette forth a ſure deſcription, expoſicion and ſignificacion of this terme iuſtifieng.</head>
            <head>The. 2. Chapter.</head>
            <p>TO iuſtifie, or this terme, Iuſtifie is in the ſcriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re taken ſondrie waies. For ſomtyme it ſignifieth to aſcribe honour and right vnto god, to yelde vnto him: ſtowtlie &amp; boldly to confeſſe, that he one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie is rightuous, but we oure ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues ſynners and vniuſt. Thus is it red: And all the people and the <note place="margin">Luke. 7.</note> publicanes, that heard him, iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied god, and were baptiſed &amp; the baptiſine of Ihon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:2167:13"/>
More ouer, it ſignifieth aſmuch, as to defende and ſpare himſelf, and to ſet forth himſelfe for iuſt and ryghteous. For ſo the Lorde vſeth it whan he rebuketh y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>riſees, Luke. 16. ſaying vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Ye are they, that iuſtifie youre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelues <note place="margin">Luke. 16.</note> beefore men, but god kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth your hartes.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding in this our preſent matter, I vſe thys terme (Iuſtifie) as the cuſtome is in cauſes iudicial and belonging to the law. And ſo doeth it betoken aſmuche, as to pronounce hym iuſt and righteous, that is, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>charge from punyſhment, and by ſentence to cleare and quite him free, whiche is accuſed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to haue execucion. Againe contrary vnto thys doth the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture now ſet that, whyche is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to pollute or ſtayne: that is, by ſentence to pronounce one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed,
<pb facs="tcp:2167:13"/>
vngodly, vnrighteous and worthye to bee plaged, and ſo to geue hym ouer to be puniſhed.</p>
            <p>For it is red thus: If there be <note place="margin">Deu. 25.</note> a ſtrife betwene men, they ſhall come to the law: and let y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iudges geue ſentence betwene them, and iuſtifie the rightuous, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne the vngodly. What canne thys be els, but euen aſmuche as to ſaye: Let them diſcharge and quite free the rightuous, &amp; iudge the vnrightuous to be puniſhed. For Eſaye in the fift Chapter ſai<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eth <note place="margin">Eſay. 5.</note> yet more playnlye thus: they iuſtifie the vngodly for rewards ſake, but condemne the iuſt cauſe of the ryghteous.</p>
            <p>Which is euen aſmuch to ſay as: the righteous doe not they de clare to be righteous, neyther de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyuer they hym from the vilanye and wrong of the vniuſt: but take rewardes and giftes, and leaue
<pb facs="tcp:2167:14"/>
him to the wilfulnes of violent oppreſſours. Here vnto ſerueth it that is writte in the prouerbes of Salomon the 17. chapter: The <note place="margin">Pro. 17.</note> lorde hateth aſwel him that iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth the vngodlie, as him that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demneth the innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Item that, out of the. 12. of Matthew: Out of thy wordes thou ſhalt be iuſti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fied, <note place="margin">Math. 12.</note> and out of thy wordes thou ſhalte be condemned.</p>
            <p>Of the worde Iuſtifie, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth the worde iuſtificacion or iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieng. <note place="margin">Iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion.</note> And the ſame is a iudicial terme in the ſcripture. For iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacion is the declaracion of the iudge, who pronounceth ſentence for the accuſed: that is, diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth and quyteth him free from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> accuſacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and threatned puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Iuſtificacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> therfore is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els, but a diſcharge, dely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraunce and reſtitucion from death to life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:2167:14"/>
Herof is rightuouſnes called a diſcharge and pardon fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne: And they be the rightuous, whoſe ſynnes are forgeuen, and which, beyng a quyted fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> death, are become hieres of eternal life. The Apoſtle Paul therfore, more <note place="margin">Iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion &amp; rede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pcion.</note> then in one place, doth expounde Iuſtificacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name of rede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion &amp; remiſſion of ſynnes: For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which cauſe he ſetteth them both together, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> one maie be vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded bi a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>other. For in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Acts of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apoſtles he ſaieth: Be it knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto you therfore, ye men &amp; bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, <note place="margin">Actes. 13.</note> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thorow this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (namely Chriſt) is preached vnto you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geuenes of ſynnes, and that by him all, that beleue, are iuſtified fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al things, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which you could not be iuſtified by the lawe of Moſes. And to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Romanes he <note place="margin">Roma. 4.</note> ſaieth: euen as Dauid alſo deſcry<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>beth the ſaluacion of that man,
<pb facs="tcp:2167:15"/>
vnto whom god imputeth righte ouſnes wythout workes. Bleſſed <note place="margin">Pſal. 32.</note> are they (ſaieth he) whoſe vnrigh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teouſneſſes are forgeuen, and whoſe ſynnes are couered. Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is that man, vnto whom the Lorde wyll not impute ſynne.</p>
            <p>Behold now, how he ioyneth and knytteth iuſtificacion, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedfulnes (or ſaluacion) and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myſſyon of ſynnes together. So doeth Eſaye alſo in maner wyth <note place="margin">Eſay. 53.</note> more playne wordes in the. 53. Chapter, ſaying: my ryghtuous ſeruaunte ſhall with his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge (or with the knowledge of him) iuſtifie the multitude: for he ſhall beare away theyr ſynnes. For thys laſt: he ſhal beare away their ſinnes: doeth in maner ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound that, whych goeth before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyth hys knowledge, or wyth the knowledge of hym, ſhal he iu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtifie and deliuer the multitude.
<pb facs="tcp:2167:15"/>
Thus he declareth, that iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cyon is nothyng els but remyſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſinnes. For whan the lorde taketh away our wyckednes, he iu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtifieth vs.</p>
            <p>To iuſtifye therefore and to beare ſynne away, to delyuer fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſynne or to forgeue ſynne, is all one matter. So that we lack now no more but to ſay: iuſtyfycacion is the remiſſion of ſynnes &amp; the diſcharge from damnacyon, the deliuerance, I ſaye, and forgeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of ſynne: yea euen the recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing vp of a ſinner into the grace of god, and inherytaunce of lyfe. Wherfore whan the queſtyon is <note place="margin">The forme faſhio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and maner of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mediacyon and iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cacion.</note> aſked concernyng the true iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cacyon of man: vndoubtedly it is demaunded, what that maye be, for whoſe ſake or by who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſinners are diſcharged fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the threatned and deſerued death, or by whoſe meanes our ſynnes are forgeuen

vs. Or: Wherein is the worlde reconcyled with god: And ſo in thes poynts conſiſteth the whole knowledge of our iuſtificacion, that whan we haue knowne the mediatour &amp; redemer, the fourm and maner of the redempcion, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faſhion and meane alſo wherby the delyueraunce co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth vnto vs &amp; is geuen vs: the iuſtificacion of a Chriſtian ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may lykewiſe be vnderſtande.</p>

Then wil I ſhewe, how we beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e partakers of this righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſnes. For in this mater muſt ſpeciall reſpect be had to theſe two poyntes: Namely, who is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mediator &amp; redemer of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> damned &amp; how he hath delyuered the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is, after what ſorte we become pertakers of the redempcion and

iuſtificacion, or how the deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance extendeth to our commodi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>te and welfare. To ſpeake of the fyrſt, imagen thou nowe by thy ſelf, that god, the righteous iudge of all, ſitteth vpon hys iudycyall Throne, before who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſtand al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and before accuſed as vngodlye and vnfaythfull, ſtayned and de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fyled wyth al vyces, and are con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uicte of the ſame, by mea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>es wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>of, the ſentence of condemnacion is called for and required.

Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheles in thys greateſt and fi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nal daunger, there appeareth to the moſt woofull mankynde, an exceadyng great hope: namelye the eternall ſonne of god, who to

be arbiter &amp; mediatoure betwene god and man, and to delyuer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from deſtruction, that were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned vnto death: tooke oure fleſhe vpon hym, and became ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man, to the entente that he, be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ynge tormented and ſufferynge death, might alſo lade our ſinnes vpon hym, and wyth hys inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent death to take away our gyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines, purginge our ſinnes with his bloud, and making vs heires of eternall lyfe.</p>
            <p>Wyth thys enſample, I think it euidently inough vttered and declared, what the mediatour is and what is iuſtificacion. I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe alſo, euery man doeth well perceaue and vnderſtande, that Chryſt the mediatour, and the in carnacyon wyth the croſſe of the Lord Ieſu, is eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſame right principall poynt and only cauſe, wherby we are iuſtified &amp; made

WHat the workes of mans nature be (namelie y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes that are done by ſuch, as are not yet regenerate) the lord him ſelfe in the goſpell declareth, &amp; ſaieth: That, whiche is borne of fleſh, is fleſh.

Herof might I bring forth many recordes. Yet will I alledge onelie two. Firſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> let Iob, the moſt faithful ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunt of god, come forth: For him <note place="margin">Iob. 1.</note> hath the godlie ſentence co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and praiſed vnto vs, that he
<pb facs="tcp:2167:42"/>
was a perfecte &amp; iuſt man, ſuch one as feared god, and eſchued euil and that there was none lyke him vpon erth. And yet the ſame man, being with ſo excellent a ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell of rightuouſnes commended vnto vs, doth ſaie: If I wil iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie myſelfe, myne owne mouth <note place="margin">Iob. 9.</note> ſhal condemne me. Yf I will put forth myſelfe for a perfecte ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he ſhal proue me a wicked doer. And agayn: Yf I haue done wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly, <note place="margin">Iob. 10.</note> wo vnto me. And though I haue do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e rightuouſlie, yet dare I not lifte vp my head. Therfore is it certayne, that this moſt holy and iuſt man dyd aſcribe nothing to the frutes of his owne rightu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes, but truſted onely vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mercy of god. Now let the other witnes come forth, euen Paul y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apoſtel, who ſaieth with ſenſible wordes: I delyte in the lawe of god after the inwarde man: But <note place="margin">Roma. 7.</note>
               <pb facs="tcp:2167:43"/>
in my membre I ſe another law, which rebellein againſt the law of my mynde and ſubdueth me to the lawe of ſynne, which is in my membres. The holie Apoſtle ſpea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>king of himſelfe, and of all ſuch as be regenerate, teſtifieth, that in them abyde ſtil y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> remnauntes of the fleſhe: by the nature, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and force wherof, it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to pas thorow out the wholle life of man, that thei alſo do the thing which they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues wolde not: And therfore are thei neuer able to attayne and come to true per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectnes, ſo long as thei lyue vpon erth and in this fleſh.</p>
            <p>For aſmuch then as it is ſo, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man ſeith wel, that iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacion is not to be imputed vnto the workes of faith or of ſuch as be regenerate, conſydering that it muſt be athinge moſt pure and thorowly perfecte, wherby god
<pb facs="tcp:2167:43"/>
is pacified and pleaſed with vs. Yea the ſcripture geueth euident witneſſe, that eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Abraham, the <note place="margin">Abraham.</note> father of all faithfull beleuers, was not iuſtified by the workes of faith. Herof then maie we be bolde to conclude, that we alſo by no workes of faith are iuſtified. For thus Paul argueth: yf Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were iuſtified by workes, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <note place="margin">Roma. 4.</note> hath he wherof to reioyce, but not with god. But what ſaieth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſcripture: Abraham beleued god, and it was compted vnto him for rightuouſnes. To him that goeth aboute with workes, is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde not rekened of grace, but of duetie. To him that goeth not aboute with workes, but beleueth on him that iuſtifieth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vngodly, is his faith co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted for rightuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. Where as we now by the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we muſt be iuſtified in ſuch like pure
<pb facs="tcp:2167:44"/>
maner as he was, we ſpeke it not of our owne ymaginacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but out of the wordes of S.

wil I now declare and proue the ſame by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> nature of iuſtificacion. The right propertie, natural ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and power of iuſtificacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is to pacifie, to ſtil and quiete the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſcience, which heretofore, by the remembring and conſidering of ſynne and damnacion, was vexed and troubled. For Paul ſaieth: Becauſe therfore that we be iuſti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fied &amp; made rightuous by faith, we haue peace with god thorow <note place="margin">Roma. 5.</note> oure lorde Ieſus Chriſt.

Specially ſeye<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g that Salomo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the wiſeſt among al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <note place="margin">Pro. 20.</note>

Wherfore yf oure workes quiete not the conſcience, then do not thei in eny wiſe iuſtifie a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But faith iuſtifieth and perfectly ſtilleth the conſcience.

<pb facs="tcp:2167:46"/>
thoſe he condemneth, and turneth himſelf from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Here vnto ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> parable or ſymilitude out of the goſpel, concernyng the two that wente vp together in to the <note place="margin">Luke. 18.</note> temple to praie: Of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the one boaſted of his good workes, told what thei were, truſted vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; ſet out himſelf for a rightuous and good man. As for the other, he truſted in the onelye mercy of god, &amp; nothing at all in his owne merites, but cryed: O god, be mer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cyfull vnto me ſynner. This man wente downe, out of the temple, iuſtified: but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> other, being wrapt and ſnared in ſynne, failed of his hope. Therfore in the prophet Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remye hath the lorde geuen vs a right good counſail, &amp; ſaide: Let <note place="margin">Ieremi. 9.</note> not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wiſe man reioyce in his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, nether the ſtrong man in his ſtrength, nor the riche man in his riches: but who ſo wilreioice,
<pb facs="tcp:2167:46"/>
let him reioyce in this, that he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandeth &amp; knoweth me. For I am the lorde y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> do mercy, equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and rightuouſnes vpon earth. This counſaill dyd the godlie A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle Paul folowe, ſaieng: God forbyd that I ſhulde reioyce, ſaue <note place="margin">Gala. 6.</note> onelye in the croſſe of our lorde Ieſus Chriſt, wherby the world is crucified vnto me, and I vnto the world: For in the goſpell alſo the lorde ſaid: whan ye haue done <note place="margin">Luke. 17.</note> all that is commaunded you, ſaie: we are vnprofitable ſeruauntes, we haue not done that we ought to do. Therfore the godlie praiſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> grace of god, not bragginge of their owne merites, nether truſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting eny thing at all vnto them, <note place="margin">The righte ouſnes of fayth and workes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree not to gether.</note> but comforte them ſelues in the mercie of god.</p>
            <p>Finally, yf we now compare both the rightuouſneſſe (namelie of faith and of workes) the one
<pb facs="tcp:2167:47"/>
againſt the other, we maie eaſely perceaue that theſe beynge moſt vnlike maie not ſtand together. For as concernyng the rightuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of workes, the holie Apoſtle Paul hath ſpoken: Thorow the <note place="margin">Roma. 3. Gala. 2.</note> workes of the lawe ſhall no fleſhe be iuſtified before god. But of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rightuouſnes of faith he ſaieth thus: Al thei are iuſtified that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue. And in another place he ſai<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eth: The rightuouſnes of faith is <note place="margin">Roma. 4.</note> imputed of grace or fauour: but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rightuouſnes of works is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted of grace or fauour, but of dewti. And againe he ſaieth: Iſra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>el, which folowed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſnes, coulde not attayne to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

And immediatly geueth he a reaſon of the fyrſt
<pb facs="tcp:2167:47"/>
pointe, and addeth therto: Where<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore? Euen becauſe thei ſought it not by faith, but as by the workes of the lawe: for thei ſtombled at the ſtombling ſtone. Therfore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayneth it ſtil true and certayne, that the one rightuouſnes ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throweth the other: And therfore we that teach, a manne to be iuſti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fied by faith in the lorde Ieſus, &amp; not by workes, do not peruerte y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Chriſtian faith, as our aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ſhamfully belye vs: But thei rather do ouerthrowe it, that by all meanes and waies myniſhe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> honour of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faith in Chriſt: main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teinyng, that the churche or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregacion of the faithfull ar, by the workes &amp; merites of men, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued from ſynne, delyuered from damnacion, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne the inheritau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of eternall life.</p>

Vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name or terme, I do not much paſſe. for (as euery man knoweth) there be euil and vnprofitable workes, workes of iniquitie &amp; wickednes, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doers wherof are called the workers of wickednes. The ſame workes alſo are called the workes of the fleſhe and the workes of darknes. Agayne there be good workes, contrarie to the other, which the ſcripture calleth the works of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taunce, the frutes of the ſprete and of light: ſuch are the offices and dueties of frendſhip a loue, which wer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Tabitha, of
<pb facs="tcp:2167:50"/>
whom it is ſaid, that ſhe was full of good workes.</p>
            <p>Now wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we deſcrybe them, we ſaie: thei be ſuch as are done by thoſe, that ar borne a new, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, <note place="margin">Good workes</note> out of the good ſprete of god, by faith, &amp; acording to gods word, to the praiſe and honour of god, to the honeſt bewtifulnes of life, and finallie to the profite &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> neighbour. Theſe are ſhorte wordes, and therefore peraduenture vnto ſome thei be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> darker and more hard to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande: But yf the grace of god ſhewe vs light, thei ſhal, by the de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>claracion folowinge, be playnlie and eaſelie perceaued. No other fountayne of good workes can I ſhewe, then onelie god himſelfe. For the prophet ſaith: All men are lyars, onelie god is true. And the lorde ſaieth in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> goſpel: There <note place="margin">Pſal. 116. Math. 19.</note> is no man good, but onelie god.
<pb facs="tcp:2167:50"/>
Therfore is it neceſſary, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> good workes ſpringe not of man, who is a lyar, wicked and naught, but of god himſelfe, of whom procea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deth all that good is.</p>
            <p>Neuertheles it behoueth ſuch men, as by the ſprete of god and faith in the lorde Ieſus are rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, that thei hence forth work not their owne, namelie carnall workes, but the workes of god. For the works of thoſe, that be re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>generate, growe and ſpryng of gods good ſprete, dwelling with in them: which ſprete, as the ſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe of life, geueth ſtrength to the trees, that thei maie bring forth frute: Eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo makth he multituds of ſondrie vertues to ſpringe and growe oute of man, As the lorde himſelfe teſtifieth and ſaieth: I am the vyne, ye are y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> braunches. <note place="margin">Iohn. 15.</note> Like as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> braunche can not bring forth frute of it ſelfe, excepte it

            <p>And thus (I ſai) y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good works, that be done, are done by faith.

Moreo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uer, this knot maye be loſed thus. The moſt naturall work of fayth is purifieng or ſanctifieng. For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy Apoſtle Peter ſaith expreſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, thorow fayth ar y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heartes puri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fied. Now in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mater of ſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ctifie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g doth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy ſcripture declare two thynges: The firſt, that as manye of vs, as beeleue, are freelye ſanc|
<pb facs="tcp:2167:62"/>
tified by the bloude of Iheſus Chriſt. For S. Peter ſaieth: we <note place="margin">1, Pet, 1,</note> are electe thorow ſanctifieng of the ſprete, in the obedience and ſprinklinge of the bloud of Ieſus Chriſt. And yet more playnlie: Ye know, that ye are not redemed with tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſitory ſiluer or golde fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> youre vayne conuerſacion of the tradicions of the fathers: but w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the precious bloude of chriſt, as of the innocent vndefyled lambe. Paul alſo ſaieth: By the wil of god we are made holie, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the <note place="margin">Heb, 10,</note> offring of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body of Ieſus chriſt once for all. For (as it foloweth immediatly after) with one obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion hath he made perfecte fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer them, that are ſanctified. The Apoſtle Ihon likewiſe teſtifieth the ſame, and ſaieth: The bloude of Ieſus Chriſt, the ſonne of god, <note place="margin">1, Iohn, 1,</note> clenſeth vs from all ſynne. And thus faith in the bloude of Ieſus
<pb facs="tcp:2167:62"/>
Chriſt verelye and naturally ſane<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tifieth or makth holy, by y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> meanes of him that ſayde: I ſanctifie my ſelf for them, that thei alſo maie <note place="margin">Iohn. 17.</note> be ſanctified in the trueth.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing, that holye ſcripture declareth in the mater of ſanctifie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, is this: Namelie, that thei, which thorow faith are ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified with the bloud of Chriſt, do daily ſanctifie them ſelues, &amp; applie them vnto holyneſſe. And to this end, in my iudgment, doth a good parte of the exhortacions of the Apoſtles ſerue. Verely S. Peter <note place="margin">1. Pete. 1,</note> ſaieth: Lyke as he which hath called you is holy, euen ſo be ye holye alſo in all your conuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, according as it is writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: Be ye holy, for I am holye. And the holie Apoſtel Paul ſaieth: This is the wil of god, euen your ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificacion, <note place="margin">1, Theſ. 4,</note> that ye refrayne from whordome, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> euery one knowe,
<pb facs="tcp:2167:63"/>
how to kep his veſſel in holyneſſe and honour, not in fleſhlie luſt, as do the Heithen which knowe not god. And that no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> oppreſſe or defraude his brother in bargai<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nyng. Thus dyd Ihon alſo the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle teach &amp; ſaie: We are now gods children, and as yet it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth not what we ſhalbe. But we know, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he appeareth, we ſhalbe lyke him: for we ſhal ſe him as he is. And euery one that hath this hope in him, purifieth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, like as he alſo is pure. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this our purifie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, which is done by our care and dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, hath alſo the name of ſanctifieng, not becauſe of it ſelfe, but for the fyrſt purifieng ſake that goeth be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore: which yf it go not before, then is our ſanctifienge nothinge worth. Againe, yf the ſame go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore then muſt this alſo folow af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. For right well &amp; trulie ſaieth
<pb facs="tcp:2167:63"/>
S. Iames the Apoſtle: Faith, yf it haue no workes, is deed in it ſelfe. In it ſelfe, or for it ſelfe, I ſaie, that is: It alone, and frute<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ful with no good woorkes. For as the body w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſprite is deed, ſo faith alſo w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out works is deed.</p>
            <p>Doubtles a lyuing body doeth &amp; worketh ſomewhat, and ſerueth many: likewiſe faith, by deutie &amp; offices of loue, muſt be profitable &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modious vnto many. Now yf faith do good to no man with godlie workes, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is it an emptie ymaginacion &amp; vayne name. As alſo the ſanctifieng of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yf it do not breake forth &amp; ſhew it ſelfe in holy words and workes, aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is to be reputed falſe, feyned and full of ypocriſie. Beſydes this, all that belongeth vnto true holynes in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our ſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ctifieng, which appeareth in our workes, muſt be referred to the ſanctifie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g done by

AND knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is, that the Apoſtles of the lorde dyd ſtryue with two ſortes of people: the one ſorte aſcry<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bed rightuouſnes and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uacion to their own good works, which were done after the meſure and rule of gods lawe, &amp; therfore they deſpyced Chriſt.

Againſt the vngodlie opynio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of theſe, dyd the holie Apoſtles teach (and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially S. Paul) that rightuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and life is obteyned by faith in the lorde Ieſus, and not by our workes. The ſame Paul ſaieth to the Galathians: I refuſe not the grace of god. For yf rightuouſnes come by the law, then dyed chriſt in vayne. And agayne: Chriſt pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fiteth you nothing. And: ye are

gone quyte from Chriſt, and are fallen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> grace, yf ye wil be iuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by the lawe. Againſt ſuch alſo was kepte at Hieruſalem the Counſail that Luke maketh men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of in the Actes of the Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les.</p>
            <p>There were agayne certayne other light &amp; euell diſpoſed peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that abuſed ſuche doctryne of the Apoſtles to the libertye and ſenſualitie of the fleſh: thinking it ſufficient to ſaluacion, whan they beaſted themſelues of faith, although there were no good workes found in them. Therfore againſt thoſe, as againſt the very peſtilence and decaye of true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and gods ſeruice, dyd the ſame Apoſtles alſo ſtryue, and taught that the Chriſtian fayth was not a vayne opynio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or frute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe knowledge, but a lyuelie &amp; ſtronge confidence, moſt fruteful

And Peter the Apoſtle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buketh ſuch diſſemblers, but ſom what more darkly, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſaieth: Herevnto geue all diligence, that <note place="margin">2.

And therfore haue we the workes of rightuouſnes euen of him, of whom faith itſelf co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth. The iuſt ſhall lyue by his faith. Out of S.

            <p>Wherfore out of all this it is playne, that we do not reiecte nor withſtand vpright good workes,

whan we refuſe the workes of monckes, freres &amp; popiſh prieſts, whiche proceade of the election and good intent of man, without gods worde. For now is it more certayne, that they of a trueth are not good workes, which we yma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen of our ſelues, but onelye ſuch as god hath commaunded vs. Which thing is yet more euident out of the wordes of S.

Here ſetteth he two marks or euident toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of good workes. The firſt: we are created thorow Chriſt Ieſus vnto good workes. A good worke then muſt be done by ſuch one, as is created thorow Chriſt, or graffed in Chriſt Ieſu. For yf the braunche abyd not in the vyne, it can not bring frute.
<pb facs="tcp:2167:74"/>
By faith are we graffed in to chriſt the vyne. The ſecond: Thei muſt not be euery nor al maner of workes, but ſuch as god ordeyned of olde, that we ſhulde walke ther in. What the ſame be, he hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in his law, which is the wil of god. Herof is it, that the lorde in the goſpel, beyng deman<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And, yf thou wilt entre in to life, kepe the commaundmentes. The ten co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundmentes then are the moſt ſure and moſt perfecte fourme of good workes.
