            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE
TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> am in some sort oblig'd to declare, that no particular resentment of my own,
farther than the sense I had of the general vices of the times, and for the
Information of the publick, induced me to write this Satyr, or give it this Title;
but I confess I now do, and always did think it both my duty, and every ones else
that is Capacitated, to lash and expose Enormities of so damnable a quality as the
characters in the following Stanza's stand tainted with: And therefore if some
severe observers, that may perhaps in this Mirrour see the shadow of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate
Friend or Acquaintance, should think the Reflexions too gross, and open,
let such be pleas'd to consider on the subject matter, the substances, and horrid
Theme that inspires the satyrick Pen, and then doubtless (if they are not well-willers
to the Mathematicks themselves) they will generously allow, that Crimes
of this dreadfull Nature ought not to be Complemented, nor Guilded o'er with
Rhetorick in such a manner, as if the Authour rather design'd to shew the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of his own Poetry, than the vice he was writing on. 'Tis true there may be
offences which no Poet is so much a Cynick always to treat at this blunt Rate;
the surly Muse may be strok'd into good nature when the sin comes within the list
of Venial, as for example, Pride may be gloss'd over and call'd Presence of mind,
or Courtly breeding; Fornication may be poetically styl'd the Errour of Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
bloud, the Imperfection of irregular Youth, not guided by reason or reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Iudgment; The railing Whig, or what's worse, the <hi>Trimmer</hi> (provided
he speak no Treason) by the obliging Satyrist may be tenderly us'd, because he
has a way with him, and expresses nothing but according to his Conscience; The
sordid Miser may be rendred a wise and provident Person, nay, even the crying
sin Adultery, by the vernish and illustration of Poetry may be guilded o'er with
Moral justice, provided the Wife be Old and Bedrid, and the young Husband
wants an heir for his Estate: But <hi>Paricide,</hi> privy Conspiracy, Rebellion, Incest,
Murther, and such like, must never expect such favour; the Satyr there should
lash to the bloud, and make each stroke so terrible, and the shame so obvious,
that the weakest judgment may comprehend, and feel the meaning: Neither am
I of an opinion with them that affirm, that Satyr should tickle till it Smarts;
<pb facs="tcp:49200:5"/>
I rather, like a good Surgeon, would have it smart soundly at first, the wound
will tickle enough when it is healing: and I am very apt to believe the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted
<hi>Juvenal</hi> was in this mind, for I never read in any of his Satyrs, where
he was daubing any vice, with intent to lessen it, but, encouraged by his perfect
honesty, and man-like bravery of soul, always painted it in its natural Sables;
a Fool was by him drawn like a Fool, inspite of his guilt Coach, gaudy Trappings,
and numberless Acres of dirt, and a Traitour, like a Traitour, though his fortune made
him a Senatour; this I hold as a good example for every just Authour, and which I
am resolv'd to follow, let the Consequence happen as it pleases. Those that have not
read the first Part of this Poem, <hi>viz. (The Progress of honesty,</hi> written in the
beginning of <hi>Oates</hi>'s Plot) will be the less satisfied with these Sheets, not that
I doubt but the Reflexions will be easily understood, for I have always observ'd
that Rhubarb is more pleasing to our Nation than Honey, which, though I am
sorry to know, yet I cannot remedy; and, had I less Zeal for my Country, I should
be less diligent in exposing its faults; but, living under the Government of so
good and gracious a Sovereign, I should think my self unworthy of a smile from
him, or the least blessing of his Royal favour, if I should not, with my utmost
vigour and severest Genius, expose and render odious to futurity, the unnatural
<hi>Agents and Associatours in so horrible a Conspiracy.</hi>
