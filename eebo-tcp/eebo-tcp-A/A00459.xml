         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

profeſsion, we have all promiſed
to fight vnder Chriſts banner, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
all Antichriſtian power.
And namely, againſt the fleſh,
the world, and the Devill. To
make good this promiſe, I haue
ventured (being thereunto called) to fight a combate
with theſe adverſaries, in an eminent place, before
many and great ſpectators: Having ſo done, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
that I muſt finiſh my courſe, and keepe the
faith, or elſe I cannot ſay with the Apoſtle, that I
haue fought the good fight,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 4. 7. 8.</note> and ſo expect the crowne
of righteouſneſse. Therefore having begun <hi>conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere
verbis,</hi> to encounter with theſe adverſaries, by
way of preaching; I reſolved further <hi>pugnare ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu,</hi>
to ſet upon them, by way of writing. But here
peradventure you will ſay, <hi>Quorſum haec?</hi> to what
end is this writing! There are bookes written already
of all kind of arguments, and of this alſo. I grant,
there are ſo. But yet it doth not follow for all that,
that there ſhould be no more written, for as long as
the Devill and his Agents, doe dayly multiply their
temptations, and thereof ſet forth ſtill new impresſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and editions, able to ſeduce, if it were posſible,


<pb facs="tcp:15196:3"/>
the very elect; I ſee no reaſon, but that the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
and ſervants of Chriſt, ſhould be as forward to
multiply replies, and to ſet forth new anſweres to the
ſame. Sure I am, the Lords will and command is,
that we ſhould reſiſt the Divell;<note place="margin">Iam. 4. 7. Epheſ. 4. 27. c. 6. 13.</note> that we ſhould give
no place to his temptations; that we ſhould put on the
whole armour of God, that is, uſe all good meanes to
withſtand his wiles, and to repell his aſsaults. And
<hi>S. Auſtin</hi> doth instance in this meanes of writing,
ſaying, that in places infected with hereſie (or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
dangerous temptations) all men ſhould write,
that have any faculty therein, though it bee but the
ſame things in other words; that all ſorts of people,
among many bookes, might light upon ſome, and the
enemy in all places might have one, or other, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
him. And the ſame Author further ſaith, <hi>uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le
eſſe,</hi> that 'tis profitable,<note place="margin">Vtile eſt plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res à pluribus fieoi libros, diverſo stilo, ſed non di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſa fide.

of many perſons, made of like matters, in a diverſe

clearly appeare, to ſome in one manner, to ſome in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>Now that which <hi>S. Auſtin</hi> ſpeakes poſitively, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>utile eſſe,</hi> that it is profitable, that there be many
Bookes of many perſons, made of like matters, &amp;c. I
hope may be ſaid of mine. Certaine I am the matter is
profitable, and neceſsary for any mans study, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
to approve himſelfe a good ſouldiour of Ieſus
Chriſt. And for the manner alſo, though it be not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legant,
yet here is order, which is the maine thing
requiſite in abattell. And for matter and manner, it
hath gained the hearing of honourable, learned, and

            <p>And the occaſion this:<note place="margin">The occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note> The Apoſtle, having in
the former part of this Epiſtle, delivered many
holy, and heavenly exhortations, as that wee
ſhould walke worthy of the vocation wherewith
we are called, c. 4. 1. That we ſhould endeavour
to keepe the unity of the ſpirit in the bond of peace,
v. 2. That we ſhould put off the old man, even the
corruption of our nature, which is as old as man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind;
and to put on the new man, even Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,
with his merits, and manners, v. 22. 23. That
we ſhould have no fellowſhip with the unfruitfull
works of darkeneſſe, but rather reprove them, c. 5.
v. 11. That we ſhould traine up thoſe that belong
to our charge, in the inſtruction, and feare of the
Lord, c. 6. 4. In a word, that we ſhould all live in
obedience, performing our ſeverall duties, to
each other, c. 5. 21. c. 6. 1. having delivered
theſe, and many other pious exhortations:</p>
            <p>And withall, perceiving that no man can ſet
himſelfe to follow theſe precepts, and to doe theſe
duties, but that he ſhall find many diſcourageme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts,
many lets and hinderances, ſome from fleſh and
blood within, others from Sathan and the world
without. Yea, and ſuch diſcouragements, as that
man of himſelfe is not able to withſtand, &amp; to ſtand
perfect in all things. Perceiving this, the Apoſtle,
like a faithfull Miniſter, and a good Leader of the
Lord of hoſts, animates and incites his fellowes,
and followers to ſtand faſt in the faith,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 16. 13.</note> to quit

And this that they might the better doe, he tells
them how to ſtrengthen, and arme themſelues to

that the fleſh luſteth againſt the ſpirit, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 17. So
then, the fleſh, that is, our owne corrupt fleſh and

            <p>A good ſouldiour will rightly diſcerne betwixt

that if he put any to the hazard, hee will put thoſe
that are leſſe principall. But as for the head, which

the day. This corruption and depravedneſſe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,

            <p>A mans owne heart is as arch a traytor, as any he

becauſe he is not a forraine but an home-bred ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
fighting not as a tall ſouldiour, but as a crafty
traytor rebelling againſt the ſpirit; like <hi>Dalilah</hi> in

like the moth in the garment, it is bred in us, and
dayly cheriſhed by us, and yet frets and deſtroyes
us. The heart is deceitfull above all things, as the

Sathan himſelfe in ſome reſpect, for our owne

but our corrupt heart is as the mother conceiving,
and bringing forth ſinne. Sathan the father of ſin,
could doe nothing without this Mother. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
cannot prevaile againſt us but by the helpe of

Every man is tempted by his owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence

he can get no advantage over us.</p>
            <p>Behold then and conſider who is your enemy,
it is not ſo much a forrain, as a domeſtick foe, a

            <p>Secondly, hereby let us learne not to bee over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
in conſulting with fleſh and blood, when
any thing is to be done. Will a King counſell with
a traytor, whom he knowes to bee ſo? This were
to ruinate himſelfe, and his kingdome. Will any

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:15196:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
knowes to be meere deceit and conſenage? That
were to overthrow himſelfe and his cauſe. Now
the fleſh is a traytor, and ſeekes thy deſtruction. A
deceiver that gives ill counſell,<note place="margin">1 Kings 12. v. 10.</note> as the young men

follow the counſell of the fleſh. But as <hi>S. Paul</hi>
when hee was to goe to <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> to take upon
him the calling of an Apoſtle, did not conſult
with fleſh and blood, as himſelfe ſaith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 16.
So when any thing is to be done, be not over-for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to conſult with fleſh and blood, but with
Gods ſpirit, in Gods word, for the wiſdome of the
ſpirit is life and peace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 6.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> And ſo likewiſe, when any matter of faith and
religion is propoſed, and comes to be weighed and
embraced; Weigh it not in the ballance of humane

the word of God, leane not too much to your

matters. For what good judgement is to bee
expected of one that is an enemy to goodneſſe?
and ſuch is the carnall mind, an enemy, yea enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

ſpecially in matters of religion. Bee not wiſe in
your owne conceits, leaſt in ſeeking to bee wiſe, ye
become fooliſh, as the Gentiles, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 22.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, becauſe fleſh &amp; blood is an adverſary <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>

good nature. Is there any good in fighting againſt

wherwith ſhall wee be clothed? For in ſo doing, we
doe as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did with the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> even

pierce themſelves with many ſorrowes, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
ſaith, they fall into many temptations, and ſnares,
and into many fooliſh and hurtfull luſts, which
drowne them in perdition and deſtruction. That
which I ſaid before then, I ſay againe with the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,
love not the world, neither the things of this

earth,<note place="margin">Coloſ. 3. v. 2.</note> and ſet them on things above. Some will ſay

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> A fourth wile of Sathan is to plead that he hath
many, and great ones of his ſide, euen the greateſt in
the ſtate, and the chiefeſt in the country that be ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
adulterers, drunkards, oppeſſors, Papiſts, and the
like. Doe any of the Rulers beleeue in Chriſt, ſaith he
by his advocates, <hi>Ioh. 7. v.</hi> 48. This ſect is every
where ſpoken againſt,<note place="margin">Act. 28. v. 22.</note> is their plea in another place,
As if many did not run the broad way, as Chriſt ſaith,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 13. or that many and mighty were called, 1.
<hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 26. or if called were choſen, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. 16.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> A fift wile of Sathan is to obiect the miſeries, and
the reproches, and the many overthrowes that the
the ſervants of God ſuſtaine in the world, and the
proſperitie of the wicked on the other ſide. Thus he
doth <hi>Malac.</hi> 3. 14. 15. As if Chriſts kingdome were
of this world, <hi>Iohn</hi> 18. 36. or that being killed for
Chriſts ſake, they were not therein more then Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 37.</p>
            <p>A ſixt ſleight of Sathan is to ſet out foule ſinnes
and errors, with a faire face, colour and countenance,
even with the colour of grace and vertue, even as the
the crafty pyrate doth ſomtime hang out the ſame
colours that the honeſt Mariner doth, thereby to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trappe
him.<note place="margin">2. Cor. 11. 4.</note> So Sathan will ſometimes transforme
himſelfe into an Angel of light. As thus, he will ſet
out licentiouſneſſe under the name of libertie, drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe
under the colour of good fellowſhip, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe
under the name of good husbandry, fury
under the name of mettle, or manhood, whoredome
under the name of loving a miſtreſſe, Simony under
the name of gratuity, unlawfull ſports under the
name of honeſt mirth and recreation, Poperie under


<pb n="33" facs="tcp:15196:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the name of old Religion, or the Catholicke faith.
Depopulation, and encloſing of commons under the
name of uſing ones owne; or doing with ones owne
as he liſt &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thus he dies all his bad clothes in good colours,
guilds over his falſe coyne, ſugars over his temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and paints the foule faces of ſinne with the fine
colours of vertues and graces.</p>
            <p>Yea hee will not ſticke to adventure to deceive
<hi>Saul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Sam. 18. v. 14.</note> under <hi>Samuels</hi> mantle.<note place="margin">Prov. 8.</note> O then, what need have
we to flye to Ieſus Chriſt, who dwelleth with pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
What need have we not to be carried with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
thing that hath a ſhew of goodneſſe, or indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency.
But to bring theſe painted ſtrumpets of the
Devill, to the light, yea and to the heat of the word
of God. And then their painting ſhall melt away,
and we ſhall ſee their beauty came out of the Devills
boxe. Beloved, <hi>nimium ne crede colori,</hi> be not carried
away with colours, and ſhowes. The Devill hath a
faire colour for the fouleſt ſinne.</p>
            <p>A 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> trick of the Devill is to put a vizard of evill <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/>
upon that which is good. As to call the Catholicke
and Apoſtolicke doctrine of our Church <hi>hereſie,</hi>
and the Profeſſors thereof <hi>Hereticks,</hi> ſo the <hi>Papists:</hi>
to call the wholeſome diſcipline of our Church <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
ſuperſtition,</hi> ſo the <hi>Schiſmaticks.</hi> To call conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of ſinne, and a deſire in all things to live honeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
preciſe niceneſſe, ſo the carnall Goſpellers. Thus
by calling evill good, and good evill, hee would
bring it to paſſe that there ſhould be nothing but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
and ſo in the end nothing but woe? For woe
ſhall be to him that calls evill good, and good evill,
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 5. 20.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:15196:21"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> Another Stratageme of the Devill is to wound
us with our owne weapons, even with our very
graces; As thus, if he ſees ſome zealous, and fervent
in religion, ſo that he can in no wiſe quench this fire,
then he will throw his Gun-powder into it, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the colour of zeale, bring them to prepoſterous
indiſcretion, yea to a blind and bold madneſſe. As
to undertake, being private men, to reforme publick
abuſes, without the Magiſtrates authority, and to
make as great fire for the roſting of an <hi>egge,</hi> as for
the roſting of an <hi>Oxe;</hi> I meane to bee as zealous for
the ſmall, as for the weightier matters of the law,
for the ſwadling clothes, as for the body of religion,
for the circumſtance, as for the ſubſtance. A thing
very dangerous to the Church, as we may ſee in the
example of <hi>Auda Biſhop in Perſia,</hi> who in an exceſſe
of zeale throwing downe a Temple of the Pagans,
was the cauſe that the king thereby incenſed, threw
downe all temples of the Chriſtians, as <hi>Theodoret</hi>
writes, <hi>Lib.</hi> 5. Remember then to keep the meane ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Gods word, <hi>Iſa</hi> 30. 21. Be not righteous
overmuch, make not thy ſelfe over wiſe, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.
16. If ye cannot doe that good ye &amp; deſire, doe that ye
can, and ſo bee zealous according to knowledge,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 2. If with Paul ye cannot put downe <hi>Castor,</hi>
and <hi>Pollux,</hi> the badges of <hi>heatheniſme</hi> or <hi>Papiſme,</hi> yet
doe not run out of the ſhippe, S. Paul did not ſo, <hi>Act.</hi>
28. 11. or if ye dwell in <hi>Epheſus</hi> an idolatrous place
where the great Goddeſſe Diana is worſhiped, ſo
that with S. Paul ye canot hinder it, yet for all that,
doe not in an undiſcreet zeale leaue your Miniſter,
runne out of <hi>Epheſus, S. Paul</hi> did not ſo, <hi>Act.</hi> 19. 10.
I take it, that wiſdome is not from above, when men


<pb n="35" facs="tcp:15196:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
will doe nothing, unleſſe they may doe what they
will. Surely ſuch fiery zeale hath ſome of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills
powder in it.</p>
            <p>Another pollicy of Sathan to overthrow Gods <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/>
ſervants and ſouldiours, is to perſwade thoſe that bee
great wits, to prie into the counſells, and decrees
of their Generall Chriſt Ieſus, when they ſhould
follow him. And to meddle with his Myſteries,
when they ſhould meddle with their owne buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:
knowing that to be the way to bring them out
of favour, and to be rebuked with <hi>Peter,</hi> for curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
with <hi>Quid ad te?</hi> what is that to thee? follow thou
me, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 21. 21.</p>
            <p>Many other wiles, and Stratagems Sathan hath,
to enſnare, and entrap us; which I have now no time
to relate, theſe be they which be now moſt in uſe.
And by theſe you ſee what a dangerous enemy you
have.</p>
            <p>What remaineth then, but that we ſhake off all
ſecurity, and provide, and prepare to withſtand him?
What remaineth but that wee ſhould bee ſober and
watch, ſeeing our adverſary the Devill goeth about
and ſeeketh ſo many waies to devoure us? That is the
counſell of the Apoſtle in this caſe, let us follow it,

            <p>Specially let us be carefull that wee give him no

            <p>One is being too wordly minded, ſo much the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
text here doth teach us, for therefore the Devill is
called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a ruler of the world. <hi>Quia praeva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let

upon the place, that is, becauſe he prevailes much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
thoſe that are wordly minded. And this the
Apoſtle witneſſeth more plainely, in another place,
ſaying, that they which be rich fall into temptation,
and a ſnare of the Devill. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 9.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> A ſecond way, whereby we give advantage unto
Sathan againſt us, is by living in the darkneſſe of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance.
This we are taught alſo here in the text, in
that Sathan is here called <hi>Rector tenebrarum,</hi> (.i.) Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
of the darkneſſe of this world, for this is, becauſe
he rules, and domineires moſt over them that live in
darkneſſe, and blindneſſe of mind, in darke and blind
ignorance of the Scripture. And this our Saviour
ſpeakes in more plaine termes, ſaying, ye erre, not
knowing the Scriptures, <hi>Mark.</hi> 12. 24. ſo that if we
will not fall into errours and the ſnares of the Devill,
we muſt beware how we live in darke ignorance.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> A third way, whereby we give the Devill advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
over us, is by yeelding a little to his temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as to ſweare, lie, or ſteale a little, and the like.
For if he can get us to yeeld to his motions in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle;
he will quickly bring us to more. If this Serpent
can wind in his head, hee will quickly draw his
whole body after. <hi>Patente portâ impoſſibile eſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum
ulteriùs non procedere.</hi> Set open but one gate of
a beſieged city, and the enemies will come in as
certainly, as if all the walls were demoliſhed. Let
errour get but once into the belfrey, and it will never
leave till it be in the chancell, as learned <hi>Fulk</hi> hath
noted. Suffer it to be but in the porch, and it will not
be long, but you ſhall ſee it poſſeſſed of the Church
it ſelfe, yea and jetting in the pulpit alſo. As then


<pb n="37" facs="tcp:15196:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Moſes</hi> would not yeeld to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in a hoofe, <hi>Exod.</hi>
10. 20. or orthodoxall chriſtians to <hi>Arrius</hi> in a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

yeeld to any errour in life or doctrine, in profeſſion
or practiſe, ſpecially not to idolatry. No, not for all
the kingdomes in the world, and the glory thereof.
So would not Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 8, 9. no not for an

                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>hoſtis.</note> And the more we give place to him, the more
he encroaches. Therefore beware how you yeeld to
him in the leaſt motion, in an apple, as <hi>Eve,</hi> or in a
looke, as <hi>Lots</hi> wife. Give a hot horſe his head at
firſt, and he will ſurely runne away with you. And
ſo will this beaſt if we give him the bridle, if wee but
a little yeeld to him. Sathan can uſe ſmall finnes, as
the fiſher uſeth ſmall haires, to hold the fiſh as faſt,
or faſter then greater tackling, and ſecret ſinnes to
doe more harme in the ſoule then open.</p>
            <p>A 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> way, whereby wee give advantage to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
Devill againſt us, is by ruſhing into thoſe places or
companies, where Sathan hath power over our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of ſoules, in regard of the dangerous provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to ſinne they yeeld. As ſolitary and ſecret places;
places of idolatry, of whoredome, of exceſſive drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
gaming, ſwearing, &amp;c. the company of moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,
railers, diſſemblers, or any other wicked per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.
Theſe are the Devills factors, and their dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
his ſtaple, his ſchoole-houſe as <hi>S. Cyprian,</hi> his
throne as <hi>S. Iohn</hi> calls it, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. 13. Now can a man

of mind to believe, and confeſſe our peace
and reconciliation with God through Chriſt. And
to honour and obey him for it, theſe are the ſhooes
here commended unto us. With theſe king <hi>David</hi>

and firme reſolution of the heart, to believe and obey


<pb n="50" facs="tcp:15196:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Goſpell of peace, we ſhall never be able to hold

ſpeciall furniture, and that which we are to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove

the ſhield of faith. That we are to take above all, ſo
ſaith the Apoſtle, above all take the ſhield of faith,
v. 16. That is, after all your knowledge of the truth,
and your righteouſneſſe, according to the knowne
truth, and your reſolution, to walke in this knowne
true righteouſneſſe: Yet reſt not upon all this, but
when ye have done all, deny your ſelves, renounce
all truſt, and confidence in your owne righteouſneſſe,
and lay hold on the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, by the
hand of faith, on the mercy of God in Chriſt for
your ſalvation, according as it is offered in the word,
and preſented in the Sacraments. This righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
this mercy of God in Chriſt is that ſhield that
can quench all the fiery darts of the wicked. Indeed
faith is here called the ſhield, in the text, but that is
not becauſe it is ſo in it ſelfe, but becauſe it takes
hold of Chriſt, and his righteouſneſſe which is the
true ſhield indeed, and puts it on, and makes it ours.
So that,<note place="margin">Ioh. 25. 5.</note> though we can doe nothing of our ſelves, in

which are the objects of our faith, and the ground of

115. 2. Here againe, we are to remember to furniſh

This hope and patient expectation of the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance

a <hi>ſcriptum eſt,</hi> a place of ſcripture, and thereby cut
off their temptations, as with a ſword. The word of
God is mighty and powerfull to that purpoſe, being
rightly applyed, as we may ſee by the example of
Chriſt in the fourth of Mat. yea ſharper then any
two edged ſword, as <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſaith <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 12. Take it
then, put it on, farre be it from us, to diſarme you of

as the ſame teachers deale with their people, no,

the ſpirit which is the word of God, and to put it on,
not by ſpells, and charmes, as ignorant people uſe to
doe, but by reading, hearing, meditating and hiding
it in your hearts, and applying it as occaſion is offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
to anſwere, and to put off any evill temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.

            <p>Theſe be the ſeverall pieces of the armour of God,
with theſe we muſt arme our ſelues, &amp; fight, if ever we
will prevaile, in this ſpirituall warfare. It is not here,
as in the bodily warfare, <hi>illic enim humanis viribus
reſiſtitur gladius opponitur gladio, homo cum homine
confligit, vis vim, ars artem excipit.</hi> In the bodily
warfare men doe commonly reſiſt their adverſaries,
with ſuch weapons as their enemies doe impugne
them withall, but here <hi>alia eſt ratio,</hi> 'tis otherwiſe, as
<hi>Calvin</hi> notes upon the place.</p>
            <p>In the ſpirituall warfare, if we fight againſt Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,
and his complices, with ſuch weapons as they
uſe in fighting againſt us, then we are gone. That is
if we render evill for evill, and rebuke for rebuke,
and give as good as they bring, as the ſaying is, then
we are foyled by Sathan and his power. For, <hi>Quid
interest inter provocantem &amp; provocatum?</hi> Saith <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian,</hi>
that is, what difference is there betweene him
that doth provoke to evill, and him that is provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
to evill, by ill words or deeds? <hi>Niſi quod ille prior
in maleficio deprehenditur, &amp; ille poſterior.</hi> But that
one ſinnes firſt, and the other next. And ſo both are


<pb n="55" facs="tcp:15196:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>
foyled by Sathan, cauſing them both to ſinne.</p>
            <p>We muſt not then fight with Sathan, and his
complices, with ſuch weapons as they bring, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
evill for evill, or rebuke for rebuke. But if we
will fight to overcome, we muſt not be overcome of
evill, but overcome evill with good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 21. That
is, if our enemies curſe, as they doe ſometimes with
bell, booke, and candle, we muſt not curſe againe, but
bleſſe. If they perſecute, we muſt not perſecute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
but pray for them, and doe good to them, that
hurt us, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 44. Againſt ſpirituall harmes, we
muſt uſe ſpirituall armes. Againſt the works of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
we muſt put on the armor of light, that is, vertues
againſt vices. As <hi>David</hi> being to fight with <hi>Goliah,</hi>
did caſt from him the armour of <hi>Saul,</hi> and tooke to
him weapons farre unlike thoſe that <hi>Goliah</hi> brought
againſt him: So muſt we, when we goe out, in the
name of God, againſt that uncircumciſed <hi>Philiſtine,</hi>
we muſt caſt from us carnall weapons, and put on the
armour of God, even the grace of God, his manifold
graces, as a compleate armour. And namely, and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
theſe graces here mentioned, as the grace
of truth and ſyncerity of religion, the grace of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe
and upright converſation, the grace of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
and purpoſe of heart to profeſſe and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
according to the Goſpell of peace, the grace
of faith in the promiſes of God in Chriſt, the grace
of hope and expectation of the promiſes beleeved,
the word of grace, the grace of prayer and ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
to God, both publike, and private.</p>
            <p>Theſe graces are the armour of God, and they
are ſo called by way of compariſon with corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
armour, as that, becauſe they are given us of


<pb n="56" facs="tcp:15196:32"/>
God,<note place="margin">Why the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God are called ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.</note> for our defence againſt our ſpirituall enemies,

            <p>But herein, as there is a paritie, or likneſſe; ſo there
is a great diſparity, or unlikeneſſe, betwixt theſe, and

ſufficient, and therefore broken in pieces, but this is
alwayes ſufficient, ſo ſaith the Lord to this Apoſtle in

            <p>Take then unto your ſelves this whole and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
armour of God, theſe ſpeciall graces, here
mentioned.</p>
            <p>But here it may be enquired,<note place="margin">Q:</note> may not we alſo take
the armour of men, Corporall armour, as well
as ſpirituall?</p>
            <p>I anſwere,<note place="margin">R:</note> we may: it is lawfull for Chriſtian men,
at the commandement of the Magiſtrate, to weare

               <hi>Art.</hi> 37. and alſo according to

to beare the ſword in vaine, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 4. that he
that hath none ſhould buy a ſword. <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 36.
That many good men did weare, and uſe humane

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:15196:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>
kingdomes <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 33. and <hi>Cornelius</hi> the <hi>Centurion
Act.</hi> 10. All theſe did arme the body, and uſe corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
weapons, and ſo may wee.</p>
            <p>But here I ſay againe, that the body is not the
firſt part that we muſt arme, nor humane weapons
the firſt weapons that we muſt take to our ſelves.
The firſt part that we muſt arme, is the inner man, the
ſoule, which is the life of the body. And the firſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
that we muſt arme it withall, is the armour, or
grace of God, which is the life of the ſoule. Thus
ſaith the Apoſtle, in the former chapter, at the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
verſe &amp;c. I bow my knees unto the father of our
Lord Ieſus Chriſt, of whom all the family of heaven
and earth is named, that he would grant you, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the riches of his glory, to bee ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened
with might by his ſpirit, in the <hi>inner
man.</hi> And thus <hi>S. Peter,</hi> your adorning, let it
not bee outward adorning,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 3. 3. 4.</note> but let it bee the hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
man of the heart, in that which is not corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible,
even the ornament of a meeke, and quiet ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
the ornament of faith, and a good conſcience,
here called the breſt-plate of righteouſneſſe. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
this, and the reſt of the ornaments, and muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
here mentioned, even the ſtrongeſt, and beſt
armed man, will prove a coward, and flye when
none purſueth, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith <hi>Prov.</hi> 28. 1. And as
the <hi>Syrians</hi> did, 2. <hi>Kings</hi> 7. 7.</p>
            <p>I ſay then unto you (Brethren) arme your ſelves
as well as you can, both for the inner, and outward
man, both with the corporall and ſpirituall armor: but
firſt of all, &amp; above all, arme the inner man, with the
armour of God. Take unto your ſelves the armour of
God, his grace which is ſufficient for you; 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 9.</p>
            <p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Take it to your ſelves, and not only that, but put it

be taken, and hung up at home or ſometime to bee
ſhewed abroad, to be ſeene of men: but to bee uſed
and imployed daily, in the Lords ſervice, which is
meant by putting on. God gives us his gifts and
graces, to the end that we ſhould uſe &amp; employ them.
And therefore he ſaith in another place, ſtirre up the

            <p>Put on the whole armour of God. Not only the
girdle of truth, and the breſt-plate of righteouſneſſe,
but all the whole armour, head and foote, for if you
ſhould arme the head only, the Devill happily would
ſtrike at the foot. If the foot only, then he might hurt
the head. If both, and leaue our breſt unarmed, hee
might wound us at the heart. Therefore to make ſure
worke, put on the whole armour, that yee may repel

Therefore it is good for us, to have ſpeciall

in ſetting forth his ſervice in others, in maintaining
his ſervice and ſervants, in building, repairing, and
beutifying the place of his ſervice. And here you

wherein Sathan goeth about like a roaring Lion, and

ſometimes like an Angel of light, ſeeking whom he

and this not for a day only,<note place="margin">We are to put on Gods ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly.</note> but every day, as long as

never leave tempting them as long as they live in

of them, for a ſeaſon, as he left tempting of Chriſt,
but he will come againe, with a freſh aſſault upon
them. He is called Beèlzebub, the maſter fly; and flyes
though they be never ſo much beaten away, yet they
will come againe and againe to the ſame place, and
ſo will Sathan being repelled, renue his temptations.
This uncleane ſpirit, when he is caſt out, will ſeeke

His going away, is but to renue his aſſaults, his

The true and faithfull ſervants of God have beene,

by the materiall ſword, ſo Chriſt hath fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told,

ſaying, they ſhall kill you <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16. 2. And <hi>Revel.</hi>
11. at the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe, it is ſaid of the two witneſſes,
that is, of the faithfull preachers and profeſſors of the
truth, that when they have finiſhed their teſtimony,
the beaſt that commeth out of the bottomleſſe pit,
that is, <hi>Antichriſt</hi> with his adherents, ſhall make
warre againſt them, and kill them, that is, with the
materiall ſword: But not with the ſpirituall. With
that they overcome him, even with the breath that
commeth out of their mouthes, ſo it is ſaid there, at
the fift verſe, if any will hurt them, fire proceedeth
out of their mouthes, and devoureth their enemies,
even the fiery, and powerfull word of God, which is
able, and ſhall conſume the adverſary, 2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 8.
ſo that there is a victory on both ſides. The enemy
many times kills, and overcomes the faithfull wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
and true ſervants of God, with the materiall
ſword. And they overcome the enemy with the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
ſword, ſlaying them in their ſoules, though
not in their bodies, for the word is the ſavour of
death unto death, in them that periſh, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 16.</p>
            <p>Againe, the ſervants and ſouldiors of Chriſt, even

               <hi>victoria eſt obtinere pro quo certas,</hi>
ſaith <hi>Tertullian,</hi> victory is to obtaine that which we
ſtrive for. And now, what is the ſtrife, betweene the
Chriſtian and the tormentor, but this? the tormentor
ſeekes to drive the Chriſtian to deny Chriſt, and
his Goſpell, the Chriſtian for all his torments con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth
him the more, the tormentor fumes, and
chafes, and ſighes that he hath not his will, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is overcome. The Chriſtian rejoyceth that he

is counted worthy to ſuffer for Chriſt,<note place="margin">Act. 5. 41. &amp; cap. 16.</note> and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant,
and therefore goes away with the victory.

writes in the fift booke, and firſt Chapter of
his Eccleſiaſticall hiſtory. And Chriſtians in their
torments, have gloried of their Conqueſt, over
their torments, and tormentors. Thus the Apoſtle
<hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 35. 37.</note> who ſhall ſeparte us, from the love of Chriſt?
ſhall tribulation, or diſtreſſe, or perſecution, or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
or nakedneſſe, or peril, or ſword? Nay, in all
theſe things we are more then Conquerors, through
him that loved us. Of this Conqueſt likewiſe of
Chriſtians, in their afflictions and perſecutions, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
others have given notable proofe, yea, and
thoſe of our owne Nation, as <hi>Glover, Farrar,
Hawkes.</hi> This laſt, was deſired by ſome godly
friends, for their confirmation, to give ſome token,
when he was in the flames, whether the paine were
tollerable, or noe: (A ſtrange time, one would thinke,
to attend upon ſignes, or friends) but ſo he did, after
his eyes were ſtarted out of his head, his fingers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
with fire, and when ever one thought him
dead, and did expect the fall of his body. Loe ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly
hee lifts up his ſtumps, and thrice (as famous
Conquerour) he clapps them over his head,<note place="margin">Fox. Acts and Mon. p. 1447.</note> in token
of victory and triumph. Thus the faithfull famouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conquer, when they ſeeme to bee conquered by
their enemies. Though they be caſt downe one way,
either in body, goods, or good name; yet they ſtand
another way, the beſt way; they ſtand in the faith,
they ſtand in the grace, and favour of God. They


<pb n="69" facs="tcp:15196:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſtand in their ſoules, before the Son of God, though
they fall in their bodies, before the Sonnes of men.
They ſtand in great boldneſſe, before the face of ſuch

12. 11. 'tis not here, as in the temporall warre, there,
