            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THOV maist justly expect from me some account of my publishing these <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks</hi> of <hi>S. E.</hi> and of my <hi>Answers</hi> thereto, which I will give, as clearly and briefly as I may. The <hi>Remarks</hi> seem writ by one, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly very serious, but highly confident in his way, and as Magisterial as if he were no vulgar In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter of Prophecies of Scripture, nor ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Remarker upon the Interpretations of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but some infallible Iudge or decisive Oracle in the case. And therefore that which is so highly prized of himself, it seemed hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full that it was of such a nature, if rightly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, that it might give some diversion at least, if not satisfaction to others. Who the <hi>Remarker</hi> is, I cannot satisfie thy curiosity to tell thee. But I have adventured to call him <hi>Mennonite</hi> for that odd wild conceit of his,
<pb facs="tcp:48067:3"/>
that all <hi>Magistracy</hi> and <hi>Monarchy</hi> conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentially, will go down in the <hi>Millennial Reign</hi> of Christ. Which is the opinion of <hi>Daniel Brenius</hi> a <hi>Mennonite,</hi> but otherwise not an unlearned Person, and the point is disputed betwixt him and his Master <hi>Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copius.</hi> What <hi>Dutch</hi> or <hi>German,</hi> or other foreign Name those Initial letters <hi>S. E.</hi> will answer to, I cannot easily conjecture. But if it were left to me fit a name to them, from what language I please, I would doe it from the Greek, and it should be <hi>Streblosinous Ereunetes,</hi> those two words comprizing both the good and bad of his <hi>Genius</hi> and <hi>Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance,</hi> viz. his pains in enquiring into the sense of the Scripture-Prophecies, which is a laudable enterprize, and his studied perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and distortion of the sense of them to make them comply with the unaccountable dreams, as I deem it, of his own fancyfull Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, which is a thing no-wise approva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. However, he seeming to me one more than ordinary addicted to, and exercised in this study of interpreting Prophecies, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly those of <hi>Daniel</hi> and the <hi>Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lypse,</hi> I thought it not amiss to publish all his <hi>Remarks</hi> upon Dr. <hi>H. More</hi> his Expositions
<pb facs="tcp:48067:3"/>
of them, together with my <hi>Answers</hi> thereto, for these Reasons following.</p>
            <p>First, For that the <hi>Remarker</hi> having used all the diligence he could, and as I perceive, being eagerly set to find flaws in the <hi>Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi>'s Interpretations of the Visions of those two Prophets, and attempting to substitute others in their room; I have plainly discovered, that in effect he has found none, nor could substi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute any thing that would so properly agree with the Text as that which the <hi>Expositor</hi> has made choice of before. Which therefore is a demonstration of the <hi>firmness</hi> and <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty</hi> of Intelligibleness in the <hi>Divine Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> and that they are in no-wise compliable with every fancy of either a rash or designing Interpreter, nor may be made a nose of wax, as some fondly imagine.</p>
            <p>Secondly, In answering these <hi>Remarks,</hi> there are so many occasions of taking notice of the true and genuine Rules of interpreting Prophecies, the Visions especially of <hi>Daniel</hi> and the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> and of the <hi>Remarker</hi>'s transgression of them, that the reading of these <hi>Remarks,</hi> with the <hi>Answers</hi> thereto, cannot but add to the skill and judgment of any one that has a Genius this way.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:48067:4"/>Thirdly, In the Answers to these <hi>Remarks,</hi> there is not onely a farther illustration and confirmation of the <hi>Expositor</hi>'s interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of these Prophecies, but light also given to several other Prophecies or passages of them. Vpon which account they must needs seem considerable to such as have a mind to these kind of studies, than which there are none more noble or more becoming either a Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher or a Christian, provided they pursue them out of their love to God and humble a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration of his Providence over the Sons of men, and out of no sinister design of serving a Party.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, I thought it very requisite to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish these <hi>Remarks,</hi> together with my <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers,</hi> because I could not be assured but that sometime or other they might come out without any <hi>Answer</hi> to them, which might be a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to the Truth. For they seeming to be written with great confidence, and pretending much to Scripture-Autority, and being var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished over with Scripture-phrases, and no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy by to shew their errours and defects, they may strike great reverence into the heedless Populacy, and make the <hi>Remarker</hi> go for some notable <hi>Hypopheta</hi> or Interpreter of
<pb facs="tcp:48067:4"/>
the Prophets (whenas there is not one true stroke in all his pretended Interpretations that clash with the <hi>Expositor</hi>'s; though it is not so much to be imputed to want of diligence and ability in the <hi>Remarker</hi> as to the invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibleness of Truth) and so the ordinary peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple would be drawn into wretched mistakes; And the profane Wits not thinking it worth the while to give themselves the trouble of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering the errours of this new Interpreter, would be the more strongly confirmed in their own, and have new cause to insult over all pretences of understanding Prophecies.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, And I thought it the more requisite to publish these <hi>Remarks,</hi> and to answer them, because some extravagant Notions are applied to the Prophetical Visions by the <hi>Remarker</hi> (whether they be to be deemed <hi>Romanisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> or <hi>Anabaptistical,</hi> I know not, but) such as I thought did not so well comport with ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Christian spirit or the peace of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and therefore I thought it my bounden duty to beat them out of this harbour, and not to suffer these holy Oracles that were communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to the Church for her more safe and peacefull Guidance to be made Instruments of her Disquiet and Confusion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:48067:5"/>And lastly, I had a more special eye to those two great and usefull Truths exhibited to us in the Visions of the <hi>Apocalypse.</hi> The first, That the late <hi>Reformation</hi> begun by <hi>Luther,</hi> and propagated and perfected in other King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and Countries, and more especially here in <hi>England</hi> was the <hi>Rising of the Witnesses.</hi> The Second, That the <hi>Primitive</hi> Times till a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout four hundred years after Christ were <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metral.</hi> The evidence of which two Truths, the <hi>Remarker</hi> endeavours tooth and nail to smother and suppress by most wretchedly distor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and slubbering over the sense of the tenth Chapter of the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> and of the two suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Synchronal Visions, the one comprized in the eleventh Chapter, the other in the twelfth, thirteenth and fourteenth; and also by peremptorily denying but groundlesly, That the <hi>Vision</hi> of the <hi>seven Churches</hi> reaches any farther than to the beginning of the <hi>Millen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium.</hi> All which is done in favour of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved <hi>Mennonism,</hi> that Christ may not be held to begin his reign where there is any vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible <hi>Monarch</hi> or <hi>Civil Magistrate</hi> that rules. Which opinion, though it may seem the more tolerable and harmless, by how much the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance is the greater from the present Age to
<pb facs="tcp:48067:5"/>
the <hi>Millennium,</hi> yet it being apt to beget a prejudice against <hi>Monarchy</hi> and <hi>civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracy,</hi> and to impress a false Idea of the reign of Christ in the minds of the Vulgar, as if his reign was inconsistent with <hi>Monarchy</hi> and <hi>ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Magistracy;</hi> And for as much as it is joined with the denying, That the late <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi> is the <hi>Rising</hi> of the <hi>Witnesses</hi> (which truth utterly routs that fond opinion against civil Magistracy) and also with a belief that their <hi>1260</hi> days prophesying in sackcloth is but about expiring, or but just expired, upon which the Witnesses are to lye three days and an half slain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which naturally tends to the impregnating mens minds with a fond ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of a sudden completion of the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of their Rising (which yet God be thanked is accomplished already) and so to cause endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of Innovations and Tumults of Seditions and Rebellions (as amongst the <hi>Jews</hi> by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of <hi>false Christs</hi> after the <hi>true</hi> one was come so) amongst <hi>Christians</hi> upon a <hi>false</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of the sudden Rising of the Witnesses, when <hi>in truth</hi> they are <hi>risen already:</hi> These things are of so great import, as also the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of the <hi>Symmetricalness</hi> of the Primitive Ages, for the present peace of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb facs="tcp:48067:6"/>
Churches, and the reconciling the Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to the publick worship, that I thought them alone a sufficient Motive to publish these Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks and Answers for the stearing men off from such wild and disorderly conceits which so easily find harbour in Melancholick and Enthusiastick spirits, and which other crafty and disaffected Politicians are over prone, cunningly and design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly to serve their turns of. See the <hi>Expositor</hi>'s Pref. to his <hi>Apocalypsis Apocalypseos, § 12.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This usefulness made me with great alacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty publish these <hi>Remarks,</hi> they giving me so fit an occasion to instruct, and I hope to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince men of the errour of this false spirit that has gone out into the World, and has, I fear, deluded too many. And therefore the <hi>Remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,</hi> whether he has writhen and forced his Wit and Invention to personate an eager Impugner of the <hi>Expositor</hi>'s Interpretations of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies of <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi> or has indeed se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously attacked them, he has however done good service to the Church of God by drawing out Answers more fully to explain and confirm those important Truths so certainly exhibited in the Prophecies. And if the <hi>Answerer</hi> seem at any time to be something quick and smart upon the <hi>Remarker,</hi> or rather upon that <hi>Spirit</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:48067:6"/>
he is actuated withall (for he has no enmity against any man's person whatsoever) I hope it will not seem more to an indifferent judge than the perversness of the matter or manner of uttering it by the <hi>Remarker</hi> naturally called for. And not to shew a man's dislike of such things with some commotion of mind would but feed the humour of a conceited <hi>Enthusiast,</hi> and make him fansie he has got the <hi>Ascendent</hi> of his <hi>tame</hi> Adversary, and not impute his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gently handled to <hi>his</hi> Christian meekness and kindness of temper but to the power and dominion of <hi>his own</hi> tumid and delusive spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that commissions him to ride triumphantly over the necks of all such as are not ready to submit to the mistaken Dictates of his false light.</p>
            <p>And if this quickness and freeness of the <hi>Answerer</hi> should draw from the <hi>Remarker</hi> a bitter reviling Reply, which is neither a desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable nor probable Event if the <hi>Remarker</hi> have that ingenuity as to rejoice and acquiesce in the Truth with whomsoever it is found, yet it will not want its proper use. For then it will be still more manifest, that whereas the <hi>Remarker</hi> (though not taken up into an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding high Mountain, as Christ was by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and shewn all the Kingdoms of this World
<pb facs="tcp:48067:7"/>
and glory of them yet) fansying himself high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly caught up in the Spirit has uttered such sublime matter in this exaltation touching the glorious State and Oeconomy of the new <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi> and things in tendency thereto as tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend the conceit and allowance of any sober and considerate man; it will be hence I say still more manifest, that it is not from the height of any Divine Rapture that he has discovered such marvellous Mysteries, but that all this elevation of Spirit is nothing but the heaving of the <hi>Hypochondria,</hi> and the vain delusion of the touring fumes of an over-heated Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy; And that the sound understanding of <hi>Daniel</hi> and the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> does not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to <hi>Fanatical Enthusiasts,</hi> but to men of a more <hi>rational</hi> Genius, <hi>serene</hi> mind and <hi>so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> judgment.</p>
            <p>Thus, Reader, thou hast as full an account as I can give of the publishing these <hi>Remarks</hi> and <hi>Answers,</hi> together with the manner there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. How sufficient it is, thou wilt best perceive upon the perusal of them. Which thou wilt doe, I hope, with no small satisfaction, if or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, as they are placed, Chapter and Verse, thou readest the places in the <hi>Expositor</hi>'s Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions of <hi>Daniel</hi> and the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

thou readest the <hi>Remark</hi> and <hi>Answer.</hi> And if thou hast not those <hi>Expositions</hi> by thee, provided thou reade but the Verse in the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble which the <hi>Remark</hi> and <hi>Answer</hi> relate to, thou wilt seldom be at a loss for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding either of them. But as for the <hi>Remarks</hi> upon the <hi>Apology,</hi> if thou beest at a loss, thou must have recourse to the Pages thereof, which are constantly set down at the beginning of the <hi>Remark.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for those two little additional Pieces, <hi>Arithmetica Apocalyptica,</hi> and <hi>Appendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cula Apocalyptica,</hi> I need say little of them. The occasion of writing them is set down in each, and the scope and end of them is much what the same, with that of my <hi>Answer</hi> to the <hi>Remarks,</hi> viz. to undeceive the World and free men from such false Notions of some pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages in the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> as tend to unquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of mind, and unsetling the Church and State. For my <hi>Answer</hi> to the <hi>Remarks</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Apology</hi> (which I would have the Reader thoroughly to consider) so plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrating that the partial fall of <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>Rising</hi> of the <hi>Witnesses</hi> is the Issue of the <hi>42</hi> months war of the Beast with the Saints (<hi>Apoc. 13. v. 5, 7.</hi>) and with the
<pb facs="tcp:48067:8"/>
Witnesses <hi>(chap. 11. v. 7, 11.)</hi> which Issue is coincident with the close of the sixth Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, <hi>chap. 11. v. 14.</hi> And that all the Vials follow the sixth Trumpet, and the three Dox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ologies or Triumphs, And that the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the fulfilling of this partial fall of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi> and <hi>Rising</hi> of the <hi>Witnesses;</hi> the Issue, I say, of the <hi>42</hi> months war being thus accomplished, it naturally follows that the compute of the <hi>42</hi> months, (whatever that Number signifies) expires therewith, or is no farther to be reckoned upon. For the Time of a Vision can reach no farther than the Vision it self. But because he that gave me the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of writing <hi>Arithmetica Apocalyptica,</hi> seems not aware of this Reason, but doth not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding his acknowledgment of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation</hi> being the <hi>Rising</hi> of the <hi>Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> produce the Time of their Witnessing in Sackcloth beyond the abovesaid Issue of the <hi>42</hi> months war, more than an hundred years, in which expiration of the <hi>42</hi> months or <hi>1260</hi> days prophetical he surmises that Antichristia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity will be utterly rooted out of the Church, as if that would be the full completion of the <hi>Rising</hi> of the <hi>Witnesses;</hi> this gave me occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion in the above-mentioned <hi>Arithmetica A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocalyptica,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:48067:8"/>
to shew that <hi>Daniel</hi>'s seven Semi-Times not the <hi>1260</hi> days nor <hi>42</hi> months is the true Authentick <hi>eventual</hi> measure to compute the fulfilling of the <hi>Medial-Visions</hi> by.</p>
            <p>And I may here add, that if the fulfilling of the Vision of the <hi>Rising</hi> of the <hi>Witnesses</hi> and the fall of <hi>Babylon</hi> be enlarged to an utter ruine of the Antichristian Kingdom, and advancing the Reformation throughout Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom, and to the extending the last blast of the second Wo-Trumpet or sixth Trumpet, or the beginning of the seventh, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the three Triumphant expressions of Ioy till then, (for they must be contracted or enlarged together) I having proved so plainly that <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Vials,</hi> which are so many plagues upon Antichrist follow the sixth Trumpet, and those Triumphs or Doxologies, <hi>chap. 11. v. 15, 16, 17. chap. 14. v. 8.</hi> and <hi>chap. 15. v. 3.</hi> there will be no time for the pouring out these <hi>Vials</hi> till Antichrist be gone, upon whom they are to be poured. Which shews plainly that the success of the <hi>42</hi> months war with the <hi>Saints</hi> or <hi>Witnesses</hi> is not to be, as it were, continued from the <hi>Reformation</hi> till an <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal</hi> Rising of the Witnesses or full and <hi>final</hi> Ruine of <hi>Babylon</hi> at the expiration of the
<pb facs="tcp:48067:9"/>
               <hi>42</hi> Prophetical months, or <hi>1260</hi> years, but that the Reformation <hi>past</hi> is the <hi>adequate</hi> success of that <hi>42</hi> months War or <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Time, and Times, and half a Time, which is equivalent thereto, and the onely <hi>Authentick</hi> measure of the <hi>truth</hi> of the events of the <hi>Medial-Visions.</hi> And forasmuch as many Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick copies, <hi>(Apoc. 13.15.)</hi> instead of [to continue] have [to make war] <hi>forty two months,</hi> and that <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, if you leave out <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, signifies here to act at pleasure, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperously, freely and unmasterly, or untrolla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly as judicious Interpreters have noted; and since however the Beast cannot make war be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he continue, and that therefore his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance at least commences as high as his making war, and both are said to be <hi>42</hi> months; it is plain hence, that the Beast's continuance and his war do perfectly synchronize, and as one ends, so must the other, at the same time. But the Rising of the Witnesses is the issue and end of the <hi>42</hi> months war, therefore the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of that state of the Beast who is said to continue <hi>42</hi> months ends at the Rising of the Witnesses or fall of the tenth part of the City. Which is a plain intimation that those Interpreters are in the right that interpret

               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               </gap> be left out) to act at pleasure with uncontrollableness and success. Which state of the Beast ceased at the Rising of the Witnesses and fall of the tenth part of the City. For then was he over-mastered in a large part of his Dominions, and he could not <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, act so freely and domineeringly as he did before. So that all the pretence of prolonging the <hi>42</hi> months continuance of the Beast, <hi>Apoc. 13.5.</hi> beyond the time of the issue of the <hi>42</hi> months war, <hi>v. 7.</hi> and then at the <hi>42</hi> months end precisely taken, of quite extinguishing his power, plainly vanishes; the <hi>42</hi> months onely pointing at the <hi>entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of his reigning before he came into that <hi>broken</hi> condition, and not at the time of his reign <hi>at large.</hi> Of so <hi>great</hi> use is that little Piece for the preventing mistakes touching this matter.</p>
            <p>And for <hi>Appendicula Apocalyptica,</hi> by maintaining Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s Interpretation of the <hi>Seals</hi> against Mr. <hi>Durham</hi>'s, as also his <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metral</hi> Times of the Church antecedent to the <hi>Asymmetral,</hi> it does plainly strengthen the Right of <hi>Monarchy</hi> and <hi>Episcopacy</hi> from the Holy Writ against such as are otherwise affected.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:48067:10"/>And this is all that I have to say by way of <hi>Preface</hi> touching the <hi>whole</hi> Book, nor shall add any thing more to detain thee from the perusal thereof, but my prayers, that thou maist reade to thy own edification, and that what thou readest may either beget or encrease in thee a sober mind, and sensible of thy duty to God and to thy Prince, and to all that are in Autority under him, whether in Church or State.

                     <p>BOTH here and <hi>vers.</hi> 11. the direction to the seven Churches is rendred, [To the Catholick Church distinguished into se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Successions,] and so no literal sense, but onely a prophetical sense regarded in the Epistles.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> It was no part of the Expositor's scope to meddle with the literal sense, but to give a continued, coherent, prophetical sense onely, of this whole book of Prophecies, the <hi>Apocalypse.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ver.</hi> 6. Kings and Priests are doubtlesly to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken here, as in ch. 5. v. 10. <hi>And hast made us to our God Kings and Priests, and we shall reign on the Earth.</hi> So that the sense here given is a straining of the Text from a proper literal, to a forced metaphorical sense.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> The sense is very easie, unforced and exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing usefull, and a fit caution against such hot and heady Saints, who would be presently up, and reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Earth before they have attained to the Kingdom of Heaven within them, and have become Masters of their own Earthly minds. Reigning
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48067:13"/>
upon Earth seems here in the Text, on purpose omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, to give way to such an usefull and edifying In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation as is here given by the Expositor.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ver.</hi> 13. Our Saviour's being cloathed with a garment down to his foot, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle, seems to respect not onely his Priestly, but also his Kingly Office, the garment sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying the first, and the girdle that righteousness which was the girdle of his loins, and that faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness which was the girdle of his reins, <hi>Esa.</hi> ch. 11. v. 5. where he is described as a glorious, spiritual Prince. And as in the Epistle to the <hi>Philadelphian</hi> Church, his calling himself <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>true,</hi> respects both his Offices of <hi>Priest</hi> and <hi>King</hi>; so his garment seems to refer to the one, and his girdle to the Truth where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he was girded, whereby he is our Prince.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> That his Priestly office is here aimed at, is without question, and the Expositor is for such Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions as are most unquestionable. If what is added had been as certain, he would have taken it in. But it seems not onely uncertain, but unlikely. For Kings wear not their girdles about their <hi>paps,</hi> but about their <hi>loins</hi>; but the Priests did. And <hi>Aaron</hi>'s girdle was interwoven with gold. See <hi>Cornelius à lapide</hi> on the place. And lastly, as for [Holy and True] <hi>Truth</hi> as well as <hi>Holiness,</hi> respects his Priestly office according as the Seventy render <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Ver.</hi> 15. To say that the voice of Christ being as the sound of many waters does plainly discover, that Christ is here represented as in Union with his Church, is scarce sense. For the Union of him with his Church being spiritual, can badly be represented by the sound of a voice. Nor does what is said here of his voice,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48067:13"/>
signifie more than what is described, <hi>Psal.</hi> 29. viz. That the voice of the Lord is upon many waters, and is powerfull and full of Majesty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And though waters in the Prophetick style are used to signifie a multitude, yet it follows not that they must always do so, but may also be used in a Literal sense, as they are, <hi>ch.</hi> 20. <hi>v.</hi> 13. <hi>The Sea gave up the dead,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> Whenas it is said expresly, that his voice is as the sound of many waters, and waters in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick style signifie multitudes of people; what can be more easie and obvious than to interpret it, that his voice was as the voice of a multitude; and how fitly does that then signifie, that Christ is here represented in union with his Church, through whose mouths, by the breathing of his Holy Spirit in them, he speaks to the world, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And it is not the Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's conceit alone. St. <hi>Gregory, Tychonius, Haymo, Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phimus</hi> and <hi>Peresius</hi> interpret it of the sound of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, which was preached by zealously inspired Emissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and the truth thereof testified by innumerable witnesses in union with Christ by his Spirit. And indeed what can better signifie the spiritual union of the Church of Christ with his living members, than that all their voices should be, as it were, one voice, breathed out from the mouth of the Son of God? For that shews that they also have one heart, and one spirit, which is the Spirit of the Son of God, with which they are all united.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ver.</hi> 17. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s falling at the feet of Christ as dead, proceeded not from his fear, that the Vision might portend great evil to the People of God, but from such an astonishment as made <hi>Daniel,</hi> chap. 10. on the like Vision of Christ, there fall on his face in a dead sleep, having no strength remaining in him,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48067:14"/>
and his comeliness turn into corruption, and made a great quaking fall upon them that were with him, though they saw not the Vision. And as also made <hi>Ioshua</hi> fall on his face on his appearance to him, as a Captain of the Host of the Lord.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> That it was not onely from the glory, but the terrour of the Vision, his legs standing in fire, and a sword coming out of his mouth, that caused <hi>Iohn</hi> to fall down as dead, appears farther from his comforting of him, in telling him, that himself <hi>was dead,</hi> but is <hi>now alive,</hi> and has the Keys of Hell and Death, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to fortifie him against the dread of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions, that even then were exercising the Church; and <hi>Iohn</hi> might well suspect that this Vision did por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend greater.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ver.</hi> 19. [The things which thou hast seen] respects the precedent Vision of the seven Churches: The following words [The things that are and shall be hereafter] should be [Both the things which are and shall be hereafter] and so make the Vision con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain both a Literal and Prophetical sense; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the taking of the words in the sense supposed, <hi>viz.</hi> to signifie the past <hi>Ephesine</hi> State of the Church, and the present <hi>Smyrnean</hi> State of it, and the future State of the other Churches, destroys the literal sense, and also spoils the coherence, not onely with the precedent Vision, but also with the following verse.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> This Remark upon the Expositor is very impertinent, he professedly having nothing to doe with the literal sense. But that account which he gives in reference to the Prophetical, is so easie, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained and natural [hast seen] so plainly denoting the time past, that <hi>D. Pareus</hi> on the place writes
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48067:14"/>
thus: <hi>Ità rest Apocalypseos Christus ipse in tres ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes distinguit. Quasdam jam viderat Iohannes inde ab exordio Evangelii sub Nerone &amp; sequentibus Impera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toribus ad Domitianum usque gestas; quasdem in prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senti videbat, majorem partem de futuris porrò visurus erat.</hi> How naturally then, the whole time of the Church being cast into seven Intervals, <hi>Ephesine</hi> past, <hi>Smyrnean</hi> current, <hi>Pergamenian</hi> and the rest to come, are those words [Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things that are, and the things that shall be hereafter] interpreted as the Expositor has inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted them? And how fitly do they cohere with what follows? <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> —and <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>— which being the Accusative case, shews plainly that the seven Candlesticks take in all the seven Intervals of the Church, past, present and to come.</p>

                           <hi>Rem.</hi> 1. The seven Churches in <hi>Asia,</hi> refers not to its signifying <hi>Fundamentum,</hi> thereby to signifie all the Churches that keep the Apostolical foundation in doctrine and practice, for that is implied in calling them Churches, and Christ owns none to be Churches far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than they do so, without which doing they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be united to him, and so cannot be of his Church which is his body. But <hi>Asia</hi> here alludes both to its signifying the <hi>Earth,</hi> and also <hi>Action.</hi> (Of both which see <hi>Exposition of the seven Churches</hi>). So that [to the seven Churches in <hi>Asia</hi>] does signifie, To the seven Churches in their state of <hi>Action</hi> and <hi>Conflict,</hi> or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litant State on Earth; and this in distinction from that blessed state of Rest and Joy in that great Jubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lee of the World the <hi>Millennium,</hi> which the labours
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48067:15"/>
of this <hi>Militant</hi> State will end with. And so the prophetick sense of the Epistles reacheth but to the commencement of the <hi>Millennium.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Ans.</hi> It is sufficient that others would call those <hi>Churches</hi> that did not keep to the <hi>foundation,</hi> but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded doctrines and practices contrary thereto; And therefore <hi>Asia</hi>'s signifying <hi>Fundamentum,</hi> is not need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly superadded to design the truly Catholick Church. That <hi>Asia</hi> signifies <hi>Action,</hi> is granted on both sides; but it is Illogical to deduce <hi>Conflict</hi> from <hi>Action,</hi> and the Arguing <hi>à genere ad speciem,</hi> as if one should say, It is a living Creature, Therefore it is a Man. Though all Conflict is Action, yet all Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not Conflict. This is foisted in to serve a false Hypothesis, and to exclude the <hi>Millennium</hi> out of the Intervals, and to make them reach but to the beginning thereof.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Rem.</hi> 2. There's no need of the <hi>Ephesine</hi> State of the Church its ending at the beginning of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution in <hi>Nero</hi>'s time, but it may continue after, as the <hi>Pergamenian</hi> State does continue through the succeeding Epistles. For as the advancement of the Church to that State was from Christianity's being received by Autority, so the continuing of Autority to profess that Religion is a continuing that State, though from a new emerging condition the Church may receive a new denomination. And so the <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sine</hi> State being agreeable to the whole Primitive time, though the emerging Persecution does give the deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of a new State to the Church, yet it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroys not the former that is consistent therewith. That the <hi>Ephesine</hi> Church was not tainted with <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laitism,</hi> is no Argument that it expired before the beginning of that Sect, but rather of the contrary.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48067:15"/>
For if that Sect was not then in being, it was no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of the Church not to be tainted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, nor could it be said to have it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Ans.</hi> It is sufficient that from a new emerging con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition the Church may receive a new denomination, and so begin a distinct Interval; and thus will the whole Succession of time, from the beginning of the Church to the end of the World, be distinguished into so many Intervals. So limited, as History complying with the characters of the Prophecy, will ratifie, which is all that is intended. And thus the <hi>Ephesine</hi> State or Interval will be naturally terminated upon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of Persecution in <hi>Nero</hi>'s time, the <hi>Smyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean</hi> then beginning; And the <hi>Smyrnean</hi> end upon the emerging of the Church out of persecution by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours turning Christian, and the <hi>Pergamenian</hi> then begin. But, the Church quickly degenerating into Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, and persecuting the Apostolick Christians, and so long a time continuing so, from some remarkable change of the Modes of their Idolatry and Persecution, and other degeneracies of the Church, this <hi>Pergameni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> denomination may cease, and the degenerate Church be called <hi>Thyatirian,</hi> and the true Church be said to be, the Church in <hi>Pergamus,</hi> and the Church in <hi>Thyatira,</hi> because it was within the Jurisdiction of the degenerate Church so denominated, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As for that touching <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colaitism,</hi> it is a mere cavil or quibble. For it plainly was a commendation of the <hi>Ephesine</hi> Interval, that there was not yet that uncleanness found in it that was after set on foot by the <hi>Nicolaitans.</hi> And the <hi>Nicolai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi> being Christians, they could no sooner appear, but the Church <hi>ipso facto</hi> would be defiled by them. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Ephesine</hi> Interval of the Church being now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed by them, it's a sign that Interval comes short of the times of the <hi>Nicolaitans.</hi>

                     <p>THE promise here to the overcomer being one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that <hi>he shall not be hurt of the second Death,</hi> gives no assurance thereby of being partaker of the first Resurrection. The <hi>crown of life</hi> which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to them that are faithfull to death must cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be meant of the reward in the other life. And what reward would it be to the sufferers unto death to have their successours obtain the imperial Crown? Besides, take it to signifie the reward in the other life, and it will so agree with what follows the <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonema,</hi> the one promise explaining the other, whereas the senses here given of both are so diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent as to make them badly sute for promises of the same Epistle.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> The promise here to the overcomer, according to the Elliptical intimations in the Apocalypse is the promise of partaking of the first Resurrection, and so has the ancient Church expounded it. And to ask what reward it would be to the sufferers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to death to have their successours to obtain the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Crown, is to tell us without asking, that <hi>selfishness,</hi> or want of that <hi>unselfinteressed love,</hi> which makes us prefer the publick good of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Christ before our own, causes the Remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker to make such a weak objection as this. And if the Crown of Life, and not being hurt by the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Death explained each other, and were but the same thing, it would be a needless tautology: when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as taken in these different senses it is a double pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48067:16"/>

The <hi>Pergamenian</hi> state commencing at the Emperours professing Christianity, the testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and suffering of <hi>Antipas</hi> is not to be applied to the Pope onely, but does primarily respect that haughty imperious spirit which was generally ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in Patriarchs and Bishops after they grew so great through the protection and favour and bounty of Princes, which begat such fierce conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions amongst themselves and furious ragings against their adversaries or opposers.</p>

                        <hi>Ans.</hi> The sufferings and testimony of <hi>Antipas</hi> does chiefly respect those that were martyred by the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> under the Pope in this Interval, which is bounded by the ending of the War against the <hi>Waldenses</hi> and <hi>Albigenses</hi> which were slain with the sword.

Which time we suppose to commence from the expulsion of the <hi>Goths</hi> out of <hi>Italy</hi> (whose Reign there was the seventh Head that was to continue but a little time) immediately after which the Popes grew so great as to cause the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arches</hi> first to remove to <hi>Ravenna</hi> and after to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd <hi>Italy,</hi> and so prospered with their usurped au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tority as by degrees to make all the foreign Nations

that had overrun the Empire and setled in it to be subject to them. He therefore gaining such rule by his false pretensions to be Christ's Vicar, does evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence the reality of that autority, by usurpation whereof he grew so potent, as also did the <hi>Roman</hi> Hierarchy, who oft proved able to sway the States of Kingdoms, to depose their Kings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Since therefore the usurpers of Christ's autority, grew so potent and prevalent thereby, such as were redeemed from the world to become members of his Kingdom, and so were really accompanied with the power of his spirit proportionably to the state they had attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to, must surely be likewise of great prevalency in their several stations though but of private condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Hence so great power is ascribed to the two Witnesses, <hi>ch.</hi> 11. And hence the great persecution and war at length was raised against the Saints by the Antichristian powers to suppress the emerging power of Christ's Kingdom in them, which fulfilled the other sense of <hi>Thyatira,</hi> by the multitude of Martyrs sacrificed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                        <hi>Ans.</hi> In the Epistle to the Church in <hi>Pergamus</hi> Christ says, <hi>I know thy works and where thou dwellest even where Satan's seat is.</hi> Which undoubtedly is the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> and therefore the Church in <hi>Pergamus</hi> is the Apostolick Church within the jurisdiction of the <hi>Roman</hi> there termed in the Prophetick style <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamenian,</hi> and so undoubtedly <hi>Thyatirian</hi> in this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval. And therefore barely to contradict this with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reason added, is mere wantonness and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour. But now the <hi>Pergamenian</hi> Interval ending in the year 1242, when the Pope's Legate <hi>Amelin</hi> made an end of the <hi>Albigensian</hi> war with <hi>Trancavel,</hi> Bastard-son of the Earl of <hi>Beziers,</hi> what an extravagance is
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48067:18"/>
it to say that the <hi>Thyatirian</hi> Interval began near se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven hundred years before the <hi>Pergamenian</hi> ended? The faithfull Martyr <hi>Antipas</hi> by his account should be slain in the <hi>Thyatirian</hi> Interval, whenas the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy places him in the <hi>Pergamenian.</hi> And that the slaying of <hi>Antipas</hi> respects and typifies those vast slaughters of the <hi>Waldenses</hi> and <hi>Albigenses</hi> with me there is not (nor can there be with any one else that well considers it) the least doubt imaginable; and therefore I make no question but the <hi>Pergame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Interval reaches so far as to include them, whence the <hi>Thyatirian</hi> denomination must of necessity begin after their time, nor can the distinct denominations which constitute the Intervals interfere one with another. Again, a Daughter in the Prophetick style is a delicate Damosel in her flourishing age, not an Infant; and Christ's true Church upon the expulsion of the <hi>Goths</hi> was so far from getting the ascendent o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the worldly powers that she grew more and more enslaved under the power of Antichrist, under the bondage of that <hi>Roman Pharaoh,</hi> than which there is not a more worldly power under the Sun, and was held under this power till the <hi>Sardian</hi> Interval, <hi>viz.</hi> till the rising of the Witnesses, that is to say, till the late happy reformation begun by <hi>Luther, &amp;c.</hi> This therefore is a very rude rush against manifest truth, as if the Remarker did not mark what he did or said. Else he would not say that the <hi>Popes</hi> caused the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arches</hi> to remove their seat to <hi>Ravenna,</hi> whenas no Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story that I meet with makes any mention of any other seat of them but that. But such slips as these I could willingly wink at, if the main of the remark had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny solidity in it.

For they gained no power thereby, but freedom onely from the thraldom they were formerly under. But if this respects any thing of the Reformation, (which I conceive it does not, and that the <hi>Thyati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> Interval reaches not so far) it must signifie the chief leaders in the Reformation, who through the cause of God they were engaged in attained to bear so great sway and make so great changes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

And the ruling them with a rod of iron, and breaking them a-pieces like a Potter's Vessel, is shattering a-pieces the Antichristian Compages they were held together in before, and subjecting them to the Gospel of Christ: this shall be effected upon several Nations, that were before Paganochristian, in the <hi>Sardian</hi> Interval.

And they are so far from signifying several states of the Church, that the one is spoken onely of Christ himself, <hi>viz.</hi> he calls himself the bright Morning-star. But what the Morning-star is which is promised to the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comers in the <hi>Thyatirian</hi> Church, is hardly to be understood farther than we are partakers thereof, but seems to be of like signification with 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19. both seeming to respect an addition of light of life to the light of truth before received.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> There's but one Morning star indeed, which is Christ, who is here signified, but in a political consideration as Prince of his Empire on Earth, which may have degrees of largeness and lustre. And that Christ is here understood in a Political sense the foregoing verse intimates, that speaks of the enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Kingdom.

of the <hi>Epiphonema</hi> farther assures us accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the rule noted in the <hi>Exposition of the seven Churches.</hi> And where Christ is called the bright Morning star, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 22.16. it is not spoke there simply of his Person, abstracting from his Kingdom on Earth, because he says immediately before it, I am the off-spring of <hi>David,</hi> which is a challenging his right to all the Kingdoms of the Earth upon that score of his descent from <hi>David</hi> the King to whom God had made the promise, <hi>Ps.</hi> 2.

But in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Verse, the being <hi>cloathed in white rayment,</hi> which is the same with <hi>walking in white</hi> is taken in a different sense, <hi>viz.</hi> to be prosperous in the propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the affairs of Christ's Kingdom. Also in the said following verse, those words, <hi>I will not blot his name out of the book of life,</hi> which interpret the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going words, (<hi>viz.</hi> that the walking in white, and the being cloathed with white rayment, is the walking in the light of life, whereby we become heirs of the crown of life, and so written in the book of life) are yet taken to signifie a continued succession of such men to the end of the world, whereas the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of such a succession is no reward to the <hi>Sardian</hi> Church, though it may be joy to them as they are concerned for the propagation of Religion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> If there be any Errour in this Interpretation, it is, in that the Expositor has not expounded [to walk with me in white] in the same sense he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded [to be cloathed in white rayment] which has a Political sense, and signifies the good success of affairs with them. For the Remarker was to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that the Expositor was giving the <hi>prophetical</hi> sense of these Epistles, not the <hi>literal, moral,</hi> or <hi>spiritual.</hi> And that therefore according to that solid Rule set down, That the Declarations touching the success of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48067:20"/>
the Church that is writ to, before the <hi>Epiphonema,</hi> signifies <hi>politically,</hi> so this being <hi>cloathed in white</hi> is to be expounded accordingly. But being <hi>whiteness,</hi> signifies as well <hi>Innocency</hi> as <hi>Prosperity,</hi> and Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is a fitting these few names in <hi>Sardis</hi> for their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperous success, that I made use of these different sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications so well subordinated one to another, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves not to be cavilled at, but rather to be approved. And correspondently to this <hi>Prophetical</hi> sense which must be <hi>Political</hi> [I will not blot his name out of the book of life] is to be understood, that these few names are the durable seed of such a Church as shall last to the end of the World. But to say, this is no reward to them that they have such a durable suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession, is a reproach to the Remarker, as if he were a stranger to the true Christian State, and knew not the gratifications of a soul regenerate into the living Image of Christ, who with his Church is one my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical body in succession through all ages; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what any part of them suffer for the present, if it make for the greater good of the Church for the future, they take themselves to be amply rewarded by so happy an event. And such a success as causes joy to them, as the Remarker acknowledges, must be a proportionable good to them, and if consequent upon their labours and sufferings, a reward thereof. So that such Allegations as these are mere affected Cavils.</p>

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48067:21"/>
of our Lord as never to fall. Both this and the four following verses do shew the <hi>Philadelphian</hi> Church to be in a Militant State in progress to the victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous state of rest and glory in the <hi>Millennium.</hi> And what is said in these verses, is spoken of the entire State of the <hi>Philadelphian</hi> Church, and therefore cannot be referred to the seventh vial as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement thereof. But to instance in their signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying a Militant State, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The promise, <hi>v.</hi> 9. <hi>to make them of the Synagogue of Satan, who say they are Iews, to come and worship,</hi> &amp;c. does plainly shew the Church to be in conflict with such Enemies as pretend to be true Christians, and yet refuse subjection to the true Church, which cannot agree with the Millennial State, when Satan shall be bound and all Enemies put under the feet of Christ, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The promise, <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>to keep from the hour of Temptation that shall come upon all the world,</hi> &amp;c. does evidence and a State far different from that of the <hi>Millennium,</hi> and does seem to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie that time of great trouble precedent thereto, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. The promise also, <hi>v.</hi> 11. <hi>to come quickly and warning to hold fast,</hi> &amp;c. does also plainly shew that the time of the <hi>Millennium,</hi> when God will reward all his servants, <hi>ch.</hi> 11.18. is not then come, though it be near approaching. And the several promises, <hi>v.</hi> 12. made to him that overcometh, do also evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence the Church to be then, as we have said, in a Militant State. The first of those promises, <hi>viz.</hi> to make the overcomer <hi>a Pillar in the Temple of God,</hi> seems to signifie, that he shall be of great Rule and Autority. For the Worshippers in the Temple do chiefly respect the Mosaical or ruling judicial office, as we shew, <hi>ch.</hi> 11.1. The next promise, <hi>viz. He shall go no more out,</hi> &amp;c. does plainly signifie a Militant
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:48067:21"/>
State, which he that overcometh is promised a cessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and rest from. The three following promises are all much to the same purpose, signifying the great manifestation of the glory of God in such as over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, whereby it shall be visible to all to whom they belong, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                        <hi>Ans.</hi> Here again the Remarker forgetting that we are upon the <hi>Prophetical</hi> sense of these Epistles, writhes his fancy into a <hi>Moral</hi> or <hi>Spiritual</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, though I will not take notice from what kind of spirit this may be. Most undoubtedly the <hi>prophetical</hi> sense of this eighth verse is <hi>Political,</hi> and denotes the uncontrollable success of the Church of <hi>Philadelphia.</hi> But to wrest it to a <hi>Moral</hi> or <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi> sense, as it is a Prophecy, is to doe violence to the scope of the Holy Ghost therein. This <hi>little force</hi> or <hi>army,</hi> as it is indeed little compared with the other great appearance at the battel of the great Day of God Almighty, are no other than those that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the noble Heros on the white Horse, <hi>Apoc. ch.</hi> 19. and the <hi>Boanerges</hi>'s thundring over the great City, divided into three parts. So that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of this <hi>Philadelphian</hi> Interval is in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Vial, but reaches to the fourth Thunder. Which consideration silences all the pretended Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonings of the Remarker, against the <hi>Philadelphian</hi> Intervals comprehending the <hi>Millennial</hi> Reign of Christ. For the entire State of the <hi>Philadelphian</hi> Church is comprised in that Interval according to our Hypothesis, and according to Truth, as shall appear. I say therefore briefly, that I acknowledge the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphian</hi> Church in part of her Interval to be <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litant,</hi> that is to the expiration of the seventh Vial or first Thunder. But under the second Thunder ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48067:22"/>
to promise she obtains the Title of the <hi>City of God,</hi> which is the <hi>new Ierusalem, which cometh down out of Heaven from God,</hi> just as it is described, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 21.11. What can be more plain and express? <hi>Philadelphia</hi> therefore must be this <hi>new Ierusalem,</hi> as sure as Christ will keep faith in his promises. So that the <hi>Philadelphian</hi> Interval reaches so far as the second Thunder inclusively. But that it reacheth through the <hi>Millennium</hi> also, may appear to the unprejudiced from what follows. [And I will write upon him my new Name] where <hi>Grotius</hi> expresly upon this very passage says. <hi>Hoc novum nomen Christi est</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. This new name of Christ is, <hi>King of Kings and Lord of Lords.</hi> Which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore must undoubtedly respect his Millennial Empire, which yet is given to this <hi>Philadelphian</hi> Church in whom he shall thus reign. And <hi>Grotius</hi> again, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 19.16. <hi>Hoc est nomen illud novum,</hi> says he, <hi>quod innui,</hi> cap. 3.12. <hi>Verè</hi> novum <hi>si non jus spectes, sed juris eventum.</hi> For though he had always a right, yet then at last he was in full possession when his Millen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Empire was erected, which was a <hi>new</hi> thing, and not before, and he but <hi>newly</hi> actual King of Kings and Lord of Lords.</p>
                     <p>But besides this (keeping still to the <hi>prophetical</hi> sense, which is undoubtedly <hi>Political,</hi>) That first promise, <hi>Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the Temple of my God, and he shall go no more out,</hi> implies plainly the perpetuity of the <hi>Philadelphian</hi> Church to the Worlds end, though otherwise modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd and differently denominated in the <hi>Laodicean</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval. Here, <hi>Him that overcomes,</hi> respects the whole body of the <hi>Philadelphian</hi> Church, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Philadelphian</hi> Church shall reach to the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:48067:22"/>
Worlds end, though it afterward vary in modifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and denomination, namely, after the expiration of the <hi>Millennium.</hi> He must wilfully wink, and perversely shut his eyes that sees not this truth clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly already. And the Remarker seems to doe so in so violently wresting the signification of a <hi>Pillar in the Temple of God,</hi> which so naturally signifies sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and permanency, to the signifying great Rule and Autority, upon a dark private notion of his own, <hi>ch.</hi> 11.1. (which we will examine when we come to it) as if he were wiser than Christ, and knew his meaning better than himself. For he plainly expounds this <hi>Pillar,</hi> of <hi>stability</hi> and <hi>perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency</hi> in saying, <hi>And he shall go no more out.</hi> So stable and permanent shall this <hi>Philadelphian</hi> State be, as a Pillar in a Temple, whose removal would hazard the whole Edifice. And this terrestrial Scene shall fail so soon as this <hi>Philadelphian</hi> Church shall cease to be. This passage he thus mis-interprets, and those other that are so close and home to the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness he shuffles off with this general account, <hi>That they manifest the glory of God in them that overcome.</hi> But they manifest such a glory as belongs to the <hi>new Ierusalem</hi> and the <hi>Millennial</hi> Empire of Christ, if we can assure our selves of the sense of any passage from the easie, plain and natural signification of words and expressions.</p>
                     <p>And now as I was going to say, let us add to all this, That as the <hi>Ephesine</hi> Interval represents the truly Catholick and Apostolick Church as something de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining in her zeal and fervour, and threatned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with Persecution: And as the <hi>Smyrnean</hi> Interval represents her in her Persecution under the Pagan Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction, but quitting her self couragiously and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48067:23"/>
victoriously upon promised success, that their suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings would win the Imperial Crown at last, and the Roman Empire turn Christian; As the <hi>Pergamenian</hi> Interval represents the same Church exalted out of her Pagan Persecutions, but, upon the degeneracy of the Church into Superstition, Idolatry and Cruelty, suffering again under a Paganochristian Jurisdiction. And as the next Interval, <hi>viz. Thyatirian,</hi> represents the said Catholick and Apostolick Church suffering under the same Paganochristian Jurisdiction, but quitting themselves nobly, supported by the promise, that these sufferers under <hi>Pergamus</hi> and <hi>Thyatira</hi> shall have the rule and possession of whole Nations at the next turn of things, and Respit from their Persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Martyrdoms, <hi>viz.</hi> in the <hi>Sardian</hi> Interval: In which there is no complaint of eating things sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed unto Idols, as in the <hi>Pergamenian</hi> and <hi>Thyati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> Intervals, nor any Intimations of Martyrdom for not complying therewith, but onely a complaint of that Imperfection of state and signal remisness from what they were at first when newly come out of their sufferings. Which <hi>Sardian</hi> Interval there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore does plainly represent the state of the Catholick Church emerged out of the gross corruptions and barbarous persecutions of the Roman Church, though themselves yet are not so good as they should be; although there be in it some few Names, some few excellent Persons that are as it were the seed of a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter state of the true Church to come, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, say I, as these five Intervals represent the state of the truly Catholick and Apostolick Church, so plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, amply and lively, so does the <hi>Philadelphian</hi> Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val the succeeding state thereof, where is not onely no Idolatry to be tempted to, nor any Martyrdom
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48067:23"/>
for refusing to comply therewith, but also no spot nor wrinkle, nor any such thing but it is entirely holy and without blemish. This is the description of the sixth Interval or Succession of States in the Church Catholick and Apostolick. And therefore I demand here of any man that has any spark of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and sagacity left in him, what time this can be but such that includes in it the <hi>Ierusalem</hi> State and blessed Millennial Empire of Christ, which cannot be more pure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> perfect and glorious than this State of the <hi>Philadelphian</hi> Church. Which is a Prophetical description of some state of the Church as is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged on both hands, and which is to succeed the <hi>Sardian,</hi> and also that there will be a blessed <hi>Millen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium</hi> on Earth. Wherefore this consideration alone might assure us of this truth. But when there is farther added; That on him that overcomes, (that is on the <hi>Philadelphian</hi> Church) <hi>I will write the name of the City of my God, which is new Ierusalem, which cometh down out of Heaven from my God,</hi> &amp;c. Can it be any thing but affected stupour or some strange invincible prejudice, (a Prophetical sense being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd) that any one should doubt but that the times of the New <hi>Ierusalem</hi> and <hi>Millennial</hi> Empire of Christ are included in the <hi>Philadelphian</hi> Interval, which was the thing to be demonstrated.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vers.</hi> 20, 21. Christ's coming in to sup with them that open to his knocking, does signifie his receiving them to his Marriage-supper. And his granting to them that overcome to sit down on his Throne, sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies their reigning with him in the <hi>Millennium.</hi> And these being two promises to the same purpose to be fulfilled in the <hi>Millennial</hi> State, and being made to the victorious in the <hi>Laodicean</hi> Church,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:48067:24"/>
does manifest the same to be in a militant state pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent to the <hi>Millennium.</hi> Nor is the degeneracy of the <hi>Laodicean</hi> Church competent to the <hi>Millennial</hi> state, of which there's no account that there should be any such change in it, nor is it imaginable how it should, it being established in that glorious state of righteousness as is described, and having all occasion of evil removed by the Devil's being bound and all things being made new. And though he be to be loosed again, yet it is not to deceive or work any change in those that belong to the new <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> but to seduce the Nations about it, who through his deceit are to be stirred up in enmity against it, though before they brought their glory into it and walkt in the light of it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> To pervert the genuine sense of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, here the Remarker interprets that <hi>Politically</hi> that he should interpret Mystically or <hi>Spiritually</hi> as he has in other places interpreted that <hi>Spiritually</hi> which should have been expounded <hi>Politically.</hi> So sinuous and serpentine a thing is beloved falshood. From v. 15. to v. 20. The declension of the <hi>Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phian</hi> state after the <hi>Millennium</hi> in their remisness in pursuing spiritual gifts and graces, and breathing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the living image of Christ in themselves and in their propagating of his Kingdom, is prefigured or predescribed (the Church being depressed then into a new denomination of <hi>Laodicean</hi>) and they sharply rebuked and terribly threatned if they do not repent of these immoralities or <hi>Dispiritualities,</hi> if I may so speak. And thus continuedly in the same <hi>Moral</hi> sense he still farther upbraids them, that though he, by the searching rebukes of his spirit, knocks at the door of their Consciences to awaken
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:48067:24"/>
them out of their remisness and litherly formalness, yet they are insensible of his call, being satisfied to ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate the Lord's Supper without idolatry still indeed, (as it was in the Popish Mass) but also without any breathing after the fruits thereof, our living union with Christ and spiritual Communion with him; and yet he tells them for their comfort as well as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves them, that if they will open to him through constant obedience to his dictates that they shall ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enjoy his communion and be in a truly living u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Spirit with him, which is the true meaning and scope of the Lord's Supper, and which will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover them again into that wholsome state the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphians</hi> stuck to universally in the former Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val. That this is thus <hi>Spiritually</hi> or Morally to be understood and not <hi>Politically,</hi> as the Marriage Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Lamb is, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 19.7, 8, 9. is farther ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest in that it is said, <hi>If any one hear my voice and open the door, I will come in to him and will sup with him and he with me, viz.</hi> at his home; they will sup together there, which therefore is no invitation of the party abroad to sup. Wherefore what a fond thing is this to apply Christ's coming into our hearts and Souls, and entertaining there spiritual Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with us, such as is signified by the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Lord's Supper, unto that <hi>Political</hi> sense of things, the Jews adjoining themselves to the Church of Christ, and acknowledging him their Messias, their Head and Husband in the above cited place? This is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normously to strain and pervert the sense of Scripture.</p>
                     <p>As is also that conceit of interpreting [to sit down on his throne] of their reigning with him in the <hi>Millennium.</hi> For being there is no mention here of such conflicts and persecutions and martyrdoms in
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:48067:25"/>
this <hi>Laodicean</hi> state, to which an earthly deliverance and victory, and an earthly crown and dominion was promised in the <hi>Smyrnean, Pergamenian</hi> and <hi>Thyatirian</hi> Intervals, nor any mention of the word of Patience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the throne that is here promised must be of another nature, that is, a place or seat in Heaven as universally it is interpreted by Expositors. And being the conflict the <hi>Laodiceans</hi> are here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted to is the subduing their carnal minds and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and through mortification to be renewed unto the Heavenly image of Christ by the spirit of life in the new birth, which is the true and onely me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of attaining to this Heavenly Throne or Crown of glory, it is very unnatural to understand it of any other Throne than that. But they being roused thus up by the exhortation of Christ to shake off that dulness and torpor of spirit and dead formality and carnality, and to be enlivened again into a quick sense of their duty by virtue of their Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration into his living image, that of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> ch. 2. will be fulfilled in them. <hi>When we were dead in our sins he hath quickened us toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with Christ, and hath raised us up together and made us sit</hi> (there is the promised <hi>Throne</hi>) <hi>together in Heavenly places in Christ Iesus.</hi> And that it is an Heavenly seat or Throne, that passage in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, does naturally insinuate accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that in the <hi>[Te Deum] When thou hadst o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome the sharpness of death thou didst open the Kingdom of Heaven to all believers.</hi> His ascending into Heaven and sitting at the right hand of God was the consequence of his sufferings. In which Heaven there are many seats or mansions, as he elsewhere tells us, which undoubtedly he has prepared for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:48067:25"/>
one that overcomes. As Christ after he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came, sate down in his father's Throne which he gave him; so all judgment being given to the son, he that overcomes shall sit down in a Throne or seat in Heaven of Christ's giving, as <hi>Grotius</hi> seems to interpret the words. For it is most natural to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Throne of Christ and of other Victors, though not of equal majesty and glory, yet to be of the same nature, that is to say, Heavenly, as the current of Expositors runs. And it was an <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly</hi> Throne Christ ascended after he had overcome, not an <hi>Earthly</hi> Millennial Throne, which according to the Remarker, he had not obtained in the <hi>Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicean</hi> Interval, whenas he says expresly he was sate down already in the Throne his Father gave him upon his overcoming. And therefore the like Thrones he promiseth other overcomers.</p>
                     <p>And lastly, it being so plainly demonstrated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that the <hi>Millennium</hi> is comprised in the <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphian</hi> Interval, it is impossible that this Throne promised to the <hi>Laodicean</hi> Victor should be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of reigning with Christ in the <hi>Millennium.</hi> So that I conceive it is plain enough, that as this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistolar Prophecy is acknowledged by the Remarker to reach from the beginning of the Church to the commencement of the <hi>Millennium,</hi> so upon better reason that it reacheth to the end of the world. For when the slate of the Church is divided into so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny successions, and prefigured in a Prophetical man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, why should two such notable Intervals as that of the <hi>Millennium</hi> and the after game of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gog, &amp;c.</hi> be omitted? It were a rude and immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest thing in me to suppose the spirit of Prophecy defectuous in this point rather than suspect mine
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:48067:26"/>
own judgment and slowness that may hinder my discerning the completeness and perfection of this Prophecy.</p>
                     <p>But the Remarker produces reasons why we should think the Prophecy of the seven Churches reaches no farther than the commencement of the <hi>Millennium.</hi> The first is, Because Christ invites the <hi>Laodiceans</hi> to the Marriage supper of the Lamb, and promises the Overcomer a Throne in the <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lennium.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Second, That there is no account given that the <hi>Millennial</hi> state should ever degenerate into the <hi>Laodicean.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly and lastly, That it is unimaginable that the <hi>Millennium,</hi> being established in that glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous state of Righteousness that is described, and all occasions of evil removed, the Devil being bound, nor to be let loose again upon those that belong to the new <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> but onely upon the Nations; that the <hi>Millennial</hi> state should degenerate into the <hi>Laodicean.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But I have already answered the first by shewing that Christ's promising to sup with him that opens to him the door is no invitation to the Marriage Supper of the Lamb, nor the promised Throne an Earthly Throne in the <hi>Millennium,</hi> but a promise of the Heavenly Kingdom which this Throne signifies. According as our Saviour promises his Apostles, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. <hi>I appoint unto you a Kingdom as my father has appointed unto me</hi> (which hugely fits this place, <hi>To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my Throne, even as I also overcame and am sate down with my father in his Throne</hi>) <hi>that ye may eat and drink at my Table in my Kingdom, and sit on Thrones
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:48067:26"/>
judging the twelve Tribes of Israel.</hi> Which place is parallel to that of <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.28. <hi>Verily I say unto you, ye that have followed me, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>,</hi> (which <hi>Grotius</hi> expounds by <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, and <hi>Munster</hi> by <hi>Resurrectio Mortuorum</hi>; and <hi>Calvin</hi> says, <hi>Non dubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um est quin hîc de extremo die loquatur Christus</hi>) <hi>at the Resurrection when the Son of Man shall sit on the Throne of his glory, ye also shall sit on twelve Thrones judging the twelve Tribes of Israel.</hi> So that this is also a Throne of <hi>Iudicature,</hi> a <hi>Laodicean</hi> Throne, from which this Interval in one respect has its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination, because at the close thereof Christ with his Saints will judge the people, which makes this promise the more suitable. And that the Saints should have their Thrones of Judicature then to judge the people with Christ no man can much mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel at, that considers that of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.3. <hi>Know ye not that we shall judge the Angels?</hi> that we shall be co-approvers of the sentence of Christ against the Devils and wicked Souls at the last day? which shews how fitly, unforcedly and naturally this Throne here promised is understood of the Heavenly Throne, as I have demonstrated it cannot be understood of an Earthly Throne in the <hi>Millennium.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To the second I answer, That there is a very good account out of the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> to be given why we should think that the <hi>Millennial</hi> or <hi>Philadelphian</hi> estate will at last degenerate into the <hi>Laodicean.</hi> It is true there is no express imputation of any fault up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the beloved City in the Prophecy of the <hi>opened Book,</hi> but that after the <hi>Millennium</hi> there is a change of affairs is thence plain, it telling us of the loosing of the Devil, and the endeavours of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> to subdue the Holy City, but the reason in that
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:48067:27"/>
Prophecy is omitted, and it is the artifice of conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> to omit things in one Vision and supply them in another, and the supplement is manifest in this Vision of the seven Churches. For the <hi>Laodicean</hi> Interval succeeding the <hi>Philadelphian</hi> which I have demonstrated to include in it the <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lennial</hi> Reign of Christ, must needs synchronize with that state of the Church which is after the <hi>Millennial</hi> Empire. Wherefore the reproofs of the Church of <hi>Laodicea</hi> for their Lukewarmness and Remisness in the affairs of the Kingdom of Christ, and neglecting to retain and propagate that inward state of the spirit of life in the new birth, but resting in a dead, formal, though otherwise unexceptionable, external worship of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this shews the reason of the Devil's being let loose again, that he might raise stirs against the Church, and so they might reflect upon their condition, and repent them of their Lukewarmness and Remisness. Which Hypothesis is more agreeable to the <hi>Iustice</hi> of God and his <hi>care</hi> over his Church, than that he should loose the Devil again and raise storms against his Church no man knows why nor wherefore.</p>
                     <p>To the last I answer, that it is very easily concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable, though the Church does at last become so pure and spotless, so holy and righteous, yet that in process of time it may decline. <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, In this state of mortality nothing can be absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly firm and durable. Did not the blessed Angels who were created in unspeakable purity and glory fall from their station? who yet had no Tempter from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, for there were no Devils that needed to be tied up before the Angels fell. Wherefore as to that point they had as much advantage as the <hi>Philadelphian</hi>
                        <pb n="31" facs="tcp:48067:27"/>
Church, but exceeding much more in being <hi>Spirit</hi> and not <hi>Flesh.</hi> But the <hi>Philadelphian</hi> Church will be mortal flesh as other sons of <hi>Adam.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in long process of time they may well dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate something even before the loosing of the Devil out of Prison. And when he is loose again, it is but a precarious surmise to think he can act onely upon the Nations that are not in communion with the Church. For when he is loose he is as he was before he was imprisoned. Nor is there any ground to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain the word [Nations] to those onely that are not in visible communion with the Church, but it may very naturally signifie that multitude of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and People in the World whether of the Church or not. And it is a rash presumption to suppose that the Nations that walk in the light of the new <hi>Ierusalem</hi> are not converts to the Christian Faith, forasmuch as they are said to be <hi>saved</hi>; or the Kings of the Earth that bring their glory into it that they are not whole Kingdoms converted to the Christian belief as that auspicious acclamation foretells, <hi>that the Kingdoms of the World are become the Kingdoms of the Lord, and of his Christ,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore we see that there is not the least sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of reason, but that the Prophecy of the seven Churches is a Prophecy of the state of the Church distinguished into seven Intervals from the beginning of the Church to the end of the World. Which may the better assure us that the two Prophecies, the one of the <hi>sealed Book,</hi> the other of the <hi>opened Book,</hi> are so likewise.</p>

                        <hi>Ans.</hi> The Song of Thanksgiving is this, <hi>ch.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 9. <hi>For thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy bloud out of every kindred and tongue, and people, and nation.</hi> What wonderfull weak arguing is this? Because the Kings out of every Nation are redeemed by the bloud of Christ, and publickly confess the same, therefore they are no more Kings of any Nation than the common people that are so redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. As if true Christianity took away all subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Ranks and Degrees in the world. Why
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:48067:29"/>
then have they not all Crowns, if they be all Kings alike? or why has any so? Who grosly perverts Scripture now? And what does the Remarker mean by <hi>worldly Princes?</hi> If he means worldly-minded Princes, this contradicts the Scene of things here, which is a Representation of the <hi>Millennial</hi> Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Holiness upon Earth, and therefore these four and twenty crowned Elders or Monarchs are not supposed worldly-minded. If he makes them <hi>world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Princes,</hi> because they are still in the world, that is, on the Earth; that's a contradiction to Christ's Millennial reign on Earth, The <hi>Millennium</hi> must be in Heaven then, not on Earth. If subordination of Ranks and Degrees, from the Prince to the Pezant, make them worldly Princes, the Polity in Heaven is worldly. For there is a subordinate Hierarchy of Angels there, and Archangels, of Powers, Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palities, Dominions and Thrones, <hi>Colos.</hi> 1.6. and so the Millennial Reign will be no where. O but it is said in the following verse, <hi>And hast made us to our God Kings and Priests, and we shall reign upon the Earth. Ans.</hi> This questionless alludes to that which God commanded <hi>Moses</hi> to tell the children of <hi>Israel</hi> touching him, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.6. And ye shall be to me a Kingdom of Priests, which is called a Royal Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. and the Apocalypse more distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly styles the true Church in those happy days <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Priests.</hi> But as under <hi>Moses</hi> the Nation being called a Kingdom of Priests, it did not confound the distinction betwixt Priest and People, but <hi>Aaron</hi> was the High Priest, and had other Priests under him, And <hi>Moses</hi> was <hi>King</hi> in <hi>Iesurun,</hi> and had the heads of the Tribes under him; so the four and twenty Elders, and the four Beasts, the whole body of the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:48067:29"/>
Church joining together in this Doxology, <hi>Thou hast made us Kings and Priests, and we shall reign upon Earth,</hi> does not confound (with him that has a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct understanding) the subordinate degrees and ranks of men, but there may be <hi>Kings,</hi> and <hi>Bishops,</hi> and <hi>Priests</hi> that are in another sense so, than the common people are. Therefore this ground is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly too weak to support such a monstrous Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radox in Theology and Politicks. That the reign of the <hi>Messias</hi> alters not the course of Nature, but sanctifies it and makes it holy, is an opinion of some of the best of the Rabbins. And to give unnatural Expositions of Prophecies, is to cast a Mist before the eyes of men, that they will not be able to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern when they are fulfilled. As if the <hi>Millennium</hi> will never be till Princes be no more Kings than the people; As the <hi>Iews</hi> fansie the times of the Messias, not yet come, because the Lyon does not yet eat Hay with the Oxe.</p>

                        <hi>Vers.</hi> 6. The Sea of Glass being the Laver of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, does not signifie the condition of those that are regenerated thereby, but that which does regenerate them, <hi>viz.</hi> that Manifestation of God in our Lord Jesus, the glory of which we beholding as in a glass, are changed into the same Image from glory to glory.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> Why may not the Laver of Regeneration signifie the condition of those that are regenerate? For, <hi>qualis causa talis effectus.</hi> Why may not then the quality of the one signifie the quality of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? The pure transparent Laver of Regeneration, the purity of the Regenerate, and their pervious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to be shined into and illuminated by the Spirit of God. This is spoke more within compass than
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:48067:30"/>
the Remarker's turning the Font into a Looking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glass, especially if we consider that Sea signifies a Body of people. Besides, according to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marker's own self, The manifestation of the glory of Christ regenerating us into his own Image, and so we becoming like Christ; that which represents him that regenerates, represents us also regenerated into his Image; whence it is plain, that the Sea of Glass represents the Regenerate people, and that the Remarker contradicts himself.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> It is a childish thing to think that the book seen by <hi>Iohn</hi> was written with all those words con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Apocalypse, but it was a symbol of the Compages of those Prophetical <hi>Representations,</hi> and of the <hi>inward meaning</hi> of them contained in the mind of Christ and the Holy Angel sent to <hi>Iohn.</hi> Now as the Book in general was a symbol of the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurative Representations, and the inward meaning
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:48067:30"/>
of them in the mind of the Angel, that is to say, of the inward Prophetical sense of them; so the being writ <hi>within</hi> and <hi>without</hi> distinctly signifies, the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the external Representations and Symbols of the Prophecies, and the being writ within the real pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical sense of the figures and symbols. And of the being writ <hi>within</hi> and <hi>without,</hi> that this is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural sense of it, is moreover manifest, because all the ancient Interpreters have been harping much upon that string or something like it. S. <hi>Ierom</hi> amongst the rest will have this Book to signifie the Scripture: and the being writ <hi>within</hi> and <hi>without</hi> to signifie the <hi>literal</hi> and <hi>mystical</hi> sense. But certainly this sense which I have given is much more natural, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strains it to this present Book of Prophecies, and to the <hi>symbolical</hi> sense and <hi>real prophetical</hi> sense there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. To take away this sense, and tell us onely that the matter not being able to be contained in the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side</hi> of the rolled Book, the rest was fain to be writ on the <hi>outside,</hi> so that it was <hi>Liber opisthographus,</hi> is either to trifle or doe worse, to reproach the Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man as either over-sparing of his Parchment, or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen in the proportioning it to his matter. But this intimation of these two senses I have noted is <hi>usefull</hi> and <hi>weighty,</hi> whereby the vanity and madness of those Interpreters is discovered that confound the <hi>symboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> sense with the <hi>real</hi> or Prophetical, as <hi>R.

And this of our Remarker's is of little more weight than the rest, <hi>viz.</hi> That written <hi>within</hi> and <hi>without</hi> must mean the disposal of the Prophecy of the <hi>opened Book with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,</hi> and that of the <hi>Seals and Trumpets without.</hi> To what purpose is this Intimation?

                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> If twenty Beasts stood round about the Throne, the Lamb could stand betwixt the Throne, and but one Beast. And the Lamb may be said to stand betwixt the Throne and the Beasts, though he stood but betwixt the Throne and one Beast, as is manifest both out of phrase of Scripture and common speech, so that that is but a slight exception.

                     <p>THE warfare of this Conqueror is not spiritual, but his Conquering signifies his victories over the <hi>Iews</hi> by the Roman Armies, whereby he fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led what he had foretold of <hi>sending forth his armies to destroy those Murtherers,</hi> &amp;c. And his, <hi>to conquer,</hi> signifies his like success against the Roman Empire by the seven Trumpets and Vials, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                        <hi>Ans.</hi> The Prophecy of the seven Churches com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mences from the very beginning of the Church upon Christ's Ascension, and sending upon the Apostles the Holy Ghost. Wherefore there is more humour than judgment to thwart Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s Interpretation of the Rider of the white Horse with a bow in his hand, to whom a Crown was given, the <hi>Imperial Crown</hi> no doubt. For the aim of his War was to turn the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Empire Christian, which was effected under the sixth Seal. Which Rider of the white Horse Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> understands of Christ. Wherefore when Christ up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his powring down the Holy Ghost had fitted his chief Commanders in this Evangelical warfare, to carry on the design of converting the Empire to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, why should not he be this noble Heros on the white Horse, not <hi>F. Vespasianus,</hi> nor <hi>Titus,</hi> his Son, who sack'd <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> thus making the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy to commence forty years later than it should? The warfare therefore of this Conqueror is both <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual,</hi> or Evangelical, and <hi>Political</hi>; that is to say, the external guidance of affairs, as his moving <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spasian</hi> to his Wars against the <hi>Iews,</hi> and giving him
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:48067:32"/>
that success is in order to the propagation of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel through the Empire. And it is well known that <hi>Iulian,</hi> to hinder the growth of the Gospel, encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged the <hi>Iews</hi> to rebuild their Temple. But this noble Heros on the white Horse, by his invisible Powers miraculously defeated the design, as you may see in <hi>Ammianus Marcellinus.</hi> The stretching his <hi>go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth conquering and to conquer,</hi> to the seven Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets and Vials seems to me a forcing of the Text (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond its proper intention) needless and impertinent. Christ was so far from a conquering condition under the Trumpets, that his two great Enemies, <hi>Mahomet</hi> and <hi>Antichrist,</hi> had in a manner over-run his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in those times.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vers.</hi> 8. <hi>Fourth part,</hi> is not here used, because the destruction did not reach over all the Empire, for some of the Trumpets which reached but part of the Empire, are said to fall upon the third part of the Earth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> because a third part is used as a Symbol of the Empire.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> But where is [a fourth part] used for a Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bol of the Empire? Wherefore it is plain there is not the like Reason in both. And a fourth part of the Earth being less than a third part of the Earth, it is plain that a portion less than the whole Empire is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated thereby.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vers.</hi> 12. The <hi>Civil</hi> Autority, and not the <hi>Draco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick</hi> Majesty, is the Sun, and the <hi>Priesthood</hi> is the Moon; and the Draconick Majesty exercising its Autority in both, is included in both.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> This is dictated, not proved. If the <hi>Draco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick</hi> Majesty influence by his Autority both the <hi>Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood</hi> and the <hi>Secular</hi> Magistracy, there is then one Sun and two Moons. For derived Autority is mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atitious,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:48067:32"/>
as the light of the Moon, and that which derives it, is as the light of the Sun, innate and Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal. But the secular Moon is not considered in this Vision. It lay upon the Remarker to prove it.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> The Kings of the Earth, and great Men, and chief Captains calling to the Rocks and Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> does not signifie a dissolution of the Secular Magistracies, but it sets out the fear of those great Men that would support by their Arms the Pagan Religion; who though they perished some of them in the quarrel, yet the constitution of the Empire as to <hi>Seculars,</hi> continued still the same, the same Orders and Offices, <hi>Emperours, Consuls,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>THE first six Trumpets cannot (as the Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction to this Chapter makes them) be a vengeance on the Roman Empire for persecuting the Primitive Christians, because it was destroy'd (<hi>viz.</hi> The Western Empire which is here intended) by the three first of them. The fourth is upon <hi>Rome,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the seventh Head, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Ostrogothian</hi> Kings; the fifth and sixth do concern both the Greek Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire and the Ten-horned Beast under the eighth Head. Also it is unagreeable with the making the Christian Emperours the seventh Head, by reason of the Church being then Symmetral. For it is unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable that the Empire being then in so regular a condition as is supposed, should be punished for its former Irregularities. But the <hi>Ostrogoths</hi> were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the seventh Head, as will be afterward shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> If the Expositor had said all the six Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets were a vengeance on the Roman Empire for persecuting the Primitive Christians, the Objection had been the more valid. But he says onely, <hi>In the time of the six Trumpets vengeance is taken,</hi> &amp;c. And I think if the Western Empire was destroy'd by the three first of them, vengeance is pretty well taken of the Empire. And if the Greek Empire and Ten-horned Beast, of which the Greek Empire is part, be concerned in the fifth and sixth Trumpets, ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance is farther taken of that Empire that was the Murtherer of the Primitive Martyrs: In which
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:48067:33"/>
many of the Pagans remaining at first, and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire degenerating so generally into new Paganick Superstitions and Idolatries, it is no wonder these plagues of the six Trumpets should thus fall upon them. But there are two farther mistakes in the Remarker; The first is, that the Church about the commencement of the Trumpets was Symmetral, which is contrary to the <hi>Expositor</hi>'s Hypothesis; and when the Church became <hi>Asymmetral,</hi> the Christian Emperours who followed the guidance of the Church in the same measure, became <hi>Asymmetral</hi> also, and were the Head of the <hi>Beast, that was, is not, and yet is,</hi> in that measure it had degenerated into that form. The second is, that it is unreasonable that God should punish the Empire while it was in so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular a condition. For (to omit how the marked or sealed company were safe, and that there are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral passages in History testifying thereto) that which Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> has here noted is considerable. <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que sera,</hi> saith he, <hi>Christianorum Imperatorum ibi re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum potiuntium pietas justitiae Dei intercedere debuit non magìs quàm Pietas Iosiae ut regnum Iudae sangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis à Manasse effusi reum, excidium à Deo decretum effugeret.</hi> See 2 <hi>King.</hi> 2.16. And the making the <hi>Ostrogoth</hi> Kings one head of the Beast; how vain a conceit that is, I shall note in its proper place.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vers.</hi> 2. Christ is not called the <hi>East,</hi> but the <hi>Day-spring,</hi> &amp;c. And the naming him from a quarter of the Heavens, is an improper Appellation, though to name him from the <hi>light</hi> arising there, is proper. And the Angel's ascending from the <hi>East</hi> was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he came to seal those that were the Children of light, faithfully keeping the doctrine of the Sun of righteousness, and therefore did sutably to his office come from the Region of light.</p>

                        <hi>Ans.</hi> There wants no farther answer to this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, than what may be read in the Notes on this second verse. When Christ is called <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, which is here rendred the <hi>East,</hi> a <hi>quarter</hi> of the World is not understood, but the <hi>light</hi> arising in that <hi>quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vers.</hi> 9. The <hi>Palm-bearing</hi> Multitude are not the Victors over the Beast, but the Primitive Martyrs, who slain under the Altar, cryed for vengeance in the fifth Seat, and being there comforted with white Robes given them, and told that they should rest a little, whilst their brethrens sufferings were accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished; that time being expired, they in their white Robes come in Triumphant Acclamations, entering into the happy state here described, which is the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of their sufferings, as the <hi>first Resurrection</hi> is the Reward for the Sufferers under the Beast. But for the Victors over the Beast to be here signified, is improbable; both from the <hi>unseasonableness</hi> of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the sounding of the Trumpets, and the <hi>needles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of it. Because what is said here, if meant of those Victors, is more fully set forth after the sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Trumpets; Nor is there mention here of their <hi>advancement to Rule,</hi> or of <hi>judgment</hi> being executed upon their <hi>Adversaries,</hi> which are the chief burthen of those Songs and Acclamations after the seventh Trumpet. Also here they are said to be without fault before the Throne of God, and to serve him day and night <hi>in his Temple</hi>; whereas of the Victors over the Beast in the New <hi>Ierusalem</hi> state it's said, the <hi>Throne of God and the Lamb is in it,</hi> and <hi>I saw no Temple there.</hi> The cry here also of <hi>salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to our God,</hi> v. 10. does answer to that loud voice in Heaven, <hi>ch.</hi> 12.10. <hi>Now is come salvation and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:48067:34"/>
strength,</hi> &amp;c. Which seems to be uttered by an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical quire, but is a rejoicing at the same salvation wrought by the Devil's being cast out, as is intended by this cry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There's also <hi>no coherence</hi> or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion betwixt the <hi>sealed company</hi> and the <hi>Palm-bearers,</hi> to make the sense here given allowable. For the sealing is before the beginning of the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, and the other not till the end of them. And though the signification of the sealing may reach to the end of the Trumpets, yet the coherence of all Prophecies being <hi>primarily</hi> in the <hi>Cortex</hi> or Schemes and Symbols, and <hi>secondarily</hi> in the sense contained in them; there being no such coherence here in the former, neither can there be in the latter.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> The making the <hi>Palm-bearing</hi> multitude the Souls of the Primitive Martyrs, is a mere conceit, and quiet out of the Rode of Prophetical Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Apocalypse, which insisteth not upon the Description of the State of Souls in Heaven, but of the State of the Church on Earth. That short hint, touching the Souls of the Primitive Martyrs under the Altar, that they should rest, that is, expect a little while and their bloud would be revenged, and that in the mean time they were put in an happy condition, signified by their white Robes, is sufficient; what more can be expected to be said of them? But the description of the <hi>Palm-bearing</hi> company does not sute with separate Souls in Heaven, but with the Inhabitants of the New <hi>Ierusalem</hi> on Earth, as may appear to any unprejudiced Reader of the 15, 16 and 17 verses of this Chapter. The conceit is so extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant, that according to the Remarker, instead of having but two Resurrections, we shall have three. So that instead of <hi>Blessed and holy is he that has
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:48067:35"/>
part in the first Resurrection,</hi> it should be said, Blessed and holy is he that has part in the second Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if there was a Resurrection before it, answering to the first Resurrection of them that suffered under the Beast, as this passage in the Remark implies. And that the Victors over the Beast should be here intimated, is neither <hi>unseasonable,</hi> it being upon the Excursion of the time of the sealed, and forearmed against the plagues of the six Trumpets; Nor <hi>need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,</hi> it being the Artifice of the Apocalypse to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent the same time, and state of things, more and less perfectly or fully, and to supply in one Vision what was omitted in another. So that it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that this Vision notes onely their <hi>Peace, Holiness</hi> and <hi>Security</hi> from <hi>Persecution.</hi> Consider the Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitor's Explication of those verses. And for their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God day and night in his Temple, that is no other Temple than that in the New <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> of which it is said, <hi>The Lord God Almighty, and the Lamb is the Temple thereof.</hi> And certainly the Cry of Salvation may well be as loud among the Victors over the Beast upon the Rising of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses and the seventh Vial, as on the defeat of Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism in <hi>Constantine</hi>'s time. And as for the <hi>Sealing,</hi> though it be declared before the sounding of the Trumpets, yet the nature of the thing does necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily imply, that it is performed all along the successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church through the first six Trumpets. And lastly, the <hi>coherence</hi> of all Prophecy is prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily and radically in the <hi>things</hi> predicted. But the <hi>coherence</hi> of the <hi>Cortex</hi> is a slippery hold, it being framed and fitted very often merely for external or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament and embellishing. This is so obvious and frequent in the Apocalypse, that it is needless to name
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:48067:35"/>
any example. Wherefore this <hi>sealing</hi> and <hi>sealed ones</hi> reaching to the <hi>end</hi> of the sixth Trumpet, a mention of the Victors over the Beast, the Witnesses rising at the <hi>Exit</hi> of the sixth Trumpet, is seasonably and orderly placed, and with all imaginable dueness of coherence, which was the thing to be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated.</p>

I have noted already. And though one great Sea may signifie a comprehension of several distinct Kingdoms subject to tumultuate, or rather War one against another, as having no union under one Head<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet the several <hi>Heads</hi> of these Kingdoms cannot so properly be represented by <hi>one Sun,</hi> which naturally implies one Head over them all. Wherefore being that the <hi>Saracens</hi> over-run so many Kingdoms and Principalities, if this must be the darkning of them, it would then have been said that the smoak of the Abyss darkned the <hi>Stars.</hi> For when <hi>Multitudes of Kings</hi> and Princes are concerned together, that have no dependence one of another, they are then signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by <hi>Stars.</hi> Whence the Red Dragon is said to have pulled down so many <hi>Stars</hi> with his tail, that is, to have subjected so many Kings and Princes to the Roman Empire. Wherefore it is rashly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, That the <hi>Sun-shine</hi> of the <hi>Gospel</hi> of the <hi>Sun of righteousness</hi> is not meant by the Sun that is here said to be darkned, whenas the smoak of the pit must be <hi>Mahometism.</hi> And therefore in this pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage <hi>Religion</hi> most certainly is related to, and is the main concern of the whole Book of the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> and other things predicted merely in order to it, <hi>viz.</hi> to the right worship of God through Jesus Christ. And therefore that sense which is easie and natural, and tends that way, is most assuredly the true sense of any passage of these Prophecies.

                     <p>THE Ten-horned Beast did rise out of the <hi>Sea,</hi> and two-horned Beast out of the <hi>Earth</hi>; and our Saviour setting his right foot on the <hi>Sea,</hi> and his left foot on the <hi>Earth,</hi> does signifie here his coming down from Heaven, to put down all Autority and power under his feet, the Earthly Powers within his Kingdom being within the seventh Trumpet to be abolished, and all things to become new, by forming a new Heaven and a new Earth, or establishing the Kingdom of Heaven upon Earth; and so making the Kingdoms of the World become the Kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> This Remark is not much amiss, saving that it lears toward that foul conceit, that there will be no Monarchy nor Princes over their respective Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities and Kingdoms, where the Kingdom of Christ is set up, whenas the twenty four crowned Elders do most certainly denote the pure Apostolick Christianity of those many Kings and Princes that will be contained within the Kingdom of Christ in the <hi>Millennium:</hi> And setting one foot on the Sea, and another on the Earth, refers particularly to the vanquishing the <hi>ten-horned</hi> Beast that came out of the <hi>Sea,</hi> ch. 13. and the false Prophet or <hi>two-horned Beast</hi> that came out of the Earth, <hi>v.</hi> 11.

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:48067:37"/>
Angel, and therefore cannot be branched into the seven Thunders. For after his roaring and the seven Thunders uttering their voices thereon, and the other matters after declared, there is a Regress to begin a new Prophecy of the Contents of the <hi>opened Book,</hi> and to bring the same down to the seventh Trumpet also, that the affairs of the six Trumpets and the <hi>opened Book</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> during the time of the Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian and worldly Powers) being connected as syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chronizing the seventh Trumpet, might close both together. The seven Thunders therefore seem sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolically to signifie a preparation of the Christian party against the great day of God at the seventh Trumpet, as the three unclean spirits, like Frogs, are of the Antichristian party. That as the latter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stir themselves with miraculous deceits to excite the Princes of the Earth to battel, so the former signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies a miraculous power of spirit, that shall exert it self in many Christian Heroes, whereby they shall become exciters and conductors of the Christian par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the same; and hereunto shall also become <hi>Boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerges's</hi> thundring out such powerfull convictive te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies against the abominations of their Enemies, and such denunciations of God's judgments against them for the same, as were not meet before that time to be uttered, and therefore were to be sealed up, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Some such meaning seems to be signified in <hi>Micah, ch.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 5, 6.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> The more clearly to decide this point, let us consider that the Apocalypse consists of three Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies, The Prophecy of the <hi>seven Churches,</hi> The Prophecy of the <hi>sealed Book,</hi> and the Prophecy of the <hi>opened Book</hi>; And that as it less derogates from their perfection, to be conceived each of them to
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:48067:38"/>
reach from the beginning of the Church to the end of the World, <hi>viz.</hi> of the affairs of this Earth, so of the first of them I have proved the same, as also shown that the second commenceth from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Church, and that it reaches to the end of the world, is plain from hence. The whole time of the Book consists but of seven Seals, and some things of the book reach to the end of the world, therefore the seventh Seal must reach to the end of the world. And the seventh Seal being divided into seven Trumpets, the seventh Trumpet must reach to the end of the world. Wherefore it is plain that the Prophecy of the sealed Book reaches to the end of the world; And if this Reasoning will not serve, I will anon confirm it by the Oath of the Angel. But in the mean time let us farther note, that the sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of each of these seven Trumpets, and the <hi>Visum</hi> of each Trumpet do synchronize or are of equal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, begin and end together. As for example, The <hi>Visum</hi> of the sixth Trumpet, which contains the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>running of the <hi>Turks,</hi> and the general Impenitency of the Western Christian World for their Idolatry, <hi>&amp;c. c.</hi> 9.20. The sixth Trumpet, I say, is conceived to sound all the while this <hi>Visum</hi> continues. Now the seventh Trumpet belonging to the Prophecy of the <hi>sealed Book,</hi> it was (before we come to the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the <hi>opened Book</hi>) immediately to succeed the sixth, and to sound all the time its <hi>Visum</hi> is exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. But it is manifest the roaring of the Angel im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately succeeds the sounding of the sixth Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet; wherefore it is plain, that the roaring of the Angel is substituted in the place of the sounding of the seventh Trumpet; and that the roaring of the Angel, as well as the sounding of the seventh Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:48067:38"/>
reacheth to the end of the world. But the Text says, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, when he cryed or roared, (not <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, when he had cryed) seven Thunders uttered their voices. Wherefore this roaring of the Lyon of the Tribe of <hi>Iuda,</hi> which reaches from the sixth Trumpet to the end of the world, is divided into seven Thunders. But the seventh Trumpet reaches from the sixth to the end of the world, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the space of the seventh Trumpet is divided into seven Thunders. And how easie, natural, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed inevitable is this to one that is not blinded with prejudice. That in this Prophecy of the <hi>sealed Book,</hi> as the seventh Seal is divided into seven Trumpets, so the seventh Trumpet (which as the rest belongs to the Prophecy of the <hi>sealed Book</hi>) should be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into seven Thunders, those seven Thunders immediately following the sixth Trumpet, as the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Trumpets immediately follow the sixth Seal. Out of all which it is manifest, that the Prophecy of the <hi>sealed Book</hi> reacheth to the end of the world, as well as the Prophecy of the <hi>seven Churches.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now therefore to consider the Remark on this verse, it is manifest out of what has been said, that the seventh Trumpet does synchronize with the roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the mighty Angel, because his roaring is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted into the place of the sounding of the seventh Trumpet, which reacheth to the end of the world, and that <hi>roaring</hi> being branched into <hi>seven Thunders,</hi> that the <hi>seventh Trumpet</hi> is branched into <hi>seven Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi> Nor does the Regress to begin a new Prophecy of the Contents of the opened Book clash at all with this synchronizing of the seventh Trumpet, with the roaring of the Angel and the seven Thunders, but most naturally agree with it; this roaring and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:48067:39"/>
Thunders reaching to the end of the world (to the utmost term of the <hi>Laodicean</hi> succession, of the <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, as <hi>Ptolemy</hi> calls it, <hi>Laodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cea combusta, Laodicea</hi> burnt down by Thunder and Lightning from Heaven at the Conflagration, which congruity in all likelihood gave occasion of deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating these seven divisions of the last Trumpet from Thunders; and farther confirms, that these Thunders reach to the end of the world), and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the most fittingly intimates a Regress to a new Prophecy, namely, to that of the opened Book. Which, if we will not derogate from its perfection, must, as the two former, reach from the beginning of the Church to the end of the world. And as for the synchronizing of the affairs of the first six Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, with those of the opened Book, till the seventh, that it is a precarious surmise, will appear in its due place. But now it being so plain, that the seven Thunders synchronize with the seventh Trumpet, it is manifest that all that the Remarker delivers about the <hi>Frogs,</hi> and <hi>Hero's,</hi> and <hi>Boanerges's</hi> (the <hi>seven</hi> Thunders being a symbol of no such things, but of a distinction, as other <hi>sevens</hi> in the Apocalypse, of that last space of time into so many Intervals; and those things being before the seventh Trumpet, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his supposition,) it is manifest, I say, that all those conceits of the Remarker are onely an idle evanid Dream.</p>

Or if there be, how does this Typifie <hi>Political</hi> Orders and Laws more than in Husbandry, Mechanicks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that it signifying all things under the Sun done in any order or method as well as <hi>Political</hi> Laws and Government, when this <hi>Time</hi> here spoken of shall be no more, we may all put up our Pipes, Trades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Husbandmen, Students, in whatever Arts and Faculties, and fall asleep with our fingers in our mouths, unless a spirit waken us that will drive us to act without order or government, which yet can be no Apostolick Spirit, because the Apostle's Precept

                     <p>I will onely here note which I intimated above on <hi>v.</hi> 3. That this Oath of the mighty Angel, That there shall be time no more saving in the days of the voice of the seventh Angel, plainly imports that the sounding of the seventh Trumpet reaches to the end of the World, or of the Scene of affairs on this Earth, (whence I inferred that the <hi>Sealed-book-prophecy</hi> did so.) Which is an Article so contrary to the belief of Atheistical and sensual men, that it is no wonder that so strong an Asseveration is used to impress it on them. But this answers to his calling himself, the <hi>Amen,</hi> &amp;c. in his Epistle to the <hi>Laodicean</hi> Church, where the same Article is asserted. See the <hi>Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
                        <pb n="61" facs="tcp:48067:42"/>
it self on this present Chapter. This Angel therefore swearing at the Expiration of the sixth Trumpet, that there shall be no more time, saving in the days of the sound of the seventh Trumpet, and this before there is any entrance into the Prophecy of the <hi>opened Book,</hi> plainly joins the seventh Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet to the sixth, and so makes a decursion from the beginning of the <hi>Sealed-book-prophecy,</hi> to the very end of it, conterminating to the end of the world, and by mentioning the seven Thunders also before the said <hi>Sealed-book-prophecy</hi> is finished, points us plainly to a division of the sounding of the seventh Trumpet into seven such Intervals, as the seventh Seal was divided into, <hi>viz.</hi> seven Trumpets, as we noted above. And thus by the Oath of the Angel, as I observed before, by the bye, it is assuredly true that the Prophecy of the sealed Book reacheth to the end of the World.</p>

                     <p>IT's very incongruous that the Temple or <hi>Thysia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterion,</hi> and the Outward Court being one En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Fabrick, should signifie prophetically things suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding one another. But they here signifie indeed things that synchronize. For the <hi>Worshippers</hi> in the <hi>Temple,</hi> and at the <hi>Altar,</hi> are measured, to be preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from those evils which they in the outward Court do suffer by its being trodden down, and are the <hi>same</hi> with the <hi>two Witnesses</hi> in the next verse, the <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> or those that officiate in the ruling or <hi>judicial,</hi> and in the <hi>Priestly</hi> offices. The Worshippers in the <hi>Temple</hi> signifie the first, because there was the Law in the Ark, on which the Divine Presence was seated in the Mercy-seat, as on a Throne of Judgment, to be consulted with, and the Worshippers at the <hi>Altar</hi> do plainly enough signifie the latter.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> That things coexistent together, may signifie things succeeding in time one after another, may appear from that Analogy <hi>Space</hi> has to Time; and they partake so much in the common similitude of one nature, that <hi>Spatium</hi> signifies as well <hi>Spatium Temporis,</hi> as <hi>Spatium Loci,</hi> as is abundantly manifest in reading Latin Authours. And as in the Extension of <hi>Space</hi> or <hi>Place,</hi> one part is out of another, not confounded one with another, and upon some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect one part counted in <hi>site</hi> before another, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther after: So it is also in the succeeding parts of <hi>Time.</hi> And as the parts of <hi>Space</hi> are measurable or
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:48067:43"/>
numerable, so are the parts of <hi>Time:</hi> And there may be the same proportion betwixt a part of Space, to a part of Space; that there is betwixt a part of Time, to a part of Time, and <hi>alternatim.</hi> So that even from hence we may be satisfied, that the <hi>Area</hi> of the Inner and the Outer Court, without any Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity, may be made prophetically to signifie things succeeding one another. If the <hi>Inner</hi> Court have an aptitude to denote the Church in her <hi>purer</hi> condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the <hi>Outer</hi> in her <hi>less pure,</hi> as questionless they have, and she be first in that first condition, and after in the second; it's plain that the <hi>Inner</hi> and <hi>Outer</hi> Court, though they be coexistent, yet have an aptness to signifie things succeeding one another. And if the <hi>Area</hi> of the <hi>Inner</hi> Court bear the same proportion to the <hi>Area</hi> of the <hi>Outer,</hi> that the <hi>Time</hi> of the <hi>Purity</hi> of the Church to the <hi>Time</hi> of her <hi>lesser Purity,</hi> by easie Analogy the Proportion of the <hi>Outer Area</hi> to the <hi>Inner,</hi> will give us the proportion of the time of the <hi>less Purity</hi> of the Church to the time of her <hi>Purity.</hi> These things will be whether we will or no.</p>
                     <p>And these significancies are so congruous and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, that they are ordinarily hit upon. Thus <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius à lapide</hi> on <hi>Ezekiel</hi> says, <hi>Atrium gentium non mensuratum significat innumerabilem gentium multitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinem Ecclesiae adjungendam.</hi> And <hi>H. N.</hi> makes the <hi>Sanctum</hi> and the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum</hi> two Dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the one following the other, and favourably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprets the latter of the Dispensation of his own Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers. Also the three immured Intervals of Space in <hi>Cebes</hi> his <hi>Table,</hi> signifie three States or Moral con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of men succeeding one another in time. And the <hi>seven Churches</hi> in the Apocalypse, though coexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:48067:44"/>
together, yet the spirit of Prophecy makes use of them to signifie seven succeeding States of the Church Catholick and Apostolick. And the parts of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s Image he saw in his dream, though view'd altogether, represented notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing four successive Kingdoms, according to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Metals it consisted of. And lastly, <hi>Are<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas,</hi> even upon this place, by the <hi>Inner</hi> Court under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands the <hi>Iudaical</hi> Church, by the <hi>Outer</hi> the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian.</hi> Wherefore it is very congruous to understand, though they be States in succession, the <hi>Inner</hi> Court of the <hi>pure</hi> State of the Christian Church, and the <hi>Outer</hi> of her State Apostatical.</p>
                     <p>But to make the <hi>Inner</hi> and <hi>Outer</hi> Court to signifie things that do synchronize, spoils those elegant Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies of <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Place,</hi> which I noted above. For as the <hi>Outer</hi> Court's dimensions lye out from the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> so the <hi>Time</hi> that is signified by the one, should be distant from the Time that is signified by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and should by no means synchronize; which is as gross and harsh as to fansie the stones that pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the <hi>Inner</hi> and <hi>Outer</hi> Court laid confusedly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixtly one by another.</p>
                     <p>Besides, making the things signified here by the <hi>Inner</hi> and <hi>Outer</hi> Court to synchronize, makes the Prophecy of the <hi>opened Book</hi> to commence no higher than the beginning of the seventh or last Seal. Which is a strange mutilation, or if you will, decol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Prophecy of the <hi>opened Book,</hi> whenas the Prophecy of the seven Churches, and of the sealed Book, and it was a point of their perfection to doe so, commenced from the beginning of the Church. Wherefore this is a surmise very absurd. And the Absurdity still appears greater, in that the proper un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:48067:44"/>
of the <hi>Opened-book-prophecy</hi> is to set out the affairs of the Church, as the other of the <hi>sealed Book</hi> the affairs of the Empire. And yet thus it would omit the chiefest and most notable times there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Primitive</hi> Times, and the Victory of Christianity over Paganism. For if this present Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion begin so low as the seventh Seal, the next of the <hi>Woman cloathed with the Sun,</hi> must do so too, or else it would be a gross neglect of order and method, not to begin the Prophecy of the <hi>opened Book</hi> with a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion that had as high an <hi>Epocha</hi> of time as any. Which considerations may assure any intelligent Reader, that the Remarker is enormously out in making the things signified by the <hi>Inner</hi> and <hi>Outer</hi> Court to <hi>synchronize.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Such a monstrous mistake as this must needs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get a many frigid and dilute notions and interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: Such as these are that follow. The measu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the <hi>Inner</hi> Court signifies its preserving from the toils the <hi>Outer</hi> is oppressed with, which he offers as an argument that they synchronize. But the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and obvious sense, and onely sense of <hi>measuring</hi> a thing, is to try if it have its <hi>just</hi> dimensions, disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verable by the measure. <hi>Thou son of man, shew the house to the house of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their Iniquities, and let them measure the pattern.</hi> And suppose <hi>measuring</hi> signified <hi>preserving,</hi> yet it follows not that they of the <hi>Inner</hi> Court, and they of the <hi>Outer</hi> synchronize, but that such an Interval of the Church which answers to the <hi>Inner</hi> Court, shall be preserved from such Apostasies as that succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Church which answers to the <hi>Outer</hi> Court shall fall into.</p>

Now they prophesied 1260 days, so that the victory over them for which there's such joy, being after their prophesying, <hi>viz.</hi> for their being <hi>silenced,</hi> it must be <hi>after</hi> the 1260 days. Nor can they be supposed to prophesie the three days and an half they are said to <hi>lye dead,</hi> though they may when they are onely <hi>Politically</hi> slain, <hi>viz.</hi> kept out of power.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> The ordinary Translation is true, so far as it respects the sense of the <hi>Letter</hi> or <hi>Cortex</hi>; But [when they shall be a finishing their testimony] is also a true and natural sense, and indeed the onely sense consistent with the truth of the Prophecy, as I have clearly proved in the second part of my <hi>threefold Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendage.</hi> And for the <hi>silencing</hi> the Witnesses after they had prophesied 1260 days, that this must be their three days and an half <hi>lying dead</hi> is a marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous mistake. For how can they be <hi>silenced,</hi> but upon the penalty of their prophesying or witnessing? There is no other way of <hi>silencing</hi> them imaginable. And for God knows how many hundred years they were so severely <hi>silenced</hi> before, that banishment, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment, all manner of torturous Deaths were their penalty, for offering to speak against the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of the Apostatized Church. And lastly, they may <hi>prophesie</hi> as well when they are said to <hi>lye dead,</hi> as when <hi>politically slain.</hi> For to be Politically slain, is either at least to have no power or influence on affairs for the right guiding of them, or actually to be outed from any office in Church or State, which is to lye dead as to those points, but yet they may

prophesie at their own peril. <hi>Political</hi> Death is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed here onely to <hi>natural</hi> Death. And when they are <hi>silenced,</hi> i. e. put out of Autority, or licence to preach or prophesie, that is one kind of that <hi>Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Death that is opposed to <hi>Natural</hi>; but they thus lying not naturally dead, they may preach or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie as I said, at their own peril.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans. Heaven,</hi> in the prophetick style, is the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of <hi>Political Powers,</hi> and to interpret a Prophecy out of the road of the Prophetick style, is merely to trifle with a man's own private fancy.

Which seems to aim at some great Revolution, to the subverting of the Antichristian State of affairs in one of the ten Kingdoms the Empire was divided into, and so intro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ducing such a settlement as to be a prelude and pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern to what is to succeed in other Dominions.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> There is a <hi>very gross and false</hi> Principle laid down in this Remark, if I mistake not the Remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker's meaning.

That the Spirit of God will assist in making these Laws, and will actuate and invigorate both Rulers and People with a sensible and living relish of them to observe them, and see them observed in those excellent times that are to come, I willingly grant.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> What a marvellous Remark is this, that this verse is the beginning of the Prophecy of the <hi>opened Book!</hi> Whenas it is said <hi>ch.</hi> 10, 11. upon <hi>Iohn</hi>'s eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>opened Book; Thou must prophesie again before many Peoples, and Nations, and Tongues, and Kings.</hi> The Vision of the <hi>Inner</hi> and the <hi>Outer</hi> Court, the <hi>two Witnesses,</hi> their <hi>slaughter</hi> and <hi>resurrection,</hi> is it no Prophecy? What an affected blindness is this, not
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:48067:49"/>
to see so plain a Truth? Wherefore that Vision most certainly begins the Prophecy of the opened Book, which <hi>Iohn</hi> is said to swallow, and thereupon that he was to prophesie before many peoples, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which words this Vision immediately follows. And again, what a violence is this to make the <hi>opening of the Temple of God in Heaven</hi> no part of this first Vision, but to tear it off from the rest of the Vision, and make it part of the following, contrary to the auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the best Copies, and most approved Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the <hi>Apocalypse?</hi> There must be a strange pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice that should hurry any one upon such an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, it being also repugnant to what is said in the same verse, which he thus unnaturally breaks off<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <hi>And there were lightnings, and voices, and thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and an Earthquake and great Hail,</hi> which is plainly a description of matters concerning the <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Vial,</hi> where, <hi>ch.</hi> 16. it is said upon the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Vial being poured out into the Air, <hi>That there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings, and an Earth-quake, and a great Hail indeed,</hi> the Hailstones being of a talent weight. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of these five Phenomena, <hi>voices, thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derings, lightnings, Earthquake</hi> and a <hi>great Hail</hi> being found here, and no where else in all the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calypse, saving under the seventh Vial, what can it be but an Indication of their <hi>synchronizing</hi> or signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the same things? So that this cannot be the beginning of the ensuing Vision or Prophecy, but the conclusion of this comprized in this eleventh Chapter. And still it is more impossible, for as much as it is certain, that the Vision beginning in the next Chapter containeth the Persecutions of the Primitive Church, as we shall see anon, whence all in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:48067:50"/>
Chapter must necessarily belong to that first Vision. And therefore this Interpretation of the Temple of God being opened in Heaven, is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing extravagant. For this comes to pass after the seventh Angel begins to sound, which is a thousand and odd hundred years after the Christian Worship was received by the Emperours. We may note also, that the pretty Interpretation he makes of this pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage depends upon a <hi>Political</hi> sense of [Heaven] which he rejected before, and may better doe it now, it being not likely to signifie any thing more than merely the place where the Temple was seen; as [Heaven] is taken in the following Vision. (Where certainly it signifies not <hi>Symbolically,</hi> but <hi>Topically</hi> or <hi>Locally</hi>) <hi>viz.</hi> the Air from which Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion the Thunders and Lightenings were seen, as well as the Temple of God appeared there; As it is also said <hi>chap.</hi> 16. that upon the Angels pouring his Vial into the Air, there were thunderings and lightenings, which confirms to us, that [Heaven] here, which the Remarker would interpret <hi>Symbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lically,</hi> signifies onely <hi>Topically,</hi> and denotes the Air.</p>

                     <p>THe Woman <hi>cloathed with the Sun</hi> signifies the Church her being established in a Heavenly station by the Emperours receiving the Faith, (the supreme power being signified by the Sun) and so autorizing and defending the same by their auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and is not applicable to the <hi>Sun of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> farther than he is owned by the Emperours or worldly Powers to be <hi>Prince of the World,</hi> for she is beautified with this cloathing by her being in <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> But she was before her exaltation to that sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as much cloathed with the light of the Gospel, or the Sun of righteousness, and her Crown of <hi>twelve Stars</hi> does signifie as much as her being cloathed with the Sun in that sense.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> That the Expositor's interpretation of the Woman <hi>travailing in Birth and pained to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered</hi> is true, this alone may assure us, <hi>viz.</hi> because it is <hi>very natural</hi> and such as is hit upon by <hi>all</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters in a manner, I may add also necessary, it being incredible that the <hi>Opened-book-prophecy</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figuring the fate of the Church should omit the state of <hi>Persecution</hi> the <hi>Primitive</hi> Christians were under. Which if not here is no where figured out in the <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened-book-prophecy.</hi> Whence it is plain that as the Vision of the measured <hi>Inner Court</hi> prefigures the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and unapostatized state of the <hi>primitive</hi> Church, so this of the Woman in the <hi>throes of Childbirth,</hi> her sharp persecutions under the Pagan Emperours. But now for the Remarker's exposition, besides that
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:48067:51"/>
it is <hi>tautological,</hi> it presently repeating what was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, according to <hi>him,</hi> by the <hi>Temple opened in Heaven,</hi> that it is <hi>false</hi> appears, 1. Because it deprives the <hi>Opened-book-prophecy</hi> of any Vision that sets out the persecutions of the primitive Church, which is as notable and considerable as any thing that is prefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured in the whole <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> and so makes the <hi>Opened-book-prophecy</hi> defectuous. 2. It supposes, (which is false) that [Heaven] in this Vision sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies <hi>Symbolically</hi> when it signifies onely <hi>Topically.</hi>

                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> had signified <hi>Symbolically</hi> it would have run thus, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, i. e. <hi>And there appeared a great wonder, a Woman in Heaven cloathed with the Sun, &amp;c.</hi> if being <hi>seen in Heaven</hi> had signified her Political state or condition. Which it does no more than it does concerning the red Dragon, <hi>v.</hi> 3. who is not said to be seen in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, to set out his <hi>Political</hi> condition, for that his seven Crowns sufficiently shew, namely that he was in the highest <hi>Political</hi> state, but onely signifies <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pically,</hi> and declares in what place <hi>Iohn</hi> saw this won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull sight; and so it is of the Woman being seen there. 3. The Remarker's interpretation here and his exposition of [the Temple appearing in Heaven] contradicts the Text. For he supposes in both the Christian Religion to have become the Religion of the Emperours, and the Christian Laws the Laws of the Empire. Whence it is plain that the Woman cloathed with the Sun in his sense is <hi>past her Throes.</hi> This is point-blank against what is declared in the Vision, that the <hi>Woman cloathed with the Sun being with child, cried travelling in birth and pained to be delivered,</hi> whenas the <hi>being in Heaven</hi> in the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:48067:51"/>
Remarker's sense, implies she was <hi>delivered already.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Wherefore it being so plain from hence, that the 19th Verse of the precedent Chapter is not the <hi>begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> of <hi>this</hi> Vision, it is manifest that it <hi>ends</hi> the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and that the <hi>Earthquake</hi> and <hi>great hail</hi> is the same with that of the <hi>seventh Vial</hi>; And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently from what has been already noted here on this Chapter, and what deliver'd in my answers to the Remarks on the former, that the Vision compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in that Chapter commenceth with the beginning of the Church, and ends with the seventh Vial. It is also plain already, that the Vision begun in this 12th. Ch. commenceth from the beginning of the Church, and endeth not till the Vision of the Wine-press, which closeth the 14. Chapter, and which the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marker himself cannot deny but synchronizes with the seventh Vial. So that the 12.13. and 14. Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters contain one entire Vision (consisting of several parts) synchronal to the Vision contained in the 11. Ch. And the affairs represented in this 12. Ch. reach unto the Woman's flight into the Wilderness, where she is to be for a <hi>time and times and half a time,</hi> and to the emerging of the healed Beast out of the Sea, who makes war against her seed for 42 months, the same with a Time and Times and half a Time, and with the 1260 days of the mournfull Prophesying of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses. Which <hi>time</hi> and <hi>things</hi> answer to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, those of the 13. Chapter to those of the 11. as the <hi>time</hi> of the affairs of <hi>this</hi> 12. Chapter to the measured <hi>Inner Court</hi> there in Chap. 11. And now forasmuch as there is a War betwixt the <hi>Beast</hi> and the <hi>Soldiers of the Lamb</hi> in the 13. Chapter, the <hi>mustering</hi> of these Soldiers takes up part of the 14. Chapter, and the <hi>description</hi> of their <hi>condition,</hi> which
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:48067:52"/>
Soldiers therefore synchronize with the War menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in the 13. Chapter. And the voice of the first Angel is a menacing admonition to the <hi>Bestians</hi> for their Idolatry, threatning to them the ill success of their War against the Saints at <hi>last.</hi> Which commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natory voice of this first Angel commenceth for ought I can see with the fifth Trumpet, and extends it self to the Western as well as Eastern Empire, but is restrained to the time of the 42 months war. But the second Angel tells the <hi>actual</hi> success thereof, <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon is fallen, is fallen.</hi> Which answers to the <hi>fall of the City</hi> in the 11. Chapter, which is the <hi>success</hi> of the War there betwixt the <hi>Beast</hi> and the <hi>Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</hi> But what follows the <hi>Fall of the City,</hi> in the 11. Chapter, and the <hi>fall of Babylon</hi> in the 14. rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth into the times which commence with the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Trumper and end with the seventh Vial. So that there being such a perpetual correspondence of <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Things</hi> betwixt the Vision comprised in the 11. Chapter and this integral Vision contained in these three next, it is manifest they are two <hi>Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chronal</hi> Visions. And this I thought was a seasonable place to represent them to be such.</p>

                        <hi>Vers.</hi> 2. This <hi>travailing in pain</hi> is not the suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the <hi>Primitive</hi> Persecutions, but her labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to bring forth <hi>the Man-child that was to rule all Nations</hi>; that as she was exalted to that Heavenly station by the Emperours receiving the Faith, so the Devil might be cast down from the same, and so outed of his Dominion, which he held thereby, whereby the autority of Christ might be established in Heaven as <hi>Prince of the World.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> This travailing in pain must be understood of the Primitive Persecutions. For after the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:48067:52"/>
Religion had become the Religion of the Empire (which was upon the victories of <hi>Constantine,</hi> in whom the Man-child which the Woman brought forth <hi>who was to rule all Nations</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> those nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Nations contained in the Roman Empire) was caught up <hi>unto God</hi> and <hi>his Throne,</hi> that is, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested in the imperial Throne) the Woman, that is, the Apostolick Church was freed from her Throes. The Remarker seems to interpret without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to History. And here he harps again upon the same mistaken string, making Heaven signifie <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolically</hi> when it here onely signifies <hi>Topically.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vers.</hi> 7. The War here does not signifie the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict between the <hi>primitive</hi> Christians and their <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors</hi>: For the Christians were not then in such a station as to war in <hi>Heaven,</hi> but the War here on their side bears the same sense with the War of their Adversaries, <hi>viz.</hi> the Devil being sentenced to be cast out on the Man-child's being caught up unto God and his Throne, the War here was to put that sentence in execution, and it was betwixt the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Emperours</hi> and the <hi>Heathen Emperours,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the Tyrants who in favour of Paganism rose up against the Christian Emperours, by which War at length the power of the Devil or Pagan Empire was wholly abolished.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> The War does signifie the conflict betwixt the <hi>Primitive</hi> Christians and their <hi>Persecutors.</hi> And the reason alledged against it is very vain, as if [Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven] signified <hi>Symbolically</hi> and not <hi>Topically,</hi> which most certainly it does, as <hi>Grotius</hi> has also noted, and renders [<hi>in coelo</hi>] <hi>in aere.</hi> And when the Man-child was caught up unto God and his Throne, the Devil was not onely sentenced to be cast out but was
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:48067:53"/>
actually cast out. Nor was the Man-child taken unto the Throne of God, till the Christian Emperour had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome the Pagan.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vers.</hi> 11. Though the <hi>Primitive Christians</hi> did overcome their Accuser by the Bloud of the Lamb, so as to be exalted to the Heavenly station of ruling by the Man-child being caught up <hi>unto God and his Throne, &amp;c.</hi> and obtained sentence against their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary to be cast out, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet was that sentence executed as before by the War, <hi>v.</hi> 7.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> See what head-strong prejudice will doe! As if the Remarker shou'd say, though this eleventh verse does imply that the <hi>War</hi> was betwixt the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Christians</hi> and their <hi>Persecutors,</hi> yet it was not. But it does most certainly demonstrate that the War was betwixt the Primitive Christians and their Persecutors. For the words are these, <hi>For they overcame,</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> the red Dragon) <hi>by the bloud of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony, and they loved not their lives unto death.</hi> What can be a more express description of <hi>Martyrdom</hi> than this? This is not a description of a <hi>War</hi> of <hi>Emperours</hi> against <hi>Emperours</hi> with their armies in the field where they fight upon equal terms, but of <hi>Martyrs</hi> (with the word of their testimony) passively undergoing for their witnessing to the truth, what their cruel Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors would inflict upon them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vers.</hi> 12. <hi>The Dwellers in Heaven</hi> are bid to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice by reason of the <hi>salvation and strength and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God and power of his Christ,</hi> which was to come, and therefore surely must signifie them to whom the same came, whose particular concern this matter of joy was; whereas <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Martyrs</hi> are no farther concerned in it than in general, as they are concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:48067:53"/>
for the welfare of the Church; Nor can those that were exalted by preferments to the <hi>Political</hi> Heaven of the <hi>Empire</hi> be concerned in it farther than they were in such a state as to have the coming of <hi>salvation and strength and the Kingdom of God</hi> fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in them. For it onely respects those that are in such a state, who are called <hi>dwellers in Heaven</hi> in respect of the Heavenly station that they were exalted to thereby after the Devil and his Angels were cast out, and the autority of Christ established as <hi>Prince of the World.</hi> For then they became the joyfull com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with <hi>the Lamb on Mount Sion</hi> singing the <hi>Song of the victory, &amp;c.</hi> who as they are there <hi>markt on their foreheads</hi> for preservation, so they are the <hi>worshippers in the Temple and Altar</hi> (or the two Witnesses) <hi>meted for the same purpose,</hi> and are the same that are called <hi>dwellers in Heaven,</hi> Ch. 13.6. and are thus distinguished from those dwellers on Earth, against whom the woe is pronounced by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the power the Devil will have over them still after he is cast out.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> The Expositor has taken in both senses of [Heaven] <hi>political</hi> and <hi>natural,</hi> they being both sure and consistent one with another, and the joy of <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Martyrs</hi> at the welfare of the Church is too great to be slighted or omitted. But to ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble into <hi>mystical</hi> senses, and reach out to the <hi>company of the Lamb on Mount Sion,</hi> is not to interpret by rule, but to trifle. All <hi>Apostolick</hi> Christians were concerned in this victory of the Church, and most of those in <hi>high place</hi> in the Empire turned Christian. But the foregoing verse so plainly determining this joy to the victory of the Church in the times of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi> (which shews that the Kingdom of God
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:48067:54"/>
and power of his Christ was <hi>come already,</hi> and is said to be so, <hi>v.</hi> 10. <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not <hi>yet to come</hi>) it is a strange vagary to ramble from the <hi>Anteme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial</hi> synchronals to the <hi>middle</hi> synchronals, which undoubtedly the <hi>company</hi> on <hi>Mount Sion</hi> belong to. And for the Remarker's groundless conceit touching the <hi>worshippers in the Temple and Thysiasterion,</hi> the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity thereof has been above sufficiently shewn. And for the dwellers in Heaven, Ch. 13. v. 6. we shall consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it when we come at it. But for this present place, if the <hi>Dwellers in Heaven</hi> be those in <hi>high degree,</hi> the <hi>Dwellers on Earth</hi> must naturally signifie those in <hi>low degree,</hi> or common people, as the Expositor has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vers.</hi> 15. <hi>Arianism</hi> cannot be here intended more than the Catholick doctrine, they both running into extremes, and each maintaining their cause with like fumous Animosity. But by the Serpent's casting out water like a floud seems to be signified the frequent tumultuating of the common people and Magistrates that continued <hi>Pagans</hi> against the <hi>Christians,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by great outrages were oft committed. But such <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> and <hi>Catholicks</hi> may be also included who under a cloak of Religion did violently prosecute each other out of enmity or self-interest to the great reproach and ruine of Religion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> The contention betwixt the <hi>Arians</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks</hi> is most certainly included, and is that which History most of all rings of, and most highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned the Church, and therefore could not be omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in this <hi>Opened-book-prophecy</hi> which concerns the state of the Church: As for any other contests less no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table betwixt <hi>Christians</hi> and <hi>Pagans</hi> they were such as could not hazard the Woman's being <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:48067:54"/>
her being carried away with the sloud. None but a contention betwixt the Christians <hi>themselves</hi> and such as shaked the very <hi>foundation</hi> of their <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> could put her in that hazard. So that this is a very lank sense which the Remarker gives of this passage.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vers.</hi> 16. The <hi>Earth</hi> that helped the woman, by swallowing the sloud, may signifie the <hi>sober, stayd</hi> sort of <hi>people,</hi> who being either seasoned with prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Religion, or being of peaceable spirits, and obedient to authority, did endeavour to asswage all such tumults, and discountenance and oppose all such furious Animosities, and were for composing all dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences in a legal, orderly, and peaceable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> Undoubtedly that sloud of contention was the hot Contest betwixt the <hi>Arians</hi> and <hi>Catholicks.</hi> Could therefore the soberer sort of common people, <hi>Christians</hi> or <hi>Pagans,</hi> compose this difference? What an absurd conceit is this? The <hi>Earth</hi> that swallows up this sloud, does not signifie the <hi>common people</hi> here, though sometimes it is a Symbol of them. But the sense is onely this, That this floud of conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was swallowed down and dried up by the help of <hi>Oecumenical</hi> Councils, as some rapid Torrent is suck't down by the gaping of the Earth. This is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. But farther curiosity might invite a man to fanfie that <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>THE name of <hi>Blasphemy,</hi> if it does intend <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,</hi> yet it hath a farther signification, as, <hi>All sins and blasphemies shall be forgiven men, but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost,</hi> &amp;c. Where the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant reproach of God's Spirit evidencing it self in the works of our Saviour, is said to be unpardonable blasphemy; And the like reproaching of the holy Spirit manifesting it self in the Saints is likewise blasphemy, though not of so heinous a degree. Which kind of blasphemy seems here to be <hi>chiefly</hi> intended.

style being such as to signifie things <hi>Iconi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stically,</hi> rather than <hi>plainly.</hi> See, <hi>Blasphemy,</hi> in the Expositor's <hi>Alphabet of Iconisms.</hi> Moreover, this Vision sets out the state of the <hi>visible</hi> Church (which visible state of things in the Church is the main ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of those Visions of the Apocalypse that concern the Church, as this Prophecy of the <hi>opened Book</hi> does) wherefore the Vision in this 13<hi>th</hi> Chapter comprizing those times of the Church, wherein she was so visibly apostatized into <hi>Idolatry,</hi> some <hi>Iconi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical</hi> passages or other must particularly indicate that, nor the Vision be content with that more slight and unobservable intimation, by calling the two Beasts that appear here <gap reason="foreign">

And lastly, that it does not signifie <hi>Blasphemy</hi> in the Remarker's sense, <hi>viz.</hi> reproaching and speaking evil of the Saints, may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear from hence, because this Title of <hi>Blasphemy</hi> is set in common upon <hi>all the seven Heads,</hi> whenas se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of them as the <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Decemviri</hi> had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to doe with the Saints or any of the Church of God. Nay, six of these Heads were gone before the Saints, which the Remarker means, were on the Stage, and so had no occasion to blaspheme them. But that they are <hi>all</hi> seven <hi>Idolatrous</hi> Heads, is unquestionable with those that understand sense. Wherefore <hi>Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy,</hi> and <hi>to blaspheme,</hi> in several other places of
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:48067:56"/>
Scripture, signifying <hi>Idolatry,</hi> as well as here, as is abundantly made out by Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> and <hi>Peganius</hi> upon the place, (see also the <hi>Alphabet of Iconisms,</hi>) it seems to me an homoursome business in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marker, that he should balk the Exposition of that excellent Interpreter Mr. <hi>Mede,</hi> and take up with one so little approvable with any, unless with some conceited <hi>touchy souls,</hi> that fansie themselves Saints before they be so, and love separation, and cry out, <hi>Stand off, I am more holy than thou</hi>; that when they are sharply, though justly, reproved for their real Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie, factiousness and other vices and miscarria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, they may imagine themselves to be <hi>blasphemed</hi> by the <hi>Beast</hi> or his Worshippers, and so be the more confirmed in their <hi>presumed Saintship,</hi> and in all the enormities that attend such a delusion. So little edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying is such a precarious Exposition as this. There wanted no prophetical Monitions or Prefigurations that wicked men will speak ill of good men from that Antipathy which is betwixt them. But that the <hi>pretended</hi> Church of Christ <hi>still professing Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> and declaring <hi>against Idols,</hi> should really be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>Idolatrous,</hi> and establish <hi>Idolatries</hi> by a Law, to be able to predict <hi>this,</hi> was becoming the Presci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of God, and to predict it, his Goodness, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so usefull for the Reformation of the Church. There is nothing more that is material in this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, unless I should take notice of that Assertion which seems to insinuate, that mens speaking evil of the fruits of God's Spirit appearing in good men, though of a private and ordinary quality, not special Missionaries from God, as Christ and his Apostles were, nor publick persons or Grandees in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that reproaching such is termed <hi>Blasphemy</hi> in
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:48067:56"/>
Scripture. Which I dare say is false; let him search all the English Bible, and find a place if he can. And if so; then this Interpretation of the Remarker is quite out of doors.</p>

                        <hi>Ans.</hi> The deadly wound of one of the Heads of the Beast is the <hi>Conversion</hi> of the Emperour, the <hi>sixth Head,</hi> to <hi>Christianity,</hi> which was the issue of the War betwixt <hi>Michael</hi> and the <hi>Dragon,</hi> the War betwixt the <hi>Primitive Christians</hi> and their <hi>Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours,</hi> ch. 12. as has been there proved against the Remarker.

It was by their faith in the <hi>Word,</hi> which is the <hi>sword of the spirit,</hi> that the <hi>Primitive Christians</hi> overcame their <hi>Persecutours.</hi> This mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is very easie and natural. But that the Remarker would distort this passage to the Incursion of the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Nations, and the extinguishing of the Western
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:48067:57"/>
Emperours in <hi>Augustulus,</hi> shews him less mindfull of that indispensable Rule in the Interpreting the Visions of the <hi>Opened-book-prophecies</hi> especially (which set out the affairs of the Church) <hi>That that Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is to be preferred that points at the state of the Church and matters of Religion.</hi> This is a most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Truth. And to shew how unsuccessfull he is by balking it, it is said <hi>v.</hi> 3. that <hi>the Head that was wounded was healed.</hi> So that this Vision represents the Ten-horned Beast (whose <hi>ten</hi> horns were <hi>crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> and <hi>wounded</hi> Head <hi>healed</hi> at the same time) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his healed condition, though the perfection of his cure extended farther. But in the <hi>Political</hi> sense this Western Head was not healed till <hi>Corolus Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> his time.

The first such as are but in a <hi>Legal</hi> state under a <hi>Christian</hi> profession, and therefore are peculiarly characterized by bearing the <hi>Name of God,</hi> because the loving and professing the same is the height of such a state. Therefore <hi>Esay.</hi> 63.19. makes it the distinguishing character of the Jews from other Nations, that they were <hi>called by God's Name,</hi> and on their revolt from their obedience, <hi>Ier.</hi> 44.26. they are threatned, <hi>that God's Name shall be no more named by any of them.</hi> And our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's

first Petition in his prayer seems to respect this state as preparatory to that which he teacheth next to pray for. The second, such as by <hi>faith</hi> have attained to an <hi>entrance into life or communion with God by his Spirit,</hi> but not thereby to such a full sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to him, or victory over the World, whereby to live in a constant communion with him, but his abode in them is as the <hi>sojourning in a Tabernacle</hi>; and this state of Christians does answer to the <hi>outward Court,</hi> which was left out and not <hi>meted</hi> to be <hi>preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi> from profanation, <hi>&amp;c. Rev.</hi> 11.1, 2. Whence at the descent of the new <hi>Ierusalem</hi> (which is at the Restauration of the outward Court) it's said, <hi>The Tabernacle of God is with men.</hi> The third, such as answer to the <hi>Worshippers in the Temple,</hi> and at the <hi>Altar,</hi> and are <hi>measured</hi> for <hi>preservation,</hi> when the <hi>outward</hi> Court is left out to be profaned and troden down during the Antichristian Apostasie. These overcome the Beast, and are those Inhabitants of <hi>Mount Sion,</hi> that were <hi>redeemed from the Earth, and follow the Lamb whereever he goes, being without fault before the Throne of God,</hi> &amp;c. In whom God is not a <hi>sojourner</hi> as in a <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> but makes his constant abode in them (by that communion with him in life which they enjoy) as in a <hi>Temple,</hi> and who though, as being the <hi>two Witnesses,</hi> they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed in a mournfull condition by reason of their being sorrowfully affected with the evils of the World they testifie against, yet they are <hi>joyfull Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers on Mount Sion,</hi> ch. 14. to whom that voice is directed, <hi>ch.</hi> 12.12. <hi>Rejoyce ye Heavens, and ye that dwell in them.</hi> But to make the <hi>Idolatrous</hi> worship of God, or of Saints and Angels (supposed here for the dwellers in Heaven) to be signified by the <hi>blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming</hi>
                        <pb n="93" facs="tcp:48067:58"/>
of him and them, is a forced construction, being what is done is out of a real design of paying due worship and honour to them. Though it be er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous and corrupt, yet can it badly be called a blaspheming of them (which imports rather a <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant</hi> purpose to reproach them than to honour them) especially in reference to <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Angels,</hi> who have by such worship <hi>more</hi> ascribed to them than is <hi>due,</hi> though it may be in reference to <hi>God,</hi> who hath thereby <hi>less</hi> ascribed to him than his due, and so is dishonoured.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> That there are two states of men in refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Religion, I allow, a <hi>legal</hi> or exteriour state, (when out of fear of Hell and hope of Heaven they live as near as they can according to an external Rule) and a <hi>spiritual</hi> state, which is the state of <hi>Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and of the <hi>spirit of life in the new Birth,</hi> which may be less or more perfect, whereby they have a <hi>sense</hi> of the <hi>sweetness</hi> and <hi>loveliness</hi> of the <hi>Divine life,</hi> and are held thereby in communion with God. And I allow also that this state may be either <hi>vinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> or <hi>invincible.</hi> So that the Remarker may ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine three estates if he will, but by the like subdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision of the <hi>legal</hi> state there may be four. For there may be such a <hi>strong fear</hi> of Hell in an unregenerate man, that it may make him also invincibly resist all such Injunctions as are put upon him, which seem repugnant to the word of God, for fear of being damned and tormented in Hell. So precarious is this conceit of just <hi>three</hi> states. But grant <hi>just</hi> three states, I deny that the men under these three states are signified by the <hi>Name of God,</hi> by the <hi>Tabernacle of God,</hi> and by the <hi>dwellers in Heaven.</hi> First, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause men merely under such dispensations, who yet
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:48067:59"/>
are neither extraordinarily <hi>inspired Missionaries</hi> as Christ and his Apostles, nor publick <hi>Magistrates,</hi> which the Scripture calls <hi>Gods,</hi> and the like, are not capable of being <hi>blasphemed,</hi> that is, the <hi>phrase</hi> is not <hi>proper</hi> for them, and therefore it is a sign they are not here understood. Again, the Remarker cannot produce any places of Scripture where the <hi>Name of God</hi> signifies Men in a <hi>legal</hi> state, or the <hi>Tabernacle of God</hi> signifies men in a <hi>less perfect spiritual</hi> state, or that the <hi>Dwellers in Heaven</hi> denote men <hi>precisely</hi> in an <hi>invincible spiritual</hi> state. As for the Scriptures cited for the first. <hi>God's name</hi> was not the people of <hi>Israel themselves</hi>; and when we pray, Hallowed be <hi>God's name,</hi> do we understand the <hi>people of God</hi> there by <hi>God's name?</hi> What trifling is this? And lastly, besides all this, if by <hi>God's name</hi> is meant those that <hi>bear his Name</hi>; this, according to the style of the Apocalypse, signifies the highest attainment in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, as being the character of the <hi>Philadelphian state,</hi> ch. 3.12. <hi>I will write upon him the Name of my God.</hi> And so the <hi>Tabernacle of God,</hi> it cannot be the Note of the <hi>less perfect</hi> degree of the <hi>spiritual</hi> state, because it is the <hi>Ierusalem</hi>-state, the highest degree of the <hi>spiritual</hi> state, that is, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 21.3. and the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion there described is a <hi>permanent</hi> condition; so that this conceit of <hi>sojourning</hi> is a perfect mistake: Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which, the Restauration of the <hi>outward Court</hi> would be a restoring of it to a <hi>sojourning con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</hi> How repugnant are these things? Nor is there any thing brought to prove, that the <hi>dwellers in Heaven</hi> signifie men of the third state, but that of <hi>ch.</hi> 12.12. <hi>Rejoyce ye Heavens, and they that dwell in them.</hi> Which we have proved to belong to the Times of <hi>Constantine.</hi> And as for the conceit touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:48067:59"/>
the <hi>Worshippers in the Temple,</hi> and <hi>Thysiasterion,</hi> the groundlesness thereof was shew'd in my Answer to the Remarks on <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. So that this whole Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark hitherto is a strange incoherent dream of forced and far-fetched fancies.</p>
                     <p>And for his impugning the Expositor's Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is as weak as the other was wild. For suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the <hi>Idolatrous</hi> worship of God, Saints and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels to be well meant by them, that so worship them, (though the gain of the Church more than the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of them that they so worship, is in all likelihood aimed at by them that give the example to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) yet it does not follow but that this worship is really a reproach to them. Which Reproach, they being all made Objects of <hi>Religious</hi> worship, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly called <hi>Blasphemy,</hi> as <hi>Act.</hi> 19.37. the Town-Clark clears the Apostles from being <hi>blasphemers</hi> of the Goddess <hi>Diana.</hi> That they are all reproached, both God, Saints and Angels is made good in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position; and it is farther fitting that this reproach should be called <hi>Blasphemy,</hi> that by this sharp reproof they may be the more effectually staved off from committing <hi>Idolatry</hi> in such worship of God, Saints, and the holy Angels. To all which you may add, that it is usual in Scripture to charge the sinner with that <hi>directly</hi> which he commits but <hi>interpretativè,</hi> as <hi>Ier.</hi> ch. 2.27. the Prophet there makes the Jews to <hi>say to a stock, Thou art my father; and to a stone, Thou hast begotten me,</hi> for their praying to stocks and stones. See <hi>Synops. Prophetic.</hi> Book 1. Chap. 1.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vers.</hi> 10. This Scripture is of like sense with, Reward her as she has rewarded you, <hi>&amp;c. chap.</hi> 18. but the sense here given is to make a mercy and blessing to be threatned instead of a judgment, and
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:48067:60"/>
the Scripture to speak so ambiguously as to be unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> This is a comfortable promise to them that suffer for the present, that their cause shall obtain at last, and a threatening to the unconverted part of their enemies, that they shall lose so much of their dominion by those that are converted; and this cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly was to come to pass, and did come to pass a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Papal Power</hi> in the <hi>Rising of the Witnesses,</hi> the late blessed <hi>Reformation,</hi> which was more consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable than the killing by the Sword in a <hi>literal</hi> sense, which was no farther to come to pass than themselves necessitated it. This verse therefore sets out the <hi>expectant</hi> state of the <hi>Soldiers of the Lamb,</hi> the firm hope of victory at last for their sufferings, as is expresly said in those last words. <hi>Here is the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and faith of the Saints.</hi> But the news of their <hi>actual</hi> victory is by the second Angel, <hi>ch.</hi> 14.8.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vers.</hi> 12. The exercising <hi>all the power of the first Beast,</hi> &amp;c. does signifie the <hi>temporal</hi> dominion of the <hi>two-horned</hi> Beast, by plucking up three Horns by the roots; and for the better countenancing the power he did exercise, he as a Prophet, or Christ's Vicar, did confirm the exercise of the same power by the Beast, and so caused all to worship him. But his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercising all the power of the first Beast cannot signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his <hi>making Laws in matters of Religion</hi>; for if the first Beast had such power (which is not to be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) yet that cannot be called <hi>all</hi> his power, nor the <hi>greatest part</hi> of it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> One would think the Remarker a man of a mighty <hi>secular</hi> and <hi>worldly</hi> Genius, when notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing this <hi>Opened-book-prophecy</hi> related to the state of Religion in the Church, he ever distorts things to
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:48067:60"/>
a <hi>Politick</hi> or <hi>Civil</hi> sense, which yet are most natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally understood of Religion. For the words here run thus; <hi>And he exerciseth all the power of the first Beast before him, and he causeth the Earth, and them that dwell therein, to worship the first Beast, whose deadly wound was healed.</hi> Before which immediately precedes, <hi>And he spake as the Dragon,</hi> viz. decreed <hi>Idolatries</hi>
                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the reason then follows, because he had got the autority of the first Beast into his own hands, whereby he reduced the world again to a Draconick Religion, <hi>bloudy</hi> and <hi>Idolatrous.</hi> He had got <hi>all</hi> this <hi>kind</hi> of power into his hands, the <hi>two-horned</hi> Beast, I say, had so, but he had not got <hi>all</hi> the <hi>secular</hi> power of the Empire into his hands, no not by plucking the <hi>three Horns up by the roots.</hi> For the <hi>ten-horned</hi> Beast signifies the whole <hi>secular</hi> Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Empire. Besides, that the <hi>two-horned</hi> Beast began to renew the Image of the Dragon before he had <hi>plucked up the three Horns by the Roots.</hi> So that that passage [<hi>all</hi> the power of the first Beast] must be understood of that <hi>kind</hi> of power, it being false of the other. And this power of approving and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing matters of Religion in the supreme secular Magistrate, as it is declared in our Church, is most certainly their right; but this is not a place to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute the point. Thus safe is it to stear the sense of the <hi>Opened-book-prophecy,</hi> by having an eye to the affairs of <hi>Religion</hi> in the Empire.</p>

The <hi>change</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> by the victory of the <hi>Martyrs</hi> cannot be called a <hi>deadly wounding of the Beast by a sword,</hi> nor was there any ruine to it thereby; for the same <hi>Politick</hi> Body of the Beast continued till it was <hi>wounded to Death by a sword,</hi> viz. ruined by the <hi>Incursion of the Barbarous Nations.</hi>
                        <pb n="98" facs="tcp:48067:61"/>
And as he was not ruined by the <hi>ruine</hi> of the <hi>Pagan</hi> Religion, so the <hi>restoring</hi> of the like Religion was not the reviving of him. But he lived again when the like <hi>Politick</hi> body or Civil state of affairs in the Empire was re-established by the <hi>Ten-horned</hi> Beast, by the barbarous Nations settling into a subjection to, or a compliance with the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws. And as the Beast was revived when the former Politick state of the Empire was restored in the <hi>Ten-horned</hi> Beast, so when the Pope created a new succession of Emperours, it then became a <hi>complete Image</hi> of the former Beast. So that the <hi>Beast</hi> and his <hi>Image</hi> are not so denominated from the affairs of <hi>Religion,</hi> but from the <hi>Civil</hi> state of the Empire, yet so as to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude Religion as it is complicated with the civil affairs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> Here the Remarker again misseth the mark quite, by not taking heed to that inviolable Rule in expounding the <hi>Opened-book-prophecy,</hi> viz. <hi>that it sets out the state of the Empire in reference to matters of Religion, and the pure worship of God and Christ, and that these Expositions are the surest that respect that.</hi> For what cares the Spirit of Prophecy for taking notice of the changes of secular States and Kingdoms, but so far as God's true Church and the Purity of his Worship are concerned, and consequently those that worship him according to the Laws he has appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? The Pagan Emperours of <hi>Rome</hi> were <hi>Pontifices Maximi,</hi> as well as Emperours, and the <hi>Pagan Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> part of the Laws of the Empire, it being enac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and ratified by the Supreme Powers thereof, as the civil Laws were. Wherefore the <hi>Pagan Religion</hi> equally, if not more, being the very <hi>life</hi> and <hi>soul</hi> of the <hi>seven-headed red Dragon</hi> (that is, of the Pagan
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:48067:61"/>
Empire, which would <hi>cease</hi> to be the <hi>red Dragon,</hi> if the <hi>Pagan</hi> Religion ceased) than the <hi>Civil Laws</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, when the <hi>Pagan</hi> Religion was in a sort abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished by the <hi>sixth head</hi> of the <hi>red Dragon</hi> his turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Christian, namely the Emperour <hi>Constantine,</hi> &amp;c. Certainly that was the <hi>Head</hi> (and then) that was <hi>wounded to death,</hi> and wounded to death in the <hi>fullest</hi> sense that the <hi>Opened-book-prophecy</hi> can be truly thought to take notice of, as chiefly to aim at. For what is the Church concerned in the affairs of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, but so far as they either hinder or further the pure worship of God and Christ? And in the same sense that the <hi>Head</hi> was wounded to death, is the <hi>Beast</hi> said to be <hi>wounded</hi> (in this verse) <hi>by the sword,</hi> namely in the <hi>red Dragon's</hi> fight with <hi>Michael</hi> and the <hi>Martyrs,</hi> the battel being described in the <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately</hi> foregoing Chapter; and therefore where should he get his wound but there? For the Martyrs sticking close to the <hi>truth</hi> of the <hi>word,</hi> which is the <hi>sword</hi> of the spirit, got the victory over the Beast, they <hi>loving not their lives unto the Death.</hi> Add un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all this, that the Beast could not revive before his head wounded to death was cured. <hi>Neque enim sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natio istaec factum aliquod posterius fuit, sed ipsa Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitas Bestiae novissimae,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> judiciously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes from the genuine sense of the Text of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy. But in this <hi>civil</hi> or <hi>secular</hi> sense that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marker drives at, his head was not cured till <hi>Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus Magnus</hi> was made the Western Emperour. But he is represented in this Vision in the beginning of it as with <hi>ten crowned</hi> Horns, so with his <hi>head cured.</hi> Such he was when he emerged out of the Sea, he was revived again from his deadly wound. Therefore the <hi>Epocha</hi> of this Vision, as I noted before, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menceth
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:48067:62"/>
as low as the reign of <hi>Carolus Magnus,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Remarker, and the 42 Months of the Beast must end after two thousand years after Christ. And besides this, according to the Remarker's sense of the <hi>reviving</hi> of the Beast, and Beast's <hi>Head</hi> will continue <hi>dead</hi> near three hundred years after the body of the Beast was <hi>revived.</hi> This it is to attempt to unlock the Apocalypse without that excellent Key, the Rule I have so often mentioned.</p>

                     <p>IF the zeal of those <hi>Greek</hi> Emperours named were not a sufficient fulfilling of the monition of the <hi>first Angel,</hi> the overrunning of the Empire by the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racens</hi> would be far more proper to make it up, both in regard of time and other respects, than the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing by the <hi>Turks.</hi> But neither of them are signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, being Visions belonging to the <hi>sealed Book.</hi> Nor needs there any farther fulfilling than what was by those <hi>Greek</hi> Emperours.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> The Expositor's words on this verse are these; <hi>That this Angelical Monition was the most loudly and earnestly urged upon the Christian World, at the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full siege and storming of Constantinople, and subduing the whole Eastern Church and Empire to the Turk.</hi> Which makes neither the plague of the <hi>Saracens</hi> nor <hi>Turks</hi> to belong to the <hi>Opened-book-prophecy,</hi> but lets them keep their place in the Prophecy of the <hi>sealed Book.</hi> But implies onely, that the voice of that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:48067:62"/>
is not confined to the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperours onely, but may be stretched to as many, either <hi>secular</hi> Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates or <hi>Prelates,</hi> or other <hi>eminently zealous</hi> men, and observant of the severe judgment of God against the Idolatrous Greek Church. For ought I know, those early <hi>Evangelici</hi> may come in for a share here, who were Preachers of the everlasting Gospel, that which was purely contained in Scripture, and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red against the <hi>Idolatries</hi> and <hi>Superstitions</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and sealed their Testimony with their bloud, I mean the <hi>Waldenses</hi> and <hi>Albigenses.</hi> Who if they made any use of the judgments of God by the <hi>Saracens</hi> on the Empire, as well as others might do of his judgments by the <hi>Turks,</hi> and it can be made out, I am not against it. And from the end of the <hi>Albigensian</hi> War, which was finished <hi>Anno</hi> 1242, to the taking of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> which was in the year 1453, in that Interval there were many famous men declaring for the everlasting Gospel against the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian doctrines and practices, and they making the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> the Antichrist, could not but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce this approaching judgment. You may see their names in <hi>Alstedius</hi> and <hi>David Pareus.</hi> And up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the taking of <hi>Constantinople</hi> by the <hi>Turk,</hi> the voice of this first Angel would be louder in preaching the everlasting Gospel, and denouncing the fall of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ</hi> or <hi>Babylon</hi> till the second Angel could tell the news that it was done. See <hi>Alstedius</hi> his <hi>Chronologia testium veritatis,</hi> where you may easily make Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections to this purpose.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vers.</hi> 8. The fall of <hi>Babylon,</hi> viz. the commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, is most aptly applied to the separation of the <hi>Albigenses</hi> and <hi>Waldenses</hi> from the communion of it; to which may be added the separation of the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:48067:63"/>
                        <hi>Greek</hi> Church from it, before the subduing of the Empire by the <hi>Turks.</hi> But to apply this to the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,</hi> will clash with the admonition of the third Angel.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> The <hi>Waldenses</hi> and <hi>Albigenses</hi> could not be the Angel that declared that <hi>Babylon</hi> was <hi>fallen,</hi> but were a people that were aggrieved that it <hi>stood,</hi> but were an holy good people, and truly Evangelical, and preachers of the <hi>Everlasting Gospel,</hi> and denouncers of the judgments of God against <hi>Babylon,</hi> predicting that it would fall, and therefore belong to the <hi>first Angel.</hi> And though Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> would draw the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the <hi>Waldenses</hi> and <hi>Albigenses</hi> to the voice of the <hi>second Angel,</hi> yet he has not the confidence to say that their appearing was the <hi>fall</hi> of <hi>Babylon,</hi> but onely, that, as he phrases it, <hi>Iam nunc ruinae Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis jaciuntur fundamenta.</hi> And he would counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance his application from the very place that, [<hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi> is fallen is fallen] alludes to, <hi>Isa.</hi> ch. 21. Because at the time that <hi>Isaias</hi> uttered that Prophecy, the <hi>Medes</hi> cast off the yoke of the <hi>Assyrians,</hi> and build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their imperial City <hi>Ecbatana</hi> under their new King <hi>Dejoces,</hi> laid the foundation of an Empire fatal to <hi>Babylon,</hi> as well as to <hi>Nineve.</hi> But supposing that so, yet it is plain in the Vision that the Prophet <hi>Esay</hi>'s Imagination was not carried to the time of <hi>Dejoces</hi> and the building of <hi>Ecbatana,</hi> but to that very <hi>festival</hi> night that <hi>Belsazer</hi> celebrated, in which the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians</hi> took <hi>Babylon.</hi> And it might very well then be said, <hi>Babylon is fallen, is fallen.</hi> But the other time being about 150 years before, if it had been said that then <hi>Babylon</hi> was fallen, it had been a falshood, and so it is in the News of the second Angel, if the Angel respect the Times of the <hi>Albi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genses</hi>
                        <pb n="103" facs="tcp:48067:63"/>
and <hi>Waldenses,</hi> and say that then <hi>Babylon</hi> was fallen, it is plainly an untruth, it standing tight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 400 years after their appearing. Nor can his so pronouncing be excused by this passage in <hi>Esay,</hi> as has been plainly proved. See <hi>Munster, Vatablus</hi> and <hi>Cornelius à lapide</hi> upon that Vision of <hi>Esaias.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But now, how the separation of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church has any place here, I understand not. But if the breaking of that short union, such as it was, of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church with the <hi>Roman</hi> be reckoned to this partial fall of <hi>Babylon,</hi> how much more is the <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi> begun by <hi>Luther</hi> (which is nearer to that <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair</hi> of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, than that to the <hi>Albigensian</hi>) to be reckoned thereto, when so many Countries, Principalities and Kingdoms fell off from the Papacy? Wherefore this voice of the second Angel is most fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly applied to the <hi>Reformation,</hi> as the Rising also of the Witnesses, the <hi>Rising</hi> of the Witnesses being the fall of <hi>Babylon.</hi> And it is said expresly, at the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the Witnesses, that a <hi>tenth part</hi> of the City <hi>fell,</hi> viz. of the City <hi>Babylon.</hi> Which being not a final or total Ruine of <hi>Babylon,</hi> but, as it were, the <hi>Primity</hi> thereof, and at least a tenth part thereof fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the <hi>Reformation,</hi> it is a most evident argument that the <hi>Reformation</hi> is the Rising of the Witnesses, and <hi>this very fall of Babylon,</hi> which is with that Joy and Triumph declared by this <hi>second Angel.</hi> What can be more clear? And therefore this joyfull An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation of the fall of <hi>Babylon</hi> corresponds with the Doxology of the Elders upon the sounding of the seventh Trumpet, <hi>ch.</hi> 11. Nor does this at all clash with the Admonition of the third Angel, as we shall presently see.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="104" facs="tcp:48067:64"/>
                        <hi>Vers.</hi> 11. The misapplying the Monitions of the <hi>two former Angels</hi> hath run the <hi>third</hi> out of distance, to signifie the Condemnation to Hell-Torments, which is peculiar to the day of judgment, whenas plainly here is signified a judgment in this life. For their torments are said to be in <hi>the presence of the holy Angels,</hi> and by reason of the suffering them <hi>the Worshippers of the Beast have no rest day nor night</hi>; And it's also said, <hi>Here is the patience of the Saints, viz.</hi> in bearing what they shall suffer from the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippers of the Beast enraged with these Torments. So that doubtless this Monition of the Angel does sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the plagues of the Vials.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> The Monition of the third Angel is not run out of due distance, nor reaches to the last judgment, when the wicked shall be cast into Hell, but is onely a peremptory declaration, that those that worship the Beast and his Image shall be so served at the last day, at the general day of judgment. But this does not excuse them from unquietness and unpeaceable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of mind in this life. And that that final Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is to be inflicted in the presence of the holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and in the presence of the Lamb is no argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that it is a judgment in this life, because the <hi>Holy Angels,</hi> as also the <hi>Saints</hi> (<hi>Martyrs</hi> especially) will be <hi>Assistents</hi> to the <hi>Lamb</hi> on his <hi>Tribunal</hi> at the last day, when he shall pronounce that dreadfull sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, <hi>Go ye accursed into everlasting Fire,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>All</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positors agree that <hi>Infernal</hi> Torments are here un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, by being tormented with fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, and the smoak thereof ascending up for ever and ever. But that which follows concerns the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaceableness of mind, and unquietness of conscience in them that have any conscience left in them, if they
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:48067:64"/>
worship the Beast and his Image, by reason that the voice of this Angel will be so loud and clear touching the Idolatrousness of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Unsalvableness of those in her Communion. Which will the more enrage the Pontifician party to perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute and necessitate others that have any conscience left in them to suffer any persecution rather than ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard their own salvation, and turn Idolaters. This will be the most eminently fulfilled, I mean the preaching of the third Angel, under the effusion of the fourth Vial in the Mystical sense thereof, though it has in some measure been fulfilled all along the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and may reach through <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Vials</hi> by a <hi>Geniconaea,</hi> but by an <hi>Idiconaea</hi> more peculiarly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect the <hi>fourth.</hi> But from hence is that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows: <hi>Here is the patience of the Saints,</hi> &amp;c. So that the Remarker and Expositor here agree, That the Monition of the third Angel respects the plagues of the Vials in some sort.</p>

                        <hi>Vers.</hi> 15. The Angel coming out of the <hi>Temple,</hi> does here and elsewhere signifie their coming from the <hi>Throne of God,</hi> where they received his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and justice and judgment being the habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Throne, the righteousness of those com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands may be farther signified. Also they being ministring Spirits attending at the Throne (signified by the seven Lamps burning before it) the <hi>Temple</hi> is their proper abode till they be sent out. But what ground there is to make the <hi>Temple</hi> here to represent the <hi>Church,</hi> I do not apprehend.</p>

                        <hi>Ans.</hi> This conceit of the Remarker would be the more plausible, if the Angel had been said to come from the <hi>Throne.</hi> But every one that went into the <hi>Temple</hi> went not into the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum.</hi> That

The <hi>reaping</hi> of him that fate on a cloud, may signifie the <hi>ascending</hi> of the <hi>Witnesses in a cloud,</hi> or rather the consequences thereof.

But the Angel is said to have power over fire in respect of his executing God's wrath by causing fierce and blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy wars consuming like a fire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In which sense fire is used in the <hi>first Trumpet,</hi> and the <hi>Censer of fire</hi> cast upon the Earth before the Trumpets; And so likewise here the Angel with a sharp sickle being to reap the Vine of the Earth, <hi>viz.</hi> to gather the Antichristian party to battel, is odered thereto by the Angel that had power over fire, <hi>viz.</hi> who (as our Saviour came not to bring peace, but division, and to send a fire on Earth, and as the Rider on the red Horse in the second seal had power to take peace from the Earth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) had power to cause such divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions and commotions as should incense and stir men up to the said battel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                        <hi>Ans.</hi> Upon those words [which had power over the fire] <hi>Peganius</hi> writes thus: <hi>Who in the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,</hi> says he, <hi>of the Heavenly Tabernacle was to have care of the fire upon the Altar, whence now should be kindled the fire of vengeance.</hi> Which is a sense no way inconsistent with mine, <hi>viz.</hi> That this Altar is named in relation to the Martyrdoms under the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Tyranny, and the fire the rather, because their Martyrdom was much by fire, they were burnt as Holocausts to the pride and covetousness of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy. And <hi>Peganius</hi> himself upon those words pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent

[And another Angel came out from the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar] <hi>where the souls of the Martyrs,</hi> says he, <hi>were kept, and whose bloud the Lord would avenge at this time.</hi> But the <hi>fire</hi> of the <hi>Altar</hi> does not signifie wrath and vengeance simply of it self, as appears from <hi>Esay. ch.</hi> 6. where a <hi>live-coal</hi> taken from the Altar by a <hi>Seraphin,</hi> and put to the mouth of the Prophet, is a sign of his <hi>iniquity being taken away,</hi> and of his sin being <hi>purged,</hi> which is not <hi>vengeance,</hi> but <hi>mercy.</hi> And the use of this fire on the Altar was to burn their Sacrifices, which were to <hi>propitiate</hi> God's wrath, not to kindle it. Wherefore these things being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, what a severe sentence is this of the Remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker to say [That the making of mention of fire here is, because of the Martyrdom inflicted by it] is not sense? For it is more perfect and adequate sense than the other. The <hi>Altar</hi> and the <hi>fire</hi> that burnt their Holocausts, compared with the burning of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, which the Pontifician Power burnt as so many Holocausts, to their Pride, Avarice and Cruelty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a more proper and efficacious <hi>Incentive</hi> to pray for vengeance against them than merely the <hi>heat</hi> of <hi>fire</hi> signifying that way, which may as well signifie the <hi>warmth</hi> of <hi>mercy,</hi> the <hi>ardour,</hi> of <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>zeal</hi> for the <hi>conversion</hi> of men as <hi>vengeance.</hi> Nor does the <hi>fire</hi> of <hi>Incense,</hi> Apoc. 8. of it self signifie <hi>wrath</hi> and <hi>ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance,</hi> else <hi>prayer,</hi> which the <hi>fume</hi> of <hi>Incense</hi> signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies could onely be for <hi>vengeance,</hi> which is extremely absurd. But the coals of Incense there are determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to that sense, because the prayers of God's peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had been uttered that way. And the Angel that had the care of the fire on the Altar, (fire signify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the flames of <hi>holy zeal</hi> and <hi>love,</hi> as well as the heat of <hi>wrath</hi> and <hi>revenge</hi>) may call to him that has
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:48067:67"/>
the sharp sickle, according to both these senses, out of <hi>wrath</hi> to destroy one party, and out of <hi>love</hi> and <hi>mercy</hi> to convert the other. For that seems to be an affected mistake in the Remarker, that he makes the Expositor to allot both <hi>vengeance</hi> and <hi>conversion</hi> to the same party. So that the Objection is a mere Cavil.</p>

As the Juice of Grapes troden by horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in a Wine-press would spue out to the horse-bridles, so a great slaughter is here aptly signified by bloud coming out to the horse-bridles in the Wine-press of the wrath of God. But that a perfect victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry over the contumacious by a full conviction of them should be here signified, is the continuance of the strange conceits in the two foregoing verses, turning the <hi>great wrath</hi> of God, which at the great day of God the seventh Trumpet is to be executed upon the obdurate enemies of Christ by that <hi>decisive</hi>

battel betwixt him and them into the <hi>great blessing</hi> of making them Converts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that 1600 fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs should here signifie <hi>Symbolically,</hi> and not <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merically,</hi> is also a groundless conceit. For the <hi>Nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical</hi> signification is the plain easie sense, and there is no intimation of any other sense; whenas the number 666 (which is instanced in to countenance a <hi>Symbolical</hi> sense here) hath the same plainly sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified in the Text, that it is to be taken <hi>symbolically</hi> or <hi>mystically.</hi> And also the same is evident in the wonderfull apt application of it, which in this case altogether fails. Therefore it had been better still to have taken up with Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s conceit, than to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquish it for this undoubted Mystery, which is doubtless a great mistake.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> This is the first news I have heard of Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses being Wine-pressers. Nor is the bloud of the Grape in the Vision said to spurt up to the Horse-bridles in the Wine-press, but to come out of the Wine-press, even to the Horse-bridles, and that for the space of one thousand six hundred furlongs. What, could the bloud spurt so far out of the Wine-press? then certainly it spurted above the Horse-bridles in the Wine-press. <hi>Ribera</hi> most certainly has hit on the most genuine <hi>literal</hi> sense of this pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, who first mentioning that of <hi>Ioel,</hi> ch. 3.13. <hi>Get ye down, for the Wine-press is full, the Wine-fats overflow</hi>; he says, <hi>Iohn</hi> outdoes this expression of the Prophet, whenas he says so much <hi>Mustum</hi> came out from this pressing, that not onely the <hi>Wine-press</hi> was full to the top, but overflowed the neighbouring ground to a thousand six hundred furlongs, and so deep that all the space was unpassable by any foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; and if an horse-man rid in it, it would take
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:48067:68"/>
his Horse up to the bridle. This is assuredly the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie and natural sense of the <hi>letter.</hi> And therefore if the <hi>letter</hi> be to be expounded of a <hi>carnal</hi> warfare, there will be such a battel as will overflow the ground with bloud for sixteen hundred furlongs, that is for two hundred miles together. Which if you suppose in length, as all Interpreters in a manner look that way, and take it for granted that the longitude of the bloudy Tract is intimated, unless there were a chanel made on purpose, it would proportionably spread in breadth. But to make a more favourable construction of it, let these two hundred miles in length spread but a mile in breadth, so that the Tract of bloud may be but 200 square miles, which is but a modest supposition, this slaughter being to be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted by the victorious <hi>Saints,</hi> nothing but either heedlesness or an <hi>efferate religious Melancholy</hi> can make any one conceit so salvage a scene of things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced by them.</p>
                     <p>Besides that, it is infinitely incredible that so vast a multitude of men should be gathered into one field-battel, as that if all their throats were cut, or how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever else they were slain should fill two hundred square miles with bloud up to the horse-bridle. Wherefore the nature of this Symbol here (which is uncapable of the gross <hi>literal</hi> sense) as that also of the <hi>Rider of the white Horse, with a sharp sword going out of his mouth,</hi> and the <hi>Camp</hi> suddenly turn'd into a <hi>tripartite City,</hi> and the <hi>synchronism</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity</hi> of these three Visions that aim all at one thing, may assure any one, that either Prejudice, Heedles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness or Complexion does not hood-wink, that the victory over one part indicated in these Visions is <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual,</hi> viz. their <hi>Conversion</hi>; but as for the other
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:48067:68"/>
part, which is <hi>here</hi> understood, by the <hi>City without which the Wine-press is troden</hi> (and is the same <hi>City,</hi> a tenth part whereof fell at the Rising of the Witnesses,) and in the <hi>seventh Vial,</hi> by <hi>Babylon,</hi> and by the <hi>Beast</hi> and <hi>false Prophet</hi> in the Vision of the Rider of the white Horse, the victory over them is <hi>Political,</hi> and indicates their <hi>confusion.</hi> Not that they are to be mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered neither, but that the City <hi>Babylon,</hi> which is the bloudy Idolatrous Hierarchy, their Revenues will be gone, and their Autority abolished, and the same is to be understood of the <hi>false Prophet,</hi> which is the <hi>City Babylon.</hi> Nor is there any need to understand any other destruction to the <hi>Beast</hi> distinct from the <hi>false Prophet,</hi> than the dissolution of that of his power that constituted him a <hi>Beast</hi> in the <hi>Prophetick</hi> style, <hi>Cruelty</hi> against the Saints, and his upholding <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</hi> Which power being extinct, the Beast is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy'd, but the Legal Sovereignty is preserved for the support of Truth and Purity of God's worship, and Kingdom of his Son, who surely reigns there where his pure Gospel obtains and is maintained by the Magistrate. These things will certainly be. But to interpret these Prophecies of such salvage and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious, nay impossible slaughters, and <hi>that</hi> by the <hi>Saints,</hi> as it is a reproach to them that are truly so, and may animate pretended Saints to tumults and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions, so it does great injury to this book of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies, and seasons the Peoples minds with such false notions, that when they are fulfilled, they will not know they are fulfilled, as it has happened alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in the <hi>Rising of the Witnesses.</hi> The Symbols of those three Visions are such, that any one that has any nasuteness of interpreting of Prophecies, if he give due heed, he must needs conclude that the <hi>slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering</hi>
                        <pb n="114" facs="tcp:48067:69"/>
passages in the battel of the great day of God Almighty is a <hi>Parable.</hi> Nor do they belong to his obdurate Enemies, but to those that have been stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to the Faith, nor had before the like opportunity of knowing the Truth, and being converted. His ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durate enemies rather are to be found in <hi>Babylon,</hi> who though Hail-stones of a Talent weight fall on them, are not made <hi>contrite</hi> thereby, but <hi>blaspheme</hi>; They are obstinate, like the Fool in <hi>Solomon,</hi> whom if you bray in a mortar with a pestil, yet will not his fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishness depart from him, the conceit of Infallibility has so far infatuated them.</p>
                     <p>What remains in the Remark is spoke with a great deal of confidence, though what is alledged against the 1600 furlongs, signifying <hi>Symbolically,</hi> not <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merically,</hi> is exceeding weak. For the <hi>Numerical</hi> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification applied to the extent of the slaughter, is so far from being <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>easie</hi> sense, that it is a sense <hi>incredible,</hi> yea <hi>impossible:</hi> And therefore a <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> Indication, that this slaughter is to be taken in a <hi>Parabolical</hi> sense, such as the Expositor has given. Suppose an Army in the field of a square figure, and that the men were so closely set together, that each of them had but half a pace, or five half-feet squared to turn them in, and that this square Army took up near upon 200 miles, let the <hi>Latus</hi> be but 14 miles and square it. The whole Army will consist of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven hundred eighty four thousand thousand men, (whenas one thousand thousand is ten hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand men) which therefore is near three hundred times a greater Army than that prodigious Army of <hi>Xerxes,</hi> which <hi>Herodotus</hi> says consisted of 2641610 fighting men. Can the Remarker believe that there will ever be such an Army so numerous meeting
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:48067:69"/>
thus in one place? But suppose it, and the bloud of this Army, even of every single Souldier of it to be wholly let out of his body, which is scarce done in any one slain. In a vessel of two foot and half square, how deep would the bloud be? Certainly scarce an Inch. But scarce thirty Inches deep will reach to the Horse-bridle. So that the bloud of an Army a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove thirty times greater than what I have descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, and nine thousand times greater than <hi>Xerxes</hi> his Army will scarce suffice to make such a deluge of bloud, though wholly effused, as to reach 1600 furlongs, I mean 200 square miles, to the Horses bridles. And the <hi>Saints</hi> the Executioners of God's wrath must be the <hi>Butchers</hi> to let out all this bloud: What a monstrous conceit is this? what more incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible? what more impossible? And if we should make our Hypothesis yet more modest, and instead of the 200 square miles, be content with 1600 square furlongs, the root of which would be put 40 fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs or five miles, yet according to this Hypothesis, bloud to the Horse-bridles for such a space, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the slaughter of above a thousand times more men than those in <hi>Xerxes</hi> his Army, though his Army consisted of 2641610 fighting men. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this is a certain sign that the sense is <hi>Parabolical,</hi> and that the number is not <hi>Numerically,</hi> but <hi>Symbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lically</hi> to be taken. Nor needed there any Intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of extracting the square root here, as there is in the Number 666, because that Number is not a perfect square number; and the less need, because this way of extracting the square root was freshly intimated before, in the Number 666, and lay obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the eye in the 144 Regiments or <hi>Chiliarchies</hi> in the beginning of this Chapter, and in these 16

                        <hi>Hecatontads</hi> it does lye as obvious here to an obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant eye, and unprejudiced judgment, if he be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Symbolical meaning of the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternary</hi> or Number <hi>Four.</hi> The aptness of the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication whereof to the present occasion the Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor has fully made out in his Exposition and Notes. And it is notorious ignorance or prejudice in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marker (no mistake in the Expositor) if he be not thence satisfied.</p>

                     <p>THE Introduction to this Chapter does make these <hi>three</hi> places, <hi>ch.</hi> 11. <hi>v.</hi> 15, 16, 17. <hi>ch.</hi> 14. <hi>v.</hi> 8. <hi>ch.</hi> 15. <hi>v.</hi> 2, 3, 4. to signifie the same Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphal Song, which is a <hi>triple</hi> errour: The first being the Doxology at the seventh Trumpet, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond no Song, but the denouncing the commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Babylon</hi>'s fall by the <hi>Waldenses,</hi> the third no Triumphal Song of Victory (though sung by the Victors over the Beast and his Image,) but of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and glorifying God for his judgments by the pouring forth of the seven Vials, then in view in the Angel's hands, so as to make all to fear and glorifie him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> These three places do most certainly refer to the same thing, to the fall of the tenth part of the City of <hi>Babylon,</hi> or the Rising of the Witnesses, which is in a manner the same; They are also three <hi>testifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations</hi> of <hi>Ioy</hi> and <hi>Triumph</hi> upon that notable passage
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:48067:70"/>
of God's Providence, call them <hi>Songs,</hi> or <hi>Doxologies,</hi> or joyfull <hi>Annunciations,</hi> it is all one to the Expositor. The first is a <hi>Doxology</hi> at the seventh Trumpet, but for the <hi>Rising of the Witnesses</hi> immediately mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before. The second is the joyfull <hi>Annunciation</hi> of the good news of <hi>Babylon</hi>'s fall in part, namely the tenth part of the City, which the <hi>Waldenses</hi> could not tell was fallen, nor any for them in their time, for it stood then entire, and so continued for about 400 years after. The third is a <hi>Song</hi> of <hi>Victory,</hi> it being a <hi>Song of the Lamb,</hi> in imitation of that of <hi>Moses,</hi> when they triumphed over <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his host af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they were overthrown in the Red Sea. What can be plainer? And these are said to be <hi>Victors</hi> over the <hi>Beast</hi>; and in the Song it self it is said, All Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions shall worship before thee, because thy <hi>judgments are manifested,</hi> namely upon <hi>Babylon</hi> in the fall of the tenth part of their City, and in the Rising of the Witnesses. How clearly and naturally do these things hang together? Which if it were not, there would be no occasion nor object of this Triumphal Song. For who but fools or mad men triumph before victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? Nor could it be for the <hi>future</hi> pouring forth the Vails then <hi>in view.</hi> For it is not said these <hi>Victors</hi> saw them, but that St. <hi>Iohn</hi> saw them. Nor did St. <hi>Iohn</hi> see them before this Song of the Victors was ended. For the first verse is onely a <hi>general</hi> Title of the Chapter about the Vials. The particular or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of his seeing them is afterwards. For he says ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly, <hi>v.</hi> 5. That <hi>after</hi> this Song of the <hi>Victors</hi> he looked, and behold the Temple of the Tabernacle of Heaven was opened. Which implies it was shut, or his eyes shut to it before. And the seven Angels came out of the Temple, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And it is farther ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:48067:71"/>
from <hi>v.</hi> 7. For one of the four Beasts there mentioned had not given the Vials to the Angels till then. How could the Victors then see them <hi>have</hi> them, <hi>before</hi> they were <hi>given</hi> them? So that this Song will have no Object of praise and thanksgiving. Which is a plain demonstration that the Remarker is in a mistake.</p>

                        <hi>Vers.</hi> 1. The <hi>Beast</hi> is not the <hi>Roman</hi> Hierarchy, but the <hi>Ten-horned</hi> Beast headed by the false Prophet or Roman Hierarchy. It's sufficient to call the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als the seven <hi>last plagues,</hi> if they begin after the sixth Trumpet, and end with the seventh, especially the Trumpets belonging to the <hi>sealed Book,</hi> and the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als to the <hi>opened Book,</hi> and so may rather respect the preceding plagues of the <hi>opened Book,</hi> viz. those said to be inflicted by the Witnesses, and also by the two precedent Angels to the third, who is Monitor of the Vials.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> The Beast here is most certainly the <hi>Roman</hi> Hierarchy or <hi>two-horned</hi> Beast, because <hi>v.</hi> 2. the Victors are said to have got the victory over the Beast, and over his Image; and it is plain, <hi>chap.</hi> 13. That the <hi>Two-horned</hi> Beast was the <hi>Maker</hi> of <hi>this Image:</hi> but it farther follows, And over the <hi>number</hi> of <hi>his name,</hi> which also plainly belongs to the <hi>two-horned</hi> Beast. And as for the seven last plagues (in which is <hi>filled up</hi> the wrath of God against the <hi>said Beast,</hi> which suffered <hi>considerably</hi> in the Rising of the Witnesses) none of them seven can be called the last, which end before the sixth. Those plagues must certainly expire before any of the seven begin, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of which all seven are to be called the last plagues. This is pitifull tearing and forcing of things to serve a fond Hypothesis, that will not hold water.
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:48067:71"/>
Lastly, The second <hi>Wo-Trumpet</hi> being mentioned in the <hi>Opened-book-prophecy,</hi> is a plain Indication that as to order of time and succession of things, the seven last <hi>wofull plagues</hi> in the last <hi>Wo-Trumpet</hi> must suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the second <hi>Wo-Trumpet,</hi> and consequently the fall of <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>Rising</hi> of the <hi>Witnesses,</hi> though all the first six Trumpets belong to the <hi>Sealed-book-prophecy,</hi> as does also the Interval of the seventh. And as for the plagues inflicted by the Witnesses, they were during their 1260 days prophesying, <hi>ch.</hi> 11.6. and therefore the same with the six first plagues, there being no other actually inflicted plagues prefigured but they. And for the two An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, they are no Inflicters of plagues, but Adverti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers touching God's judgments to come, or already fallen on the Idolaters.</p>

Nor was the overthrow that was then given to the Pope by the doctrine of <hi>Iustification,</hi> that being but one particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of the Reformation, but the main of his over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw then was the casting off his Supremacy.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> 
                        <hi rend="sup">a</hi> Though the first Vial were poured out on the Earth in that general sense, doth its pouring forth signifie nothing? It will necessarily hit some parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular thing or person or other, and it particularly hits the marked slaves of the Beast, and inflicts a sore on them, and so every Vial the pouring it forth will mediately or immediately concern the Terra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queous Globe, namely the Inhabitants thereof. But for that special meaning of <hi>Earth,</hi> which the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marker takes notice of, and I have noted to answer to the <hi>Clay</hi> in <hi>Daniel,</hi> and to signifie the <hi>Ecclesiastick</hi> Rank of men, if this in general were understood by the <hi>Earth,</hi> v. 1. it were an Hypothesis very allowa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, yea laudable, being these <hi>Vials</hi> concern the Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifician Hierarchy, which Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> calls <hi>Bestiam An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristianam,</hi> and all reach him either <hi>immediately</hi> or <hi>mediately,</hi> even those that are poured on the <hi>Sun,</hi> into the <hi>Air,</hi> or on the <hi>River Euphrates,</hi> they all touch the concern of the Beast that rose out of the <hi>Earth,</hi> as you may see by the Exposition of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:48067:75"/>
And the <hi>first Vial</hi> poured on the Earth in this sense, reacheth them immediately, it inflicting so noysome and grievous a sore on those that are the marked slaves of the <hi>two-horned</hi> Beast especially, their Interest being so much concerned in the fall of <hi>Babylon</hi> and the <hi>Rising of the Witnesses.</hi> Wherefore that Cup of Intoxication and Dementation through Envy, Malice, Rage and Fury (as it is said <hi>ch.</hi> 11. <hi>v.</hi> 18. upon the Rising of the Witnesses and Doxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy of the Elders, <hi>And the Nations were angry,</hi> which answers to the effect of the effusion of this first Vial, the noysome sore on the marked slaves of the Beast) that Cup, I say, is really the pouring forth of this <hi>first Vial,</hi> which is a grievous plague indeed. <hi>Impedit ira animum</hi> — And <hi>Quos Iupiter vult perdere eosdem dementat prius.</hi> So that by the Remarker's leave these are no sorry conceits, nor the Expositor's private opinion, but the opinion of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Interpreters before him. <hi rend="sup">b</hi> But the Remarker's is a groundless conceit to apply that which belongs to the times <hi>preceding</hi> the Rising of the Witnesses to the Vials, which <hi>come after</hi> their Rising, as is most plain to them that do not wilfully wink against the Truth. Wherefore the War of the <hi>Hussites,</hi> &amp;c. is such a business as the <hi>Albigensian</hi> War; and if justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable, to be referred to the War betwixt the <hi>Beast</hi> and the <hi>Saints,</hi> ch. 13. v. 7. <hi rend="sup">c</hi> Nor has the Remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker any evasion out of this evidence of truth, but by an unworthy vilifying of the Protestant Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which undoubtedly was the <hi>Rising of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,</hi> and most certainly was a very illustrious At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievement of Providence, and quite wiped away that foul face of things, which Custome and Law had established before, and is described in the <hi>Idea</hi>
                        <pb n="128" facs="tcp:48067:76"/>
of <hi>Antichristianism,</hi> and therefore it is most wretched Ingratitude to undervalue so great a Bounty of the Divine Majesty towards his servants; like the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring of the <hi>Israelites</hi> against <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> by whose conduct they were delivered from the bondage and Tyranny of <hi>Pharaoh.</hi> Nor was the Pope's Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy onely rejected, and some gross corruptions, here in the Church of <hi>England</hi> suppose, reformed, but <hi>all</hi> gross corruptions, nor were there any left that can be a just cause of Separation from our Church. But the cavil now forsooth must be, because they retain still <hi>Political</hi> Government (for Popish leaven in matters of Religion, which is reformed to the pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of the Times that were <hi>symmetral,</hi> is plainly outed from our Church) and continue in the same <hi>worldly</hi> state and station (the terms for <hi>Political</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment) as if all <hi>Political</hi> Laws and Orders, though they were made and managed for the support of the Kingdom of God and the purity of his Worship were <hi>worldly.</hi> How <hi>freakish</hi> is this? But how <hi>outragious</hi> to make the Reformed Churches, merely for this cause to continue <hi>Members of the Beast?</hi> This is such a wild Imagination, that it is more becoming those Dreamers St. <hi>Iude</hi> describes, that <hi>despise</hi> domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and <hi>speak evil</hi> of dignities than any sober Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian. <hi rend="sup">d</hi> And lastly, as I remember I noted before, the <hi>Spirit of life</hi> entring into the Witnesses has not a <hi>Spiritual</hi> sense, but <hi>Political.</hi> And the <hi>Genius</hi> of Prophetick <hi>Iconisms,</hi> and of the Apocalyptick Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, is rather to adumbrate the <hi>External</hi> and visible state of the Church than the <hi>Internal.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is onely one thing remaining in this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, at the beginning, that I may seem to have slipt over, <hi>viz.</hi> That the effect of the <hi>first Vial,</hi>
                        <pb n="129" facs="tcp:48067:76"/>
namely that <hi>rankorous sore</hi> does not seem to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to the <hi>effusion of the Vial,</hi> but to the <hi>Rising of the Witnesses.</hi> But I answer, that it is sufficient that this sore rages in the time of the Vial-Angel. For here are seven distinct Times allotted to the seven <hi>Vial-Angels,</hi> as there are seven distinct times allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the seven <hi>Trumpet-Angels,</hi> and what happens in the said allotted times is attributed to the Angel to whom the time is alloted, whether the Angel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute any thing to it or no. Nor does any one ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that the <hi>Locusts</hi> and <hi>Euphratean Horse-men</hi> were <hi>blown</hi> out of the fifth and sixth Angels Trumpets, but that those things happened under the times al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted to them. And the Rider of the red Horse un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>second Seal,</hi> he is said to take peace from the Earth, merely because in his time there were such kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and slaying one another. And it is something Idiotical to think otherwise of these things. But sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing there must be some <hi>real activity</hi> in this first <hi>Vial-Angel</hi> for the inflicting this angry Aegyptian boil, there is not the least absurdity in allowing it, <hi>viz.</hi> That as an evil spirit from the Lord haunted <hi>Saul</hi> when his Melancholy fits came upon him, so this first <hi>Vial-Angel</hi> may commissionate some spirits, upon the envy and the anger the <hi>Bestians</hi> had concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved against the <hi>Risen Witnesses,</hi> to actuate them with more than ordinary rage and madness against them, and so infatuate their counsel by this distemper. This, I hope, will take away all scruple touching this first Vial.</p>

The perfect <hi>Revulsion</hi> of these great Parts of the <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifician Iurisdiction</hi> from those that his power still did actuate and enliven; and the hindering them from reuniting for a due time, till they were turned into the <hi>congealed bloud,</hi> as it were <hi>of a dead man; this</hi> was the <hi>effusion</hi> of the <hi>second Vial,</hi> and plainly distinct from the first, and such as to which the first might well contribute. For the marked slaves of the Beast being <hi>dementated</hi> with wrath, would necessarily doe such things as would excite the other party to use all possible care and diligence, courage and resolution to make all sure against them for the future. The <hi>second Vial</hi> therefore is not the <hi>Rising of the Witnesses</hi> or the <hi>first appearance</hi> of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> but it bears
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:48067:77"/>
that analogy to the <hi>Rising of the Witnesses,</hi> that the descending of the <hi>New Ierusalem</hi> under the <hi>second Thunder</hi> (which comprizes the settlement of the <hi>Millennial</hi> Empire of Christ) does to the victory of the Rider of the white Horse under the <hi>first.</hi>

The word of God is no subject capable of pouring a <hi>Vial</hi> thereon: And as for the clear con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victive Explications thereof, this as to those that are convinced thereby is not a <hi>punishment</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>Vial</hi> of wrath) but a <hi>blessing:</hi> And so if it be taken to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the conversion of any Emperour or Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> I noted at first that all the Vials are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be poured on the <hi>Earth</hi>; which if we consider seriously, must needs be understood in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward sense, of the <hi>two-horned</hi> Beast that came out of the <hi>Earth</hi> or <hi>Clay.</hi> And therefore on whatever they are said to be poured, they must reach <hi>this Earth</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>mediately</hi> or <hi>immediately, directly</hi> or <hi>indirectly,</hi> that is, <hi>reflexively,</hi> or else the <hi>Angels</hi> do not obey the <hi>Divine Command.</hi> But if the effusion of the <hi>Vial</hi> reach the <hi>two-horned</hi> Beast to detriment him, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>mediately</hi> or <hi>immediately,</hi> it is poured on the <hi>Earth,</hi> and the Divine Command is fulfilled. And in this sense a <hi>Vial</hi> may be poured on the <hi>Word of God,</hi> which may illuminate Emperours, Kings or Princes to the great damage of the <hi>two-horned</hi> Beast, and so rightly be said to be poured on the <hi>Earth,</hi> though it be first discharged on the <hi>Sun</hi> in those senses the Expositor intimates.</p>

Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the <hi>root</hi> of the Beast's <hi>Autority</hi> seems to be struck
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:48067:78"/>
at, <hi>viz.</hi> That whenas the <hi>precedent Vial</hi> poured on the <hi>Sun,</hi> and scorching men with great heat, seems to signifie mens being <hi>zealously incensed,</hi> and so sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>inveying</hi> against, and <hi>reproving</hi> the corruptions and oppressions of the <hi>Antichristian</hi> Powers then ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; <hi>this Vial</hi> seems to proceed farther, and to strike at the <hi>Root</hi> of their Autority, <hi rend="sup">c</hi> asserting the right of Christ to rule, and his Laws of Truth to be obey'd, and so all powers that obstruct the advancement of his Kingdom to be enemies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore it's likely to be the Result of the <hi>Rising of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> This is an Assertion quite contrary to that necessary Hypothesis in explaining the effusion of the <hi>Vials,</hi> whose Object is the <hi>two-horned</hi> Beast. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, if this seat signifie <hi>Rome,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> would have it, this indeed the Dragon gave to the <hi>ten-horned</hi> Beast, but it is plain the <hi>two-horned</hi> Beast possesses it, nay he has usurped the <hi>secular</hi> power also <hi>in ordine ad spiritualia,</hi> so that it is a vain thing to understand here any Beast but the <hi>two-horned,</hi> at whom the whole Vision of the <hi>Vials</hi> does aim. The Residue of the Remark is marvellous (unless I mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>understand the Remarker's meaning) which supposes <hi>bitter Invectives</hi> against the <hi>Sun,</hi> that is the secular Powers Antichristian, like the barking of dogs against the Moon, to be the pouring forth of the <hi>Vial</hi> upon the <hi>Sun.</hi> Certainly that Angel that does thus, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes his Instructions. For he was to pour his <hi>Vial</hi> upon the <hi>Earth</hi> from that <hi>general</hi> command, and here he pours it upon the <hi>Sun</hi> without any reference to the <hi>Earth.</hi> Besides that, this account of this <hi>fourth Vial,</hi> by the Remarker, is very dilute and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>distinct, he making the <hi>Sun</hi> to signifie <hi>any secular</hi>
                        <pb n="133" facs="tcp:48067:78"/>
Antichristian Power, and the effusion of this <hi>Vial</hi> upon it nothing but the <hi>grumbling</hi> of some <hi>male-contents</hi> against their Governours, and <hi>inveying</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their administration of affairs, because they sute not with their humour or interest. Which is a thing done by some or other so repeatedly or conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually in all Governments (which are never free from such spirits) that it is impossible this should be a <hi>particular</hi> character of any of the <hi>Vials.</hi> And moreover it is a plain contradiction to the Text it self, which runs thus: <hi>The fourth Angel poured out his Vial on the Sun, and power was given him to scorch men with fire.</hi> Whom then can he be thought to scorch but those that have so incensed him? So that the plague will be on them that invey against the Antichristian Powers or the Beast, which is contrary to the drift of the Vision, and to the mention of the <hi>blasphemy</hi> of them that are scorched. This is fond enough I think. But something follows still worse, and more foul and fond (if, as I said before, I rightly understand him.) <hi rend="sup">b</hi> What <hi>Achmetes,</hi> what <hi>Artemido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> ever taught the Remarker, that the <hi>seat</hi> of a secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Potentate signifies the <hi>root</hi> of his Autority? This must be in some Countrey, pardon the pleasantness of the conceit, where mens <hi>Chairs</hi> grow to their <hi>Breech,</hi> even as the <hi>Root</hi> and the <hi>Trunk</hi> or <hi>Stalk</hi> of a <hi>Plant</hi> grow together. But as the fancy is forced, so the doctrine therein implied is unsound in his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of these two <hi>Vials, fourth</hi> and <hi>fifth.</hi> And besides, that gloss on the fifth is nothing but that stale <hi>Calvinistical</hi> or rather <hi>Iesuitical</hi> Principle, a <hi>weak</hi> and wicked falshood, not a <hi>stinging</hi> truth that should make them gnaw their tongues for pain, <hi>viz. Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium

sundatur in gratia.</hi> Which <hi>Vial</hi> has been pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out so long that methinks it should be empty by this, or never be empty till the <hi>Millennium,</hi> and so <hi>this</hi> Application will have the same <hi>diluteness</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>distinctness</hi> that the <hi>former.</hi> To rail against the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tority one lives under is against the duty of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian. The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> says, <hi>Thou shalt not speak evil of the Ruler of thy people,</hi> Act. 23.5. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle <hi>Peter</hi> describes the worst of men thus: 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.10. <hi>They despise Government, presumptuous are they, self-willed, they are not afraid to speak evil of digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</hi> To which add that of <hi>Iude; yet</hi> Michael <hi>the Archangel, when contending with the Devil, he dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted about the body of</hi> Moses, <hi>durst not bring against him a railing accusation</hi> (though you may be sure he was in the right) <hi>but said the Lord rebuke thee.</hi> Certainly none of the <hi>Antichristian</hi> Powers can be worse than the <hi>Devil</hi> the Prince of Darkness, nor any of the <hi>reprehensive Saints</hi> greater or more holy than <hi>Michael,</hi> which I note that they that take them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be <hi>Saints</hi> may learn good manners of him. <hi rend="sup">c</hi> And then for the striking at the <hi>root</hi> of <hi>Autority</hi> in pretence of <hi>Christ's right</hi> to rule, and his Laws of Truth to be obey'd: If this be the result of the <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the Witnesses to come,</hi> God be thanked that they are <hi>risen already,</hi> and that this is but a dream, and are ready to instruct all the world, and have done it upon occasion. That <hi>every soul is to be subject to the higher powers: For the powers that be are ordained of God; whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the Ordinance of God; and they that resist, shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to themselves damnation.</hi> And yet the Powers then, touching which St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks, were not onely <hi>Antichristian</hi> in some sense, but mere <hi>Pagan.</hi> But
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:48067:79"/>
from this we may understand, that the <hi>Root</hi> of all <hi>Autority</hi> is God himself. And therefore they are Witnesses <hi>with a witness,</hi> that in pretence of Christ's right to rule, will strike at the <hi>Root</hi> of all Autority, God himself, and be guilty of a <gap reason="foreign">

                        <hi rend="sup">a</hi> It is impossible but that there should be a <hi>Commutation</hi> of <hi>Iconisms</hi> in this Vision. For the fore part of the Vision, from <hi>v.</hi> 13. to <hi>v.</hi> 17. represents the forces of all the Kings of the Earth, those of the <hi>Dragon's</hi> party, <hi>viz.

Wherefore the same thing to be predicted, is continued, but by a <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> of <hi>Iconisms,</hi> and the <hi>tripartite</hi> forces in the <hi>field</hi> are represented by a <hi>mighty City</hi> divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>three</hi> parts, and the <hi>Battel</hi> is represented by those <hi>Boanergeses</hi> the preaching part of the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Host <hi>thundering</hi> over this great City, and the success by declaring that the <hi>Cities of

the Nations,</hi> that is, the <hi>Infidels,</hi> they <hi>fell,</hi> were <hi>thunder-struck,</hi> converted to the pure Apostolick faith by the powerfull preaching of these Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists. But it is said of <hi>Babylon,</hi> which is part of this great City, that Hailstones of a talent weight fell upon her; but instead of being <hi>converted,</hi> she <hi>blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed</hi>; but that she was <hi>vanquished</hi> in a <hi>Political</hi> sense, is plain from the Description. A man must wink hard that can keep his eyes from intromitting so clear a Truth. But now to what the Remarker alledges, I say; <hi rend="sup">b</hi> How can the dividing of the City into three parts be the consequence of the Battel in <hi>Armageddon,</hi> when there's no fighting there, nor the <hi>Vial</hi> poured out till <hi>v.</hi> 17? And the <hi>great City</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering to the <hi>tripartite</hi> forces drawn out into the fields of <hi>Armageddon,</hi> viz. <hi>Infidel, Antichristian</hi> and <hi>Evangelical,</hi> the said City must contain the same, but this <hi>Tripartition</hi> the Remarker would take up with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, leaves out the <hi>Evangelical</hi> party, and makes the <hi>Antichristian</hi> party <hi>two,</hi> whenas, <hi>quatenus</hi> Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, they are but one party, and ought to be so ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted. And lastly, for the <hi>third</hi> party <hi>slain</hi> with the <hi>sword</hi>; here's no mention of <hi>slaying</hi> with the <hi>sword</hi> in this Vision, but of the <hi>Cities of the Nations</hi> being <hi>Thunder-struck.</hi> To all which you may add, that the <hi>Beast</hi> and the <hi>false Prophet</hi> were as much <hi>two</hi> before the fight as after, and those <hi>slain</hi> with the <hi>sword, viz.</hi> the <hi>Draconick</hi> party were <hi>one part</hi> of this <hi>Tripartition</hi> as much before as after the fight. So that the <hi>fight</hi> could be no cause of this <hi>Tripartition.</hi> Nor is there any true <hi>Tripartition</hi> but what was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Conflict, and which was of the <hi>whole</hi> num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the forces, <hi>Evangelical, Antichristian</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidel,</hi> into <hi>those three</hi> parts.

It's a great reproach to the <hi>Evangelical</hi> party to reckon it part of the City of <hi>Babylon,</hi> out of which they were come before in obedience to the voice, <hi>Come out of her my people,</hi> &amp;c. But the three parts of the City (<hi>viz.</hi> that the Antichristian party was composed of) are the <hi>Beast's,</hi> the <hi>false Prophet's,</hi> and the <hi>Dragon's</hi> party, answerable to the three un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean spirits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the three parts it was divided into are as is mentioned on <hi>v.</hi> 16.</p>

                        <hi>BLasphemy</hi> is to be taken here in the sense spoken of, <hi>ch.</hi> 13. as well as to signifie <hi>Idolatry</hi>; and so far as it intends <hi>Idolatry,</hi> it respects that which is committed by worshipping or idolizing the <hi>Beast,</hi> as well as what is by the <hi>Beast's</hi> worshipping of <hi>Idols</hi>; the former, though not so heinous, being of larger extent than the latter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> What a fond strained conceit that is of the Remarker to stretch the meaning of <hi>Blasphemy</hi> here to the sharp reproofs given to immorigerous Saints, as some fansie themselves that deserve not the Title, I have noted <hi>ch.</hi> 13. But here is an Addition, That by the Names of Blasphemy written on the Beast, must be understood also the <hi>idolizing</hi> of the <hi>Beast,</hi> or worshipping him. By this rate all the <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Angels</hi> in Heaven will be <hi>full</hi> of names of <hi>Blasphemy,</hi> the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> especially. But what Pen would ever set out the <hi>Idolatrous</hi> worship given to them from multitudes of people, by describing them <hi>full</hi> of names of <hi>Blasphemy</hi>? This it is to affect freaks and conceits of ones own, contrary to the current of all Expositors.</p>

                        <hi>Vers.</hi> 8. The <hi>Ten-horned</hi> Beast signifies the <hi>Civil Politick</hi> State of the Empire, and so hath its deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination from the corruptions thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences, oppressions, and crafty fraudulent manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of affairs which attend <hi>worldly</hi> Governments. Therefore though their being <hi>Idolatrous</hi> may influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence them to make them more corrupt, yet it makes
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:48067:83"/>
no alteration in the <hi>Civil</hi> State of affairs to give a new denomination thereto. So that the <hi>sixth-headed</hi> Beast continues the <hi>same</hi> after the Empire being Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, till it receive the deadly wound by a sword, <hi>viz. till its ruine by the Barbarous Nations</hi>; and the <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth-headed</hi> Beast that is to continue but a little while is (according to <hi>Forbes</hi>) the <hi>Ostrogothian</hi> Kings (adding thereto the preceding Reign of <hi>Odoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer</hi>) about the expiring of the reign of which Kings happened divers Prodigies significant of the <hi>false Prophet</hi> or <hi>two-horned</hi> Beast (<hi>viz.</hi> the eighth Head) beginning to reign. And if the said Kings be not the seventh Head, they will be taken <hi>no notice of</hi> in the Prophecy, though their reign be almost as long as the Christian Emperours, who are here made the <hi>seventh Head,</hi> and how much shorter it is than the reign of the other, it sutes so much the better with that Head its being to continue <hi>but a little time.</hi> And the dominion of those Kings was so ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute, that the eighth Head could not begin to reign untill their expulsion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And if <hi>they</hi> were the <hi>seventh Head,</hi> then the <hi>Heathen</hi> and <hi>Christian</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours make but <hi>one</hi> Head, and so the same Beast continues, as I said, under the reign of both, and therefore is not so denominated on a <hi>religious,</hi> but on the <hi>civil</hi> account aforesaid.</p>
                     <p>Which is farther evident from the signification of <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>wild Beast,</hi> and the Beast is so named for the same reason, that <hi>Ierusalem</hi> is called a <hi>Lioness,</hi> and her Kings <hi>Lions, Ezek.</hi> 19. and <hi>Nimrod</hi> a mighty Hunter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And how early all worldly Rulers were noted for violence and oppression, appears by that saying of <hi>Iob,</hi> ch. 9.24. <hi>The Earth is given into the hands of the wicked, he covereth the faces of the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:48067:83"/>
Iudges thereof; if not, where, and who is he?</hi> And <hi>Solomon</hi> says, <hi>He beheld the place of judgment that iniquity was there, the place of righteousness that wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness was there:</hi> And the oppressions done under the Sun made him praise the dead more than the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. And <hi>Psalm</hi> 82. God reproving the Rulers of the Earth for judging unjustly, and accepting the person of the wicked, and neglecting to defend the poor and fatherless, and to doe justice to the afflicted and needy; it's added, <hi>They know not, neither will they understand: they walk on in darkness, all the foundations of the Earth are out of course.</hi> So that though the Earth be in such a disorder and dissolved condition, by reason of their evil Government (as on the same occasion it is said, <hi>Psal</hi> 75.3. <hi>The Earth and all the Inhabitants thereof are dissolved,</hi>) yet they are like to proceed in the same course. Hence the Psalmist concludes, <hi>Arise, O God, judge the Earth, for thou shalt inherit all Nations</hi>; signifying, that no better is to be expected till he arise to judge the Earth, who is to inherit all Nations. Doubtless there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Beast</hi> his being called <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, does chiefly, if not onely, respect the <hi>evil administration of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>What is here said to be the <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>natural</hi> sense of that Description: [The Beast that was, and is not, and yet is] is <hi>forced,</hi> and even <hi>frivolous.</hi> But the <hi>true</hi> sense is <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>weighty, viz.</hi> The Beast that was in the Empire, under the Emperours, whether Pagan or Christian, which ceased to be when it had its deadly wound by a sword, <hi>viz.</hi> was destroy'd by the Incursion of the Barbarous Nations, and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours extinguished in <hi>Augustulus, viz.</hi> the Empire then ceased to be the <hi>Roman</hi> Beast, or a Politick
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:48067:84"/>
body governed by the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws, and headed by a <hi>Roman</hi> Prince; <hi>Odoacer</hi> then succeeding, and the <hi>Ostrogothian</hi> Kings to him, who being foreign Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, getting to rule, and continuing to govern by the sword, and not according to the Laws and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Romans,</hi> are therefore rightly reckoned a new or seventh Head. But after their Expulsion, the foreign Nations settled in the Empire began to be formed into a Politick Body according to the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws, which to that end were collected and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished in the <hi>Pandects, Code, Novels,</hi> &amp;c. by <hi>Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian,</hi> who expelled the <hi>Ostrogoths</hi>; And those Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons thus formed in subjection to the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws became the <hi>Image</hi> of the former Beast; to complete which Image, the new <hi>German</hi> Emperours were set up. And the false Prophet or Antichristian eighth head of <hi>Rome</hi> did so promote and countenance this new Model of the Empire, and caused such obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to be given thereunto by the Autority he usurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as was really a <hi>giving life</hi> to this <hi>Image</hi>; And in respect of the whole sway he obtained in matters of <hi>Religion,</hi> and that he had also in <hi>civil</hi> affairs <hi>in ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne ad spiritualia,</hi> he became truly the Head of the <hi>Ten-horned</hi> Beast. But the government which that Beast exercised according to the new <hi>Politick</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del of <hi>Roman</hi> Laws (which became the common Law of the Nations setled in the Empire, though Statute or customary Laws were added thereunto) it's in <hi>respect thereof</hi> called the <hi>Image</hi> of the Beast, <hi>viz.</hi> of the former Beast, which was wounded to Death, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> This is a <hi>large</hi> Remark, and therefore hath room for <hi>many</hi> errours. The first is, That a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or Empire is called a <hi>Beast</hi> in the Prophetick
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:48067:84"/>
style, from the violences, oppressions, and crafty fraudulent management of affairs within themselves; as if it were such a wild Beast that it <hi>tore</hi> and <hi>devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red</hi> its <hi>own</hi> flesh, which it must do if in this regard it is called a Beast or <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, a wild Beast. But a <hi>whole Kingdom</hi> or Empire being but <hi>one entire Beast,</hi> its wildness and cruelty is to be understood of its ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening upon <hi>other</hi> Beasts, that is, Kingdoms or Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires, or those that belong unto them, and are part of them. This is the constant sense of a <hi>Beast</hi> in the <hi>Prophetick</hi> style. And is repeatedly so in <hi>Daniel</hi> and the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> but with a more <hi>precise</hi> regard to a certain <hi>Kingdom,</hi> which is the Kingdom of the <hi>son of man,</hi> which was inchoated in the <hi>Iews,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged under <hi>Christianity,</hi> but will come to its full extent and glory in the <hi>Millennial</hi> Empire of Christ, upon the overthrow of the Kingdom of <hi>Antichrist.</hi> This Kingdom of the <hi>Son of man</hi> is set in opposition to the Kingdoms of those several <hi>Beasts</hi> in <hi>Daniel</hi> and the <hi>Apocalypse.</hi> And whenas <hi>Mildness</hi> and <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity,</hi> and <hi>pure, spiritual, rational</hi> Religion belongs to <hi>Man, fierceness</hi> and <hi>cruelty,</hi> and a <hi>proneness</hi> to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship <hi>outward garish objects</hi> (as is observable in the <hi>Cercopithecus</hi> and <hi>Elephant,</hi> see <hi>Mystery of Godliness,</hi> Book 2. ch. 10.) belongs to <hi>Beasts.</hi> Whence <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> is rightly conceived to include <hi>Idolatry</hi> in it as well as <hi>Cruelty.</hi> And because the <hi>Saracens</hi> and <hi>Turks</hi> are not guilty of this <hi>external</hi> gross <hi>Idolatry,</hi> though they had <hi>Cruelty</hi> enough to be represented under the Type of ravenous <hi>wild Beasts,</hi> yet that is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined, and they are represented, the <hi>one</hi> under the form of <hi>Locusts,</hi> but with the faces of <hi>men,</hi> and the other under the Type of strange <hi>Centaurs</hi> or <hi>Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> where the <hi>humane form</hi> comes in again. This
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:48067:85"/>
were enough one would think to confirm us in the opinion of <hi>Grotius</hi> and <hi>Iacchiades,</hi> that such Empires are as much, or rather more to be esteemed <hi>wild</hi> Beasts for their <hi>Idolatry</hi> than their <hi>Cruelty.</hi> But they are called <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>wild</hi> Beasts more <hi>properly,</hi> and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for their being <hi>Man-keen,</hi> that they will fall upon and devour <hi>men,</hi> that is, the <hi>Subjects</hi> of the Kingdom of the <hi>Son of man,</hi> which is a <hi>rational</hi> Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and who are for a <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, not for the <hi>brutish</hi> worship of <hi>Idolatrous</hi> Empires or Kingdoms. Nor does either <hi>Daniel</hi> or the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> take notice of any Kingdoms under the notion of <hi>Beasts,</hi> but such as be <hi>Idolatrous</hi> and <hi>raven</hi> upon the <hi>Subjects</hi> of the Kingdom of the <hi>Son of man,</hi> so that their <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical</hi> order amongst themselves is not regarded, but their <hi>Idolatry</hi> and <hi>Cruelty</hi> upon the <hi>Subjects</hi> of the <hi>Son of man</hi> for not submitting to their <hi>Idolatry.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, His application of this his <hi>false</hi> Notion to the <hi>Ten-horned</hi> Beast in this place, is wonderfull bold and daring, as if by the <hi>Beast</hi> here described onely the <hi>Political</hi> or <hi>Secular</hi> State were understood, whenas the Text expresly says, That this <hi>Ten-horned</hi> Beast was <hi>full</hi> of names of <hi>Blasphemy,</hi> that is, of <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,</hi> according to all Expositors. Nothing can be more <hi>fully</hi> expressed than this concerning the <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries</hi> of the Beast, and the Scarlet colour onely, if that, intimates his <hi>cruelty.</hi> Therefore it is not so much the <hi>Civil, Politick</hi> State of the Empire, as the <hi>Religion</hi> of the Empire established by Law that <hi>Iohn</hi>'s description of the <hi>Beast</hi> aims at. And the <hi>Religion</hi> of the Empire established by <hi>Law</hi> is as much the <hi>Law</hi> of the Empire, and as <hi>essential</hi> to such a <hi>Beast</hi> as the <hi>Civil</hi> Institutes are; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it must necessarily give a new denomination
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:48067:85"/>
to the Empire when the <hi>established Religion</hi> is <hi>chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</hi> But the <hi>Civil</hi> State alone is not the <hi>Beast</hi> or Empire <hi>Iohn</hi> describes. Nay the <hi>Civil</hi> Laws are not at all involved in his description, but onely the several forms of Sovereignty, as if he meant onely to characterize the Beast from the state of <hi>Religion,</hi> not from <hi>Civil</hi> Laws.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, It is a false Principle in general the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marker supposes, that the Spirit of Prophecy is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd chiefly in prefiguring the changes of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil State in Kingdoms, especially in the Visions of the <hi>Opened-book-prophecy,</hi> which concerns the affairs of the <hi>Church</hi> and purity of <hi>God's Worship,</hi> as I noted above. So that he does <hi>toto coelo errare</hi> in these wild rambles of his.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly therefore, It is impossible that the <hi>sixth-headed</hi> Beast should continue the same after it was turned <hi>Christian.</hi> It were more tolerable to conceive that, if all the <hi>Civil</hi> Laws had been abrogated, and the same Pagan Religion retained with the same Ranks of Magistrates, that the Beast would have continued the same. For in the sense of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick</hi> style it is <hi>Idolatry</hi> alone with <hi>Cruelty,</hi> espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially against the <hi>Subjects</hi> of the Kingdom of the <hi>Son of man,</hi> that makes an Empire a <hi>Beast.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, The <hi>Incursion</hi> of the <hi>Barbarous</hi> Nations, unless they were the <hi>first</hi> Extinguishers of the <hi>Pagan Religion,</hi> could not be the givers of that deadly wound to the Beast by a sword. But that wound was given before by the hand of <hi>Michael</hi> in the Combat of the <hi>Primitive</hi> Christians, with their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutours under the <hi>red Dragon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="148" facs="tcp:48067:86"/>Sixthly, The <hi>Ostrogothian</hi> Kings cannot be the <hi>seventh Sovereignty</hi> of the Empire, (for the <hi>seventh Head</hi> they are not to be called, because there are but seven Heads <hi>in all</hi> of the Beasts, and the <hi>eighth Sovereignty</hi> is one of them) the <hi>Ten-horned</hi> Beast signifying the <hi>whole</hi> Empire. But the <hi>Ostrogothian</hi> Kings were Masters of but a <hi>small pittance</hi> thereof. This is a palpable demonstration of the falsity of <hi>Forbes</hi> his conceit. And therefore there is no infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the <hi>Christian</hi> and <hi>Pagan</hi> Caesars to be but <hi>one</hi> So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty from this Topick, and that therefore the Civil <hi>Polity</hi> is onely considered, not the Religion of the Empire.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, That is also a great piece of ignorance to call the eighth <hi>King</hi> the eighth <hi>Head,</hi> which I glanced at before. For the Vision says expresly, that the Beast had but <hi>seven Heads,</hi> upon which seven Heads were the <hi>Names of Blasphemy,</hi> chap. 13. Which shews plainly that the slaying of the Beast was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that <hi>King</hi> or <hi>Head</hi> of the Empire (though <hi>not</hi> of the <hi>Beast</hi>) who was not <hi>Idolatrous,</hi> and that was the Christian <hi>Emperours, Constantine</hi>
                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c. Which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain is a plain evidence that the Empire is called <hi>Beast</hi> quatenus <hi>Idolatrous.</hi> Who can resist so clear light?</p>
                     <p>Eighthly, The <hi>Ostrogothian</hi> Kings reign in <hi>Rome,</hi> if it be taken no notice of in this <hi>Opened-book-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy,</hi> there is not one half-penny worth of harm done, this Prophecy respecting <hi>Religion</hi> and the <hi>Church,</hi> not <hi>civil</hi> changes in the Empire. This one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly farther confirms that Principle so usefull in it self, but so neglected by the Remarker; and that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marker also has no ground to make the <hi>Pagan</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours and <hi>Christian</hi> Emperours but one Head or
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:48067:86"/>
King, that he might infer the Conclusion he so dotes on. That the <hi>Ten-horned</hi> Beast signifies onely the <hi>Civil</hi> State of the Empire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Ninthly, I have abundantly proved, that <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <hi>stylo prophetico</hi> signifies an <hi>Idolatrous</hi> Polity or Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, so that it is needless here to repeat it, nor does the accumulation of so many places of Scripture at all enervate what I have said; but onely intimate the Male-administration of affairs in each Empire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst themselves, which is not the meaning of <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> in the <hi>Prophetick</hi> Visions, but it means Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Empires persecuting the true Church. And</p>
                     <p>Lastly, Whereas the Remarker says, that what the Expositor calls the <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>natural</hi> sense of that Description of the Beast, [The Beast that was, is not, and yet is] is <hi>forced</hi> and even <hi>frivolous,</hi> there wants no farther confutation of this <hi>uncivil</hi> reproach, than what is already said on this Remark, and may be read in the Exposition of this present verse in <hi>Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lypsis Apocalypseos</hi>; but that the Remarker's sense is <hi>such,</hi> nay <hi>corsly false</hi> and <hi>impertinent,</hi> I shall now fully make evident, if it may convince him of his errour. I shall answer to every material particular there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
                     <p>First therefore, whereas he saith; <hi>The Beast that was is the Empire, under the Emperours, whether Pagan or Christian:</hi> This assertion is <hi>grosly false</hi> (besides the defect in omitting all the Heads pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding the Pagan Emperours.) For the Empire un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Christian</hi> Emperours, before they became <hi>Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nochristian,</hi> was not a <hi>Beast,</hi> that was the Interval in which it was true of the Beast to say, <hi>It is not,</hi> as may clearly appear out of what has been said alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to the Remarker's first, second, and seventh er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,

and briefly out of the description of the Beast by <hi>Iohn.</hi> It is a Beast <hi>full of Blasphemies,</hi> that is, <hi>hugely Idolatrous.</hi> This Beast therefore ceased to be under the <hi>Christian Emperours.</hi> And if <hi>Idolatry</hi> be not of the essence of this Beast, the Beast will have <hi>eight</hi> Heads, which is <hi>grosly repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> to the Vision.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Whereas he saith, <hi>That this Beast ceased to be upon the Incursion of the Barbarous Nations, and the Emperours extinguished in</hi> Augustulus, <hi>and the Rule then under</hi> Odoacer <hi>and the</hi> Ostrogothian <hi>Kings, being not by the</hi> Roman <hi>Laws, but by the sword:</hi> here again the Remarker is quite out of the story. For though the Incursion of the <hi>Barbarians</hi> did <hi>vex</hi> the Empire, yet it did not destroy it, but they were as <hi>Morbifick</hi> matter, and preternatural or febricitant heat in the Body <hi>natural,</hi> which implies not <hi>actual Death,</hi> but a <hi>Disease</hi> onely. Nor were the <hi>Civil</hi> Laws of the Empire abrogated, but were still in use, though their course might be here and there something interrupted or obstructed as the course of the bloud is in a diseased body. And for <hi>Odoacer</hi> and the <hi>Ostrogothian</hi> Kings in <hi>Italy,</hi> it is plain out of <hi>Carolus Sigonius, De Imperio Occi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentali, lib.</hi> 15. and 16. That <hi>Theodoricus,</hi> and so of his Successours, they supported the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws and Magistracies. <hi>Senatum, Consules, Patritios caete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rósque qui fuerant in Imperio Magistratus retinuit</hi>; and a little after, <hi>Atque omninò instituit regnum ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teris Imperii ex omni parte simillimum.</hi> Wherefore the Empire could not cease to be the <hi>Roman</hi> Beast upon the <hi>Ostrogothian</hi> King's Rule, they retaining still the <hi>Roman</hi> Magistracies and Laws, though they were not of the <hi>Roman</hi> bloud; for several Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:48067:87"/>
before were not. To which you may add, that <hi>Theodoricus</hi> was sent as a Viceroy by <hi>Zeno</hi> the Eastern Emperour; and that <hi>Zeno</hi> was then the Head of the Empire the <hi>Ten-horned</hi> Beast, that is, of the whole Empire the Western <hi>Caesars</hi> failing. And therefore.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Whereas he affirms the <hi>Ostrogothian</hi> Kings to be the <hi>seventh Head</hi> of the Empire, it is apparent he is grosly out, both upon the former ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, as also because it is plainly ridiculous and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible that the <hi>Ostrogothian</hi> Kings, whose Jurisdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion reached to such a small scantling, should be the Head of the <hi>Ten-horned</hi> Beast, which signifies the whole Empire.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Whereas he tells us, that the subjection of the barbarous Nations to the Political <hi>Roman</hi> Laws, collected by <hi>Iustinian,</hi> was the making of the Image of the Beast, that is again a conceit impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. For as much as the <hi>Image of the Beast</hi> is the <hi>Image of the Red Dragon,</hi> whose character is <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi> and <hi>Persecution</hi>; and therefore the Remarker here stands in his own light, that would restrain his sense to <hi>Political</hi> or <hi>Civil</hi> Laws, not Laws about <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi> But as for Civil Laws, I proved before they did obtain, so that <hi>Iustinian</hi> did not play the <hi>Painter</hi> to draw an <hi>Image</hi> of the <hi>Beast,</hi> but rather the <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician,</hi> that cured the Beast of a Fever, and gave the course of Law more free passage, which is as the bloud and life in a body <hi>Politick</hi> And besides this, it is suggested in History, that <hi>Iustinian</hi> was not so good a <hi>Painter</hi> as to draw a true Image of the Beast his under Work-men failing him. For <hi>Tribonianus,</hi> who was the greatest Lawyer, and most in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, it is said of him, that he was a covetous fellow,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:48067:88"/>
and did <hi>pretio leges figere &amp; refigere,</hi> make and null Laws merely for money. In the <hi>Code,</hi> says <hi>Slei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan, Quam plurimae sunt</hi> Justiniani <hi>Leges quae superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oribus derogant.</hi> And the <hi>Novels</hi> the Remarker men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions bear no good <hi>Omen</hi> in their Name. They were new Laws, made upon new emergent occasions. See <hi>Antonius Contius</hi> his Preface to the <hi>Novels.</hi> So sorry an Image is this of the former <hi>Roman</hi> Polity.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Whereas he says, That this <hi>Image</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted in the Pope's creating the <hi>German</hi> Emperours to be the Emperours of the <hi>Western</hi> Empire; I say, whether these Emperours or the Popes be conceived to be the eighth Head of the Beast, the seventh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing supposed, as the Remarker would have it, the <hi>Ostrogothian</hi> Kings, and the raising the living <hi>Image</hi> of the <hi>Beast</hi> the subjection of the <hi>Barbarians</hi> to the <hi>Roman Political</hi> Laws collected by <hi>Iustinian,</hi> it will follow, as I think I have elsewhere noted, that the Beast will be some hundred of years revived before his Head, than which, what can be more absurd in Reason and Philosophy?</p>
                     <p>And lastly, for the Pope's giving life to this Image of his making, it being onely a <hi>civil</hi> Image, as the Remarker would have it, and not reaching <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Ecclesiastick</hi> affairs, the Pope has not so little to doe as to inspire any life into it; but if this Image reach <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Ecclesiastick</hi> affairs, then the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marker <hi>contradicts</hi> himself. Thus I think I have suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently proved that the Remarker's sense of that Description [The Beast that was, is not, and yet is] is so far from being the <hi>plain</hi> sense, that it is <hi>grosly false,</hi> it being understood of the <hi>Civil Roman</hi> consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution onely; which all the time he speaks of, never ceased to be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Whence it could never be said pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:48067:88"/>
of it [it was] because that is of things past; nor [is not] because that is not true of things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent; nor [is not, and yet is] because that is non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sense applied to the same thing still in Being. So infinitely <hi>false</hi> is this conceit of the Remarker. But that it is also <hi>impertinent,</hi> I shall dispatch in one word. This gives us no instruction touching the <hi>State</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> as to the <hi>purity</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Worship,</hi> and therefore is <hi>useless,</hi> and <hi>impertinent,</hi> and uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliable with the main and general Scope of the <hi>Open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed-book-prophecy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vers.</hi> 12. <hi>Receive power as Kings one hour with the Beast, viz.</hi> not the <hi>two-horned,</hi> but <hi>ten-horned</hi> Beast headed with the <hi>eighth</hi> Head or <hi>two-horned</hi> Beast. For when the Empire, invaded by the Barbarous Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, setled again into a subjection or conformity to the <hi>Roman Laws,</hi> then did the Princes or Christians of those several Nations become setled as Kings in the several Countries of the Empire where they were seated.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> The Ten-horned Beast contains the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire with its ten Kings. Wherefore if the <hi>Beast</hi> does not include <hi>Idolatry</hi> here in it, the sense will be, The <hi>ten Horns</hi> will receive power as Kings, when all the ten Kings of the Empire receive power as Kings; that is, They shall receive power when they shall receive power. What a trifling is this? But if we take <hi>Beast</hi> in its proper sense, according to the Prophetick style, it will naturally signifie as the Expositor has noted, That about that time that the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, which was <hi>Christian</hi> before, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to revive into the <hi>Image of the Dragon</hi> for <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition, Persecution</hi> and <hi>Idolatry,</hi> then shall the <hi>Ten Horns</hi> also be receiving their power as Kings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        <pb n="154" facs="tcp:48067:89"/>
This sense, as it is <hi>plain,</hi> so it is <hi>instructive,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliable with the general scope of the <hi>Opened-book-prophecy,</hi> that informs us of the State of <hi>Religion,</hi> and of the Worship of God and Christ in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian World. But what <hi>Iustinian</hi>'s Code has here to doe, I know not. <hi>Theodorick</hi> was appointed King of <hi>Italy</hi> by <hi>Zeno</hi> the Emperour before <hi>Iustinian</hi>'s time.</p>

                     <p>THE Description of this Angel does much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with that, <hi>chap.</hi> 10. The <hi>crying</hi> here <hi>mightily</hi> with a <hi>strong</hi> voice answering to the crying there with a <hi>loud</hi> voice, as when a <hi>Lion roareth,</hi> and the <hi>enlightening</hi> the Earth with his <hi>glory</hi> here, to the <hi>face</hi> of the Angel like the <hi>Sun</hi> there, yet they seem not to be the same. But this here seems to be the great Prince <hi>Michael,</hi> who, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. is said to stand up in the time of great trouble, such as never was since there was a Nation, and then the people of God should be delivered, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> That the Angel here described may <hi>reach into</hi> the times of <hi>Michael, Dan.</hi> 12. I will not deny. But then that is no bar to the sense the Expositor hath given. For by <hi>Michael,</hi> not <hi>Michael</hi> himself, but some illustrious Persons on Earth are understood. And when so many <hi>Illustrious</hi> Persons, <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi> appeared for the Truth at the partial Fall of <hi>Babylon</hi> or <hi>Rising of the Witnesses, viz.</hi> at the late <hi>Reformation,</hi> that partial fall may well be taken in to
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:48067:89"/>
this account. But the Times of <hi>Michael</hi> are after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and may respect the <hi>Kings</hi> of the <hi>East</hi> and the <hi>Conquests</hi> of the <hi>Rider</hi> of the <hi>white Horse</hi> with a sword coming out of his mouth. Which are the affairs of the sixth and seventh Vials.</p>

                        <hi>Vers.</hi> 2. <hi>Babylon</hi> is not said to become the Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Devils after its power is utterly destroy'd; but when the people of God are warned to come out of her, lest they partake of her plagues, so that her final destruction was to come. Which when it is come, her whole <hi>Politick</hi> body will then be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved, that then she will cease to be <hi>Babylon,</hi> nor will the people of God then need any admonition to come out of her when they can have no motives to stay in her. But she is said to be fallen here, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause she had lost the Authority with which she for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ruled in the world, and her game she had now to play was with all her force and Arts of Policy to defend her self against the great judgment coming upon her.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans. Babylon</hi> is undoubtedly said to be the Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Devils after she is utterly overthrown and brought to ruine, the haunting of <hi>Devils</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean Birds</hi> being the very character of such <hi>ruined</hi> places, and alluded to here. Nor are the people of God warned to come out of her ruines, but that voice out of Heaven to God's people, <hi>to come out of her,</hi> was uttered before the <hi>Rising of the Witnesses,</hi> and this Angel's strenuous proclaiming the fall of <hi>Babylon.</hi> This warning, I say, precedes both the partial and final overthrow of that great City. But the description of her desolation and ruines from their being haunted with Devils and unclean Birds, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects especially her final overthrow. Nor are the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:48067:90"/>
people of God bid to come out of her Ruines, as I noted before, but to come out of <hi>Babylon</hi> both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her <hi>partial</hi> and <hi>consummate</hi> fall. Here therefore is an <hi>Hysterology</hi> in the <hi>Cortex.</hi> But the descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of so complete an overthrow of <hi>Babylon</hi> does plainly shew us and assure us that the bidding to go out of her is before her fall. And therefore this voice <hi>from Heaven</hi> commanding God's people to <hi>come out of her,</hi> answers to the voice of the <hi>first</hi> of the <hi>three</hi> Angels, <hi>ch.</hi> 14. flying in the <hi>midst of Heaven,</hi> and exhorting men to fear God and to worship Him, that is, the Creator of all things, that is to say, to cease from <hi>Idolatry.</hi> The voice <hi>from Heaven</hi> here is coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident with the latter part of the time of the voice of the <hi>first</hi> Angel from the <hi>midst of Heaven.</hi> Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of such <hi>Hysterologies</hi> in the <hi>Cortex</hi> are so fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, that I need not name any.</p>

                        <hi>Vers.</hi> 3. There's no need of taking <hi>Merchants of the Earth</hi> in any other than the <hi>literal</hi> sense. But then it's not to be applied solely to the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> but to all other Cities under her Jurisdiction, which being of the same <hi>Political</hi> body, are comprehended under the name of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and by imitation of her delicacies and splendour became in like manner en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>richers of her Merchants.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> It is not likely the Spirit of Prophecy would spin out so long a <hi>Threnodia,</hi> if it was onely the <hi>howling</hi> of some <hi>secular Merchants,</hi> that their world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Traffick failed them. What's this to the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> which the <hi>Opened-book-prophecy</hi> has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways an eye to? And what a <hi>sapless</hi> thing is the <hi>literal</hi> sense of this <hi>lamentation</hi> in comparison of the <hi>Parabolical?</hi> And what Jurisdiction has <hi>Rome</hi> as a <hi>secular</hi> trading City over other <hi>trading</hi> Cities
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:48067:90"/>
of the Empire? The new <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> to which <hi>Babylon</hi> is directly opposed, does not signifie a <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial</hi> City, but a <hi>State</hi> or <hi>Polity,</hi> therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly <hi>Babylon</hi> signifies so too. And lastly, this City of <hi>Babylon</hi> is said to <hi>deceive</hi> all Nations by her <hi>Sorcery,</hi> and to be guilty of the <hi>bloud</hi> of <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Saints,</hi> &amp;c. Are <hi>secular</hi> Merchants such pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found <hi>Magicians,</hi> or so concerned to <hi>suck</hi> the bloud of <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Prophets?</hi> This therefore is an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much <hi>homespun</hi> and <hi>secular</hi> conceit in the Remarker to fansie the <hi>Parabolical</hi> sense needless of this lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>

                     <p>THE Doxology supposed to end <hi>here</hi> is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in the <hi>three following</hi> Verses, and the <hi>four first</hi> Verses seem to respect onely those who are called to the <hi>Marriage-supper,</hi> or appertain to the <hi>new Ierusalem,</hi> and the <hi>following three</hi> verses the <hi>joining all others</hi> with them in the Doxology, who are concerned in that great Revolution and blessed Renovation of the World, when the earnest expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Creature which waiteth for the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation of the Sons of God shall be answered, and thereby the Creature it self that had been so long subject to vanity, shall be delivered from the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of corruption, into the glorious liberty of the children of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.19, 20, 21. and there's no going back till verse the eleventh.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> The <hi>four first</hi> verses do plainly contain a <hi>Doxology,</hi> or the praising of God for his just <hi>judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> upon <hi>Babylon,</hi> as is plain from <hi>v.</hi> 2. where he is said to have <hi>judged the great Whore.</hi> This is the occasion and object that this <hi>Doxology</hi> is conversant about. And the occasion and object of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Doxology</hi> in the <hi>three next</hi> verses is the <hi>Marriage</hi> of the <hi>Lamb,</hi> as is plain <hi>v.</hi> 7. <hi>Let us be glad and give honour to him, for the Marriage of the Lamb is come,</hi> &amp;c. Wherefore they having <hi>distinct</hi> occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and objects, it is sufficient Reason they should be look't upon as <hi>distinct Doxologies,</hi> and that the former should not be conceived to be continued three verses farther than it is. Whence it follows, the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:48067:91"/>
                        <hi>Marriage</hi> of the <hi>Lamb,</hi> or Conversion of the Jews <hi>synchronizing</hi> with the <hi>sixth Vial,</hi> as the <hi>Battel</hi> of the <hi>Rider of the white Horse</hi> with the <hi>seventh,</hi> that the going back must be before, <hi>vers.</hi> 11. <hi>viz.</hi> at <hi>vers.</hi> 5.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vers.</hi> 12. The Crowns here signifie not the <hi>Kings</hi> of the East <hi>submitting</hi> themselves to the <hi>Rider</hi> of the <hi>white Horse.</hi> For those are Believers who are to reign with Christ, but wear no such Crowns as are here signified. For the Crowns here are of those Kings that war with the Lamb, but he shall over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and so he wears the Crowns which he had won.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> If there were an accession of many Kings to the Kingdom of Christ, whether they yielded <hi>vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily,</hi> or by <hi>force,</hi> there was an accession of so many Crowns <hi>ipso facto,</hi> and their <hi>Conviction</hi> by the <hi>power</hi> of the <hi>Gospel</hi> is the best kind of vanquishing in the Kingdom of Christ and his <hi>Militia.</hi>

                        <hi>Vers.</hi> 14. The Armies being cloathed in <hi>white linen,</hi> does well accord with understanding the war <hi>literally.</hi> For this cloathing does onely signifie that it's an holy war, being under the conduct of him who in righteousness doth make war.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans. White linen</hi> may signifie <hi>holiness,</hi> but by no means a <hi>carnal war.</hi> If that had been meant, it would have been said, they were cloathed in <hi>white</hi> armour, <hi>bright</hi> and <hi>shining.</hi> Which would aptly have signified both holiness and war too.</p>

Nor does the <hi>sword issuing out of his mouth,</hi> wherewith he smites the Nations, shew it to be no <hi>carnal</hi> or <hi>literal</hi> warfare, but signifies the sharp, but righteous <hi>sentence</hi> of judgment, which he does first pronounce against his enemies, and then does
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:48067:92"/>
the war execute the same. And also signifies farther, that <hi>spiritual slaughter</hi> or powerfull conviction of the Remnant, <hi>v.</hi> 21. <hi>Thou shalt rule them with a rod of Iron, and break them,</hi> &amp;c. does plainly signifie the absolute subjection he shall bring his obstinate ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies into, as the admonition in the following ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses thereto, in <hi>Psal.</hi> 2. does shew. To which does an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer in <hi>Psal.</hi> 110.2. <hi>God shall send the rod of thy strength out of Sion, rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.</hi> But <hi>contrition</hi> of heart by <hi>conviction,</hi> can with no aptness be signified by the said expressions of the Psalmist, it being a <hi>spiritual</hi> subjecting of men into a <hi>voluntary</hi> obedience, contrary to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>

For <hi>Sun</hi> does not signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Legislative power <hi>in abstracto,</hi> nor yet in <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creto,</hi> unless it be <hi>Monarchical,</hi> which is not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Hypothesis of the Remarker.

For this is the <hi>Philadelphian</hi> Army, which Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self calls <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

But these were some <hi>inspired</hi> Prophets of the <hi>Evangelical</hi> party, that from the sure word of Prophecy and their expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of the marvellous effects of the zealous preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the pure Gospel in the power of the spirit, foretell the success of the Battel in this Invitation, standing in the glorious <hi>light</hi> or <hi>Sun-shine</hi> of the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel.</hi> But to make the Angel that stands in the Sun to stand in the person of Christ, the Monarch or Head of his Kingdom, seems rude and incongruous. This confident Invitation answers to that voice from the <hi>Throne,</hi> from the <hi>Dabir</hi> or <hi>Oracle,</hi> ch. 16.17. <hi>It is done.</hi> Nor need the Remarker judge the <hi>referring</hi> this so glorious a description of this great battel and victory <hi>to the preaching</hi> of the Gospel an <hi>extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant</hi> conceit, as there being then little need of it,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:48067:94"/>
and the Enemy so obdurate against it. For there will be great need of such preaching of the Gospel, as we have described, and the power of it predicted, is not upon the <hi>Antichristian</hi> party, which the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marker fansies so obdurate, but upon the <hi>Infidel</hi> party <hi>especially,</hi> which are said to be <hi>slain with the sword of him that sate on the white Horse.</hi> But the <hi>Beast</hi> and the <hi>false Prophet</hi> are not so <hi>slain</hi>; and it is a wonderfull good and solid reason which the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positor intimates for it. Because the Fowls of the Air could not feed on them, they being cast into the Lake of fire. Nor could they feed on them before they were cast thither, as the Remarker imagines, because they were <hi>taken alive</hi> and cast into the Lake of fire; And Fowls that follow Armies do not seize on men before they be slain. Wherefore it is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration that the <hi>Beast</hi> and <hi>false Prophet</hi> were none of the <hi>slain</hi> by the sword that goes out of that <hi>Hero</hi>'s mouth on the white Horse.</p>

                        <hi>Ans.</hi> The nature of Prophecy is to tell us of the <hi>visible events</hi> of things in <hi>this life.</hi> And the event of the Battel, as to them that are said to be <hi>slain with the sword,</hi> concerns their visible state here on Earth; why should not then the event of the same battel, as it is figuratively or symbolically set out, concern the <hi>Beasts</hi> and <hi>false Prophets</hi> state in <hi>this world</hi> too? The being put therefore into the lake of fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, signifies not their being punished in Hell in the other world, but the consumption and abolition of their power in this. For by <hi>fire</hi> are things <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed.</hi> And it is said of the Whore, that some of the Kings should eat her flesh and <hi>burn her with fire.</hi> And it is the loftiness of the Prophetick style to parallel this consuming fire here, which denotes the full consumption and abolition of the power of the <hi>Beast</hi> and <hi>false Prophet,</hi> to the fire and sulphur of Hell. This is so plain and necessary a sense, that both <hi>Grotius</hi> and Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> embrace it, and make use of it on the place, though not to the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. That the inflamed zeal of the Conquerors a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the corrupt and idolatrous state of the <hi>Beast</hi> and <hi>false Prophet</hi> may contribute much to a speedier and perfecter dissolution thereof, is not unreasonable to imagine. But that a <hi>lake of fire</hi> and <hi>brimstone</hi> should signifie <hi>such zeal</hi> in men, I know no example in any Interpreter of Prophetick symbols. The other sense sufficeth. But that the great <hi>Hail-stones</hi> of a Talent weight denote the same thing that this <hi>fiery lake</hi> does here, therein I easily agree with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marker. Which does farther confirm that the Lake of fire signifies not the state of the <hi>Beast</hi> and <hi>false Prophet</hi> in the <hi>other</hi> world, but in <hi>this.</hi>

                        <hi>Ans.</hi> What is said in the beginning of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, supposes the <hi>Intervals</hi> of the <hi>seven Thunders</hi> to be equal; whenas they are very unequal, as the Intervals of the successions of the <hi>seven Churches,</hi> and of the <hi>seven Heads</hi> of the Beast are. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he says, that the <hi>Millennial</hi> State will be no <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi> Government, it is a plain contradiction to the language of the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> which by <hi>City</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands <hi>Polity</hi>; so that as the <hi>City Babylon</hi> is a <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, to which the <hi>City Ierusalem</hi> is the <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> or <hi>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite City</hi>; so there must be a <hi>Ierusalem-Polity</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite to the <hi>Polity of Babylon.</hi> Nor can there be any <hi>Polity</hi> understood without Order and Laws.
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:48067:97"/>
Nor is multitude of Laws any grievance of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if they be no more than do really serve for the security of the Government, the purity of God's worship, and the real good of the people: And in the <hi>Millennial</hi> Empire of Christ there will be no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Laws than such, nor any more than will serve those ends; and to bring things to <hi>that accuracy,</hi> will require longer time for discussing and sifting things, than a greater number of Laws would. But to say that the <hi>Millennial</hi> State will not be <hi>Political,</hi> but <hi>Spiritual,</hi> is to make an opposition betwixt those things which may very friendly agree. For a <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical</hi> State may be also <hi>Spiritual,</hi> as this <hi>Millennial</hi> State will be, the Laws being dictated in that great <hi>Oecumenical inspired</hi> Council, by the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> himself, and the <hi>Rulers</hi> in their respective places by virtue of their <hi>regenerate</hi> state, and the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> richly abiding in them, heartily relishing these Laws, and vigorously pursuing the execution of them. If this be not a <hi>Spiritual</hi> State, though <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical,</hi> what can be a <hi>Spiritual</hi> State or Government? What may seem to be wanting is, I fear, nothing but an unaccountable <hi>Huff,</hi> a <hi>Blast</hi> or <hi>Humour,</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Spirit of God. And as for the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of <hi>Humane</hi> Knowledge and <hi>Divine</hi> Illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in those times, as if that took away the use of <hi>Laws</hi>; I say, Laws are not for the <hi>just,</hi> but <hi>unjust,</hi> it is a Chain to bind the Devil and all that truckle un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him. For to think that in the <hi>Millennium</hi> there will be none, where the Saints live, but mere Saints is a rash conceit; There will be several odd fellows lurking in the Ruines both of the <hi>Dragon</hi>'s Kingdom and of <hi>Babylon.</hi> What follows is <hi>magnificent</hi> enough, but empty, and I have answered it already upon the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:48067:98"/>
foregoing Remark. And the latter part of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark does onely declare, not prove, there will be no declension in the <hi>Philadelphian</hi> State, whenas I have proved there will, by making good my Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Epistle to the Church of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> as also of the former Epistle, against the Exceptions of the Remarker. And it is a wonderfull groundless con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit to think that God would let loose Satan again out of his prison to disturb the affairs of his Church, and change the condition thereof, if they had not first changed their own condition, and merited this Judgment. And lastly, touching the Deceiver re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved out of the way; I ask what <hi>Deceiver</hi> caused the <hi>Angels</hi> to fall, before whose fall there were no Deceivers nor Devils? And the Devil when he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to his <hi>Infernal</hi> confinement, yet all that then can be said is but this, <hi>Let no man, when he is tempted, say, I am tempted of the Devil; for he,</hi> during his infernal confinement, <hi>tempteth no man: But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust and enticed,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Iam.</hi> 1.13. And certainly in the <hi>Millennium</hi> men are not born without Original sin, nor is their <hi>body of flesh</hi> less subject to various lusts than the <hi>Aethereal</hi> bodies of <hi>Angels</hi> were. So that what is here produced is mere Rhetorical colour, no solid or substantial Argument.</p>

This conceit of iron, adamantine, rigid Laws, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (and these to be in a time when there will be so little need of them) does shew an imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation much upon the rack. If the wicked in the <hi>Millennium</hi> are to be kept under such Laws, they will have little heart to join in that Song, <hi>Blessing, honour, glory and power,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>be unto him that sitteth on the throne, and unto the lamb for ever.</hi> Which is
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:48067:98"/>

But these will be times for which <hi>Paul</hi> says, <hi>The earnest expectation of the creature waiteth, and wherein it shall be delivered from the bondage of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God, it being not made subject unto vanity willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope,</hi> Rom. 8. <hi>viz.</hi> That wickendess which <hi>Iohn</hi> says the whole world lyes in, being the result of its thraldom and delusion under the power of the Devil, which lapsed man became subject unto; yet in hopes to be delivered therefrom, they becoming in this <hi>Millennial</hi> State partakers of their hopes, having all stumbling-blocks of iniquity taken away, and receiving all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages to further them in the ways of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, they will joyfully walk therein, and through the blessings they find do attend their so doing, will be moved to join in the said Song of, <hi>Blessing, honour, glory and power,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> Here's but the Repetition of the same things in the beginning of this Remark, which were in the former, and therefore they need no new Answer. But afterwards he offers at <hi>two new</hi> Arguments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst this conceit, as he calls it, of <hi>iron, adamantine, rigid Laws.</hi> For if there be such in the <hi>Millennium,</hi> the wicked will have little heart, says he, to join in that Song, <hi>chap.</hi> 5.13. <hi>Blessing, honour, glory and power,</hi> &amp;c. Whenas it is said, <hi>Every creature in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, Earth and under the Earth,</hi> &amp;c. shall join in it. In answer to which, I onely demand, Whether the <hi>old Serpent</hi> in his <hi>Infernal confinement,</hi> which is <hi>under</hi> the <hi>Earth,</hi> will either join in, or say <hi>Amen</hi> to that Doxology? In what sense he will, the wicked will also. The other Reason is, That this is the Time
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:48067:99"/>
                        <hi>(viz.</hi> the <hi>Millennium)</hi> wherein the <hi>Creature</hi> shall be <hi>delivered</hi> from the <hi>bondage of corruption, into the glorious liberty of the Sons of God.</hi> But I here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, first, Whether all the Creatures, or all men will be thus delivered from the bondage of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nay whether all men that live in the same Countries that they that belong to the new <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> do? I suppose the Remarker will not adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to assert it. Wherefore there being those among the Saints that are not Saints themselves, these rigid Laws are fit to bridle them. But then secondly, I deny that this place of <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. refers to the <hi>Millen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium,</hi> but to the state of the <hi>Resurrection.</hi> For then onely will this deliverance from the bondage of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption be, and the attainment of <hi>the freedom of the Sons of God,</hi> which is the <hi>Title</hi> of the <hi>Angels.</hi> For then in our <hi>glorified bodies</hi> we shall become <gap reason="foreign">

For there <hi>Saints</hi> cannot be said to reign, there being none there to be <hi>Subjects</hi> to them. And that State is not attainable till the Resurrection at the last day, when Christ hath promised to raise up those that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.28, 29. Also the following words; <hi>Blessed is he that hath part in the first Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, on such the second Death hath no power</hi>; do shew, that the <hi>first Resurrection</hi> is not an emerging above the Regions of Mortality, by being revivified into glorified bodies, for then the pronouncing the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:48067:99"/>
                        <hi>second death to have no power over them</hi> would be needless. Which is also farther evidenced by the reign in the <hi>first Resurrection,</hi> being a <hi>thousand years,</hi> whenas the <hi>Heavenly state</hi> is <hi>everlasting.</hi> And it's a great violation of Scripture to make a thousand years, when spoke of the Resurrection, to signifie <hi>Symbolically,</hi> when it's so oft in the Chapter used <hi>Numerically,</hi> and by coherence of the discourse must every-where needs have the same signification. Therefore the <hi>first Resurrection</hi> is a Privilege of the Martyrs that suffered under <hi>Antichrist</hi> to reign in the <hi>Millennial</hi> State, as the <hi>Powers of the Air, viz.</hi> the Devil and his Angels did among the <hi>worldly Powers,</hi> till he was bound in the bottomless pit.</p>
                     <p>

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, what will the Remarker say to that Text, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. <hi>If we suffer, we shall also reign with him.</hi> And to <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>Heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ, if so be we suffer with him, that we may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so glorified with him,</hi> that is, partake of his glorious Kingdom, according to that, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. <hi>Come ye bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of my father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you,</hi> &amp;c. Whence it is plain, that the Saints may be said to reign in Heaven according to phrase of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And if there be a <hi>Polity</hi> in Heaven, as most certainly there is, the <hi>Martyrs</hi> may have several Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces to rule over in a <hi>Briathick</hi> State, as the <hi>Cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balists</hi> seem to call it. And that the Heavenly State is not attainable before the general Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is against the opinion of the ancient Fathers, as you may see in Mr. <hi>Mede.</hi> And the <hi>last</hi> day reaches from the <hi>beginning</hi> of the <hi>Millennium,</hi> to the end of the World, or <hi>general Resurrection,</hi> as I have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed

this point more copiously in a Letter to a friend, and therefore am loth to repeat it here.</p>
                     <p>The adding to the mention of the <hi>first Resurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> that the <hi>second death has no power over them,</hi> is not needless, both because it more manifestly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports that this Resurrection is not meant of a <hi>Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Resurrection, but a <hi>Physical,</hi> and also that it as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures us of the sense of that passage in the Epistle to the Church of <hi>Smyrna; He that overcomes shall not be hurt by the second Death</hi>; from the comparing of which two places together, the Ancients rightly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred the Rising of the Martyrs at the <hi>first Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,</hi> that it was their privilege. So that as some of the passages in <hi>Daniel</hi> and the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> are, as it were, Tallies kept by parties one with another, to give a just account of the sense, so the same are some passages of the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> one to another, of which I might give many more examples, but I hold it needless.</p>
                     <p>Nor does the Martyrs reigning in Heaven that thousand years of the <hi>Millennium</hi> clash with their reigning there for ever afterwards. But from the beginning of the <hi>Millennium,</hi> to everlasting, is their reign, and <hi>Omne majus continet in se minus,</hi> so that it is true that they reigned in <hi>Heaven,</hi> while the <hi>Saints</hi> which worshipped not the Beast, with their successours, reigned in the <hi>Millennium</hi> on <hi>Earth, viz.</hi> they reigned a thousand years while the Martyrs reigned in Heaven the same time. But in this place it was impertinent, and too motiminous, nor sutable to the accustomed brevity and succinctness of the <hi>Apocalyptick</hi> style, to tell they yet farther reigned to all eternity, that being to be signified afterwards. Nor is it any violation of Scripture to make <gap reason="foreign">

Which therefore points at the determinate thousand years of the <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lennium.</hi> But it is lest out in the sixth verse, and, as it seems, on purpose to lead us to that <hi>symbolical</hi> meaning, touching those that partake of the <hi>first Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection,</hi> and which was proper to them, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdistinction to those Confessors who worshipped not the Image of the Beast, and who, with their suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors, <hi>onely</hi> reigned <hi>that</hi> thousand years of the <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lennium.</hi> Which farther argues, that the <hi>first Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi> is <hi>Physical,</hi> and into an Heavenly glorified body.

For then they have but the office of <hi>ministring</hi> Angels, which is not to <hi>reign,</hi> but to <hi>minister.</hi> For I hope <hi>they</hi> will not doe as the <hi>Devils</hi> did, receive religious worship from us mortals. And if these Martyrs have <hi>no bodies,</hi> how is it a <hi>Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection?</hi> and if onely <hi>Aerial</hi> bodies, so have other souls as well as they.

                        <hi>Ans.</hi> That there was no increase of wickedness by relaxation of discipline, is a thing said, not proved, though I have proved above to the contrary.

But this is a greater curiosity than needs. It is sufficient in the mean time to observe, that as the very people <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> that were the ancient Enemies of the Jews, are not here understood; so no people of a foreign Nation, out of the bounds and precincts of the <hi>New-Ierusalem</hi> Jurisdiction or Kingdom of Christ, are necessarily signified thereby, though I do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny but by <hi>Magog</hi> may be also understood, whatever foreign forces are accumulated to those that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Dominions of the <hi>new Ierusalem.</hi>

Nor is it any straining of the Text to make them called the <hi>Camp of the Saints,</hi> because there were <hi>many Saints</hi> there, though not <hi>all</hi> such, whenas the <hi>greater part,</hi> according to <hi>several degrees</hi> of <hi>Saintship,</hi> might be Saints, and these less degrees of <hi>Saintship</hi> an effect of the degeneracy, and that the <hi>external</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship in all was still pure and incorrupt, and they that used it did it out of judgment and conscience, being sincerely pleased, in that they thought God was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with it; this adds a farther weight to make the <hi>City</hi> both <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>beloved,</hi> especially in comparison of the rabble of their enemies. And therefore it was not <hi>Hypocrisie,</hi> but a solid ground that entitled this <hi>Camp</hi> to <hi>Saintship.</hi> And if we should suppose the most degenerate part to have listed themselves in the Army of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> as it is exceeding proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the <hi>Holy City</hi> seeming in such imminent danger;
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:48067:103"/>
this is manifestly consistent with the <hi>Camp</hi> being call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Camp of Saints,</hi> and the <hi>City</hi> the <hi>beloved City,</hi> and likewise with the degeneracy of those times, I mean the <hi>Laodicean</hi> degeneracy, at once; those de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate persons being now drained out of the <hi>Holy City</hi> into the Army of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> and so the <hi>City</hi> lest fit to retain the Title of <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>beloved</hi> still without any scruple or exception.</p>

And that this distinction of them is made by reason of the different state or degrees of punishment that befalls them after this life, according to that saying; <hi>The Lord soon pardoneth the mean, but the mighty shall be mightily tormented.</hi> This sense will well agree with <hi>v.</hi> 14. viz. <hi>Death and Hell were cast into the lake of fire,</hi> but so will not the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sense.

                     <p>
                        <hi>SEA</hi> does not signifie here the <hi>unquiet multitude</hi> of the wicked, but as it does in the <hi>second Trumpet</hi> and the <hi>second Vial, viz.</hi> The <hi>over-spread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of worldly Dominion</hi> that does overflow and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm men with power, as the Sea overflows the Earth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> The nature of the <hi>Sea</hi> is to be tossing, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet and moving, which therefore very well sets off the disposition of the <hi>Mobile vulgus,</hi> especially the <hi>wicked</hi> part of them, that are easily ruffled into seditions and rebellions. But when this <hi>new Heaven</hi> and <hi>new Earth,</hi> that is, this <hi>New-Ierusalem-Polity</hi> is settled, there will be no such thing as the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a fluctuating <hi>Sea,</hi> or of a <hi>Sea</hi> by invasion breaking in upon the Land; but all will be in <hi>set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled</hi> peace and quietness, as the Expositor has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained this passage. But to interpret Sea and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not of <hi>multitudes of people,</hi> but of <hi>worldly Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions</hi> (the ruling Part) is quite out of the road of the <hi>Prophetick</hi> style. But the <hi>worldly Powers</hi> and <hi>worldly Dominions</hi> hugely <hi>fill</hi> the Remarker's <hi>fancy.</hi>

                        <hi>Vers.</hi> 2. The <hi>New Ierusalem</hi> coming down from Heaven is not a <hi>Polity</hi> to be settled on Earth by <hi>Councils,</hi> but it is God's taking up his abode among men, to rule and govern them by his truth and life dwelling in them, whereby they shall walk in the <hi>light of life,</hi> and so not need the constitutions of <hi>Councils.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <pb n="184" facs="tcp:48067:105"/>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> The <hi>New Ierusalem</hi> come down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, is the <hi>new Heaven and the new Earth,</hi> and a new Heaven and a new Earth in the <hi>Prophetick</hi> style is a <hi>New Polity.</hi> See the <hi>Alphabet</hi> of <hi>Iconisms</hi> in [Heaven and Earth.] And besides, in that it is the <hi>City Ierusalem,</hi> in opposition to the <hi>City Babylon,</hi> it must be a <hi>Polity</hi> antistoechal to a <hi>Polity, City</hi> signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying a <hi>Polity</hi> in the <hi>Prophetick</hi> style. And a <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi> and <hi>Laws</hi> will be requisite, yea necessary in the <hi>Millennium</hi>; for there will be <hi>Draconists</hi> and <hi>Besti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> though under the Hatches, mingled within the Dominions of the Kingdom of Christ. And it is a childish conceit to think, that through so vast a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion as the <hi>Millennial</hi> will be, there will be none but such as are <hi>pure Saints,</hi> and have the <hi>truth of life</hi> dwelling in them. And however that be, men will not then be <hi>born</hi> Saints, but emerge into true Saintship by degrees, and therefore will need an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal direction. But the Remarker seems to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine they will be grown men as soon as they drop out of the womb, and will want no <hi>Childrens Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisms</hi> to instruct them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vers.</hi> 6. <hi>I will give to him that is a-thirst of the fountain of the water of life freely,</hi> does primarily respect the <hi>Millennial</hi> State, which is the present subject; and so likewise do the words in the next verse, <hi>viz. Shall inherit all things,</hi> yet <hi>eternal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> may be included in those <hi>promises.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> I say these places here mentioned do plainly point at the <hi>Heavenly Reward,</hi> as the Expositor has explained them, when Christ saves us to the utmost. His saying he is <hi>Omega</hi> as well as <hi>Alpha,</hi> intimates as much. For the last letter in the <hi>Alphabet</hi> of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is our <hi>enjoyment</hi> of the <hi>Heavenly Inheritance,</hi>
                        <pb n="185" facs="tcp:48067:105"/>
in which we inherit <hi>all things</hi> that heart can wish. And <hi>v.</hi> 7. as if he alluded to the conclusion of his Epistle to the Church of <hi>Laodicea</hi> (which farther confirms the Expositor's sense of that Epistle) he useth the phrase, <hi>He that overcometh,</hi> He shall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit all things, and I will be his God (he speaks there in reference to his Divinity) and he shall be <hi>my Son,</hi> and consequently <hi>an heir</hi> of the celestial In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance with Christ, enjoying such happiness as his glorified Humanity does there in the Kingdom of his Father.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vers.</hi> 13. The <hi>Inscription</hi> of the Names of the <hi>twelve Tribes</hi> on the Gates is but a continuance of that <hi>Israelism,</hi> which runs through the whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy. But if the imagined sense here were true, that there is no entrance into the dispensation of the spirit without endeavours to live up to the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal rules of the Word as well as one can, how come Publicans and Sinners to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven before the legal Scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> To make the distinct parts of the continued <hi>Israelism</hi> in this description of the <hi>New Ierusalem</hi> to signifie nothing, is to make the Spirit of Prophecy to <hi>trifle</hi> in the description thereof. Nor does this usefull and edifying sense the Expositor has given at all clash with that saying of our Saviour; That Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans and Sinners enter into the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven before the Scribes and Pharisees. For they did not live up to the external Law of God as near as they could, for then they had been <hi>sincere.</hi> But our Saviour Christ expresly calls them <hi>Hypocrites. Wo unto you Scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites, ye tithe, mint and cumin, but omit the weightier matters of the
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:48067:106"/>
law, judgment, mercy and faith.</hi> So that there was more sincerity in the <hi>Publicans</hi> and <hi>Sinners</hi> our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour pleads for than in <hi>them.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Vers.</hi> 15. The <hi>golden Reed</hi> here is to answer to all the rest of the splendid Description of the <hi>New Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi> but neither <hi>it</hi> nor the <hi>Angel</hi> measuring with it, signifies the <hi>Ierusalem</hi> state, to surpass those mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured, <hi>ch.</hi> 11. For it being (as is shewed there) the restauration of the <hi>outward Court</hi> to the <hi>inward,</hi> is not a superiour state to that of the <hi>Worshippers</hi> in the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Court.</hi> But the measuring there by a man, is by <hi>Iohn</hi> himself, to signifie his being to Prophesie of them, and what he does Prophesie of them respects chiefly their preservation from being troden down, and the duties they should perform. So that a <hi>gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Reed</hi> were not agreeable for that occasion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> This shuffling off this solid interpretation of the Angel's measuring the City with a golden Reed, depends upon the Remarker's making the <hi>Witnesses</hi> and the <hi>Worshippers in the Temple and Thysiasterion, ch.</hi> 11. to be the same, and the <hi>Inner</hi> and <hi>Outer</hi> Court to synchronize. But the vanity of this Imagination I have sufficiently confuted on that Chapter. And therefore measuring the <hi>Inner</hi> Court, signifying the symmetricalness of the Church visible for about 400 years after Christ, as not yet degenerated into that <hi>gross Apostasie,</hi> and there being different <hi>degrees</hi> of Holiness in the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum, Sanctum</hi> and <hi>Thysi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asterion,</hi> which also insinuates that that Interval of the Church did lessen in its Holiness by degrees, till at last it degenerated into that state of the <hi>Apostasie,</hi> and according to History those times having several things in them of a <hi>superfluous</hi> and <hi>combustible</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that will not abide the fire as Gold will, and
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:48067:106"/>
lose nothing of its weight, it is apparent that <hi>that</hi> state of the Church was <hi>inferiour</hi> to <hi>this</hi> of the <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lennium,</hi> and that being measured by an ordinary <hi>combustible</hi> Reed, and but by a <hi>man,</hi> for <hi>Iohn</hi> was such, this by an <hi>Angel</hi> and with a <hi>golden Reed,</hi> it does not onely admit but enforce upon the <hi>intelligent</hi> such an Interpretation as the Expositor has given, which is an edifying instructive Interpretation, when that account the Remarker gives signifies nothing, <hi>viz.</hi> onely, That the golden Reed here is to answer to the described splendour of the <hi>New Ierusalem.</hi> I demand then, What does that <hi>ordinary</hi> Reed answer to? Certainly to a more <hi>combustible</hi> and <hi>inferiour</hi> condition of the <hi>Inner</hi> Court, or the Worshippers therein, <hi>viz.</hi> the Church for about 400 years after Christ. <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where tells us. The City therefore being measured by a <hi>golden Reed,</hi> and by an <hi>Angel,</hi> is not said so for pomp sake, or merely <hi>to follow suit,</hi> as at a game at Cards, but by an <hi>antistoechal</hi> Reflexion on the <hi>Reed</hi> and the <hi>man</hi> measuring the <hi>Inner</hi> Court, <hi>ch.</hi> 11. to denote the excellent State of the <hi>Millennial</hi> Church above that of the Church till about 400 years after Christ, though that was an <hi>excellent</hi> state of the Church too in comparison of the times of <hi>Apostasie.</hi> This is more than enough on this Remark; that which I have wrote on <hi>ch.</hi> 11. does alone abundantly demonstrate the weakness thereof.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vers.</hi> 18. The <hi>City</hi> being of <hi>pure gold</hi> does signifie the <hi>sound judgment</hi> and righteousness that will dwell therein by the Throne of God and the Lamb being in it. Which to be sure will not be without <hi>charity</hi>; but the description does respect a <hi>spiritual</hi> state of Government.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="188" facs="tcp:48067:107"/>
                        <hi>Ans. Sound judgment</hi> and <hi>righteousness</hi> necessarily arise from the Spirit of <hi>Divine love</hi> or <hi>charity. Vnself-interessed Love</hi> must needs clear the sight in judgment. But the Remarker is shy of admitting <hi>Charity</hi> primarily to be understood, because it sutes so well with making the <hi>Millennium</hi> the same with the <hi>Philadelphian</hi> Interval after the settlement of things, which he has taken a toy against, though it be most certainly true.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vers.</hi> 19, 20. The <hi>twelve stones,</hi> which are the foundation of the Wall, need not each of them a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular signification here, but as all pretious stones, are chiefly valued according to their degrees of <hi>splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour</hi> and <hi>solidity</hi>; so these two qualities seem main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly here to be aimed at, to signifie the soundness and beautifulness of that <hi>Apostolical</hi> Righteousness where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the safety and defence of the <hi>New Ierusalem</hi> shall be founded; yet not excluding an allusion to such qualities in any of the stones as will bear an apt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication. But straining here to give a particular account of them all, hath caused a strange luxuriancy of fancy.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> To <hi>slubber over</hi> the Mystery of the <hi>twelve stones,</hi> with those two significations onely in general of <hi>splendour</hi> and <hi>solidity,</hi> is again to make the Spirit of Prophecy to <hi>trifle.</hi> And being thus niggardly as to admit of but two properties, it is still worse, in that one is less proper for a Wall, which is a struc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for <hi>defence,</hi> rather than for <hi>beauty</hi> and <hi>ornament.</hi> But take them both in; if this were the business, <hi>one kind</hi> of stone would have served better than all twelve, and that is the <hi>Diamond,</hi> which out-does them all for <hi>solidity</hi> and <hi>splendour.</hi> What stone so hard and invincible as it? What stone so beautifull
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:48067:107"/>
and splendid? But yet in a better mood he seems inclined to admit of an allusion to such qualities in any of the stones as will bear an apt application. But if in <hi>any,</hi> why not in <hi>all?</hi> He saith straining here to give a particular account of all hath caused a strange <hi>luxuriancy</hi> of fancy. But how can that fancy be <hi>luxuriant</hi> that is not <hi>exorbitant,</hi> but keeps within a prescribed compass, and takes notice of no virtues in any of these stones, but what tend to the <hi>safety</hi> and <hi>security</hi> of the City, to preserve the <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphian</hi> State therein, and hinder it from lapsing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Laodicean.</hi> But that is the very thing that the Remarker has a pique at the presumption of the Expositor, for, that he would give an account of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very stone in the Wall, they several of them suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, and so aptly complying with his Hypothesis of making the <hi>Philadelphian</hi> state and <hi>New Ierusalem</hi> state all one, and the <hi>Laodicean</hi> to succeed; so that he cannot endure it, and upon that account calls that strained <hi>fancy</hi> in the Expositor, which is <hi>strickt</hi> and unexceptionable <hi>Reason,</hi> as any one that examines it without prejudice will find it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vers.</hi> 23. Christ's Kingdom being <hi>Spiritual,</hi> the Kings or Rulers there will rule by a <hi>Spiritual</hi> Power, by which they will be also <hi>Priests</hi>; such as the <hi>twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty four Elders</hi> are to the <hi>four Beasts,</hi> and such as <hi>they</hi> and the <hi>four Beasts,</hi> to those they shall reign over. And therefore to suppose, as here is done, that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs or crowned Heads (who rule by <hi>worldly</hi> power) shall be Kings or Rulers in Christ's King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, shews little understanding of the state of it, or something worse. Of that Lordship which the Kings of the Gentiles exercise, and of their being called Benefactors, our Saviour says, <hi>It shall not be
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:48067:108"/>
so among you, but he that is chief as he that serveth,</hi> Luk. 22.25. And their profession of Christianity, while they rule by the same <hi>Worldly</hi> and <hi>Political</hi> Government, cannot make them <hi>Christian,</hi> but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the more <hi>complete Antichristian</hi> Rulers. But the Autority that those <hi>Spiritual Kings</hi> and <hi>Priests</hi> will have in the <hi>Millennial</hi> State over those they go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern, may be likened to that Rule and sway which the <hi>Nobility, Gentry</hi> and <hi>Clergy</hi> have over the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalty,</hi> saving the great difference that, whereas the one is gained by <hi>worldly</hi> means, and managed for <hi>worldly</hi> interest, to the much grievance and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of the people, the autority of the other will be exercised with a <hi>true Christian spirit,</hi> to the full satisfaction and joy of those who are governed, and so will cause the fulfilling of what was told at our Saviour's Birth, of <hi>great joy and gladness that should be to all people,</hi> and of that Doxology (<hi>ch.</hi> 5.13.) of every Creature in Heaven and on Earth, <hi>Blessing, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, glory and power,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                        <hi>Ans.</hi> This is one of the <hi>oddest</hi> Remarks of the whole pack. We will therefore consider each pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage therein more strictly. Christ's Kingdom being <hi>spiritual,</hi> says the Remarker, the <hi>Kings</hi> or <hi>Rulers</hi> there will rule by a <hi>spiritual power,</hi> by which they will be also <hi>Priests.</hi> Here we are first to consider in what regard the Kingdom of Christ upon Earth may be called <hi>spiritual,</hi> in such sort as to be <hi>incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent</hi> with its being a Kingdom <hi>Political,</hi> which is settled by <hi>Councils,</hi> and ordered by <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees.</hi> For certainly the Kingdom of Christ was a <hi>spiritual</hi> Kingdom from the Apostles times, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, at least till the Christian Religion became the Religion of the Empire, and yet the affairs of the
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:48067:108"/>
Church were regulated by <hi>Laws,</hi> and established by <hi>Councils.</hi> There was at least twenty Councils be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Constantine</hi>'s time; So that the Church was both a <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Political</hi> Kingdom of Christ at once.</p>
                     <p>In what regard therefore was it <hi>spiritual?</hi> It was <hi>spiritual,</hi> first, in regard of its Erection, which was not by an arme of flesh or worldly forces, as other Kingdoms ordinarily are raised, but by the Spirit of God in powerfull preaching of the Gospel, and in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Miracles.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, It is an <hi>holy spiritual</hi> Kingdom, <hi>anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoechal</hi> to the Kingdom of <hi>evil spirits,</hi> against which this Kingdom of Christ was erected, to rescue us from their Temptations, and the thraldom of sin and wickedness under them: And St. <hi>Paul</hi> declares, Ephes. 6.12. <hi>That we wrestle not against flesh and bloud</hi> (as if we had any carnal or worldly design of wrestling the dominion of the World into our own hands, that we might enjoy the World) <hi>but against Principalities, against Powers, <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, which often signifies no more than the air. And <hi>Drusius</hi> on the place, cites one of the Commentators on <hi>Liber Aboth,</hi> who tells us, <hi>A terra usque ad firmamentum omnia plena esse turmis &amp; praefectis, &amp; infra plurimas esse creaturas laedentes &amp; accusantes omnésque stare ac volare in Aere, &amp;c.</hi> Which shews plainly that <hi>Drusius</hi> is of the same mind with <hi>Grotius.</hi> In this sense therefore is the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:48067:109"/>
Kingdom of Christ a <hi>Spiritual</hi> Kingdom, in that by the working of the <hi>Spirit</hi> in his servants it wrestles with, opposes and finally overcomes the Kingdom of <hi>evil spirits,</hi> tempters to all manner of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and debauchery, under which the Souls of men were enslaved.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly and lastly, The Kingdom of Christ is a <hi>Spiritual</hi> Kingdom, because the proper aim and scope thereof is merely <hi>spiritual, viz.</hi> the end and aim of it is not <hi>worldly</hi> and <hi>temporal</hi> things, but things <hi>spiritual</hi> and <hi>eternal.</hi> The <hi>Polity, Laws,</hi> and administration thereof by those that have the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> tend to this scope, that all the Subjects there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of may advance in the state of <hi>Regeneration</hi> by the power and working of the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> in them here, that they may be Heirs of that <hi>Heavenly, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible, spiritual</hi> and <hi>eternal</hi> Kingdom in the world to come. Whatever more than this, is imagined of the <hi>spirituality</hi> of Christ's Kingdom will end, I fear, in blind <hi>Enthusiastick Huffs</hi> and sudden <hi>Blasts,</hi> that will tear all into Anarchy.</p>
                     <p>But we proceed: Christ's Kingdom being <hi>spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,</hi> says he, the <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Rulers</hi> there will rule by a <hi>spiritual power.</hi> Why? so they will, though it be such a <hi>Polity</hi> as I have described, the Governours being endued with the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> and acting for the abovesaid <hi>spiritual ends,</hi> and being autorized so to act by the <hi>Laws of Christ's Kingdom,</hi> which their inward frame of spirit heartily closeth with, and assures them of the truth and equity of them, as also all the people of the <hi>New Ierusalem,</hi> who will be found willing to subject themselves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to in this day of Christ's power. Is not this plainly and fully to act and rule by a <hi>spiritual</hi>
                        <pb n="193" facs="tcp:48067:109"/>
power? Nor does this ruling thus by a <hi>spiritual</hi> power presently make them <hi>Priests</hi> properly so called. Christ is our <hi>King</hi> as well as our <hi>Priest.</hi> And so there may be as well <hi>Spiritual Kings</hi> in his <hi>Millennial</hi> Empire, as <hi>Priests</hi> according to the sense above declared, they ruling and reigning in the same <hi>Christian spirit,</hi> and for the same <hi>Spiritual ends</hi> that the <hi>Priests</hi> officiate for.</p>
                     <p>But to illustrate his meaning how they will be <hi>Priests,</hi> he farther adds, That they will be such as the <hi>twenty four Elders</hi> are to the <hi>four Beasts,</hi> and such as <hi>they</hi> and the <hi>four Beasts</hi> will be to those they shall reign over. But there is so much light in the Illustration, that it discovers the darkness of his own errour. For the description of the <hi>twenty four El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> is this, <hi>chap.</hi> 4. That there were <hi>twenty four [<gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>] Thrones,</hi> and on these Thrones <hi>twenty four Elders</hi> in <hi>white raiment,</hi> and there were <hi>golden Crowns</hi> on their Heads. What can be more expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive of <hi>Kings,</hi> than <hi>Thrones</hi> and <hi>golden Crowns,</hi> and of <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>righteous</hi> Kings, than the <hi>white raiment</hi> they are cloathed with? Which in all likelihood is <hi>white silk,</hi> which is called soft raiment in <hi>Matthew,</hi> and said to be fit for <hi>Kings houses.</hi> But that it is left indifferent, it is the more capable of having some allusion to the Priesthood likewise, but then with a complication of <hi>Holiness</hi> in these <hi>Millennial</hi> Kings, that they had the <hi>power of Kings,</hi> and the <hi>holiness of Priests,</hi> and were <hi>supreme Heads of the Church</hi> in <hi>Ecclesiastick</hi> causes also, in their own do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions. For the <hi>Kings</hi> in these times will not be so blind as to be led by the nose by the <hi>Priests,</hi> but see what is fitting themselves, and accordingly approve of it, and the <hi>Priests</hi> will easily appeal to
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:48067:110"/>
them, they themselves being faithfull also to the true end of Christ's Kingdom. If these <hi>Kings</hi> were <hi>Priests</hi> properly so called, or Kings properly so called were not here meant instead of <hi>golden Crowns</hi> on their <hi>Heads,</hi> they would have had golden Girdles girding their white raiment. Wherefore it is plain that the <hi>twenty four Elders</hi> are <hi>properly Kings</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the <hi>four Beasts.</hi> But they are <hi>Kings onely</hi> over the <hi>four Beasts,</hi> the four Beasts comprizing the whole <hi>Israel</hi> of God, that is, the whole Kingdom of Christ in the <hi>Millennium.</hi> And therefore the <hi>four Beasts</hi> are <hi>Subjects,</hi> nor are they <hi>Kings</hi> or <hi>Rulers</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver other people or Nations out of the Kingdom of Christ, which is rashly and without ground asserted by the Remarker.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore the Remarker vainly insults over the Expositor in the following words: <hi>And therefore to suppose, as here is done, that Monarchs or crowned Heads (who rule by worldly power) shall be Kings and Rulers,</hi> &amp;c. This is to fly in the face of the very Text, and pull the golden Crowns off the Heads of the four and twenty Elders. For they are <hi>crowned Heads,</hi> and reign and rule in Christ's Kingdom. But that he may seem to have some wit in his wrath, he would by <hi>crowned Heads</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand such Monarchs as rule by <hi>worldly power.</hi> But I have already demonstrated, that the <hi>Monarchs</hi> in the <hi>Millennial Polity</hi> rule by a <hi>Spiritual</hi> power, and that a <hi>Political</hi> and <hi>Spiritual</hi> Government are not terms inconsistent one with another, nor need I again repeat it. Whence it is manifest, that the Remarker out of the ignorance of the state of Christ's Kingdom or something worse, an affected singularity in high-flown Notions, has erred in so material a point.</p>

'Tis this our Saviour blames, if any thing here in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, not <hi>Monarchy it self</hi> merely as <hi>Political.</hi> But mainly he spoke this to upbraid the ignorance of those of his disciples that were ambitious of high places in his Kingdom here on Earth, they foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conceiting they should have the pleasure and riches (whereby they may be inabled to be graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Benefactors) and splendour of worldly Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates. This concerns the Apostles themselves and the succeeding Bishops, which were to be Rulers of the Church (and therefore is rather a prediction for them than any Prescription to secular Christian Monarchs that should be afterwards) the Apostles, I say, this seems onely to concern, and the succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Primitive Bishops, who were to live in mean rank as to the condition of the world, and to care and toil for the good of the Church, and bear the brunt of all Persecutions, as our Saviour himself dyed for his Church. This is the genuine sense of those two places. But for such a <hi>Monarch</hi> as really rules for the good of the Kingdom of Christ, that
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:48067:111"/>
those places any thing concern such a <hi>Political Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> is a wonderfull groundless conceit, and quite out of the Road of Truth. As that which follows, is either grosly false or impertinent. For if he mean that <hi>Political</hi> Government simply in it self, will make a <hi>Christian</hi> Ruler, or a Ruler that professes Christianity rather the more completely <hi>Antichristian,</hi> it is wretchedly false, as may appear out of what has been said already. But if he mean by <hi>Political</hi> Government, <hi>Worldly</hi> Government, which serves the <hi>ends of the World,</hi> rather than of the Kingdom of Christ; this is absolutely <hi>imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent</hi> to the present point, and contrary to the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis, which is that these <hi>Millennial</hi> Monarchs rule by such a <hi>Political</hi> Constitution as best serves the promotion and conservation of Christ's <hi>Spiritual</hi> Kingdom, and best sutes with the Regenerate spirits both of the <hi>Governours</hi> and <hi>Governed.</hi> Which he keeping to, though himself were unregenerate, yet is he far from being <hi>Antichristian</hi>; but as it's said in lower matters, <hi>Malus homo,</hi> yet <hi>Bonus Civis,</hi> so such an unregenerate man would be a good <hi>Christian Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch,</hi> not at all <hi>Antichristian.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A man would think that the Remarker were a <hi>Republican</hi> or <hi>Antimonarchical</hi> man by such wild passages as these. But what follows may clear him from that suspicion. For he likens the Autority that those <hi>Spiritual</hi> Kings and Priests will have in the <hi>Millennial</hi> State over those they govern to that Rule and sway which the <hi>Nobility, Gentry</hi> and <hi>Clergy</hi> have over the <hi>Commonalty,</hi> &amp;c. Which if it relates to the English Constitution, he must needs understand of the Time <hi>out of Parliament,</hi> because <hi>Convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Councils</hi> and <hi>Parliaments</hi> are of a <hi>Political</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:48067:111"/>
which he will not allow of in the <hi>Millennium.</hi> From whence it is manifest, that the Rule of those <hi>Spiritual</hi> Kings and <hi>Priests</hi> in the <hi>Millennium</hi> over them they govern, is merely <hi>precarious,</hi> and they may chuse whether they will obey them or no. And so this <hi>deep mystery</hi> of the Remarker, touching the <hi>Millennial</hi> State, is resolved at last into mere <hi>Anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy.</hi> Though I will be so charitable as to hope he will allow <hi>Monarchy</hi> to be the best Government till that time, (which is far enough off) that the <hi>Millen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial</hi> Anarchy comes in.</p>
                     <p>This is an extravagant dream, arising out of a <hi>dry</hi> and <hi>over-thoughtfull Melancholy,</hi> thus to fansie the <hi>Millennial</hi> State here on Earth to be <hi>Aziluthical,</hi> or like <hi>Ovid</hi>'s golden Age, when there was neither <hi>Law</hi> nor <hi>Magistrate,</hi> whenas I have above noted, that even the unfallen Angels, and that before the lapse of any, were in a state <hi>Briathical</hi> or <hi>Political</hi> in the Heavenly Regions. And lastly, as for the Joy and Doxology he concludes with, no intelligent good man but would be more thankfull to Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, for such a tight and well-knit <hi>Polity</hi> in the <hi>Millennial</hi> Kingdom of Christ, as I have described, than such a lax and lazy <hi>Anarchy</hi> as is described by the Remarker.</p>

And therefore <hi>Adam</hi> was not disposed to eat of the <hi>Tree of life,</hi> being not forbidden, though he was so forward to eat of the <hi>Tree</hi> that was <hi>forbid</hi>; which after he had done, he was expelled Paradise, lest he should then take of the <hi>Tree of life</hi>; whereby is sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, that <hi>enterance into life</hi> is not to be gained by <hi>following</hi> our <hi>own inventions,</hi> in searching after the <hi>knowledge of good and evil.</hi> But if this <hi>Tree of life</hi> be taken (as it is here) to signifie <hi>Men,</hi> it must not be to signifie <hi>Grandees</hi> onely, but <hi>all Citizens,</hi> viz. all Plants of Righteousness nourished by the Waters of life. The <hi>leaves healing the Nations</hi> does not mean those that were become <hi>Subjects</hi> to Christ's Kingdom and Discipline, but <hi>neighbouring</hi> Nations, whose

Kings brought their honour and glory to the new <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem.</hi> And that <hi>light of Instruction</hi> they borrowed from the glorious lustre of it (in the light whereof the Nations which are saved shall walk) is signified by the <hi>leaves of the tree of life healing the Nations.</hi> In like manner did other Nations borrow light from the <hi>Iudaical</hi> Worship, and the <hi>Heathen Priests</hi> and <hi>Philosophers</hi> did rectifie their Theology by the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi> doctrine. And though this healing of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by the leaves will be much more verified in the people subject to the Dominion of the <hi>New Ierusalem,</hi> than in those neighbouring Nations, yet that verify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, is signified by the description given of <hi>his</hi> righteous Dominion, who is to judge the World in Righteousness, and minister Judgment to the people with Equity.</p>

But it is a childish conceit to think that in the <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lennium</hi> external Nature will be changed, though men will then have more healthfull bodies, by reason of their <hi>Regeneration</hi> into <hi>true</hi> Holiness and Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. The judgment of <hi>R.

Let not such a fond conceit arise in thy mind, as if in the days of the <hi>Messias</hi> any thing would vary from the usual custome of this natural World, or any thing be innovated in the work of the six days Creation. But the course of Nature will then be no otherwise than now it is. See <hi>Munster,</hi> on <hi>Esay,</hi> ch. 11. whose expressions touching the times of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> v. 6, 7, 8. that Wolves, Lions, Bears and Leopards will then lose their salvageness, gave some Jews occasion to deny, that the Times of the <hi>Messiah</hi> are yet, because these Beasts still retain their old nature. Which shews the danger of extravagant interpretations of Prophecy; To set the sense of things upon such a strange rack, and incredible, that they that shall believe it will be hindred from acknowledging Prophecies to be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, when yet really they are. And therefore, as <hi>ch.</hi> 21.4. where it is said, <hi>And there shall be no more death</hi>; the meaning is not, that the Citizens of the <hi>New Ierusalem</hi> shall never dye; but there shall be no such death as in the <hi>Polity</hi> of <hi>Babylon,</hi> no more bloudy massacrings of the faithfull witnesses of Christ; so likewise here, <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>THIS Image being to represent the four great Kingdoms that were to arise successively on the Earth, and which is said to be <hi>terrible</hi> in the same sense, as the four Beasts in the next Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion are called <gap reason="foreign">

by this Image, and also all Heathen Monarchs had it absolutely in themselves) which <hi>States</hi> are signified by the <hi>Clay,</hi> answering to the Beast that wore the ten Horns, and the Ecclesiastick power is no farther concerned therein, than as it is a part of the States.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> Though we should suppose this Image to be said in the same sense <hi>terrible,</hi> that the four Beasts in the next Vision are called <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, or <hi>wild</hi> Beasts, yet it is not incongruous to understand part of it to concern other than <hi>secular</hi> power. Nay, it being to represent the same four great Kingdoms that the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Vision does, and to the same extent of time, it had been an hideous defect, if there had not been something in this to answer to the <hi>little Horn with eyes</hi> in the other, that being a Principal Object of Divine Providence and of the Prophecy: But the little Horn with eyes is the <hi>Ecclesiastick</hi> Power in the fourth Kingdom, when it was divided into ten Horns. And the very Title of this Power is <hi>Reverend,</hi> which is something a-kin to <hi>Terrible.</hi> For what we do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere, does, in some sense, cause fear in us. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides this, this <hi>Ecclesiastick</hi> Power is, in the Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lypse, called <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, a <hi>wild</hi> Beast, with two Horns, which every wild Beast has not. And if it be the less frightfull, because they are said to be the Horns of a Lamb, yet the Beast is still sufficiently <hi>terrible,</hi> in that it hath the voice of a Dragon. But this Lamb-like condition of it is chiefly represented in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Vision, its seeming harmlesness and unarmed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, its suppleness and compliableness to cleave to that which is stronger; as in moist Potters-clay —<hi>Argillâ quidvis imitaberis udâ.</hi> Whence it is plain, there is no need of this new conceit of the
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:48067:118"/>
Remarker, that would confine this <hi>mixture</hi> of <hi>Iron</hi> and <hi>Clay</hi> to a mere <hi>secular mixt</hi> Monarchy. But the Clay is the same power here (but under such a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as I have intimated) that the little Horn with eyes is in the ensuing Vision; and yet haply with this difference, that this white <hi>Clay</hi> or <hi>Potters-Earth</hi> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies the <hi>Ecclesiastick</hi> body in <hi>general,</hi> as they are opposed to the <hi>Laicks</hi>; the other the same, more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly moulded into an Hierarchy: And so it may be the more fitly conceived, why the <hi>two-horned</hi> Beast is said to rise out of the <hi>Earth,</hi> namely out of this <hi>Clayey-Earth</hi> or <hi>Potters-Earth.</hi> But if a mere <hi>mixt Secular</hi> Monarchy were understood thereby, that being so congenerous a body, they all being Sword-men, <hi>Steel</hi> and <hi>Iron</hi> had been more fit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present their difference, than Iron and Clay, which, as the little Horn is said to be <hi>different</hi> from all the rest; so this Clay palpably at the first sight, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving notice, is presently discerned to be vastly <hi>different</hi> from the <hi>Iron.</hi> And the Remarker himself acknowledging the Ecclesiastick power to be part of the States in this mixt Monarchy, as he imagines, and the Vision making these two differences onely, he must have a wonderfull dim and undiscerning fancy that does not forthwith descry, that the <hi>Secular</hi> part of the power is all, and onely understood by the <hi>Iron,</hi> and the <hi>Ecclesiastick</hi> onely, by the <hi>Clay</hi>; as in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Vision the <hi>Secular</hi> part onely is understood by the <hi>ten Horns,</hi> the <hi>Ecclesiastick</hi> onely by the <hi>little Horn with eyes.</hi> Nothing is more clear to an unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced judgment than this.</p>

                        <pb n="210" facs="tcp:48067:119"/>
when the Power that became <hi>subject</hi> to it is meant by the <hi>Iron.</hi> But the <hi>Iron</hi> does signifie a <hi>stronger</hi> Power that what is meant by the <hi>Clay,</hi> and therefore by reason of it the Kingdom is said to be partly strong (as retaining some of the strength of the former Iron Kingdom) and by reason of the <hi>Clay,</hi> partly broken, that is, part of its Power is divided from it, and transferred unto that part of the Government signified by the Clay. And thus have the Kings of the ten Kingdoms retained some of the strength of the Iron, <hi>viz.</hi> a Supreme Prerogative Power over the States, though they shared with them in the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislative Power.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> No question but the <hi>Iron</hi> doth signifie a stronger power, as to the arme of flesh, as it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, than the <hi>Clay</hi> does, it chiefly alluding to the Military Power and ordinary worldly forces which Kings and Princes raise to defend themselves and their Kingdoms with, of which their Nobles, Gentry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are part. But the <hi>Clay</hi> is not apt to signifie any such Power, and therefore is used on purpose that you may understand the <hi>Ecclesiastick</hi> part of the Empire thereby: Who having no such power themselves, but yet versed in all the Arts of Insinuation, and Envea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling of those in whom this <hi>Iron-Power</hi> was placed, got at last such an hank upon the Iron part of the Empire, (by pretending a power <hi>in ordine ad spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualia</hi>) as to compass such things as weakned both the power and security of the Monarchs of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; so that the Papal Hierarchy at last in Reality became the Head of the Empire. But this was not an <hi>Iron-power</hi> or <hi>Worldly-power,</hi> but a pretended <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual</hi> Power; which therefore the Spirit of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, in the Apocalypse, ever and anon compares to
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:48067:119"/>
                        <hi>Magick</hi> and <hi>Witchcraft.</hi> Whenas the visible Power of Arms is a plain solid thing, and bears the face of its own strength, and of what it is apparently before it. The <hi>ten Horns</hi> without <hi>eyes,</hi> giving up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be led by the <hi>little Horn</hi> with the <hi>eyes</hi> of a man, (who thereupon framed all matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to the Interest of his Hierarchy, and they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a <hi>Clayey</hi> conscience, that would comply and fit it self to any occasion that would advance their gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure) this was most certainly the weakening of the Power of the Monarchs. Nor can any Monarch be absolute, that in the mutable matters, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern Christian Religion, is not Supreme Head him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, but yields his neck to the yoke of a foreigner. The Competition is betwixt the ten <hi>sightless</hi> Horns, and the little <hi>seeing</hi> Horn. There's no other States taken notice of in that Vision, and no more there is in this. The mixture of Monarchy in a mere secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar sense, is not an Object worth the taking notice of by these Divine Prophecies, whose main scope is to foretell the State of the Church, not the condition of secular States as such.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vers.</hi> 43. Whereas the Act of mingling here is ascribed to the Iron, viz. <hi>It mixeth with the Clay,</hi> signifying the descending of those Kings from that height of Majesty and Power with which Heathen Kings and Emperours reigned, to the admitting of those signified by the <hi>Clay</hi> to some participation in the Government: the conceit here of <hi>Seminaries,</hi> &amp;c. does ascribe the <hi>Act</hi> of mingling chiefly to the <hi>Clay.</hi> And no better is the account of the words [They shall not cleave one to another] which are made here to signifie the bickering and clashing betwixt the <hi>Secular</hi> and <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> Power, whenas the
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:48067:120"/>
true sense of them is, That notwithstanding those Kings shall yield to the States sharing with them in Government, as aforesaid, yet they shall keep them at their distance, and retain the Majesty of Kings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>This change of the Power of Kings, from absolute to mixt Monarchy, was the result of Christianity's being established the Religion of the Empire.

But so power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full a check had the States (whereof the Clergy was a part) on Princes by virtue of Christian Laws, as oft to depose them for Male-administration. Which Autority some of the Princes did allow them to have, by virtue of the Episcopal Power, joined with them, as appears by that Speech of <hi>Carolus Calvus</hi> at the Council of <hi>Tullum, viz.</hi> From which my consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or sublimity of Kingdom, I ought not to be cast down or supplanted by any without the judgment of the Bishops, by whose Autority I was consecrated King, and who are called the Throne of God, in which he sitteth, and by whom he decreeth his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.

These were shrewd efficacious Instruments for the promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and continuing the adhesion of the Iron to the Clay, the Secular Power to the Sacerdotal Hierarchy of the Empire. And though <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>That against making the Iron and Clay their <hi>not cleaving</hi> to one another to import their <hi>falling out</hi> or <hi>clashing</hi> is a very sorry Cavil.

Where <hi>Illaudatus,</hi> does not signifie one that simply is not praised, but one that is detested and execrated of all for his barbarous cruelty. And there are infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Examples to the same purpose. But the <hi>Iron ever keeping</hi> the <hi>Clay</hi> at a <hi>distance,</hi> imports they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver mingled or cleaved together, which is plainly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Text. So that the Remarker had better have let things alone when they were so well ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justed
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:48067:121"/>
before, than have tampered so unskilfully with them; and upon grounds so conspicuously false, as if the Iron and Clay signified any other than two Orders of men, <hi>Secular</hi> and <hi>Ecclesiastick</hi>; He might as well say, <hi>Black</hi> and <hi>White</hi> would doe so.</p>
                     <p>What follows in this Remark, is big with a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble mistake. First, that the Defeat of the red Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon by <hi>Michael</hi> was an abatement of the Secular power of the Empire or Emperours, as if <hi>Constantine</hi> had less Secular power by becoming Christian: Whenas the overthrow of the red Dragon concerned onely the Pagan Religion; and what pitifull work the Remarker has made on that 12<hi>th</hi> Chapter of the Apocalypse, I have above shewn on his former Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks. The Emperour <hi>Constantine</hi> therefore remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as absolute a Prince as his Predecessors. Nor did he ever give away, (which is the other false surmise of the Remarker,) his Legislative power more than his Predecessors. But being miraculously converted to the Christian Religion, he did but that which the most absolute Princes that are, being in their Wits, would doe, for the good of the Empire, which was committed to him by God, without the due worship of whom, through Christ, he could not think the Empire could flourish. He therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted, especially with the Bishops, not to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate his Legislative power to them, but for them to communicate their skill in the Mysteries of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion to him, that he might order affairs accordingly. And if <hi>Constantine</hi> in virtue of the Christian doctrine, wherewith he was embued, ruled more righteously than his Predecessors, this was no abridgment of his absolute Power, but merely a right
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:48067:122"/>
use thereof. And the same may be said of the ten Kings or Monarchs, the ten Horns of the Beast. They were trepan'd out of their Right, when they acknowledged any Sovereign in causes Ecclesiastick as well as Civil, besides themselves. And I wonder, whenas the Remarker produces such a notable exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the case of <hi>Carolus Calvus</hi> of the Ecclesiastick encroachments upon the Secular Power, that he should at all doubt, but that the <hi>Clay</hi> is the <hi>Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick</hi> Power, as well as the <hi>Iron</hi> the <hi>Secular,</hi> and such a Power as alone is fitly set out by the <hi>Clay,</hi> in full distinction to the <hi>Iron</hi> or <hi>Secular</hi> Power in Kings, Nobles and Gentry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

And <hi>Paul,</hi> We have not received the Spirit of the World, but the Spirit of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And by reason of the rule of which in us, we are said to be of the World, and so under the power of darkness, in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to that Spiritual state which Believers are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten into, whereby they cease to be of the World, and are translated from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God, delivered from the power of darkness, and translated into the Kingdom of our Lord. This Spirit of the World therefore is the like Principle of the natural Life in man's heart, as the Spirit of God is of the spiritual Life therein; and by the one do the Devils bear the like sway in natural or unregenerate men, as Christ does by the other in the Regenerate. Hence is ascribed to the Devil that power over those who are delivered to him for the destruction of the flesh; and also the power of Death, through fear of which, he makes men all their life subject to bondage. And hence did he make that claim to all the Kingdoms of the World: which our Saviour did not gainsay. For he by the power men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned being the spirit that worketh in the children of disobedience, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2.2.

The four Winds striving on the great Sea, and four Beasts coming out of it signifie the four great Kingdoms that were to arise successively on the Earth,

and the great commotion and combustion they would cause in the World by their vanquishing one another. <hi rend="sup">d</hi> But the <hi>Aerial Genii,</hi> or <hi>Angels,</hi> are not concerned therein as Ministers of God's Providence farther than they are a part of the Powers of those Kingdoms that are so to arise.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> The Expositor does not say that <hi rend="sup">a</hi> 
                        <hi>Sea</hi> signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies multitudes of people simply, but that the <hi>great Sea,</hi> in <hi>this place,</hi> signifies so (according to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick style) which does not denote the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Dominion of any one Potentate, but the people of adverse Potentates, who are so far from being held under one Government, that they are the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of opposite Governments or Empires, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot be called one <hi>great Sea,</hi> as under one Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, but as one great Multitude, which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a <hi>great Sea,</hi> by reason of the greatness of the Multitude, and is well represented by the <hi>great Sea,</hi> with Winds ruffling the waves thereof, by reason of the Commotion and War one against another. <hi rend="sup">b</hi> But that a multitude under one Government is not called <hi>Sea,</hi> unless it be overflowing some other Government, I deny to appear either out of the second Trumpet or second Vial. The Remarker should have spoke out more clearly. But I say the Sea, though it be not actually overflowing another, being so subject to fluctuations from several cross Winds and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected occasions, is properly a Symbol of worldly Governments, that are obnoxious to these Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Mutations. Whence that passage, <hi>Revel.</hi> 21.1. is fitly understood. [And I saw a new Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and a new Earth] where Heaven signifies the
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:48067:123"/>
governing Part, and Earth the Multitude governed; which being expressed by <hi>Earth,</hi> there was no want of <hi>Sea</hi> to signifie the same; but to denote the stabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of this new constitution of things, it is added, [And there was no more Sea] which does not signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie there was no more multitudes, but no more tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuating multitudes, and that firm Peace and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity possest the <hi>Millennial</hi> Empire of Christ and his holy and righteous people. <hi>From whence come wars and fightings amongst you? come they not hence? even of your lusts that war in your members?</hi> Jam. 4.1. <hi rend="sup">c</hi> What follows in this Remark is something prolix and mysterious, but may be well meant for ought I know; but so far as I see, enervates nothing that the Expositor has writ on this verse. For the <hi>Spirit of the World,</hi> which he discourses of, certainly <hi>Ambition,</hi> which the Expositor names, is the chief effect of it, and most chiefly considered in this place. <hi rend="sup">d</hi> Nor does the Remarker deny but that the <hi>Aerial Genii</hi> are concerned in these Mutations and Revolutions in Kingdoms, which is all I care to have granted. This looks like a desire of saying something contrary to the <hi>Expositor,</hi> when there is nothing to be said.</p>
                     <p>But I cannot let pass one passage of Scripture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the many he has cited, <hi>viz.</hi> that, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 3.11. where he insinuates, that in [He hath set the World in their hearts] by [He] is understood the <hi>Spirit of the World</hi>; whenas it is plain from the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going words [He hath made every thing beautifull in its time] that it's <hi>God</hi> that has set the World in mens hearts, <hi>viz.</hi> in their understandings (For the Heart is the seat of the Understanding in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-phrase) in virtue of which they take more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice thereof than Brutes, but yet are far from being
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:48067:124"/>
Masters of the Mysteries of his Providence, as is intimated in the following words of that verse, That <hi>no man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is also another Scripture that he seems to intimate a false sense of, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.6. Where the Devil says the Disposing of all the Kingdoms of the Earth is given to him, and he bestows them on whom he will. Which the Remarker says, <hi>Christ does not gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say</hi>; insinuating thereby, as if his silence admitted it for truth. And indeed Christ himself, in St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> more than once calls the Devil <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>the Prince of this World.</hi> But that is onely to be understood in a <hi>Moral</hi> sense, not in a <hi>Political.</hi> For this <hi>Spirit of the World,</hi> of which the Remarker makes so many words, and which is the Image of the Devil in as many as it is, as the <hi>Divine life</hi> is the Image of God and Christ in us, nothing can more clearly, nor yet more succinctly describe it than what we find, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.16. <hi>All that is in the World, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life is not of the Father, but of the World</hi>; that is, of the <hi>Spirit of the World.</hi> And therefore he that is quit of these, and is transformed into the <hi>Divine life,</hi> which is the Image of God, is really <hi>translated</hi> out of the darkness of this World, <hi>into the Kingdom of his dear Son,</hi> as the Apostle speaks, and is a <hi>true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi>; he in the mean time adhering to the profession of the ancient Apostolick Faith, and holding com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the truly Catholick Church. Which others, while they pretend to doe, though they be plainly under an <hi>Antichristian Oeconomy,</hi> the <hi>Spirit of the World,</hi> according to St. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s description, reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in them, they are <hi>Morally</hi> reigned over by the
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:48067:124"/>
Devil, who obtains a wicked Tyranny over them, driving them to Tyrannize, or to be tyrannized o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, even in a <hi>Political</hi> sense. And thus, I confess, the Devil by his Instruments has a great sway over those that are of the World, in the sense above ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, and holds them in great slavery and bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, while the softness of the flesh, and abhorrence from death and hardship, and the covetousness of the eye, and the pride of life, ambitious Aspires makes them subject to be led captive at his will. In this sense our Saviour's calling the Devil the <hi>Prince of this World,</hi> is true. But the Devil's boast of being the Prince of this World, in his own sense, is as false as the other is true. And as for that power he has over the bodies of men, as to torturous diseases or death (in which respect he is called <hi>Samael</hi> by the Cabbalists) he looks there more like an Hang-man or Executioner than like a Prince. So that it is hard to conceive what the Remarker would have by his <hi>Spirit of the World,</hi> as to this place of <hi>Daniel,</hi> that may refer to the Winds blustering on the great Sea, more than the <hi>Expositor</hi> has offered already, in sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesting that they are either <hi>Angelical Powers,</hi> that bear a great stroke in all humane affairs, or the busie and unquiet Activity of <hi>ambitious</hi> minds especially, which St. <hi>Iohn</hi> calls the Pride of life, which does not exclude the other two Concomitants. But here has been too much said to such a needless Digres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>

The Eagle's wings being pluck't, is spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the whole Kingdom represented by this Beast, and therefore is not to be applied onely to the first King thereof, much less to that humbling Providence of driving him from his Kingdom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Whenas he

And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the plucking of the wings, by reason of it, ought to respect the one as well as the other. The being made <hi>to stand upon the feet like a man, and having a man's heart given it,</hi> are two expressions to the same purpose, and being (as I said of the plucking of the Eagle's wings) spoken of the Beast representing the whole Kingdom, are not to be applied onely to the first King, much less to that single Providence which befell him of his being restored from his delirancy. But they signifie, that though this Kingdom is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented by a <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

And also the noted Majestick splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of that Kingdom; of which speaks <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar,</hi> Dan. 4.36. <hi>And for the glory of my Kingdom, my honour and brightness returned unto me, and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:48067:125"/>
Majesty was added unto me,</hi> &amp;c. And hence it's not onely likened to the most noble generous spirited Beast, but also the same hath Eagles wings given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it; which though they signifie the haughty aspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring aforesaid (which is described, <hi>Esay</hi> 14.13, 14.) yet it's such as transcends the brutish nature, and must proceed from the spirit of a man. But to make the man's heart given to the Beast signifie <hi>Darius</hi> his humanity to <hi>Daniel,</hi> is a strange conceit. For if <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> was one of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Kings, yet what is spoken in general of the Beast, which signifies the whole Kingdom, cannot be appropriated to the last King, and he of so short a reign. But that the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonian</hi> Kingdom was finished in <hi>Belshazzar,</hi> appears by <hi>Daniel</hi>'s interpreting the hand-writing on the Wall, with which <hi>Ieremy</hi>'s Prophecy does agree, of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s Kingdom continuing to his Son, and his Son's son. And those who reckon the next Kingdom to begin in <hi>Cyrus,</hi> it's because <hi>Darius</hi> his reign was so short, as to be hardly taken notice of; and also, during his time, the Government was main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in <hi>Cyrus,</hi> though he bore the name of King.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> Most of this Remark would have been spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, if the Remarker had fully understood, or suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently considered the nature of a Prophetick <hi>Heno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poeia.</hi> For in such an <hi>Henopoetick</hi> Type, the Head or Horn of a Beast, together with the body thereof, make but one Beast to the end of the succession thereof. And therefore what the Beast in any part of its succession does, or suffers in any part thereof, it is said simply of the Beast to be done or suffered. And what by times or intervals is done by, or hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to such a <hi>Typical</hi> Creature, be it Man or Brute, is in the Prophetick Representation set out at once;
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:48067:126"/>
And History onely can discover how often, or in what part the Type is verified. I will give but one example for many. The Woman, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 17. sitting upon the Scarlet-coloured Beast, <hi>Iohn</hi> says, he <hi>saw her drunk with the bloud of the Saints, and with the bloud of the Martyrs of Iesus. Vidit eam ore rabido,</hi> saith <hi>Grotius, despumante &amp; evomente sanguinem, ut ebrii solent.</hi> But this was not the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant pickle she was in, and unintermitted, though it was seen and represented all at once to <hi>Iohn</hi>; But whether you understand it of <hi>Rome</hi>-Pagan with <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> there was not one-continued Persecution under the Pagan Emperours, but ten distinct ones, as they are reckoned. Nor under Paganochristian <hi>Rome</hi> has this glut of bloud been one continued Persecution, but Massacres at Intervals repeated, as also other Murtherings: But this being thus at several times drunk with the bloud of the innocent, is set out at once, as if it were but one fit of Drunkenness; or as if she were always drunk, neither of which is true. But the <hi>Henopoetick</hi> Type implies neither of those, but is onely a notable mark at large, and Prefigura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that at some times she would most barbarously persecute the Saints of God, and Martyrs of Jesus. This is all that this <hi>Henopoetick</hi> Type signifies.</p>
                     <p>And therefore it is great unskilfulness in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marker, that he will have the plucking of the Eagle-wings of the Lion to be done onely once, that is, when he is destroy'd, as they pluck Capon's wings not before their heads be writhen off. But by what has been said, these wings of the Lion may well be said to be pluck't, when any thing happened which might humble him, weaken him and discourage him, which certainly that sad Providence upon
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:48067:126"/>
                        <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> did, and could not but be a great Obstacle to the affairs of his Kingdom. The Retar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of which Affairs also happened again, and was notorious under <hi>Evelmerodac,</hi> when by the Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of <hi>Cyrus, Media</hi> was rent from the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Empire. And then again in <hi>Belshazzar,</hi> whose knees knocked together for fear, at the hand-writing on the Wall, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All these by virtue of a Prophetick <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopoeia,</hi> are referrible to that one passage of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy [I beheld till the wings thereof were pluck't] like as to the following words [And was made stand on the feet as a man, and a man's heart was given unto it] both the restoring of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> and the Humanity of <hi>Darius Medus,</hi> which the Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor has noted, are referrible also. And being the Text of the Prophecy places this reducing of the Eagle-wing'd Lion, upon the plucking of his wings, to a more humane Temper; it is evident, that the erect stature, and the man's heart, these Symbols of humanity, is not the continued character of the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonian</hi> Kingdom, as the Remarker would have it, but intermittent and occasional. And lastly, that <hi>Darius Medus</hi> succeeded <hi>Belshazzar</hi> in the Empire, the Remarker may be satisfied out of <hi>Thomas Lydiat. Emendat. Temp.</hi> Anno M. 3469. He that considers what has already been said, will easily discern all the other strained conceits in this Remark to break a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieces of themselves, and therefore I will not mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spend time in needlesly answering such slight mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>

<pb n="226" facs="tcp:48067:127"/>
be also contrary Decrees (by which the building of the Temple was so many years obstructed) instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in to disprove it. But the plain easie sense of the Beast raising it self on one side, is, That whereas the Beast signifies the same Kingdom that, <hi>chap.</hi> 8. is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed by a two-horned Ram, having one Horn higher than the other, the highest whereof came up last; the Rise of the Beast here on one side signifies, that it had its Rise <hi>from</hi> the first Horn, <hi>viz.</hi> the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the <hi>Medes,</hi> though the other Horn (the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian</hi> Kingdom) did over-top the first to obtain the dignity of the Empire.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> Upon mis-information from envious neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, the building of the Temple was some years retarded: But this is to be attributed to the ill will of those neighbours of the <hi>Iews,</hi> not of the <hi>Persian</hi> Monarchs. And it was through their favour alone, that both Temple, City and Walls of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> were built at last. So friendly were those Monarchs to the <hi>Iews.</hi> So that what was borrowed from <hi>Grotius,</hi> was worth the borrowing; but it is but what others have said before, and the <hi>Iews</hi> particularly, as you may see in <hi>Cornelius à lapide.</hi> But this pretty unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected conceit of the Remarker seems utterly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible, as being plainly unnatural. For in what posture could the Bear stand to shew one side to be higher than the other, as the Horns of the Ram are said to be? What, did he stand on his two legs on the right side, with his left legs lift up into the air, that that side might be higher than the other? Wherefore if he raised himself at all, it was on his hinder feet, in a rampant posture; and his thus rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of himself was on one side <gap reason="foreign">

And the distinguishing the signification of the four wings, <hi>as they are wings,</hi> from, <hi>as they are four,</hi> is to separate what the Vision has united, and what is inseparable. For four wings cannot be considered but as four wings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But they, as well as the four heads, denote the Division of <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Kingdom, and do signifie (as the wings of the first Beast did) the haughty aspiring of the Kings of those succeeding Kingdoms, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted state of their Kingdoms.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> How confident either Ignorance or Heedles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness makes the Remarker? This Leopard with four wings of a fowl upon his back, is one and the same Beast, from the beginning to the end, according to the nature of these <hi>Henopoetick</hi> Types; and so what events or actions sute with the symbolical parts of the Creature, are to be referred to those Symbols. Wings therefore being the Symbol of swiftness, the swiftness of <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Victories is notified by them, as the Eagle-wings of the Lion denoted the same. The swiftness of whose expeditions, <hi>viz.</hi> of the King
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:48067:128"/>
of <hi>Babylon, Ieremy</hi> compares to the slight of Eagles, <hi>chap.</hi> 4. and <hi>chap.</hi> 40. Wherefore these four wings of this Leopard answer exquisitely to the description of the He-Goat in the next Chapter, which is the same Empire, <hi>viz.</hi> the Greek. <hi>Behold an He-Goat came from the West on the face of the whole Earth, and touched not the ground.</hi> What did he then but in a manner fly? And what can better set out such a fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, than wings? So fitly do these two Visions ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain one another as to this passage. But in the mean time the Remarker professeth himself of a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull indistinct conception, that cannot distinguish the <hi>nature</hi> of the four wings, in <hi>general,</hi> from the Number of them: wherein yet he contradicts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. For he will not say that the <hi>four</hi> wings as <hi>four</hi> signifie haughty aspiring, but as <hi>wings.</hi> Wherefore as he from the <hi>general</hi> nature of them would have signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied <hi>ambitious aspiring</hi> (which if they did both here and in the Lion, it clashes not with the <hi>Expositor</hi>'s Interpretation, one Symbol being capable of several senses by an <hi>Henopoeia</hi> of the second kind) so the <hi>Expositor</hi> from the said general nature of them will have them signifie <hi>swiftness,</hi> which is at least the more principal sense, as has been proved, and will reach also the swift division of the Greek Empire into four parts, <hi>Alexander</hi> living so little a while after his Conquest.</p>

Though it be difficult to give an account of <hi>Ezekiels</hi> Vision, <hi>chap.</hi> 1. yet I think it may be safely concluded, that the living Creatures and Wheels are not <hi>Angelical,</hi> as is here supposed. For those four living Creatures agreeing in number and name with the four Beasts, <hi>Revel.</hi> 4. (for they are both called <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>) and the four faces of each of these living
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:48067:128"/>
Creatures being the faces of the four Beasts; it shews, that as the last signifies a successive body or society of men, so the other must have the like signification. Which is farther confirmed by their all four having the likeness of a man, and a man's hand under every wing, and their having Calves feet (signifying the labour and travel which is given to men under the Sun) and also by the spirit that is said to be in them and in the wheels. Whereas Angels are called Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and not described by any Spirit abiding in them.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The four faces and the four wings of the living Creatures I take to signifie the same thing, <hi>viz.</hi> The complication in humane nature, of the nature of those four Animals, signified by the faces, that is, of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, Religion, Courage and Industry. Of these four does humane nature consist and subsist by them, they being the life and support of humane affairs. The four wings may signifie the several spirits from which these operations are produced, and the man's hand under each wing the management of all these opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by reason and prudence. The four Beasts, all of them representing the same body or society of Christians, have the same signification with the four faces and wings of each living Creature, but it would not have agreed with them, that each of them should have had four faces, as it doth with the erect stature of the living Creatures; and also it would have been needless, being the same thing is signified by the four several Beasts. Besides, those Beasts ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving six wings, there would have been faces wanting to two of them. 2. Which two wings added to the other four, I take to be the same with the two wings with which the Seraphims fly, <hi>Esay</hi> 6. (these six-winged
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:48067:129"/>
Beasts being the same with those Seraphims) and to signifie that <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>truth</hi> which came by Jesus Christ, or that <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> which he says he is, and thereby the way to the Father. And we being by this grace or life, and truth, quickened and raised unto newness of life in Christ Jesus, whereby we cease to be of the World, and are delivered from the power of darkness, and translated into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of our Lord, and so raised up, and made to sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2.6. they thereby become truly wings to us, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alting us from a worldly or earthly, unto such an heavenly state. <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s Vision therefore of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Creatures and Wheels, I take to be a Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the ruling of the God of <hi>Israel</hi> over his people in a <hi>natural</hi> state, under a <hi>Legal</hi> or <hi>Iudaical</hi> Dispensation, as the twenty four Elders and the four Beasts represent the same rule in a <hi>Christian</hi> state, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Dispensation</hi> of the <hi>Divine life.</hi> The latter of which is to be fulfilled in the <hi>Millennium,</hi> but the former was never fulfilled completely, because the <hi>Iews</hi> failed of living up to the height of that Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation. 3. But this Vision of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> and his other also of the Temple, seem to be designed for the like purpose, as the Tree of life was planted in Paradise, <hi>viz.</hi> to signifie that Dispensation of life which men in due time were to be admitted unto, but not then, the natural earthly state of man not admitting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. 4. So likewise the two mentioned Visions, the first of them seems to signifie the <hi>Spiritual power</hi> wherewith God would have ruled over his people, and the last the <hi>Spiritual communion</hi> he would have had with them, with the blessing attending the same, if they had walked perfectly with him, according to
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:48067:129"/>
all his righteous judgments in that legal dispensation. 5. Hence the close of the Vision of the Temple is. [The name of the City from that day shall be, The Lord is there] that is, from the time they shall keep and observe all the Laws and Ordinances then deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. 6. And hence the God of <hi>Israel</hi> on sending <hi>Ezekiel</hi> to prophesie the ruine of the City, and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and Captivity of the people does (to render their iniquity more heinous) shew himself to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet in the glory of that government which their transgressions made them fail of, or fall from, to be cast off.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Two instances of their falling from that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment are, First, their making the Calf, whereon God, who, <hi>Exod.</hi> 29.45, 46. had promised to dwell among them, does, <hi>chap.</hi> 33.2, 3. say, he will send his Angel before them, but refuseth to go up in the midst of them, lest he destroy them. Secondly, their desiring a King, which is said to be not the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting of <hi>Samuel,</hi> but of God to rule over them. 8. The Wheels I take to be the same to the four li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Creatures, as the four Beasts are to the twenty four Elders, <hi>viz.</hi> as the <hi>Governed</hi> to the <hi>Governours.</hi> 9. And both the Wheels and living Creatures being under the Throne, and not rising, but as lifted up; nor moving, but as acted by the spirit, which was in both, seems to signifie the natural earthly state of those they represent, whereby they were as mere passive Subjects to the actings of the Spirit of God upon them, like as the Prophets were to the Spirit of Prophecy that came upon them: 10. Whereas the four Beasts are upon the Throne; and the twenty four Elders surround it, sitting on their seats in their Kingly and Princely Habits, signifying the Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:48067:130"/>
station they are exalted to by the Spirit of God, being a Principle of life dwelling in them; from which new nature they become as active spirits, to doe what the others have no power unto, but by the adventitious acting of the Spirit of God upon them. 11. The living Creatures appearing like burning Coals, and Lamps may signifie the burning zeal or spirit of <hi>Elias</hi> they are acted by, in distinction from the pure serene Christian spirit of faith working by love, which answers to the still small voice, which afec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Prophet more than the precedent strong Wind, and Earthquake, and Fire. Hence though our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our calls <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptist a burning and shining light, yet he says, <hi>He that is least in the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, is greater than he.</hi> 12. That the Temple-Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on designs to set forth such a perfect legal state of righteousness and the <hi>Spiritual communion</hi> attending the same, as aforesaid, seems concludible. First, from <hi>Chap.</hi> 43.10, 11. where the Prophet is commanded to shew the house of <hi>Israel</hi> the pattern of the house, that they may be ashamed; which if they be, he is to shew them all the form, and Laws and Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of it, that they may keep and doe them. So that all the Laws and Ordinances given by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, after the manner of Levitical Law, are of the same import, and to be taken in the same sense with those delivered by it, which they had before broken. 13. Secondly, from the Oblation of the holy por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, being 25000 Reeds square, and the City being 5000, and the Sanctuary 500 square, which all are symbolical Numbers of a natural or fleshly state. So that as the Number of the Beast 666 (the root of which is 25) sets forth a complete, carnal, politick state, according to humane natural Wisedom; so
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:48067:130"/>
here seems to be signified the perfection of a people in a natural state, by being solely under the conduct and government of divine Laws, and the righteous Judgments of God agreeable to that state. 14. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the 18000 measures, which is the compass of the City, being the Perimeter of the Cube of 12000 furlongs, which is the Cubical measure of the <hi>New Ierusalem,</hi> as appears by Mr. <hi>Potter,</hi> whereby seems to be signified, that the one represents the state of a people under the Rule of Divine Laws, and the righteous Judgments of God, according to an <hi>exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> legal state, so long as they can perfectly conform thereunto: And the other such a <hi>solid</hi> state of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, or <hi>inward</hi> Dispensation of life, as does in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able men to a perfect walking with God, by fulfilling all his righteous Judgments. But as our Saviour hath taught us first to cleanse the inside of the Cup, that the outside may be clean also; so it's onely by the <hi>inward</hi> Dispensation of the latter, whereby we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come able to fulfill the righteousness designed by the former. So that the waters out of the Sanctuary becoming a River, and the Trees growing on the banks thereof, with what else in this Vision agrees with that of the <hi>New Ierusalem,</hi> signifies what would have been fulfilled in the <hi>Israelites</hi> in that state, if they could have been ashamed of all their iniquities, and kept all the Laws, Forms and Ordinances then given, and what will be fulfilled in that righteous state, wherein all the Statutes and Judgments of God shall be duly performed. 15. As to the difference of the <hi>Mosaical</hi> Laws, and the Laws of <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the Reason thereof is, That the one delivers to them what was required of them that they should doe, the other what they ought to doe, to live up to
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:48067:131"/>
the height of that Dispensation, whereby to become partakers of the Blessings thence signified. But e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of Conjectures about things so obscure and mysterious.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> The Remarker, according to that competent share of confidence Nature has endued him with, thinks it may be <hi>safely</hi> concluded that the living Creatures and Wheels are not <hi>Angelical.</hi> But does he think it so <hi>safe</hi> a thing to conclude of his own private opinion against the sense (to say nothing of the consent of Christian Interpreters) of the whole School of the <hi>Iewish Rabbins,</hi> who as they call their <hi>Natural</hi> Philosophy <hi>Bereshith,</hi> so their more abstruse <hi>Theology</hi> touching <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Angels,</hi> they call <hi>Merca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah,</hi> which is this very Vision of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> and signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, <hi>Currus,</hi> a <hi>Chariot?</hi> And that the Chariot of God is <hi>Angelical,</hi> is plain from that in <hi>Psal.</hi> 68.17. <hi>The Chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands of Angels, and the Lord is among them, as in Sinai in the holy place.</hi> In which <hi>Sinai Moses</hi> also saw this glory of the Lord, <hi>Exod.</hi> 24. And <hi>chap.</hi> 25.18. he is commanded to make two golden <hi>Cherubims</hi> (in imitation of this <hi>Cherubick</hi> Chariot which <hi>Ezekiel</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards saw) which were to be placed upon the Ark, where was to be the Throne of God in the Temple.

                        <hi>Cherub.</hi> But it tends all to one, the <hi>Cherubims</hi> being his Chariot. And what follows, [He came flying on the wings of the wind] the word there is <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, which signifies a <hi>Spirit</hi> as well as a <hi>Wind,</hi> and so the whole sense may be, he rid on his <hi>Chariot, viz.</hi> his <hi>Angelical</hi> Chariot, and was carried swiftly on the wings of his ministring <hi>Spirits,</hi> that readily
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:48067:131"/>
execute his word. And <hi>Psal.</hi> 99. <hi>He sitteth between the Cherubims,</hi> &amp;c. And these living Creatures in this Vision of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> ch. 10. are at least ten times called <hi>Cherubims.</hi> And are not <hi>Cherubims</hi> Angels? And the same may be said of the <hi>Seraphins,</hi> Esay 6. which is a like Representation of the Divine Majesty, are they not Angels?</p>
                     <p>But the Remarker alledges Reasons why the living Creatures in <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s Vision are not Angels. First, because these four living Creatures agree in number and name with the four Beasts, <hi>Revel.</hi> 4. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>they</hi> signifying a successive body of men, <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel</hi>'s four living Creatures must signifie a body of men also. Secondly, they all four have the likeness of a man, and a man's hand under every wing, and therefore they must be men that are signified there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. Thirdly, they have Calves-feet, which signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the laboriousness of men under the Sun. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and lastly, A spirit is said to be in them, and in the Wheels. Wherefore Angels cannot be signified by either, Angels being called Spirits, and not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed by any Spirit abiding in them.</p>
                     <p>But in answer to this, I say, First, that this Vision is an Ideal <hi>Symbolum,</hi> or <hi>Symbolical</hi> Idea of the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Majesty and Empire of the God of <hi>Israel</hi> over the whole Angelical World, divided into four parts (the <hi>Cabbalists</hi> give names to them, <hi>Azeluthick, Briathick, Ietzirathick</hi> and <hi>Asiathick</hi>) he ruling them by the Divine Influence of his <hi>Spirit,</hi> whereby he has the perfect and absolute command over them. This Symbolical <hi>Idea</hi> of the glory of the God of <hi>Israel Moses</hi> saw in the Mount, and ordered things accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this pattern in the Mount, as he was directed, of which the <hi>Cherubims</hi> on the Ark of the Covenant
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:48067:132"/>
is part, as also the pitching of the Tents of the <hi>Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> about the Tabernacle, in four parts, with the Standards bearing the names of these four living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, in their Camp. These were an external Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Symbolical <hi>Idea</hi> of the Angelical King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the God of <hi>Israel,</hi> but their Dispensation reached not to the Life and Reality thereof, but they bore it onely in the outward Image. But this stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Symbolical <hi>Idea</hi> is that Seal which the Divine Providence intends so thoroughly to impress on his Church at last in way of Life and Perfection, that the God of <hi>Israel,</hi> by the Influence of his <hi>Spirit,</hi> will so actuate his Church, that his Will will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven, or in the Angelical World by his holy Angels. To which purpose this Vision is again exhibited to <hi>Iohn</hi> in the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> as a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation of the blessed state of the <hi>Millennium,</hi> when the State of the Church will answer this Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical <hi>Idea</hi> in the truth of Life, or plenteous Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation of the Spirit. Here therefore is the Remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker's mistake, that he fansies that the standing Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical <hi>Idea</hi> of the Angelical World, where there is no Death nor Succession cannot set out the State of the Church on Earth, where there is Death and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession. Which, methinks, is as awkardly argued, as if one should imagine, that St. <hi>Michael</hi> the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angel being the Seal of some Corporation, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for the signing of successive Leases of that Corporation; the Seal should be argued successive, and not to be the same standing Individual Seal, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Wax and Leases it seals are not so, and consequently that the Seal cannot be the Image of St. <hi>Michael</hi> the Archangel, because he is one stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Person, and not in Succession. Wherefore it is
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:48067:132"/>
plain, that the standing Symbolical <hi>Idea</hi> of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Kingdom, which is unsuccessive, may notifie the <hi>Millennial</hi> Kingdom of Christ on Earth, which is successive, and the said Kingdom be examined by it how near it is to the Pattern, as the Seals of Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses how near they are to the standing Original Seal of the abovesaid Corporation.</p>
                     <p>To the second I say, Those four living Creatures having the likeness of a man, and the hand of a man under each wing, does not prove these Angels to be men, but rather proves that the Remarker is mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the nature of Angels, as if they had either no form (which is impossible, they being finite Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or a round form, as if they were so many Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real or Aethereal Foot-balls or contracted Hedg-hogs. But if they have distinct Animal Forms, what can it be but humane, all conceived imperfections being removed therefrom, and nothing taken in but what will well consist with Heavenly Beauty and Glory? Wherefore let their Figure for the main be humane, and other variations in them onely Symbolical Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendages; it does not follow from thence, that they are not the standing Symbolical <hi>Idea</hi> of the Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Kingdom, but rather that the Angels are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally in humane shape. For that this Vision signifies Angels, is plain, in that they are called <hi>Cherubims.</hi> But if one will be here resty and perverse, there will be no room left for any Cavils; if we answer, that the faces of a man, and the hands of a man signifie no otherwise than the faces of a Lion, Oxe and Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, or the feet of a Calf, they all signifying onely symbolically.</p>
                     <p>Which Answer will weaken also the third Reason. For the feet of a Calf need signifie nothing but what
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:48067:133"/>
is competible to the Angelical nature, as the face of an Oxe or Calf does no other, it may signifie robusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous indefatigable strength. And <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> which signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies God or an Angel, has its Notation from strength, and is ordinarily translated <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> by the Seventy. And to give a reason why all the four Beasts have Calves feet, is obvious enough, because that which supports ought to be strong. But there are farther Cabbalistical Mysteries touching that point, which is needless here to enter upon. It is sufficient that we have hitherto proved, that the three first Reasons have no force to evince, that these living Creatures and Wheels are not Angelical.</p>
                     <p>And for the last Reason, it is the slightest of all, as if Angels, which are Spirits, were not to be actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated by the Spirit of God as well as the Souls of men are. Whenas by virtue of the Divine Spirit they escape the being turned into Devils. And indeed the many Reins whereby the God of <hi>Israel</hi> rules and governs the four Provinces of his Angelical Kingdom is the Influence of his Divine Spirit, which unites with their spirits, and they with it, whereby he drives them whither he pleases. For his Spirit is as sure to be effectually in their pure Essence, as the Rays of the Sun in the clear Air. Wherefore there being such solid proofs, that the living Creatures in <hi>Ezeki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi>'s Vision are Angelical, and none but invalid Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments against it, it is an argument that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marker has much mistaken himself in thinking it was so <hi>safe</hi> to conclude the contrary.</p>
                     <p>The rest of the Remark is a Digression into an Ethical or Ethico-political explication of the Vision of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> which though it were true and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptionable, the <hi>Expositor</hi> is not concerned to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:48067:133"/>
with, as not at all enervating the Philosophical account of that Vision, he admitting both a <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical</hi> and <hi>Moral</hi> Cabbala, touching both the <hi>Bere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shith</hi> and <hi>Mercavah</hi> too. But that the <hi>Remarker</hi>'s pains may not seem to be over much slighted, I will consider some passages in it.</p>
                     <p>First then, He makes the four faces the four wings, and the four Beasts to signifie but one and the same thing, which is a marvellous slubbering and hudling things together, which surely have more distinct meanings. Certainly it must be some great and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struse Mystery that is thus repeatedly both by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Wings, and whole bodies of the four Beasts and living Creatures, and thus pompously set out. And yet it is onely this; That there are these four Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties in Humane Nature, Reason, Religion, Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and Industry. Which lying so bare and obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to every understanding, what is this but the making the Spirit of Prophecy to trifle, in setting out so pompously such a trivial Theory that no man is ignorant of; nay I may say, and that so maimed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and unfitly? For the Elephant certainly had been a more fit Animal to represent Religion than the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, so that there is a fitting Animal wanting to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note the property of Religion in Humane nature. And for as much as Brutes have Reason, and Man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone properly Religion, Man had been a better Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bol of Religion than an Eagle. But then there had wanted an Animal to typifie Reason, unless you made Man the Type of both, and put the Eagle quite out of office. Thus crude and broken is the Remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker's conceit in this matter.</p>
                     <p>Again, There are good Scriptural-phrases produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced about the two flying wings of the Seraphins,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:48067:134"/>
which he will have the same with the third pair of wings of the Beasts, but the Application is, methinks, much of the Hooks. For the two flying wings of the Seraphins, <hi>Esay</hi> 6. signifie the readiness and expedite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their Ministry enjoyn'd by God to the service of his Church, whenas he referrs it to the exalting of ones self from a Worldly and Earthly, to a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly state.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, That seems a precarious groundless con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, or rather false. That the Tree of Life was not set in Paradise for <hi>Adam</hi> to eat of, but to play at Chop-cherry with him, and to mock him; whenas the Text says, <hi>The Lord commanded the Man, saying, Of every tree of the Garden thou shalt eat</hi>; and I hope the Tree of life was one of them. The Original is, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, thou hast plenary commission, if not command, to eat of all, saving the Tree of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of good and evil. Which had been a mere mocking of <hi>Adam,</hi> if he had no power of eating of the Tree of Life.</p>
                     <p>And now, fourthly, this being a fundamental mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake of the <hi>Remarker</hi> in the case of <hi>Adam,</hi> the like discovers it self in his conceit touching the <hi>Iews,</hi> and the two Visions of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> that of the <hi>four living Creatures,</hi> and that other of the <hi>Temple.</hi> God gave no impossible Commands to the <hi>Iews.</hi> But those ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite descriptions of things touching the <hi>Temple</hi> by a long and operose <hi>Hylasmus</hi> and <hi>Israelismus,</hi> set not out what the <hi>Iews</hi> should have been, if they had kept these Ordinances exquisitely, but what the Church of Christ would be (of which the <hi>Iews</hi> were a <hi>Type,</hi>) in process of time. That this is the sense of that Vision, the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> that borrows so many things from it, and uses such frequent Allusions to
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:48067:134"/>
the <hi>Temple,</hi> does sufficiently indicate. Nor is there any other sense of the Vision of the <hi>four living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> as touching the <hi>Iews,</hi> who were not upon condition of legal performances, to arrive to that <hi>Angelical</hi> State, that the Christian Church with them will arrive to at last. But the Divino-politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal sense of that Vision (which yet is most proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly applied to it as repeated in the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> which relates to the Camp of the <hi>Iews</hi> a figure of the State of the Christian Church to come) is that the Church of God at last will answer the Pattern of the <hi>Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Kingdom,</hi> and God's Will will be done on <hi>Earth</hi> as it is in <hi>Heaven.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fifthly, The Name of the City, The Lord is there, is the very Indication of the state of the <hi>New Ierusalem,</hi> which is a demonstration it was never intended for the <hi>Iews</hi> under their Legal Dispensation upon any terms.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, <hi>Ezekiel</hi> is not here sent to Prophesie the Ruine of the City and Temple, they both having been destroyed fourteen years before. But they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing destroyed, he in this Hylastick and Israelistick way prophesies of the state of the <hi>New Ierusalem,</hi> which the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> also describes.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly therefore, The <hi>Iews</hi> their making a golden Calf, and craving a King, whatever other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences it may cause to them, it could not make them forfeit that which was never intended them in that state.</p>
                     <p>Eighthly, If the Beasts be the <hi>Governed,</hi> and the four and twenty Elders the <hi>Governours,</hi> how come the Beasts to be upon the Throne, and the twenty four Elders onely about it?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="242" facs="tcp:48067:135"/>Ninthly, The Wheels and living Creatures being not moved, but as acted by the spirit, does not sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie an <hi>Earthly</hi> state in them, but the most <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Heavenly,</hi> viz. an <hi>Vnselfwilledness</hi> in them. That they have no <hi>Self excursions</hi> of mind or will, but that the Spirit of life from the eternal mind is the perpetual principle of their <hi>motion</hi> and <hi>rest.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Tenthly, That the four Beasts are not upon the Throne, I have shew'd upon that place of the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calypse</hi>; and that he contradicts himself in saying so, I observed even now in the eighth Note.</p>
                     <p>Eleventhly, The burning Coals, which are <hi>Prunae,</hi> do not signifie the Spirit of <hi>Elias</hi> in <hi>Men,</hi> but the <hi>Seraphick</hi> Spirit in <hi>Angels,</hi> as <hi>Seraphin</hi> from <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> has its denomination, <hi>viz.</hi> from <hi>burning.</hi> And the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphin</hi> are counted of the higher sort of Angels. And as for Lamps, they are in the description of the scene of the <hi>New Ierusalem,</hi> Apoc. 4.</p>
                     <p>Now for the Temple, I say, Twelfthly, That the whole Vision of the Temple concerns the Christian Church, and therefore that command to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>chap.</hi> 43.10, 11. respects especially the <hi>Thya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirian</hi> and <hi>Sardian</hi> Interval thereof, that they may repent of all their sins and corruptions, and so make what haste they can toward that excellent State of the Church, which is prefigured by the Vision of the <hi>Temple.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirteenthly, As for the Numbers 25000, 5000, and 500 <hi>Ezek.</hi> chap. 45. and 666 in the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> nothing more can be signified by the former, <hi>viz.</hi> those in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> than that the <hi>New Ierusalem</hi> will gratifie even the <hi>external</hi> man also, and his <hi>outward</hi> senses; which the <hi>Quinary</hi> number does denote, namely, that even the <hi>outward</hi> State of the Church
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:48067:135"/>
then will be rich and glorious, according to what is likewise prophesied of in the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> that <hi>the Kings of the Earth shall bring their honour and glory into it.</hi> And it is the encouraging Prediction of Christ himself, <hi>Seek the Kingdom of God and his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,</hi> and all worldly good things shall be added thereto. Which will most amply be fulfilled in the <hi>Millennial</hi> Empire of Christ, which is that eminent Kingdom of God upon Earth. And for that other Number 666, it is not set down to signifie the most complete, carnal, politick State, but to be a certain character of the Pontifician Hierarchy the <hi>two-horned</hi> Beast, who are discovered to have affected the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 25, which is the root of 666. That is the main drift of that Number, though deluding their follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers with pleasing Objects of sense may haply be aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at thereby also.</p>
                     <p>Fourteenthly, The 18000 measures, which is the compass of <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s City agreeing with the Perime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the <hi>New Ierusalem,</hi> whose Solid or Cubick mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure is 12000 furlongs in the <hi>Apocalypse</hi>; the true and usefull meaning of that is, to assure us that <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel</hi>'s Vision of the <hi>Temple</hi> is a Prophecy of the State of the Church, which is set out by S. <hi>Iohn</hi> in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of the <hi>New Ierusalem,</hi> that men may make no vagaries into any other fancies, as the Remarker has done here. And the Wisedom and Providence of God is admirable herein. Besides, if that <hi>Externality</hi> or <hi>Superficiality</hi> were aimed at, which the Remarker would have signified, the measure of the <hi>Superficies</hi> of the <hi>Cube,</hi> not the <hi>Perimeter,</hi> would have been set down and made use of.</p>
                     <p>Fifteenthly, The difference of the Mosaical Laws, and those of <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s Temple, the greater exactness
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:48067:136"/>
of these above the other, is not that the <hi>Iews</hi> may obtain the blessedness of the <hi>New-Ierusalem</hi> state by a legal performance of them, which, as I noted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, had been but a mockery; but farther to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, that the <hi>Temple</hi>-Vision is a Prophecy of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian State, of greater perfection than that of the <hi>Iews,</hi> though prefigured here, as in the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> by Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Ordinances belonging to the Temple.</p>
                     <p>And lastly, Though the Remarker, as to his main scope, is most certainly in a mistake, yet his Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceit is such, as it was not for every ordinary Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius to hit upon, and he has ever and anon decked it with sundry piously sounding Sentences and Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture phrases, though they had not the luck to be right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly applied. And this may be an Accession to his former commendableness, that he abates something of his wonted stifness, and is content to let what he has said to go for a conjecture onely.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vers.</hi> 14. To make <hi>all</hi> People and Nations to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie <hi>some</hi> of all People and Nations, is a making too bold with the Text. But the words will be absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true of all Nations within the extent of Christ's Kingdom, and in some degrees true of all the other Nations, who will doe a kind of Homage to him by the walking in the light of the <hi>New Ierusalem,</hi> and bringing their glory and honour into it. That man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in which this is supposed to be fulfilled between the time of <hi>Constantine</hi> and the Apostacy, is such as does in no manner agree with the state of Christ's Kingdom, as is shewed in Remarks on the <hi>Exposition</hi> of the <hi>Revelation.</hi> Of the four sentences supposed here to be represented, the first and last might have been spared. For here is onely signified the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Beast (which includes the little Horn)
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:48067:136"/>
and the settling of Christ in his Kingdom on Earth. And the assigning the Kingdom to him, besides the settling of him in it, is an insignificant distinction.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> The fore part of this Remark is so slight, that the best Answering of it is to slight it. And as for that which follows, and were more material if it were true, <hi>viz.</hi> That the State of the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Constantine</hi> and the <hi>Apostacy</hi> is in no manner agreeing with the State of Christ's Kingdom, it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictious to the very Visions of the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> chap. 12.10. <hi>Now is come salvation and strength, and the Kingdom of our God, and the Power of his Christ.</hi> Which is upon <hi>Michael</hi>'s overcoming the Dragon. Which all men in their wits, that consider these things understand of the Christians deliverance from their Pagan Persecutours by <hi>Constantine.</hi> And I have shown all the affected Paradoxes of the Remarker, how vain, how groundless and false they are in my Answer to his former <hi>Remarks</hi> on the <hi>Exposition</hi> of the <hi>Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lypse.</hi> And lastly, as for the four Sentences. The first is very pertinent and significant, it being so agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Crown given to him on the white Horse, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 6.2. The second and third are acknowledged by the Remarker, and the fourth is made good from the tenth verse of this present Chapter, where it is said, <hi>the Iudgment was set, and the books were opened.</hi> Which answers to <hi>Apoc.</hi> 20.11, 12. and Expositors make the Judgment to reach to the last day here in <hi>Daniel,</hi> as well as it does there in the <hi>Apocalypse.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <hi>Vision</hi> 3. <hi>Vers.</hi> 8, 9.</head>
                     <p>THough <hi>Seleucus</hi> was not one of the four nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Horns, yet he with his Predecessors in the same Kingdom were one of them. And as there was many changes of the line in the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Kingdom, yet all made but one Horn, so the <hi>Seleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidae,</hi> with their <hi>Predecessors,</hi> make but one Horn in the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Kingdom. And the <hi>Seleucidae</hi> and <hi>Lagidae</hi> being the two chief Kingdoms which suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded <hi>Alexander</hi> (of which there is so large a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy under the Titles of the King of the North and the King of the South) it's strange that one of them should prove none of the four Horns his Kingdom was branched into. And it's yet more strange, that the little Horn which was to arise in the latter time of those Kingdoms, should be applied to <hi>Seleucus,</hi> who arose soon after the beginning of them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> The Remarker seems not to mind what he says in this Remark. For how could <hi>Seleucus,</hi> with his Predecessors, make one Horn in the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Kingdom, when no Horn can be here meant but what succeeded the great Horn, <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great? And never any one made the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Kingdom one of the four Horns. But by help of <hi>Ptolemy, Seleucus</hi> did not onely recover his Satrapy of <hi>Babylon,</hi> which <hi>Antigonus</hi> would have deprived him of; but in a short time vanquishing both <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonus</hi> and his Son made himself Master of <hi>Asia,</hi> as well as of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Babylonia,</hi> and therefore himself be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan the race of the Kings of the North, which is so
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:48067:137"/>
famous in the Prophecy of <hi>Daniel,</hi> though he was by no means one of the four notable Horns that imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately succeeded <hi>Alexander,</hi> nor so reputed by Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians. The thing is so, nor can it be helpt. But he may be a remoter successour of <hi>Alexander,</hi> in that he succeeded <hi>Antigonus</hi> in the main of his Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and so may be fansied as of the line of one of the immediate notable Horns, successours of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> though this be more than needs. And as for the other difficulty that is raised, how the little Horn that was to arise in the latter time of those Kingdoms should be applied to <hi>Seleucus,</hi> who arose soon after the beginning of them, we are to observe how the Angel, <hi>v.</hi> 23. by an <hi>Idiconoea</hi> falls upon <hi>Antiochus E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piphanes,</hi> who is but one part of the little Horn, but hugely to be noted, by reason of the affairs of the Church of God. But expounding the Vision by way of a <hi>Geniconoea,</hi> the little Horn will take in <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leucus,</hi> and reach to the end of that line of the <hi>Syrian</hi> Kings, or Kings of the North. See the Expositor's Notes on this Vision, and there you will find several Examples of <hi>Geniconoea's</hi> and <hi>Idiconoea's,</hi> and thence understand the Reasonableness and Solidity of the answer to this difficulty.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vers.</hi> 26. I am inclined to think, that as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi> is agreed to be Typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal of Antichrist, so the 2300 days have a propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal as well as a literal sense. Else it had been a more ready way, and more agreeable to the general course of the Prophecies to have computed the time by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical days. Also the saying that the Vision is <hi>for many days,</hi> that is, <hi>a long time,</hi> does seem to import the same. For whenas <hi>Haggai</hi> says, <hi>Yet a little while and the Lord shall shake Heaven and Earth,</hi> &amp;c. and
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:48067:138"/>
                        <hi>Malachy,</hi> That <hi>the Lord whom ye seek will suddenly come to his Temple,</hi> &amp;c. where the Prophets express a <hi>longer</hi> time by a <hi>little while</hi> and <hi>suddenly,</hi> it's strange that a shorter time here should be called a long time. So that these 2300 days may prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically signifie some time of the <hi>Millennium,</hi> that may properly signifie the cleansing of the Sanctuary. For after the overthrow of the Antichristian Party at the seventh Trumpet, and the seventh Vial, there may be a long time spent before all the corruptions intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the Beast and false Prophet in each of their Governments be eradicated to the accomplishing of that saying of our Saviour, <hi>Every plant which my Heavenly Father has not planted shall be rooted up.</hi> For as the main Rise of those Corruptions was gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness of gain, so mens Interests will be so interwo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with them as to make an absolute extirpation of them, a work of time and difficulty. And this work may be signified by what <hi>Ezekiel</hi> speaks of burning the weapons of <hi>Gog,</hi> and burying all his multitudes in the Valley of <hi>Hamon Gog,</hi> and cleansing the Land. And also by the Hailstones of a Talent weight, and the casting of the Beast and false Prophet into the lake of Fire (<hi>viz.</hi> as to one sense of the lake of Fire) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what is said of them in my Remarks.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> That the 2300 days have a plain literal sense, is manifest from the Text it self, which saith, The Vision of the Evening and Morning is true. In the Original it is <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, that is, It is a <hi>plain</hi> Truth, not <hi>aenigmatically</hi> or <hi>symbolically</hi> expressed. For in the other sense all the Visions of <hi>Daniel</hi> are true, which passage here would imply they were false, unless <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> had this signification in this place, and the same that <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> has in the foregoing Vision, <hi>v.</hi> 16. and 19. which
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:48067:138"/>
                        <hi>Munster</hi> in his <hi>Chaldee</hi> Dictionary saith is the same with <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. And our English Translation in both those verses says, <hi>I asked him the</hi> Truth <hi>of all this</hi>; and <hi>I would knew the</hi> Truth <hi>of the fourth Beast</hi>; not that <hi>Daniel</hi> doubted but the Vision was true, but he would know the <hi>plain</hi> Truth or meaning of those Symboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Representations. Whence it is plain that <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <hi>Truth</hi> in these cases is not opposed to <hi>Falshood,</hi> but to <hi>Symbols, Parables</hi> or <hi>Aenigmes.</hi> And therefore the Expositor being assured that the literal sense of the 2300 days was true, and being more solicitous of writing nothing but what was true than adventurous upon things uncertain, though he took in the <hi>Typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> sense of the little Horn, as it denoted <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi>; yet he would not at that time declare, that the 2300 days were <hi>Typical</hi> also, and signified so many years, which is nothing so certain as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But if they be <hi>Typical</hi> (as the <hi>Expositor</hi> has thought of it before he see these <hi>Remarks,</hi> nor was averse therefrom) the <hi>Epocha</hi> in all likelihood is to be taken from the profanation of the Temple by <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus Epiphanes,</hi> as the <hi>Epocha</hi> of those Numbers is, <hi>chap.</hi> 12. From whence it will follow, that it will be from the present year about 450 years, till the Church of Christ be cleansed from its corruptions and his <hi>Millennial</hi> Reign begin upon Earth. Which 450 years partly belong to the <hi>Residue</hi> of the first <hi>Thunder,</hi> which contains the seven <hi>Vials,</hi> and partly to the second <hi>Thunder,</hi> in which is the descent and settlement of the <hi>New Ierusalem,</hi> the City or Polity <hi>Antistoechal</hi> to the then ruined <hi>Babylon.</hi> But how much of these 450 years is to be allotted to the <hi>Residue</hi> of the <hi>Vials,</hi> and how much to the <hi>second Thunder,</hi> the event must shew; if the 2300 days have also a Symbolical sense.
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:48067:139"/>
But that after the overthrow of <hi>Babylon</hi> there will be such a huge while till every evil plant be rooted out of the Church, is a mere conceit of the Remarker. If things were lest to his sancifull <hi>Anarchical</hi> way, world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Interests might the more easily slacken the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch; but a truly <hi>Holy,</hi> and a truly <hi>Oecumenical</hi> Council, whose Laws shall bind all Christendom, will expedite the business in a competent time. So that the Interval of the second Thunder need not be so long, nor the burning of the weapons of <hi>Gog,</hi> and the burying all his Multitudes in the Valley of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Gog,</hi> and cleansing the Land, take up so tedious a time. By which, if the overthrow of <hi>Babylon</hi> is signified, that passage in the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> chap. 20.5 <hi>But the rest of the dead lived not again, till the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand years were finished,</hi> though it most naturally and certainly intimates a <hi>Physical</hi> Resurrection preceding of the Martyrs, may also haply insinuate a <hi>Political</hi> Resurrection of those multitudes buried in <hi>Hamon Gog,</hi> that they shall not rise again till the thousand years be past; but after that, they will so multiply, that they will besiege the Holy and beloved City, and seem to hazard the true Apostolick Church, her being brought once again under the yoke of the wicked. The Hailstones of a Talent weight, and the lake of Fire belong to the first Thunder rather than to the second.</p>

                     <p>THough there be no Mystery in breaking the number here, yet sure it's not an insignificant Hebrew Idiom, but that there's a reason for the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, as there is in the mentioned <hi>Gen.</hi> 5. where it's so oft used, <hi>viz.</hi> To distinguish the time of those Patriarchs lives before they began to have children from the time of their lives after. But as to the instance of <hi>Gen.</hi> 8.3. there's no such breaking of the number there. And as to <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 45.12. there's also a reason for it, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Maneh</hi> being sixty She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kels, is said to consist of 20, 25 and 15<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Shekels, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause those three were several sorts of Coin, which together made up the <hi>Maneh.</hi> And so the Text here does plainly import a reason of breaking the Number, <hi>viz.</hi> that it would be seven Prophetick weeks before the building of the Temple and City be completed, and that it would after continue to built for sixty two such weeks till the Time of the Messiah, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> This is the onely place where the <hi>Remarker</hi> may seem to have got the <hi>Expositor</hi> upon the hip. But he will fling two men at once then, <hi>Grotius</hi> and the <hi>Expositor</hi> that adheres to him. The words of <hi>Grotius</hi> upon the place are these, <hi>Duo hîc notanda Hebraeos numerum perfectum in particulas scindere, ut</hi> Ezek. 45.12. <hi>deinde verò numerum minorem praepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nere majori, ut,</hi> Gen. 5. <hi>saepissimè</hi> Gen. 8.3. <hi>&amp; alibi saepe.</hi> The <hi>Expositor</hi> has followed this Copy exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitely, and in <hi>Grotius</hi> his order; and the <hi>Remarker</hi>
                        <pb n="252" facs="tcp:48067:140"/>
should have done so, if he would have done fair. <hi>Grotius</hi> from <hi>Ezek.</hi> 45.12. observes that the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew sometimes divides a full number into parts: <hi>Twenty shekels, five and twenty shekels, fifteen shekels shall be your Maneh.</hi> This dividing of sixty into 20, 25 and 15, <hi>Grotius</hi> took onely to be an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Idiom, he finding so little reason otherwise for it; and though some with the like confidence the <hi>Remarker</hi> does, give the same reason with him, yet <hi>Vatablus</hi> and <hi>Clarius</hi> the one says [<hi>sortè</hi>]. and the other [<hi>opinor</hi>] to the business, which are indicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their uncertainty therein; And shews the cautiousness of <hi>Grotius,</hi> that he would rather resolve the business into an Hebrew Idiom, than content himself with such conjectures. For mine own part, I suspect it to be a mere <hi>Propheticism,</hi> as I may so speak, that is, a prophetick scheme or propriety of speech usefull for <hi>concealment</hi> (which is one scope of the Prophetick style) or the making the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy look more <hi>obscure</hi> and <hi>mysterious,</hi> something like to that, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 9.15. which I cannot insist on here.</p>
                     <p>This for the dividing a full number into several parts. Of putting the lesser number before the greater, those <hi>Gen.</hi> 5. are repeated Examples; the Remarker's reason whereof seems less probable, it implying that some of the Patriarchs should live near two hundred years before they begot any children, and that <hi>Adam</hi> had no child till he begot <hi>Seth</hi>; and being it's plain he had, others might have so also. Which makes the Remarker's Reason quite fail. And as for <hi>Gen.</hi> 8.3. According to the Hebrew it is, <hi>And after the end of, [<gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>] the fifty and the hundred days the waters were abated.</hi>
                        <pb n="253" facs="tcp:48067:140"/>
Which is a plain instance of what <hi>Grotius</hi> would have. And therefore it was more adviseable for the <hi>Expositor</hi> to decline an Historical account of dividing the 69 weeks into 7 and 62, upon <hi>Grotius</hi> his Critical account thereof, than to adventure to say with the <hi>Remarker,</hi> that it would be 7 Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical weeks from the going out of the Decree before the building of the Temple and City be completed, which is not applicable to any History. And if there be any thing in it, it being a thing onely by the bye, and uncertain, the main thing aimed at being the manifestation of the Messias, at the end of the 7 and 62 weeks joined together, and the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positor</hi> being solicitous to make no application of History but what was certain and true, he deserves rather thanks and commendation for his care to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose upon none, than to be cavilled at by the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marker</hi> for not being as rash as himself, in making vain conjectures. But if there be any thing in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming these 7 weeks a-part before the other, the most credible account is that of <hi>Thomas Lydiat</hi> in his <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nones Chronici,</hi> that it respects the time of the Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of <hi>Nehemias</hi> over <hi>Iudaea.</hi> But I think it not worth the while to concern my self in it.</p>

                     <p>IT's much distortion of the words [And the thing is true] to make them signifie, It's <hi>plainly</hi> deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and not <hi>enigmatically</hi> in Symbols. For the things so delivered are as true as those which are plainly delivered. But those words do refer to the following words, <hi>viz.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> It's so far from being much distortion of the words to translate <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> And the thing was a <hi>plain</hi> Truth, no <hi>Aenigme</hi> or <hi>Parable,</hi> that it is the onely easie, true and natural sense of them, as may appear from what we have said upon the third Vision, <hi>v.</hi> 26. For here <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> is again used in that sense, that it and the Chaldee <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap> is noted to have, viz. <hi>plain truth</hi> without <hi>Aenigmatical</hi> figures. And therefore <hi>Daniel</hi> says of it, that he understood the thing, and had understanding of the Vision or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, without asking any Interpreter, as he does in those Symbolical Visions. What a natural cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence this is with the foregoing words? But to say that the thing is said to be true for fear, because the time is long, the Vision or Prophecy should be sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected of falshood, is a very frigid account. For that was needless, it being a Divine Prediction, and the Prescience of God reaching <hi>in infinitum.</hi> But that of the <hi>longness</hi> of the time is mentioned upon the

affirming the thing to be <hi>true,</hi> not to obviate any diffidence of the <hi>truth</hi> thereof, though <hi>long,</hi> but it is given as a mark for the right application of the Prophecy to Historical Events. Of which, if <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> had taken notice, he would have been ashamed to confine his Historical Applications to the times of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> and the affairs of the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> and no farther.</p>

                        <hi>Vers</hi> 17. What befell <hi>Daniel</hi> here, was out of an astonishment at the Vision, as also <hi>Iohn</hi> fell at the feet of our Saviour as dead on his appearance to him, the frailty of humane nature being not able to bear the view of so terrible and glorious a Representation. Hence God tells <hi>Moses,</hi> that <hi>none could see his face and live</hi>; and the <hi>Israelites</hi> intreated that God should speak no more unto them from <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> lest they dye, and <hi>Manoah</hi> and his wife, on the Angel's ascend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the flame, fell on their faces; and he said, we shall dye because we have seen God. But such an exinanition as is here supposed for receiving Divine communications, cannot be signified, for he was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to receive them till he was revived and streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened from that liveless condition the Vision cast him into.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> What a fond and even prophane Cavil is this of the <hi>Remarker,</hi> against these Mystical or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral passages of the <hi>Expositor,</hi> upon what befell <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> before he received this noble and ample <hi>Vision</hi> of <hi>Truth</hi>? And how Pedantickly does he instruct him, touching the natural horrour and astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of mere Mortals upon the sight of the Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Powers, as if the <hi>Expositor</hi> were yet to learn that either out of the Scripture or other History, whenas he does plainly acknowledge the <hi>literal</hi>
                        <pb n="256" facs="tcp:48067:142"/>
sense, <hi>v.</hi> 18. besides the <hi>Moral</hi> Allegory, which are very well consistent together, nor exclude one the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? And it is a marvellous wise arguing in the <hi>Remarker,</hi> when he would prove that such an exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanition as is here supposed for receiving Divine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications, cannot be signified, because <hi>Daniel</hi> was dis-inabled from receiving them, till he was revived and strengthened from that liveless condition the Vision of these Angelical Powers had cast him into. But he seems so blind as wilfully not to see or take notice that this reviving was from a <hi>supernatural</hi> power, which had not been but upon a <hi>precedent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inanition,</hi> which made him capable of it. Which is a Symbol of the <hi>new life</hi> which <hi>revives</hi> not in us, till the <hi>selfish life</hi> be <hi>evacuated</hi> and <hi>abolished,</hi> till we be <hi>dead</hi> to it. Then the soul is fitted for Divine communications. But it seems the <hi>Expositor</hi> had the luck here to cast pearls before swine.</p>

                        <hi>Vers.</hi> 21. <hi>I will shew thee what is noted in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Truth</hi>; signifies, I suppose, no more than that I will more fully and plainly unfold to thee what hath formerly (though briefly and obscurely) been notified by the Prophets. For the words do plainly refer to other <hi>Writings,</hi> which are called <hi>Scriptures of Truth.</hi> But to make them signifie the declaring of the Divine counsel, in plain words, without Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bols, is an unaccountable distortion of them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> The Remarker is marvellously singular in this conceit, in understanding by the <hi>Scripture of Truth</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>] the prophetical Scriptures, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten before <hi>Daniel</hi> received this Prophecy. Whenas there is not one Interpreter that I could ever lay my hands on, or find mentioned by any, but they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand thereby onely what is <hi>decreed</hi> and <hi>recorded</hi> in
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:48067:142"/>
the <hi>Divine Mind.</hi> The standing Intellect of God, in which are described all the Laws and Decrees of his Providence, is that <hi>Writing</hi> or <hi>Book</hi> of God which is so often mentioned in the Bible. As <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. <hi>Blot me out of thy Book:</hi> and <hi>Psal.</hi> 56. <hi>Are not these things noted in thy Book?</hi> And <hi>Psal.</hi> 139. <hi>And in thy book were all my members written.</hi> And that <hi>Book</hi> represented to <hi>Iohn, sealed</hi> and <hi>unsealed,</hi> is but a <hi>Symbol</hi> of this <hi>Book</hi> or <hi>Writing,</hi> as I may so speak. And this <hi>Scripture of Truth</hi> in <hi>Daniel,</hi> in all likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood is the first ground of that Apocalyptick <hi>sealed</hi> and <hi>unsealed Book.</hi> If by the <hi>Scripture of Truth</hi> had been understood the various Prophecies of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent Prophets, it would have been said the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> not the <hi>Scripture</hi> of Truth. Besides, it will be hard to find all the things of this Prophecy any how written in the foregoing Prophets. But it is not worth the while to confute so groundless a Paradox, which is indeed an unaccountable Essay of a distor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted fancy. But to make the <hi>Scripture of Truth</hi> to signifie a declaration of the Divine counsel and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose in a <hi>plain way,</hi> without Enigmes, is no distortion at all of the sense of the words. But is most easie and natural as to one part, there being <hi>not one</hi> Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter but who has hit of it or approved it, that <hi>Scripture</hi> here signifies the <hi>Decree</hi> or <hi>Counsel</hi> of God. And that <hi>Truth</hi> in the style of <hi>Daniel</hi> signifies <hi>plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> in opposition to <hi>Aenigmaticalness,</hi> has been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved over and over again, and that it does particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly signifie so here, appears from <hi>chap.</hi> 11. <hi>vers.</hi> 2. <hi>And now will I shew thee the truth.</hi> As if none of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Visions were true till now. But the appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent sense is, Now will I communicate a <hi>plain</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy to thee, without any <hi>Aenigmatical</hi> Figures or
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:48067:143"/>
Involutions. Which therefore shews that the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Truth</hi> is particularly restrained to this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy here, and not understood of the Writings of the precedent Prophets at large, who abound with Enigmes or Parables. If the Angel in saying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now will I shew thee what is written in the Scripture of Truth, meant onely, I will shew thee what already is shewn in the Writings of the Prophets, it were a very sorry way of exciting attention in <hi>Daniel,</hi> who might have said to the Angel, It were a needless thing to give himself that trouble, if what he would predict was already predicted in the Prophetick Writings. So extravagant is the Remarker in this Remark.</p>

These two Kings meditating mischief in their hearts, seems to be against the <hi>Iews,</hi> and not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst one another, for that would not be so agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with their meeting then in a friendly way, and the words do import some mischief which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred in, and not mischiefs projected against one another. And the lyes they speak may then signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie what they say of the <hi>Iews</hi> by way of instigating one another against them. This sense will better than the other agree with the scope of the Vision (<hi>viz.</hi> to foretell what will befall the people of God) and also with the following words. But it shall not prosper, for yet the end shall be at the time appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that is, Notwithstanding such meditating the <hi>Iews</hi> Ruine, yet the end of their state shall not be till the time appointed.

                        <hi>Ans.</hi> These two Kings meditating mischief one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst another, when they pretend mutual friendship, though it be not agreeable to the Laws of friendship, yet it is to the nature and custome of Politick Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates, and the Prophecy predicts not what ought to be, but what would be. And the one being so am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:48067:144"/>
and covetous, the other so deeply injured, there was no likelihood that there was any real friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship betwixt them, but that all their caressing and complementing one another were imposture and lyes, as they are called in the Prophecy. And the scope of the Prophecy is sufficiently pursued without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storting this place from this natural sense <hi>Grotius</hi> and others have given it. For the feats of <hi>Antiochus</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Iews</hi> are fully declared afterwards. And for the following words, But it shall not prosper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The sense the <hi>Expositor</hi> has given agrees very well with this Hypothesis of <hi>Grotius.</hi> And besides, what mischief the King of the North meditated against the King of the South, did not prosper, as appears from <hi>v.</hi> 29, 30. But there is no mention of any Essay from the King of the South, against the people of God, which farther shews the Ineptness of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marker</hi>'s conceit, which he would substitute in the room of <hi>Grotius</hi> his judicious Interpretation. See also what the <hi>Expositor</hi> has writ, <hi>v.</hi> 35. on those words, Because it is yet for a time appointed, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring them with what he has wrote on the same words, <hi>v.</hi> 27.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vers.</hi> 39. The conceit of making Churches and Monasteries to be called <hi>strong Holds,</hi> seems very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from the intended sense of the Text. <hi rend="sup">a</hi> For they were no such Holds at all, farther than the craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Impostures of Priests did for their gain delude the people with a belief of their being so. And it was in a spiritual sense they were pretended to be such, which does not agree with the words in this and the precedent verse, they bearing a Martial sense. <hi rend="sup">b</hi> I take them therefore to be spoken in way of <hi rend="sup">c</hi> Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis on mentioning this strange God whom this
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:48067:144"/>
King should acknowledge, <hi>viz.</hi> That though the Laws of this strange God teach righteousness and peace (which are to flourish in his Kingdom) yet this King so acknowledging him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and honouring him with splendid superstitious devotions, shall notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing continue the same iron Kingdom as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (though mixt with Clay in the sense mentioned, <hi>Vis.</hi> 1.) <hi>viz.</hi> the same Kingdom of violence and war.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> Nothing was ever writ with more judgment, elegancy and solidity, in Explication of Prophecies, than what that excellent Interpreter Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> has writ on this and the foregoing verse. Which yet this conceited <hi>Remarker</hi> very superciliously calls a <hi>conceit,</hi> and says is very remote from the intended sense of the Text, when nothing is more congene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous thereto, the Prophecy intending to describe the State of the Church as to Religion and Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship in that space of the Time and Times, and half a Time, when the <hi>little Horn,</hi> which is this King of Pride, should rule the rost. And therefore we may be sure it will not omit to perstringe the Idolatry then sprung up, I mean the Pagano-christian Idolatry, or an Idolatry of a new Mode. For it is said of this King of Pride, <hi>v.</hi> 37. <hi>That he shall not regard the God of his Fathers,</hi> i. e. either none of the Pagan Gods, he shall regard none of them; or if you will, more particularly, he shall not regard that proper God of his Fathers, <hi>viz. Mars</hi>; whom <hi>Grotius</hi> would have understood by the red Dragon. Of which <hi>Mars, Romulus</hi> and <hi>Remus</hi> were born, and he is the special Presidentiary God of the <hi>Roman</hi> City and <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,</hi> as <hi>Grotius</hi> himself also will have it. This God of his Ancestors this King of Pride does not regard,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:48067:145"/>
but is one who with his Hierarchy professes Celibate, forbidding to marry, a single life for him and his Adherents being most sutable, and for their ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous designs; and preferring his own Politick ends before any God or Religion, it follows, <hi>v.</hi> 38. ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to a true, skilfull and faithfull account of the sense out of the Hebrew. <hi>Together with God he will in his place</hi> (or Temple where he is worshipped) <hi>honour the</hi> Mahuzzim (not <hi>Mars</hi> the proper God of his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors, but these new <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, as <hi>Mahuzzim</hi> may signifie from the Seventy's Translation, <hi>Psal.</hi> 31.3. these new <hi>Numina defensoria</hi> of his Empire) <hi>even with a God his fathers knew not</hi> (which is Christ) <hi>shall he honour them with gold, and silver, and pretious stones,</hi> &amp;c. This is the onely easie and genuine sense that can be made of the 38<hi>th</hi> verse. And it being thus plain to any unprejudiced eye, that these <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>huzzim</hi> are the <hi>Daemons</hi> that S. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. where he tells us that <hi>the Spirit has foretold <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly that those that forbid to marry,</hi> &amp;c. will bring in the worship of Daemons, (which express Prediction is no-where but here) and the degenerating Church looking upon the Relicks of Saints and their conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated Images (whose form of consecration does sometimes specifie their intended virtue against the Invasion of Enemies) to be the <hi>Defence</hi> of the City where they are, and the Saints themselves to be their <hi>Mahuzzim,</hi> their <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, or <hi>Martial</hi> and <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Defenders</hi> of the City, where Temples or other places are consecrated to them. What a groundless Cavil is this of the Remarker to except against Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s rendring the sense of this present verse thus, which is exquisitely according to the Hebrew, viz. <hi>And he shall make the Holds of the</hi> Mahuzzim
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:48067:145"/>
                        <hi>jointly to the foreign God,</hi> understanding it of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and Monasteries? For the <hi>Mahuzzim</hi> being once such <hi>Warlike Defenders,</hi> expressed so under that No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and their help being supposed to come from the places consecrated to them, what an easie and obvious Analogy is it to call those consecrated places <hi>strong Holds</hi> or <hi>Forts?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi rend="sup">a</hi> And the Prediction is not of what they would be in Reality, but what they would be thought and reputed. Which therefore is a foretelling of those delusions in the Church, under the reign of the King of Pride. That the people should put their trust and confidence in such vanities.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi rend="sup">b</hi> What the Remarker would substitute in lieu of this excellent account of Mr. <hi>Mede,</hi> is very frigid and jejune; it giving notice of nothing, but that the King of Pride will be for war as well as other Potentates, and so making him to honour the God of forces, he makes him still a worshipper of <hi>Mars,</hi> the God of his Ancestours, contrary to the Text. Besides, there is this other Incongruity in this conceit, in that this Prince of Pride is not a Sword-man, but <hi>Rex sacro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> and his power lyes merely in a manner (not in <hi>Martial</hi> forces and feats of Arms, but rather) in <hi>Magical</hi> Incantations and <hi>lying Miracles,</hi> and <hi>presti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious</hi> charming of people into such superstitions as make most for his own advantage, and such where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he has an hank upon the Empire, and deludes them with all deceiveableness of unrighteousness.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi rend="sup">c</hi> And as for the <hi>Antithesis</hi> in professing Christ, who is the <hi>Prince of Peace,</hi> and yet to be given to <hi>War:</hi> Is not the <hi>Antithesis</hi> at least as full when Christ came to introduce a pure divine Worship, to <hi>Worship the Father in spirit and in truth,</hi> that this King of
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:48067:146"/>
Pride has filled all with superstitious Rites and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries towards the <hi>Mahuzzim,</hi> the <hi>Daemons</hi> or <hi>deceased Saints</hi>? And lastly, there is another a more near, proper and immediate <hi>Antistoechy</hi> or Opposition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>Genius</hi> of this King of Pride and his Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours, in Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s way, they worshipping the God <hi>Mars</hi> in a gross Pagan secular sense, he the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>huzzim,</hi> which are as it were so many <gap reason="foreign">

Thy tydings out of the North is surely more likely to be meant of the <hi>Germans, Poles, Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covites,</hi> &amp;c. than of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> both because they are directly North of the <hi>Turks,</hi> whenas the <hi>Tartars</hi> are as much East as North of them, and also because the End here foretold against the <hi>Turks</hi> is more likely to be executed by the Christians than by those of the same Religion with the <hi>Turks,</hi> especially whenas it is sent upon them in reference to the advancement of Christianity, which is the occasion of its here being foretold.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> That the tydings out of the North is surely more likely to be meant of the <hi>Germans, Poles, Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covites,</hi> &amp;c. than of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> is spoke with more confidence than sound assurance of Reason. For the <hi>Tartars</hi> being North-East of the <hi>Turks,</hi> but much more properly North than the <hi>Persians</hi>; it is easie and natural to conceive, that the tydings out of the East being out of <hi>Persia,</hi> that the News of the Stirs in <hi>Tartary</hi> would be called the Tydings out of the North, the <hi>Tartars</hi> being a people so hugely more
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:48067:146"/>
North than the <hi>Persians.</hi> Any one that but casts his eye on a Map, will at first sight discern this. So that the <hi>Tartars</hi> having a capacity of an <hi>Eastern</hi> conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, as well as of a <hi>Northern,</hi> they will fit both the <hi>sixth Vial</hi> and the present passage of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy too, and therefore have a privilege above the <hi>Germans, Poles</hi> and <hi>Muscovites</hi> to make part of the Kings of the East, which the sixth <hi>Vial</hi> mentions. And by that time this comes to pass, the <hi>Mahometan</hi> and <hi>Pagan Tartars</hi> may be turned <hi>Christians</hi>; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>fresh</hi> Converts, may have more zeal and activity in the behalf of true Christianity than either <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, Poles</hi> or <hi>Muscovites.</hi> Besides, it is a mistake in the Remarker, that he surmises that it is the <hi>Turk</hi> that comes to his end, <hi>v.</hi> 45. when it is the King of Pride that comes to his end. For the Vision drives at him plainly from <hi>v.</hi> 36. to the very end of the Chapter. And this last verse <hi>Luther</hi> (in his Letter to Count <hi>Schlikius</hi>) <hi>And he shall come to his end, and none shall help him,</hi> interpreteth it of the Ruine of the Pope. The Letter is in <hi>Martinius Horzovinus</hi> his <hi>Collation</hi> of <hi>Huss</hi> and <hi>Luther,</hi> p. 118. And how absurd it would be to suppose the contrary, the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positor</hi> has signified in his Exposition of the last verse of this eleventh Chapter, which is needless here to repeat. I will onely here add to what is said there, that this Vision of the <hi>Scripture of Truth</hi> being for a <hi>long</hi> time, <hi>ch.</hi> 10. it is the more unlikely not to reach to the utter overthrow of the King of Pride, and that being so notable a Providence not to skip over it.</p>

                        <hi>Vers.</hi> 45. It's strange to run so far as old <hi>Rome</hi> for interpreting this verse, whenas it may be much better applied to new <hi>Rome.</hi> 1. For <hi>Constantinople</hi>
                        <pb n="266" facs="tcp:48067:147"/>
being seated in the point of a Promontory, between two great Seas, is much more properly said to be seated between two Seas than <hi>Rome,</hi> which is at a large distance from those Seas it is seated between, especially from one of them; and is no more seated between them than any other part of <hi>Italy.</hi> 2. Also the Title of <hi>glorious holy Mountain</hi> is much more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable to <hi>Constantinople</hi> than to <hi>Rome,</hi> because <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi> there setled, when by reason of the hatred he contracted for professing Christianity, he could a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide no longer at <hi>Rome</hi>; and also, because many Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours reigned there, who were zealous against the Idolatrous corruptions of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and many noted Councils also held there, in one of which under <hi>Constantinus Copronymus</hi> the Worship of Images was condemned as Idolatrous; And also, because be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Ruine of the Eastern Empire they separated from <hi>Rome</hi> for its corruptions. 3. And <hi>new Rome</hi> may farther be called so from what flourishing state Christianity shall be in there, after the ruine of the <hi>Turkish</hi> Empire, whenas <hi>old Rome</hi> shall have the same fate befall it with old <hi>Babylon,</hi> according to what is pronounced against it, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18. 4. Also it's plain that in <hi>new Rome</hi> the King of the North has placed the Tabernacles of his Palace, and the word <hi>Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle</hi> may be perhaps used, because of the following words, <hi>Yet shall he come to his end,</hi> viz. The <hi>Turks</hi> will not have a <hi>settled</hi> Empire there, but it will be destroy'd. 5. But whereas the planting the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of his Palace being related after the tydings out of the East and the North, seems to signifie what he shall doe at the end of his Empire, it may notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing be understood in the sense I have given. For after the describing of his Conquests, this planting
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:48067:147"/>
of his Tabernacles comes as an <hi>additional Character</hi> of him. Also the tydings out of the East and the North may respect not onely what shall befall him at the end of his Empire, but also his almost conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual conflicts, during his Empire, with the aforesaid Northern Countries, and with the <hi>Persians.</hi> 6. That the planting of his Tabernacle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> should signifie the taking of <hi>Rome</hi> by the <hi>Turk,</hi> and so fulfilling what is said of casting the Beast and false Prophet into a lake of fire, is not onely for the reasons aforesaid a groundless conceit, but also disagrees with what the same Pen writes on <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. For there onely the Remnant of the Beast and false Prophet unconverted are made to be cast into the lake of fire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And of the lake of fire, no account is there given, and better none than what is here given. For it's plain there, that the casting of the Beast and false Prophet into the lake of fire, and so extinguishing the We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern Empire, as it is there called, must be by the Army of the Rider of the white Horse, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently not by the <hi>Turks.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">7. <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s Prophecy of <hi>Tyre</hi> is no Type of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ (as is imagined) and so gives no countenance to the applying the words, [Glorious holy Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain] as here is done. Both his and <hi>Esay</hi>'s Prophecy of <hi>Tyre,</hi> as they are intermixt with their Prophecies of other neighbouring Nations, so there's no appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of their having any other meaning than what those other Prophecies have, <hi>viz.</hi> what concerns onely those Nations. And the reasons given to the contrary in <hi>Synopsis Prophetica,</hi> Book 2. ch. 16. are of no moment. 1. For <hi>Tyre</hi> is <hi>properly</hi> called an <hi>Harlot,</hi> and said to commit fornication with all the Kings of the Earth, by reason of the subtile deceits
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:48067:148"/>
and allurements with which Merchants and Trafick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers enveagle their customers. 2. And <hi>Tyre</hi> being forgotten seventy years, according to the days of one King (<hi>viz.</hi> of one Kingdom, as King is usually ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken) is plainly enough understood of the <hi>Babyloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Kingdom, which was to continue seventy years according to <hi>Ieremy</hi>'s Prophecy. And <hi>Tyre</hi> being taken and ruined by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> did continue so till the end of that Kingdom. 3. But the fansied Cabbalistical sense of those seventy years will soon vanish, by considering, first, that the Christian <hi>Caesars</hi> belong to the sixth, and not to the seventh Head, as is shewed in the Remarks. 4. And next that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian <hi>Rome,</hi> which is supposed to be Typified by <hi>Tyre,</hi> was not in being before the Christian Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, and therefore cannot be said to be forgotten, during their Time. 5. As to the description of the Prince of <hi>Tyre,</hi> for which he is supposed to represent some great Priest in the Church; first being threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the Death of the uncircumcised, is no more than what is threatned to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in <hi>Ezek.</hi> chap. 32. and is said to befall all the Princes there spoken of. 6. Next he is not said to be adorned, as is supposed, with the high Priest's vestments, but onely with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious stones, to signifie the perfection of beauty and splendour, which by great wisedom he had attained unto. 7. By reason whereof he is said to have been in <hi>Eden,</hi> the garden of God, in like sense as great Kings are called Trees of <hi>Eden</hi> in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> chap. 31.8. Then as to his being called <hi>anointed Cherub,</hi> and his being upon the <hi>Mountain of God,</hi> and <hi>walking in the midst of the stones of Fire</hi>; they all signifie the perfection mentioned in the next verse, which he had by wisedom arrived to, even to an <hi>Angelical</hi> state,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:48067:148"/>
comparable to the <hi>anointed Cherub</hi> and <hi>stones of Fire,</hi> &amp;c. 9. And being such, it's no wonder that the word <hi>Sanctuary</hi> should be applied to him, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it is so to <hi>Moab,</hi> Esay 16.12. So that in this Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of <hi>Tyre</hi> is set forth the height of perfection and glory that humane wisedom and industry could ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance a state unto. 10. Which though it was to so high a degree as is described, yet all (proceeding not from the Spirit of Holiness to make their works to be wrought in God) proved corruptible like unto all fleshly glory. 11. But to make all this Typical of Antichristian <hi>Rome,</hi> is a like Romantick conceit with the applying of a <hi>Moral Cabbala</hi> to the three first Chapters of <hi>Genesis.</hi> 12. For besides what is already said against the same, The Vision setting forth the perfection and glory of a <hi>secular</hi> Kingdom or Civil state, can but very incongruously thereby typifie an <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> state. But then all this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription being of what was real, and what <hi>Tyre</hi> by Pride and Iniquity of her Trafick fell from, will by no means be applicable to what was onely counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit in Antichristian <hi>Rome,</hi> and what by her corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and impostures she fell into. And as to the State of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church before her Apostacy, it being not then Antichristian, cannot be aimed at by what is Typical of the Antichristian Church; nor was its condition then such, as can so answer to the description of <hi>Tyre,</hi> as to be Typified by it. The words therefore [Glorious holy Mountain] having no countenance from the Vision of <hi>Tyre,</hi> or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reasons given for it to be applied to <hi>Rome,</hi> the doing of it is altogether unaccountable, unless it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from a disposition to give the old Gentleman at <hi>Rome</hi> a plaster for having broken his Head, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

And so is <hi>Rome</hi> situated, thorough which, if you draw a line to these two Seas, that line will touch each Sea as to sight, in the Map of <hi>Ortelius</hi> and <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemy,</hi> in the middle. Whenas <hi>Constantinople</hi> is not situated thus betwixt the middle parts of the <hi>Pontus Euxinus</hi> and <hi>Propontis,</hi> but rather at the West-end of the <hi>Euxine</hi> Sea, in which regard old <hi>Rome</hi>'s situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has much the advantage of New <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople.</hi> And considering the huge length of the two Seas, extended along each side of <hi>Italy,</hi> and the narrowness of the Land in comparison, he must have a wonderfull capricious fancy that does not presently acknowledge it very properly placed betwixt two Seas. And that other Towns in <hi>Italy</hi> are placed so as well as it, is but a fond allegation. whenas there are other Notes to restrain it to <hi>Rome</hi> alone. And there are other Towns besides <hi>Constantinople</hi> placed betwixt the <hi>Pontus Euxinus</hi> and the <hi>Propontis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And then secondly, for the Title of [Glorious holy Mountain] which is the main restraining Note of the place; The Hills of <hi>Rome</hi> are exceeding much more celebrated in History than the Hills of <hi>Constantinople.</hi> They are but rarely and faintly taken notice of in comparison. And for the <hi>Holiness</hi> of the place, if
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:48067:149"/>
it be to be gathered from the Holiness of Persons once there residing, what comparison is there betwixt that <hi>one</hi> Emperour <hi>Constantine,</hi> who, hated for his zeal for the Christian Religion, went to <hi>Byzantium</hi> (if <hi>Zosimus</hi> must be believed, who was no friend to the Christians) and S. <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>Paul,</hi> who dyed Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs at <hi>Rome</hi> for the profession of Christ, as also did a dozen Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> in succession after them, <hi>Eleutherius</hi> being the first that dyed in his bed? And yet after him also <hi>Cornelius, Lucius, Sixtus, Marcellinus, Marcellus</hi> and <hi>Miltiades</hi> dyed Martyrs also for the Christian Religion. And such was the eminent <hi>Holiness</hi> of the <hi>Primitive</hi> Bishops of <hi>Rome,</hi> that the <hi>Roman</hi> Bishop has born the Title thereof ever afterwards till this very day; As also their Church and Hierarchy, how appropriated the Title of Holiness is to them, all men know, and it will continue as long as they are; whenas the Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of <hi>Constantinople</hi> is extinct by the overflowing of the <hi>Turk,</hi> and therefore the <hi>Glorious holy Mountain</hi> can be no where but where this Title of <hi>Holiness</hi> does reside. And <hi>Prophecy</hi> being <hi>anticipatory History,</hi> uses the same phrase that History would do, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon speech does in the Age it points at: which is a consideration worth the Noting. And as for those many <hi>Constantinopolitan</hi> Emperours that were zealous against the Idolatrous corruptions of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; and Councils held there against the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of Images, there were more that complied with the <hi>Roman</hi> corruptions than that resisted them, and there were Councils there held as well for the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of Images as against it, and these prevailed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the former. Which therefore argues the place more polluted than holy. And even before the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:48067:150"/>
of <hi>Constantinople</hi> by the <hi>Turk,</hi> the Christians within at their devotions for success against him, are said to carry their holy Images in procession, as <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nardus Chiensis</hi> declares, then present in the City at the Siege, in his <hi>Narrative</hi> of the taking of <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> by the <hi>Turk</hi>; and <hi>Richerius</hi> also writes the same, lib. 4. <hi>De rebus Turcarum</hi>; and it being ever since possest by those Infidels, surely it has not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased the Holiness thereof. And the manner of the <hi>Greeks</hi> devotions then is a plain demonstration how little they had separated from the <hi>Roman</hi> Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions.</p>
                     <p>And thirdly, it is a sign the Remarker is hugely put to his shifts, when he is fain to eek out the Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of that City with what he presumes it will be after the destruction of the <hi>Turkish</hi> Empire, as if <hi>Rome</hi> and other Cities then may not be as holy as it. For that the material City of <hi>Rome</hi> shall be so utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ruined, is a rash conjecture of his own, the <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical Babylon</hi> not signifying a <hi>material</hi> City, but a <hi>Polity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And fourthly, That is the fondest argument of all for having <hi>New Rome</hi> understood in this passage of the Prophecy, because the <hi>Turk</hi> already has placed the Tabernacles of his Palace there, which is rather an argument against it. For the words import some <hi>new</hi> Acquist of his. Nor does <hi>Tabernacle</hi> (a conceit of the Remarker's) alway imply a flitting condition, otherwise the condition of the <hi>New Ierusalem</hi> would be such, because God then is said to place his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle amongst men. And the Particle [Yet] is [<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>] in the Hebrew, and may be as well translated [And] as [Yet] or rather better.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="273" facs="tcp:48067:150"/>Fifthly, And if we cannot be assured from the order and nature of things in this part of the Vision, that the acquiring of the possession of <hi>the glorious holy Mountain betwixt the two Seas,</hi> is after the news out of the East and out of the North, and the <hi>Turks</hi> trouble therefrom, and after his going forth upon this trouble of mind with great fury to destroy by war-like invasion, amongst which Invasions is the invading of the City betwixt two Seas, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it is impossible for any one to have the assured sense of any thing written. But take this unstrained, natural and necessary order of things; and suppose, with the Remarker, that the City betwixt the two Seas is <hi>Constantinople,</hi> which is the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of the <hi>Turkish</hi> Empire; where, for the more distinctness, we will suppose him residing, and to hear the disturbing news from the East and North, and to go out of <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> with great fury to destroy many; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst other Acquists by War to take <hi>Constantinople,</hi> of which he is supposed all the while possest, and which cannot by any means now be supposed to bear the Title of Holy: Can there any thing be more ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous and incongruous than this? And that is a very lame, slim put-off to say, This taking of the City betwixt two Seas is added onely as a character of the <hi>Turk.</hi> For he was sufficiently characterized over and over again by his other Atchievements. And being it is said, that after the News out of the East, and out of the North, he shall plant the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles of his Palace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it is evident that that atchievement was to come after; that is to say, After he had taken <hi>Aegypt,</hi> v. 43. whenas he had taken <hi>Constantinople</hi> before included in that general over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing of the King of the North, <hi>v.</hi> 40. according,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:48067:151"/>
as the <hi>Expositor</hi> there has hinted, and he is now pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed of it. For in that 40<hi>th</hi> verse the general over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slowing of the King of the North is comprized. But <hi>v.</hi> 41. there is particularized his being made Master of the glorious Land <hi>Palestine</hi> or <hi>Iudaea,</hi> and <hi>v.</hi> 42, 43. of <hi>Aegypt</hi> and other Countries which he took af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Constantinople:</hi> Thus exquisitely Methodical is the frame of the Prophecy. Nor can such confusion as the Remarker would have, be admitted under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of more fully characterizing the <hi>Turk</hi> when he was sufficiently characterized already. And now I hope the Remarker will not think it so strange, that the <hi>Expositor</hi> ran so far as <hi>Old Rome</hi> for a right In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of this verse, when pitching the sense upon <hi>New Rome</hi> would make it intolerable Nonsense. And therefore to proceed.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, New <hi>Rome</hi> being so utterly uncomplia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with the scope of the Prophecy, the taking Old <hi>Rome</hi> here by the <hi>Turk</hi> is no groundless conceit, but <hi>apparently rational,</hi> though but <hi>conjectural.</hi> Nor does it at all disagree with what the <hi>Expositor</hi> has delivered upon <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. where the overthrow of the Beast and false Prophet is attributed to the courage and conduct of that Illustrious Heros on the white Horse, with a sword coming out of his mouth. For the Influence of that Evangelical Arme (by virtue of whose preaching the Kings of the East, <hi>Tartars</hi> and <hi>Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> suppose, by that time may be converted, <hi>viz.</hi> within the seventh Vial) may bring to pass such things as may thus disturb the mind of the <hi>Turk,</hi> and make him make such Incursions into Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, that at last he may attack <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> it self, and plant the Tabernacles of his Palace there according to the scope of the Prophecy. So that we
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:48067:151"/>
see how the overthrow of the Beast and false Prophet may be ascribed both to the Army of the Rider of the white Horse, and to the <hi>Turk</hi> also, that Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God that comprizeth all, attempering the affairs of the World to such ends as he has foreseen and foretold by the mouth of his holy Prophets. But it is a <hi>childish</hi> and <hi>Idiotick</hi> conceit to fansie that Army of the Rider of the white Horse to be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of men at one time gathered into one place, or that the Kings of the Earth will be in such sort ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered; but what is more scatteredly and interrupted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done as to <hi>time,</hi> and <hi>place,</hi> and <hi>parties,</hi> is accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the uniting and constringing nature of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick <hi>Henopoeia,</hi> represented as done at one time, and in one place, and by one set-battel betwixt the parties there congregated. And he that is not aware of the <hi>Genius</hi> of the <hi>Prophetick style</hi> in such cases, will make strange work in the Interpretation of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, The <hi>Remarker</hi>'s affirming that <hi>Esay</hi>'s and <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s Prophecy of <hi>Tyre</hi> is no Type of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, is more sullen than sound; the reason he brings for it being so small and evanid, <hi>viz.</hi> because the Kings or Princes of other places in the adjoining Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies are not made Types of Antichrist. But why should this be expected more than that all the good Kings of <hi>Israel</hi> should be made Types of Christ? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, how does the <hi>Remarker</hi> prove but that King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <hi>Pharaoh</hi> is made a Type of Antichrist, <hi>Ezek.</hi> ch. 32. Of which we shall say more anon. But there is a special reason to believe the King of <hi>Tyre</hi> to be a Type of Antichrist, the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> borrowing so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny entire phrases out of the Visions of <hi>Tyre</hi> in the Lamentation over <hi>Babylon,</hi> which most certainly
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:48067:152"/>
signifies the Pontifician Polity. Which is a fair indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to any ordinary unprejudiced sagacity that <hi>Tyre</hi> is intimated a Type of the same Polity that <hi>Babylon</hi> is. And the expressions are so high, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime and grandisonant (which is ridiculous to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to be levelled onely at a mere rich cunning Merchant) that several ancient Fathers, as S. <hi>Ierome,</hi> S. <hi>Austin, Origen, Beda, Ambrose</hi> and <hi>Tertullian</hi> have thought it a <hi>Prophetick Parable</hi> touching the <hi>Devil</hi>; but others more moderate, as <hi>Apollinarius</hi> and <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doret</hi> understood some things therein, of the Prince of <hi>Tyre,</hi> others of the Devil. And so that which is said <hi>Esay</hi> 14.12. How art thou fallen from Heaven, <hi>Lucifer,</hi> thou Son of the Morning, <hi>Origen, Eusebius, Ambrose, Athanasius,</hi> and most of the Ancients un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood it of the <hi>Devil</hi>; but S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> to give him his due, understood <hi>Antichrist</hi> by it. And it is plain from the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> that by the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> is understood <hi>Antichrist.</hi> Wherefore where there is the like exorbitant sublimity of style as there is here toward the Prince of <hi>Tyre,</hi> a meaner person than the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> (being but as it were an huge wealthy cunning Merchant, and a Prince over such) surely some greater thing or person than the Prince of <hi>Tyre</hi> must be understood; and it being not to be understood of the <hi>Devil,</hi> who can claim a juster right to be signified by the Prophecy in the full sense there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, than <hi>Antichrist</hi> himself? But particular reasons are farther given in Book 2. Chap. 16. <hi>Synopsis Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetica,</hi> which the <hi>Remarker</hi> pretends to confute, to which Confutations I will answer in order as they occur.</p>
                     <p>First then, Methinks he begins very inauspiciously to make <hi>cunning Traficking,</hi> properly <hi>Whoredom.</hi> Let
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:48067:152"/>
him produce any <hi>Lexicographer</hi> that will tell us that <hi>Traficking</hi> signifies <hi>Whoring</hi> in any approved Authour, sacred or profane, and a farther answer shall be fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. In the mean time to one that will say any thing, it is fit to answer nothing. <hi>Cunning Trafick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> may be akin to <hi>thieving</hi>; but how it is to sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Whoring, I see not.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The seventy years <hi>Tyre</hi> is forgotten, and lyes in Ruines, cannot be understood of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty years of the <hi>Babylonish</hi> Kingdom. For then <hi>Tyre</hi> should be taken in the beginning of <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar</hi>'s reign, whenas it was not taken by him till the 4136 year of the <hi>Iulian</hi> Period, which is about 30 years from the beginning of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as you may see in <hi>Petavius</hi> his <hi>De Doctrina Temporum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, What a vain conceit it is to make the Christian <hi>Caesars</hi> part of the sixth <hi>Head</hi> of the Beast, I have shewn upon his foregoing <hi>Remarks.</hi> To make them part of the sixth <hi>Head,</hi> is to make them <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous,</hi> which is a perfect contradiction to the Vision, which makes eight <hi>Kings</hi> but onely seven <hi>Heads</hi> of the Beast, and all of them <hi>Idolatrous.</hi> Wherefore one of these eight Kings must not be Idolatrous, which were the Primitive Christian <hi>Caesars,</hi> who were the seventh <hi>King</hi> of the eight.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>Rome</hi> was Idolatrous before it was Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, and turned Idolatrous again when it became Paganochristian, and Whoredom is the true Symbol of Idolatry known to all; wherefore the Harlot, though she was silent awhile in the time of the pure Christian <hi>Caesars,</hi> which were the seventh King, yet when that time expired, she might sing again like a Harlot. Nor does this at all hinder but that this
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:48067:153"/>
Vision is Typical of <hi>Rome-Antichristian,</hi> this stroke setting out more exquisitely the Paganochristianism of their Idolatry, that they <hi>Paganize</hi> again, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain play the Harlot by a new Mode of Idolatry, which yet is the lively Image of the Idolatry of old <hi>Paganism.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fifthly, As for <hi>Pharaoh</hi> his being threatened with the death of the uncircumcised, we being taught out of the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> that by <hi>Aegypt</hi> is understood the Pontifician Hierarchy, he must be of a slow sense that does not discern that Prophecy of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> chap. 32. v. 19. to concern the Papal Hierarchy, which pretending to be <hi>Holy Church</hi> in a special manner, and that this <hi>Papal Polity</hi> is that Kingdom of Christ that shall <hi>abide for ever,</hi> which is the privilege onely of the <hi>Millennial</hi> Empire of Christ, the Prophet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braids that confidence to this <hi>Roman Pharaoh,</hi> as if he were more <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>pure</hi> than other worldly Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates, and therefore says expresly, <hi>Whom dost thou pass in Beauty? Go down and be thou laid with the uncircumcised.</hi> Thou shalt perish as well as other Heathen or Pagan Polities. If there were not some such weighty sense as this under it, it is incredible that <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s lying down in Death with the uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised, should be so often repeated in this Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. He is reckoned amongst that long list of uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised Potentates, whose Empires failed, and so must his, though he thinks himself in such a special manner a <hi>circumcised</hi> one, and to be that <hi>Christian</hi> Kingdom which shall never fail.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, That the Prince of <hi>Tyre</hi> is described as adorned with the High Priest's Vestments, is evident from hence; in that of all the nine pretious stones which are named, there is not one of them but what
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:48067:153"/>
is in the High Priest's Breast-plate; but to have na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med all twelve had been too bare for the nature of a Prophecy of this kind, and too sorry a conceit it would be to fansie the Breast-plate without the other cloathing. And his naming a little after the <hi>anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Cherub,</hi> shews that the Prophet's fancy was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into the Temple (into the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum</hi>) and to the High Priest, who alone had power to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thereinto.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, And as to his being said to be in <hi>Eden,</hi> the Garden of God, that ill sutes with the City of <hi>Tyre,</hi> built on a hard steril Rock; whenas <hi>Italy,</hi> the seat of the Sacerdotal Prince chiefly aimed at, is by Geographers and Historians acknowledged to be the very <hi>Paradise</hi> of <hi>Europe.</hi> Nor does the Remarker mend himself by making the Prince of <hi>Tyre</hi> the tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest Cedar in the garden of God, by referring to <hi>Ezek.</hi> 31. For that example of the King of <hi>Assyria</hi> is brought in onely to set out the high Sovereignty and Magnificency of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> who is a Type of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> that exalteth himself above all that is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led God or is worshipped. It is a Parable taken up against him. And therefore <hi>v.</hi> 18. it is said, <hi>Thou shalt lye in the midst of the uncircumcised</hi> (for all thy pretended Holiness) <hi>with them that be slain with the sword. This is Pharaoh and all his multitude, saith the Lord God.</hi> The whole Parable of the King of <hi>Assyria</hi> is understood of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and consequently of the <hi>Papal Hierarchy,</hi> and it does lively set out the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, but it would take up too much room to give an account of it here.</p>
                     <p>Eighthly, There must be a strange thick callosity on the <hi>perceptive</hi> faculty of that man that can dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern no more by those expressions, <hi>The anointed
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:48067:154"/>
Cherub, The Holy Mountain of God, The walking up and down in the midst of the stones of fire,</hi> viz. cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Vestments of <hi>Aaron,</hi> as was above noted, than the signification of, forsooth, an <hi>Angelical</hi> state (as if the <hi>Angels</hi> in Heaven were <hi>anointed Cherubs,</hi> whenas it plainly refers to the <hi>Cherubim</hi> in the <hi>Sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum Sanctorum,</hi> which were anointed and consecrated) of an high and mighty <hi>Merchant</hi> with a company of his cunning Traders and Trafickers, if not <hi>blew-apron</hi> men, grown rich and wealthy by their worldly craft and subtilty, nothing less than the most holy things in the Temple of God must set out the greasie glory of these fat Burgomasters, and their worldly splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour and prosperity, arising from their over-reaching arts in Trafick, and the thence issuing sordid gain. What a homely course conceit is this?</p>
                     <p>Ninthly, As for the name <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> being applied to <hi>Moab,</hi> the word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, which is in both places, is of a general signification, and signifies any consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted place, whether it be to the God of <hi>Israel,</hi> the true God, or otherwise. But that <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> here respects the true God, and alludes to the <hi>Sanctuary</hi> of the God of <hi>Israel,</hi> and therefore denotes some high and mighty Priest principally, not a worldly, though princely Merchant, the <hi>anointed Cherub,</hi> the <hi>holy Mountain of God,</hi> and the <hi>Vestments of Aaron,</hi> a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before mentioned, do naturally indicate, and that the fancy of the Prophet had not withdrawn it self from the Temple at <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> The allusion to whose most holy things to conceive to be merely to set out the worldly prosperity of a City of subtile cheating Merchants; as also to conceive, that the comparing of the Wisedom of the Prince of <hi>Tyre</hi> with that of <hi>Daniel,</hi> and making the <hi>Tyrian</hi> Prince
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:48067:154"/>
prefer his own before it, doth denote onely his cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in Trading, and not some person that has more resemblance to the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> as pretending himself also to be a Prophet, though characterized in the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> to be a false one, is most absurd and ridiculous. But it is too long to insist on these things. And therefore</p>
                     <p>Tenthly, What the Remarker says, That this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>Tyrian</hi> state proceeding not from the Spirit of Holiness proved corruptible; this, I suppose, he col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects from <hi>v.</hi> 15. <hi>Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day thou wast created, till Iniquity was found in thee.</hi> But if this be all that is meant by this Vision, that humane Polities, be they never so well ordered at first, if there be no more than what is humane, will in process of time corrupt; besides, that it is so obvious and trivial a Notion, it is not the Object of Prophecy. Wherefore for the Prophet to make such a stir about so small a business, is a supposition incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible. And therefore this perfect state, that is to say, this upright and honest state, as well as beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and glorious of the Prince of <hi>Tyre,</hi> is a real pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the state of the Primitive Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> especially, even till the Apostasie came in. And the words of this 15<hi>th</hi> verse sound so high, that S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin, Gregory</hi> and other Theologers conceive they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to <hi>Lucifer,</hi> who was created perfect, but fell through his own Pride. These rich and glorious descriptions therefore taken from the most holy things of the Temple, respect the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> especially, and their Hierarchy before the Time of the Apostasie, till Iniquity was found in them. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but wilfull blindness, or a skew conceit against Episcopacy, as if the Remarker were a Presbyterian,

which yet I do not believe, can hinder a man from seeing so clear a Truth.</p>
                     <p>Eleventhly, As for the <hi>Moral Cabbala</hi> on the three first Chapters of <hi>Genesis,</hi> it is a natural and coherent Application of the most sapid and weighty parts of a <hi>Divine Morality.</hi> And let him take heed that he is not guilty (in an high degree) of an Insensibility of such things that will adventure to call that <hi>Cabbala</hi> a <hi>Romance.</hi> But this was pluck't in by the head and shoulders by the <hi>Remarker,</hi> and haply might as well have been omitted as answered by the <hi>Answerer.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Twelfthly, It is extreme precariously affirmed by the <hi>Remarker,</hi> That the Perfections and Imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a <hi>Civil</hi> state may not Typifie the Perfections and Imperfections of a state <hi>Ecclesiastical,</hi> and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially as to some particular point. As this Vision of the Prince of <hi>Tyre</hi> is taken notice of in <hi>Synopsis Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetica,</hi> for a Prediction of Ecclesiastical <hi>Nundinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> Wherefore this <hi>Tyrian</hi> Polity, they being a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Merchants, and being for a time honest and upright, and not adulterating their Wares, nor using any fraud or couzenage may be a Type of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive unapostatized State of the Church, while her Merchandize was pure and uncorrupt. For there is a <hi>spiritual</hi> as well as a <hi>secular</hi> Merchandize, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by that of <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 3.14. <hi>For the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize of wisedom is better than the Merchandize of silver,</hi> &amp;c. And the salutiferous Wisedom of the Gospel better than all other Wisedoms. And our Saviour Christ says, <hi>The Kingdom of God is like a Merchant-man, seeking goodly Pearls,</hi> Mat. 13. And the goodly Pearl indeed that exceeds all other Pearls, is pure Evangelical Truth, unsophisticate with any noxious errour. This was the Merchandize of the
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:48067:155"/>
Primitive Church and of the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> while he continued perfect in his ways from the day God created him, that is, constituted him Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> till Iniquity was found in him. Till <hi>he defiled his Sanctuaries by the multitude of his Iniquities, by the Iniquity of his Trafick,</hi> bringing in many Institutes and Doctrines Antichristian and repugnant to the pure Evangelical Truth of Christ; and all this for filthy lucre and worldly Interest. What an easie Type is <hi>Tyre</hi> here, though a <hi>Civil</hi> State of a State <hi>Ecclesiastick?</hi> But I am even weary of making out such plain things. What follows is refuted already by this and by my fourth Answer. And I have been too long already. It is sufficiently clear out of what has been said, that <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s Prophecy of <hi>Tyre</hi> is a Type of Antichrist, and consequently does give countenance to the applying the words [Glorious holy Mountain] to Antichrist himself or his seat, as well as the most holy things in the Temple, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to <hi>Aaron,</hi> are applied in <hi>Ezekiel</hi> to the Prince of <hi>Tyre,</hi> Antichrist his Type.</p>
                     <p>As for that passage of the <hi>Remarker</hi>'s rare wit in the close of all, I onely answer this thereto, That the <hi>Expositor</hi> takes no pleasure in breaking any ones Head of what quality soever, nor has any such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention any where, or of administring any palliating Plasters. But if he had any Sovereign <hi>Cephalick,</hi> or <hi>Medicated</hi> Cap that would corroborate and cleanse the Brain, and clear the Judgment, I do not doubt but he wishes so well to the <hi>Remarker,</hi> that he would bestow it on him, whereby he might be the better inabled to discern the solidity and congruity of other mens conceptions, and the Absurdities and Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruities of his own. If he had in his understanding
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:48067:156"/>
the last verse [Yet he shall come to his end, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] of the destruction of the <hi>Turk</hi> conjoined it with his pitching the Tabernacles of his Palace on Mount <hi>Sion</hi> and Mount <hi>Moriah</hi> in expectation of the Kings of the East, the return of the <hi>Israelites</hi> to their own Land, as Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> seems to intimate, there had been better sense in it; but to join the destruction of the <hi>Turk</hi> with his pitching the Tabernacles of his Palace in New <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Constantinople,</hi> is very absonous and ridiculous. But whether Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s way, or the <hi>Expositor</hi>'s way, be the better, Time onely will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly discover.</p>

And that Earthquake signifies the great Astonishment the victory then will cause, and the great Revolution which will ensue thereon. Which sense is confirmed by the following words, <hi>And at that time shall thy people be delivered,</hi> viz.

                        <hi>Ans.</hi> The time of trouble, and the time of the great Earthquake are assuredly the same, <hi>viz.</hi> the Time of War, and destruction which Earthquakes signifie in the Prophetick style, and according to <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temidorus</hi> and <hi>Achmetes.</hi> Wherefore the Earthquake cannot be after the Victory, or signifie any Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then, but signifies the battel it self and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction thereby.

                        <hi>Vers.</hi> 2. If the words [Some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt] respect the first Resurrection (as they seem to doe) then surely the awaking to shame and contempt must in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend a state in the other life, as well as the awaking to everlasting life does so. And the words [shame and contempt] seem apt to signifie what is likely then to befall them, when the faithfulness of God's
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:48067:157"/>
promises and threatenings to reward the righteous and punish evil doers, will be made so manifest.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> If we had nothing but the English Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to go by, or other Translations like it, what the <hi>Remarker</hi> says may seem rational enough; but if we have recourse to the Hebrew, and withall consider the phrases of [shame and contempt] the <hi>Expositor</hi>'s account seems more rational, though, as I have above noted, on the <hi>Remarks,</hi> he is not averse from admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this sense of the <hi>Remarker</hi>'s also.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vers.</hi> 7. The words <hi rend="sup">a</hi> [scatter the power of the holy People] are surely meant of the Christians or adopted, as well as of the natural <hi>Iews,</hi> and do more respect them than the other. <hi rend="sup">b</hi> But it's strange that the words [all these things shall be finished] <hi>viz.</hi> an accomplishing to scatter the power, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> should be made to signifie, <hi>All these marvellous things to the first and second Resurrection,</hi> whenas they plainly mean the wonders that are to last for a time, and times, and half a time, <hi>viz.</hi> the preceding wonders of scattering the power of the holy people, which will then be accomplished or finished.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> The words <hi rend="sup">a</hi> [scatter the power of the holy People] are certainly understood of the <hi>Iews.</hi> But that they are meant of others also, if the <hi>Remarker</hi> had any reasons so to think, he should have produced them. <hi rend="sup">b</hi> And that [all these things shall be finished] are not to be restrained to the wonders that are to last for a time, and times, and half a time, is plain from hence, in that it is repugnant to the Text, which runs thus: <hi>And when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people, all these things shall be finished</hi>; that is according to the <hi>Remarker,</hi> all the wonders during the time, and times, and half
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:48067:157"/>
a time. Which then will imply, that the Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishing to scatter the power of the holy people pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes those wonders, which is grosly false. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, All these things shall be finished, includes both those wonders, and the accomplishing to scatter the holy people, and whatever else has been hinted of the New <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and the first and second Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. After which immediately occurs, <hi>v.</hi> 6. the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion of the Angel. How long shall it be to the end of these wonders? And therefore [all these things] take in all before. And <hi>Daniel</hi> tells us, <hi>ch.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 1. that the time appointed was long. And the Oath of the Apocalyptick Angel, and the Oath of this Angel here in <hi>Daniel</hi> surely swear touching the same end of the Periods of Time, <hi>viz.</hi> that besides the Time, and Times, and half a Time, there shall be no more time than the Interval of the <hi>seventh Trumpet,</hi> which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to the <hi>Conflagration.</hi> See the <hi>Expositor</hi> upon this verse.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vers.</hi> 11, 12. Though the meaning here given of 1290 and 1335 days may be intended, yet I suppose there is also another meaning which seems to be chiefly aimed at, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. That as <hi>Antiochus Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> did Typifie Antichrist, so by the taking away the daily Sacrifice is signified the beginning of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian Reign, and so those Numbers will have the same <hi>Epocha</hi> with the Time, and Times, and half a Time, or 1260 days. 2. This sense will much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter agree with the Reckoning by Indictions (which began but about <hi>Constantine</hi>'s time) than the other. 3. And also does give a much more agreeable Answer to the Question, <hi>v.</hi> 8. <hi>What shall be the end of these things?</hi> Which does second the question, <hi>v.</hi> 6. <hi>How long shall it be to the end of these wonders?</hi> and so is
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:48067:158"/>
meant of those wonders that are to last for a time, and times, and half a time, and does enquire what shall be the end of them. Which the first sense of the Numbers gives no apt answer to, telling onely what shall fall out towards the end of those wonders. But this other sense gives an apt, though not a satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory answer thereto, telling <hi>Daniel,</hi> that as he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood not the words <hi>Time and Times,</hi> &amp;c. which answered his first Question, the meaning of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing closed till the time of the End, so what he far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enquires is also concealed till then. But at the end of the 1290 and 1335 days (beginning them, as aforesaid, with the 1260 days) there will those things fall out as will give a satisfactory account of what he enquires after, and make them peculiarly blessed who reach those times. 4. So that whereas the end of 1260 days does signifie a time wherein the scattering of the power of the holy people will be ended, and they wholly delivered from the bondage and evils they suffered; 5. The end of the other Numbers signifies Times, wherein a great advancement will be towards the glorious state of the <hi>Millennium.</hi> 6. For though it be one simple uniform state, yet it may be a considerable time growing to the height of it. 7. With which seems to agree, <hi>Zech.</hi> 14.6, 7. <hi>In that day the light shall not be clear, nor dark, not day nor night, but in the evening it shall be light.</hi> Which signifies that those times will still be more refined to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end of them, which is most agreeable with their being to end with a Translation into an Heavenly state. So far will they be from degenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting into a <hi>Laodicean</hi> state.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> That Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s Interpretation of these two Numbers is the onely true Interpretation, and that
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:48067:158"/>
the <hi>Remarker</hi>'s Interpretation, though it has some shew of ingeniousness in it, is groundless, I shall shew by shewing the weakness of his reasons for it. For,</p>
                     <p>First, it does not follow because <hi>Antiochus Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> is a Type of Antichrist, that therefore by the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away the daily Sacrifice, is signified the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Antichristian Reign, so that it must have the same <hi>Epocha</hi> the 1260 days have. For <hi>chap.</hi> 8. the 2300 days which are said to be the time of the cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the daily Sacrifice and Pollution of the Sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary caused by <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> making both these days and <hi>Antiochus</hi> Typical of Antichrist, and to point at the continuance of his once begun Pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, yet the <hi>Epocha</hi> of those Prophetical days or 2300 years is not the <hi>Epocha</hi> of the 1260 years of the reign of Antichrist, but from the beginning of the <hi>literal</hi> Pollution of the <hi>Sanctuary.</hi> Which yet might better have been there than here in these Numbers of 1290 and 1335. Because it is expresly said here, That <hi>from the time that the daily Sacrifice shall be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and the abomination that maketh desolate set up, there shall be</hi> 1290 <hi>days,</hi> &amp;c. So that the <hi>Epocha</hi> is set to us here, when it was free in the other place; and yet not there neither is the <hi>Epocha</hi> the same with the <hi>Epocha</hi> of the reign of Antichrist. It is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient there that the <hi>days</hi> be <hi>Typical</hi> of <hi>years,</hi> though the <hi>Epocha</hi> of them be not the <hi>Epocha</hi> of the Reign of Antichrist, of whom <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi> is a Type. For were it so, the Reign of Antichrist would conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue above a thousand years longer. And lastly, it may be considered whether the express fixing the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocha</hi> of the Numbers 1290 and 1335 on the taking away the daily Sacrifice, may not be set down on purpose to be a guide to us, where to fix the <hi>Epocha</hi>
                        <pb n="290" facs="tcp:48067:159"/>
of the Number 2300 days, supposing it also Typical of years, and to indigitate to what time the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian Pollution will reach, having once begun, and so point at the end of it, as the other does at the height of it.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Though the two Numbers consist of Indictions, yet there is no betterness in the <hi>Remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi>'s way than in Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s way, both because the beginning of <hi>Constantine</hi>'s Indictions was about an hundred years before the <hi>Epocha</hi> of the 1260 Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Days, as is plain out of <hi>Petavius</hi> and <hi>Sigonius,</hi> so that they could give no aim at that <hi>Epocha,</hi> and also that it is sufficient that they point to the times in which these Indictions were in use, that no man might fansie them to be <hi>literal</hi> Days, not <hi>prophetical</hi>; and also, that may give a latitude of compute by <hi>Quindenaries</hi> of Fifteens, and not bind the event of the Prophecy to a strict Prophetical day.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Nor does this way give a much more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable answer to the question, <hi>v.</hi> 8. [What shall be the end of these things?] which does fecond the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion <hi>v.</hi> 6. For the question, <hi>v.</hi> 6. is manifestly of all the wonders from <hi>v.</hi> 36. of the precedent Chapter, to <hi>v.</hi> 5. of this. Upon all this matter the question is put, <hi>v.</hi> 6. How long shall it be to the end of these wonders? Amongst which is the New <hi>Ierusalem</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated, and the first and second <hi>Resurrection.</hi> And therefore the answer of him that sweareth by him that liveth for ever, reacheth to that extent, and endeth with—<hi>All these things shall be finished</hi>; that is, even to the second <hi>Resurrection.</hi> And this I think is a very pertinent and satisfactory answer to that question, which was, <hi>How far to the end of those wonders?</hi> And his Answer is, to the end of the
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:48067:159"/>
World. As I noted above, that <hi>Daniel</hi> said, <hi>The Time appointed was long.</hi> But here now, <hi>v.</hi> 8. <hi>Daniel,</hi> to whom it was said, <hi>v</hi> 4. <hi>But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book even to the Time of the end</hi> (which phrase denotes the fourth Monarchy) is made to ask this question (understanding nothing by the question of one of the two Angels, and the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer of <hi>Palmoni</hi> thereto) <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. What the latter part of those times which was called the time of the end? For so <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> signifies. Which place, because our English renders, <hi>What shall be the end of these things</hi>? the <hi>Remarker</hi> understands what shall be the End or <hi>success</hi> of them: which is a mistake. But the genuine sense is, What is the <hi>latter part</hi> of those Times, which are called the Time of the End? by which is understood the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy. And then, though <hi>Daniel</hi> was no wiser than he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, who is bid to go his way, for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the End (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you take it in a more restrict sense, or in the same it is taken, <hi>v.</hi> 4.) yet those two Numbers from the <hi>Epocha</hi> given, <hi>v.</hi> 11, 12. do most plainly and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactorily answer to the question, and evidently point at those <hi>latter times</hi> of the <hi>Time of the End,</hi> or last <hi>Monarchy,</hi> which is the <hi>Roman, viz.</hi> at the <hi>Time, and Times, and half a Time,</hi> which by S. <hi>Paul</hi> are called <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, the latter Times of the last. Which is of very weighty use for the discovery of the Times of Antichrist. But the <hi>Remarker</hi>'s way leads the heedless into groundless hopes of such an Acceleration of the <hi>Millennium,</hi> as to any prudent and knowing man must seem incredible. And flesh and bloud had rather be blessed by reaching into the prosperous times of the Church on Earth, than
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:48067:160"/>
be peculiarly happy in the other state, by suffering Martyrdom here.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, I deny that the End of the 1260 days does signifie a time wherein the scattering of the power of the holy people will be ended, forasmuch as the <hi>Vials</hi> follow the 1260 days, and do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede them, nor are they poured out till the <hi>Rising</hi> of the <hi>Witnesses.</hi> And therefore,</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, It is impossible that these two Numbers in this Chapter, from the <hi>Epocha</hi> of the Reign of Antichrist should reach into those times wherein the glory of the <hi>Millennium</hi> is more advanced. And,</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, I say it is a mere surmise of the Remarker to make the proper <hi>Millennial</hi> state so dim and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, and contrary to the description in the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calypse,</hi> which makes the state of the <hi>New Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> so soon as it is settled exceeding glorious. When once the <hi>New Ierusalem</hi> is descended, and the <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lennium</hi> begun, the glory will be so excellent, that it is not probable that the <hi>Intention</hi> of it will increase but onely the <hi>Extension,</hi> more people being Prosely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to it. And,</p>
                     <p>Seventhly and lastly, As for that place of <hi>Zechary, chap.</hi> 14.6, 7. If it respect the state of the Christian Church, as <hi>Grotius</hi> declines it, yet how does it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that it is understood of the <hi>Millennial</hi> Times, and not rather of the Times <hi>before</hi>; The <hi>Millennium</hi> being the <hi>latter</hi> part of the <hi>Day</hi> of the Gospel, and therefore more fitly answering to the <hi>Evening,</hi> and also a time of much more light, glory and prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty than the times before, which may answer to those words of the Prophecy, <hi>But in the evening it shall be light.</hi> But if it must respect the <hi>Millennium,</hi>
                        <pb n="293" facs="tcp:48067:160"/>
as the <hi>Remarker</hi> would have it, the most natural sense of the Original makes plainly against him. For, <hi>v.</hi> 6. the Hebrew runs thus: And it shall come to pass in that day, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <p>THE Comparison here betwixt <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the Visions of the <hi>Opened book,</hi> and the Inference therefrom is an <hi>elaborate, insig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant</hi> Argument. <hi rend="sup">a</hi> For the two first Visions of <hi>Daniel</hi> running through the four Monarchies, and the transition from each Monarchy to the other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing here called <hi>Ioints,</hi> if a succeeding Vision prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie but of the <hi>three</hi> first of those Monarchies it must of <hi>necessity</hi> end in the <hi>third</hi> Joint, and does not doe it out of <hi>Relation</hi> to, or contexture with, the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Prophecies, and so can be no example whereon to infer the like is to be done in the Visions of the <hi>Opened book</hi> farther than there is the same necessity of it. For the said <hi>three</hi> Visions were received at such <hi>divers</hi> times, and in such <hi>divers</hi> manners (and the first is but an Interpretation of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s dream) that they have no more relation to each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than the Prophecies of other Prophets on the
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:48067:163"/>
same subjects have to <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Visions. <hi rend="sup">b</hi> But as to the conceived <hi>Ioints</hi> in the <hi>Opened book,</hi> which are imagined to answer to those Instanced in <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, the first is a <hi>mere Imagination.</hi> For the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring the <hi>inward</hi> Court, and not measuring the <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> Court (from which the distinction of <hi>Symme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral</hi> and <hi>Asymmetral</hi> Ages is taken) do <hi>synchronize,</hi> as is shewed in <hi>Remarks</hi> on the <hi>Revelation,</hi> chap. 11. <hi rend="sup">c</hi> The second <hi>Ioint</hi> I agree to be so, <hi>viz.</hi> as it is a Transition from the <hi>Antichristian</hi> Reign to the <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lennial</hi> State; but then say, that the Vials do not <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin</hi> but <hi>end</hi> in that <hi>Ioint.</hi> Which does therefore the better agree with the Instance in <hi>Daniel,</hi> viz. of the <hi>Partial</hi> Vision ending in the <hi>third</hi> Joint. <hi rend="sup">d</hi> Yet is there no need of such partial Visions beginning or ending in such a <hi>Ioint.</hi> For the <hi>three</hi> admonishing <hi>Angels,</hi> Rev. 14. is a like Vision which does neither. <hi rend="sup">e</hi> The great pains taken to prove that the Vials do not begin with the Trumpets might have been spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. For that without scruple will be agreed. But no use can be made of it for the purpose designed, <hi>viz.</hi> That they must then begin at the end of the Trumpets (which is the next Joint) For the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets belonging to the <hi>sealed,</hi> and the Vials to the <hi>opened</hi> Book, and they being distinct Series of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies, which have no contexture or Relation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them (as is aforesaid of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Visions) though they synchronize, the <hi>Vials</hi> in the <hi>one</hi> are not to be guided by any <hi>Ioints</hi> in the <hi>other</hi> Series for their beginning or ending. <hi rend="sup">f</hi> Nor as I have shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is their beginning or ending in such a <hi>Ioint</hi> need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, though I have agreed they end in such a <hi>Ioint.</hi>

                     <hi>Ans.</hi> It would amaze any man of an ingenuous Spirit to observe how strangely the <hi>Remarker</hi> in the very entrance shuffles and flunders to evade the force of the plain and orderly Reasoning of the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positor,</hi> which in brief is this. In the Book of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> it is to be noted, that after the <hi>two first</hi> Visions which <hi>synchronize,</hi> and contain the Representation of the four Monarchies (the conterminations of which Monarchies, that is, the Times wherein the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ends, and the subsequent begins, are as so many <hi>eminent Ioints</hi> in the two Visions) there is a Vision that begins short of the time of the two former, and is added for a more full Representation of some things to fall out in some of the Monarchies of the former. And that it also commences with the <hi>first</hi> of the three <hi>eminent Ioints</hi> of the former. It is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted also in the <hi>two first</hi> Visions of the <hi>Opened book</hi> in the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> that begin from the same <hi>Epocha,</hi> and end in the same times, and have two <hi>eminent Ioints,</hi> as <hi>Daniel</hi>'s had three, <hi>viz.</hi> The first the Contermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the <hi>Antemedial</hi> Synchronals with the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial,</hi> which is the same with the Contermination of the <hi>sixth Seal</hi> with the <hi>seventh Seal</hi> or <hi>first Trumpet.</hi> The other the Contermination of the <hi>Medial</hi> Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chronals with the <hi>Post-medial,</hi> which is the same with the Contermination of the <hi>sixth Trumpet</hi> with the <hi>seventh,</hi> the Time of the <hi>Risen Witnesses</hi> and <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial fall</hi> of the <hi>City.</hi> It is noted, I say, that after these two <hi>synchronizing</hi> Visions, there is a Vision of the <hi>Vials</hi> that comes short of the <hi>Epocha</hi> of the <hi>two former</hi> Visions, as that other does in <hi>Daniel.</hi> And therefore the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> being such an Imitation of <hi>Daniel</hi> as it is, and they such a <hi>mutual Key</hi> to one another, it is reasonable to conclude, That this <hi>third</hi>
                     <pb n="300" facs="tcp:48067:164"/>
Vision in the <hi>Opened book,</hi> whose <hi>Epocha</hi> falls short of the two former; that its <hi>Epocha,</hi> I say, must be placed in one of the <hi>two</hi> eminent <hi>Ioints</hi> of the two foregoing Visions, and so, as it may serve the like end as that <hi>third</hi> Vision in <hi>Daniel</hi> does, <hi>viz.</hi> more fully to represent the matters belonging to some space of time in the foregoing Visions. The Remarker himself is agreed that it is not to be placed in the <hi>first Ioint.</hi> Wherefore its natural place is at the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Joint after the <hi>Risen Witnesses</hi> and <hi>partial</hi> fall of <hi>Babylon.</hi> For upon this it is presently said, The <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Wo</hi> is past, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>second Wo-Trumpet,</hi> or <hi>sixth Trumpet.</hi> This is the first Argument of the Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitor, the following arguments are to be considered afterwards. Now what says the Remarker to this?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="sup">a</hi> If a succeeding Vision, says he, Prophesie but of the three first of these Monarchies, it must of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity end in the third Joint, and does not doe it out of any relation to, or contexture with, the precedent Prophecies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But I answer, that the succeeding Vision does not Prophesie of the three first of these Monarchies, but of the second and third, and for that very purpose begins at the first Joint, <hi>viz.</hi> with the <hi>Persian</hi> Monarchy: Nor does end at the <hi>third Ioint,</hi> but with the affairs of <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> they respecting the <hi>Church</hi> of the <hi>Iews,</hi> for whose cause this succeeding Vision is subjoined; but the line of this part, <hi>viz.</hi> of the third Kingdom continued near an hundred years longer, though I will not gainsay but in some considerable sense the times of <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi> may be said to be in the close of the third Kingdom. But it was the beginning at the <hi>first Ioint</hi> for the <hi>passing</hi> to the <hi>second,</hi> and to the
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:48067:164"/>
third Kingdom, which was the design. So that we see that this succeeding Vision is in mere subservien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to the fuller illustrating some affairs touching the Church that were to be in the Times of the <hi>third Monarchy,</hi> and therefore has relation to the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Visions as a <hi>supplement</hi> to some parts thereof, and thence is a fit example whereon to infer the like was to be done in the Visions of the <hi>Opened book.</hi> And that which he farther adds of these three Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons being received at such <hi>divers</hi> times, and in such <hi>divers</hi> manners, one being but an Interpretation of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s dream, how weak and impertinent is this? as if that Wisedom which inspired <hi>Daniel,</hi> could not so attemperate his Visions that they might be thus subservient one to another. And besides, they are <hi>actually placed</hi> thus in <hi>Daniel</hi>'s book of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies as the other three <hi>are</hi> in the <hi>Apocalypse.</hi> So altogether nothing is it, that the Remarker has hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto alledged.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="sup">b</hi> But now, secondly, as to what he says of the <hi>first Ioint</hi> in the two first Visions in the <hi>Opened book,</hi> that it is a mere Imagination the <hi>Inward</hi> and the <hi>Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> Court <hi>synchronizing,</hi> I have so fully confuted that fond conceit of his in my <hi>Answer</hi> to his <hi>Remarks</hi> on that place, that I need onely here remind him of it. Nothing can be more rude and absurd than that.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="sup">c</hi> Thirdly, As for the <hi>second Ioint,</hi> it is most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly an Authentick Joint, whether the Remarker will agree to it or no, and plainly demonstrated by Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> in his Synchronisms, and solidly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the <hi>Expositor,</hi> nor to be denied by any one in his Wits, it being the <hi>Contermination</hi> of the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial</hi> Synchronals with the <hi>Post-Medial,</hi> and of the
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:48067:165"/>
                     <hi>sixth Trumpet</hi> with the <hi>seventh</hi>; But where the <hi>Vials</hi> are o be placed is the thing in dispute, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the beginning of the <hi>Millennium</hi> properly so called.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="sup">d</hi> Fourthly, His arguing that there is no need that a <hi>partial</hi> Vision should commence with some <hi>emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Ioint</hi> of the more <hi>general</hi> Vision preceding, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the <hi>three</hi> admonishing <hi>Angels</hi> is <hi>a like</hi> Vision, and does not, is very infirm: Forasmuch as that of the <hi>three</hi> admonishing <hi>Angels</hi> is <hi>no partial</hi> Vision in such a sense as the third Vision in <hi>Daniel</hi> is, and the Vision of the <hi>Vials,</hi> but merely <hi>part</hi> of a Vision, <hi>viz.</hi> of the second Vision of the <hi>Opened book.</hi> And the <hi>first</hi> Angel belongs to the <hi>Medial</hi> Times, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond to the Enterance of the <hi>Post-Medial</hi> Times, the <hi>joyfull Annunciation</hi> of the fall of <hi>Babylon</hi> respecting the <hi>fall of the City</hi> at the time of the <hi>Rising of the Witnesses,</hi> which was just at the close of the <hi>sixth Trumpet,</hi> as I noted before. So that all that follows (<hi>chap.</hi> 14.) from <hi>vers.</hi> 8. to the end of the Chapter, respects things or events <hi>after</hi> the <hi>Rising of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="sup">e</hi> Fifthly, The Expositor's pains in proving that the Vials do not commence with the Trumpets, is not mis-spent, because some learned men have been inclined to that opinion, and there are some shews and plausibilities for it. And sixthly, the pains ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to remove the Vials from the beginning of the Trumpets is not to place them at the <hi>end</hi> of the <hi>Trumpets,</hi> (For the end of the Trumpets is no <hi>Ioint</hi> at all, the seventh Trumpet reaching to the end of the World) but it is to place them in the <hi>second Ioint</hi> of the two foregoing Visions, <hi>viz.</hi> at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of the <hi>Medial</hi> and <hi>Post-Medial</hi> Synchro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:48067:165"/>
which is the same with the contermination of the <hi>sixth</hi> and <hi>seventh Trumpet.</hi> At the close of the former of which the <hi>Witnesses rise,</hi> and the City of <hi>Babylon</hi> falls in <hi>part.</hi> So that if they be placed at the <hi>second Ioint</hi> of the two first Visions of the <hi>Open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed book,</hi> it is all one as the placing them in the <hi>second Ioint</hi> of the Vision of the <hi>Sealed book.</hi> And besides, to say, The <hi>Trumpets</hi> belonging to the <hi>Sealed book,</hi> and the <hi>Vials</hi> belonging to the <hi>Opened book,</hi> and they being <hi>distinct Prophecies,</hi> have no relation one to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, is a wonderfull groundless Assertion, and point blank against the express Indication of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Prophecy in the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> who referreth the <hi>Rising of the Witnesses</hi> and the <hi>partial fall</hi> of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> to the <hi>exitus</hi> of the <hi>second Wo-trumpet</hi> or <hi>sixth Trumpet:</hi> And yet the Rising of the Witnesses is <hi>part</hi> of a Vision of the <hi>Opened book</hi>; And what corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondency things have prophesied of in the <hi>Sealed book,</hi> to those prophesied of in the <hi>Opened book,</hi> it were easie to shew, but it would take up too much time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="sup">f</hi> And seventhly and lastly, what the Remarker will call <hi>needfull,</hi> I know not, but that the placing of a <hi>partial</hi> Vision should be at some <hi>eminent knot</hi> of the more <hi>general</hi> Vision preceding, is wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully natural and congruous, which is the <hi>first argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of the Expositor for placing the Vials at the <hi>second Ioint</hi> of the preceding Visions, when the <hi>first</hi> would not do. But besides this, there are <hi>four</hi> arguments more added, which we will now see how well the Remarker can evade, in his next Remark, which is as follows.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="304" facs="tcp:48067:166"/>
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 280, 281. The imagined <hi>slight intimations,</hi> saith he, of the seven Vials, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11, 18, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is a very <hi>slight fancy.</hi> 
                     <hi rend="sup">a</hi> The <hi>Nations anger</hi> is that for which the <hi>wrath of God</hi> is there said to come upon them (and not <hi>their anger</hi> or exulcerate Rage <hi>at the Reformation,</hi> which Anger is made to be the first Vial, but cannot be so, as is shewed in Remarks) <hi>viz.</hi> whereas the Devil having great wrath on his being cast down from Heaven, went thereon to make war with the Saints, the <hi>Beasts warring against them,</hi> by his instigation (persecuting not onely with death, but with all other subtile and mischievous Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Practices) is <hi>that Anger of the Nations</hi>; for which it is said, <hi>Thy wrath is come,</hi> viz. to reward them as they had rewarded the Saints, <hi>chap.</hi> 18.6. and to destroy them that destroy'd the Earth. So that this wrath cannot be applied to the <hi>third</hi> or any other <hi>Vial,</hi> but to the whole judgment of God, which ruined the Antichristian party, and inflicted due punishment on them. <hi rend="sup">b</hi> The <hi>Temple of God</hi> does signifie (as is shewed in <hi>Remarks</hi>) the Emperours embracing the Christian profession, so far is it from being applicable to any of the <hi>Vials</hi>; Nor does ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear any reason why it should be applied to the <hi>sixth Vial,</hi> unless because it is supposed the <hi>Iews</hi> will then be converted. Which if they be, they will be then no more concerned in the Temple of God and Ark of the Covenant than the Christians. The <hi>Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake and great Hail</hi> supposed to belong to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Vial, signifies (as is shew'd in <hi>Remarks</hi>) the great Revolutions in the World, by shaking the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers thereof, which would be caused by Christianity being autorized by the Emperours for the Religion
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:48067:166"/>
of the Empire. <hi rend="sup">c</hi> The <hi>Acclamations in Heaven</hi> at the seventh Trumpet are no ways applicable to the <hi>Rising of the Witnesses,</hi> and nor they nor the <hi>Doxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy</hi> of the <hi>Elders</hi> do answer to the <hi>Triumphal Song, chap.</hi> 15. which indeed is no such Song, as is shewed in <hi>Remarks.</hi> And lastly, all those Thanksgivings sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie a much more flourishing state of Christ's King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom by the absolute vanquishing of his enemies, and subduing them than can be at the <hi>Rising of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi rend="sup">d</hi> The fansied <hi>glances,</hi> chap. 14. at the things of the fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh <hi>Vials</hi> are as <hi>slight conceits</hi> as the said <hi>slight Intimations.</hi> But it was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visedly done to omit instancing in the <hi>words</hi> that do so <hi>glance,</hi> because it is so hard to doe it. <hi rend="sup">e</hi> Nor does it appear of what use the so <hi>glancing</hi> at the affairs of the <hi>Vials</hi> here, and the <hi>slight intimations</hi> of them aforesaid at the seventh Trumpet can be, save onely what they are invented for, <hi>viz.</hi> to give colour to that <hi>crazy conceit</hi> of placing the <hi>Vials</hi> within the <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Trumpet.</hi> But there is so little or nothing said for them, that they are not worth saying so much against them; especially I having given such account of the same Scriptures in my <hi>Remarks</hi> as will suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently shew the vanity of those conceits, if it be not apparent enough already. <hi rend="sup">f</hi> Which account does make the 8<hi>th</hi> verse (which is supposed to glance at the <hi>second Ioint</hi> of the Prophecy,) to respect a much higher time, <hi>viz.</hi> the revolting of the <hi>Waldenses.</hi> And the following to the 13<hi>th</hi> (which is supposed to <hi>glance</hi> at the <hi>fourth Vial</hi>) to respect <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Vials</hi> as a <hi>Monition.</hi> To which also belongs the next verse, <hi>viz.</hi> v. 13. which is supposed (though no appearance why) to glance at the <hi>fifth Vial.</hi> And the said Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count

And from <hi>v.</hi> 17. to the end of the Chapter, (which is supposed to <hi>glance</hi> at the <hi>seventh Vial</hi>) to respect the <hi>preparation</hi> of the Antichristian party to the great battel at the <hi>seventh Vial,</hi> and the seventh Trumpet and the issue thereof. <hi rend="sup">g</hi> And as to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Visions of the <hi>Vials</hi> in <hi>chap.</hi> 15. and 16. as a <hi>supplement</hi> to <hi>chap.</hi> 11. though it be said here there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, <hi>We may be sure it is sound and right</hi>; yet it is as groundless as any thing I have spoken to, as appears by my <hi>Remarks</hi>; and what I have said, or shall say, against the placing the Vials within the seventh Trumpet.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> The next argument of the <hi>Expositor</hi> for the placing the <hi>Vials</hi> within the <hi>seventh Trumpet,</hi> is, that placing them at the <hi>second Ioint,</hi> their Position will be such, that they will <hi>more fully illustrate</hi> those times of the foregoing Visions, in which things are more scantly and obscurely represented, namely the times <hi>after</hi> the <hi>Rising of the Witnesses,</hi> chap. 11.18. but are such as relate to some of the <hi>Vials.</hi> As the <hi>wrath of the Nations</hi> to the <hi>first,</hi> The <hi>wrath of God</hi> to the <hi>third,</hi> The <hi>Ark of the Covenant</hi> to the <hi>sixth,</hi> And the <hi>Earthquake and great Hail</hi> to the <hi>seventh.</hi> And there is no question but the plagues of the <hi>Vials</hi> are <hi>Vials</hi> of <hi>Wo</hi> to the Beast, and any one unpreju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced will say that they are the <hi>plagues</hi> the <hi>third Wo-Trumpet</hi> or the <hi>seventh Trumpet</hi> is charged with. For presently after the <hi>Rising of the Witnesses</hi> and <hi>fall</hi> of the <hi>City</hi> it is said, the <hi>second Wo is past,</hi> and behold the <hi>third Wo</hi> cometh <hi>quickly,</hi> and there is nothing
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:48067:167"/>
but the <hi>Acclamations</hi> in <hi>Heaven</hi> and the <hi>Doxology</hi> of the <hi>Elders</hi> interposed, as an <hi>Interlude,</hi> and the Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on goes on. What then can it go on to, but to some manner of description of the <hi>third Wo,</hi> which was to come <hi>quickly,</hi> which are the plagues contained in the <hi>third Wo-Trumpet?</hi> For upon the saying the <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Wo is past,</hi> and the <hi>third Wo</hi> cometh <hi>quickly,</hi> it is likewise said <hi>immediately,</hi> And the <hi>seventh Angel</hi> sounded, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Wherefore what can be expected af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that short <hi>Interlude,</hi> but some kind of description of the plagues of the <hi>third Wo-Trumpet,</hi> which is the <hi>seventh Trumpet,</hi> which I say are the <hi>Vials,</hi> which are more <hi>obscurely</hi> and <hi>defectuously</hi> here intimated. The first the <hi>intoxicating Cup of wrath,</hi> which <hi>demen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates</hi> men, and <hi>infatuates</hi> their counsels. This is hinted at by that short passage, <hi>And the Nations were angry.</hi> Which anger, according to the sense of <hi>all</hi> Expositors, is their <hi>Anger</hi> and <hi>Envy</hi> conceived at the <hi>Rising</hi> of the <hi>Witnesses</hi> and <hi>fall</hi> of the <hi>City,</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitely <hi>Antithetal</hi> to the <hi>Acclamations</hi> in Heaven, and <hi>Doxology</hi> of the <hi>Elders.</hi> These things strike so <hi>powerfully</hi> and <hi>strongly</hi> to raise this sense, that a man must be very <hi>dull</hi> and <hi>stupid,</hi> or <hi>wilfully blind,</hi> that does not perceive it, and readily agree to it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="sup">a</hi> And yet the Remarker does not stick to say, That the <hi>Nations Anger</hi> is that for which the <hi>wrath of God</hi> is there said to come upon them, and not their Anger or exulcerate Rage at the Reformation, which anger is made to be the first Vial, but cannot be so, as is shew'd in <hi>Remarks,</hi> &amp;c. But, I say, this <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Envy</hi> and immoderate <hi>Rage,</hi> they being given up to evil spirits to actuate them, that this is the very <hi>first Vial</hi> poured upon them, I have sufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved against his <hi>Remarks</hi> in its proper place, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:48067:168"/>
need not here repeat it. And [Thy wrath is come] refers to the revenge on these Bloud-suckers, who by this <hi>intoxication</hi> will make themselves ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious thereto. Which therefore is rightly referred to the <hi>third Vial.</hi> But for one to bring in by head and shoulders here the <hi>wrath of the Dragon</hi> in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Vision, and in that part thereof which respects things a-many hundred years before, yea above a thousand, when there is so plainly before his face a <hi>fresh</hi> and <hi>notorious</hi> occasion of <hi>new</hi> conceived <hi>wrath,</hi> is to resolve to say any thing rather than profess him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to have nothing to say.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="sup">b</hi> Secondly, As to what relates to the <hi>sixth Vial</hi>; Here he runs into the like extravagance, interpreting the <hi>Temple of God in Heaven</hi> of the Emperours em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing the Christian profession, applying to this part of the Vision, which respects things after the <hi>Rising of the Witnesses,</hi> (as is manifestly proved against his <hi>Remarks</hi>) that which happened above a thousand years before their Rising. And for that <hi>significant Symbol</hi> of the <hi>Conversion</hi> of the <hi>Iews,</hi> which Judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Interpreters of the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> conceive will be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the <hi>sixth Vial</hi>; What a puerile peice of Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry is that to put it off by saying, They will then be no more concerned in the Ark of the Covenant, than the Christians; as if it could not belong to them then, because they would be Christians? But it may signifie notwithstanding that God will <hi>then within</hi> the <hi>compass</hi> of the <hi>sixth Vial</hi> have an <hi>eye</hi> to his ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting <hi>Covenant</hi> he made with the <hi>Iews,</hi> and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert them to Christianity. And it will be always true, that this was a prophetick Type and prefigura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof, even when they are turned Christians. And lastly, as to the <hi>Earthquake</hi> and <hi>Hail</hi> that does
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:48067:168"/>
so palpably answer to the <hi>seventh Vial</hi>; That it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally does so, and does not respect any Revolutions upon the Pagan Emperours turning Christians, I have in my Answer to his <hi>Remarks</hi> upon <hi>chap.</hi> 11. <hi>vers.</hi> 19. abundantly demonstrated. And therefore it must necessarily <hi>glance</hi> at the <hi>seventh Vial.</hi> So that it being so plain, that the Residue of this Vision is a more imperfect signification of the things that the Vision of the <hi>Vials</hi> does more fully signifie, the argument holds good that the <hi>Vials</hi> must be placed at the beginning of the <hi>seventh Trumpet</hi> or <hi>second Ioint</hi> of the <hi>two first</hi> Visions of the <hi>Opened book,</hi> that they may do the same service to those <hi>two</hi> Visions that the <hi>third</hi> Vision in <hi>Daniel</hi> does to the <hi>two</hi> prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Visions there.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="sup">c</hi> And it is worth the observing, That as the <hi>Vision</hi> of the pouring forth the <hi>Vials</hi> themselves, is much <hi>more full</hi> than the <hi>slighter</hi> account of those affairs in this present Vision, <hi>chap.</hi> 11. So the <hi>Preamble</hi> to the <hi>Vision</hi> of the pouring out of the <hi>Vials</hi> is much more large than the <hi>Preamble</hi> to their more obscure <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendium</hi> here. And farthermore, That as those <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations</hi> in Heaven, and <hi>Doxology</hi> of the <hi>Elders</hi> is upon some real overthrow of the <hi>Babylonish</hi> party, and victory of the Apostolick party, which are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Witnesses</hi>; So the <hi>Triumphal</hi> Song of <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Lamb</hi> must be upon the like victory, and I doubt not but the very same. The <hi>Doxology</hi> of the <hi>Elders</hi> is a Song of <hi>Thanksgiving</hi> plainly: <hi>We give thee thanks, O Lord God Almighty, because thou hast taken to thee thy great power, and hast reigned.</hi> To which answers the Annunciation of the second An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, <hi>chap.</hi> 14. <hi>Babylon is fallen, is fallen</hi> (not <hi>will</hi> fall) the great City; of which a tenth part fell at the <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:48067:169"/>
of the Witnesses.</hi> And in the Song of <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Lamb</hi> it is said; All Nations shall come and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship before thee for thy Judgments <hi>are made manifest,</hi> and this before the pouring out of the Vials, <hi>viz.</hi> in that <hi>partial</hi> fall of <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>Rising of the Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</hi> Thus strongly do these three bind one with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and one would think invincibly. But what says the Remarker to this? The <hi>Acclamations</hi> in Heaven at the <hi>seventh Trumpet,</hi> are in no-wise ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable to the <hi>Rising of the Witnesses,</hi> and nor <hi>they</hi> nor the <hi>Doxology</hi> of the <hi>Elders</hi> do answer to the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphal Song,</hi> chap. 15. which indeed is <hi>no such Song</hi> as is shew'd in <hi>Remarks,</hi> &amp;c. This is a mere sullen denying of a thing without giving any reason for it. That there should be <hi>Acclamations</hi> in Heaven <hi>upon</hi> the fall of <hi>Babylon</hi> and Rising of the Witnesses, and <hi>ushered in</hi> with the <hi>sound of a Trumpet,</hi> and yet should not be applicable thereto, is very humourously and shamelesly spoken. And I have produced reasons to prove that the <hi>Doxology</hi> of the <hi>Elders</hi> does answer to the <hi>Song</hi> of <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Lamb</hi> already, and the Remarker none in his Remarks, that this Song of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> and the <hi>Lamb</hi> is not a <hi>Triumphal</hi> Song. So that things are hitherto firm in themselves, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marker onely obstinate.</p>
                  <p>But he comes in at last with this pretence, That the <hi>Acclamations</hi> and <hi>Doxology</hi> at the <hi>seventh Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet</hi> are too great to be applied to the <hi>Rising of the Witnesses.</hi> To which may be added, that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>after</hi> the sounding of the <hi>seventh Trumpet,</hi> are rather for the effects of it, than for the fruits of the close of the <hi>sixth,</hi> which is the <hi>Rising of the Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</hi> But as to the first; He must be of a very nig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardly gratitude that can think that either those Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:48067:169"/>
in Heaven or Doxology of the Elders ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed so illustrious a Providence as the Rising of the Witnesses, wherein so many Kingdoms, Principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Provinces became the Kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ; nor is it said that <hi>all</hi> Kingdoms then became his. So that the form of speech is strictly within compass: And yet these may be lookt upon but as the <hi>Primitiae</hi> of what was after to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crew thereto, and so that <hi>indefinite</hi> Assertion may be enlarged to what is comprized in future hope and expectation. And in answer to the second I say, The Acclamations and Doxology are not after the sounding of the seventh Trumpet, but commence with it; But the sounding is mentioned first for the better embellishing the <hi>Cortex,</hi> it ushering in, as it were, those Heavenly Acclamations and Doxology of the Elders. And though they may glance at more <hi>enlarged</hi> hopes of <hi>future</hi> Accessions, yet the <hi>princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal</hi> Object and Occasion of this <hi>Thanksgiving</hi> is the <hi>actual</hi> Rising of the Witnesses: And were it not so, this <hi>signal</hi> Providence and <hi>illustrious</hi> Victory would be without any <hi>Doxology</hi> or <hi>Thanksgiving,</hi> which is grosly absurd; that there should be no shout nor sign of joy at such a surprizing Providence as this, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, at the <hi>Reviving</hi> of the <hi>two Witnesses</hi> when they had <hi>lain slain three days and an half</hi> in the streets of the City, nor at their <hi>ascending in a cloud into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> in the <hi>view of all the people,</hi> the <hi>tenth part</hi> of their <hi>City,</hi> that slew them, falling in the mean time by an Earthquake, and many thousands of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies buried in the ruins. How incredible, how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decorous is it that so happy a <hi>Catastrophe</hi> of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses sufferings as this, should pass without a <hi>Plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite?</hi> Therefore it is a sensless thing not to make
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:48067:170"/>
the <hi>Rising of the Witnesses</hi> and the <hi>fall of the City</hi> the Object of those <hi>Acclamations,</hi> and of the <hi>Doxology</hi> of the <hi>Elders,</hi> and contrary to the usual mode of the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> that ever closeth the good success of the Church with some Indications of Joy and Thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, as <hi>chap.</hi> 12. <hi>vers.</hi> 10, 12. <hi>chap.</hi> 19. <hi>vers.</hi> 1. and again <hi>vers.</hi> 21. which concludes with a feast of Joy and Thanksgiving for the victory of the Rider of the white Horse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="sup">d</hi> And now to go on, mindless, in what follows, of the Remarker's <hi>haughty</hi> verbosity the fruits of an <hi>heated Melancholy</hi> and a <hi>crazied fancy,</hi> which makes him reproach the most sound and usefull Truths. I will onely take notice of what is most material he says on this present argument. He says it was advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly done of the Expositor to omit instancing in the words that do so <hi>glance</hi> at the fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh <hi>Vials,</hi> because it is <hi>so hard</hi> to doe it. But I answer, The Expositor omitted it, because it is so easie for any one to doe, that reades his Expositions of this part of this Vision, <hi>chap.</hi> 14. and that of the Vials, <hi>chap.</hi> 16. How these comport one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is manifest. For the <hi>Mystical</hi> Interpretation of the <hi>fourth Vial</hi> shews in what a wretched and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable condition they are in, that adhere to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, their sad case being so manifest out of the word of God, which is the <hi>Sun,</hi> a <hi>Lamp</hi> unto our <hi>feet,</hi> and a <hi>light</hi> unto our <hi>paths.</hi> And this answers to <hi>vers.</hi> 9, 10, 11. of <hi>chap.</hi> 14. where <hi>eternal Torment</hi> and <hi>dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> is denounced to them that <hi>worship the Beast</hi> and his Image, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And it is told in what unquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of conscience they are in, that in the light of those times adventure to doe so. And for <hi>vers.</hi> 12. [Here is the patience of the Saints] (that will not
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:48067:170"/>
go against their consciences, but rather suffer;) that answers to that part of the <hi>fourth Vial</hi> [And men were scorched with great heat, and blasphemed the Name of God] which <hi>Rage</hi> the Mother of <hi>Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> does hugely well comport with the affliction of the Saints, and the patience they are put to for that time. But under the <hi>fifth Vial</hi> there is better news, especially from the <hi>Political</hi> sense thereof, as if there would be some such change of affairs in the behalf of the <hi>Evangelici,</hi> that the seat of the Beast would grow unfrequented, and his Kingdom considerably clouded and darkened, upon which sense therefore of the <hi>fifth Vial</hi> the 13 verse of <hi>chap.</hi> 14. may very well be thought to glance, [Blessed are the dead that dye in the Lord, for their works do follow them] <hi>i. e.</hi> the effect or success of their works and labours for the advancement of the Kingdom of Christ and the fall of Antichrist. [From henceforth] from such a time of the <hi>Sardian</hi> Interval, <hi>viz.</hi> under the <hi>fifth Vial</hi> will the scales turn, and the <hi>Evangelical</hi> power begin to be preponderant to the <hi>Antichristian.</hi> Now the <hi>sixth Vial</hi> concerns the <hi>Conversion of the Iews</hi> haply with some other Eastern people. How fitly therefore and plainly does the <hi>Harvest,</hi> mentioned <hi>chap.</hi> 14.15. glance at the <hi>sixth Vial?</hi> For <hi>conversion</hi> to the <hi>Gospel</hi> is <hi>reaping</hi> the <hi>Harvest,</hi> as our Saviour himself has used the similitude, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.35. And lastly, what an assured Complication of time and affairs there is betwixt the <hi>Vision</hi> of the <hi>Wine-press,</hi> the <hi>seventh Vial</hi> and the <hi>battel of the Rider on the white Horse,</hi> is so fully made out by the Expositor, that no man that has read what he has writ, can doubt of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="sup">e</hi> Farthermore, Whereas the Remarker says it does not appear, of what use the so <hi>glancing</hi> at the affairs
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:48067:171"/>
of the <hi>Vials</hi> here, and the <hi>slight Intimations</hi> of them aforesaid at the <hi>seventh Trumpet</hi> can be, save onely to give colour to the <hi>placing</hi> of the <hi>Vials</hi> in the <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Trumpet</hi>; I say that that use <hi>alone</hi> were abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly sufficient for the Spirit of Prophecy to frame these two first Visions of the <hi>Opened book</hi> so, as that by those <hi>Intimations</hi> and <hi>Glances</hi> not onely <hi>colour,</hi> but <hi>sound evidence</hi> may be given that all the <hi>Vials</hi> are placed within the <hi>seventh Trumpet.</hi> For from hence it will infallibly follow, that they are to be placed <hi>after</hi> the <hi>Rising of the Witnesses,</hi> and that the Rising of the Witnesses was the <hi>late Reformation</hi> begun by <hi>Luther,</hi> &amp;c. which is of <hi>vast</hi> consequence to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood and acknowledged, That God may have condign praise and thanks for so great a mercy to his Church; That broils and stirs of <hi>Phantastical</hi> and <hi>Fanatical</hi> people may be prevented, who are apt to be encouraged to attempt Innovations upon that false conceit that the <hi>Rising of the Witnesses</hi> is near, and that then forsooth, that <hi>very Reformation</hi> will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that is the <hi>true Rising of the Witnesses.</hi> When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as most certainly the Vision is accomplished already. It will also beget a <hi>just esteem</hi> of the <hi>present Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and make men with quiet of conscience and chearfulness of mind hold communion with the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished National Churches, which is good for <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Reformed</hi> Nations and Kingdoms. And lastly, it will, whenas things shall appear so <hi>well</hi> constituted <hi>without,</hi> make men that have any <hi>sense</hi> of, or <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pension</hi> to <hi>Religion,</hi> and a desire to excell therein, to look <hi>within</hi> themselves, and to use all their zeal and heat against those <hi>faults</hi> that are to be reformed <hi>within</hi>; as Pride, Self-conceitedness, Envy, Wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, Implacableness, Censoriousness, Covetousness,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:48067:171"/>
Persidiousness, Contemptuousness, Malepertness a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their Betters, Indulging the use of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Unconversableness, Cavils against publick ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration of affairs, and despising and speaking ill of them that be in Autority, with whatever other vices they discover in themselves; I say, they having no proper Object <hi>without</hi> to exercise their zeal on, in reference to matters of Religion, it will be more <hi>hopefull</hi> they will turn it <hi>inward</hi> against their own corruptions; but now falsly fansying so much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect or corruption in the established Religion and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastick Constitutions, they are prone <hi>foolishly</hi> to imagine themselves <hi>Saints,</hi> for their bitter inveying against the publickly constituted Religion, and the administration of things there; when as they <hi>lye cold enough</hi> to that necessary <hi>inward</hi> Reformation, and are <hi>little sensible</hi> of it. Wherefore, as I said, this use <hi>alone</hi> of the <hi>Intimations</hi> and <hi>Glances</hi> of the <hi>two first Visions,</hi> on the <hi>Vials,</hi> namely that we may thereby be assured that the Vials are all to be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced within the seventh Trumpet, is sufficient that the frame of those two Visions should be so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived.</p>
                  <p>But questionless there are other Uses also, which would be too long to note. These <hi>Intimations</hi> and <hi>Glances</hi> give the better assurance of the sense of the <hi>Vials.</hi> As in the <hi>sixth Vial</hi> for example, which In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters expound of the <hi>Conversion of the Iews,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding <hi>them</hi> by the <hi>Kings of the East.</hi> But there is nothing to signifie <hi>conversion</hi> there. But in this <hi>glance</hi> here, by the mentioning of <hi>Harvest, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version</hi> is implied. And if any one will say, There's <hi>nothing</hi> signifying the <hi>Iews</hi> yet, I say the <hi>Intimation</hi> in the <hi>first Vision</hi> respecting the <hi>sixth Vial,</hi> is the <hi>Ark
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:48067:172"/>
of the Covenant</hi> which must needs point at the <hi>Iews.</hi> But I cannot insist on these things.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="sup">f</hi> Now let us see what account the Remarker gives of those verses of this second Vision, which the Expositor says, do <hi>glance</hi> at the four last Vials. But he begins a verse higher, <hi>viz.</hi> with the 8<hi>th</hi> verse, which, saith he, is supposed to glance at the <hi>second Ioint</hi> of the Prophecy, <hi>viz.</hi> that voice of the Angel, <hi>Babylon is fallen, is fallen,</hi> &amp;c. This, saith he, relates to the Revolt of the <hi>Waldenses,</hi> &amp;c. Which is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to make the Angel pronounce a gross untruth. For <hi>Babylon</hi> was not then fallen, but stood till about four hundred years after they appeared. But in the <hi>first Vision,</hi> at the close of the <hi>sixth Trumpet,</hi> where the Witnesses are said to rise, there the <hi>City</hi> is said to <hi>fall</hi> in <hi>part,</hi> and by the tenour of the second Vision, <hi>Babylon</hi> there can be fallen but in part, the affairs of the last <hi>Vials</hi> being so plainly glanced at after the mention of <hi>Babylon's fall.</hi> So that the fall of that <hi>City</hi> in <hi>part,</hi> chap. 11.13. and the <hi>fall</hi> of <hi>Babylon,</hi> chap. 14.8. do more fully expound one another, the latter plainly declaring <hi>that City</hi> to be <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the former telling us the fall is but <hi>partial:</hi> which the <hi>glances</hi> on the last Vials in the latter Vision do fitly agree with. So that the <hi>fall</hi> of the <hi>City</hi> in the <hi>first</hi> Vision must of necessity be the <hi>fall</hi> of <hi>Babylon</hi> in the <hi>second.</hi> And indeed what can it refer to but that? And who but an exorbitant Humourist, that being mentioned in the first Vision, can imagine any other meant but it in the second? Especially if he consider that these two first Visions of the <hi>Opened book</hi> comprized, the <hi>former</hi> in <hi>chap.</hi> 11. the latter in the 12, 13 and 14 Chapters, begin from the <hi>same Epocha,</hi> and end in the <hi>same time,</hi> concluding with

the <hi>seventh Vial</hi>; and that they have parts all along correspondent one with another, and thereby give to one another mutual light. Wherefore as there is <hi>War,</hi> viz. betwixt the <hi>Beast</hi> and the <hi>Witnesses</hi> in the <hi>first Vision,</hi> so there is betwixt the <hi>Beast</hi> and the <hi>Saints</hi> or <hi>Souldiers of the Lamb</hi> in the <hi>second</hi>; and as there is an <hi>actual</hi> victory of the <hi>Witnesses,</hi> and a <hi>fall</hi> of the <hi>great City</hi> in the <hi>first Vision,</hi> so there must be some thing <hi>actual</hi> in the <hi>second Vision,</hi> that must answer to so notable an Occurrence in the <hi>first.</hi> And what is this but the second Angel's Annunciation of the <hi>fall of Babylon,</hi> which both <hi>answers</hi> to the <hi>fall</hi> of the <hi>great City</hi> in the <hi>first Vision,</hi> and also gives light thereto by plainly shewing it is <hi>Babylon</hi> that is there meant, and that <hi>Babylon</hi>'s fall is but in part? <hi>Babylon, chap.</hi> 14. shews that the <hi>fall</hi> of the <hi>great City,</hi> chap. 11. is the <hi>fall of Babylon,</hi> and the <hi>fall</hi> of the <hi>great City,</hi> chap. 11. being but in <hi>part,</hi> shews that the <hi>fall of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> chap. 14. is <hi>but</hi> in <hi>part</hi> also, <hi>viz.</hi> the tenth part of the City. Thus do these two correspondent pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages of these Visions give mutual light one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And there being nothing in the whole <hi>second Vision</hi> that answers to that notable occurrence in the <hi>first,</hi> but <hi>this; Babylon</hi> in the second Vision and the <hi>fall</hi> thereof must answer to the <hi>fall</hi> of the great <hi>City</hi> in the <hi>first,</hi> and the Rising of the Witnesses; that is to say, The <hi>City</hi> is in <hi>part, actually</hi> fallen in the <hi>first Vision,</hi> therefore (Prophecy being an <hi>anticipatory</hi> History, and these two prophetical Visions corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sponding one with another) it ought to be, and is so in the second. What can be more clear? And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>City fallen</hi> in the <hi>first Vision</hi> being at the <hi>close</hi> of the <hi>sixth Trumpet, Babylon</hi> fallen in the <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Vision,</hi> must be also at the close of the sixth
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:48067:173"/>
Trumpet, and at the Rising of the Witnesses; which was the thing to be demonstrated.</p>
                  <p>Now let us proceed to the Remarker's account of those verses of the second Vision, which the Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor says <hi>glance</hi> at the four last Vials. The 9, 10, 11, and 12<hi>th</hi> verses, which <hi>glance</hi> at the <hi>fourth Vial,</hi> he will have to respect <hi>all</hi> the Vials as a <hi>Monition.</hi> But if merely they did so, being the <hi>effusion</hi> of the <hi>Vials</hi> is for the <hi>confusion</hi> of the <hi>Beast,</hi> and for the <hi>victory</hi> of the <hi>Saints,</hi> it would not then be said, <hi>Here is the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience of the Saints,</hi> &amp;c. but, <hi>Here is their Ioy and Exultation.</hi> So that this is a <hi>confounded</hi> account, and absonous, the Expositor's <hi>distinct,</hi> that makes it respect <hi>chiefly</hi> the <hi>fourth Vial,</hi> not all of them alike, and is agreeable to the nature of the thing. And the same may be said of the 13<hi>th</hi> verse, That the Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitor's account is more <hi>distinct</hi> that makes it relate to the <hi>fifth Vial</hi> for the reason above alledged, that the <hi>Sardian</hi> Church will emerge then out of some more than ordinary affliction which it was under, during the <hi>fourth Vial,</hi> which affliction is predicted or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naced in the Epistle to that Church. But all this is lost in the <hi>confused</hi> account of the Remarker. The 14, 15 and 16<hi>th</hi> verses, which respect the <hi>sixth Vial,</hi> he will have to respect the <hi>Rising of the Witnesses,</hi> which is a thing plainly impossible, it having been demonstrated, and will be still farther, that all the Vials are within the seventh Trumpet after the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the Witnesses; And it was more particularly even now proved, that the <hi>fall</hi> of <hi>Babylon</hi> in this Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion mentioned, synchronizeth with the <hi>fall</hi> of the <hi>City</hi> mentioned in the former Vision, and with the Rising of the Witnesses; and therefore what things
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:48067:173"/>
are prefigured in these 14, 15 and 16 verses, must be after the Rising of the Witnesses. And by the bye I will here note, the <hi>fall</hi> of <hi>Babylon</hi> synchronizing, as hath been proved, with the <hi>fall</hi> of the <hi>great City,</hi> chap. 11. and the Remarker making the third Angel a Premonitor to <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Vials,</hi> it necessarily follows, from what I have proved, and from what he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self <hi>asserts,</hi> that all the Vials follow the <hi>fall</hi> of the <hi>great City</hi> and Rising of the Witnesses. The 17, 18, 19 and last verses, which glance at the seventh Vial, he will have to respect the <hi>preparation</hi> of the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian</hi> Party to the great battel at the seventh Vial, and the issue thereof. And why not, I pray you, the <hi>Battel it self</hi> also? So that here the <hi>Remarker,</hi> (if he would speak out) and the <hi>Expositor</hi> do agree, and he, as well as the Expositor, makes the second Vision end with the seventh Vial, as it is plain the first Vision does, which ends with an Earthquake and great Hail, which in the seventh Vial are said to be Hailstones of a Talent weight, which are great indeed.</p>
                  <p>The first of the four arguments mentioned at the beginning, viz. <hi>That the placing of the Vials at the second Ioint of the two first Visions does illustrate the Remainders of those two Visions, several passages of the said Remainders respecting several of the Vials, and receiving light therefrom, and also giving light thereto,</hi> being thus unexceptionably and irrefutably maintained, we will proceed to the three remaining. The Expositor's <hi>second</hi> Reason for placing the seven last plagues, which are those of the <hi>Vials,</hi> after the <hi>sixth Trumpet,</hi> or in the <hi>second Ioint</hi> of the abovesaid Visions is this. The <hi>six Trumpets</hi> are a <hi>set</hi> or <hi>num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> of plagues, and mentioned before these of the
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:48067:174"/>
Vials, which is another <hi>set</hi> of plagues, which <hi>whole set</hi> are called the <hi>last plagues</hi>; Wherefore this <hi>whole set</hi> must be placed after the other, unless some neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary Reason withstand. The answering this second argument, the Remarker either heedlesly forgets, or discreetly declines, it being undeniable but the <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> Position is that which the Expositor contends for. The Expositor's <hi>third</hi> argument is this, That though in reference to all the <hi>six plagues</hi> of the <hi>Trumpets,</hi> the seven <hi>last</hi> plagues are rightly so called, yet the <hi>two later</hi> of the six Trumpets being called <hi>Wo-Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets,</hi> that is to say, <hi>Plague-Trumpets</hi> in a special man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and that <hi>inflicted</hi> for the <hi>Pagano-christian Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi> in the Empire, of which the <hi>Western</hi> Empire did not repent upon the destruction of the <hi>Eastern</hi> for that wickedness, that the <hi>seven plagues</hi> may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in a more special manner the seven <hi>last</hi> plagues, in reference to the <hi>two preceding Plague-Trumpets,</hi> which immediately follow the fourth Trumpet; and that upon these <hi>two later</hi> Plague-Trumpets being past, the seven <hi>last</hi> plagues or <hi>Vial-plagues</hi> with the <hi>last</hi> Plague-Trumpet should succeed, and be inflicted upon these impenitent Idolaters of the West part of the Empire. And the Text says expresly, <hi>The second Wo is past,</hi> that is, the second <hi>Plague</hi> is, <hi>viz.</hi> the Plague of the <hi>Euphratean</hi> Horse-men, and the <hi>third Wo</hi> or <hi>Plague</hi> cometh quickly, and then the <hi>third</hi> or <hi>last</hi> Plague-Trumpet sounds; and what can it breathe out but the seven <hi>last plagues,</hi> which is the <hi>Title</hi> of the <hi>Vials?</hi> This is the Expositor's <hi>third</hi> argument, and a plain and sound one too, and such as the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marker had the discretion to say nothing to. And lastly, for making the <hi>Vision</hi> of the <hi>Vials</hi> a <hi>supple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> to Chapter the eleventh, it is a sound and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptionable
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:48067:174"/>
conclusion from Premisses the Remarker can never enervate, nor is there any thing in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks which I have not fully answered, nor hath he said any thing, nor will be ever able to say any thing which will disprove the placing of the Vials in the seventh Trumpet, whereby that Vision may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood to be a less fit <hi>Supplement</hi> to the Vision in the eleventh Chapter.</p>

                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 282. <hi rend="sup">a</hi> Whenas it is argued that all the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Vials must be placed within the seventh Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, because they follow a great Victory and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph over the Beast, which must needs be the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the Witnesses, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There is no such Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Triumphal Song precedent to the Vials as is supposed (as is shew'd in Remarks) but onely a Song of admiring and glorifying God for his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to be executed by the Vials, and this sung by the Victors over the Beast during the Antichristian reign, <hi>viz.</hi> by the <hi>Sealed Company</hi> of the <hi>Lamb,</hi> &amp;c. <hi rend="sup">b</hi> And whereas the <hi>fall</hi> of <hi>Babylon, chap.</hi> 14.8. and of the City, <hi>chap.</hi> 11.13. are made to synchronize with the Rising of the Witnesses, and to signifie the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory gained by them, how groundless this conceit is, see Remarks on the said <hi>chap,</hi> 11.13. and <hi>chap.</hi> 14.8. Yet this is <hi>p.</hi> 282. called <hi>invincible evidence</hi>; and it's said there, that <hi>nothing</hi> can be <hi>more demonstrable,</hi> whenas nothing is there demonstrated, but onely, How the <hi>weakness</hi> of <hi>arguments</hi> to place the <hi>Vials</hi> within the <hi>seventh Trumpet,</hi> is supplied with <hi>strength</hi> of <hi>confidence</hi> and <hi>imagination.</hi> 
                     <hi rend="sup">c</hi> But whereas the <hi>Dox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ology,</hi> chap. 11.16, 17. and the joyfull <hi>Annunciation</hi> of <hi>Babylon's fall,</hi> chap. 14.8. and the <hi>Triumphal Song,</hi> chap. 15. are made to fall in together, and signifie
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:48067:175"/>
the <hi>same</hi> Song of Triumph; this is inconsistent with the making the said <hi>chap.</hi> 14.8. to signifie the same with <hi>chap.</hi> 11.13. which precedes the seventh Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, whenas the Doxology follows it. <hi rend="sup">d</hi> And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>Sardis</hi> is said to signifie a <hi>Song of Ioy,</hi> and to fall in with the said three Songs, it signifies also a <hi>Remnant,</hi> to which sense of the word the Epistle seems chiefly to allude. So that the <hi>harmonious Coincidency</hi> that is imagined of all these supposed <hi>Triumphal Songs,</hi> is no better than the <hi>clinking</hi> of the Bells, as one <hi>think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> The second and third argument of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positor; <hi>S. E.</hi> thought fit to take no notice of, as was observed in our Answer to the foregoing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark. <hi rend="sup">a</hi> But here in the beginning of this he vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safes to consider his fourth argument, <hi>viz.</hi> That all the seven Vials must be placed within the seventh Trumpet, because they follow a great Victory and Triumph over the Beast, which must needs be the Rising of the Witnesses, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To which <hi>S. E.</hi> bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly answers; There is no such <hi>Victory</hi> and <hi>Triumphal Song</hi> precedent to the <hi>Vials,</hi> as is supposed (as is shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Remarks) but onely a Song of admiring and glorifying God for his judgments <hi>to be executed,</hi> by the <hi>Vials,</hi> and this sung by the Victors over the Beast, during the Antichristian Reign, <hi>viz.</hi> by the <hi>Sealed company,</hi> with the <hi>Lamb,</hi> &amp;c. This is stout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to deny a thing, but here is no reason produced for the Denial; and what is pretended in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks, I have there shewn the Invalidity thereof. And since, in the maintaining the first of the four ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, <hi>pag.</hi> 309. <hi>l.</hi> 16. I have abundantly proved that as well the <hi>Song</hi> of <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Lamb,</hi> as the <hi>Dox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ology</hi> of the <hi>Elders,</hi> and the <hi>Annunciation</hi> of the <hi>fall
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:48067:175"/>
of Babylon</hi> is upon an <hi>actual</hi> Victory and Judgments of God on the Antichristian party. And again have demonstrated <hi>pag.</hi> 317. That the <hi>fall of Babylon,</hi> chap. 14. and the <hi>fall</hi> of the <hi>tenth part of the City</hi> is the <hi>same,</hi> and consequently that <hi>Babylon</hi>'s fall there is in the close of the sixth Trumpet; And therefore the <hi>Residue</hi> of that Vision glancing at several of the <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als,</hi> as has been proved, it's plain that not onely the <hi>Vials</hi> follow the sixth Trumpet, but that the Song of <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Lamb,</hi> that immediately precedes the <hi>Vials,</hi> is a joyfull acknowledgment of a real victory over the Antichristian party in a <hi>Political</hi> sense, as well as that <hi>Annunciation</hi> of the Angel, That <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon is fallen,</hi> and the <hi>Doxology</hi> of the Elders upon the Rising of the Witnesses. Which <hi>Annunciation</hi> of the <hi>Angel,</hi> and <hi>Doxology</hi> of the <hi>Elders</hi> a more brief and compendious adumbration of the Vials doth follow. And therefore as <hi>these parts</hi> are the <hi>same</hi> with the <hi>Vials,</hi> though in a <hi>contracted</hi> way, so the <hi>Annuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the <hi>Angel</hi> and <hi>Doxology</hi> of the <hi>Elders</hi> are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to be the same with the <hi>Song</hi> of <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Lamb,</hi> though in a more <hi>contracted</hi> way.</p>
                  <p>In brief, The fall of <hi>Babylon,</hi> chap. 14. being in the <hi>close</hi> of the <hi>sixth Trumpet,</hi> as well as the Rising of the Witnesses, <hi>chap.</hi> 11. and a more <hi>compendious</hi> description of the <hi>Vials</hi> immediately following each of them; it is plain that the Song of <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Lamb prefixed</hi> before the <hi>Vials,</hi> has a very fit and fresh Object, the fall of <hi>Babylon</hi> and the <hi>Rising of the Witnesses,</hi> and worth the praising and glorifying God for his Judgments therein; and it is said in the Song, All Nations shall come and worship before thee, <hi>for thy judgments are made manifest.</hi> Again, The fall of <hi>Babylon</hi> and the <hi>Rising</hi> of the <hi>Witnesses,</hi> cannot but
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:48067:176"/>
imply a victory over the <hi>Beast</hi>; and there is in this Song mention of those that had <hi>got the victory over the Beast, and over his Image,</hi> &amp;c. Thirdly, The fall of <hi>Babylon</hi> is really the <hi>fall</hi> of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> the <hi>Pontifician</hi> Power being denoted by both, and therefore the <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing</hi> of the <hi>Witnesses</hi> implies a deliverance from the yoke and bondage of that <hi>Aegyptian Pharaoh,</hi> and his overthrow in the <hi>Red Sea.</hi> And those that sing this Song, are said to stand <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that is on the shoar of that Sea that was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into Glass or Ice, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.8. while the <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> passed over, and to sing the Song of <hi>Moses</hi> the servant of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Fourthly and lastly, the Song is exquisitely framed to signifie a Thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving for a victory and deliverance <hi>actually</hi> obtained; and therefore if we cannot be certain that it is for such an actual deliverance and victory, we can be certain of the sense of nothing. This, I hope, is <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible evidence, nor</hi> can any thing be <hi>more demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strable,</hi> and may deserve better language than what the <hi>rude</hi> Remarker gives, <hi>viz.</hi> That nothing is here demonstrated, but onely, how the <hi>weakness</hi> of <hi>argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> is supplied with <hi>strength</hi> of <hi>confidence</hi> and <hi>ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="sup">b</hi> And now for the fall of <hi>Babylon</hi> synchronizing with the Rising of the Witnesses, there wants no new proof thereof here. What has been said already on this Remark, proves it over and over again. And if any one will consult my Answer on <hi>S. E.</hi> his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks upon <hi>chap.</hi> 11. and <hi>chap.</hi> 14. it will be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent unto him, that what he says there signifies no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the invalidating this present Position. So that it is a groundless boast of <hi>S. E.</hi> to make any such Reference.</p>
                  <p>

                     <hi rend="sup">c</hi> And for the next clause of this Remark, I say, the Expositor does not make <hi>chap.</hi> 14.8. to signifie the same with <hi>chap.</hi> 11.13. For this latter contains onely the <hi>fall</hi> of the great <hi>City,</hi> but the former the bringing the <hi>joyfull News</hi> of the <hi>fall</hi> of the <hi>great City</hi> or of <hi>Babylon,</hi> which joyfull Annunciation sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses what happens <hi>chap.</hi> 11.13. and the <hi>Annuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of it, it self follows in order of time after that Accident, <hi>as well</hi> as the <hi>Acclamations</hi> in Heaven, or <hi>Doxology</hi> of the Elders.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="sup">d</hi> And now lastly, for that <hi>boyish</hi> Clause of <hi>S. E.</hi> so <hi>grave a Divine</hi> as he may seem to be from his <hi>skill</hi> in the <hi>holy tongue,</hi> whereby he is able to note, that <hi>Sar</hi> in <hi>Sardis</hi> may as well signifie a <hi>Remnant</hi> as a <hi>Song</hi>; though it be but a <hi>childish chiming</hi> piece of wit of his thus to allude to that old Proverb, <hi>As the fool thinketh, so the bell clinketh</hi>; yet to give him his due, he shews himself a man of no small judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the manner of his Application, he <hi>omitting</hi> the mention of <hi>Fool,</hi> and so <hi>closely</hi> reserving <hi>that</hi> Title to <hi>himself.</hi> In which that he has done <hi>himself</hi> all imaginable <hi>Right,</hi> I shall prove in that he has so fondly substituted <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which signifies <hi>Reliquiae,</hi> for <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which signifies <hi>Canticum</hi> in the Aetymological account of the word <hi>Sardis.</hi> For his reasoning here is wonderfull <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>sorry.</hi> For First, Though <hi>Sar</hi> in <hi>Sardis</hi> signifies as well a <hi>Remnant</hi> as a <hi>Song,</hi> yet it signifying both, and the latter sense complying so well with the <hi>joyfull Annunciation</hi> of the Angel, with the <hi>Acclamations</hi> in Heaven and <hi>Doxology</hi> of the <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> and with the <hi>Song</hi> of <hi>Moses</hi> the servant of God, and of the Lamb, which all respect the commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Sardian</hi> Church, the Expositor had most solid and unexceptionable reason to make choice of
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:48067:177"/>
that sense of <hi>Sar</hi> in <hi>Sardis</hi> that comported so mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly with the <hi>Song</hi> of <hi>Moses</hi> and those other signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications of <hi>Ioy</hi> upon the <hi>fall</hi> of <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>Rising</hi> of the <hi>Witnesses,</hi> and the commencing of the <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> Interval of the Church the late happy Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, so many strings drawing and tyeing us to that determinate sense rather than any other. Secondly, Suppose <hi>Sar</hi> to signifie <hi>Remnant,</hi> how will he rid himself of the latter part of the word, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Dis,</hi> which signifies <hi>Ioy.</hi> So that this Remnant will be a <hi>Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Ioy</hi> however, or a <hi>joyfull Remnant.</hi> Who therefore cannot but break forth into <hi>Doxologies, Praises</hi> and <hi>Thanksgivings</hi> for so great a deliverance? It would be a very <hi>sensless</hi> and <hi>mute</hi> Remnant, if it were not so. But being so, there is a real agreement and harmony betwixt even this Etymon of <hi>Sardis,</hi> and those <hi>Songs</hi> and <hi>Doxologies</hi> above mentioned. But thirdly and lastly, To make <hi>Sar</hi> in <hi>Sardis</hi> to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie <hi>Reliquiae</hi> or a <hi>Remnant,</hi> in reference to the emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the <hi>Sardian</hi> Church upon the <hi>Rising</hi> of the <hi>Witnesses</hi> and the fall of <hi>Babylon</hi> is an <hi>apert Repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy</hi> or gross <hi>Nonsense,</hi> those Kingdoms and Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palities then gained by Christ out of the hands of Antichrist being the <hi>Primitiae</hi> of his Acquists by his Wars and Victories, not the <hi>Reliquiae,</hi> and a Pledge of greater Accessions to his Dominion to be made hereafter. So that this sense of <hi>Sar,</hi> which <hi>S. E.</hi> would have, is utterly unapplicable to the Church of <hi>Sardis.</hi> And therefore must, as the Expositor would have it, signifie <hi>Canticum,</hi> not <hi>Reliquiae,</hi> and <hi>Sardis</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="327" facs="tcp:48067:177"/>
merely that he might vent his <hi>boyish</hi> wit of <hi>think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>clinking,</hi> with which he seems as much <hi>tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi> as a <hi>Squirrel</hi> with the Musick she makes in her Wire-Cage, with Bells hanging over it.</p>

                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 283. <hi rend="sup">a</hi> Whereas it's said here, that as Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> has placed the <hi>Vials,</hi> onely the seventh fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth the sixth Trumpet; he hath placed <hi>all</hi> of them <hi>within</hi> the sixth Trumpet. <hi rend="sup">b</hi> For the <hi>Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian</hi> War on the suffering of <hi>Iohn Huss</hi> was many years after the taking of <hi>Constantinople</hi> by the <hi>Turks,</hi> at which the <hi>sixth Trumpet</hi> must commence, if not sooner. <hi rend="sup">c</hi> So that though onely the <hi>seventh Vial</hi> follows the expiring of the <hi>sixth Trumpet,</hi> yet all of them follow the commencement of it. <hi rend="sup">d</hi> And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as its argued that <hi>all</hi> the <hi>seven Vials</hi> must be <hi>after</hi> the <hi>seventh Trumpet,</hi> because they are called the seven <hi>last</hi> plagues; <hi rend="sup">e</hi> it's a strange <hi>crippling</hi> the sense of the words, to make them serve the end designed. But (as it's said in Remarks) they are most properly called the last plagues in respect of the precedent plagues of the <hi>Opened book,</hi> viz. those signified by the Monitions of the <hi>two precedent Angels,</hi> chap. 14. and the plagues the <hi>Witnesses</hi> smote the Earth with, <hi>chap.</hi> 11. yet also with respect to the Trumpets. But it's enough to denominate them the <hi>last</hi> Plagues, if they be the <hi>last Series</hi> of Plagues, though there be a <hi>former Series</hi> of Plagues <hi>unexpired</hi> when they began.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> This Remark abounds with mistakes. For, First, <hi rend="sup">a</hi> Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> has not placed <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Vials with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in</hi> the sixth Trumpet, as appears by all the printed Schemes of his <hi>Synchronisms</hi> that I have met with, in which the <hi>seventh Vial</hi> is placed within the <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:48067:178"/>
Trumpet.</hi> And besides, he says expresly in his little Treatise of <hi>Synchronisms,</hi> Part 2. Synchron. 3. <hi>Phiala septima quae consummationis phiala est concurret cum initio Tubae septimae.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="sup">b</hi> Secondly, He makes the <hi>Bohemian</hi> War on the suffering of <hi>Iohn Huss</hi> to be many years <hi>after</hi> the taking of <hi>Constantinople.</hi> Whenas the taking of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople</hi> by <hi>Sultan Muhamed</hi> was in the year 1453. but the <hi>Bellum Hussiticum</hi> in the year 1420, above thirty years before. But supposing it was as many years after, how does this prove that Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces all the Vials within the sixth Trumpet? He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed makes the <hi>Hussites</hi> concerned in the <hi>first</hi> Vial, but then the sooner the <hi>Bellum Hussiticum</hi> began, it were the more hopefull the Vials would end <hi>within</hi> the sixth Trumpet; but the arguing from the later beginning of that War, I must confess passeth my reach to discern what the force of the reasoning is, and the other way would be very little to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="sup">c</hi> Thirdly, He seems plainly to <hi>contradict</hi> himself in placing <hi>all</hi> the seven Vials <hi>within</hi> the <hi>sixth Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet</hi> before, and now letting the <hi>seventh</hi> Vial com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence <hi>after</hi> the <hi>expiring</hi> of the <hi>sixth Trumpet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="sup">d</hi> Fourthly, Another gross mistake of the Remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker is, in that he makes the Expositor to argue for the placing of all the seven Vials <hi>after</hi> the <hi>seventh</hi> Trumpet, whenas he argues onely for the placing them after the <hi>sixth.</hi> For <hi>after</hi> the <hi>seventh</hi> is after the end of the World. But his arguing for the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing them after the sixth Trumpet is very firm and strong. Because <hi>all seven</hi> of them are called the <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven last plagues,</hi> therefore not one of them is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin and expire before any of the <hi>six</hi> Trumpet-plagues,
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:48067:178"/>
or the second <hi>Wo-Trumpet</hi> or <hi>Plague-Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet</hi> expire, else that Vial that did so would not be one of the <hi>last</hi> plagues, this <hi>second Plague-Trumpet,</hi> suppose, being <hi>later</hi> than it, or <hi>expiring later</hi> than it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="sup">e</hi> And this is no <hi>crippling</hi> the sense of [last] but maintaining the proper sense thereof, and indeed the onely sense. For how can that be said <hi>in succession</hi> to be the <hi>last,</hi> that has a <hi>later,</hi> that <hi>outlasts</hi> it? And that the <hi>seven last plagues</hi> respect the <hi>six first plagues,</hi> and consequently the <hi>first</hi> and <hi>second Wo-Trumpet</hi> or <hi>Plague-Trumpets</hi> properly so called, the Remarker himself cannot deny. And the Plagues of the <hi>six Trumpets</hi> are the very Plagues that the <hi>Witnesses</hi> are said to smite the Earth withall. And it is wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully weak and freakish to run to the Vision in <hi>chap.</hi> 14. for a <hi>plague</hi> or <hi>two,</hi> in <hi>respect of which,</hi> the <hi>Vials</hi> may be called the <hi>seven last plagues,</hi> viz. to those of the <hi>two precedent Angels</hi> there. Whenas the former of them is no <hi>Plague-Angel,</hi> that is, no Inflicter of Plagues, but a <hi>Preacher</hi> of <hi>pure Worship,</hi> and an <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertizer</hi> of the approaching judgments of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Idolaters,</hi> and yet of <hi>no other</hi> than such as are comprized within the <hi>six first Trumpets,</hi> the <hi>fifth</hi> and <hi>sixth</hi> particularly; And the second a Declarer of that <hi>actual</hi> judgment befallen <hi>Babylon</hi> at the close of the <hi>sixth Trumpet</hi>; And then comes the <hi>third</hi> Angel, whose voice, according to the Remarker's own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, is onely a Premonition in general, touching all the seven Vial-plagues. Wherefore it is not a <hi>Plague it self,</hi> and no more were the <hi>Advertisements</hi> of the <hi>other two Angels.</hi> But I have really proved it to be a <hi>glance</hi> at the Plague of the <hi>fourth Vial,</hi> and that after the fall of <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>Rising of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,</hi>
                     <pb n="330" facs="tcp:48067:179"/>
which things are nothing to the tooth of <hi>S. E.</hi> the Remarker, but exceeding true.</p>
                  <p>And yet here I would have the Remarker to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve how unawares he has <hi>stumbled</hi> upon <hi>Truth,</hi> in making the third Angel a Premonitor of the seven last plagues, <hi>viz.</hi> the Vial-plagues and them to be last in respect of the plagues the <hi>first</hi> and <hi>second</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel give notice of, which undoubtedly are the plagues comprized within the Intervals of the <hi>first</hi> and <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Wo-Trumpets,</hi> or <hi>Plague-Trumpets,</hi> properly so called. The <hi>Vial-plagues,</hi> I say, are according to him the <hi>last plagues,</hi> in respect of the Plagues of <hi>those two</hi> Trumpets, which is the very thing I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for.</p>
                  <p>And lastly, whereas, he saith, It's enough to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominate them <hi>last Plagues,</hi> if they be the <hi>last Series</hi> of Plagues, though there be a <hi>former Series</hi> of Plagues unexpired when they begun, is a thing said, but not proved. Yea very <hi>harsh</hi> and <hi>repugnant</hi> it is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive. For whereas <hi>former</hi> and <hi>later</hi> here, is in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of <hi>Time,</hi> which is one <hi>single line</hi> of <hi>succession</hi>; whatever is terminated before a certain <hi>term</hi> thereof (as in the line <figure/> where the <hi>whole line</hi> of <hi>Time</hi> is <hi>AB,</hi> and <hi>B</hi> the utmost term thereof) is necessarily said to be <hi>before</hi> that <hi>Term,</hi> suppose <hi>B,</hi> and <hi>B</hi> to be later than it. So that none of those Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions <hi>Ac, cd, de, ef, fg,</hi> can be said to be <hi>later</hi> in <hi>succession</hi> (which is the thing look't at in such or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>time</hi>) than the <hi>whole AB.</hi> Those <hi>parts</hi> are indeed <hi>Synchronal</hi> to the <hi>parts</hi> of <hi>AB,</hi> but do not <hi>succeed</hi> it, and therefore cannot be <hi>later</hi> than it. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, if there were conceived two such <hi>Series</hi> or <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="331" facs="tcp:48067:179"/>
the former would be properly called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the latter <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, but if this were, the seven last plagues as to time and order they would have been called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, not <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which is the same with <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. But it being said <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the seven last plagues, the plea of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marker has no colour at all. For it being said of every one of them, that it is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, it must be so in respect of all the foregoing plagues in the former conceived <hi>Series,</hi> else it will be falsly called the <hi>last,</hi> nor would there be <hi>seven last</hi> plagues in number. For no more of the seven can be said in respect of the precedent plagues to be the last, than such as <hi>follow all the plagues precedent</hi> after they have expired, that is to say, Unless the first of the last plagues expire after the last of the former <hi>Series,</hi> the enunciation is false. This is the plain, easie and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural sense of things. And besides, by other demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strative reasons it has been proved above, that <hi>all the seven last plagues</hi> follow the <hi>sixth Trumpet,</hi> so that this <hi>Critical</hi> Altercation was the less needfull, and the rather because it is plain to any one at first sight, that is not blinded with prejudice, That <hi>every one</hi> of the <hi>seven last plagues</hi> must be <hi>later</hi> than <hi>any one</hi> of those plagues, <hi>in respect of which</hi> they are termed the <hi>last.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 285. There's a stronger Objection in <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks</hi> against the conceit of making the <hi>three days and an half</hi> of the Witnesses lying dead, signifie the same with <hi>three times and an half,</hi> than the second here mentioned, <hi>viz.</hi> That the dwellers on Earth are said to rejoice over them when they are slain, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they tormented them</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> by their prophesy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:48067:180"/>
and smiting the Earth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) but they <hi>prophesied</hi> 1260 <hi>days,</hi> and during that time smote the Earth with the plagues; Therefore this slaying of them, are rejoycing thereat <hi>for putting an end thereby to those Torments,</hi> must be after the 1260 days.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> The Expositor's second Objection is, which he answers in that page, <hi>That if the three days and an half be the same with the three times and an half, which is the same with the</hi> 1260 <hi>days or</hi> 42 <hi>months,</hi> (which are but various expressions of the three times and an half) <hi>then the Witnesses will be conceived to speak and prophesie while they lye dead.</hi> But now this <hi>stronger</hi> Objection of the <hi>Remarker,</hi> as he imagines it, which yet is not a jot stronger than the other, is this: That the dwellers on the Earth are said to rejoice over the Witnesses when they are slain, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they tormented them</hi> by their <hi>prophesying</hi> and <hi>smiting the Earth,</hi> but they <hi>prophesied</hi> 1260 <hi>days,</hi> and <hi>during that time smote the Earth</hi> with the plagues; Therefore this <hi>slaying of them</hi> and <hi>rejoicing thereat</hi> for putting an end thereby to those torments, <hi>must be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the</hi> 1260 <hi>days.</hi> This is a <hi>mighty</hi> argument with the <hi>Remarker.</hi> But his <hi>confidence</hi> therein ariseth out of his <hi>ignorance</hi> of the nature of a <hi>Prophetick Heno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poeia,</hi> which exhibits things done or suffered at <hi>seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times</hi> and <hi>repeatedly,</hi> under <hi>one shew,</hi> or at <hi>once,</hi> as if it were one <hi>continued Action</hi> or <hi>Suffering.</hi> The <hi>repeated</hi> therefore <hi>killing</hi> of the Witnesses, whether <hi>naturally</hi> or <hi>politically,</hi> as occasion was given, at <hi>seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times</hi> is expressed by <hi>one killing</hi> of them; The <hi>tormenting of the dwellers</hi> on Earth by the Witnesses prophesying at <hi>several</hi> times, is represented as <hi>one continued</hi> prophesying; And the <hi>Rejoicing</hi> of the dwellers upon Earth for their being <hi>rid of the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
                     <pb n="333" facs="tcp:48067:180"/>
the vexatious prophesying of these Witnesses put them to, being <hi>repeated as oft as the killing of the Witnesses was,</hi> at which they found themselves <hi>at ease, toties quoties,</hi> is yet exhibited under the <hi>shew</hi> of <hi>one Rejoicing.</hi> This is most certainly the nature of a <hi>Prophetick Henopoeia,</hi> to represent things <hi>thus,</hi> which the Remarker <hi>not considering,</hi> imagines a <hi>great strength</hi> in an Objection, which in reality has <hi>no strength</hi> at all.</p>

                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 289. <hi rend="sup">a</hi> As for the <hi>first</hi> Reason for the said conceit of the Witnesses, <hi>&amp;c. Apocalyptick Nasute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> and <hi>Sagacity</hi> will not lead one to hold an opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on against which there is such an <hi>unanswerable</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection as I take that now mentioned to be. <hi rend="sup">b</hi> As to the <hi>second</hi> Reason, <hi>Half a year</hi> in so <hi>short</hi> a time as three years and an half may be <hi>considerable</hi> to take notice of. And perhaps it may be also taken notice of in reference to the Profanation of the Temple by <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> and shutting up the Heavens from rain by <hi>Eliah</hi> (both which were for the same time) and so may have partly a <hi>Symbolical</hi> signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, <hi>viz.</hi> that this shall be a like short time of Trial, and have the like happy issue. And in <hi>Rev.</hi> 9.15. There is a prediction that reacheth to an <hi>Hour,</hi> which what sense is to be given thereof, this may admit of the same. And the time here signified seems to be like a <hi>short discord</hi> before a <hi>sweet close,</hi> and such a turn of affairs as was <hi>Iulian</hi>'s Apostacy before the <hi>establishment</hi> of <hi>Christianity</hi> in the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,</hi> and as also was the Relapse in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s days before the <hi>settlement</hi> of the <hi>Reformation</hi>; so is this such a turn before the advancement of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity to that <hi>Ascendent-state</hi> it will gain over its ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:48067:181"/>
by the <hi>Rising of the Witnesses.</hi> As to the <hi>third</hi> Reason, <hi rend="sup">c</hi> This condition of the Witnesses will not be <hi>so sad</hi> as is imagined, but they are likely to be very <hi>heart-whole,</hi> and to possess their souls in patience and comfortable hopes of what they have a prospect to be near at hand. And though it seems so incredible that they should <hi>recover</hi> in so short a time, yet it's not so, that the <hi>commencement</hi> of their Recovery should be within so short a time, but their <hi>Rising</hi> and absolute <hi>Recovery</hi> may continue long, though it will be to a much better condition than they were in before. <hi rend="sup">d</hi> As to the <hi>fourth</hi> Reason, The Apologer himself, saith he, makes their <hi>Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Death to be represented by their <hi>mournfull pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesying</hi> 1260 days; And it is also sufficiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest by the <hi>suffering none to buy or sell</hi> that hath not the <hi>mark</hi> of the Beast, and also sufficiently implied by the <hi>cruel War</hi> against them. For to be sure they would not be admitted to any Autority by those who were so enraged against them. <hi rend="sup">c</hi> As to the <hi>fifth</hi> Reason, This <hi>Persecution</hi> will chiefly respect (as I have said) the <hi>strickt restraining</hi> of them from <hi>tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting</hi> their adversaries as formerly. For having so prevailed as to be about to finish their mournfull Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony, and to begin to <hi>get the Ascedent</hi> of their Adversaries before this turn of affairs, their Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries jealousie of them by reason thereof, will make them use all watchfull diligence to keep them under. <hi rend="sup">f</hi> And this Answer includes an Answer to the <hi>sixth</hi> Reason, if it need any. For this is a different War from the former, being not to <hi>destroy,</hi> but <hi>silence</hi> and <hi>subdue.</hi>

                     <hi>Ans.</hi> He comes now to the Expositor's <hi>six</hi> Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, whereby he would prove that the three days and an half that the Witnesses are said to <hi>lye dead,</hi> are the same with the <hi>three times</hi> and <hi>an half,</hi> or 1260 days or 42 months. And to the first, which is taken from the obvious answering of <hi>three Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grals</hi> and <hi>an half,</hi> to <hi>three Integrals</hi> and <hi>an half,</hi> viz. <hi>Three days</hi> and <hi>an half</hi> to <hi>three times</hi> and <hi>an half,</hi> the same with the 1260 days and the 42 months, he saith, That Apocalyptick <hi>Nasuteness</hi> and <hi>Sagacity</hi> will not lead one to hold an Opinion, against which there is such an unanswerable Objection as the Objection even now mentioned. But I have shew'd it to be so far from being an unanswerable Objection, that I have fully answered it, with all <hi>ease</hi> and <hi>clearness</hi> imaginable. I will onely add, that <hi>Peganius,</hi> a very learned and pious Writer, is of that <hi>Apocalyptick Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacity</hi> and <hi>Nasuteness,</hi> that though he do not hold the Witnesses already risen, but that they are to rise in the year 1860, which is 177 years hence, yet he makes the <hi>three days</hi> and an <hi>half</hi> to be the same with the <hi>three times</hi> and an <hi>half</hi> or 1260 days.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="sup">b</hi> As for his Answer to the Expositor's <hi>second</hi> Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, (which is, That the Affectation of predicting to the <hi>curiosity</hi> of <hi>half a year</hi> is improbable) it is manifold. First, That half a year in so short a time as three years and an half, may be considerable. Secondly, That it may be taken notice of in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the profanation of the Temple by <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> and shutting up the Heavens from rain by <hi>Eliah,</hi> and may be a Symbol of the <hi>short conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance</hi> of the <hi>Trial,</hi> and the like happy issue. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That there is a prediction, <hi>Rev.</hi> 9.15. that reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to an <hi>hour,</hi> which what sense may be given there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:48067:182"/>
this may admit of the same. Fourthly and lastly, That it will be such a sudden turn of affairs as was <hi>Iulian</hi>'s Apostacy before the <hi>establishment</hi> of <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity</hi> in the <hi>Empire,</hi> and the Relapse in Queen <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>'s days before the <hi>settlement</hi> of the <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to the first I answer, That the whole three years and an half is so <hi>inconsiderable,</hi> that no such small Periods of time are Typified in all the Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lypse by <hi>any number</hi> set down therein, the very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>this Book of Prophecies</hi> being such as onely to prefigure the more large or general strokes of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Periods of time. So that to say <hi>half a year</hi> in respect of <hi>three years</hi> and an <hi>half</hi> is considerable, is a mere <hi>sophistical</hi> quibble. So <hi>half an hour</hi> would be in respect of <hi>three hours</hi> and an <hi>half,</hi> for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion is alike in both. The strength of the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is this, That the <hi>Apocalyptick</hi> Prophecies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to prefigure the state of no such small Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods of time by any number, as <hi>four years</hi> suppose, nay if you will of <hi>four times four years,</hi> that it is incredible that they should be so curious as to prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe the condition of just three years and an <hi>half,</hi> whenas if they had said roundly, four years, it would have served all intents and purposes that three years and an half could do.</p>
                  <p>To the second I answer, That the <hi>three years</hi> and an <hi>half</hi> of the <hi>Profanation</hi> of the Temple does rather confirm the Expositor's opinion that makes the <hi>three days</hi> and an <hi>half</hi> the <hi>three times</hi> and an <hi>half</hi> or 1260 days, the <hi>outward</hi> Court of the Temple being <hi>profa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi> or troden down by the <hi>Gentiles</hi> for that time, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Vision. So that as <hi>Antiochus Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> his profanation was a <hi>Type</hi> of the <hi>Profanation</hi> and
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:48067:182"/>
conculcation of the <hi>outer</hi> Court or <hi>holy City</hi> by the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> so the <hi>three years and an half</hi> is likewise a <hi>Type</hi> of <hi>that Time,</hi> they containing 1260 days to be expounded prophetically, as the three years and an half are to be expounded. And the like is to be said of the shutting up the Heavens from rain for <hi>three years and an half,</hi> that is, as is aforesaid for 1260 days, the time of the mournfull Witnesses, during which time the distilling of the salutiferous doctrine of the Gospel, which should descend upon the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as a refreshing Rain was hindred. Which far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confirms that the <hi>three days</hi> and an <hi>half</hi> is <hi>three times</hi> and an <hi>half,</hi> and refers to the state of things in the 1260 days of the mournfull Witnesses. And that therefore the three years and an half of <hi>Antiochus</hi> his Profanation of the Temple, and the shutting up the Heavens from Rain by <hi>Elias,</hi> are no Symbols of a <hi>short</hi> continuance of the <hi>Trial,</hi> though they may be of the happy issue of things in the Conclusion.</p>
                  <p>To the third I answer, That [Hour] <hi>Apoc.</hi> 9.15. signifies there the same that <hi>time</hi>; And if <hi>half a day</hi> here will be admitted to signifie <hi>half a time,</hi> the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marker and Expositor are agreed. For I hope he will not stick when he has once admitted that the <hi>half day</hi> signifies <hi>half a time,</hi> to acknowledge that the <hi>three days</hi> will signifie <hi>three times</hi>; so that then it will be, <hi>Three times</hi> and an <hi>half,</hi> or a <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Times</hi> and <hi>half a Time,</hi> as <hi>Daniel</hi> has it, which is the thing the Expositor contends for.</p>
                  <p>To the fourth and last I say, That the turn of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs were <hi>very sudden indeed</hi> upon <hi>Iulian</hi>'s shorter reign than half of three years and an half; and his Successors, as he before them, being Emperours of the whole <hi>Roman</hi> Empire might quickly re-establish
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:48067:183"/>
the Christian Religion therein; But if once the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed</hi> Kingdoms and States, or People were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run again with Popery, there being no one Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour or Head over them all, the Remarker's conceit is not credible. And as for Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s reign, it was almost twice three years and an half, and that Recession respected onely the Dominions she was Queen of. So that if in her time there had been as many Nations overflown again with Popery, as have now been converted from it to the Gospel, the rest of the Witnesses would have been left in the lurch, and lain still in the dead slate they were in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. But the Rising ought to be general, unless there be some thing intimated to the contrary. But lastly, it is not enough for the fulfilling of the Remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker's sense of <hi>these three days and an half,</hi> that there be a sudden turn of things, but that the <hi>ill plight</hi> of the Witnesses should be confined to just <hi>three years and an half,</hi> which is a thing not onely incredible, but even ridiculous for one to conceive. But yet, all that is brought, which does not evince this, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpose. And I am confident nothing will ever be brought to evince it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="sup">c</hi> The Remarker's Answer to the Expositor's <hi>third</hi> Reason, which is, That if the State of the Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church be ever brought to so sad a condition as is represented by the <hi>karcases of the two Witnesses</hi> lying dead in the streets of the great City, it is <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible</hi> they should recover again within the space of three years and an half. To elude the force of this argument, the Remarker <hi>point blank against</hi> the description of the condition of the <hi>slain</hi> Witnesses, first makes their state more <hi>joyous</hi> and <hi>comfortable</hi> than can possibly comply with that <hi>sad</hi> Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:48067:183"/>
of them in the Type thereof. They are <hi>slain</hi> by the <hi>Beast</hi> out of the <hi>Bottomless pit,</hi> and their <hi>dead bodies lye exposed</hi> in the street of the great City. What a <hi>comfortable</hi> and <hi>heart-whole</hi> condition is this? The best that can be said of it is, They are in the state of Death for the present, but may in time be raised out of it. But for the present time, what can be more dismal and sad? And the other trick of <hi>evading</hi> is, That though it seems so incredible that the Witnesses should <hi>recover</hi> in so short a time, yet it is not so that the <hi>commencement</hi> of their <hi>recovery</hi> should be within so short a time. To which I say it is altogether <hi>incredible,</hi> that it will ever appear that Popery has overflown the <hi>Reformed</hi> Nations, States and Kingdoms for that short space of three years and an half just, and then at the expiring of that half year the Recovery of the Witnesses should presently commence, the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> as I noted above, having no aim to design such small moments of time, nor it being at all probable that the Pope and his Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy, having once again got the reins into their own hands, of <hi>Western</hi> Christendom should not by their notable policy and vigilancy be able to retain their power <hi>entire,</hi> for above three years and an half together. And then in the second place I add, there is <hi>no such distinction</hi> discernible in the Vision as to make a difference betwixt their <hi>Recovery,</hi> and the <hi>commencement</hi> of their Recovery: Unless one would conceive that <hi>the spirit of life from God</hi> entering into them and their <hi>standing on their feet</hi> to be the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement</hi> of their Recovery, and their ascending in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heaven in a Cloud the <hi>Recovery it self.</hi> But being their <hi>Death</hi> from which they are revived, is a <hi>Political</hi> Death; <hi>so soon</hi> as they were <hi>alive,</hi> they
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:48067:184"/>
were <hi>Politically</hi> alive, and their ascending into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven upon a call thither is but a more full expression of the same state, or may regard more properly those of the Witnesses that were called to the <hi>higher</hi> Ranks of <hi>Political</hi> Offices and Honours.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="sup">d</hi> The Expositor's fourth Reason is, That if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain the lying dead of the Witnesses to the <hi>three years</hi> and an <hi>half</hi> at the <hi>end</hi> of their prophesying, there is nothing in the Vision to represent their <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical Death</hi> (to which their <hi>Resurrection</hi> relates) before that time, though they have been dead in that sense at least 1260 years already. To which the Remarker answers, That the Apologer himself makes the Witnesses <hi>Political Death</hi> to be represented by their mournfull prophesying 1260 days, and it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so sufficiently expressed by <hi>suffering none to buy and sell,</hi> and by the <hi>cruel War</hi> against them. But to this I reply, That the Apologer of Expositor does not make their <hi>Political Death</hi> to be represented by their mournfull prophesying 1260 days, but makes it onely <hi>synchronize</hi> therewith. And for the rest of the Remarker's Answer, it is <hi>impertinent</hi> to the Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's Reason, who says there is nothing in <hi>this</hi> Vision of the <hi>Witnesses</hi> that sets out their <hi>Political</hi> Death for 1260 years together, though it mention their <hi>Resurrection.</hi> So that this Vision must be wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly maimed according to this false Gloss the Remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker puts upon it. And though there be <hi>war</hi> and <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercoming,</hi> and <hi>forbidding to buy or sell</hi> mentioned in the next Vision, yet <hi>that</hi> Vision is not <hi>this,</hi> nor is their <hi>Death</hi> there mentioned, which is <hi>Antithetal</hi> to <hi>Resurrection</hi> from the <hi>Dead.</hi> And besides, <hi>chap.</hi> 13. <hi>vers.</hi> 7. It is onely said that it was given to the Beast <hi>to make war with the Saints, and to overcome them,</hi>
                     <pb n="341" facs="tcp:48067:184"/>
which does not at all imply their Political Death <hi>for</hi> 1260 <hi>years,</hi> for they may <hi>overcome</hi> them onely at the last at the end, as in the <hi>letter</hi> of the Vision, <hi>chap.</hi> 11. <hi>vers.</hi> 7. Nor does the <hi>prohibiting</hi> to <hi>buy</hi> and <hi>sell</hi> imply that Death of the Witnesses <hi>for</hi> 1260 <hi>years</hi> together, there being no intimation of the <hi>extent of time</hi> in the business. Whence there is a necessity that the <hi>three days</hi> and an <hi>half,</hi> which is the <hi>three times</hi> and an <hi>half,</hi> equivalent to 1260 days, must denote the Time of the <hi>Political</hi> Death of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, that the 42 <hi>months War,</hi> and the <hi>Beast's over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming the Saints,</hi> chap. 13. vers. 5. both the <hi>victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> and <hi>war</hi> may be expounded accordingly, as equal to, and coincident with the <hi>three days</hi> and an <hi>half,</hi> or <hi>three times</hi> and an <hi>half,</hi> and to <hi>the</hi> 1260 <hi>days.</hi> Whence we may understand that this Answer of the Remarker is most miserably forced, weak, and far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetched.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="sup">e</hi> The Expositor's fifth Reason is, That being the Witnesses have <hi>lain slain</hi> in a <hi>Political</hi> sense so long, and have been <hi>so often slain,</hi> even many hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of them in a <hi>natural</hi> sense, before the end of their mournfull Witnessing, it is unconceivable what persecution or oppression in these <hi>last three years</hi> and an <hi>half</hi> different from what they had endured before, should befall them, or more worthy taking notice of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the <hi>former</hi> should be <hi>omitted,</hi> and <hi>these</hi> by the <hi>karcases lying three days and an half in the street,</hi> be represented. The answer of the Remarker here is very <hi>slim</hi> and lank to this fifth Reason, he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging the <hi>persecution</hi> and <hi>oppression</hi> for these three days and an half, nothing comparable to the <hi>seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities</hi> of that in the 1260 days of the mournfull pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesying of the Witnesses; but discreetly letteth slip
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:48067:185"/>
the main question, why so <hi>gentle</hi> a persecution in comparison, and of so <hi>small continuance,</hi> should be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Vision, and one more than <hi>three hundred times</hi> longer for duration, and more <hi>bloudy, rude</hi> and <hi>barbarous</hi> for all manner of cruelty, should be omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. This he wisely declines to say any thing to, it being such as to which nothing can be said.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="sup">f</hi> The Expositor's sixth and last Reason is this, That whereas it is said, <hi>vers.</hi> 7. <hi>And when they shall have finished their Testimony, the Beast that ascend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them, and shall overcome them and kill them:</hi> that unless his sense be admitted, there is till the end of their prophesying <hi>neither</hi> any <hi>war,</hi> nor any <hi>overcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> nor any <hi>killing</hi> of the Witnesses, which is point blank against the truth of History. What says the Remarker to this? His former Answer, says he, is an Answer to this, if it need any. For this is a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent war, saith he, from the former, being not to <hi>destroy,</hi> but to <hi>silence</hi> and <hi>subdue.</hi> And yet <hi>this</hi> is notified, and the <hi>other</hi> omitted. What will not one say that is wedded to a fond opinion? But the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion does not onely <hi>omit</hi> the forty two months war against the Witnesses, and that continued slaughter either <hi>Political</hi> or <hi>Natural</hi> above three hundred times of longer continuance than this <hi>slighter</hi> distress of <hi>three days</hi> and an <hi>half,</hi> but does naturally import that there was <hi>no war</hi> against the Witnesses till they <hi>had finished</hi> their 1260 days witnessing, if we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to the <hi>cortical</hi> sense as the <hi>Remarker</hi> does; which is point blank against the truth of History. For the Text saith, And when they <hi>shall have finished</hi> their Testimony, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Bestia illa ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens</hi> (so <hi>Beza</hi>) which S. <hi>Iohn</hi> had his eye upon,
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:48067:185"/>
                     <hi>That Beast ascending out of the bottomless-pit, shall make war against them,</hi> &amp;c. Which implies he came out of the pit just upon the finishing their Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, (when they had said their say) to assault them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As it is said, <hi>chap.</hi> 13. upon the wrath of the Dragon against the seed of the woman, and his resolution of making war against them, that S. <hi>Iohn</hi> saw <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>a Beast ascending out of the Sea,</hi> which implies the <hi>first</hi> appearance of him. And the very words, <hi>When they shall have finished their Testimony, the Beast shall make war against them,</hi> does plainly and naturally imply he shall not war against them before, but that then coming out of the Pit, or out of the Sea, he will presently set upon them. He that can shut his eyes against such plain truth, I pray God he may not become blind for ever.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 291. Whereas it is supposed there hath been such <hi>evident</hi> proof that the <hi>Vials</hi> follow the <hi>Rising</hi> of the <hi>Witnesses,</hi> the contrary, I suppose, hath been made sufficiently evident; whereby the <hi>fansied</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical Evidence, that the <hi>Reformation</hi> must be the <hi>Rising</hi> of the <hi>Witnesses,</hi> comes to nothing. And the change by the <hi>Reformation</hi> was not so vast and stupendious (as it's here said to be) but that it's sufficiently prophesied of by the <hi>second Vial,</hi> which does very aptly signifie it, it consisting chiefly in <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting the Pope's Autority</hi> with <hi>some</hi> corruptions, which were incident to the owning of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> This last Remark is nothing but a <hi>Triumph</hi> before <hi>Victory,</hi> he supposing he hath produced such Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections as do enervate the <hi>Expositor</hi>'s arguments for the placing the <hi>Vials</hi> after the <hi>Rising</hi> of the <hi>Witnesses,</hi> whenas in truth all his Objections are as weak as wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:48067:186"/>
and as tender as any Cobweb, as I have mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly shewn; nor is there any unprejudiced eye but will easily discern it, and consequently that, the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation</hi> begun by <hi>Luther</hi> is the <hi>Rising</hi> of the <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,</hi> is no <hi>fancy,</hi> as the Remarker <hi>reproachfully</hi> calls it, but a <hi>solid Truth,</hi> and even of <hi>Mathematical</hi> Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and clearness. And whereas he would lessen that <hi>Illustrious</hi> passage of Providence the <hi>Reformation,</hi> (which of a truth was very glorious and stupendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous) by saying it consisted chiefly in rejecting the <hi>Pope's Autority</hi> with <hi>some</hi> corruptions incident to the owning of it; I say here in <hi>England</hi> for example, not onely the <hi>Pope's Autority</hi> was rejected, but <hi>all</hi> the <hi>corruptions</hi> of that Church that can be properly called <hi>Antichristian,</hi> and such as are described in the <hi>Expositor</hi>'s <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>Antichristianism:</hi> From the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of all which he has solidly and impartially vindicated the Church of <hi>England</hi> at the End of his <hi>Synopsis Prophetica,</hi> as any one may fully understand that reades that Vindication without prejudice. So that the Constitution of things as to the worship of God is reduced to the state of those times that are <hi>Symmetral,</hi> before the <hi>Apostacy</hi> came in. This has the <hi>ineffable</hi> goodness of God by his Providence brought to pass, but that <hi>we</hi> have made no <hi>better use</hi> of it, of whatever party we are, lyes at our own doors. And a sad reckoning I fear will fall to <hi>their</hi> share that <hi>grumble</hi> and <hi>murmur</hi> against so laudable a constitution of things, under which they may live an <hi>holy, innocent</hi> and <hi>Apostolick</hi> life here, and hereafter arrive thereby to eternal glory.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The works of the flesh,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>are mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest, which are these, Adultery, Fornication, Vnclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Lasciviousness, Idolatry, Witchcraft, Hatred, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance,
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:48067:186"/>
Emulation, Wrath, Strife, Sedition, Heresies, Envyings, Murthers, Drunkenness, Revellings,</hi> and the like; of which the Apostle tells us, that <hi>they that doe such things shall not inherit the Kingdom of God. But the fruit of the Spirit is Love, Ioy, Peace, Long-suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, Gentleness, Goodness, Faith, Meekness, Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</hi> And as to the <hi>former</hi> he saith, That <hi>they that are Christ's, have crucified the flesh, with the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and lusts.</hi> And as to the <hi>latter</hi> he admonisheth; <hi>If we live in the spirit, let us also walk in the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But now if we <hi>crucifie</hi> the <hi>one,</hi> and <hi>live</hi> and <hi>walk</hi> in the <hi>other,</hi> shall we not then be in reality, no <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited</hi> and <hi>presumptuous Saints,</hi> so fansied by our <hi>selves onely,</hi> or by our <hi>own party,</hi> but <hi>truly</hi> become <hi>such</hi> in the <hi>sight of God</hi> and <hi>all discerning</hi> people? And this assuredly those may attain unto, who under the dispensation of God's Providence are called unto the Communion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> if they be not wanting to themselves in the use of the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages thereof. And if so, what can the <hi>cavilling</hi> at, and <hi>calumniating</hi> the Constitution of things, what the <hi>vilifying</hi> and <hi>speaking contemptibly</hi> of them, and what the <hi>Insensibleness</hi> of the wickedness of <hi>Schisms</hi> and <hi>Divisions</hi>; what can these proceed from, but from the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Hypocrisie,</hi> which would <hi>seem</hi> some <hi>extraordinary</hi> thing in Religion, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it's nothing but its <hi>mere self,</hi> that is, a <hi>proud, Hypocritical,</hi> and many times <hi>Hypochondriacal Spirit</hi> fermenting and swelling it self into a conceit of its <hi>affecting a more perfect state</hi> of <hi>Holiness</hi> and <hi>Saintship</hi> than is consistent with communion with the publick Religion established by Divine Providence, here in <hi>England</hi> suppose; but in the mean time <hi>it self</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

I say, if they would <hi>examine themselves</hi> whether they <hi>doe thus</hi> or <hi>no,</hi> whether they have <hi>mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified,</hi> or at least do sincerely <hi>endeavour to mortifie</hi> all those works of the flesh there mentioned, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any way a-kin to them; and whether they be <hi>revived</hi> into those <hi>fruits</hi> of the <hi>spirit</hi> there specified, and have <hi>a real savour</hi> and <hi>rellish</hi> of them, and are <hi>ashamed</hi> in <hi>themselves,</hi> and perceive it a <hi>burthen to them,</hi> to find themselves in any other Temper, this is the onely way for them to <hi>discover</hi> their own <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie,</hi> and to bring them into a true method of becoming <hi>real Saints</hi> indeed. And this they may be, holding communion with the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as I shew'd above. But to bear themselves high in their own conceit, for their <hi>pragmatically</hi> fansying (rather than espying) faults in the Constitutions of a Church so well established, and to have a huge zeal for a purer <hi>external</hi> Reformation of the <hi>Publick,</hi> while that <hi>private internal</hi> Reformation (upon a false satisfaction of mind from that zeal for an <hi>outward</hi>) is so <hi>blindly</hi> neglected; this is the most effectual method I know to make them <hi>become,</hi> and <hi>ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main haughty</hi> and <hi>headstrong</hi> Hypocrites, and as to all <hi>true</hi> and <hi>real, spiritual Religion</hi> very cold and dough-baked Christians. This <hi>high, haughty,</hi> but really <hi>empty</hi> Schismatical Spirit is the very <hi>pest</hi> of the <hi>Reformed</hi> Churches, and I pray God it may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver prove the <hi>utter Ruine</hi> and <hi>Destruction</hi> of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</hi> And let this serve for a <hi>Return</hi> to the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marker</hi>'s <hi>rude</hi> and <hi>irreverent</hi> scorn and contempt he
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:48067:188"/>
has cast upon the <hi>Reformation</hi>; wherein <hi>Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence it self suffers,</hi> and his <hi>Spirit of Prophecy,</hi> who has plainly declared it to be the <hi>Rising of the Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> as has been above demonstrated, mauger all the pretended Objections of the <hi>conceited</hi> Remarker.</p>
                  <p>But now lastly, Whereas the Remarker will have the <hi>Reformation</hi> sufficiently prophesied of by the <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Vial</hi> onely, it is a thing utterly incredible that so <hi>glorious</hi> a passage of Providence should be passed over with so short and slight an intimation; which is onely this: <hi>The second Angel poured out his Vial on the Sea, and it became as the bloud of a dead man, and every living soul dyed in the Sea.</hi> This is all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to him that prefigures this <hi>stupendious</hi> pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of Providence; whenas the <hi>Victory</hi> of the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Christianity</hi> over <hi>Paganism</hi> is set out most <hi>magnificently</hi> and <hi>copiously</hi> at the opening of the sixth Seal, <hi>chap.</hi> 6.12. as also again by the <hi>victory</hi> of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael</hi> over the <hi>red Dragon,</hi> chap. 12.7. and there are great <hi>Acclamations</hi> and <hi>Rejoicings</hi> thereupon; But according to the mind of the <hi>Remarker</hi> the <hi>victory</hi> of the <hi>Evangelical</hi> Christians over <hi>Antichrist</hi> and <hi>horrid Enemy</hi> of the <hi>Church of Christ,</hi> and over <hi>Pagano-christianism</hi> consisting of many <hi>gross Superstitions,</hi> and <hi>multifarious Idolatries,</hi> and <hi>execrable Cruelties</hi> and <hi>Butcherings,</hi> nothing inferiour to those of the <hi>red Dragon</hi>; all this is hudled up into two or three lines without any <hi>Acclamations of Ioy, Doxologies</hi> or <hi>Songs of Thanksgiving</hi> for such an inestimable Mercy, which yet to such a vast atchievement of Providence, according to the usual mode of the Apocalypse, ought expresly to have been annexed. Wherefore though the <hi>second Vial</hi> may be a <hi>Type</hi> of the <hi>settled state</hi> of the <hi>Reformation</hi> after some short Reciproca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:48067:188"/>
of affairs after the Rising of the Witnesses, yet it cannot be in any reason or congruity of sense re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted the <hi>Type</hi> of the <hi>Reformation</hi> it self in its <hi>first</hi> and <hi>fresh</hi> appearance, which is most properly the <hi>Rising</hi> of the <hi>Witnesses,</hi> and upon which are those <hi>joyfull Acclamations</hi> and <hi>Doxologies,</hi> or <hi>Songs of Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving,</hi> chap. 11.15, 16, 17. as the Expositor by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exceptionable and invincible Arguments has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
                  <p>And then in the second place, As it is <hi>incongru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> to conceive the <hi>second Vial</hi> to be the <hi>onely</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick <hi>Type</hi> of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> so it is also <hi>impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> it should be so. For it being so <hi>firmly demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> that the <hi>Vials, all</hi> of them follow the <hi>Rising of the Witnesses,</hi> if the <hi>second Vial</hi> be the <hi>onely Type</hi> of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> it will yet follow, that the <hi>Rising</hi> of the <hi>Witnesses</hi> (which is also repugnant to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marker's Hypothesis) is already past, the <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> together with the <hi>second Vial,</hi> according to the Remarker, being already come; and therefore I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of him, what event of <hi>Providence,</hi> which is <hi>past,</hi> is prefigured by the <hi>Rising of the Witnesses.</hi> None certainly can be found but the <hi>fresh</hi> appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the <hi>Reformation</hi> before its perfect settlement. It is <hi>that</hi> which was prefigured by the <hi>Rising of the Witnesses</hi>; and the <hi>Settlement</hi> thereof by the <hi>second Vial.</hi> The <hi>Interval</hi> betwixt is the <hi>first Vial,</hi> viz. The intoxicating cup of wrath, envy and dementa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on those that had the mark of the Beast, with their <hi>unsuccessfull</hi> endeavours therefrom, to <hi>extinguish</hi> the <hi>Reformation</hi> in its first appearance, and in its first freshness and tenderness to have strangled it, as the Serpents sent from <hi>Iuno</hi> would have done <hi>Hercules</hi> in his Cradle. Thus easie is Wisedom to him that
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:48067:189"/>
understands; But a confused and prejudiced mind will intricate all things.</p>
                  <p>But he that has a mind <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>unprejudiced,</hi> cannot fail of assurance in this present point, if in reading the <hi>two first Visions</hi> of the <hi>Opened book,</hi> he closely observe these few things following;</p>
                  <p>First, That the two Visions begin from the same <hi>Epocha</hi> (I mean the Visions comprized, the <hi>first of them,</hi> in the eleventh Chapter, and the <hi>other</hi> in the twelfth, thirteenth and fourteenth Chapters) which that they do has been demonstrated in my Answer to the Remarks on the place, and granted in some sense by the Remarker himself; And that they end in the <hi>same times,</hi> viz. with the <hi>last Vial,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains a full and final overthrow of <hi>Babylon,</hi> or the <hi>Beast</hi> and <hi>false Prophet,</hi> which is manifestly proved by me against the Remarker. So that these two first Visions are Synchronal.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That both the <hi>first</hi> and <hi>second</hi> Vision contain a <hi>War</hi> with the <hi>Beast,</hi> and that the <hi>event</hi> of that war is an <hi>actual,</hi> but <hi>partial</hi> overthrow of the <hi>Beast</hi> or <hi>Babylon,</hi> called the <hi>great City,</hi> as is manifest from <hi>chap.</hi> 11. <hi>vers.</hi> 11, 12, 13. unto which answers the <hi>actual</hi> fall of <hi>Babylon</hi> in the second Vision. Which must needs be <hi>actual,</hi> else the Angel would speak an untruth, <hi>chap.</hi> 14. <hi>vers.</hi> 8. and but <hi>partial,</hi> because it both answers to that in the <hi>first</hi> Vision, and precedes the <hi>seventh Vial</hi> in the second, before which the full and final overthrow of <hi>Babylon</hi> is not. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, <hi>Prophecy is anticipatory History,</hi> and yet no <hi>actual</hi> success of the forty two months war, but <hi>this fall of Babylon</hi> is prefigured in this <hi>second Vision,</hi> it is plain that this is the <hi>success</hi> thereof, and therefore the very <hi>same</hi> with the <hi>partial fall</hi> of the <hi>great City</hi>
                     <pb n="351" facs="tcp:48067:189"/>
and <hi>Rising</hi> of the <hi>Witnesses</hi> in the first Vision. Which was in the <hi>last half</hi> day of the three days and an half, or in the <hi>last half time</hi> of the three times and an half. Whence the <hi>fall of Babylon</hi> the Angel brings news of must be so too, and not before, because the upshot of that war also was not till then.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That forasmuch as the <hi>fall of Babylon</hi> in the <hi>second Vision</hi> is the <hi>same</hi> with the <hi>fall</hi> of the <hi>great City</hi> and <hi>Rising of the Witnesses</hi> in the <hi>first,</hi> and this latter is just at the <hi>close</hi> of the <hi>sixth Trumpet,</hi> the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer must be so, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>fall of Babylon</hi> must be at the <hi>close</hi> of the <hi>sixth Trumpet</hi> also.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Forasmuch as this <hi>fall</hi> of <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>Rising</hi> of the <hi>Witnesses</hi> is an ample <hi>Object</hi> of <hi>Ioy</hi> and <hi>Thanksgiving</hi> to the <hi>Evangelici,</hi> the <hi>Witnesses</hi> and <hi>sealed Souldiers</hi> of the <hi>Lamb,</hi> against whom the Beast warred, and was too hard for them all along, though they held out through <hi>patience,</hi> and <hi>faith,</hi> and <hi>hope</hi> of <hi>promised success</hi> at last, <hi>chap.</hi> 13. <hi>vers.</hi> 9, 10. therefore as there is a <hi>joyfull message</hi> by an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of the <hi>actual fall</hi> of <hi>Babylon</hi> in the <hi>second Vision,</hi> chap. 14. vers. 8. so it is impossible but those <hi>Accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations</hi> in Heaven and <hi>Doxology</hi> of the <hi>Elders,</hi> chap. 11. vers. 15, 16, 17. should respect the <hi>partial,</hi> but <hi>actual</hi> fall of the <hi>City</hi> and <hi>Rising</hi> of the <hi>Witnesses,</hi> it being so ample an Object of those <hi>joyfull Acclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> and of that thankfull <hi>Doxology,</hi> and there being nothing betwixt but the gracefull ushering them in with the <hi>sound</hi> of the <hi>seventh Trumpet.</hi> Whence it is plain they respect that event, as it is also from that passage in the Doxology it self, <hi>vers.</hi> 27. where thanks is given to God Almighty, <hi>because he has ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to him his great power, and hath reigned,</hi> viz. in that fall of the <hi>great City</hi> and <hi>Rising</hi> of the <hi>Witnesses</hi>;
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:48067:190"/>
in this he re-assumed a considerable part of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom which <hi>Antichrist</hi> had usurped.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly therefore, We being so well assured that the <hi>partial</hi> fall of <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>Rising</hi> of the <hi>Witnesses</hi> is the <hi>Object</hi> of the joyfull <hi>Annunciation</hi> of the second Angel, <hi>chap.</hi> 14. and of the <hi>Doxology</hi> of the <hi>Elders, chap.</hi> 11. and meeting in the very <hi>next Vision,</hi> viz. that of the <hi>Vials,</hi> with a Song (prefixt thereto) of praise and thanksgiving by the <hi>Victors</hi> over the <hi>Beast</hi> for an <hi>actual,</hi> but <hi>partial</hi> Victory (<hi>actual,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is said therein, <hi>chap.</hi> 15. <hi>vers.</hi> 4. <hi>For thy judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are made manifest,</hi> viz. in this <hi>late</hi> fall of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> which yet is but <hi>partial,</hi> because this Song is <hi>prefixt</hi> before the <hi>Vials,</hi> which are to bring to pass the <hi>fall</hi> and <hi>final</hi> ruine thereof) and there being no precedent <hi>actual</hi> and <hi>partial</hi> victory but this in the <hi>fall</hi> of the <hi>City</hi> and <hi>Rising</hi> of the <hi>Witnesses,</hi> which may be the <hi>Object</hi> of this <hi>Song</hi> of <hi>Thanksgiving,</hi> like that of <hi>Moses</hi> upon the overthrow of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> at the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> it is impossible but <hi>this Song</hi> must be to the <hi>same</hi> effect with the <hi>Doxology</hi> of the <hi>Elders,</hi> and syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chronize with it.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly therefore, It is as clear as noon-day, That, that <hi>Doxology</hi> of the <hi>Elders</hi> immediately following the <hi>sixth Trumpet,</hi> this <hi>Song</hi> of <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Lamb</hi> must immediately follow the sixth Trumpet.</p>
                  <p>And lastly, All the <hi>Vials</hi> following the <hi>Song</hi> of <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Lamb,</hi> that they all follow the <hi>sixth Trumpet</hi> and the <hi>Rising</hi> of the <hi>Witnesses,</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, there being no part of the <hi>two first</hi> Visions of the <hi>Opened book</hi> (which begin from <hi>one Epocha,</hi> and end with the <hi>seventh Vial</hi>) that prefigures that <hi>notable,</hi> and indeed <hi>stupendious</hi> Atchievement of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> in causing so many Provinces, Principalities,
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:48067:190"/>
Nations and Kingdoms to cast off the Pope in the <hi>late Reformation,</hi> unless this of the <hi>partial fall</hi> of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi> and <hi>Rising</hi> of the <hi>Witnesses</hi> (for <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Vials</hi> are after their Rising) it necessarily follows that the aforesaid <hi>Reformation</hi> is the <hi>partial fall</hi> of <hi>Babylon</hi> and the <hi>Rising of the Witnesses,</hi> which was the thing to be demonstrated.</p>
                  <p>And this succinct <hi>Master-Reason</hi> of the <hi>Expositor,</hi> as I may so call it, may go for a more <hi>general</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of all his particular <hi>Reasonings</hi> on this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, (though they are sufficiently firm also of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves) and shews how <hi>skilfully</hi> he has allotted the <hi>several</hi> passages of the <hi>two Visions</hi> that <hi>follow</hi> the <hi>fall of Babylon</hi> and <hi>Rising</hi> of the <hi>Witnesses,</hi> to <hi>several</hi> of the <hi>Vials,</hi> which are certainly in that time after the said <hi>Fall</hi> and <hi>Rising.</hi> It shews also the assuredness of his judgment in making the <hi>three days and an half,</hi> that the Witnesses lye slain to be the <hi>same</hi> with the <hi>three times and an half</hi> or 1260 days, and that the Expositor's six arguments for it, as they are <hi>rational</hi> in themselves, so they conclude a <hi>certain Truth,</hi> and that the <hi>Remarker</hi>'s <hi>Answers</hi> to them are mere <hi>Whif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</hi> For the <hi>late Reformation</hi> being <hi>demonstrated</hi> to be the <hi>Rising of the Witnesses,</hi> all the Remarker's <hi>conceits</hi> about this matter are quite out of doors.</p>
                  <p>These are the <hi>genuine Corollaries</hi> of this solid De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration, as to <hi>speculation,</hi> but as to <hi>use</hi> this <hi>one</hi> is <hi>inestimable,</hi> That it naturally gives a stop, with all that are not out of their wits, to their conceiving any hopes of Innovations in State or Church from the <hi>near approach</hi> of the <hi>Rising</hi> of the <hi>Witnesses,</hi> the completion of that Prophecy being so <hi>plainly past:</hi> And farthermore, for the quieting of their Spirits
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:48067:191"/>
does plainly inform them of the <hi>Excellency</hi> of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation</hi> made by our <hi>Reverend</hi> and <hi>Royal Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers</hi> here in <hi>England,</hi> and that therefore to separate from such a constitution so well <hi>approved</hi> of by <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Testimony,</hi> is a piece of <hi>gross disobedience</hi> to the <hi>Magistrate,</hi> and <hi>hatefull Ingratitude</hi> to the <hi>goodness</hi> of God, and his <hi>benign Providence</hi> over his <hi>Church.</hi>

                  <p>WHile my Answers to the foregoing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks were in the Press, by a lucky Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence there came into my hands cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Apocalyptick Papers sent me in a Letter from a friend, who desired my judgment touching them. The Papers were the more welcome, because the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of them seemed to be convinced of that grand truth contended for by Dr. <hi>H. M.</hi> in his <hi>Apology,</hi> viz. <hi>That the Protestant Reformation was the Rising of the Witnesses.</hi> To which that Authour addeth also, that they rose in the year of our Lord 1559, but that their mournfull Prophesying did not conter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate, as naturally it doth, with their Resurrection and Ascension, but was to continue 127 years lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and to expire in the year 1686. In which year he declares with a strange scheme of <hi>Enthusia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick</hi> confidence, that <hi>Babylon</hi> will be utterly ruined, and all Antichristianity quite rooted out of the Church. Which look't so like an <hi>intended</hi> defeat to
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:48067:193"/>
the <hi>important</hi> usefulness of the assurance of the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, That <hi>the Witnesses are risen already,</hi> which is the quieting mens minds, and preventing stirs and commotions, and the conciliating a good opinion of the present constitution of things in matters of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Religion here in <hi>England,</hi> that I thought I was obliged the more narrowly to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the grounds of so Triumphant a conclusion; And especially (my friend in his Letter pressing me the most earnestly thereto) to settle according to my best judgment the <hi>Epocha</hi> of the <hi>Medial Visions,</hi> which the Authour of those Papers makes to be the year of our Lord 426. Which depends upon his making the <hi>Epocha</hi> of the <hi>Sealed-book-prophecy</hi> and the <hi>Opened-book-prophecy</hi> to be the year 66, in which he supposes that S. <hi>Iohn</hi> received those Prophecies in the reign of <hi>Nero.</hi> Wherefore to demonstrate the folly of that Enthusiastick confidence in the Authour of those Papers, according to my friend's desire, I have here settled the true <hi>Epocha</hi> of the <hi>Medial Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,</hi> or of the Apostasie or Reign of Antichrist, the usefulness of which we shall consider in its due place.</p>
                  <p>Nor content with this, I have prefixed <hi>two</hi> other <hi>Queries</hi> that tend to the satisfaction of them that urge against the truth of the doctrine, <hi>That the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses are risen,</hi> that they are made to rise while the last <hi>semitime</hi> is but current, and not expired, as if this destroy'd the usefulness of the Prophecy, by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving so large a latitude of time as the space of 180 years for the fulfilling its prediction, and were also inconsistent with its synchronizing with the 42 months and 1260 days, those days not admitting of any <hi>latitude,</hi> but necessarily signifying <hi>strictly</hi> so
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:48067:193"/>
many <hi>years.</hi> The use therefore of these two first <hi>Queries</hi> for the solving this difficulty, I shall also take notice of in its due place. In the mean time we shall produce into view the <hi>Queries</hi> themselves, of which this is</p>
                  <p>The first,</p>
                  <p>Whether <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Three times and an Half, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever disguized or varied into 42 months and 1260 days, be not the standing Authentick measure of the <hi>Medial-Visions</hi> of the <hi>Apocalypse?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The second,</p>
                  <p>It being granted that <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Three times and an Half is the standing Authentick measure of the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial-Visions,</hi> what may be the genuine use and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of varying them into 42 months and 1260 days?</p>
                  <p>The third,</p>
                  <p>What is the precise <hi>Epocha</hi> of the <hi>Medial-Visions,</hi> or of the <hi>Apostasie</hi> or Kingdom of Antichrist?</p>
                  <p>These be the three Queries. And as to the first I say, That <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Three times and an Half, or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Semitimes, is the standing Authentick measure of the <hi>Medial-Visions</hi> of the Apocalypse. Of which that of the woman in the Wilderness is one, of whom it is said, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 12.14. That she was there to be nourished for a Time, and Times, and half a Time, with which abiding of the woman in the Wilderness,

The Entireness of the Rule of the seven-headed Beast restored, The Outer Court troden under foot by the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> The two Witnesses prophesying in sackcloth, The entire Dominion of the two-horned Beast or false Prophet, or of the great Whore or My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical <hi>Babylon,</hi> according to Mr. <hi>Mede,</hi> and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the truth, do synchronize. Of all these Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons therefore are <hi>Daniel</hi>'s seven Semitimes the stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Authentick measure for the computing the event of any Medial-Vision, however varied into 1260 days and 42 months; nor is there any more precise re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striction as to <hi>eventual</hi> prediction, than there would have been, though the expression of Three times and an Half or seven Semitimes had never been varied in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to 42 months and 1260 days. And my Reasons for this my Assertion are these.</p>
                  <p>First, It looks something absurdly and derogato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to the Omniscience of the Spirit of Prophecy, as if he were farther advanced in Knowledge in St. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Time than in <hi>Daniel</hi>'s, and as if about 600 years nearer approach to the event predicted, enabled him to count the duration of the little Horn with eyes in St. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s time to the <hi>punctuality</hi> of a <hi>year,</hi> when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in <hi>Daniel</hi>'s time he could count it onely according to those large measures of <hi>Semitimes,</hi> each of which contains 180 years. This methinks looks very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couthly and absurdly. Indeed if he had not counted the reign of the little ruffling Horn with eyes by any parts of time, but onely predicted that such a Polity would appear during the fourth Kingdom, and then after in the Apocalypse told accurately the time of its duration, whether 42 months or 1260 days prophetical it would look unsuspectedly, but things being as they are, they plainly look derogatorily to
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:48067:194"/>
that perfection of Prescience in the Spirit of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, to fansie he foretold the time of the Event an <hi>hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred</hi> and <hi>eighty</hi> times more <hi>punctually</hi> at 600 years nearer approach thereto, <hi>viz.</hi> in St. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s time, than he did at that distance in <hi>Daniel</hi>'s time, as if he wanted that advantage then which he had after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is plainly suggested by the Spirit of Prophecy, <hi>chap.</hi> 12. from those two places compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together, <hi>vers.</hi> 6. <hi>And the woman fled into the Wilderness, that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days:</hi> and <hi>vers.</hi> 14. <hi>And to the woman were given two wings of a great Eagle, that she might fly into the Wilderness into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time:</hi> It is plainly, I say, hence suggested, That the expressing of the duration of the <hi>Medial-Visions</hi> by 1260 days is not for any more <hi>accurate</hi> account (from some known <hi>Epocha</hi>) of the time of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted <hi>Event</hi>; For then the time of the woman's a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode in the Wilderness should have been expressed in the first place by those more general and lax mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of, a <hi>Time, and Times, and half a Time,</hi> or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>Semitimes,</hi> but then afterwards by that more strickt and minute measure of a <hi>Day,</hi> as intimating the event to be predicted even to a set Prophetical Day. But it being quite contrary, it is a plain insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation that <hi>Daniel</hi>'s seven <hi>Semitimes</hi> is the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical measure to estimate the <hi>true</hi> time of the <hi>events</hi> by, and not those lesser parts of time a Prophetical <hi>Day</hi> or <hi>Month,</hi> this measure of <hi>Daniel</hi> being placed not onely after the 1260 days in this and the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chapter, but also after the 42 months there men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to be a key to the right understanding of these Variations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="362" facs="tcp:48067:195"/>Thirdly, It is apparent that the variation of the seven Semitimes is not intended for any more <hi>punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi> and <hi>restrictively</hi> predicting the event, for that the variation would then have been onely into 1260 days Prophetical. But it being also into 42 months, it will entangle the account, and make the Prophecy seem to contradict it self, and imply things impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be possible, that is, that the Prophecy shall predict true as to time, and not true at once. For if the Event predicted fall within the last part of time, suppose, the last Prophetick <hi>Month,</hi> though but a little after the beginning thereof the Prophecy is <hi>true,</hi> but the same or what is necessarily and inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately Synchronal to it, not falling out in the last of the 1260 <hi>days,</hi> according to which expression it should do, it makes the prediction <hi>false.</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there is the same reason of the last <hi>Semitime.</hi> In the fifth month whereof, if the woman go out of the Wilderness, the prediction is true; but sith it is not in the last month, nor in the last day, it is dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly false. Whence it is manifest that those variati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the seven <hi>Semitimes</hi> into 42 months and 1260 days are onely Cortical in the external Celature of the Vision, are mere <hi>Numeral Diorisms,</hi> not Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Numbers restraining the <hi>event</hi> to any closer pinch of time than if the duration of the <hi>Medial-Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions</hi> had been in every place expressed by seven Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, In the Vision of the two Witnesses, who while the Outer Court is troden down by the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> for 42 months, do mournfully prophesie 1260 days, which is the same time in other Terms, the Spirit of Prophecy reducing all at last in this Vision, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 11. <hi>vers.</hi> 8.11. to <hi>three days and an half,</hi> does
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:48067:195"/>
himself set his Seal to this truth, That as to the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strictive</hi> prediction of the <hi>event</hi> there was never greater <hi>preciseness</hi> intended, than what that latitude of numbering by <hi>Semitimes</hi> did require, which is very lax. And that by three days and an half, three times and an half, or <hi>Daniel</hi>'s seven Semitimes are signified, that Assertion by invincible demonstration in the <hi>Apology</hi> (I mean by those six solid arguments, which the Remarker as eager and keen as he is upon the business to invalidate them, has but shewn his own weakness in attempting it) is made good to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny intelligent and unprejudiced Reader. Wherefore by the Reduction, in the close of the Vision, of the 42 <hi>months</hi> and 1260 <hi>days</hi> to <hi>Daniel</hi>'s three times and an half (expounding [Day] by Time first, as it does most certainly sometimes so signifie, and therefore from the abovesaid arguments, as certainly so signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies here) we may be assured from the Testimony of the Spirit of Prophecy himself, that the onely stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Authentick measure of the duration of the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial-Visions,</hi> is <hi>Daniel</hi>'s <hi>seven Semitimes.</hi> But there is a necessity of reducing the signification of <hi>Day</hi> to that of <hi>Time</hi> first, because a Prophetick <hi>day</hi> signifies but <hi>one</hi> natural <hi>year,</hi> but a <hi>Time</hi> a <hi>Prophetick year,</hi> which is 360 natural years.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, The nature of the things predicted to come to pass at the expiration of the Time of the <hi>Medial-Visions</hi> is such, that their accomplishment cannot be effected in the space of a single <hi>Prophetical day.</hi> Such is a considerable breaking the entireness of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of the little Horn with eyes, or of the two-horned Beast, the false Prophet or Whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> the fall of the tenth part of the City and Rising of the Witnesses, at which such Acclamations as these
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:48067:196"/>
are heard in Heaven. The Kingdoms of the World are become the Kingdoms of our Lord and his Christ, <hi>chap.</hi> 11. <hi>vers.</hi> 15. And <hi>chap.</hi> 15. that Song of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> and the Lamb is sung by the triumphant Harpers on the Sea of glass, <hi>Great and marvellous are thy works, Lord God Almighty: Iust and true are thy ways, O King of Saints: Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorifie thy Name? For thou onely art holy, for all Nations shall come and worship before thee, for thy judgments are manifest.</hi> Surely all this must not signifie such small Atchievements as can be brought about in one single year. And as <hi>Rome</hi> was not built in one natural day, no more could so great a ruine of the <hi>Roman</hi> Polity or Hierarchy, though but partial, be effected in one <hi>Prophetical day.</hi> Which unless we reckon by <hi>Semitimes,</hi> must of necessity be the measure we reckon by. Wherefore it is plain from the nature of the things predicted, though they were not come to pass, that they are not to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieved in one single year or prophetick day, and that therefore the variation of the seven <hi>Semitimes</hi> into 1260 <hi>days</hi> was never intended, for so <hi>precise</hi> an indication of the <hi>predicted event,</hi> as to limit it to a single year. And the 1260 days and 42 months be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but the variations of the same seven <hi>Semitimes</hi> of <hi>Daniel,</hi> there is the same reason of the <hi>months</hi> also, that neither of them imply a greater strictness than that ancient Authentick standing measure in <hi>Daniel,</hi> A time, and times, and half a time. But as I said, if we stick not to this, the onely measure is by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical <hi>Days.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly and lastly, To all this for our farther assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that <hi>Daniel</hi>'s measure is the onely measure to measure the true time of the Events of the Medial-Visions
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:48067:196"/>
by, we may add, that one real Specimen, which indeed involves in it all the middle Synchro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, namely, The <hi>Rising of the Witnesses.</hi> Which, forasmuch as I have so firmly demonstrated the <hi>effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> of all the <hi>Vials</hi> to <hi>follow,</hi> it is as firmly from thence sure and manifest, that the Reformation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun by <hi>Luther,</hi> and spreading and propagating it self thorough so many Countries, Principalities and Kingdoms, is the completion of that Vision of the Rising of the Witnesses. Which noble Event pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted in this Vision, it is manifest according to Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story, was not restrained to a Prophetick day nor month neither, but fell out simply, as was predicted in the last <hi>Half day,</hi> or last <hi>Semitime</hi> of the seven. But that the Vials follow the sixth Trumpet or Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the Witnesses, and that consequently the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bovesaid Reformation is the completion of that Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Witnesses Rising, I thought it was even with Mathematical evidence made good in the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy</hi>; but I hope now, whoever carefully peruses the foregoing <hi>Answer</hi> to the <hi>Remarks,</hi> made by so keen a <hi>Remarker,</hi> will find that the <hi>Answerer</hi> has had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion given him of so fully and clearly confirming, and invincibly evidencing the forementioned Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that it will not be in the power of any one that closely attends to what is written any longer to hesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate about the truth thereof, nor consequently to doubt of this present Truth, That <hi>Daniel</hi>'s seven Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitimes is the onely real and Authentick standing measure, according to which the Events of the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial-Visions</hi> are to be computed, and their truth exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined from a certain <hi>Epocha.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which first point being cleared, we are in the next place to enquire <hi>what may be the genuine use and
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:48067:197"/>
purpose of varying</hi> Daniel<hi>'s seven Semitimes into</hi> 42 months <hi>and</hi> 1260 days <hi>in these Visions of the</hi> Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lypse. For certainly there is no trifling in so sacred a Writing.</p>
                  <p>For, to begin with what may seem slightest, first, <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Time and Times, and half a Time, being so often to recur in the <hi>Medial-Visions,</hi> if there had been no varying of them into the 42 <hi>months</hi> and 1260 <hi>days</hi>; I may add also into the <hi>three days and an half,</hi> the outside of the Visions would have looked more homely and bald, whenas this variety gives grace and ornament unto them. Nor can this Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son seem trisling, if we consider that God and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in Plants and Animals does not affect onely what is wholsome and usefull, but adds also there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto what is handsome and beautifull.</p>
                  <p>But secondly, It seems very requisite, yea even necessary for the Apocalyptick styles, which describes bodies Politick, which are to continue for many Ages together by the Symbol of some particular Beast, or single humane Person, man or woman, which it would be indecorous to declare, they were to continue a Time, and Times, and half a Time, which either conveys nothing to the mind of the Reader, or else, if plainly expressed, the space of twelve or thirteen hundred years, when no particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Beast, nor any single man or woman can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to live so long; It was, I say, necessary for the Apocalyptick style to turn <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Time, and Times, and half a Time into 1260 days or 42 months, that the <hi>Cortex</hi> of the Visions might keep <hi>decorum</hi> in those Symbols of living Creatures, and they not be said to continue so extremely much longer than is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the Laws of Nature. Upon which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:48067:197"/>
of <hi>Decorum,</hi> or adorning the <hi>Cortex</hi> with the smooth shew of <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the karcases of the slain Witnesses are said to lye but three days and an half unburied, though those <hi>three days</hi> and an <hi>half</hi> are the same with <hi>Daniel</hi>'s <hi>three times</hi> and an <hi>half.</hi> But to have said either here or elsewhere for, <hi>A Time, and Times, and half a Time,</hi> Three years and an half, had been quite out of the road of the Prophetick style, which never names a <hi>year</hi> for a <hi>year of years,</hi> though a <hi>Time</hi> signifies such a <hi>Prophetical</hi> year, as I may so call it, but it is no where in use, and it would imply that no less than 360000 years were the space of the <hi>Millennium,</hi> or Ligation of Satan.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The denoting <hi>Daniel</hi>'s seven <hi>Semitimes,</hi> one while by <hi>Days,</hi> and another while by <hi>Months,</hi> and the applying the numbering by <hi>days,</hi> of which the <hi>Sun</hi> is governour to the children of the Day, the truly <hi>Evangelical</hi> Church, and the numbering by <hi>Months,</hi> which respects the <hi>Moon,</hi> who is the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verness of the Night to the <hi>Apostatized</hi> persecutive Church, is a farther piece of instructive Elegancy, even in the exteriour <hi>Cortex</hi> of the <hi>Medial-Visions,</hi> characterizing thereby the <hi>Gentiles</hi> that tread under foot the Holy City for <hi>forty two months,</hi> and the healed Beast with seven <hi>blasphemous</hi> Heads, to whom it was given to make War with the Saints also 42 <hi>Months,</hi> by the infamous Note of the <hi>children of darkness,</hi> but characterizing the true Church and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apostatized Evangelical Christians, who were to be nourished in the Wilderness [<hi>chap.</hi> 12.6.] 1260 days, and the mournfull Witnesses, <hi>chap.</hi> 11. that were to prophesie in sackcloth 1260 days, and to be raised from the dead, after three days and an half, by the glorious Title of the <hi>children of light.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="368" facs="tcp:48067:198"/>Fourthly, This variation of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s <hi>Semitimes</hi> into 42 <hi>Months</hi> and 1260 <hi>Days</hi> has not this office onely of duly characterizing the two Parties, the <hi>Apostolical</hi> and <hi>Evangelical</hi> Church in commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the one, and detestation of the other; but is farther serviceable to us for the more distinct know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Visions, that we do not confound into <hi>one</hi> such parties as are <hi>two,</hi> and notified to be so by <hi>this</hi> character. And hence it is that Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> is sound solidly and judiciously to have distinguished betwixt that woman <hi>Iohn</hi> saw in the Wilderness up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a scarlet-coloured Beast, <hi>chap.</hi> 17. and that men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned <hi>chap.</hi> 12. <hi>vers.</hi> 6. who is said to be fed in the Wilderness 1260 <hi>days,</hi> where the numbering by <hi>Days</hi> does plainly indicate that woman in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness to be the pure <hi>Evangelical</hi> Church, the mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Witnesses, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Whenas the other woman in the Wilderness, <hi>chap.</hi> 17. is the <hi>apostatized</hi> Church, even the Whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> as she is there called. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this distinguishing the <hi>Mulier Eremicola</hi> from the Whore of <hi>Babylon</hi> by Mr. <hi>Mede,</hi> is a thing not to be overlookt or slighted, nor this use of number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the same time, one while by <hi>days,</hi> another while by <hi>months,</hi> to be contemned, it stearing us off from such mistakes.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, It is well known to them that concern them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in these Speculations, that the artifice of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealment is a thing driven at in the frame and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance of the Apocalyptick Visions, as well as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of Revealment, as is noted in Book 1. Chap. 2. <hi>Synopsis Prophetica,</hi> and the usefulness thereof there intimated. And it is obvious to conceive that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guising of the duration of the <hi>Medial-Visions</hi> under so many variations, of a <hi>Time,</hi> and <hi>Times,</hi> and <hi>half
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:48067:198"/>
a Time,</hi> of 42 <hi>months,</hi> of 1260 <hi>days,</hi> of three <hi>days</hi> and an half must needs contribute something to the obscuring of the Visions, and make them not lye so open and obvious to every eye, but gives a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant exercise to the sagacious and intelligent to find cut the mystery, and to reduce all to the ancient <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick</hi> measure.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, But there is yet a farther usefulness of the varying of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s <hi>Time,</hi> and <hi>Times,</hi> and <hi>half a Time</hi> into 42 <hi>months</hi> or 1260 <hi>days,</hi> and that a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble one. For, forasmuch as neither the <hi>Greek</hi> nor <hi>Hebrew,</hi> though they have the dual number expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses the word [Times] by it, what assurance have we but that Times, in [A Time, and Times, and half a Time] may signifie more Times than two, and so it will not be seven Semitimes but nine, whenas se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is the sacred Number the Apocalypse seems to affect. But that they are seven, and not nine, or more, the varying of them into 1260 days, or 42 months does fully assure us, and that by <hi>A Time,</hi> and <hi>Times,</hi> and <hi>half a Time</hi> is understood, Three prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical <hi>years</hi> and an half, or seven <hi>half years.</hi> Of which,</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, There is this farther notable use. For though I have made it plain in my satisfying the former <hi>Query,</hi> That these variations of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Time and Times, and half a Time into 42 <hi>months</hi> and 1260 <hi>days</hi> was never intended for a more <hi>accurate</hi> compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the predicted <hi>Event</hi> from some certain <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocha</hi> to a <hi>month,</hi> much less to a <hi>day</hi>; yet it being known by those variations that <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Number is <hi>seven Semitimes,</hi> and that those seven Semitimes are <hi>seven Prophetical half years,</hi> or seven <hi>Spatia semestria,</hi> by virtue of these Notices, and by <hi>Iohn</hi>'s measuring
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:48067:199"/>
the Temple of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> chap. 11. that is, the <hi>Inner Court,</hi> and leaving the <hi>Outer Court</hi> to be trod under foot by the <hi>Gentiles</hi> for 42 months; from these In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications of St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> and from the proportion the <hi>Outer Court</hi> bears to the <hi>Inner,</hi> the precise <hi>Epocha</hi> of the Duration of the <hi>Medial-Visions</hi> is certainly to be collected. For as the <hi>Outer</hi> and <hi>Inner</hi> Courts are two steady and unalterable proportional Terms under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood in their <hi>full settled extent</hi> or magnitude, so there can be no scruple but that the third proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Term, <hi>viz.</hi> 42 <hi>months</hi> offered by the Spirit of Prophecy is to be understood as to <hi>this</hi> use in its <hi>full apparent extent</hi> for a steady and determinate Infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the fourth proportional Term for a <hi>timely</hi> discovery of the enterance of the <hi>Apostasie.</hi> For no number given for such or such an use, if that use do not require it, nor there be any thing intimated that way (For the three days and an half respect the Vision of the Witnesses, not the measuring of the Temple and 42 months Conculcation) can abate of its full significancy by any prophetick <hi>Synecdoche</hi> or <hi>Numeral Diorism</hi>; much less can it doe so, when the use it serves to, requires the contrary; as here it does, or else the measuring the Inner Court, and the offering this third proportional Term to infer a fourth, is to little purpose. But taking this <hi>third proportional,</hi> 42 months, in its <hi>proper full extent,</hi> as the <hi>Outer</hi> and <hi>Inner</hi> Court is taken in theirs, which are as 7 to 2, it will necessarily infer 12 <hi>months</hi> in the full extent; which therefore is precisely 360 <hi>prophetick days,</hi> that is, 360 years, for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensurate Time of the Church before the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasie came in. And this I think is no contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble use of the variation of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Times,</hi>
                     <pb n="371" facs="tcp:48067:199"/>
and <hi>half a Time</hi> into 42 <hi>months</hi> or 1260 days. And,</p>
                  <p>Eighthly and lastly, Though the variation of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi>'s ancient and Authentick measure into 42 months and 1260 days be not to predict the entire Event of the <hi>Medial-Visions</hi> to a <hi>precise</hi> Prophetick <hi>month,</hi> much less to a <hi>Prophetick day,</hi> yet these variations of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s seven Semitimes into Months and Days, have no contemptible use, in that they are fitted for the punctual setting down the particular progresses and spreadings of the predicted Event, which one Day, nor one single Prophetick Month could contain. We need instance but in that one example, the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the <hi>Rising of the Witnesses,</hi> which began with <hi>Luther.</hi> The right <hi>Epocha</hi> of the <hi>Medial-Visions</hi> being found, from whence the seven <hi>Semitimes</hi> are to commence, the Event is not to be expected till the <hi>seventh</hi> Semitime be entered into. But then if we would count in a natural and accurate order, we might say, for example, That <hi>Luther</hi> appeared first upon the Stage the fourteenth <hi>day</hi> of the second <hi>month</hi> of the seventh or last <hi>Semitime.</hi> That Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> came to the Crown on the twenty sixth <hi>day</hi> of the third <hi>month</hi> of the last <hi>Semitime,</hi> and so of the rest, as we find in History. For still as any fresh Provinces, States, Principalities or Kingdoms, or any Rulers and Grandees in them which were Pontifician before received the Gospel, or any <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelici</hi> before oppressed were advanced into Autority, the Witnesses slain before do in these revive and ascend into Heaven, and obtain rule and government. For the suffering <hi>Evangelici</hi> and the reigning <hi>Evangelici</hi> are conceived but as one body, though the successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be for many Ages. And this I think is one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:48067:200"/>
use of varying the phrase of a <hi>Time,</hi> and <hi>Times,</hi> and <hi>half a Time</hi> into 42 <hi>months</hi> and 1260 <hi>days,</hi> and takes them in both together.</p>
                  <p>But now, which I also noted in my Letter to a friend; In whatever Month or Day there is an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the <hi>Resurrection</hi> and <hi>Ascension</hi> of the <hi>Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> there their <hi>mournfull Prophesying</hi> ceaseth from that Time in that place. As for example here in <hi>England,</hi> A. D. 1559, which is the 26<hi>th</hi> day of the third month of the last Semitime, the time when Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was advanced to the Crown, and several Evangelical Grandees in Church and State to high Dignities and Employments; Upon this Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and Ascension of the Witnesses, their <hi>mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Prophesying</hi> ceased here; and so it was at other times, and in other places. The close Affinity and Connaturality of the things predicted do plainly evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence this to any one that does not wilfully wink a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Truth.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time I think I have made it abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly plain, that though the varying of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s <hi>Time,</hi> and <hi>Times,</hi> and <hi>half a Time</hi> into 42 <hi>months</hi> and 1260 <hi>days</hi> was not to predict the entire <hi>Event</hi> of the <hi>Medial-Visions</hi> to the <hi>accuracy</hi> of <hi>one</hi> Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick <hi>day,</hi> nor yet <hi>month,</hi> yet the Spirit of Prophecy has not herein <hi>trifled</hi> at all, but that there are several considerable uses of this variation, that no man for the want thereof may obstinately pretend that the other must needs be the use thereof, whenas yet there is no necessity at all of that, <hi>viz.</hi> that the 42 months or 1260 days should signifie the <hi>full extent</hi> of that time, whenas that full sense is so easily aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table by a <hi>Prophetick Synecdoche</hi> or <hi>Numeral Diorism,</hi> there being given also intimations thereto.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="373" facs="tcp:48067:200"/>Having thus therefore dispatched the two first Queries, we proceed to the third and last, the Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of which I shall transcribe out of the abovesaid Letter to a friend. Which Solution is as follows.</p>
                  <p>First, having fixt the <hi>Epocha</hi> of the beginning of the Church, which, I conceive, is to be reckoned from the year in which our Saviour suffered, ascend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into Heaven, and sent down the Holy Ghost to assist his Apostles, which is the most indubitable and unexceptionable <hi>Epocha</hi> that can be pitched upon, and must needs seem the least strained to serve any design; in the next place we are to consider, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Epocha</hi> of the threefold Prophecy of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocalypse, that is to say, The <hi>Prophecy</hi> of the <hi>seven Churches,</hi> the Prophecy of the <hi>Sealed book</hi> and the Prophecy of the <hi>Opened book</hi> is not to be fixt in the self same year that the beginning of the Church is. And that it is so to be fixt, these few Reasons seem to infer.</p>
                  <p>First, They are Prophecies all three of them of a large universal extent, reaching from the time, at least of their reception (which was but a few years after the beginning of the Church, especially in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of the time succeeding) even till the day of Doom. Wherefore in all likelihood they are a Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script of the Divine Decree or Provision of the State of the Church, such as God foresaw it would be in its general successions, from the very beginning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, to the end of the World, that so the three Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies or Visionary Representations of the State of the Church may be complete and unmaimed.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is acknowledged by such Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that otherwise dissent from us, that the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the seven Churches begins from the very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:48067:201"/>
of the Church, why should not then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two Prophecies do so too?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The beginning of the Visions of the <hi>Sealed-book-prophecy</hi> and the <hi>Opened-book-prophecy</hi> are naturally applicable to that <hi>Epocha</hi> of the Church we have pitched upon, <hi>viz.</hi> the year when our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour suffered, ascended, and sent down the Holy Ghost to assist his Apostles. For what more natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and fit application can there be of the Rider of the white Horse with a Bow in his hand, to whom a Crown is given, than to Christ ascended and send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down the Holy Ghost to assist his followers, to conquer the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and subject it to the Sceptre of the Son of God, that that might be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled which was predicted by our Saviour, <hi>Fear not little flock, for it is your father's good pleasure to give you the Kingdom?</hi> And this Rider came from the East, <hi>&amp; Oriens nomen ejus.</hi> See the Interpretation of the first Seal in the <hi>Exposition</hi> of the <hi>Apocalypse.</hi> Wherefore this Vision does that right to our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our as to represent his glorious and miraculous assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence at the very beginning of his Church, in the beginning of the Prophecy of the <hi>Sealed book.</hi> Now for the two Initial Visions of the <hi>Opened book,</hi> that comprized in the eleventh Chapter, which begins with the measuring of the <hi>Inner Court,</hi> it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest at the first sight how applicable that is to the Church, from the year that Christ suffered, till the Apostasie came in, and the more Primitive the more applicable; and therefore here is but <hi>justice</hi> done to that part of the succession of the Church, which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches from the first year of the Church of Christ, to the Reception of these Visions, that it be as well as the rest of the time before the Apostasie, noted as
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:48067:201"/>
                     <hi>Symmetral</hi> in this <hi>Visionary</hi> Representation. And now for the Initial Vision comprized in the twelfth, thirteenth and fourteenth Chapters, the Throes of the Church begun in the Head thereof, Christ on the Cross, of whom it is truly said, <hi>There was never sorrow like his sorrow.</hi> These were the <hi>pangs</hi> so ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begun for the bringing forth in his Church a man-child, that should wear the Imperial Crown at last, the Emperours becoming Christian. And so the fight of <hi>Michael</hi> with the red Dragon, the <hi>Paganick Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Power, the battel was begun in Christ on the Cross, crucified under the <hi>Roman</hi> Power by <hi>Pilate</hi> their Governour. But this strategem of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of our Salvation in suffering thus himself to be crucified, was the spring and source of all his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests and Victories afterwards, as is obvious to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, and therefore it were very unfit and unjust to have this left out of the <hi>Visionary</hi> Representation; which yet it would be, did not the Prophecy of the <hi>Opened book</hi> reach to the very first beginning of the Church, and take in the year of Christ's Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixion.</p>
                  <p>And fourthly and lastly, Whenas it is observable in <hi>Daniel,</hi> chap. 7. in that <hi>Set</hi> of Visions that repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents the four Monarchies by four Beasts, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Babylonian, Persian, Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman,</hi> that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing those Visions are received in the first year of <hi>Belshazzar,</hi> which is according to <hi>Thomas Lydiat,</hi> about 50 years from the beginning of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Monarchy, yet merely that the <hi>Set</hi> of Visions might be complete, the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Monarchy is represented from its very first Rise and Original, though above two thirds of its duration was then past when <hi>Daniel</hi> received those Visions. Wherefore the Spirit of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:48067:202"/>
affecting, as I may so speak, this <hi>completeness</hi> in <hi>Sets</hi> of Visions, though the Representation be of <hi>profane</hi> Kingdoms, and we finding no cause of the Vision reaching into some part of time before its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, saving that Intent that the <hi>Visionary</hi> Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation of such Periods of time should be <hi>complete</hi>; we may hence much more be assured, that these Sets of Visions are so, they so much concerning <hi>his Church,</hi> and for whose completeness there were such <hi>weighty</hi> reasons as were even now alledged, namely, why they should reach into the very first year of the Church when Christ <hi>suffered,</hi> ascended into Heaven, and <hi>sent down the Holy Ghost</hi>; and being the space of that time to the Reception of the Visions (though they were received under <hi>Domitian</hi>) bears nothing that proportion to the space of the <hi>Antemedial</hi> Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or of the first six <hi>Seals,</hi> that 50 years bear to 70, which is above the proportion of two to three, but of the other the proportion is less than of one to six; I say, he must be a Sceptick even to stupidity, that is not hence convinced, that all these three Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies I have spoken of, the Prophecy of the <hi>seven Churches,</hi> the <hi>Sealed-book-prophecy</hi> and the <hi>Opened-book-prophecy,</hi> have the same <hi>Epocha</hi> that the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Church has.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore to proceed, we being so well assured of this point, we are next to consider what year of his Age Christ was crucified in, and according to the above mentioned <hi>Thomas Lydiat,</hi> whom I conceive to be in the truth, Christ was crucified about the thirty third year of his Age, he being betwixt twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty nine and thirty when he was baptized and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered upon his Ministry, and he continuing the
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:48067:202"/>
preaching of the Gospel of the Kingdom for about three years and an half (as the ancient Fathers have delivered) before he was crucified. We take it therefore for granted, that Christ was crucified in the thirty third year of his Age.</p>
                  <p>And now lastly, From the Vision of the measu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the <hi>Inner Court,</hi> and the Profanation of the <hi>Outer</hi> for 42 months, <hi>chap.</hi> 11. we gather the time of the beginning of the <hi>Apostasie</hi> thus. <hi>Villalpandus</hi> divides the large Square-<hi>Area,</hi> upon which the Temple and all the buildings belonging to the <hi>Inner</hi> and <hi>Outer</hi> Court are placed, into nine particular equal Square-<hi>Area's.</hi> Two of these <hi>Area's</hi> are those on which not onely the Temple, but all the <hi>Porticus</hi>'s that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the <hi>Inner</hi> Court are built. With <hi>Area</hi> of the <hi>Inner</hi> Court, distributed into two Squares, has in its <hi>Western</hi> Square the <hi>Temple,</hi> on its <hi>Eastern</hi> the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar</hi> for Holocausts. But thus the <hi>Inner</hi> Court taking up just <hi>two</hi> Squares of the nine <hi>equal</hi> Squares, and the rest being allotted to the <hi>Outer</hi> Court with its buildings or <hi>Porticus</hi>'s, it is plain that the <hi>Area</hi> of the <hi>Outer</hi> Court to the <hi>Inner</hi> is as 7 to 2. And the <hi>two first</hi> of the <hi>proportional</hi> Terms being thus inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riably fixt, the <hi>third proportional</hi> 42 is to be taken in such a fixt invariable sense, without any figure or <hi>Diorism,</hi> as has been proved above. Whence the <hi>fourth proportional</hi> will infallibly be inferred thus; As 7 to 2, so 42 <hi>months</hi> in the full and fixt extent, to 12 <hi>months</hi>; which are equal to 360 <hi>days propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi> which is so many <hi>years.</hi> Therefore the <hi>Symme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral</hi> Time of the Church before the <hi>Apostasie</hi> came in is 360 years. Which 360 years include the year of Christ's Crucifixion. But there were 32 years an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent thereto, which added to 360, makes 392
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:48067:203"/>
years. To this very year <hi>inclusively,</hi> according to this compute, the Church continued <hi>Symmetral.</hi> Wherefore the first year from which the Apostasie is to be computed, is the year 393, seven years di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant from the year of our Lord 400; which for roundness sake is usually made the <hi>Epocha</hi> of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postasie.</hi> And <hi>Chemnitius</hi> expresly says that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of Saints began to be brought into the Church, <hi>Non multo ante annum quadringentesimum.</hi> And I think 393 is not much before the year of our Lord 400. This 393 therefore is the precise <hi>Epocha</hi> for computation, though the <hi>Apostasie</hi> came in by degrees as an Evening Twilight. Where it had been hard for us to pitch an <hi>Epocha</hi> to a precise year, if the Divine Providence had not fixed it for us in that Vision, <hi>chap.</hi> 11. Which yet is pleased in another place, <hi>chap.</hi> 17. to make the <hi>Epocha</hi> more lax. See the <hi>Ioint-Exposition</hi> on the 12<hi>th</hi> verse of that Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in <hi>Synopsis Prophetica,</hi> Book 1. Chap. 14.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore as the Rising of the Witnesses in the last <hi>Semitime</hi> may be distinctly noted according to the number of the <hi>month,</hi> and <hi>day</hi> of the month, in which such particular Risings and Ascendings of the Witnesses happened; so in the first <hi>Semitime</hi> of the seven from the abovesaid <hi>Epocha</hi> of 393, may the more notable advances of the <hi>Apostasie</hi> be noted ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>month</hi> and <hi>day.</hi> But it would be over long to insist on these things. This shall suffice for a Solution of the three proposed <hi>Queries.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now out of what has been said to the two first of them, it is apparent that this measuring of the time of the Witnesses Political Death and mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full prophesying by <hi>Semitimes,</hi> does not onely not
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:48067:203"/>
destroy the usefulness of the Prophecy by giving so large a time for the fulfilling the prediction, but is indeed the most usefull way of measuring, as being the most accommodate to set out the fulfilling of the Prophecy in the Rising of the Witnesses, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of their Rising being not restrainable to the strictness of a single year. Nor is it at all inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent with the <hi>Synchronizing</hi> with the 42 <hi>months</hi> and 1260 <hi>days</hi> upon the pretence that those <hi>days</hi> cannot admit of any latitude, but must signifie <hi>strictly</hi> so many <hi>years.</hi> For these 42 months and 1260 days are simply such, (as to the computing of the <hi>event</hi> of the Prophecy) onely in the <hi>Cortex</hi> of the Vision, it being in that case a <hi>Numeral Diorism,</hi> but by the Indication of the <hi>three days</hi> and an <hi>half</hi> or <hi>seven half days</hi> in the conclusion, (which is the golden <hi>Key</hi> of the Vision) they are 42 <hi>months</hi> and 1260 <hi>days</hi> divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded (as a seven foot Rule by six notable equidistant notches or marks the whole making 84 Inches) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to seven equal parts; though thus to have expressed it in the <hi>Cortex,</hi> had been too bald and bare, and not agreeable to the external smoothness and <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> of these Parabolical Visions; nor adapted to the mysterious <hi>concealment</hi> of these Prophecies, which is one main scope aimed at in their frame and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance. But any wary and understanding Reader will easily conceive touching the <hi>Medial-Visions</hi> (all which <hi>Synchronize</hi> one with another) since that their duration answers to that ancient Authentick measure in <hi>Daniel,</hi> of a <hi>Time, and Times, and half a Time,</hi> Apoc. 12.14. or of seven <hi>Semitimes</hi> (as in the seven foot Rule above mentioned) and that this is glanced at again in the conclusion of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion by the <hi>three days</hi> and an <hi>half</hi> or seven <hi>half
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:48067:204"/>
days</hi>; that this is their real standing measure in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</p>
                  <p>Which <hi>Semitimes</hi> for farther use and curiosity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing divided each of them into <hi>Hexamenons</hi> or six-months-spaces, and after, each <hi>month</hi> into <hi>thirty days,</hi> which makes each Semitime an <hi>Hecatonogdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conthemeron</hi> or the space of 180 days; a considerate and observant Reader, I say, will easily gather from hence, that the single measure of the full space of Time allotted to the <hi>Medial-Visions</hi> is a <hi>Semitime,</hi> an <hi>Hexamenon,</hi> or an <hi>Hecatonogdoconthemeron,</hi> and that nothing else is to be understood by this 1260 days and 42 months, but these seven <hi>Hecatonogdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conthemerons,</hi> and these seven <hi>Hexamenons.</hi> So that the event of the Prophecy is not tyed up to the last <hi>month</hi> of the 42 or last <hi>day</hi> of the 1260, but onely to the last <hi>Hexamenon</hi> or last <hi>Hecatonogdocontheme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi>; And therefore these single measures being the measures of this full extent of Time, that as to the completion of the Prophecy, or the falling out of the predicted Event, if it be but within the <hi>seventh Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitime</hi> begun, but not expired (forasmuch as a <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitime Hexamenon</hi> or <hi>Hecatonogdoconthemeron</hi> is the UNITE in this compute) the fulfilling the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy is sufficiently exact; nor is there any defect therein, no more than when a Prophecy foretells such a thing to fall out the hundredth year hence, (which year is divided into twelve months or 365 days) the completion therefore is deemed defectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for the <hi>event</hi> not falling out at the very <hi>expira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the year in the last <hi>day,</hi> or at least in the last <hi>month</hi> thereof.</p>
                  <p>But this being allow'd, which is so obvious and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily known, we farther add, that as the seven
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:48067:204"/>
                     <hi>Hexamenons,</hi> the seven <hi>Hecatonogdoconthemerons</hi> and seven <hi>Semitimes</hi> exactly Synchronize in their <hi>full</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, so do they also in an <hi>event</hi> that falls <hi>short</hi> of that full extent, and is before the expiration of the seventh <hi>Semitime.</hi> For such an Event is conceived to fall out in such a <hi>month</hi> of the <hi>Hexamenon</hi> of the seventh <hi>Semitime,</hi> and in such a <hi>day</hi> of that <hi>month,</hi> which is the very same day in reality also in the <hi>Hecatonogdoconthemeron</hi> of the seventh <hi>Semitime.</hi> So exactly is <hi>Synchronism</hi> observed in computing the <hi>Event</hi> by <hi>Semitimes,</hi> even to that of the <hi>day</hi> of the <hi>month</hi> of the <hi>Hexamenon,</hi> with the day of the <hi>Heca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonogdoconthemeron,</hi> and with the <hi>eventual point</hi> in the <hi>last Semitime.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And yet the Event, suppose, of the Rising of the Witnesses is not restrained to <hi>one</hi> Day or Month in the <hi>last Semitime,</hi> but spreads into several <hi>Months</hi> and <hi>Days,</hi> the Rising of the Witnesses, and the ceasing of their mournfull Prophesying still all along <hi>Synchro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing</hi> one with the other, according to the partial fulfilling of the Prophecy within a certain compass of the <hi>Hexamenon</hi> or <hi>Hecatonogdoconthemeron</hi> of the last <hi>Semitime.</hi> The thing I hope by this time is clear to any one that will not wilfully wink against the Truth, or by heedlesly confounding the <hi>Cortex</hi> of the Vision with the <hi>Pith</hi> or <hi>Rind</hi> with the <hi>Pulp</hi> cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate to himself needless difficulties. And thus the use of the Solution of the two first Queries is sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly illustrated.</p>
                  <p>And the Usefulness of the Solution of the third may appear from hence, That common <hi>Epocha</hi> of all the three Prophecies, that of the <hi>seven Churches,</hi> as also of the <hi>Sealed book</hi> and of the <hi>Opened book</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so rationally fixed and unexceptionably, and
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:48067:205"/>
consequently the <hi>Epocha</hi> of the <hi>Medial-Visions,</hi> or of the <hi>Apostasie</hi> or Kingdom of Antichrist; according to this solid compute the 1260 days of the Witnesses prophesying in sackcloth, expired in the year 1652, which is 34 years before the expiration set down in those Apocalyptick Papers I mentioned in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. So that all his Enthusiastical hopes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits of the year 1686 vanish. As the Event also I question not but will farther prove, <hi>viz.</hi> That his computation is vain and groundless. And the fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his Prediction is the more plainly and precise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly discoverable in that he is forced to compute by <hi>Days</hi> not <hi>Semitimes.</hi> And therefore to be out but <hi>one</hi> Prophetick day, argues the prediction to be false. And yet he is out above 30 such days already.</p>
                  <p>But what better can be expected of what is built upon such weak grounds as the making the <hi>Epocha</hi> of the <hi>Sealed-book-prophecy</hi> and <hi>Opened-book-prophecy</hi> to be the year of our Lord 66. As if in that year S. <hi>Iohn</hi> received his Visions under the reign of <hi>Nero,</hi> in the Island of <hi>Patmos:</hi> Whenas both the <hi>Epocha</hi> is not to be taken from the time of S. <hi>Iohn</hi> his recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Visions, nor in truth did he then receive them, <hi>viz.</hi> in the year 66, but towards the end of <hi>Domitian</hi>'s reign, and about the year of our Lord 94. This the Current of Antiquity, and Interpreters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in. And even those that could wish the Visions had been received sooner, before the destruction of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> that they might with better plausibility interpret some Visions of the destruction of that City; yet the force of this truth is so great, that they do not onely admit it, but with all earnestness and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence aver it, as <hi>Alcazar</hi> does for example, namely, That the Apocalyptick Visions were received by
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:48067:205"/>
                     <hi>Iohn</hi> toward the latter end of <hi>Domitian</hi>'s <hi>reign.</hi> Reade but <hi>Ribera, Alcazar</hi> and <hi>Cornelius à lapide</hi> upon this point, and thou canst not but be satisfied of the Truth thereof.</p>
                  <p>And yet the above named Enthusiast having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from this false <hi>Epocha</hi> 66, that <hi>Babylon</hi> will be ruined, the Beast and false Prophet taken, and all Antichristianity rooted out of Christendom in the year 1686, does not stick to dance and skip for joy upon this rotten Ground or shaking Quagmire with Doxologies and Hallelujah's in his mouth, as I noted at first. Who can sufficiently admire (whether the fraud or fury of) such Enthusiasm? or be so want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the publick good as, lest this malady should hiddenly spread, not to antidote men against it, that they be not shaken in mind nor troubled, as if any Pretender to the Spirit can make it out from Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, that either the <hi>Witnesses</hi> are not <hi>risen,</hi> or at least, if they be, their <hi>mournfull Prophesying</hi> does not end upon their Rising till the year 1686. But that then a new Scene of things will come on, and the Son of Perdition, that man of sin the Antichrist be blasted at the brightness of Christ's appearing?</p>
                  <p>For assuredly, as has been noted at the <hi>close</hi> of the Solution to the second <hi>Query,</hi> whereever the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses are risen their mournfull prophesying immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ceases there; and therefore whoever upon that account fansies himself or others the mournfull Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, if the matter be sifted to the bottom, they will be found mere murmuring Male-contents, and wretchedly blind and unthankfull to Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, in that they so slight such an unexpressible fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to the Reformation, here in <hi>England</hi> suppose, established by the <hi>risen Witnesses.</hi> And though they
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:48067:206"/>
pretend to a greater Holiness and Righteousness than is consistent therewith, or than ordinary Reformed Christians have or (if they neglect not the advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges offered to them) may have if they will, they do thereby but shew themselves to have exceeding much less, and to be far greater sinners, every sin against the Publick as much transcending a private sin, as the concern of the Publick does a private con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern. Which weighty argument I will leave with the Reader as worthy his more full and leisurely Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations.</p>
                  <p>Onely let me beg this one thing of him before I take leave, that he would not mis-interpret this my care and diligence in supporting so certain a Truth as that of the <hi>Rising of the Witnesses</hi> and the <hi>ending</hi> of their <hi>mournfull Prophesying</hi> where they are risen, that the Prophecy thereof is <hi>already fulfilled</hi> in the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Protestant Reformation, and that all computing now by the 1260 days for any <hi>fresh</hi> accessions to the <hi>Reformed</hi> Churches or <hi>farther ruine</hi> of <hi>Antichrist</hi> is quite out of doors. But that the onely true com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of the approach of his farther fall, and of the farther advancement of the Kingdom of Christ is to be taken from the Christian behaviour of the <hi>Reformed</hi> Churches. By how much more truly holy and humble they become, and instead of their zeal, every one for the <hi>self-chosen</hi> mode of Piety in their <hi>own</hi> way, which is very <hi>smally</hi> or nothing to the purpose of <hi>true Piety</hi> indeed (the heat concerning which ways is the very fire of Hell kindled by the Devil himself, the very Mystery of Iniquity and depth of Satan, whereby he subtilly endeavours to extinguish all sincere zeal for the <hi>Indispensables</hi> of Christianity by inflaming mens spirits in the behalf
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:48067:206"/>
of what makes so <hi>slenderly</hi> to the purpose of that <hi>true</hi> and <hi>undefiled Religion</hi> before God) by how much more, I say, that instead of this <hi>false</hi> and Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical <hi>zeal</hi> (a zeal that onely serves to excuse their consciences from the <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>undoubted</hi> duties of a Christian) they shall grow seriously warm in the behalf of the <hi>known, intelligible</hi> and <hi>indispensable</hi> precepts of <hi>life</hi> given by the Prophets of old, and ratified by Christ and his Apostles, that is to say, by how much more just, temperate and prudent, by how much more meek, self-denying and charitable, by how much more faithfull and friendly they are one to another, by how much more <hi>sincerely</hi> pious towards God, and <hi>heartily loyal,</hi> and <hi>tenderly respect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi> towards his <hi>Vicegerents</hi> here on Earth, and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to those that are put in autority under them, whether in Church or State, so that it become the genuine Character of a <hi>Protestant</hi> or <hi>Reformed</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian to be <hi>inviolably loyal</hi> to his Prince, and <hi>cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully morigerous</hi> to all his lawfull commands, by what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Ministers of his Power they be enjoined; I say, by how much more this face of things shall appear, by <hi>those degrees,</hi> and not by the <hi>numbering</hi> of the 1260 days of the mournfull Prophesying of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses will it best be discerned how near, or how far off the Ruine of Antichrist, or the farther amplifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Kingdom of Christ is.</p>
                  <p>But for people without preparing themselves for so signal a Blessing to sit <hi>counting</hi> upon their <hi>fingers ends,</hi> how many years it is to the expiration of those 1260 Prophetick days, in expectation of some strange change of things, which days yet are expired above 30 years ago, what a freak is this? What a Fanatick dotage, to imagine that <hi>yet to come</hi> which is <hi>already
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:48067:207"/>
past,</hi> and conceit in the mean time that God will, however they behave themselves, bring what they would have, to pass, before the expiration of their miscounted years, not improving what is really al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready past to those laudable advantages Providence intended it? For assuredly Divine Providence never freed us from the <hi>slavery</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>serve our own lusts,</hi> or to serve Him according to our own <hi>self-chosen</hi> ways or <hi>humours,</hi> but to be zealous and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in the <hi>indispensable</hi> points of his service and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and as to indifferent circumstances thereof to be <hi>concluded</hi> by the <hi>appointment</hi> of our <hi>lawfull Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours</hi> set over us by Him.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore in very faithfulness to the <hi>Publick,</hi> and to the <hi>Reformed</hi> Churches, I have used this care and diligence to undeceive them, and to set before them more true measures to calculate the approach of the fall of Antichrist by, and the most speedy method of accelerating it, that is, By laying aside all <hi>humours</hi> and <hi>animosities,</hi> and all <hi>heats</hi> and <hi>scrupulosities</hi> about <hi>smaller</hi> things, and by endeavouring earnestly and sincerely, in mortifying our own carnal minds to find and <hi>feel</hi> the true <hi>rellish</hi> of the plain and <hi>indispensable</hi> Duties of Christianity, whether towards God, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Vicegerents here on Earth, or towards one another, and so by the Renovation of our Souls into the living Image of our Lord Jesus Christ, to become real Members of his body, and faithfull Subjects of his Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>This is the onely true Method of the farther rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Kingdom of Antichrist, and the advancing the Kingdom of Christ. And it must be a people of this <hi>Philadelphian</hi> character, (indigitated by those few Names in <hi>Sardis</hi>) by whom the affairs of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed</hi>
                     <pb n="387" facs="tcp:48067:207"/>
Christendom or the true Kingdom of Christ is likely to prosper. Wherefore as many as have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good will towards <hi>Sion,</hi> let them leave counting of time on their <hi>fingers ends,</hi> and doting on an expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Expiration of the 1260 days, as if it were yet to come, whenas it is already past, and lay their hand on that work above described, in virtue whereof the <hi>desire of all Nations will come indeed</hi> in a more illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious manner than ever, and Christ really will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume with the spirit of his mouth that man of sin, and Son of perdition, and destroy him with the brightness of his appearing, and upon his ruines raise his glorious Millennial Empire on Earth: Whenas the Methods of hot <hi>Enthusiasts,</hi> instead of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected Happiness are more likely to bring an Hell upon Earth, and unspeakable disorder and confusion. Which that it may never be, I have used this faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and open freeness of speech which I have, being assured no good Christian will ever tax me for it. For I seek nothing of my own in this but to serve the true Interest of the Kingdom of Christ, as every good Christian is bound to doe.</p>

                  <head>APPENDICVLA APOCALYPTICA.</head>
                  <p>IT was not many days after I had sent the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Appendage to the Printer, when I was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertized by a friend touching Mr. <hi>Samuel Clark</hi>'s Annotations on the whole New Testament, and how particularly in his Preface to those on the Revelation, Dr. <hi>More</hi> was concerned, and his <hi>Exposition</hi> in some passages perstringed. I had therefore the curiosity to send to <hi>London</hi> for the Book, and having got it, perused the said Preface, and not so onely, but in a cursory manner read over his <hi>Annotations.</hi> In which, where he follows his two safest Guides Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> and the Doctour, to give him his due, he has done well and usefully, but in adjoining that third Party so he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terogeneous to the other two, I leave it to his own consideration whether he has not transgressed the mystical meaning of those Mosaical Precepts, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.19. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 22.10. <hi>Thou shalt not sow thy field with mingled seed, neither shalt thou plow with an Oxe and an Ass together.</hi> But this onely in general touching his <hi>Annotations</hi> on the <hi>Apocalypse.</hi> It is his <hi>Preface</hi> wherein I am concerned in the behalf of the Doctour, whom as I have defended so stoutly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Pretences of the <hi>Remarker,</hi> that those main Usefulnesses of his <hi>Exposition</hi> might not be defeated or eluded; so the like occasion again being given, I shall endeavour to acquit my self with like success
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:48067:210"/>
here; in the mean time not at all grudging the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notatour</hi> the praise of what is really commendable in him, though otherwise I am like enough to be free in discovering wherein he is faulty.</p>
                  <p>And truly I think he is highly to be commended, that he had that due value for the Apocalypse (the most admirable Monument of Divine Providence, and of a Divine or Angelical Wit and Artifice that is extant in the World) as to spend several years in the study of that Book. In which study he seems to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, that his excellent Assistent, as he calls him, Dr. <hi>Seaman.</hi> Whom I meeting with, by chance, in a Book-sellers shop in <hi>London,</hi> a little after Dr. <hi>More</hi>'s Exposition of the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> was published, he oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casionally told me of at least half a dozen Authours (for he was a noted Pryer into Interpreters of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies) that held the Epistles to the seven Churches to be a <hi>Prophecy</hi> as well as the Doctour. But when I asked him if he had met with any that had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to make it out in particulars, he confessed he had met with none. But the <hi>Annotatour, better</hi> ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in this study than his <hi>excellent Assistent,</hi> produces one Mr. <hi>Bernard</hi> of <hi>Batcomb</hi> (whose Works, he says, praise him in the Gates, alluding, I suppose, to a key in the door, he having entitled his Exposition of the Apocalypse, <hi>A Key for the opening St.</hi> John<hi>'s Mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Revelation</hi>) by whom he says, after he was pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed of the opinion of the Epistles to the seven Churches being Prophetical (by no less than twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty good arguments, and an Exposition from top to toe unexceptionably coherent, and accurately fitted to History) by Dr. <hi>More,</hi> he was <hi>much</hi> confirmed therein by his finding <hi>him,</hi> the abovesaid Mr. <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> of <hi>Batcomb,</hi> of the same opinion long before,
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:48067:210"/>
who, he says, takes much the same way that Dr. <hi>More</hi> has since insisted on.</p>
                  <p>But when so accurate a Prophetical Exposition, and twenty firm arguments for so expounding those Epistles, wanted farther confirmation from Mr. <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> of <hi>Batcomb</hi>'s suffrage, I hope it will farther gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the <hi>Annotatour</hi> to hear that <hi>Ludovicus Crocius</hi> and <hi>Balthasar Willius,</hi> two famous Divines, do more accurately than Mr. <hi>Bernard</hi> agree with the Doctour's Exposition; who both writ long before the Doctour, and with whose Writings nor with Mr. <hi>Bernard</hi>'s the Doctour was ever acquainted before the publishing of his own <hi>Exposition</hi>; in which he had no pattern to imitate, nor any help but the Scripture it self, and the knowledge of the Prophetick style and History. Which is no contemptible argument for the assured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Prophetical sense of those Epistles. See the Doctour's Preface to his <hi>Exposition of the Visions of Daniel,</hi> Sect. 39. Wherefore I commend the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notatour</hi>'s caution, that he thinks he cannot be too sure of the truth of an Exposition of so sacred a Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and of so high and vast a concern. And do farthermore well approve of his judicious Method of gathering together all the dispersed Notions of such as he conceived had most seriously and carefully, and with most skill bestow'd their pains on any part of this Divine Volume, amongst which he was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to reckon Mr. <hi>Mede,</hi> Dr. <hi>More</hi> and Mr. <hi>Durham.</hi> For it is a very rash business, and the fruit of a strange overweening confidence and self-conceitedness to think that by the bare strength of ones own solitary Wit, Parts, Learning and an overdaring fancy to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster so mystical a piece as the holy Apocalypse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="394" facs="tcp:48067:211"/>But now having freely commended what is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable in the ingenious and industrious <hi>Annota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour,</hi> I hope he will the more easily bear with it, if I also tell him wherein he fails; and it is chiesly in these two points. First, in that he does not keep himself strictly enough to the proper meaning of the Prophetick style, such as may be justified either by examples of Scripture, or by the ancient <hi>Indian, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian</hi> and <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Onirocriticks, such as <hi>Achmetes</hi> has gathered together (and assuredly not without a special Providence) and such as to which all sorts of Commentatours do appeal, <hi>Grotius</hi> himself not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, and many of which are collected into Dr. <hi>More</hi>'s Alphabet of <hi>Iconisms</hi> in his <hi>Synopsis Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tica.</hi> Secondly, he does not bring a mind freed from prejudice, or a purpose of serving a Party, or is at least abused into Errour by following such as have warpt the genuine meaning of some parts of the Revelation to a compliance with that Faction, of which the Writer was, or intended to serve, as <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> did the <hi>Roman</hi> Faction, and so has perverted the true meaning of the Prophecies of <hi>Daniel</hi> and the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> so wretchedly, as no example can parallell; And it is the misfortune of some, otherwise, pious and learned persons, to have been trepan'd into his errours by over-much estimation of his parts and learning.</p>
                  <p>But these things which I have thus hinted will be the best discerned in answering those passages of the <hi>Annotatour</hi>'s Preface which concern the Doctour; which I will take in order as they lye. First then, Sect. 6. <hi>In the Exposition,</hi> says he, <hi>of the Seals and Trumpets I have followed Mr.</hi> Durham, <hi>wherein he differs from Mr.</hi> Mede <hi>and Dr.</hi> More. <hi>I know indeed,</hi>
                     <pb n="395" facs="tcp:48067:211"/>
saith he, <hi>what Dr.</hi> More <hi>saith, That Mr.</hi> Mede<hi>'s In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of the first six Seals is so solid, that it's impossible, I think, for any unprejudiced Reader not to be assured of the truth of them,</hi> Myst. of Iniq. <hi>p.</hi> 224. Here I am concerned for Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> and the Doctour at once, who, I can assure you, does stedfastly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in the same judgment still, both touching the truth of Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s Exposition of the first six Seals, and that it is in all likelihood prejudice in all those that are not satisfied therewith. Let us now hear what the <hi>Annotatour</hi> alledgeth against this judgment of the Doctour. <hi>But notwithstanding this confident Elogy, both the</hi> Dutch <hi>Annotatours,</hi> saith he, (<hi>who published their</hi> Annotations <hi>five years after Mr.</hi> Mede<hi>'s Comment came forth,</hi> viz. 1637, <hi>and who take notice of his Interpretation in their Notes</hi>) <hi>and also judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Mr.</hi> Durham (<hi>whose solid Exposition of the</hi> Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation <hi>was composed near twenty years after that, yet</hi>) <hi>both these, together with others formerly, make 'em re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late chiefly to Church affairs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Annotatour</hi> here would justifie his deserting Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> by the Example and Autority of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Annotatours and judicious Mr. <hi>Durham,</hi> and others before Mr. <hi>Mede.</hi> But for those before him, if they all went the other way, which cannot be proved, yet their autority is not of much value, Interpreters before him roving so very much, and writing their sudden fancies rather, (they having no <hi>Cynosura</hi> to guide themselves by) than what they had concluded upon more sure grounds, and due and deliberate Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, though by a good Providence, rather than any great care or skill, they have sometimes stumbled upon what is usefull and true. And now for the time since Mr. <hi>Mede,</hi> for my own part I have been
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:48067:212"/>
much amazed to observe how so <hi>truly judicious</hi> a Writer came to be so little taken notice of, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally for his <hi>Apocalyptick</hi> Lucubrations, and the best Solution I could find of this strange <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> was, That solid things soonest sink out of sight when chaff and straws float above on the water. Those things which are writ with close strick't attention of mind, and accuracy of judgment, require such a close strick't attention and accuracy of judgment in the Reader to understand them, and perceive the truth and strength of them, which is a pain to the generality of men, even to many of them that pretend to be learned, the minds of most being lax and desultorious, slight and impenetrative; and therefore what is most over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly easie and superficial, is the most generally rellish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and applauded, when things most true and solid are neglected, because they require better parts and more pains by close attentiveness and comprehensive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of mind to receive them.</p>
                  <p>But for the <hi>Dutch</hi> Annotatours, that they should balk Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s Interpretation of the Seals, he that considers the Texture thereof and how it is compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated with the account he gives of the Vision of the <hi>four Beasts</hi> and <hi>four and twenty Elders</hi> with golden Crowns on their heads (which he makes to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent the <hi>Bishops</hi> of those happy times there prefigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as Dr. <hi>More</hi> the <hi>Monarchs</hi>) need no longer won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that the <hi>Dutch</hi> Divines, that live under a state that is neither <hi>Monarchical</hi> nor <hi>Episcopal,</hi> should not be willing to admit, that the best and most glorious times of the Church that are predicted in the <hi>Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lypse</hi> should be <hi>Episcopal</hi> or <hi>Monarchical.</hi> Which two orders are naturally linked together. But now how necessarily Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s Interpretation of the <hi>Seals</hi> is
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:48067:212"/>
interwoven with that of the Vision of the <hi>four Beasts</hi> and <hi>four and twenty Elders,</hi> is evident in that the Horsemen that appear upon the opening of the four first Seals come out of those four Quarters that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect the four living Creatures, the East the Lion, the West the Oxe, the South the Man, and the North the Eagle, and in that order the four Beasts or living Creatures are reckoned. From those Quarters, I say, and in that order do the Riders of the four Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses come. Which answer to the <hi>Quarters</hi> and <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs</hi> of the Camp of <hi>Israel.</hi> And the fit applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of things here to History by Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> is admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and enravishing, and the Providence of God marvellously illustrated therein, and a Reason obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous occurs why there are onely four Horsemen in the opening of the Seals, <hi>viz.</hi> for that there are no more Beasts to point at the quarters they come from than four in the precedent Vision, which <hi>whole</hi> Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, as I said, alludes to the <hi>Camp of Israel.</hi> But let the Reader peruse the Interpretation of the fourth and sixth Chapters of the Revelation in Mr. <hi>Mede,</hi> or at least in Dr. <hi>More,</hi> and so judge.</p>
                  <p>But now for the autority of judicious Mr. <hi>Durham,</hi> whom the <hi>Annotatour</hi> chuseth to follow rather than Mr. <hi>Mede,</hi> who yet undoubtedly much better de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves that Encomium than the other party. Let Mr. <hi>Durham</hi> be as judicious as the <hi>Annotatour</hi> pleases when he is free, yet who can well assure us that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to a Faction, and his affection for the <hi>Scotch</hi> Presbytery (for even his speech and style bewray him) has not blinded his judgment in this matter? Indeed before Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> had blest the World with his excellent Interpretation of that Vision (<hi>Apoc.</hi> 4.) of the Divine Majesty sitting on his Throne, and of the
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:48067:213"/>
four Beasts and four and twenty Elders sitting on Thrones round about him; and of the opening the first six Seals, <hi>chap.</hi> 6. for Interpreters to have fumbled in these things might be a less sign of want of judgment. But for one now, when he had so fair a copy before him, to interpret (<hi>chap.</hi> 4.4.) the four and twenty Elders not so much as of any <hi>Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers</hi> or <hi>Guides</hi> but of <hi>private</hi> professours, though they are said to sit on <hi>Thrones</hi> to be cloathed in <hi>white soft raiment,</hi> such as either belongs to the Priesthood or to Kings houses, and to have <hi>golden Crowns</hi> on their heads, (which in the Apocalypse often occurs and always signifies <hi>Political Sovereignty</hi> and Dominion, not <hi>Spiritual</hi> or <hi>Moral.</hi>) What is this a sign of but of a clouded judgment, much blinded by a <hi>disgust</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst either <hi>Monarchy</hi> or <hi>Episcopacy?</hi> The proof that he would bring from the Song of the four Beasts and Elders, <hi>chap.</hi> 5.9, 10. makes against him. For whereas they are there said to <hi>reign upon the Earth</hi>; the four Beasts indeed as well as the four and twenty Elders are equally there concerned in that spiritual reign; but if that was the onely reason, either all must have Crowns, or none must have Crowns; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise Crowns here must of necessity denote either Christian <hi>Monarchs</hi> or Christian <hi>Bishops.</hi> It cannot be avoided.</p>
                  <p>But in that it is said, <hi>chap.</hi> 4.9, 10. <hi>And when those Beasts give glory—the four and twenty Elders fall down before him</hi>—; and hence there is gathered, that the four Beasts are the <hi>Ministers</hi> of the Gospel: What a preposterous business is this, to make those that <hi>wear Crowns</hi> to be <hi>private persons,</hi> and those that have <hi>no Crowns</hi> to be <hi>Rulers</hi> and <hi>Governours</hi> in the Church? Besides, that <gap reason="foreign">

in a bad, both according to the Prophetick style sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie a body Politick; And these <hi>four Beasts</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly allude to the <hi>four quarters</hi> of the Camp of <hi>Israel,</hi> as also may the four and twenty Elders to the <hi>twenty four chief Priests,</hi> or heads of the Families, or courses of the Priests and Levites, if <hi>Bishops</hi> be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood thereby. But if as the <hi>Annotatour</hi> and his Guide, Mr. <hi>Durham,</hi> would have it from the Text<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the Divine Worship is begun by the Beasts, that is, by some amongst them, it implies that the four and twenty crowned Elders are the <hi>Monarchs</hi> and <hi>Sovereigns</hi> of Christendom, who are not the leading Ministers or Priests in the Divine Worship<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though devoutly present at the same; the Bishops themselves, in counterdistinction to the Christian Sovereigns, making part of the body of the people, and therefore understood to take their place in that multitude of Subjects that make up the four Beasts: And in the mean time, though these <hi>Monarchs</hi> be no <hi>Bishops,</hi> yet they being next under Christ in all cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and over all persons, as well Ecclesiastical as Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, Supreme Heads and Governours, they may be look't upon as so many <hi>Patriarchs</hi> as well as <hi>Kings,</hi> or <hi>Patres Patriae,</hi> that is to say, Fathers of their Country. This sense of Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> or the <hi>Doctour</hi> is easie and clear, but that of Mr. <hi>Durham,</hi> unless we will make symbols and words signifie any thing or nothing, incredible, nay impossible. Wherefore Mr. <hi>Durham,</hi> though called judicious by the <hi>Anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatour,</hi> has in this matter forfeited his Title and his Autority therewithall. Nor can it be a sufficient ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse, nor indeed any for the <hi>Annotatour</hi> to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s way of expounding the <hi>Seals</hi> from the example of Mr. <hi>Iames Durham.</hi>

                     <pb n="400" facs="tcp:48067:214"/>But to give the <hi>Annotatour</hi> his due, he does not support himself onely by these Autorities, but adds what he thinks is reason, for his interpreting not onely the <hi>first six Seals,</hi> but <hi>first six Trumpets</hi> also included in the seventh Seal, of the affairs of the <hi>Church</hi> rather than of the <hi>Empire.</hi> Because, says he, according to Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s own interpretation, not onely the first Seal, but also the fifth and sixth too, relate to the affairs of the Church, and the <hi>seventh,</hi> saith he, contains both the <hi>Trumpets</hi> and <hi>Vials,</hi> and the <hi>Vials</hi> relate to the affairs of the Church, and therefore three or four of the <hi>Seals</hi> being clearly and confessedly descriptive of Church affairs, why should the others be of a different nature from them? it being the very argument Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> himself uses a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst those that would interpret some of the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets of Heresies, and othersome of warlike Invasions, and so bring things of a different nature under one Name. This is the main of the <hi>Annotatour</hi>'s justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of himself for his deserting Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> in the Interpretation of the <hi>Seals.</hi> And</p>
                  <p>To this I answer, That the true Church of Christ being so mingled with the body of the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, it will be hard to find any thing to fall out on the one, but it will some way or other concern the other; but the distinction of sorting the affairs to the one and to the other, is to be taken from the opposition of the <hi>true Church of Christ</hi> to the <hi>body</hi> of the <hi>Empire</hi> and the <hi>Religion thereof,</hi> as counter-distinct to that of the <hi>true Apostolick Church.</hi> And therefore those Visions that relate to the state of the Empire <hi>so described,</hi> as to a fit <hi>object</hi> of them, must be the Visions appertaining to the state of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; but those that in such a sort relate to the state
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:48067:214"/>
of the Church, must appertain to the Church, that is to say, The <hi>pure Religion</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> or its <hi>body</hi> must be the <hi>Object</hi> in the one, and the <hi>false Religion</hi> of the <hi>Empire</hi> or its <hi>body</hi> must be the <hi>Object</hi> in the other. And this therefore it is I declare in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of Mr. <hi>Mede,</hi> that the Visions of the first six Seals and the first six Trumpets, which are part of the seventh Seal, that is to say, that all the Visions of the <hi>Sealed book,</hi> so far as it has pleased the Spirit of Prophecy to <hi>unseal</hi> them, before he descends to the Visions of the <hi>Opened book,</hi> are rightly said to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect the <hi>state</hi> of the <hi>Empire,</hi> remembring also that Axiome, that <hi>Denominatio est à parte potiori.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wherefore I answer, as to the <hi>first</hi> and <hi>sixth Seal,</hi> that they do most palpably and eminently set out the intended Conquest and final overthrow of the impure <hi>Pagan Religion</hi> of the <hi>Empire,</hi> and the <hi>Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Crown</hi> is given to the Rider of the white Horse, and the success of this <hi>Heros</hi> is against the <hi>Religion</hi> of the <hi>Empire,</hi> and the <hi>sixth Seal</hi> the overthrow <hi>thereof,</hi> to omit the affairs of the <hi>Iews,</hi> and the siege and sacking of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which concerns the body of the Empire, and is referrible to the Rider of the white Horse; Nor was the overthrow of the <hi>Pagan Religion</hi> under the <hi>sixth</hi> Seal without large effusion of the bloud of the <hi>body</hi> of the <hi>Empire.</hi> So that <hi>five</hi> of the <hi>six Seals</hi> plainly respect the <hi>state</hi> of the <hi>Empire</hi> as their <hi>Object.</hi> And if the fifth did not, yet <hi>Denominatio est à parte potiori,</hi> as I said. But un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that Seal, the Christians being part of the <hi>Civil body</hi> of the Empire, and the vast effusion of their bloud there intimated (though it was <hi>Semen Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siae</hi> yet) a weakening of the Empire, and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire threatened therefore, that Seal plainly respects
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:48067:215"/>
the Empire also. In brief, the <hi>fifth Seal</hi> is a most terrible commination of a dreadfull <hi>vengeance</hi> on the <hi>bloudy and Idolatrous Empire.</hi> So plainly is the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire</hi> the <hi>Object</hi> of that Seal.</p>
                  <p>And for the seventh Seal, the <hi>Vials</hi> are no part of it, but belong to the <hi>Opened-book-prophecy</hi> (the <hi>Object</hi> of the <hi>Vials</hi> is the <hi>true Churches gaining ground</hi> upon <hi>Antichrist</hi> till the utter Subversion of his Kingdom) But the <hi>seven Trumpets</hi> belong to it, <hi>viz.</hi> to the <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Seal,</hi> and as they are <hi>Martial</hi> Instruments, so they, every one of the first six of them, betoken In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasions, and war, and spoil, and destruction on the Empire, and Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s application of History there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to is very apposite and fit. So that it is plain that the <hi>Sealed-book-prophecy,</hi> so far as it has pleased the Spirit to unseal it, respects the <hi>Fate</hi> or <hi>State</hi> of the <hi>Empire</hi> in the <hi>six Seals and six Trumpets.</hi> But the <hi>seven Thunders</hi> that succeed in the place of the <hi>seventh Trumpet,</hi> as the <hi>seven Trumpets</hi> did into the place of the <hi>seventh Seal</hi>; what they uttered, <hi>Iohn</hi> is commanded for the present to conceal. So that the <hi>Annotatour</hi>'s reason for his interpreting the <hi>Seals</hi> all of them of the affairs of the <hi>Church</hi> quite vanish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and in so doing he must needs find himself in a wrong box, or others will easily so find him, he not interpreting the Visions according to the genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine meaning of the <hi>Prophetick style,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> does, but according to his own <hi>private fancy.</hi> But that I swell not my <hi>Appendicula</hi> to an undue bulk, I must not enter, much less insist on these things. We haste therefore to what follows.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Sect.</hi> 7. The first thing that occurs, is his allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Doctour's dividing of the <hi>third Period</hi> or
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:48067:215"/>
                     <hi>seventh Trumpet</hi> into <hi>seven Thunders</hi> to be an ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Invention, but withall perstringing it as a Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that has <hi>no ground</hi> in the <hi>Text.</hi> But what we have answered to the <hi>Remarker</hi> in his <hi>Remarks</hi> on the tenth Chapter of the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> will sufficiently demonstrate that this Invention of the Doctour is plainly grounded upon the <hi>Text,</hi> and confirmed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from, and so is not onely ingenious, but also true. To which <hi>Answer</hi> therefore I refer the Reader, and proceed to what occurs next, which is his Assertion that the things prefigured by the <hi>Inner</hi> and <hi>Outer</hi> Court of the Temple do <hi>synchronize.</hi> The absurdity of which conceit I have abundantly demonstrated against the <hi>Remarker</hi> upon <hi>chap.</hi> 11. Whither I might again refer the Reader. But because the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notatour</hi> here in his Preface pretends to prove his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous Assertion, which he follows Mr. <hi>Durham</hi> in, by no less than six arguments I will briefly hint the weakness of every one of them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. His first Argument insinuates, that the <hi>Coherence</hi> betwixt the <hi>first</hi> and <hi>second</hi> verse of <hi>chap.</hi> 11. is no other ways to be understood than by allowing what things are signified by the <hi>Inner</hi> and <hi>Outer</hi> Court, to <hi>synchronize,</hi> V. 1. <hi>Rise and measure the Temple</hi>—V. 2. <hi>But the Court that is without</hi> (or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther according to the Greek) but the <hi>Outer</hi> Court of the Temple <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>cast out,</hi> or pronounce to be rejectaneous. <hi>For it is given to the Gentiles, and the holy City shall they tread under foot</hi>— Of which two verses the most easie and natural coherent sense is this, That <hi>Iohn</hi> is bid by the Angel <hi>to arise and measure,</hi> that is, forthwith to set himself to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring of the <hi>Inner</hi> Court as denoting the <hi>present state</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> which he should find <hi>symmetral</hi>
                     <pb n="404" facs="tcp:48067:216"/>
to the Rule. But as for the <hi>Outer</hi> Court denoting a <hi>state of the Church to come,</hi> that should bear the same proportion of <hi>time</hi> or duration to the <hi>present</hi> state of her, that the <hi>Outer</hi> Court does to the <hi>Inner,</hi> of <hi>Space,</hi> you may save your labour of measuring of that, but onely pronounce it <hi>rejectaneous,</hi> Asym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metral or unanswering to the Rule. For Providence has decreed to permit it to be possessed of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> and they <hi>shall</hi> tread it under foot— They do not yet tread it under foot, but <hi>shall do</hi> after such a proportion of time. Does not this easie sense make the first and second verse admirably coherent, and withall plainly imply, that the different states of the Church prefigured by the <hi>Inner</hi> and <hi>Outer</hi> Court do not synchronize, but succeed one another? Let any indifferent Reader compare the <hi>Annotatour</hi>'s pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed coherence, and this of mine, and then give judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. If when he measures, <hi>all</hi> within the Church are included, then <hi>none</hi> are left out. And on the contrary, if <hi>all</hi> are left out, then <hi>none</hi> are mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured, <hi>viz.</hi> at that time. <hi>Ans.</hi> This measuring and casting out concerns the <hi>visible</hi> state of the Church, no part whereof is left out, during the time of <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metricalness,</hi> but it is <hi>all</hi> supposed to be measured and allowed to be in its degree <hi>Symmetral.</hi> But of the <hi>Asymmetral</hi> times of the Church, <hi>no</hi> part is measured, that is to say, is approved as <hi>Symmetral,</hi> but the <hi>visible</hi> state of the Church declared to be all along faulty and <hi>Asymmetral,</hi> though in different degrees.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. <hi>Outer</hi> relates to <hi>Inner,</hi> and <hi>Inner</hi> to <hi>Outer.</hi> But according to Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s way, when the <hi>Inner</hi> is measured, there is no <hi>Outer</hi> at all; and when the
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:48067:216"/>
                     <hi>Outer</hi> is left out, there is no <hi>Inner</hi> spoken of. <hi>Ans. Prius tempore</hi> relates to <hi>posterius tempore</hi> and <hi>vice versâ</hi>; But when <hi>Prius tempore</hi> is, <hi>Posterius tempore</hi> is not; and when <hi>Posterius tempore</hi> is, <hi>Prius tempore</hi> is not. What a piece of lank Sophistry is this? Things succeeding in time may be represented to our understanding together, and that by things that are coexistent, and so may be compared one with another. See my Answer to the Remarker upon this Text.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. The <hi>subject</hi> here of <hi>measuring</hi> and <hi>leaving out</hi> is different as well as the <hi>Actions</hi> relating there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; But according to Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> there is but one <hi>common</hi> subject for both, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>visible Church. Ans.</hi> But this common subject the visible Church is distinguished into <hi>two different states,</hi> the one <hi>unapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statized,</hi> the other <hi>apostatized,</hi> and therefore not onely admit, but call for a different Action, the one of <hi>measuring</hi> and <hi>approving</hi> as <hi>Symmetral,</hi> the other of <hi>casting out</hi> as adulterate and rejectaneous. For so <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> will signifie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 5. How could it be more clearly expressed to relate to the <hi>same time</hi> than it is? For the coexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent parts of a Prophetick Representation signifie the coexistency of the things they represent, if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing be expresly intimated in the Prophecy to the contrary, as it is in the Vision of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Statue of <hi>several</hi> Metals, and of the <hi>seven Heads</hi> of the Beast exhibited at once, where they are in both places, <hi>interpreted</hi> by an Angel to <hi>succeed</hi> one another. This is the sense of his fifth Argument. <hi>Ans.</hi> It might have been more clearly expressed to relate to the same time if it had run thus: <hi>Measure the Inner Court, because true Iews worship there, but measure
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:48067:217"/>
not the Outer Court, because it is troden under foot by the Gentiles.</hi> This, though it does not necessarily exclude <hi>two successive</hi> conditions of the <hi>visible</hi> Church, yet it had been more favourable to the <hi>Annotatour</hi>'s way than as things are set down in the Vision, where <hi>Iohn</hi> is bid to rise streight and measure the Temple, and those that <hi>do worship</hi> therein, (which implies they were then worshipping when <hi>Iohn</hi> was to measure them) but is bid to <hi>cast out</hi> the <hi>Outer</hi> Court of the Temple, because the Gentiles <hi>shall</hi> tread it under foot. Which plainly insinuates that this will be done after the time of the true Worshippers in the Temple—. But then for the other part of the argument, I answer, 1. That parts of a Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at once are sometimes to be understood of suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession, though there is no express intimation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in the Prophecy it self by an Angel-Interpreter, so as in the case of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Image and the seven Heads of the Beast, <hi>v. g.</hi> As in the seven coexistent Churches of <hi>Asia,</hi> which are yet by reason conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to signifie seven <hi>successive</hi> Intervals of the Church, and the Annotatour cannot deny it. 2. That which I intimated before is a fair assurance that the <hi>right Worshippers</hi> in the <hi>Temple</hi> and the polluting <hi>Gentiles</hi> in the <hi>Outer Court</hi> succeed one another; Not to add here, that this Vision in the eleventh Chapter is the first of the <hi>Opened-book-prophecy,</hi> and therefore must commence with the highest <hi>Epocha</hi> of the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, unless we will make the <hi>Opened-book-prophecy</hi> to be <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Which is so exceeding absurd, that no one whose Intellectuals do not labour under some strange callosity, or who is not hugely benumb'd or blinded with prejudice can endure as tolerable, but must feel or discern the extreme harshness or ugliness
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:48067:217"/>
thereof. But this point I think will occur again in his Preface.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 6. Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> himself doth grant, that when the Representation consists in Motion and Action, things done together in Vision are to be expounded of things to be performed together in signification; but, says the <hi>Annotatour,</hi> the Essence of the Type here consists not in the <hi>frame</hi> of the <hi>Temple</hi> and <hi>Courts,</hi> but in <hi>Motion</hi> and <hi>Action,</hi> viz. <hi>measuring</hi> the Temple and <hi>casting out</hi> the Court, and therefore they are to be expounded of things to be performed together, and so to synchronize. <hi>Ans.</hi> No ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Reader can understand Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s grant to reach any farther in Representations by <hi>Action</hi> and <hi>Motion</hi> than such <hi>Actions</hi> and <hi>Motions</hi> as either require or admit of a <hi>simultaneous</hi> performance, as well as of a <hi>simultaneous</hi> Representation. But here in this case the <hi>Actions</hi> or <hi>Motions</hi> are not <hi>simultaneous,</hi> nor so represented. For <hi>Iohn</hi>'s measuring the <hi>Inner</hi> Court is a Representation <hi>preceding</hi> his <hi>casting out,</hi> or rejec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the <hi>Outer</hi>; And his declaring the <hi>Outer</hi> Court rejectaneous, reaches the whole Court, and that whole time of the state of the Church represented thereby; and <hi>Iohn</hi> must needs have a Representation in his mind of both the Courts, while he <hi>measures</hi> the one, and declares the other <hi>rejectaneous.</hi> And these two Courts, the one <hi>unpolluted,</hi> the other <hi>pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted</hi> with <hi>Gentilism,</hi> representing the <hi>twofold</hi> state of the <hi>visible</hi> Church, the one succeeding the other is rightly enough termed by Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> the <hi>Essence</hi> of the <hi>Type,</hi> and the <hi>Object</hi> of <hi>Iohn</hi>'s examining them. So little is there in this sixth or last, and in all the five foregoing Arguments; And so plain is it, that there is not the least Incongruity or distortedness,
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:48067:218"/>
(which these arguments would fain charge it with) in Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s way; Nor any comparison for clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and strength betwixt those arguments which Dr. <hi>More</hi> produces for the fetching the rise of this Vision, <hi>chap.</hi> 11. from the first <hi>Epocha</hi> of the Church, and these of the <hi>Annotatour</hi> which I have confuted. Let the Reader peruse Dr. <hi>More</hi>'s arguments, <hi>Synops. Proph.</hi> lib. 2. cap. 6. sect. 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. and then freely judge. It is not a <hi>probable</hi> bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness, but to the intelligent and unprejudiced plain <hi>demonstration.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Annotatour</hi>'s last attack is upon Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s Notion of a <hi>twofold Series</hi> or <hi>Systeme</hi> of <hi>Prophecies,</hi> (which he says is his chief argument whence he would infer, that the time of the <hi>Inner</hi> Court pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes that of the <hi>Outer</hi>) viz. the <hi>Systeme</hi> of the <hi>Sealed book,</hi> and that other of the <hi>Opened book,</hi> which lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, says he, he fansies must needs begin <hi>ab ovo</hi> again, and commence from the <hi>Epocha</hi> of the Seals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To which the <hi>Annotatour</hi> answers, (1) That there is no necessity of such a division of the Prophecies into those of the <hi>Sealed book,</hi> and those of the <hi>Opened book,</hi> as he could shew by several arguments. Or, (2) If there were, yet what necessity is there that this latter must needs commence from the same start<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing place with the former? Or yet (3) if there be, then I say this is done, <hi>chap.</hi> 12. where the woman cloathed with the Sun is the Primitive Apostolical Church.</p>
                  <p>But to the first I reply, That there was indeed no necessity at first that constrained the Divine Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to frame the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> thus as it is, (this part I mean we speak of) into this twofold Series of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies, is true. But now it is thus framed as it is,
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:48067:218"/>
it is surely want of Wisedom in us not to discern it to be so. That it is so, I need produce no new ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments here, but refer you to Dr. <hi>More</hi>'s <hi>Synopsis Prophetica,</hi> lib. 2. cap. 6. in the above named Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, 10, 11, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To which you may add what I have answered to the <hi>Remarker</hi> on the 10<hi>th</hi> and 11<hi>th</hi> Chapters. But for the several arguments the <hi>Anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatour</hi> could produce to shew, that there is no neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of conceiving those <hi>two</hi> Series of Prophecies, if they be no better than the six arguments in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cause, he does well to conceal them; but if they be better, why did he not produce them? I am sure Mr. <hi>Durham</hi>'s arguments are very weak and sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical, <hi>p.</hi> 465. and built all upon that passage, <hi>chap.</hi> 11. <hi>vers.</hi> 14, 15. <hi>The second Wo is past, and behold the third Wo cometh quickly; And the seventh Angel sounded</hi> —The former part of which does not conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue the Vision hitherto in this 11<hi>th</hi> Chapter, to the sixth Trumpet; So that all that is hitherto herein said, must belong to the <hi>Sealed-book-prophecy,</hi> because the <hi>exitus</hi> of the second Wo-Trumpet, or <hi>sixth Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet,</hi> is here mentioned, no more than all that follows the sounding of the <hi>seventh Trumpet,</hi> to the end of the Apocalypse, belongs to the <hi>seventh Trumpet,</hi> and so is to appertain to the <hi>Sealed-book-prophecy</hi>; But in these two verses there is a marvellous artfull Intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Coincidence of Time, <hi>viz.</hi> That this Vision (<hi>chap.</hi> 11.) of the Rising of the Witnesses and falling of the great City ends, <hi>as to time,</hi> with the second <hi>Wo-Trumpet.</hi> In virtue of which Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation the Visions of the <hi>Opened book</hi> and <hi>Sealed book</hi> are reduced into clear and usefull <hi>Synchronisms</hi>; and we are assured, that what follows in <hi>chap.</hi> 11.

after the seven Trumpets beginning to sound, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the <hi>sixth Trumpet,</hi> and belongs to the time of the <hi>seventh,</hi> &amp;c. But to infer from the <hi>Time</hi> of the <hi>Exitus</hi> of the <hi>sixth Trumpet</hi> falling in with the <hi>Time</hi> of the Rising of the Witnesses, that this Vision must belong to the <hi>sixth Trumpet,</hi> which appertains to the <hi>Sealed-book-prophecy,</hi> when it is so plainly and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly, from the Text, a Prophecy of the <hi>Opened book</hi> is so weak a reasoning, and so absonous, as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be more. And this weakness and mistake makes both Mr. <hi>Durham</hi> and the <hi>Annotatour</hi> give such an odd and incongruous sense of that passage, chap. 11.11. <hi>Thou must prophesie again</hi>—as if it concerned the <hi>preaching</hi> of the Gospel, taking <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesying</hi> in so large a sense that it may signifie <hi>preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> whenas the word (again) plainly intimates that the <hi>prophesying</hi> must be of the same kind as before, that is, <hi>Predicting</hi> of <hi>things to come.</hi> But how strangely does prejudice blind the understandings of men?</p>
                  <p>To the second I answer, That there being two Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Prophecies acknowledged, the one chiefly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specting the affairs of the Empire, the other of the Church; there is a necessity, unless we will be very absurd, and conceive that the Spirit of Prophecy will not be as punctual at least, in prefiguring from the beginning the affairs of the Church, as those of the Empire (as if he were more curious in things extraneous than in things more nearly concerning himself, and as it were domestick) to acknowledge that some Visions commence as high as the Vision of the Seals. Which is a plain demonstration that the woman in the Throes of child-birth and the fight of <hi>Michael</hi> with the Dragon begins as high as the first
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:48067:219"/>
                     <hi>Epocha</hi> of the Church. See what we have answered the Remarker upon <hi>chap.</hi> 12.</p>
                  <p>And to the third and last I answer, If this be true that the second Vision of the <hi>Opened-book-prophecy, viz.</hi> the woman in the Pangs of childbed began so high as the <hi>Epocha</hi> of the <hi>Seals</hi> or commencement of the <hi>Church,</hi> any one whose perceptive faculty is not grown insensible by callosity or gross Prejudice must needs feel, perceive and abhor such an ugly and harsh piece of preposterousness in placing thus this <hi>head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less</hi> Vision first that falls short of the <hi>Epocha</hi> of the Church by the space of the <hi>first six Seals,</hi> or of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt three and four hundred years: Whenas it is so fitly placed to shew, in Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s way, the Purity and Unapostatizedness of the Primitive Church, and the continuance of that State, as the woman in the pangs of childbearing and the fight of <hi>Michael</hi> with the Dragon to set out the Churches sharp sufferings and conflicts in endeavouring to propagate the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, and subdue the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire to the Sceptre of Christ.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore all things being so easie, natural, smooth and coherent in Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s way, as to these things we here speak of, it would amaze a man, that after things are made so plain and convictive, that either Mr. <hi>Durham</hi> the Guide, or Mr. <hi>Clark</hi> his Follower should have their eyes so held, that they should not see so clear and manifest a truth. I must confess I was very much astonished at it till I considered the power of Prejudice from education or faction, and espousing the cause of a Party. And the <hi>Annota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour</hi> does here in the conclusion ingenuously confess the Malady he labours under. His dear regard to <hi>Presbytery</hi> and disgust against <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> this has
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:48067:220"/>
made him not content with the faithfull conduct of Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> and Dr. <hi>More,</hi> but he must have another <hi>light</hi> to guide him out of the paths and tracts of solid ground, in which they would have safely led him, to be carried into Fenny and Marish places. And pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice has so hoodwinked his judgment, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all his arguments against Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s way in these points are thus unconclusive, as I have demonstrated, yet he most triumphantly concludes; <hi>This then being evinced, That the Temple and Altar measured and the Court unmeasured do synchronize, all those Inferences which Dr.</hi> More <hi>so frequently deduces from his opinion will of themselves fall to the ground, As, Episcopacy simply in it self is not Antichristian, Presbytery is not</hi> jure divino, Pref. to <hi>Myst.</hi> of <hi>Godl.</hi> p. 19. <hi>And elsewhere concerning the Office and Dignity it self (of a Bishop) It cannot sink into my mind, That that Order of the Church which was instituted and in practice in those Ages thereof which were Symmetral, can with any face or conscience be judged Antichristian,</hi> Myst. of Iniquity, p. 472.</p>
                  <p>But why has the Annotatour noted that Inference of the Doctour also, that the Doctrine of the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Christ, and Triunity of the Godhead is in this way confirmed by Divine Autority against the <hi>Socinians,</hi> who admit of no other autority but such, and by tricks and quillets think they can shuffle off other places of Scripture that are produced for those Doctrines? Had he rather that this Inference also should fall to the ground, than that <hi>Presbytery</hi> should not perk up and prevail in the world against <hi>Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy?</hi> But I will rather charitably surmise he did not think of that; And declare, that it is great pity but that a person so active and industrious to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:48067:220"/>
truth to the World, as the <hi>Annotatour</hi> is, should light upon any other Guides but such as are both skilfull and faithfull. And lastly, I will not despair, but that he seeing so plainly all his Pretences of evincing, <hi>That the Temple and Altar measured, and the Court unmeasured, do synchronize,</hi> to be utterly routed and vanish, and the Doctour's Notion of the <hi>Symmetral</hi> Times of the Church <hi>antecedent</hi> to the <hi>Asymmetral,</hi> to stand firm and unshaken, that he will admit or rather embrace the Inferences the Doctour deduces therefrom, That neither <hi>Episcopacy</hi> is Antichristian, nor <hi>Presbytery</hi> jure divino.</p>
