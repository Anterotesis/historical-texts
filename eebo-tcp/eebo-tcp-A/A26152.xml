            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO
The Right Honourable
JOHN Lord CUTTS,
Baron of Gouran, &amp;c.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>AT Your Command I preach'd
this Discourse; but upon so
short a warning, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
less than Your repeated Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
could have excus'd me for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing
it. The Subject of it is Death;
a thing which You, my Lord, have
very familiarly convers'd with, and seen
<pb facs="tcp:103238:3"/>
in all its Shapes; but never, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
found it so truly terrible as in
the Face of my Lady.</p>
            <p>All that were about You were wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,
with how Sensible a Concern
You bore the Loss of Her: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
it was such a Loss, as even all
Your Courage was but little enough to
bear. I pray God, it may turn to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
to Your Lordship another way;
and may furnish You with such Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections,
and inspire You with such
Resolutions, as, if well pursu'd, will
make You amends for any Loss, on this
side Heaven.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship has chosen to express
some part of Your Grief this way, by
giving the World an Opportunity of
grieving with You: which it will
<pb facs="tcp:103238:3"/>
certainly do, wherever my Lady <hi>Cutts</hi>'s
Character is truly known; and I have
endeavour'd to make it known in the
following Pages, with all the Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
that becomes my Profession: a
Quality, which, I must own to Your
Lordship, I would not forfeit upon
any account; no, not tho' I were sure
of doing the greatest Good by it. Some
part of what is there written I
know, and the rest I do in my
Conscience believe to be true, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a very strict and particular En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry.</p>
            <p>If I may be so happy in what I
have said, as to contribute any ways
towards fixing a True Opinion of my
Lady's merit, and spreading the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests
of Vertue and Piety by the means
of it, I have all the Ends I propos'd
<pb facs="tcp:103238:4"/>
to my self in this Discourse; beside the
Honour of publishing to the VVorld that
I am</p>

DISCOURSE
Occasion'd by the DEATH of the
Right Honourable the Lady CUTTS.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>ECCLES. vii. 2.</bibl>
               <q>It is better to go to the House of Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
than to go to the House of Feasting:
for that is the End of all Men; and
the Living will lay it to heart.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE first Step to Happiness is to
correct our false Opinions; and to
learn to esteem every thing accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to that Rate and Value, not
which the World, or our own mistaken Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
may have plac'd upon it, but which in
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:103238:5"/>
it self, and in the accounts of right Reason and
Religion it really bears.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Wise Hebrew</hi> therefore has, in this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter,
lay'd together a Sett of Religious Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxes;
which however they may startle aud
shock us a little upon the first hearing, yet
when closely examin'd, will appear to be
very serious and weighty Truths; and such,
by which the whole course of our Lives ought
to be steer'd and govern'd.</p>
            <p>In the first Verse of this Chapter (the Verse
before the Text) he tells us, that <hi>a Good Name
is better than precious Oyntment, and the day of
ones Death, than the day of ones Birth. A Good
Name is better than precious Oyntment; i. e.</hi> rich
Oyls, and sweet Odors, (in the use of which
those Eastern Countries mightily delighted)
are not half so grateful, or valuable, as a good
Reputation, well founded: This is more truly
fragrant, more diffusive of its influence, more
durable: it gives a man greater comfort and
refreshment, while Living; and preserves him
better, when Dead, than the most precious
Embalmings.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:103238:5"/>
And agen, <hi>The day of ones Death is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than the day of ones Birth; i. e.</hi> the <hi>day
of the Death</hi> of such an one, as has, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
<hi>a Good Name;</hi> of such an one, as has
liv'd well, and dy'd well, is preferable by
far to the <hi>day of his Birth:</hi> for it enters
him upon a State of perfect rest and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility,
of undisturb'd joy and happiness;
whereas the Day of his Birth was only an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let
into a troublesome World, and the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of sorrows.</p>
            <p>And then it follows, very naturally, in the
words of the Text, that <hi>It is better</hi> [also] <hi>to
go to the to House of Mourning, than to go to the
House of Feasting:</hi> as Death to a Good man is
more advantageous than Life, so to a Wise
man the Contemplation of the one is more
desirable than all the Enjoyments of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
He had much rather be present at the
sad Solemnities of a Funeral, than partake of
those Festival Rejoycings, which are usual in
all Nations, but especially among the <hi>Iews,</hi> at
the Birth of a Child.</p>
            <p>Hard Doctrine this, to the Men of Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Pleasure! who have said to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
<hi>Come on, let us enjoy the things that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:103238:6"/>
are present, let us fill our selves with costly
Wine and Oyntments, and let no Flower of the
Spring pass by us: let us crown our selves
with Rosebuds before they be wither'd!</hi> Hard
Doctrine, I say, it is to such men as These;
and which will run the hazard of not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
entertain'd by 'em. The Wise man
therefore has condescended to prove as well
as assert it, and to back the severe Rule
he has lay'd down with very convincing
Reasons: <hi>for that,</hi> says he, <hi>is the End of all
men, and the Living will lay it to heart.</hi> As
if he had said, This Dark and Melancholly
State it will one day certainly come to our
share to try; and what must some time or
other be undergone, ought now and then
to be consider'd beforehand: this is <hi>the End
of all men,</hi> and all men therefore should have
their Eye and their Thoughts upon it. And
then further, We are most of us so immers'd
in the Pleasures, and taken up with the Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
of Life, that we need all methods of
reducing our straggling Thoughts and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,
and of giving our selves a Serious
Frame and Composure of Mind: and of all
Methods, this of repairing to the House of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:103238:6"/>
Mourning is best adapted to that Good
End, and will soonest and most effectually
bring it about: <hi>The Living will lay it to
Heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have largely explain'd the Connexion and
Meaning of the Words, which have been
pitch'd upon to imploy Your Thoughts on
this mournful Occasion. The next thing
should be to excite You to a Complyance
with the Direction there given, by the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Arguments of the Text, and by several
other powerful and moving Considerations:
to prove to you the Folly and Emptiness of
a Life led all in Mirth and Jollity and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure;
the Wisdom and Reasonableness of
shifting the Scene sometimes, and of tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Gloomy side of things towards
us; in a word, of exchanging <hi>the House
of Feasting</hi> for <hi>the House of Mourning,</hi> and of
making a discreet and decent use of those
sad Opportunities of Reflection, which God,
mercifully severe, is pleas'd to put into our
hands.</p>
            <p>But I am prevented in this part of my
Discourse by the Pious Design of this Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
You are already doing that thing
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:103238:7"/>
which I should recommend to You from the
Text, paying the Tribute of Your Tears to
the Memory of One, whose Worth You
knew, and whose Want you feel; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailing
the Loss of Her, under the different
Characters She bore of a Wife, a Daughter, a
Relation, a Mistress, a Friend.</p>
            <p>All therefore I have to do on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
is, to fall in with Your Pious Grief al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
rais'd, and to bear a part in it, by
dwelling together with You a while on the
Character of that Incomparable Lady, whose
Death we lament; by uniting, as well as I
am able, the scattered parts of it, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calling
to Your Thoughts at once the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Excellencies and Perfections of which it
was compos'd: which made her belov'd and
reverenc'd by You while Living, and will
make her Memory ever Dear and Desirable
to You, now She is Dead; and which rais'd
her above the greatest part of her Sex, much
more than any Outward Marks of Rank and
Distinction.</p>
            <p>'Tis now, after her Decease a fit time to
speak of her in those Terms of Respect
which she deserv'd: for in her Life-time she
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:103238:7"/>
would not bear it, and took pains to avoid
it; hiding as many of her Virtues as she
could from Publick Observation, and so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>having
her self in the practice of those She
could not hide, as shew'd She had no mind
to be told of 'em: discountenancing, as far as
lay in her power, that odious and designing
Flattery, which Custome has now made a
kind of Debt from Persons of one Sex to
those of the other, and almost a necessary part
of good Breeding.</p>
            <p>But the Dead may be prais'd with De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
tho' the Living hardly can: especially
Such of the Dead, as have not probably a
greater indifference and unconcern for what
we say to their advantage now they are Dead,
than they had heretofore while they were
Living.</p>
            <p>There is a Publick Homage due to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert,
if we take a proper Season of paying
it; and the Ministers of the Gospel, who
are entrusted with so many Methods of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting
Piety in the World, are entrusted
with this among the rest, the <hi>giving Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
where Honour is due;</hi> and the provoking
the Imitation of Men, by setting before 'em
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:103238:8"/>
shining Patterns of Virtue, as well as the
inculcating good Rules and Precepts of Life:
'tis their immediate and particular Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to Praise God; and it does, no
doubt, in some measure also belong to 'em,
to praise those that are Like him.</p>
            <p>And now how shall I enter upon this
fruitful Argument? What Particular of her
comprehensive Character shall I first choose
to insist on? Let us determine our selves
to begin there where She always began, at
her Devotions. In These She was very
Punctual and Regular: Morning and Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
came not up more constantly in their
Course, than Her stated Hours of Private
Prayer; which She observ'd not formally, as
a Task, but return'd to 'em always with
desire, delight, and eagerness. She would
on no occasion dispense with her self from
paying this Duty; no Business, no Accident
could divert her from it; She esteem'd it her
great Honour and Happiness, to attend upon
God; and she resolved to find Leisure for
That, for whatever else She might want it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:103238:8"/>
How She behav'd her self in these Secret
Transactions between God and her own Soul,
is known to Him alone whom She worship'd:
but if we may guess at her Privacies, by
what we saw of Her in Publick, we may
be sure She was all Humility<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Devotion, and
Fervency; for so She remarkably was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways,
during the time of Divine Service.
Her Behaviour was then the most devout
and solemn, and yet the most decent, and
natural, and unaffected that could be; there
was nothing in it either negligent and loose,
or evtravagant and strain'd: but all was full
of attention and composedness; it was
throughout such as declar'd it self not to
be the work of the Passions, but to flow
from the Understanding, and from a thorough
knowledge of the true Grounds and Principles
of that her Reasonable Service.</p>
            <p>This Knowledge She attain'd by early In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions,
by much Reading, and Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
(to which She appear'd from her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy
to be very particularly addicted) and,
give me leave to add, by a very diligent
and exact attendance on the Lessons of Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
which were utter'd from the Pulpit;
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:103238:9"/>
which no one practis'd better, becaure no
one delighted in, listen'd to, or consider'd
more. For at these Performances She was
all Attention, all Ear; She kept her Heart
fix'd and bent to its holy Work, by keeping
her Eye from Wandring.</p>
            <p>It was her misfortune indeed, that the
Exemplariness of her Behaviour call'd off the
Eyes of several to observe it; but more
Her and Their misfortune, that when they
had seen it, and satisfied their Curiosity,
they did not go on also to imitate it. She
often expressed her dissatisfaction at that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decency
of Carriage which universally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails
in our Churches; and wonder'd that
They should be most careless of their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour
towards God, who are most scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulously
nice in exacting and paying all
the little Decencies that are in use among
Men.</p>
            <p>When the Bread of Life was distributed,
She was sure to be there, a devout and
never failing Communicant; and the strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of her Attention, and the reverence of
her Behaviour, were, if it were possible,
rais'd and improv'd on those occasions: The
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:103238:9"/>
lively Image of a Crucify'd Saviour then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited,
could not but make very moving
impressions on a mind of so much pious
Warmth and Tenderness.</p>
            <p>Books She took pleasure in, and made
good use of; chiefly Books of Divinity,
and Devotion; which She studied and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd
above all others. History too had
very often a share in her reflections; and
sometimes She look'd into pieces of pure
Diversion and Amusement; whenever She
found 'em written in such a way, as to
be Innocent, as well as Entertaining. I need
not tell You, to how narrow a choice She was,
by this means, confin'd.</p>
            <p>But of all Books, the Book of God was
That, in which She was most delighted and
employ'd; and which was never, for any
considerable time, out of her hands. No
doubt She knew and felt the great use and
sweet influence of it in calming her mind,
and regulating her desires, and lifting up
her thoughts towards Heaven; in feeding
and fanning that holy Flame, which the
Love of God had kindled in her Heart, and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:103238:10"/>
which She took care, by this means, to keep
perpetually burning.</p>
            <p>When She met with any thing in her
Reading, there or elsewhere, which would
be of remarkable use to her in the conduct
of her Life and Affairs, She trusted not her
Memory with it; not even that excellent
Memory, which She safely trusted with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing besides: but immediately commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
it to Writing. Many Observations of
this kind She has left, drawn from good
Authors, but chiefly from those Sacred Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges;
and in collecting which, whether her
Judgment or her Piety had the largest share, it
is not easie to say.</p>
            <p>The Passages of Holy Writ which She
took notice of were indeed commonly such
as related either to the Concerns of her Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Estate, or to Matters of Prudence:
but it appears also that She spent some time
in mediating on those places where the
sublimest Points of Christian Doctrine are
contain'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in possessing her self with
a deep sense of the wonderful Love of
God towards us, manifested in the mysteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:103238:10"/>
Work of our Redemption: for She had
something more than what in the Language
of this Loose Age is call'd, <hi>a Lady's Religion.</hi>
She endeavour'd to understand the great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of our holy Faith, as well as to Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
the good Rules of it; and She sensibly
found, that the best way to excite her self to
the practise of the one, was to endeavour to
understand the other.</p>
            <p>And this Book of God She was more
particularly conversant in, on God's day; a
Day ever sacred to Her, and which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
wore always in Her Family a Face of
Devotion suitable to the Dignity of it. It
was truly a day of Rest to all under her
Roof: her Servants were then dismiss'd from
a good part of their attendance upon Her,
that they might be at liberty to attend on
their great Lord and Master, whom both She
and They were equally bound to obey.
There was such a Silence and Solemnity at
that time observ'd by all about her, as
might have become the <hi>House of Mourning;</hi>
and yet so much Ease and Serenity visible
in their Looks (at least in Her Looks there
was) as shew'd, that They who were in
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:103238:11"/>
quick and sensible concern at any thing, which
She thought it did not become either Her to
hear, or others to say.</p>
            <p>True Piety, which in great measure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
in an Humility and Submission of mind
towards God, is attended always with Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility
and Goodness also towards his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
and so it was in this <hi>Excellent
Lady.</hi> Never was there a more deep,
and unfeign'd, and artless Lowliness of
Mind seen in her Rank and Station: as
far as she was placed above the Most of
the World, yet She convers'd as it were
upon the level with All of 'em: and yet
when She stoop'd the lowest towards them,
She took care, even at that time, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the Respect that was due to her from
them. She had so much true Merit, that
She was not afraid of being look'd into,
and therefore durst be familiar: and the
worst effect of that familiarity was, that
She was better known by it, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
more lov'd and valu'd. Not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
No one of her Inferiors ever came un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easie
from her, (as has been said of some
Great ones) but so assur'd were all before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:103238:11"/>
of her sweetness of Temper, and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
reception, that no one ever went un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easie
to her: When She open'd her Lips,
Gracious Words always proceeded from
thence, and <hi>in her Tongue was the Law of
Kindness.</hi> Her Reservedness and Love of
Privacy might possibly be misinterpreted some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
for an Overvalue of her self, by those
who did not know her; but the least de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of Acquaintance made all those Suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions
vanish. For tho' her Perfections both
of Body and Mind were very extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
yet She was the only Person in the
World that seem'd, without any endeavour
to seem, insensible of 'em. She was, 'tis
true, in as much danger of being Vain,
as great Beauty, and a good natural Wit
could make her: but she had such an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ballance
of Discretion, that She was never
in pain to have the one seen, or the other
heard. Indeed This was particular to her,
and a very distinguishing part of her Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,
that She never studied appearances,
nor made any advances towards the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the World; being contented to <hi>be</hi>
whatever was good or Deserving, without
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:103238:12"/>
endeavouring in the least to be <hi>thought</hi> so:
and this, not out of any affected disregard
to Publick Esteem, but meerly from a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty
and Easiness of Nature, which made
her give way to others, who were more
willing to be observ'd. And yet She
had also her Hours of Openness and Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
when her Soul eas'd it self to Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliars
and Friends; and then <hi>out of the
good Treasure of her Heart</hi> what <hi>good things</hi>
did She <hi>bring forth? Her Mouth</hi> was at
such times, in the Comparison of <hi>Solomon,
a Well of Life,</hi> which ever sent forth such
pure and sweet Streams, as pleas'd the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and refresh'd the Hearts of all that
drank at 'em. So that a doubt it is, which
was most to be admir'd in her, what
She did, or what She did not say: It
was wonderful that One, who, when She
pleas'd, could discourse so fitly and so free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
should yet choose to be silent on so
many occasions; it was as wonderful, that
She, who was so often silent, should, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
She spake, charm all that heard her.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:103238:12"/>
We may be sure, that She, who had
such a command over her Tongue, kept
no less strict and watchful a Guard upon
her Passions; those especially of the Rough
and Troublesome kind, with which She
was scarce ever seen to be disquieted. She
knew not what the Disorders of Anger
were, even on occasions that might seem to
justifie, and to require it: as much as She
hated Vice, She chose rather to look it
out of countenance, than to be severe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it; and to win the Bad over to the
side of Vertue by her Example, than by her
Rebukes.</p>
            <p>Her sweet Deportment toward Those who
had the happiness to be with her could be
outdone by nothing but her tenderness in
relation to the Absent; whom She was
sure to think and speak as well of as was
possible: and when their Character was
plainly such, as could have no good Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
put upon it, yet She would shew her
dislike of it no otherwise than by saying
nothing of 'em. Neither her Good-nature,
nor her Religion, her Civility, nor her
Prudence, would suffer her to censure any
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:103238:13"/>
one: She thought, she had enough<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to do at
home, in that way, without look<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ng much
abroad; and therefore turn'd the edge of all
her reflections upon her self. Indeed She spar'd
others as much as if She had been afraid of
'em, and her self as little, as if She had
had many Faults that wanted mending: and
yet, 'twas because She knew no great
harm of her self, that She could scarce be
brought to suspect any in others.</p>
            <p>Her Conversation might, for this reason,
seem to want somewhat of that Salt and
smartness, which the ill-natur'd part of the
World are so fond of; a Want, that She
could easily have supply'd, would her Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
have given her leave: but her setled
opinion was, that the Good Name of any
one was too nice and serious a thing to
be play'd with; and that it was a foolish
kind of mirth, which, in order to divert
some, hurt others. She could never bring
her self to think, that the only thing which
gave Life and Spirit to discourse, was, to
have some-body's Faults the subject of it;
or, that the pleasure of a Visit lay, in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
up the Company to one-another's
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:103238:13"/>
Sport and Malice, by turns. And if These
are the chief marks of Wit and Good-breeding,
it must be confess'd that She had
neither.</p>
            <p>With all this Goodness, Gentleness, and
Meekness of nature, She had at the same
time a degree of Spirit and Firmness, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usual
in her Sex; and was particularly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
to have a wonderful Presence of
mind in any accident of danger: to shew,
that Innocence and Courage are nearly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly'd,
and that even in the softest Tempers,
where the one of these is in perfection, there
will and must be a good degree of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>Shall I say any thing of that innate Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty
of Temper, and spotless Purity of Heart,
which shone throughout her whole Life and
Conversation? a Quality, so strictly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd
of her Sex, and so generally, I hope,
enjoy'd by it, that it may be thought, not
so properly commendable in any of 'em to
have it, as infamous to want it. However,
in the most common and ordinary Graces
there are uncommon Heighths and Degrees;
and it was the particular happiness of this
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:103238:14"/>
               <hi>Wondrous Good Lady Remarkably</hi> to excell
in every Vertue that belong'd to her; even
in those, in which almost every body ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells.</p>
            <p>Shall I say, that from this love of Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
it was, that She banish'd her self from
those Publick Diversions of the Town, which
it was scarce possible to be present at, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
hearing something that wounded chaste
Ears; and for which She thought no a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
could be made to Vertue, by all
the Wit and Humour that might go along
with it? These Good Qualities, she knew,
serv'd only to recommend the Poyson, and
make it palatable, and thought it therefore
a piece of service to other people, (who
might perhaps be influenc'd by Her Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple)
to stand off; tho' She her self were
secur'd from the Infection. This question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
was One reason of her allowing her
self in those dangerous Entertainments so
sparingly; but it was but One of Many:
She had really neither Relish, nor Leisure
for 'em; nor for a thousand other things,
which the World miscalls Pleasures. Not
that She wanted naturally a Taste for any
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:103238:14"/>
thing of this kind, for her Apprehension
was fine, and her Wit very good, and very
ready at Command, whenever ehe pleas'd to
exercise it; but She had turn'd her Thoughts
so much on things of Use and Importance,
that matters of meer Pleasure grew flat
and indifferent to her: She was so taken
up with the care of improving her under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
and bettering her Life, in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
of the Offices necessary to her Rank,
in the Duties of her Closet, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
of her Family, that she found, at the
foot of the account, but little time, and
less mind, to give in to those vain Amuse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>She did not think it (as, I fear, it is too
often thought) the peculiar Happiness and
Privilege of the Great, to have nothing to
do; but took care to fill every Vacant Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute
of her Life with some useful or inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
Employment. Indeed none were Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant:
for the several Hours of the Day had
their peculiar business allotted to them, (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it were Conversation, or Work, Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or Domestick affairs) each of which
came up orderly in its turn; and was, as
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:103238:15"/>
the Wise-man speaks, (to be sure under
Her management it was) <hi>beautiful in its
Season.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this Regularity of Hers was free and
natural, without Formality or Constraint;
it was neither troublesome to Her, nor to
those that were with her: when there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
any accident interven'd, it was left off
with as much ease as it was practis'd: for
amongst all her discretionary Rules, the chief
was, to seem to have none; and to make
matters of Form give way always to Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
and Occasions.</p>
            <p>She wrought with her Own Hands often,
when She could more profitably and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>singly
have employ'd her time, in Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or Books; but She was willing to set
an example to those, who could not; and
She took care therefore, that that example
should be well follow'd by all that were
about her, and whom She had any imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
influence over: for She knew very
well, that the description of a Good Wife
and a Perfect Woman in the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> (a
Description which She much delighted in,
and often read) was chiefly taken up in
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:103238:15"/>
commending that Diligence by which <hi>She
looketh well to the ways of her Houshold, and
eateth not the bread of Idleness:</hi> and She knew
also, that she, whose words these are said to
be, was no less a Woman, than the Mother of
King <hi>Lemuel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Diligence, and Frugality are Sisters: and
She therefore, we may be sure, who was so
well acquainted with the one, was no stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to the other. She was strictly careful
of her expences; and yet knew how to be
Generous and to abound, when the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
requir'd it. But of all ways of good
management, She lik'd That the worst which
shuts our hands to the Poor; to whom
She was ever very Compassionate and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable.
To the other delights, with which
an high Fortune furnish'd her, She was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensible
almost; but on This account She
valu'd it, that it gave her an opportunity of
pursuing the several pleasures of Beneficence,
and of tasting all the sweets of well-doing.
<hi>She deliver'd the Poor that cry'd, and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therless,
and Him that had none to help him:
the blessing of him that was ready to perish
came upon her, and She caused the Widows
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:103238:16"/>
heart to sing.</hi> Very easie sure will this
make her Audit at the great day of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count;
that Charity will doubtless be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
to be a Skreen to her few Infirmities
and Faults, which, when sprinkled by the
Blood of Christ, can <hi>cover a multitude of
Sins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the exercise of this, and of all other
Vertues, She was wonderfully Secret; endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to rise up, as near as She could,
to the Rule of <hi>not letting her right hand
know what her left hand did.</hi> And this Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy
of hers She manag'd so well, that
some of the most remarkable Instances of
her Goodness were not known, till after her
death; no, not by Him, who was partaker
of all her Joys and Sorrows.</p>
            <p>Retirement and Privacy She always lov'd,
and therefore chose it, when, after the Death
of a near Relation (an Excellent Person<note n="†" place="margin">The Old Lady <hi>Picke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</hi>
               </note>
under whose Care She had been bred) She
was at Liberty to have liv'd otherwise. From
that Time to her Marriage, which was more
than Three Years, She hid her self in the
Country; having an early and setled aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to the Noise and Inconveniencies of a
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:103238:16"/>
Town-life; and too little an opinion of her
self, to think, that it was so much the
interest of Vertue and Religion as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
was, to have her known and distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish'd.</p>
            <p>When afterwards She went to Court,
(as it was necessary for Her sometimes to
do) She did it with an Air, which plainly
shew'd, that She went to pay her Duty
there, and not to delight her self in the
Pomp and Glitter of that place. Had She
gone thither soon enough, to see that <hi>Good
and Glorious Queen,</hi> the Ornament of It,
and of her Sex, She had been taken, we
may presume, into her Intimacy, and into
her Bosome; for their Minds were nearly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly'd,
and their Characters, and Manners, and
ways of Life not unlike; allowing for the
difference of Stations.</p>
            <p>I need not, I cannot well say more of
her: and if therefore I have fallen short,
in any parts of her Character, (as I am
sensible I have in many that I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd,
and in more that I have left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touch'd)
I desire those particular Defects
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:103238:17"/>
may be supply'd from this General account
of her; that She very much resembl'd <hi>Her,</hi> who
was the Pattern of all that is Good and Amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in Womankind.</p>
            <p>Whether She had this excellent Pattern
in her Eye, I am not able to say, when,
soon after her Marriage, She declar'd to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Friends her thoughts, that Every Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
especially Women of Quality, ought
to do as much Good as they could in the
World; and that the shortest, and surest
way of doing this was, to endeavour by
all means to be as good a Christian, and as
good a Wife, and as good a Friend as was
possible.</p>
            <p>She endeavour'd, and she effected it; for
She fill'd all Characters that she fell into,
and rose up well nigh to all the Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that She lay under: She was devout,
without Superstition; strict, without Ill-humor;
good-natur'd, without Weakness,
chearful without Levity; regular, without
Affectation. She was to her Husband the
best Wife, the most agreeable Companion,
and most faithful Friend; to her Servants,
the best Mistress; to her Relations, the most
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:103238:17"/>
respectful; to her Inferiors, the most obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging:
and by all, that knew her either
nearly, or at a distance, She was reckon'd
and confess'd to be one of the best of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Solomon</hi> indeed, in the Chapter from whence
my Text is taken, has a very severe Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of the Women of His Time and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try:
<hi>Behold, this have I found,</hi> (saith the
Preacher) <hi>counting One by One, to find out
the account; which yet my Soul seeketh, but
I find not: One Man among a Thousand have
I found, but a Woman among a Thousand have
I not found:</hi> by which he seems to intimate,
as if he had never met with One Good
Woman among all the Daughters of <hi>Israel.</hi>
If that be his meaning, I will be bold to
say, that, had the Virtuous Lady we la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
been in his Court, and of his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,
That Passage I read from him
had not now been part of Holy Writ: for
even Wisdom it self could not but have
born witness to the Goodness of her Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:103238:18"/>
And yet all this Goodness, and all this
Excellence was bounded within the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
of Eighteen Years, and as many Days:
for no longer was She allow'd to live a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
us. She was snatch'd out of the
World as soon almost as She had made her
appearance in it; Like a Jewel of high
price, just shewn a little, and then put up
agen; and We were depriv'd of her by
that time We had learnt to value her. But
Circles may be compleat, tho' small; the
Perfection of life does not consist in the
Length of it: if it did, Our Saviour, to
be sure, would not have dy'd so soon after
Thirty.</p>
            <p>Short as her Life was, She had time e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
in it to adorn the several States of
Virginity and Marriage; and to experience
the Sadness of a kind of Widowhood too:
for such She accounted it, when her Lord
was long absent from her; mourn'd as much,
and refus'd as much to be comforted, till his
Return.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:103238:18"/>
As her Life was short, so her Death was
sudden; She was call'd away in haste, and
without any warning. One day She droop'd,
and the next She dy'd; nor was there ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
hours distance between her being very
easie in this World, and very happy in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
It seems, as if God, who had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd
to take her to himself, and to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
more worthy of her, did it hastily on
purpose, least, if the account of her Illness
had spread far, and lasted long, the Prayers
of so many Good Men and Women as had
surely been engag'd on her behalf, should
have prov'd unsuccessful, their Importunities
unavailable. He may be thought unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
I say, to put such a Discouragement
on the United Devotions of his best Saints
and Servants; and, in order therefore to
prevent their Applications, to have remov'd
her from hence, e're they could be aware
of it.</p>
            <p>However, tho' She was seiz'd thus sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
by Death, yet was She not surpriz'd:
for She was ever in preparation for it; <hi>her
Loins girt,</hi> (as the Scripture speaks) <hi>and
her Lamp ready trimm'd, and burning.</hi> The
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:103238:19"/>
moment almost that She was taken ill, She
was just risen from her Knees, and had
made an end of her Morning Devotions.
And to such an One a sudden Death could
be no misfortune. We pray indeed against
it, because few, very few, are fit for it;
and the Church is to proportion her Forms
to the Generality of Christians: But where
a Good Soul is in perfect Readiness, there
the sooner the sad Stroke is struck, the better;
all Delays in this case are uncomfortable to
the Dying, as well as to those who sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive
'em.</p>
            <p>In truth, She could not be call'd away
more hastily than She was willing to go.
She had been us'd so much to have <hi>her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
in Heaven,</hi> and her Soul had been
so often upon the wing thither, that it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
lest its Earthly Station upon the least
becken from above; and took the very first
opportunity of quitting her Body, without
lingring, or expecting a second summons.
She stay'd no longer, after She was call'd,
than to assure her Lord of her entire re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation
to the Divine Will; and of her
having no manner of uneasiness upon her
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:103238:19"/>
Mind; and to take her Leave of Him, with
all the expressions of tenderness. When
this was over, She had nothing more to do
with her Senses; and therefore sunk imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
under her Illness, and, after a short
unquiet slumber, slept in peace.</p>
            <p>Thus liv'd, and thus dy'd this Excellent
Lady, whose Character I have here repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
in short, as my Time, and the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of such Discourses as these, would suffer
me; and endeavour'd to renew a faint Image
of her several Virtues and Perfections upon
your Minds. I have done it in a confus'd
manner, and without the nice Divisions of
Art; for Grief is not Methodical. It is
enough, if what I have said serve any ways
to make her Resemblance present to your
thoughts, tho' it be not after the best and
liveliest manner: when the Life is gone, a
Picture drawn even by an unskilful hand
has its Use and Value; and those who Lov'd
what it represents, tho' very unequally, will
be touch'd at the Sight of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:103238:20"/>
You all are so, I question not, at what
has been said; touch'd in various Manners,
and in different Degrees, as Your Relation
to her was nearer, or further off; as You
knew more or less of her. But You do not
mourn alone; many <hi>Living</hi> there are, that
do now, and many more there are, who
shall hereafter, when her Character has spread,
<hi>lay it to heart.</hi> The World has had a Loss
as well as You; True Virtue and Piety have
suffer'd in her fall: and All therefore, that
have a Regard for Them, shall bear a part
with You in Your Sorrows.</p>
            <p>The <hi>True Servants of God</hi> shall <hi>lay it to heart;</hi>
who from their Souls desire the encrease of
Religion and Goodness, and know the Power
and Influence of so sweet, so winning, so
perfect a Pattern as was set by Her: who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd
Themselves a mighty Countenance, and
the World strange Advantages, from her
Exemplary Sanctity and Goodness.</p>
            <p>They that <hi>Minister in holy things</hi> will <hi>lay it
to heart;</hi> to whom She repair'd, with so much
constancy and seriousness, to hear the Divine
Oracles explain'd by 'em, and to <hi>enquire the
Law at their mouths.</hi> They consider, what
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:103238:20"/>
an Helper and Furtherer of their pious
Labours they have lost; and how much
more lifeless and ineffectual their Discourses
will now be, than they were heretofore,
when She encourag'd 'em by her presence,
and by her practise; and by the strict at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
She paid to 'em, made way for 'em
into the hearts of Others. Virtue went
out from her in whatever congregation She
appear'd; She secretly rais'd and set an Edge
upon the Devotions of the Place: Every
Day of her Life preach'd up Goodness as
effectually, as the most rational and moving
Sermon.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Enquirers into the Methods, and ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
of the Mysteries of Divine Providence,</hi>
will <hi>lay it to heart.</hi> Why, will they say,
when God has most Work to do in the
world, is one of the best and faithfullest In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
of his Glory call'd out of it? why
is She snatch'd away from us at a Time when
we could least have spar'd her? when Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
and Irreligion run high, and Piety is in
danger of growing out of Fashion, and out
of Countenance? Why, in such a Juncture,
is this <hi>Good Lady</hi> taken? and why are so
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:103238:21"/>
many of her Sex, so unlike her, left? Is it in
Mercy to Her, on in Judgment to Us? Is it
because She was too good to live here, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
We were too wicked to deserve her
company? <hi>Righteous art Thou, O Lord, when
we plead with Thee: yet let Vs talk with Thee
of thy Iudgments!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Her <hi>Domestics</hi> will <hi>lay it to heart,</hi> whom
She shone upon always with a singular
Goodness; who were near Witnesses of
her most retir'd Graces and Virtues; and
had the best opportunities of forming them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
upon her admirable Model: and who
will now (alas!) be destitute of her Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
and Encouragement; of her sweet
Advice, and gentle Reproofs; and will be
left to live upon that Stock of Virtue,
which has been happily laid in by 'em,
that Measure of Goodness which They have
already deriv'd, from attending and observing
Her.</p>
            <p>Finally, the <hi>Poor</hi> will <hi>lay it to heart,</hi> whose
Bowels She refresh'd, and whose Wants She
reliev'd; and was ever their sure Refuge,
and Support, their Kind and Merciful Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Friend.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:103238:21"/>
But above all, her <hi>Relations</hi> will <hi>lay it to
heart;</hi> Those, to whom She was most near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
joyn'd by Blood, or Love; and who had
a more particular Interest in all her Virtues:
They will lay their hands on their Breasts,
<hi>in the Day of Adversity,</hi> and <hi>consider;</hi> how
have we offended, that we are thus grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vously
punish'd? and which of Our Miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages
is it, that this Heavy infliction is Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to reform?</p>
            <p>This is the wisest and best Use that can
be made of such Solemnities as these; not
by the means of 'em to excite our truly
pious and Christian Grief to an immoderate
and unchristian Degree, nor <hi>to sorrow as Men
without hope;</hi> but to take Occasion from
thence to search and enquire into our selves;
to learn the meaning of these Divine Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions;
and, after we have interpreted
'em truly, to resolve to obey 'em.</p>
            <p>The Dead are unquestionably happy, whose
Loss we deplore: Happy will the Living be
also, if they thus wisely, thus effectually <hi>lay
it to heart! It is better</hi> doubtless <hi>to go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the House of Mourning, than into the House
of Feasting;</hi> but upon this condition, that we
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:103238:22"/>
come better out of the one, than out of the
other: that we leave our Vanities and our
Vices behind us; that we lay aside our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
towards this World, and our Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
towards another; that we put on
holy and hearty Resolutions of being even
Now, what we shall wish we had been, Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,
when the Fatal Hour approaches; and
of <hi>living the Life</hi> of this <hi>Righteous</hi> Person,
that we may <hi>dye her Death</hi> too; and be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member'd
and lamented, as She is, by those
who survive us.</p>
            <p>Let us assure our selves, that the best
way of doing honour to her Memory will
be, by making her Character still live in
Our Lives and Actions; that the truest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of our Love and Esteem of Her is,
to endeavour to be Like Her: for Thus, we
shall even add to the Vast Reward She is
entitled to, some further Degrees of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Honour; and shall make the Crown
of Glory she is to wear, bright as it will be,
yet brighter, in the Day of General Retribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Till when, it may be piously sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd,
that the Saints departed are not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the <hi>Fulness of Ioy,</hi> that in the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:103238:22"/>
mean time the Influence of their good Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
and good Deeds spreading far and wide,
That too, when their Accounts are made up,
may be taken into them; and the Fitness
and Proportionableness of their exceeding
great Recompence then bestow'd, be manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Sight of Angels and Men.</p>
            <p>Wherefore <hi>lift up the Hands that hang
down, and the feeble Knees!</hi> Think not so
much and so long on the incomparable Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of the Deceas'd, as to forget the true
Use You are to make of this afflicting Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent;
and to neglect those good Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
under it, which the Wise and Kind In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicter
expects at Your Hands. You have paid
Your sad Respects to Her; be not now want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Your selves: but <hi>Gird up the Loins of
Your Mind,</hi> and be Ye comiorted!</p>
            <p>The Consideration of what She was, which
afflicts You, should much rather chear and
revive You: had She been worse indeed, You
would with more reason have bewail'd her.
But why should You continue to mourn for
One, who is enter'd upon a state of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable
Joy? Why should You be deject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at Her Advancement?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:103238:23"/>
She is gone to the place, where all Tears
are wip'd from her Eyes; where there is no
more Death, nor Sorrow, nor Crying: She
is gone, and her Works have follow'd, and
will follow her, to her Great and Endless
Advantage. God grant, that when We also
follow her, we may do it with as little Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize,
and as much Chearfulness!</p>
            <p>To him, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
be ascrib'd, as is most due, all Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
Adoration, and Thanks, now,
and for ever! <hi>Amen.</hi>
