            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I hope ſome able pen will undertake to give him a ſharp and juſt Anſwer; mean while to thoſe Animad verſions formerly made, I ſhall adde ſome few Obſervations.</p>

                  </gap>,</hi> interpoſing himſelf betwixt a King and His Parliament, being in earneſt debate of the higheſt Rights that ever have come in queſtion twixt King and Parliament: It hath been the modeſty and wiſedome of former times, with a Veyl of Reverence, to reſerve from vulgar inſolence the Rights of Supreme Majeſty. And although at this time, by unhappy occaſions, they are fallen into queſtion betwixt a King and His Parliament, yet ſhould not any private man preſume to meddle. What? Are not the Parties a King and His Parliament, exempt from our Obſervators Juriſdiction? No? nor is the Matter above his Cognizance? No ſurely, both are ſubject to his Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall; and therefore he obſerves, and boldly cenſures His Majeſties late An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers and Expreſſes.</p>
            <p>His Pamphlet treating matter of ſo high concernment. I was ſomewhat ſcrupled whether I might lawfully deal with it: But I conſidered, and be pleaſed likewiſe to conſider, That I make not the Meſſages and Anſwers, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the King, or Houſes, ſubject to my Conſure or Obſervation, I onely encounter with the Obſervator: Nor do I deal with the Matter it ſelf other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then I finde it in his Obſervations, examining his Principles, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing ſome Arguments, as againſt him onely; upon all which, I preſume not to make any determinate Concluſion.</p>
            <p>But now although his undertaking were bold, yet perhaps his expreſſions are ſo full of humility, and dutifull regard towards his King and Soveraigne, as will make amends; for which purpoſe, be pleaſed to obſerve theſe Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars [Pag. 37.] <hi>As for thoſe abſurd, unreaſonable, incredible ſuppoſicions, &amp;c,</hi> He ſpeaks of the Kings ſuppoſitions. [Pag. 39.] He firſt ſets down the Kings Reaſons againſt Parliamentary Election of the great Officers: 1. That it would be prejudiciall to the people; 2. Diſhonourable to Himſelf: upon which the Obſervator thus replies; <hi>Man is by nature of reſtleſſe ambition;</hi> Antoninus Pius <hi>was greatly renowned for communicating weighty Affairs, and following publike advice: What will</hi> Nero <hi>more d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

He tells us the King may not think to juſtifie His Acts by a Preſident of Queen <hi>Eliz. For the gracious Acts of ſoft Princes may more eaſily invade the Subjects Liberty, then the furious proceedings of ſuch as</hi> Caligula <hi>was.</hi> Pag. 10. <hi>'Tis a wonderfull thing that the Kings Papers</hi> (ſo he is pleaſed every where to term His Majeſties Anſwers) <hi>being fraughted ſcarce with any thing elſe but ſuch Doctrines of Diviſion, tending all to the ſubverſion of our ancient Fundamentall Constitutions, ſhould finde ſuch applauſe in the world.</hi> See Pag. 3. how he checks at the King for uſing the word (<hi>Grace.</hi>) Pag. 31. he charges
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:125474:3"/>
the King to have left the Parliament out of good opinion to Papiſts and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendiaries; and that His ſolemn Oathes of cordiall love to them, hath wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted integrity and faith. See Pag. 38. how he ſcornfully taunts the King: If he ſpare not the King, do you think he will ſpare the Court? Pag. 42. <hi>He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards not thoſe fond things</hi> (Courtiers) <hi>which cannot ſee in humane nature what is depraved in it, and what not;</hi> But what if he be bold with the ſecondary derived Majeſty of the King, yet he will be more reſpectfull of that he calls the <hi>underived</hi> Majeſty of the people. Pag. 11. <hi>We have ever found enmity and antipathy betwixt the Court and Countrey, but never any till now, betwixt the Repreſentatives, and the Body of the Kingdom repreſented; and were we not now thoſe dregs of humane Race, &amp;c.</hi> What? the Kingdom repreſented to whom you ſay ſo great a Majeſty is due, in whom Majeſty is <hi>underived,</hi> will you ſay they are the dregs of humane Race? Will you charge them with deſerting their Repreſentatives, then which, you ſay (Pag. 16.) there is nothing, next to renouncing God, more perſidious. I fear our Obſervator is ſome one of the malignant party, in ſaying, There is now enmity and antipathy betwixt the Repreſentatives, and the Body of the Kingdom repreſented; he would then have us believe they are only Apprentices, and ſome of the courſer ſort, who unjuſtly aſſuming the name of whole Counties, being hired with pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Moneyes, brought up thoſe Petitions, extolling and approving their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, when as the Body of the Kingdom repreſented, had (as he ſaith) forſaken their Repreſentatives.</p>
            <p>Who ſees not the Obſervator's modeſty? I will give you but a taſte of his ſincerity in citing the Kings words. (Pag. 7.) he cites theſe in a ſmall Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, as if they were the Kings formall words: <hi>When Parliaments are aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, they have no Commiſſion to counſell, but in ſuch points as the King pleaſes to propoſe: And if they make any tranſition into other matters, they are laable to impriſonment, at the Kings pleaſure; witneſſe</hi> Wentworth's <hi>Caſe.</hi> The King onely cites the Writ (the Form whereof is ancient) whereby they are ſummoned to counſell the King <hi>de quibuſdam arduis,</hi> not in all things, but in ſome things, ſaith the King; Is this to ſay, only in ſuch points as the King ſhall pleaſe to propoſe? Did not His Majeſty in expreſſe words at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this Parliament, leave them to their own method? Again, Doth the King ſay, If they make any tranſition, they are liable to impriſonment at His pleaſure? Not His pleaſure, but the Law is the Rule he tyes Himſelf unto; theſe then are but falſe Calumnies. Pag. 8. 9. 46. he charges the King with this Poſition, <hi>The Lords and Commons in Parliament, are meerly to councell the King,</hi> As if without their conſent the King might make a Law. <hi>That they are limitted by the Writ,</hi> ad conſilium <hi>onely, That if we make the Lords and Commons to be more then Counſellors, we make them commanders and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trollers, and this is not ſuitable to royalty.</hi> From hence the Obſervator takes occaſion to argue very ſadly, That the Lords and Commons are ſummoned

Parliament. The Parliament then, thus conſidered, is a whole compared with ſome part, and the King but a part (though the moſt excellent part) of the whole; Now every whole is greater then any part; the Head (though more excellent then all the other Members, yet) not more excellent then the whole Man: whereof the Head is but a part.</p>
            <p>But the King ſolely compared with the Parliament (or rather the Houſes of Parliament) excluding or not involving the King, is ſuperiour and above them, whether you conſider them <hi>ſcorſim,</hi> or <hi>conjunctim;</hi> for taken <hi>conjunctim,</hi> they make but a Body, which though it be greater then, then the Head in Bulk, yet doth the Head excell in Vertue, Excellence, and Authority; And although, by vertue of repreſentation, they are the Body of the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, yet is the King the Head of that Body, and the Repreſentative of God himſelf, who, I am ſure, is above the Body they repreſent.</p>

            <p>The Repreſentatives of the Kingdom either are Subjects, or not; That they are not Subjects, by reaſon that they are aſſembled, is abſurd, and ſo would not the Kings Protection due unto Subjects, belong unto them.

H. 7. 6. A ſtatute that the King by no <hi>non obſtante</hi> ſhall dispence with it, is void, becauſe it would take a neceſſary part of Governement out of the King: If then no act of Parliament be of force to take away the government or any neceſſary part thereof from the King; then ſurely is not any Ordinance of the Lord and Commons of force to doe it; And conſequently the Lords and Commons as repreſenting the vniverſall Realme cannot be above the King, but inferior to him.</p>
            <p>Before the King commanded them to aſſemble, each particular and all of them were his Subjects and inferior to him: If by aſſembling into one body, and the vertue of repreſentation they ceaſe to be his Subjects and inferiors, why doe they then in all their petitions, and declarations or Anſwers (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from them not as particular men, but as houſes of Parliament united) ſtile him, <hi>Their gracious Soveraigne</hi> and themſelves, <hi>His Majeſties moſt humble Subjects, the Lords and Commons in Parliament.</hi> Let our Obſervator judge whether theſe repreſentatives have not ill diſcharged their duty to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome by debaſing thus the <hi>underived Majeſtie</hi> (ſo he calls it) <hi>of the people;</hi> by petitioning in ſo low and humble a forme, him that is but their creature, and in whom there is no Majeſtie, but what is from them derived downe unto him (for ſo the Obſeruator conceives it.)</p>
            <p>But now to anſwer the Obſervators Argument, which is thus, There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, ſaith he, more known or aſſented to then this, that although the King be <hi>ſingulis major,</hi> yet <hi>univerſis minor,</hi> being below the people then in <hi>univerſali,</hi> he muſt likewiſe be below the repreſentatives of that univerſalitie. I will not ſtand to queſtion what neceſſary connexion theſe propoſitions have, <hi>The people are above the King: therefore their repreſentatives are ſo:</hi> The King of <hi>England</hi> is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> doth the Engliſh Embaſſadour, therefore take place of the King of <hi>Spain?</hi> But admitting a neceſſary Connexion. <hi>The people are above the King, ergo, the houſes repreſenting them.</hi> Why then <hi>è converſo, The houſes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting are not above the King, ergo, the people repreſented are not,</hi> and ſo having proved the houſes below the King I have already proved the King above the people: yet a word more.</p>
            <p>'Tis true (as the Obſervator ſaith) nothing is more known, or aſſented to then this, that the King ſolely is <hi>Minor univerſis,</hi> the univerſalitie including the King; For no part, be it the head, can exceed or be greater then the whole;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:125474:6"/>
But againe if the King and univerſalitie bee contradiſtinguiſhed, nothing is more known or aſſented to then this, <hi>That the King</hi> (I ſpeake of the King of <hi>England,</hi> a Soveraign King, not a Duke of <hi>Venice</hi>) is not onely <hi>ſingulis major,</hi> but <hi>major univerſis.</hi> Nay moſt properly is the King above the people, conſidered as an entire Congregation; For chiefly as he is King, he is above all others; Now King relates to kingdome, <hi>Rex</hi> to <hi>Regnum:</hi> and Kingdome or <hi>Regnum</hi> denotes an univerſalitie or body collected. As he is head, ſo is he in place, power and dignitie above the body politique or univerſalitie, and not otherwiſe the head of any particular, but as he is a part of that univerſalitie. As out of the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brion</hi> (ſaith <hi>Forteſcue</hi>) ariſeth a body naturall ruled by one head, even ſo of a multitude of people ariſeth a kingdome which is a body myſticall governed by one man, as by its head: As then in the naturall body the head is improperly ſaid to be the head of the arme, or of the leg, but the head of the body, ſo in truth muſt the King be made the head of the miſticall body, not of the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar members. The King is but one head, and therefore but of one body, not then of the particulars which are many bodyes but of the univerſall one body.</p>

               <hi>Quicquid efficit tale, eſt magis tale:</hi> but ſurely it is mightily miſapplyed by the <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servator,</hi> who would have us imagine, if the people made a King, they are them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves more King then he; I ſhould rather think if Regall power were originally conveyed from the people, they by conveying it over, have deveſted themſelves of it; If it were conveyed with conditions, then under thoſe conditions may it be held againſt them: if abſolutely, then may it be held abſolutely over them; It was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary by the Law of nature, that they ſhould convey over a power unto ſome, for will they, nill they, a people cannot be without a Government: Or were their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance voluntary, have they therefore a power over it, at pleaſure to revoke it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it were often ratified by Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy? Doth not this doctrine deſtroy not one y Monarchy, but all Government whatſoever? The people you ſay are the Authors, and efficient cauſe of that power, that the Parliament Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers have by Conveyance from them; may the people therefore conclude themſelves to be above the Parliament, and at pleaſure revoke and controll their power? May <hi>Newcastle,</hi> or any other particular Borough, or County diſauthorize thoſe they have impowred?

            <p>Moſt certain it is (whether the people were the authors of Regall power, or not) there neither is, nor can be any power remayning in the people, above that which is in a Monarch or King: for if the ſupream power remayn in the people, it muſt be a popular State, ſuch as <hi>Rome</hi> ſometimes was; The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> had a King in name but their Eſtate was truly a popular Eſtate the ſupream power being in thoſe 5 wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Members called the <hi>Ephori,</hi> who figuring &amp; patronizing the people had power to controll the doings of their King; and their cuſtome was (as <hi>Plutarch</hi> relates) every ninth yeere upon ſome cleer night to gaze upon the Firmament, and if they obſerved the Moon to twincle, or any Star to ſparkle or ſhoot, they thereupon would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit their King to priſon, who might not thence be delivered, untill the Oracle of <hi>Apollo,</hi> had ſo declared.

            <p>The Parliament is a Body conſiſting of three diſtinct Eſtates, the King, the Lords, and the Commons: Unto the Commons conſidered alone, it moſt properly appertaines to preſent the grievances of the people, and in humble manner to pray ſuch redreſſe, as the King with their conſent, and advice of the Lords, ſhall deeme to be juſt and fit. And this power (or rather truſt) they derive from the people their Electors, yet not without dependance on the King: The Knights are ſent by the County, but the County had power and command by the Kings Writ to ſend them: And as for the Burgeſſes, their truſt or power (call it what you will) doth more eſpecially referre unto the King, as the author thereof; for whence had the elected Burgeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes their power, but from the Borough that ſent them; whence had the Borough power to ſend, but from the King, who by his Letters Patents
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:125474:10"/>
incorporated them into a Borough, and gave them power to ſend Burgeſſes to the Parliament; which otherwiſe they had no more right to doe, then any other vile whatſoever. And this is the ground of that power which the houſe of Commons have, as concerning the generalty of the Kingdome: And beſides this the houſe of Commons, although a great and honourable Aſſembly, yet of themſelves (as I think) they are no Court either of Record, or of ordi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I ſpeak not this with a minde to derogate from the due ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of that Aſſembly, but to occaſion ſome friendly brother (if I am in errour) to inſtr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

In briefe, may I be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed with ſome grounds, by which theſe and many other their actions and Votes may be warranted; I ſhall thenceforth acknowledge them (whom now perhaps by miſtake I think to be no Court at all) to be the moſt ſupreme Iudicatory both for Law and State: In the meane while I am ignorant of any truſt they have, other then a truſt from the people, to conſult and aſſent to the King and Lords in the making of Lawes, which without the conſent of the Lords, and his Majeſties concurrence, is altogether uſeleſſe, and of no vertue; And in them apart I know no Iuriſdiction, but with reſpect to their owne Members: and ſurely that (ſuch as it is) they have from the Crowne the fountaine of all Iuſtice, and the ſpring head of all Iuriſdiction.</p>
            <p>The houſe of Peeres conſidered ſimply have power by aſſent, or diſaſſent, to enable or diſable the making or repealing of any Lawes and generall Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances; but without the concurrence of King and Commons, this of it ſelf is of no uſe: They are likewiſe an high Court of Iudicatory in reſpect of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular cauſes orderly brought before them, having Iuriſdiction in many, though not in all, Caſes. In criminall cauſes concerning life, and member, I think they have not Iuriſdiction without the Kings ſpeciall Commiſſion; and therefore they cannot attaint any man for treaſon, murder, or felony:

The Lords and Commons preſſed the <hi>King</hi> to paſſe a Law derogatorie to his juſt prerogative, that Parliament being ended, and the kingdome repreſenting it ſelfe againe the ſame yeare, it was enacted, <hi>Whereas in the laſt Parliament certaine Articles expreſſely contrary to the Lawes of</hi> England <hi>and the Prerogatives and Royall rights, were pretended to be granted by manner of a Statute, the King conſidering how that by the bond of his Oath, he was bound to the defence of ſuch Lawes and Prerogatives, becauſe the King never freely conſented to the ſaid pretended Statute; It ſeemed good to the Earles Barons, and other wiſe men, that ſithence the ſaid ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute did not of the Kings free-will proceed, the ſame ſhould be voyd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It ſeemes at this time, the <hi>King</hi> was not bound to paſſe whatſoever the Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons Voted to be for the good of the kingdome: And his oath did tye him to ſeeke a reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his prerogative againſt ſuch forced lawes, ſo farre was it from tying him to paſſe all ſuch lawes as the Houſes ſhould judge fit.</p>

            <p>Another doubt that perplexeth me, ariſeth from their declaring the priviledge of Parliament to extend to high treaſon; now I do not know that any priviledge can have its ground or commencement, unleſſe it be by ſtatute, grant, or preſcription; no ſtatute, grant, or preſciption can be alledged for this priviledge againſt treaſon; nor indeed can a grant in ſuch caſe hold fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And by the ſtatute 26 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 13. it is enacted, that no offendor in any kinde of high treaſon ſhall have the priviledge of any manner of Sanctuarie: And as there is neither ſtatute nor grant, ſo no preſcription neither to exempt the members of Parliament wholly from puniſhment, nor yet to change the method and manner of their triall: for no preſcription can be, but it muſt be both reaſonable in it ſelfe, and alſo uſed and allowed; now there hath not been nor can be any one inſtance given to prove that this priviledge was either allowed, or ſo much as claimed: nay the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry practiſe hath been witneſſed by <hi>Wentworths</hi> caſe cited by his Majeſtie, whereunto many others might be added: and as it wants allowance or claime, ſo is it in it ſelfe unreaſonable; for if after the riſing of the Houſe, I ſhall overheare or diſcover a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament man plotting treaſon, and ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

May not every Iudge in Weſtminſter Hall claime this priviledge with better colour then a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Parliament, though the Parliament be a higher Court then any of them? For as
<pb facs="tcp:125474:23"/>
the King may impeach one Iudge, ſo more, and then it will be in his pleaſure, or of any other accuſer, to make the ordinarie Courts (though ſetled by preſcription and Acts of Parliament, and leſſe depending upon the will of the King, then doth the being of the two Houſes) what they will, when they will: and then if the King hath any ſuit de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending in the Common Pleas, and finds ſome of the Iudges inclyning againſt him; they may be held under a fained accuſation of Treaſon, till the others have given judgement for the king: Surely though the Parliament be a ſuperiour Court, yet have the ordinary Courts as firme a foundation as that can have, and are more neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the people: and yet without queſtion upon ſuch pretence no judge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> may claime a priviledge from arreſt in Caſe of Treaſon.</p>
            <p>If wee conſult with our Law bookes, they tell us that the priviledge of Parliament doth not extend to Treaſon, nor yet breach of the peace, nor yet (as I thinke) againſt the kings debt; for the reaſon and ground of priviledge is, becauſe the king hath an Intereſt in the members, to have their advice, therefore no ſubject may arreſt them for his debt; But that cannot give them priviledge againſt the king himſelfe. <hi>

            <p>But then whether the forme of the Commiſſion, be legall, I can ſee as little reaſon to doubt, ſeeing it is for ſubſtance and forme both by a very act of Parliament now in force, and by his Majeſties Ceclararation, cleared from all colour of objection? So that in mine owne underſtanding, it ſeemes unqueſtionable both for matter and forme: You will ſay nevertheleſſe, that I ought to ſubmit my underſtanding, and implicity beleeve it illegall, becauſe ſo voted: But this ſound ſomewhat harſh, that we ſhould be bound to ſubmit to ſuch votes, againſt an Act of Parliament, upon record; vnleſſe you can aſſure me that they are proper <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
