         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Preface of <hi>Iohn Wollebius</hi> D.D. to the Reader.</head>
            <p>THE blessed Apostle, in his second Epistle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> cap. 1 vers. 13, writes thus: <hi>Hold fast the form of good words, which thou hast heard of me, in faith and love.</hi> An excellent admonition and worthy to be pressed upon all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stans; but chiefly on these who have wholly devoted themselves to the stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Divinity. For as it concernes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Christian to be skilled in the chief Chatechistical heads at least, that by their help and guide they may with the greater profite heare and read Gods Word; so it becomes all Students in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, before all things to imprint in their memories the <hi>Anatomie</hi> of the Body of <hi>Theologie</hi>; that in the Common places, in the definitions and Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of heavenly doctrine, they may be exact and perfect. Now in this kind di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers eminent men, furnished with a far greater measure of Spiritual <hi>Vnction</hi> than my self, have afforded such helps to young Students, that he, who goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to adde any thing to these<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will seem to light a Candle at noon-day, or to garnish the Firmament with more
<pb facs="tcp:46199:4"/>
Stares: Yet notwithstanding, whereas it is consistant with the conscience and callings of all Gods servants, to advance what they can the publike benefit; I being called to be chief Pastor in this place, was enjoyned by the Reverend Colledge of Divines to expound the Old Testament, which by Gods help and their command I so undertook, that besides my Lectures on the Text, I proposed to my hearers a short form of <hi>wholsom and good words,</hi> taken out of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens lucubrations, and reduced into this brief <hi>Epitome.</hi> Now although I perceived that many did very wel like my paines and purpose in this kind; yet I professe, the divulging of this Piece was least in my thoughts. Therefore, in that at last this Child, of which I have been in labour these seven years, is now born and brought out to light; I earnestly intreat the friendly Reader to impute this, not to any itching hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour I have of writing, but to the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten sollicitations of my Friends, who have extorted it from me, I beseech God, that he will be pleased gracious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to preserve the remaining compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Teachers &amp; Schollers, and that for his mercies sake, whereof we have
<pb facs="tcp:46199:5"/>
daily fresh testimonies, as in many things, so in this, that we are not all destroyed: And as for those who are dispersed that he would graciously re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect and settle them, even for his onely begotten Sons sake our Lord Jesus Christ <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <hi>I.</hi> This word <hi>Theologie,</hi> or <hi>Divinity</hi> is diversely taken: but in this place is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood that knowledge of God, which a Christian may attain unto in this life out of Gods word.</p>
               <p>The word <hi>Theologie</hi> being taken abusively, is sometime used for the Gentiles Divinity, which was threefold: <hi>Poetical,</hi> or fabulous, <hi>Philosophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi>

and end whereof was to contain the rude mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass of obedience by some religious exercise, be what it will. But <hi>Theologie</hi> properly so called, is either Original or derived. Original, is that knowledge where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God knows himself, which really differs not from Gods essence. De<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rived, is a certain im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age or representation of that Orig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nal, primari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Christ our media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, secondarily in Christs members. Now whereas a part of Christs mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers is triumphant in heaven, another part militant here on earth; that Theologie of the triumphant part is cal'd the <hi>Theologie of the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Saints</hi>; that of the militant, is stiled the <hi>Theology of Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers.</hi>

               <p>For Theology, as it is comprehended within certain precepts, is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from the habit of Theology, as the effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cause from the effect.

                     <hi>A. R. Divinity is more speculative, than practical, because it principally handles divine things, and in the second place humane actions. But as it is, a practical science, it is the most noble of all pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical sci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>cts, but as He is known in himself also.</hi>
                  </note> Divinity then consists partly in contemplation, partly in action. Therefore Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity may bear the name both of Sapience, and Prudence; Sapience so far forth as it appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends the Principles by means of the Inteligence being divinely illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated, and from thence demonstrates the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions by means of Science; Of prudence, so far forth as it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects the mind of man in it its actions.</p>

principle of Divinity than the written word of God.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. It is an unquestionable Principle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst Christians, that the Holy Scripture is both of a divine original and authority.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. It is then a question ill beseeming a Christian, to demand whether the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or holy Bible be Gods word or not?</p>
               <p>For as in the Schools there is no desputing with him who denies Principles; so we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count him unworthy to be heard, who will deny this principle of Christian Religion.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. Among Christians it is lawful to ask, By what testimony do we know that the Scriptures are by divine inspiration? So we ask not for this end, to seduce others, or to cavel, but onely to be instructed.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. Now this testimony is twofold the one principal, the other ministerial. The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal testimony is that of the Holy Spirit, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly in the Scripture it self, inwardly in the minds and hearts of the faithful, being illuminate by him, speaking and perswading the divinity of the Scriptures, But the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterial testimony is the testimony of the Church.</p>
               <p>Outwardly in the Scriptures themselves, the holy Ghost, when he speaks of the divine ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal and authority of the VVord, useth these phrases; <hi>The word of the Lord, Thus saith the Lord. Iesus said, All Scripture is by divine inspiration.</hi> 2 Tim 3.16. <hi>Holy men of God
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:46199:12"/>
spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.</hi> But inwardly in the hearts of the faithful he perswades the divinity of Scriptures, so far forth as he openeth the eyes, &amp; illuminates the mind of him that reads the Scripture with prayer and humility, that he makes him see the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of God, and causeth him to acknowledge the voice of Gods Spirit sounding in the Word.</p>
               <p>The Romanists urge the Churches authority alone, which they have in such high esteem, that they will have the whole authority of Scriptures to have its dependence from the Church; and for this only cause they will have it to be Gods Word, because the Church is the witnesse of it, But this is not to make the Church a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the Scriptu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Without whose illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, the wonders of the Scripture are not seen, his testimony alone of the Scripture is most firm: But without the

But it is the office of the Holy Ghost, <hi>to lead us into all truth,</hi> John 16 13. <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c. Now as for the Churches te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony, although it is to be received as from Gods Minister, yet it is false that the Scriptures authority depends on it: For what can be more absurd, than to make the words of the Master to receive their authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from the Servant; or the Fathers letters to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive credit, from the foot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

VVe know that the oracles of God are committed to the Church, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.2. and that she is the pillar &amp; ground of truth. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. But as it is fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish to tell us, that the candle receives its lights from the candle-stick that supports it, so it is ridiculous to ascribe the Scriptures authority to the Church. The Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches testimony may be prevalent with those who as yet know not the Scriptures, and have not <hi>received that sincere milk of the word, nor by it are grown up,</hi> 1 Pet. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. But in those who have tasted the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of divine oracles, the testimony of Scriptures and of the Holy Ghost is most firm and effectual: For as he who tasteth hony himself, hath a more sure knowledge of its sweetnesse, than he that believeth another spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king &amp; witnessing of it: even so, he knoweth more assuredly the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures to be Gods Word, who hath tasted its sweetnesse, than he who gives credite to the

The <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritans</hi> at first belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, the woman when she spake of Christ but after they heard Christ himself, they say to the woman, <hi>Now we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, not because of thy saying, for we have heard him our selves and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of the world,</hi> Joh. 4.42. Even so he that having begged the assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of Gods Spirit reads the Scriptures a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain &amp; again, at length saith, Now I believe no longer for the Churches testimony, that the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures are divine; but because I have read them my self, and in reading have stamped this Syllogism in my minde.</p>

                  <p>Of mans creation, <hi>Moses</hi> writes thus, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. ver. 7. <hi>The Lord breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul.</hi> In this place three things are mentioned: 1.

Because otherwayes our souls should have another original than <hi>Adam</hi>'s had; for ours must proceed of some pre-excistent matter, where as <hi>Adam</hi>'s pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded of none. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will that objection hold concerning the d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>f<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ferent way or reason of generation, and creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for nothing is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated of matter, but what in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was created of matter. 2. Because the soul of Christ was not formed of seed by traduction, for he was conceived not by the the help of man, but by the operation of the holy Ghost of the blessed Virgins blood. 3. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Scripture, when it speaks of the original of our souls, it speaks as of a work of Creation, not of nature, <hi>Iob.</hi> 33.4. <hi>The spirit of God hath made me: and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life.</hi> Zac. 12.1. <hi>The Lord stretcheth out the heavens, and layeth the foundation of the earth, and formeth the spirit of man within him</hi>; where it is plain that this is reckoned among the works of Creation. 4. Such is mans genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as his dissolution is, but mans dissolution is, that his body returns to dust, and his spirit to God that gave it, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 127. VVhereas then in mans dissolution, the spirit returns immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to God, doubtless it was immediatly formed by him. 5 Because the Scripture doth plainly distinguish between the parts of bodies &amp; spirits, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.9.6. Because the soul is indivisible into parts, therefore cannot be produced but of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. 7. Because if it were generated by traduction, either it
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:46199:36"/>
must be generated of a soul, or of a body, or of a soul and body together: but it is not generated of a soul, <note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <hi>A. R. The soul could not be produced out of any preexistent matter; neither corporeal, because it is not a body, nor incorporal, because spirits, and incorporeal substances admit no change or trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation.</hi>
                     </note>because of that which is incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible nothing can be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated; not of a body, because it is not corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real; not of a body and soul together, because so it should be partly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal, partly incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> seeing then it is produced of nothing, it must be produced by God alone, whose alone property it is to make things of nothing.</p>

                     <hi>III.</hi> These physical Axiomes, <hi>like begets like,</hi> and, <hi>Man begets man;</hi> remaine true also in this case: both because man begets man, a person begets a person; as also because by the work of the Parents the body is begot, as it were the subject of the soul, and so is united to the soul, which is infused by God, and thus the whole man is brought into this World by generation.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, that man is the efficient cause of man, but not according to all his parts: for as he is said to kill a man, that kills only his body; so man is said to beget man, though he begets not the soul.

               <p>THat Sin which is derived from the first or primitive Sin, is either origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal or actual; original Sin is that native corruption derived into the whole man and to the whole race of man naturally descending from <hi>Adam,</hi> whereby man having utterly lost his freedom to good, becomes prone to evil.</p>

                  <head>The RULES.</head>
                  <p n="1">I. <hi>The interpretation of every precept, is to be sought out of its next end.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">II. <hi>Whereas the precepts are most brief, they are also Synecdochical: for out of negatives we must understand affirmatives and contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, so things forbid, out of things commanded, and on the contrary; out of the</hi> species <hi>the</hi> ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, <hi>and contrarily out of the outward wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, we understand the inward, and on the contrary; out of things done, and spoken, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, counsels and actions; and finally, out of relatives we are to understand correlatives.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">III. <hi>One and the same thing may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to divers precepts in divers respects.</hi>

                  <p n="4">IV. <hi>A general Law yields to a particular.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">V. <hi>There is a greater force or emphasis in negatives than in affirmatives.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For negatives are of a far larger extent; whereas affirmatives in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>clude circumstances: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmatives oblige alway but not incessantly; whereas negatives ob<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lige both always, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessantly. For example, we are alwayes bound to do our neighbour good, but not incessant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for there's not conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually occasions to do him good: on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, it is never lawfull to hurt our neighbour.</p>

                     <pb n="64" facs="tcp:46199:56"/>VI. <hi>Hence there are more negative than affirmative precepts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">VII. <hi>Every sin bears the name of that sin, which by name is prohibited.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The reason is that we may take the more notice of the filthiness of sin; so Christ calls a wanton look upon a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>adultery</hi>; and <hi>Iohn</hi> calls hatred <hi>murther,</hi> Matth. 5.28. 1 <hi>Iohn.</hi> 3.15.</p>
                  <p n="8">VIII. <hi>Earthly promises are symbols of heavenly things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore the <hi>Serve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi> and <hi>Anabaptists</hi> do falsly dream that these promises are one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly earthly, the earth<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly promises include heavenly: for so it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed God to apply him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to that ignorant people, and as yet under the Paedagogie of the Law.</p>

                  <p>The Preface of <hi>Moses</hi> is this, <hi>Then God spake all these words.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Gods preface is this, <hi>I am the Lord thy God which brought thee out of Egypt.</hi>

               <p>A Sacrament is a Sacred action in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted by God, in which that grace which Christ hath promised to the Covenanters is sealed by visible signes on Gods part, and they are tyed on their part to obedience</p>

                  <p>For by Sacraments, as it were by solemn oaths, we are bound to observe what is promised in the Covenant; and the same are to us pledges of grace promised in the Covenant.</p>

                     <hi>VIII.</hi> The word of institution doth not change the quality, or substance of the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but only their use, and that not by any secret vertue inherent in the words them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, as the Papists say, but by Gods ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>As a stone by the Magistrates appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is changed into a landmark, the substance and qualities thereof still remaining: so, as <hi>Austin</hi> saith, the Word being joyned to the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it becomes a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, the quality and substance remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, onely the common use is changed into a sacred.</p>

                  <p n="12">
                     <hi>XII.</hi> The inward or heavenly matter, is the thing signified, to wit Christ with all his benefits.</p>

                     <hi>XIII.</hi> The external form consisteth in the lawful administration and participation of the Sacrament according to Gods command.</p>

                     <hi>XIV.</hi> The internal forme is the analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie of the sign and thing signified.</p>
                  <p n="15">
                     <hi>XV.</hi> Therefore the union of the sign, and thing signified, is not physical or local, but habitual, as the signe represents the thing signified; and while the signe is given by the Minister, the faithfull receive the thing signified from Christ.</p>
                  <p n="16">
                     <hi>XVI.</hi> Yet we deny not the presence of Christ, and of his body and blood, in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Sacrament: for besides that he is present in his Divine Person, he is not wanting in the presence of his Spirit to his own body and blood, not locally, but sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally.</p>
                  <p>There is a threefold presence, besides that which is local. 1. Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical; when things are represented to the mind by some sign or symbol, as things by words or voices, man by his i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage. 2. Spiritual when we represent to our selves, by faith some spiritual thing nor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent;
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:46199:98"/>
as <hi>Abraham</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to himself and saw the day of Christ, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8.56. 3. A Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, when that which is distant in place, is present in power and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy: as the Sun. These three ways of Presence meet in the Sacrament: for the body and blood of Christ are present to us, 1. Symbollically, as they are represented by an external sign. 2. Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually, as we apply by faith, to our selves Christs body and blood with his merits. 3. Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, as we perceive the fruit thereof by faith in our hearts. The first degree of Sacramental presence, belongs also to infidels; the second and third, to the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full only. Therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Christs body by local presence is far di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant from the symbole, as heaven is from earth, yet there is a sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental presence. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence is not opposed to distance, but to absence.</p>
                  <p n="17">
                     <hi>XVII,</hi> Neither are therefore Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments empty signes, because the symbole and thing signified are not locally united; for there remain notwithstanding, <hi>1.</hi> The signes signifying, <hi>2.</hi> Exhibiting, <hi>3.</hi> Applying, <hi>4.</hi> Sealing.</p>
                  <p>We must carefully observe these four sorts of signes, against those who cry out that we have nothing in the Sacraments but empty signes. Signes then are either significant only, as a painted image signifieth a man; or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting also, as a scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, keys, and such like, which being exhibited, regal power is also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, and leave to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the house: or they are besides applying signes, as that promise of God to preserve the 144000. this the Angel applieth
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:46199:99"/>
to each one, by setting a mark on his fore-head <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.3. Or lastly, they are confirming and sealing signs, as earnests, seals, and such like. Now these four degrees meet in Sacraments: for, 1. The outward symbols do signifie and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Christs body and blood. 2. Together with the signe, the thing signified is exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited; yet not in the signe, but in the Sacramental action; the Minister exhibiting the signe, and Christ the things signified. 3. The thing signified generally prom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Three thnigs are required to a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. 1. That it be instituted by God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Covenant of Grace. 2. That it may have an external Symbol ordained by God. 3. That the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of grace may be annexed to it. Now these three belong on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Baptisme and the Lords Supper, and
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:46199:103"/>
not to any of the rest. Confirmation is a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish ceremony, in which the Bishop or his Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragan having asked certain questions of the party baptized, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Heads of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, besmears him with a little oyntment, putting a linnen cloth on him, not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved by the witnesses before the third day; and he cuffs him, the better to remember the matter, and that he may be sufficiently furnished with the holy Ghost a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Satans tentations. But where in Scripture do we read of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and of its cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies? where is the Promise? We may more truly call this the Popes excrement; than a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament and that mark which the Beast puts upon the forehead of his worshippers, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.16<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Therefore im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piously do they prefer this Sacrament to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism; for they teach plainly, that Baptism is perfected by it, and that in this there is a great<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>r measure of spiritual gifts than in Baptism: and whereas any Priest or Pastor may admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister Baptism, yea any Lay man, or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; Confirmation must onely be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the Bishop or his Suffragan. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance is a Sacrament with them, in which the sinner having given tryall of his repentance, is absolved by the Priest. We indeed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is enjoyned to sinners, and that power of absolving is given to Ministers; though they feign a far other penance and absoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as shall appear hereafter: But in the mean while, there is no outward symbol in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted by God which hath a promise; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can these words, [<hi>I absolve thee</hi>] be in stead of a symbol, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> would have it. Extream Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is a Sacrament
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:46199:103"/>
amongst them, in which the Priest having rehearsed some Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanies, anointeth the party that is dying, with hallowed oyl of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, in those parts of the body, where the seats of the five Senses are; and this he doth after the parties confession and absolution, to the end he may recover his health, if it be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient for him, and that the remainder of his sins, after he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the other Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, may be wiped away. Christ indeed promised his Disciples, that the sick, on whom they were to lay their hands, should recover, <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.18. <hi>Iames</hi> also commanded that the sick should be a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nointed; after impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of hands and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er by the Elders: which ceremonies were not Sacraments, but volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary rites joyned with miracles, which toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the gifts of miracles are expired. Therefore between ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme Unction, and this, there is no simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude: For, that I may say nothing of that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical exorcism with which the oyle is hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, it is certain, that in the Apostles time, not onely dying people (as now in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery) but any also that were sick; were anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Ordination is a Sacrament among them, in which the Bishop alone or his Suffragan layeth his hands upon the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, and delivereth to him with solemn words a Book, a Platter, a a Pastoral staff, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing also the ceremonies of Unction &amp; Shaving, and imprints on him an indeleble character, to confer Justifying grace. Whereby he might rightly use the power of the Keyes.

               <p>THus in two Chapters we have considered the Church in her self: Now of the False Church, which is opposite to her, and her Enemy.</p>
               <p>The Churches Enemies are either open, or secret.</p>
               <p>These are called, in <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.8. <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi>; that is covered and uncovered.</p>
               <p>Her open foes are Heathens, Jews, and Mahumetans. The Heathens are they, who feign, paint, and worship false and fictitious Gods.</p>
               <p>The Jews deny the Trinity, and the coming of the Messiah, and interpret carnally, what is spoken of Christs Kingdome in the Prophets spiritually.</p>
               <p>The Mahumetans prefer their <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> to Christ, and their <hi>Alcoran</hi> to the Scriptures; which <hi>Alcoran</hi> that Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor compiled by the help of a Nesto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Monk and an Arrian, out of the

sink of Gentilisme, Judaisme, Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheisme, Arrianisme, &amp; other heresies.</p>
               <p>The hid or counterfeit Enemies, are either false Christs, or Antichrists: False Christs are they, who brag themselves to be Christ.</p>
               <p>As <hi>Simon Magus, Barcochab, Moses Cretensis, David Georgius,</hi> and such like.</p>
               <p>Antichrists are, commonly, all He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes; but particularly, and by way of excellency, that great Antichrist.</p>

               <p>Heretikes are they, who maintain stubbornly against the plain light of truth, any doctrine which overthrows directly, or by necessary consequence the fundamentals of Christian faith.</p>

He shall be abolished by the glorious coming of Christ, 2. Thes. 2.8. When he shall be cast into that Lake of fire which burns with brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.20.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <hi>IV.</hi> This discription sheweth not only what, but who this great Antichrist is, for that must needs be the thing defined, to which the definition belongeth: but the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition belongs to the Pope, therefore he is the thing defined.</p>
                  <p>The Minor is proved by an induction or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of each mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. 1. The first member is out of question; for every one knows that the Popes succeed each other. 2. The second member is manifest both by its effects, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so by their example, who have attaind that Seat by wicked arts and wayes, as <hi>Alexander</hi> the sixth, <hi>Sylvester</hi> the second, <hi>Benedict</hi> the ninth, of whom see <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina</hi> and other Popish Writers. 3 By professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Pope will not deny himself to be a Christian. 4. That he is Christs Enemy, and that he hath made horns to
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:46199:128"/>
himselfe like those of the Lamb, is apparent; because he claimes to himselfe Christs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical, Sacerdotal and Regal offices: toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the titles of High Priest, Prince of Pastors, Head and Husband of the Church <hi>&amp;c.</hi> while he casts by Christs word as needless and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure, like a nose of wax, equalling, yea, preferring his tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to it: He over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws Christs Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical office, whilst he urgeth the merits and intercession of <hi>Mary</hi> and of the Saints: He destroys Christs Preisthood, and his kingly office, whist he takes upon him to do what he pleaseth in the Church. But if you compare Christs life with the Popes, the humility of the one with the pride of the other, the doctrine of the one with the doctrine of the other, concerning Free will, justification, the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and such like articles, it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that fire and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter are not more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. 5. That he sits in the Temple of God, that is, in the Church which is his Temple, as is said, is manifest. Now the Roman Church, as it is Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish, is not called the Temple of God. But 1. As in <hi>Iohns</hi> time it was the true Church of Christ; and so the Temple of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> of old, was called the Temple of God, though it had been converted to a den of theeves, <hi>Ier</hi> 7. <hi>ver.</hi> 11. 2. As God hath there yet those that belong to election. The Pope is born in the Church, he sits in her, not as her true and natural Son, but as a Monster, a bunch or swelling, or as a canker clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving fast to the body. Furthermore, that he sits there as God, the titles which his Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

These do agree so fitly with <hi>Rome,</hi> that some Jesuites are forced to confesse that <hi>Rome,</hi> is that Beast. 7. As for Miracles; there is no thing more usuall in Popery than to brag of miracles; but what are they? they are lying wonders: <hi>He maketh fire to come down from Heaven,</hi> that is, by the thunder of excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, he brings the fire of Gods wrath from Heaven; in token whereof, when he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth about to excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate Kings and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, he flings down from the Capitol burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing torches: but if you look upon the literal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, <hi>Hilde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brand</hi> was wont to shake sparkles of fire out of his sleeves; And they record in their <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gends,</hi> that at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests of holy men, fire hath been brought down from Heaven. But <hi>he gives life also to the image of the Beast.</hi> By the name of image, ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry is understood, by introducing of which, the Gentile idolatry, as it were raised again out of the grave, was restored and quickned: but in a litteral sense this is true; for it is known how Papists have caused their images laugh, weep, speak, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We read in the <hi>Legend</hi> of <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> that when he had presented to Christs image the third part of his Theologie, He asked if he had written well or not? The image answered; <hi>Thomas, thou hast written well of me.</hi> 8. He puts a mark upon his followers, in which apishly he imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates Christ, who signs

And it is that voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereby God calls the Elect, as yet in themselves miserable and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted; outwardly, by the Word of the Gospel; but inwardly, by illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating the minde and changing the heart, to be partakers of the grace of Salvation.</p>

                     <hi>IV</hi> The matter or object of vocation, is man elected, but in himself as yet miserable, natural, carnal, sinful, estranged from the life of God, yea, dead in sin.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eph. 2.1.</hi> And you to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether hath he quickned, when you were dead in sins and trespasses. <hi>Col. 2.13.</hi> And you that were dead in your sins hath he quickned. <hi>Tit. 3.3.</hi> For we our selves also were somtimes foolish, disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, deceived, serving diverse lusts and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, living in malice and envy, hatefull and hating one another.</p>

                     <hi>V.</hi> Therefore the <hi>Semipelagians</hi> erre, when they give to man a preparation, or a propension to hearken to his vocation.</p>
                  <p>The reason is plain by what we have said; for how can a dead man raise himself? No more can man further his own vocation.</p>
                  <p n="6">
                     <hi>VI.</hi> Yet man is not like a stock, when he is called: for he is the fit subject of vocation; seeing he is not a Lion, nor a Dog, but a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional creature; yet his reason helps him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to his vocation, till it be enlightened.</p>

                     <hi>VII.</hi> 'Tis absurd to extend this grace of vocation to all men: whereas common voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (of which already) happeneth not to all men, as the whole story of the Old Testament teacheth; For not the <hi>Gentiles</hi> but <hi>Jews</hi> were called.</p>
                  <p n="8">
                     <hi>VIII.</hi> The forme consisteth in the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous change of mans mind and heart, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by not onely is the mind illuminated, but our stony hearts also are made fleshy, and fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to obedience.</p>
                  <p>This appears sufficiently out of what is said, especially out of <hi>Ezech.</hi> 36.</p>

                     <hi>IX.</hi> Therefore the <hi>Arminian</hi> Novelists falsly teach, that the understanding is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with knowledge, &amp; that the affections are irresistibly excited; but that its left in the freedome of the will to believe, or not to believe: That the power to believe is given by irresistible grace, but not the act.</p>
                  <p>This errour is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly overthrown by that which God pronounces concerning the change of the heart, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 36.26. So Christ witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, that not onely the Elect do hear and learn of God, but all that have been taught come to him, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.45.</p>

                     <hi>X.</hi> The grace of Vocation is plainly ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resistible, not if you look upon our corrupted nature, which is harder than a stone; but in respect of the Holy Ghost, by whom the Elect are so drawn, that they follow inevitably.</p>
                  <p n="11">
                     <hi>XI.</hi> This drawing is no wayes violent, nor doth it resist the natural liberty of the will; which of its own nature being corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and bent to evil only, when the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit toucheth it, presently and freely it follows.</p>
                  <p>This drawing is like that of the Shepheard, when with a green Branch he draws the sheep after him, which follows not violently, but spontaneously; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this be not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether alike; because the sheep is allured by its natural inclination, but man by that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pension which the Holy Ghost hath put in him; God indeed calls out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, but withall he illuminates the minde inwardly, that man might know the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of his vocation; so God moves the heart, that it might obey.</p>
                  <p n="12">
                     <hi>XII.</hi> The <hi>Novelists</hi> also falsly teach, that sufficient grace is given to all men, but not the act it self of accepting and using that grace.</p>
                  <p>This opinion over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws it self; for if the grace of believing is not given in respect of the act, then grace is not sufficient, seeing no man is saved, but he that believes: We con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess indeed, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon vocation is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent

Again, nature may he called grace: for whatsoever is not of due debt, is of grace; such is nature, and all natural pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and actions; for it is of grace, that we live, move, and have our being in God; who is the prime and universal cause, without Whose influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the second &amp; subordinate causes cannot work: and therefore, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But saving grace is distinguished from nature, as the garment from the body; the one may be lost with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the other: And so when the Fathers speak of <hi>Adam's</hi> original justice, they say, he lost his garment and was stripp'd naked.</note> The <hi>Pelagians</hi> absurdly teach that by the grace of Vocation, we are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand our natural abilities.</p>

                     <pb n="249" facs="tcp:46199:133"/>For the Scripture ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thus useth the word <hi>Grace</hi>: but means ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that grace which makes us acceptable, or that grace which is free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given.

               <p>Justification is Gods free action, whereby the Elect, through the most full satisfaction of Christ, are absolved from their sins, and are declared righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, and inheritors of life eternal.</p>

                     <hi>I.</hi> Iustice in Scripture, is either of the Cause, or of the person. Iustice of the cause is, when a man, otherwise sinfull, is said in this or that particular to be innocent and just: Iustice of the person, is either begun, or it is perfected. This is called Legal, as it is required by the Law; and <hi>Evangelical,</hi> as it is shewed in Christ by the Gospel. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun justice, is that which the Holy Ghost begins in the faithful in this life, and
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:46199:137"/>
perfects it in the other. The perfect righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse of Christ then is the gift of Iustification; but that which is begun, is the gift of Sanctification.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. To justifie, in this place, is not to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish, nor to infuse inherent righteousnesse, as the Pontificians will have it: but in the sense it is taken in the Courts of justice, it is to absolve from sin, and to pronounce one just.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prov. 17.15.</hi> To justifie the wicked, and to condemn the just, both are abomination to the Lord. <hi>Isa. 5.23.</hi> which justifie the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and take away the righteousnesse of the righteous. <hi>Matth. 11.19.</hi> wisdome is justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by her children, <hi>Lu. 7.29.</hi> when these things were heard, all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and the Publicans justified God. <hi>Luk. 10.29.</hi> He willing to justifie himself.</p>

                     <hi>That this is a free fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and not an infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed grace, will appear by these testimonies</hi> Rom. <hi>3.24.</hi> For they are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified freely by his grace, <hi>Ephes. 2.8.</hi> you are sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by grace through faith, and that not of your selves, it is the gift of God. <hi>Tit. 3.4.5.</hi> But after the goodnesse and love of God our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our appeared towards man, not by the works which we had done, but by his mercy he hath saved us.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. The external moving cause, is Christ, God and man.</p>
                  <p>Christ as the Son of God, is the efficient cause of justification in common with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Holy Ghost: but as he is God-man and our Mediator, he is the outward moving cause, because by his merit he hath procured this gift for us.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. The instrumental cause of this, is the word of the Gospel.</p>

                     <hi>X.</hi> Faith doth not justifie as if it were a work, or by its own dignity, but as it is an instrument apprehending Christ.</p>
                  <p>The Papists grant, that we are justified by faith: but then they take faith here as a work. Now faith in Scripture hath nothing ascribed to it, but as it aprehends, as a Gold-ring bears a high price for the Jewel in it. And hence it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears how finely those places of Scripture do agree, in which we are said to be justified, now by grace, then by Christs merits, then by faith: for we are justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through Gods grace for Christs merits ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended by faith.</p>

                     <hi>XI.</hi> The matter of justification taken actively, is Christs whole satisfaction, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he suffered the punishment due to our sins, and yielded perfect obedience to the Law.</p>

                     <hi>XII.</hi> The matter of this taken passively, is man, miserable in himself, but elected by God, called and indowed with faith. Though then vocation naturally, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore faith, and faith before justification, yet in time there is no difference.</p>
                  <p>For as soon as man is effectually called, he is endowed with faith, and justified by faith.</p>

                     <hi>XIII.</hi> The form of it, actively under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, is in the imputation of Christs whole satisfaction, whereby it is made all ours, as if we had performed it our selves.</p>
                  <p>That justice which is imputed to the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, is in Christ by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hesion, in us by imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Our adversaries deny, that in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture there is any menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this imputation: But what can be cleerer than these ensuing pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.6. <hi>As David calleth that man blessed, unto whom God impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teh righteousnesse with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out works,</hi> Phil. 3.8.9. <hi>I account all things dung that I may gain Christ, and may be found in him, not having my own righteousnesse, which is of the Law, but that which is by the faith of Christ, that is the righteousnes which is of God by faith.</hi> This is chiefly seen in that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tithesis whereby our sins are imputed to Christ, and his justice imputed to us. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5 21. <hi>He
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:46199:139"/>
made that he should be sinne for us who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.</hi> The Papists also think it as absurd, that we should be justified by the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice of another; as if one would be called learned for the learning that is in another. But these examples are not like: for one man is not so united to another, as the faithfull are to Christ, their head, Againe, they will not have Christs justice imputed to them; and yet they stick not to say, that the merits of dead men, and the Justice of Monks are imputed to them.</p>
                  <p n="14">
                     <hi>XIV.</hi> Yet, for understandings sake, the form of justification is expressed by two acts; by remission of sinns, and imputation of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice; by judging our sins to be none, and our righteousnesse to be perfect.</p>

                  <p>Here divers things are objected, 1. The Scripture in many places makes mention of Christs passion, or Remission of sins one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. But this is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, for in many places, it speaks Synecdochi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally; it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>. 2. The Apostle pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miscuously useth these phrases as equivalent; <hi>to forgive sins, and to impute righteousnesse.</hi> Rom. 4.5, 6. But we answer, that it is one thing for propositions to be equivalent, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other thing for one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to follow upon, or to conclude another: as <hi>Paul</hi> out of this phrase of <hi>David,</hi> Psal. 32.2. <hi>Blessed are they whose sins are forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them,</hi> &amp;c. collects this, that <hi>David doth describe him to be bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to whom righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is imputed wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ks.</hi> The reason of the consequence is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause if the remission of sins be free, then so is also the imputation of justice: Although then that is not formally spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by <hi>David,</hi> which <hi>Paul</hi> affirmeth, <hi>v.</hi> 5. yet it is spoken by way of consequence: yea it is an argumentation, as <hi>Chrysostome</hi> saith, from the lesser to the greater; for if he be blessed whose sins are forgiven, then much more blessed is he to whom besides righteousnesse is imput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ee. 3. To whom sins are forgiven, to him also righteousnesse is imputed; and whosoever is freed from damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he is inheritor of life

eternal: therefore these benefits are not diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. <hi>Answ.</hi> Those things are not the same which are in the same subject together: For so it would follow that Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, Justification, and Sanctification are not different benefits, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause every man that is called is also justified and sanctified. 4. In the pardon of sins, there are the sin of omission pardoned; and therefore by that man is made perfectly just: They adde the reason of the consequence; because he performs all things, who omits nothing, <hi>Ans</hi> The consequence is fals, because there is one cause why we are said to have omitted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, another, why we are said to have done al things. We are said to have omitted nothing, because Christ hath suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for our sins also of omission: But we are said to have performed all things, because he hath for us performed all things. Besides, to have omitted nothing; and to have done all thinges, differ in respect of punishment and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: for although the fault &amp; the punishment are remited to him who omits what he shold do, yet for this there is no reward due to him. 5. It is absurd, that the same debt should be paid twice: If therefore sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction is made for sin by Christs suffering, satisfaction also is not to be demanded by active obedience. <hi>Answ.</hi> Here is <hi>ignoratio Elenchi</hi>; for there is not a double payment of the same debt, but two parts of one payment, Neither is Christs active obedience required to make satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for sin, but to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie for our interest in the Kingdome of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. 6. If it be the same thing to be liberal and not to be prodigal, nor covetous; then it is the same thing to be just, and not unjust. <hi>Answ.</hi> The assumption is false, be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Because this visible world was made for man to sojourn in whilest he was a tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller; but when his journey is ended, and he in Heaven, there will be no more need of this world. 2. Because this stands with the order of things: For seeing eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity belongs to God, who is without beginning &amp; ending; but to Spirits, <hi>aevum,</hi> which is that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration that hath begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but wants ending to Physical things time is ascribed, consisting both of beginning and ending. To the former objections thus they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer: The place of <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.19, 20, 21, 22. is not meant of the restaurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this world, but of its freedome from vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to which it is subject, which vanity consists in this, that most men do most wickedly abuse the service of the creatures; hence by <hi>Prosopopoeia</hi> or fiction of the person, they are said to desire liberty. The place in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.31. teacheth ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the contrary, to wit, that this world shall not remain; although in that place mention is

<pb n="305" facs="tcp:46199:161"/>
not made of the world it self, so much as world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, to wit, riches pleasures and such like. They teach, that the new heaven in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. and <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. doth as it were point out the new world which the elect shall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habite in their heavenly countrey. For there is nothing more frequent than that allegory, whereby the heaven of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>he blessed is likened sometimes to the earth, sometimes to the visible heaven: and to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, is that which <hi>Peter</hi> saith of righteousnesse, which shall dwell there For it is certain, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this world, justice shall dwell no where but in heaven. To the first reason, they answer, that there is no consequence from the Flood to the last Judgment, because the Flood brought not with it the end of the world: so likewise in the other reason, they deny the sequel from man to the world; because the world will be no wayes available to man, when he is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to life eternall, for it was made onely for him whilest he was a traveler here.

                     <hi>I.</hi> Good works are called Vertues.</p>
                  <p>But we take this word <hi>vertue</hi> in a larger sense<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than it is taken by Philosophers: for here we call <hi>vertues</hi> holy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, holy thoughts and actions.</p>

                     <hi>III</hi> The principal efficient cause of good works; is the Holy Ghost in respect of begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, continuation, and perfection.</p>

                  <p>For sin is a transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Law, <hi>1 Joh. 3.4.</hi> that must needs be sin, which deviates from the Law.</p>
                  <p n="7">
                     <hi>VII.</hi> Therefore those are not good works, which are conformable te the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of men, and not of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Isa. 29.13. Matth. 15 9.</hi> In vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of men.</p>
                  <p n="8">
                     <hi>VIII.</hi> Neither are those good works, which the Papists call works of <hi>Superero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,</hi> by which they say more is performed than by the Law is required.</p>
                  <p n="9">
                     <hi>IX</hi> This opinion is grounded upon their conceit of Councels or things not command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but left to our liberty; the omission of which is not punishable, but the performance is greater than legal obedience, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore meritorious.</p>
                  <p>They say, such Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels may be seen, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. v. 11. where they teach, that the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel of single life is not contained within the command, and. <hi>ver.</hi> 21. where they say, that to the young man a-counsel was given, not a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand, that he should sell his goods, and give them to the poor, and then follow Christ: and 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 7. where they say, that the single life is counselled.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="314" facs="tcp:46199:166"/>But this opinion of Councels, and works of supererogation is false. 1. Because so the Law is made imperfect, whilst the performing of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels is preferred to the fulfilling of the Law. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Because if no man is able to fulfill the Law, much less able is any man to fulfil that which is heavier than the Law. 3. Because to beg daily for pardon of our sins, and to brag of such works, are things incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent.</p>
                  <p>The places above al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged are to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of commands and not of Councels, which do not oblige men; these commands indeed are particular, and given only to certain men ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the exigence of their condition and gifts; yet they are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate to general pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts. <hi>Matth.</hi> 29.11. Single life is not only counselled, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded; two conditions being required. 1. If the kingdom of Heaven doth so require it. 2. If any be assured that he hath the gift of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinency, so <hi>ver.</hi> 2.1. It is not a counsel, but a command that is given to the young man, that his hypocrisie might be unmasked, who bragg'd that he was able to fulfil all the Law. And 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. Celibate is injoyned to them that have the gift of continency, not simply, but because it was expedient for the difficulty of those times. Now I pray, what is more consonant to Gods Law, than to renounce all earthly things for the glory of God, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in these places no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is counselled, but what by the Law is commanded.</p>

               <p>Wisdome is that vertue, by which we

know Gods will, and our own infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; that we may do what is conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Gods will, and may seriously beseech God for strength to perform this will.</p>

               <p>Prudence is a vertue, whereby we foresee how things are to be done in respect of time, place, and manner, and what will be the event of each busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse which is undertaken</p>

               <p>SO much of the general Vertues or Works: the special, belong to the immediate, or mediate worship of God.</p>
               <p>Gods immediate worship, is that which is performed to him immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and is taught in the first Table.</p>
               <p>This is either internal onely, or else external, and internal both.</p>
               <p>The internal worship only, is that which resides in the heart, and is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned in the first Precept.</p>
               <p>The sum whereof is, that we worship and know him alone for the true God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For the precept is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative,</hi> Thou shall have no other Gods but me: <hi>from this is gathered an affirmative,</hi> Know and worship me alone for God.</p>
               <p>Therefore to this precept belongs the knowledge of God, and a religious affection towards him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="323" facs="tcp:46199:170"/>The knowledg of God is, whereby we acknowledg him to be the onely true God, as he reveals himself to us in Scripture:

               <p>For to acknowledge any for God, is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, to place trust and confidence in him, to love and fear him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all things, to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit patiently to his wil, and to acknowledge all good things for his gift<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>Contrary to this, is distrust in God, and trust or confidence in Idols.</p>

help of the Syrians, and consulted with Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, not with God; 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.7. and 12. Yet it is lawful to make use of outward helps and aid, so we place not confidence in them; we must use them as ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, not trust in them as gods.</p>
               <p>Hope is that, whereby we expect undoubtedly Gods future favours, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially the accomplishment of our salvation relying on Gods promises, and Christs merits.</p>
               <p>Hope differs from faith, as the effect from the cause: for the object of faith, is the promise on which faith relies; the object of hope, is the thing promised, which hope expects.</p>
               <p>Contrary to these are doubting, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speration and idolatrous hope.</p>
               <p>Sometimes the godly fall into doubting, 1 Sam 27, 1. <hi>David said in his heart, I shall now perish one day by the hand of</hi> Saul. But the wicked onely fall into a total and final despera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: so did <hi>Cain,</hi> Gen. 4. <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 Sam. 28. &amp; 31 <hi>Achitophel,</hi> 2 Sam. 17. <hi>Iudas,</hi> Matth. 27 &amp; such like; Idolatrous hope is in Papists, who call the Wooden Crosse, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> &amp;c. their hope; and expect life eternall for their merits, satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and indulgences.</p>
               <p>Charity is that, whereby God is lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved sincerely, and above all things else, as the chief good.</p>
               <p>For so it is commanded, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.5. <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.37</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="326" facs="tcp:46199:172"/>Contrary to this, is the hatred of God and idolatrous love; whereby the World and the things therein, are lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved more than God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Joh. 15.24.</hi> They have hated both me and my Father. <hi>1. Joh. 2.15.</hi> If any man love the World, the love of the Father is not in him.</p>
               <p>The fear of God is, whereby we so reverence Gods word and majesty, that by all means we are loth to offend so bountiful a Father, not so much out of the fear of punishment, as the love of God.</p>
               <p>The fear of God is somtimes taken for the whole worship of God; but here that vertue is understood, which is called filial fear.</p>
               <p>To these are opposite, carnal secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, servile, and idolatrous fear.</p>
               <p>The security of the godly differs farre from that of the wicked: for in the one, the fear of God is not lost; in the other the fear of God is not found. Servile fear differs from filial: 1, Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lial fear proceeds from the love of God; but Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile, from the fear or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of God. 2. In filiall we feare to offend God, because he is a Father; in servile, we fear to be punished by him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is a judge: 3. Filial, draws a man to God; servile, drives a man from God. Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous fear is, when one is more afraid of men and the world, than of God, Matt 10.28. <hi>Fear not them that can kill the body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="327" facs="tcp:46199:172"/>Repentance is, whereby we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge our sins, and bewail them being acknowledged; and with all chear up our selves in the assurance of Gods mercy through Christs merits, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve to obey God, and to refrain from sin.</p>

               <head>CHAP. V. Of Vertues and Works belonging in special to the Second Commandment.</head>
               <p>IN true Religion, we must consider its parts, and time, appointed by God.</p>
               <p>The parts are two: to wit, the form or rite whereby God will be worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in his Church: and the Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Name, all the rest of our life</p>
               <p>The form of his worship, is that which he hath prescribed to us in his Word, which is handled in the Second Precept; the summe whereof is this: <hi>That God should be worshipped in such man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as he hath prescribed to his Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This appears by the right Analysis of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Command, which is foolishly confounded with the first: For as in the first Command is set down, who must be worshipped for God; so in the second is shewed after what manner he will be worshipped. And as in the first, internal i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry is contrary; so in the Second, external is opposed to this worsh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>p The parts of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand are two; a Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition and a Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Of the Prohibition there are two branches: the first is, of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king; the second of the worshipping of Idols. Of the making he saith,
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:46199:176"/>
                  <hi>Thou shal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> not make to thy self any graven image, or likeness, &amp;c.</hi> which he illustrates by enumeration of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars following, to wit, <hi>of any things in Heaven a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bove, or in the earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, or in the waters under the earth.</hi> The veneration of idols is declared two-wayes: 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by bowing to them, 2. by worshipping of them The Confirmation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains a threatning, and a promise; both are illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated from the nature of God, &amp; from the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: In the one he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes himselfe to be a <hi>jealous God visiting ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities &amp;c.</hi> In the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>merciful.</hi> In the one, he denounceth pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment <hi>to the third and fourth generation of them that hate him</hi>; but in the other, <hi>his mercy of the thousand genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them that love him.</hi> It is easie then to see what is the summe of this precept, by the proceeding thereof, 1. From the particular to the general; for Idolatry is forbid, with all such rites as are either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to, or not contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Word of God. 2. From the negation to the affirmation of the contrary: for it is commanded that we worship God in that way which he hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed to us.</p>
               <p>In the rites prescribed to the Church we must observe both the helps and parts thereof.</p>
               <p>The parts are, the right use of the Word and Sacraments and Prayer.</p>
               <p>The right use or handling of the Word and Sacraments is, when the one is preached, the other administred according to Christs institution.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="336" facs="tcp:46199:177"/>Prayer is, whereby we speak to God in the true and humble contrition of heart, of such things as are agreeable to his holy will. This consisteth in cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling upon God, or in giving of thanks.</p>

               <p>SO much of the manner of Gods Worship; the hollowing of his Name in all the rest of our life, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned in the third Commandment; The sum whereof is, that we must stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in all things to sanctifie the Name of God, even out of the times of his ordinary Worship</p>
               <p>There be two parts of this command; a pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>hib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>tion, and a confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of it. The prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition is: <hi>Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain.</hi> The Name of God doth not only signifie the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles which are given to him, but his properties also, his word, works, and whatsoever else be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the glorifying of his Name; out of his prohibition is ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered a precept: <hi>Thou shalt sanctifie the name of thy God:</hi> the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation is a heavy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination; <hi>For the Lord will not hold him guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse that takes his name in vain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Sanctification of Gods Name is considered, either in affection, or in effect.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="356" facs="tcp:46199:187"/>In affection, is zeal for Gods glory; to wit, a vehement affection of the mind to maintain &amp; inlarge the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Gods Name, with just sorrow &amp; indignation against those things, that are contrary to his glory.</p>

                  <p>Sortiledge or casting of lots, is a try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al or finding out that which God hath appointed to each man in divisions; and this is done by external signes to compose strife.</p>

                     <hi>V.</hi> In the Precept of sanctifying the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, we must distinguish between that, which is Ethical or Moral, and that which is Typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal or Ceremonial.</p>
                  <p>It was Ceremonial, 1. To sanctifie the seventh day precisely. 2. By this means to separate Jews from gentiles. But Moral, in that one day of seven must be sanctified for Gods service. Now the Church hath sanctified the first day, by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Christ, who hath sanctified it by his resurrection, and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rition, <hi>Ioh</hi> 20.19. and 26. By the example also of the Apostolical Church, <hi>Act</hi> 20. 7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.2. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.10.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. The form of Sanctifying this day consisteth in omission, and action.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII Things to be omitted, are the works of our outward and temporal callings.</p>
                  <p>These are opposite to the works of divine worship, in that six dayes we must labour.</p>

               <p>OF the mediate worship of God, of which we have now spoken in general, both the parts, and degrees are to be considered. The parts are two, The first is, of the Superiours du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty towards his Inferiours, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily: The later is, of every mans duty towards another.</p>
               <p>The duty of Inferiours to their Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, &amp; contrarily, is set down in the Fifth Precept; The sum whereof is, That between superiours and inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, that order may be kept, which is pleasing to God.</p>
               <p>This Command con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth of a Precept, &amp; a Promise. The precept is, <hi>Honour thy father &amp; thy mother.</hi> By the name of Parents, synecdochical<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly are meant all Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, as the word <hi>Honour</hi> contains all things that are like honour. The Promise is, <hi>That thou mayest live long in the land which the Lord thy God hath given thee.</hi> In this promise is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood both the condition of Gods will, and of our salvation: for oftentimes to the godly, God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenceth the short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of this life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with the happinesse of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The duties of inferiours to their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours, are reverence, obedience, and gratitude.</p>
               <p>Reverence is whereby we bestow upon our Superiours due honour; thinking well of them, speaking reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently to them, bearing with their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, and giving them the first place, and leave to speak, or do first.</p>

               <p>To Reverence is opposite Irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and contempt of Superiours.</p>

                  <p>Both sins are kinds of murther: for by too much rigour, and too much indulgence, we sin against the life of our neighbour. He hurts the good, that spares the evil.</p>

               <p>Thus of our duty toward the life of our neighbor. In the seventh Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept is set down, how we must preserve
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:46199:206"/>
our own, and neighbours Chastity; the sum whereof is, that the Heavenly law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver would have our own, and neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours chastity preserved inviolable.</p>
               <p>This precept is nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, <hi>Thou shalt not com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mit adultery</hi>; &amp; Synec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dochical also: for under the name of Adultery, all lust and intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is understood. Hence ariseth the affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative; that by endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring temperance we preserve our own and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers chastity.</p>
               <p>There be two-means to preserve cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stity; Temperance, and Wedlock: the first is en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>oyned to all men; the other to those that are called to Wedlock.</p>
               <p>Temperance is a vertue, moderating the affections of our mind, in pursuing and avoiding bodily pleasures.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tit. 2.11, 12, 13.</hi> The grace of God which bringeth salvation to all men, hath appeared; teaching us to deny un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godliness, and worldly lusts, &amp; that we should live soberly, justly and godly in this present world, looking for that b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>essed hope and glorious appearance of the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God, and of our, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Iesus Christ.</p>
               <p>To Temperance is opposite intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance &amp; insensibility, whereby honest and lawful delights are despised, also Hypocritical temperance is, of Monks and Eremites.</p>
               <p>Temperance is, both Sobriety and Chastity, as also Modesty and honesty: The former vertues have relation to us, the later to our neighbour.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="395" facs="tcp:46199:206"/>Sobriety is temperance from super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous meat, and drink.</p>
               <p>We must study to Sobriety, 1. Because of Gods command. 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the reason an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to it, taken from our calling, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5.8. <hi>But let us who are of the day, be sober.</hi> From the necessity of Prayer and from the end of the World, 1 Pet. 4.7. <hi>But, the end of all things is at hand, be yet therefore sober, and watch unto prayer.</hi> Lastly, from the snares of Satan, 1 Pet. 5.8. <hi>Be sober and watch, for your adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary the Devil walketh as a roaring Lion seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whom he may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To Sobriety is opposite Delicate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, whereby dainties, and delicacies are sought for immoderately in meat, and drink: Gluttony also, or Voracity, Drunkenesse, and hurtful Abstinence.</p>
               <p>Of dainties, <hi>Solomon</hi> speakes, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.1, 2.3 <hi>When thou sittest to eat with a Ruler, consider diligently what is before thee; and put a knife to thy throat, if thou be a man given to appitite: be not desirous of his dainties, for they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful meats.</hi> Gluttony and drunkenesse are to be avoided, 1. Because they are prohibited by God, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.20.31. <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.34. <hi>Rome</hi> 13.13. 2. Because the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects thereof are most pernicious, for they hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the meditating on Gods works, <hi>Isa.</hi> 5.19: and thinking upon Christs coming, <hi>Lu.</hi> 21 34. Prayers also, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.7. It stirs up anger and strife, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.1. and 29.30. It kindles lust, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.31, 32. It causeth scandal, as the examples of <hi>Noah</hi> sheweth, <hi>Ge.</hi> 9. and shut out of Gods kingdom, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.10. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.21. Hurtfull abstinence is,
<pb n="986" facs="tcp:46199:207"/>
when we refrain from meat and drink, to the prejudice of our health</p>
               <p>Neer to Sobriety is Vigilancie, when we abstain from untimely, and too much sleep, that we mae serve God with chearfulnesse, and follow the works of our vocations.</p>
               <p>1 Pet. 5.8 <hi>Be sober and watch.</hi> Now as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of Sobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, sonetime abstinence from pride and evil af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections is meant, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12 3. so oft times spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual vigilancie is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood as an abstinence from the sleep of secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, to which <hi>Peter</hi> hath respect in the place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove cited.</p>
               <p>To Vigilancie is opposite Sleepiness, and Monkish superstitious Watchings.</p>
               <p>Chastity, or Sanctimony so called, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.19. is temperance from lust.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We must follow chasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, 1. Because God com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mands it,</hi> Lev. <hi>19.2.</hi> Be ye holy for I the Lord your God am holy. <hi>1. Thess. 4.3</hi> This is the will of God, even your holinesse, that ye abstain from fornication. <hi>2.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they that follow it shall see God, <hi>Matth 5.8. Heb. 12.14.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To Chastity is opposite, both Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled chastity, as is that of them who are tyed with the vow of chastity, as also all impurity, as Fornication, Adultery, Whoredome Incest, Rapes, softnesse, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Therefore the marriage is not nullified because the Parents do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to it, unlesse the parties to be married be under yeares, or some other weighty causes do hinder: But if Parents have not sufficient caus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es either of hindring, or forcing the marriage, yet their consent must not therefore be sleigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; but Magistrates, Ministers, and Friends shall do well to put Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents in mind of their duty, that at least they may give their consent</p>

                  <p>The vertue; belonging to this precept,
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:46199:222"/>
are, the ordering of concupiscence, &amp; our wrestling against evil desires.</p>
                  <p>The ordering of concupiscence is, whereby our appetites and affections are so ruled, that by them we neither offend against our selves, nor against our neighbour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>1 Thess. 5.23.</hi> Now the God of peace, sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie you throughout, &amp;c,</p>
                  <p>To this is opposite inordinate concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence, which in Scripture by way of excellency is called Concupiscence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rom. 7.7.</hi> For I had not known concupiscence, if the Law had not said Thou shalt not lust.</p>
                  <p>The parts of this ordering are two; The one is imployed about the appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tits, the other about the affections.</p>
                  <p>This word <hi>concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scence,</hi> among Divines is taken in a large sence, both for the appetites and affections; of which the former are ascribed to man, as he is a sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive creature, but the latter, as he is a man, But by Philosophers it is taken more strictly; so that they reduce the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior appetites to the concupiscible faculty, but the affections to the irascible.</p>
                  <p>Ordered appetites are, whereby man desires meat, drink, rest, sleep and such like, moderately, and to the end appointed by God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>1 Tim. 5.23.</hi> Drink no longer water but use a little wine for thy sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macks sake and often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities.</p>

whereby more is desired than na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or Gods ordination do require, or for another end than that, to which God hath ordained natural things lawful.</p>

                  <p>The cheif affections, are, Love, Hatred Joy, Sadnesse, Hope, Fear, and Anger.</p>
                  <p>Ordered Love, is, whereby we sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely love our neighbour, and desire the thinges that be good, fair and of good report.</p>
