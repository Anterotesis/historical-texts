            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

ACCOUNT
Of a Horrid and

COMMITTED
On the Body of a Young Perſon ſuppoſed to be of a good Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in the Fields beyond Whitechappel-Church, in the Pariſh of
Stepny commonly known by the Name of Tom-turds Field
where ſhe was found, on Munday the 16th. of March, her
Throat Cut, and ſeveral wounds upon her Body, which was
there left ſtark Naked in one of the Pits belonging to the Field.</head>
            <p>DId we not by the too often repeated Inſtances
of this kind behold the Barbarity of Man's
Temper, when left of God Almighty, we
ſhould be more Aſtoniſh'd at the Bloudy and Savage
Cruelty in the following Relation, which is enough
to draw Tears from the Eyes of the moſt Unconcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and raiſe Pity in the Breaſt of the worſt of Men:
But not to detain the Reader with too long Exordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums,
I ſhall proceed to the Story it ſelf:</p>
            <p>In the Fields beyond <hi>White-Chappel</hi> Church, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
called <hi>Tom-turds</hi> Fields, ſome Children were
on <hi>Munday</hi> the <hi>16th</hi> of this Inſtant playing near the
Pits, and one of them caſually ſtriking his Ball there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into,
the Lad endeavouring to reach the ſame with a
Stick lit upon a Foot as he concieved it, and ſo it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
true, of a Perſon that had been there Murdered;
whereat calling his Companions they came about it,
and the Croud increaſing, they quickly pull'd the
Carkaſs to the ſide of the Pit, and by that means per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
it was the Body of a Young Woman ſtrip'd
ſtark Naked, except the Lyning of an old-Gown to
<pb facs="tcp:40095:2"/>
Cover her, and on her Right Leg a Mans Stocking
and Shoe; ſhe was Bruiſed all over her Body, and
had ſeveral Wounds which were ſeen thereupon; to
wit, one in her Right Breaſt, another upon the ſide
or her Right Eye, and another in her Throat, which
was cut half through, with ſeveral other Barbarous
Gaſhes in ſeveral parts of the Body, The Perſon is as
yet unknown, but by the Conjectures of moſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
that have viewed her, ſhe is ſuppoſed to be of
ſome Quality, and the rather for that ſhe hath a very
Clear <hi>Skin</hi> and ſoft Hand; ſhe ſeems to have ſeveral
good Features, and is as ſuppoſed not above the Age
of 16 or 17 at moſt: on her little Finger of the Right
Hand ſhe had a <hi>Cornelion Ring,</hi> but how long ſhe hath
lain in that Place is not yet known, tho it cannot be
very long, for that her Wounds are freſh.</p>
            <p>And upon the removing her from the Pit where ſhe was firſt
found, to <hi>Mile-end-Green</hi> at the ſign of the <hi>George,</hi> where her
Body now lies, ſhe Bled a freſh: The Field where ſhe was, hath
been always looked upon as very Dangerous for Paſſingers, after
Night is ſhut in, and ſeveral Perſons have been there Robb'd, but
the Barbarity of this is hardly to be Parralleled, not only in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to her Sex, but alſo her Youth; And how Malice: it ſelf
ſhould be ſo Trancendently wicked in the perpetration of ſo Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
and Abominable a Murder, it can ſcarce enter into the Breaſt of
Humanity to Imagine: Murder in any degree hath been always lookt
upon as the moſt Crying of all Sins, and ſeldome is it that the ſame
ſcapes Unpunniſhed, the Vengeance of the Almighty purſuing the
Criminal generally to hss Punniſhment even in this World, much
more may we hope that in ſo Horrid an Inſtance as this is, where
neither Beauty nor Youth could work Compaſſion on the obdurate
and Cruel Hearts of Accurſed Perpetrators thereof, that in God's
good time the ſame will come to a Diſcovery, and the Criminals
to their deſerved End: Which that the ſame may come to paſs,
is the Prayers of all good People, who cannot but upon ſight
thereof compaſſionate the poor Innocent, and look upon the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
of this Tragedy with more than common Deteſtation.</p>
