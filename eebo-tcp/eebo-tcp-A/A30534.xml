         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>From the Elect and gathered Assembly of the
chosen people in the Nation of England, called
in derision, and known amongst all false
Sects by the name of QUAKERS; and
by a Servant of the great God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and Earth, and a Member of that
people, this is written.</head>
            <div type="part">
               <head>To the Pope (Chief Bishop) and his Cardidals at
Rome, and to his Bishops, Iesuits, and Priests
there, and else-where, thorough the Dominions
of the Romish Church, scattered abread in the
Nations.</head>
               <p>WHereas we a poor, despised, and rejected peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
among the Nations of the earth, yet
dreadful and mightie, because the Majestie
and Presence of the Lord God is with us, who
hath called us, and chosen us, and gathered us, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
us from among men, out of kindreds, and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes,
and peoples, into one body, and one spirit, out of
all the Sects upon the earth; and we are of one mind,
and one soul, having fellowship with the Son, and with
the Father, being come through great tribulations, and
many fierie trials, and are refined, and purified, and
made clean and white in the bloud of the Lamb, being
fully recovered out of the great deluge of darknesse, and
Apostacie, which hath overflown and drowned the whole
world, and all nations, since the daies of the true
Churches, and holy Apostles: And know ye, that we are
none of all the many Sects, nor of the divers waies, and
formal worshippers, that are but in the imitations fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
of what the Saints of old spoke and performed, in the
Power and Spirit of God, which hath been spoken and
practised by all the divers Sects and false Churches, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:29643:3"/>
the Spirit, Power, and Life, that was in the Apostles;
so that all Religion hath been, and the profession and
practise thereof, for many Ages, but as the floating of a
broken vessel upon the waters, driven with the several
winds, wanting Anchor, and skilful Mariners, which
hath not carried to perfect Rest, the hope of Eternal life:
But know ye, that now at last, through our long and
wearied travels, and after all our tedious seekings, and
our zealous practises and profession in Christianitie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by us, while darkness covered us, and the earth;
hath the Lord set us safe upon the Rock Christ Jesus, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
whom the Church of Christ firmly standeth, and the
gates of hell cannot prevail against; and he hath made
our habitation sure upon the Mountain of his house,
which is established upon the top of all mountains, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
we now are gathered, and rest in a certain hope
and tried confidence, and doth view the whole world,
and the state of all mankind, and measureth the times
and seasons thoroughout Generations; and the state of
the Church we perfectly know, by the inspiration of the
Almightie, her estate before the Apostles daies, and in the
Apostles daies, and since the Apostles daies, and her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease,
and decrease, and estate, since the beginning of
the world till now, and at this present time, to us is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainlie
known, by the Spirit of Jesus, and the light of the
Lamb, which now is risen upon our Mountain, and shines
in our habitations: And first we certifie you, as for the
many false Sects and Churches (so called) and many of
the divers worshippers, and separated forms of Churches,
risen up since the Apostles daies, from the least of them to
the greatest, we have searched and examined, and are not
fully satisfied (but rather the contrarie) that they are
perfectly sound in the Faith, but rather degenerated,
from the Power, Spirit, and Life that was in the Apostles,
and among the true Churches before the Apostacie; and
we have sought out their first original and root, and we
find they fall short of the true Church and the Apostles;
first in respect of time, many Generations; and also in
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:29643:3"/>
respect of life, and power, and puritie, and they want
the spirit, and dominion, and government, that the true
Churches and Apostles possessed; and we certainly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
they are many of them come up, and risen in a dark
night, long since the daies of the Apostles, while the Sun
was yet unrisen, and while the mountains of ignorance,
blindnesse, and wickedness covered the face of the earth,
and the clouds of darknesse remained upon the face of
the whole heavens: and while yet the man-child re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
in God, being caught up to him, and the woman
lodged in the desolate wildernesse, being thither fled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the great red Dragon: And we believe not, that
any of them are the Lambs Wife, lawfully joyned to
him, neither are they the Virgin, in which there is no
spot; nor the Spouse, truly in election to Christ the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom;
for we have had controversie with them this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
years, and weighed them, and measured them in the
ballance of equitie, and they appear to us, not to be of a
true descent from that Vine, into which the true Church
was planted; but their original may be of a latter race:
And to say no more of them, we certainly know they are
foully spotted, and hath not the favour, nor parts, nor
garments of a Virgin; and Christ the Bridegroom they
have deeply wronged, for many false Sects have risen out
of the great Whore, the mother of Harlots, who hath
been in open and secret fornication, every since the daies
of the Apostles, and such are her off-spring, and not of
the true Seed, elect, which is heir by right, of the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of life eternal, the Kingdom which hath no end.</p>
               <p>And for as much as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath openly
pleaded, as we have heard, and some of your Members
also to our faces, that she is indeed the true Church, and
she alone, and none besides, and that you can fetch your
original by line truly from the Apostles, and Church of
the Saints, and are not degenerated in any particular of
Faith, Doctrine, nor Practise, from the Life, and Power,
and Government, and Spirit which was among the true
Church, and in the Apostles: These things, with others
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:29643:4"/>
the like, have we heard of you, and concerning you, by
many: And now, because the Lord hath put it into our
hearts, to have controversie with you, and to seek out
perfectly your original, and to justifie you, or condemn
you accordingly; and having the certain infallible Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of the Lord God to try all things, we are purposed in
the Lord to visit you, and to examine to the foundation
your rise; and first beginning from whence you come
by descent, and what you truly are in your present e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state,
and whether you be indeed the true Church, and
have the true Spirit, or whether you are otherwise, that
all the world may be satisfied, and more perfectly know
the full truth concerning the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and your
seed and root we will examine, and your birth and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal
we will search out, and your faith, and worship,
and whole Religion we will lay to the line of true judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to justifie you, or condemn you eternally; for the
Saints shall judge the world, and your garments shall be
stripped off, and your secrets discovered, and your whole
body and members made fully manifest, that the very
truth of all things may appear, and be imbraced, and the
whoredomes of all the earth may be laid open, that the
Just and the Innocent, that hath long laid groaning in
great captivity, may be delivered from under all bonds
of oppressions, whoredoms, and iniquities; and this will
the eternal God by us speedily bring to passse amongst you.</p>
               <p>Wherefore thou Pope, greatly admired, and highly
exalted, and to all thy Cardinals, Friers, Jesuits, and
Priests, and all other Officers under thee, I am moved of
the Lord God of heaven and earth, (who is the only
Holiness, and highest of all) by this Message to visit you,
requiring you, and charging you, in the Name and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
of the Dreadful and Mightie God, before whom
all men and Nations are as nothing in comparison, but
may be turned at his pleasure, &amp; dashed to pieces by his
mightie hand, and unto whom all the sons of <hi>Adam</hi> in all
the world, must render an account; &amp; as you will answer
it to him in his dreadful day of judgement &amp; vengeance,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:29643:4"/>
and as you love and will obey your God and Christ,
whom you professe and serve; and as you would honour
your God, and bring people to your way, and worship,
and religion, upon these ingagements, and by the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
of the Almightie, I lay it upon you to answer, and
to return your knowledge and opinions to the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
following, which I am moved to querie and demand
of you, that your doctrines, practises, and worships, and
whole religion, in every part thereof, may be veiwed,
and examined, and measured, according to the Saints
and Apostles writings, and may thereby be cleared, or
otherwise reproved and condemned: And if your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
and practises in religion be sprung from the true
grounds, and true Spirit and your Church be indeed the
true Church, that can prove her pedigree truly descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the Church of Christ, before the Apostacie, and
clear her felf from all degeneration in every degree, and
that she is perfect in the faith, and worship, and practises
of the holy Church and Apostles of old; then shall all
that love God, and fear him, and hopes for life eternal,
separate themselves from all Sects, and Apostates, sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
from you, and come in, and return again to you, as
to a faithful Mother, and joyn with you in all things;
and adde themselves to your church only, and renounce
and denie all the contrarie, that is not of you; and so
shall your names and honour be increased through all
the earth. But and if after lawful trial, and just exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,
and searching out the matter, it be proved
against you, that our are degenerated from what the
true Church and Apostles were, and are not builded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Christ the true Rock and foundation, but diverted
from the Power, Life, and Spirit, and true Religion
which the Apostles were in; and that your church is not
the true church, but a false Sect, and your original can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be fetch'd from the Apostles, but is of a latter and
more corrupted race; then shall you denie all your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and church, and renounce your profession and
practises, and come to them, and joyn with them, that
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:29643:5"/>
can prove their church to be the true Church, and can
fetch their original from the Spirit of the Apostles, and
that is builded upon Christ the everlasting foundation
(whoever this shall be proved to be) wherefore appear
and come forth to trial, upon this condition, joyn issue
with us, and answer these things in plainnesse, and let us
know your Judgements, that a return you may receive.</p>
               <p>First, Whether you are indeed the only true Church
of Christ, his body, of his flesh, and of his bones, called,
and gathered, and united by the eternal Spirit of Jesus,
perfect in the Faith of Christ, perfect in Doctrine, and
perfect in Worship, as were the Churches of Christ in
the daies of the Apostles? and whether the eternal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
dwell in every particular member of your church,
and do lead each one of you into all truth, insomuch
that you need now no man to teach any one of you, but
as that same spirit that dwels in you? answer me plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
yea, or nay.</p>
               <p>2. Whether are you not in any particular of your
faith, doctrines, practises, and worships, in any degree de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated,
nor deviated from what the faith, doctrine,
practise &amp; worship were that the true Church were in in
the daies of the Apostles? and whether will you admit of
trial in all things you profess and practise, by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
the writings of the Saints, yea, or nay?</p>
               <p>3. Whether your church of <hi>Rome</hi> do receive the pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
down of the Spirit upon sons and daughters imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately,
and every member receive the holy Ghost, and
is filled therewith, and baptized therewith, as in the true
church? <hi>Acts</hi> 2. and whether you have received the holy
Ghost, and everlasting Comforter immediately, as did
the true church in the daies of the Apostles? Answer me
these things in the truth of your hearts, that you may
be owned or denied.</p>
               <p>4. Whether the faith you profess have perfectly puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
your hearts from all sin, and hath given you victorie

this condition to be attainable in this life upon earth,
and to be injoyed and waited for, yea or nay?</p>
               <p>5. What is your ground of sprinkling Infants with
water, and whether he that first instituted it had the gift
of the eternal Spirit, and was led thereby? for we know
it was first ordained at <hi>Rome</hi> in your church, and all the
<hi>Protestants</hi> received it from you, who are not able to give
us a sufficient reason thereof; but we are not satisfied
therein, therefore tell us, whether are people thereby
made members of the bodie of Christ, and baptized into
his true Church? and is it a perfect seal and sign of the
new birth, and regeneration, as is professed? and doth
that give all children that are sprinkled a right to the
Kingdom of God, and to be members of the Church of
Christ? and satisfie us plainly, is the sprinkling of an
Infant (never having heard of Gospel, but while uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
and unchanged in nature) the true baptism into
the true Faith of Christ, as it is professed? Answer me
plainly, yea or nay.</p>
               <p>6. Whether the bodie and bloud of Christ, that is
meat indeed, and drink indeed, be carnal and visible
things, to be seen, felt, and known visiblie and carnallie?
and whether bread and wine, (that is mortall, and will
corrupt,) be the very body and the very bloud of Christ
Jesus? and whether Christ hath any other bodie and
bloud, to be known in any other way or manner then
what is professed to be visiblie and carnallie known by
you? and is that bread after consecration the verie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
Image of the Father, and was with the Father be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the world began? else it is not the bodie of Christ,
answer me plainlie.</p>
               <p>7. Again, we are not satisfied concerning your burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and torturing, and imprisoning, in cruel Iquisitions,
and Goals, such as dissenteth from you, and cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
in your church, which ye call hereticks; whether is
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:29643:6"/>
not this done by your church, or any member thereof?
and do you justisie the doing of it by the authoritie of
your church? and we demand of you to give us example
for such practises in Scripture, ever practised by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
or true Church, or any member thereof, to burn,
or kill, or imprison such as would not own them, and
were hereticks? otherwise we must condemn it, and judge
you eternally for it; and whether such practises done
at <hi>Rome</hi> and in her dominions, be not murder, and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie,
and tyrannie, and shedding of innocent bloud, and
of the devil the wicked one? answer me plainly, and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
us herein, that we may know how to deal with you
in controversie.</p>
               <p>8. Again, we are not satisfied concerning the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of Images of the Saints, set up, and bowed to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
you, and your praying before them, and to the
Saints, and by beads, and in set forms, such things you
practise; and also your keeping and setting apart the
Saints daies, and your holy daies, and eating with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to daies, denying of flesh such and such daies, and
observing of daies, and meats, and drinks, and fasting in
your own wils, and your Nunneries, and keeping men
and women one from another in secret houses; whether
are these things commanded and required of the Lord
from you? and we charge you to give us some example,
that ever the true Church practised such things? other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
if you do not, nor cannot prove these your practises
from the Scriptures, and example of the Apostles before
you, we must deny you, and condemn your practises for
ever, and cannot believe, that your church is the true
church, nor you lawful successors of the holy Apostles.</p>
               <p>9. What you believe concerning the reign and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of Christ and his coming? is he, his reign and
government visible, and of this world, or invisible, and
from heaven? and whether liars, whoremongers, adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers,
drunkards, man-slayers, and contentious men, or
any that lives in any sin or transgression, in the first na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
be of the kingdome and government of Jesus, or
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:29643:6"/>
hath any part or portion therein in time to come for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver?
and how may such ever have part therein, and give
us your knowledge in these things; and also what you
hold and profess concerning Election and Reprobation,
that we may know whether your knowledge and faith
be sound and perfect in these things, and to be imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
or condemned and denied.</p>
               <p>10. What is the Man-child that hath been caught up
to God? and what is the reason of his being caught up?
and what is the Woman that fled into the wildernesse?
and what is the cause of her so flying? and when is the
the time (is it come, or to come, that the Man-child hath
been caught up, &amp; the woman fled, &amp; that the man-child
shall come down again, &amp; the Woman again return? and
what is that Beast the first and the second, and is his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
come, or yet to come, who reigned over the Kings
of the earth, and caused all both small and great to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
him, and killed the Saints, and overcome them, that
would not worship him, and made war against the Lamb,
and persecuted the Womans seed? and when is it that the
world wondered after the Beast, is it come, or to come?
answer these things in plainness, we demand of you.</p>
               <p>11. What and who is that great Whore that sits upon
many waters, with whom the Kings of the earth commits
fornications, and who hath made Nations drunk with
the wine of her fornications, and who hath reigned over
the Kings and dominions of the earth? and is that Whore
come, or yet to come? and whether is your church every
whit free from the fornications of that Whore? and will
you admit of lawful trial by your fruits and works, and
suffer judgement accordinglie? and whether the whole
church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or any part of her dominions, be the
multitudes, peoples, and nations, and tongues, the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
or which the Whore sits? and whether your church
be whollie free from that Woman, which have drunk the
bloud of Saints, and of the Martyrs of Jesus? and shew us
plainlie who that Whore is, if you can, and what is her
flesh, and the fire that must burn it?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:29643:7"/>
12. Whether are the false prophets and deceivers come,
or to come, which Christ said should come? if you say,
they are come, when did they come? and who are they?
and how may they be known? and what was their first
original? and out of what doth all false prophets and
false prophecies come? is the church of <hi>Rome</hi> clear of all
the false prophets? and whether is your ministrie in the
verie same power, spirit, and authoritie which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
were in? is its call and ordination the verie same?
is its maintenance and practice the verie same? and its
fruits, effects, and end the verie same, or some other? let
us know from you, that we may lay you to the line of true
judgement, for all people and nations to behold.</p>
               <p>And come friends, let us reason a little with you fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
we are not satisfied, that the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> is true
and lawful successor of the Apostle <hi>Peter;</hi> had <hi>Peter</hi> a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
crown, and did Kings bow and kneel to him? and had
<hi>Peter</hi> such large revenues and money out of the Nations
as the Pope Hath? did <hi>Peter</hi> sell pardons for money, or
did any buy religion of him? and did <hi>Peter</hi> at all rule
over mens consciences? and was <hi>Peter</hi> named holinesse?
we demand of you to prove rightlie and trulie, that the
Pope doth succeed <hi>Peter</hi> in the same Spirit, in the same
power, and in the same conversation: and that his call
to oversee the church be justlie the same as <hi>Peters</hi> was, and
that he execute it perfectlie as <hi>Peter</hi> did: Also answer us
plainlie, what is the seed of the Woman, and what is the
head of the Serpent? and is his head bruised yea or nay?
and what is the Devil, and what is his beginning, and
what is the kingdom that he is Ruler of? and how is his
kingdom to be destroyed? and what is the flesh of Christ,
and his bloud, which was before <hi>Abraham?</hi> and how is
Christ made under the Law? answer me these things:
And what is the death that hath reigned over all? and
what is the power thereof and what is the fruits of that
death? and when must that death be destroyed? and is it
destroyed among you? and what was man in his creation
of the dust of the ground? and what was he that was the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:29643:7"/>
verie Image of God male and female, before <hi>Adam</hi> was
formed of the dust of the ground, or <hi>Eve</hi> taken out of
him? declare these things plainlie if you can and what is
the first transgression &amp; the curse? &amp; whether any can be
made free from the curse upon the earth, yea or nay? and
what is the Kingdom of heaven that is like a little leaven,
and that is like a net cast into the sea? and what is that
which must be leavened? and what is that good fish that
must be gathered into vessels, &amp; that bad that must be
cast away? &amp; how doth the Kingdom of heaven bring the
bad out of the waters to the shore? and why is it, and
wherefore, and what is the reason, that none can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Kingdom of God, nor see it, but such as are born
again? and how is a man born again? and what is that
mothers womb, that <hi>Iob</hi> &amp; all mankind came out of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
and that must return thither again naked? and what
are the the fig-leaves that hath covered in transgression?
and what is the covering of the Spirit? and what must be
covered, and what not? and why is it, and how comes it
to passe, that one and the same thing is sin, &amp; wickedness
acted by one and the same thing, good and just acted by
another? These things answer to us plainlie, &amp; also prove
all your practises and profession by plain Scripture, and
give us example from <hi>Peter</hi> and the true Churches, that
he and they practised the same things which the Pope
and you do, if you would have any to own you, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
if you do not, or cannot satisfie all people in these
particulars by the Scriptures, then forsake your Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and renounce your Church, and confess your selves
to be deceivers of the world, and to be deceived, for God
will tear your garments, and marre your beautie, and
stain your crowns, and uncover your nakedness, and
subdue your power, and slay your strength, and pull
down your strong holds, and the dread of the Almightie
will come over you.</p>
               <p>And come friends, answer me, is the light by which
you walk everlasting? and is the day dawned, and the
Sun risen, that never goeth down? and have you seen the
signs of the coming of the Son of man and what are the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:29643:8"/>
signs of his coming? and what is that Sun that must be
turned into darkness? and what is that Moon that must
be turned into bloud? and what are the keepers of the
house that must tremble; and do you own quaking and
trembling at the Word of the Lord? and did you ever
quake and tremble, or is there such a thing in your
church? and what is that part in man that must tremble?
is it not that part in man that the devil enters into?
answer these things: and what is that mother of har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots?
and where is she that hath been drunk with the
bloud of the Saints? and what is the mysterie of her, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
it if you can? and what is her garments? and who
are her children? and of what nature are they? and how
may they be known? and come friends answer us, have
you seen God face to face, as did <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Abraham?</hi> and
have you seen his Shape perfectlie? give us a description
of him if you have: and doth not all those that be of
the seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> hear Gods voice, and see his shape?
and are any of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but who are come out of the
world, and have denied it, and bares the daily crosse of
Christ, which mortifies to the world? and doth your
wooden crosses, and stone crosses, in your towns, &amp; high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies,
&amp; in your houses, &amp; crucifixes in your breasts, cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie
you to the world, and mortifie you? or are you not
such as have the form of a crosse of Christ, but wants the
power? and what is the difference between all your Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
and the Images the Prophets declared against? and
what life is there in the Image of <hi>Christ</hi> or <hi>Mary,</hi> painted
or graven in wood or stone? are your soules refreshed
thereby? and is not that all the unitie you have with
Christ? and is that unitie and fellowship you have with
Christ, the same that they had; that had unitie and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship
with the Father, and with the Son? and have you
unitie with the Son, and with the Father, as the true
Church had? tell us plainlie; and what is Antichrist? and
where is his reigning at this day? and what is his marks
and signs? and what is the marks of the Beast, that every
one received in their foreheads, and in their hands? and
what is his power, by which he causeth every one to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:29643:8"/>
him? and is the church of <hi>Rome</hi> whollie free from
that, from causing and compelling people to be of your
Religion, and come to your worship by your fire and fag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots,
and inquisitions? make it us plain that this is not
the beasts power, for we have a jealousie, at least, it is not
the power of God, that was among the Apostles; and
why do you kill creatures? did Christ or the Apostles kill
creatures that were not of their Religion? doth not this
shew that you want the Power and Spirit of God among
you, and the spiritual weapon that beats down the strong
holds? we cannot believe that you have the spiritual wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons,
which the Apostles had, except you make it appear
to us; and can any be converted to the true Church,
but by the immediate work and Spirit of God? and they
that have that, need not be ashamed; but then why are
some of your ministers creeping up and down the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in holes, and dare not be seen, but lies many years
together undiscovered, not daring to preach their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
and discover their minds? did ever the Apostles thus?
and is not this a sign that they have not the power of
God to carry them through, but runs into holes and
corners for fear of their lives? is this the way of the true
Ministers of Christ? and what is the Lambs Wife? and
what is her adorning, and her beautie? and are you the
Lambs Wife, and are married to him for ever? hath every
member of your church the witness thereof? and answer
us, doth natural learning make a Minister of Christ, or
was the Apostles made Ministers thereby? and can a man
learn the Ministrie naturally, as he learns a trade? and is
the preaching of the Gospel a trade? or is it not the gift
of God? and can it be bought and sold? and what is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
life? and how is it received? and hath any that hope
but them whose hearts are purified? and must not everie
ones heart be purified before they see God, who is pure?
and how comes man to be a Reprobate? and how comes
man to be a Son of God again? and what is the way and
meanes of life eternal? is it carnal and visible things, and
Ordinances? is it the doing and performing of something
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:29643:9"/>
by the creature, or by the revelation of something in the
creature? and must not Christ be revealed in every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular?
and is not that the true bread of life? and is there
any other bread that is eternal, but Christ, which the
mortal eye cannot see? and we are very doubtful, that
bread and wine after consecration, is not the very bodie
and bloud of Christ; and except you can prove to us by
plain Scripture, and give us sound reasons to demonstrate
things, we must judge you, and shew your folly to the
whole world: and why do you pray for the dead, is that
available? shall not they receive according to their works
that they have done? give us example, that ever the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
did so, or else we will say, you are blind and in the
dark: and tell us plainly, what error is, and what
schism is? and what is the eye that the god of the world
hath blinded? and what is the eye that sees God, is it
mortal or eternal? Answer us these things in plainnesse,
that we may know how to return in controversie with
you, for the Lord God is risen, that will break in pieces
and confound all the world.</p>
               <p>And come friends, give us your answer, are you of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>brahams</hi>
seed, that was the friend of God, that had not a
foot of ground, but forsook his place and kindred? are
you of that birth that hath no father upon earth? and are
you heirs of Gods promise? and have you made your
calling and election sure? aud is the seed come out of
<hi>Egypts</hi> bonds? and is all <hi>Egypts</hi> bonds broken yet? and
what is the bondage of <hi>Egypt?</hi> and was not transgression
the reason of it? and what is <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> out of what root did
he spring, and whose seed is he? and is not the hard heart
of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> killers and murderers? are not such of <hi>Pharaoh?</hi>
and tell us plainly, are you redeemed from <hi>Pharaoh?</hi> or
you are such as oppresseth the seed as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did? and
tell us, who was the inventer of all your Images, and who
was the former of all your graven Images? are not they
all invented and come up since the Apostles daies, which
ye have set up? and what is Purgatorie? and from what
had it its rise and original? and what ground have you
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:29643:9"/>
out of Scripture for such a doctrine? and what is the rule
of faith? and what is faith? and what doth it give victorie
over? and what doth it overcome? and what is the vail
that hath been spread over all Nations? and what is the
Mountain of the house of God? and what are those

and what are those mountains that people expect
salvation from in vain? and did not <hi>Iohn</hi> come to throw
down the mountains? and what are the mountains that
he came to throw down? and what is the valley he came
to raise up? answer us, and what is the sword of the Spirit?
and whether have ye the sword of the Spirit, and the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Armor? and what, is your church defended and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
by spiritual weapons, or carnal? is not your goals
carnal weapons, and your inquisitions, and your killing
people about Religion, are not all these carnal weapons?
and had ever the Church of Christ such weapons? an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
me plainlie; and do you not expect the Lord will
suddenlie plead with you? and are not ye them that put
off the day of the Lord, and causeth the seat of violence
to come neer? and are not ye them that have eyes but see
not, ears and hear not, hearts and understand not? and
is not your eye blind, that should see Gods presence, and
your ears stopped that should hear his voyce? and have
you heard his voice, and seen his shape? if you have, what
is he like? answer us; and what is his Word, and where
doth it dwell in your hearts, or is it without you? and
can any thing without you purifie you, and take away
sin out of your hearts? and must not Christ be within?
and what is the fruits, and signs, and marks of a Saint?
and why do you go pilgrims to visit dead bones, what is
the reason of it, and who was the first that instituted it?
and what is the meaning of your holy water? give us
Scripture for all these practises, or else the power of the
Lord will tear you to pieces, and lay open your founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and none that love God can joyn unto you; and
can any of you pardon sin trulie, that it shall never more
be remembred? and is not your sins remembred with the

light in your consciences some time? and is there not a
light in your consciences that doth convince you? tell
me plainlie; and whether do you own that Christ hath
lightened everie one that comes into the world? and
what is the light? and do you know Christ as he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Abraham?</hi> and have you seen his day as <hi>Abraham</hi> did?
and what is the day of Christ, doth the carnal eye see it?
give us your knowledge and your judgement in all these
things, and lay down your principles at full, and prove
by the Scriptures what you hold and profess, if you
would have any to turn to your Religion, otherwise re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
your church, and come out of <hi>Babylon:</hi> what is
<hi>Babylon,</hi> and the Mother of Harlots? and what is spiritual
<hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Sodom</hi> where Christ is crucified? and what is
the Whore? and what is her flesh, that hath stained the
earth? and what is the fire that must consume her flesh?
manie are jealous concerning you, that you are not the
true Church, but that you have drunken of the Whores
cup, who hath made all Nations drunk: and if that time
be come, that she have made all Nations drunk, then how
can you clear your selves, being nations and multitudes
of people? To all these things I expect your speedie an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer:
and what is the death that hath raigned over all?
and how is man recovered out of it, and when? and
what is the gates of hell? and what is the Rock that they
cannot prevail against? and whether your church may
never be prevailed against? and whether it be not your
inquisitions, stakes, and faggots, and killing people, that
doth principally defend your church? and if you should
cease your inquisitions, and killing those you call Heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
whether would not you be prevailed against by
many other Sects? lay away your persecution of people
that you call Heriticks, and do not deal with them after
the manner which you have done, by inquisitions and
such like, and onlie by sound arguments, and the power
of the Spirit, defend your religion. And dare you suffer
a certain number of us to come among you and preach
what we hold, and a certain number of you shall freelie
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:29643:10"/>
come among us, and freelie preach what you hold, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
persecution or anie violence, as we would expect
and have the same from you, engage man for man with
us, and do no otherwise deal with ours, then we deal
with yours; and take the free libertie to deal with our
men as we deal with your men, but no otherwise, and
let each of the messengers preach and hold forth what
they would have, and what they reallie hold and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
and convert the most either of them can to their
own Religion, and then let all the world see which hath
the Power and Spirit of God with them, and whether
your Ministers or our Ministers do turn the more people
from you to us, or from us to you; and send your answer,
whether you will agree to the premises: and if you do,
send your Messengers when you please, and we will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
in the Lord, their persons shall not be harmed; but
if they were, then take man for man, life for life, of our
men sent to you, and let that God be the true God, that
appears in most power and authoritie; and let him be
worshipped for ever, whose power converts the most to
the knowledge of him out of wickedness, and let that
Church be the true Church, which cannot be overcome;
and as you are willing to be made manifest, join issue
with us in this business, and propound your own time
when the men shall return, whether the continuance of
the matter be for daies, months, or years, and let each of
the men return without harm of person; and this will
be a way trulie to trie and make manifest all things, to all
the world, and whether you or we be in the right way,
&amp; of the right Church; &amp; use you no weapon against us,
but the soundest arguments you can, by words accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Scriptures, and the same weapons we will use
against you, and no other, but the authoritie of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God, and arguments thereby, which shall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Scriptures, the Apostles writings, and the
testimonie of the true Church; and hereby in the sight
of the whole world, let your church, and faith, and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
and practises, and worships be tried, and our
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:29643:11"/>
church, faith, doctrines, and worships, and practises, and
whether it be yours or ours that do overcome, or are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome,
let that deside the controversie; and whether
it be you or we that are soonest overcome, and that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
the one against the other in this trial, and in these
proceedings; and that which is overcome and prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
against, is not the true Church, against which nothing
can prevail, no not the gates of hell; and whether your
Church or ours cannot be prevailed against by the other,
let that be the true Church, for that which is prevailed
against is not the true Church, and whether it be your or
we that are elected, and of the election, which cannot be
deceived; if we be not elected, and you deceivers, then
it is possible you may deceive us, but if we prove that we
be in the election, then you cannot deceive us; and if
we be in the truth, and of the true Church, then it will
be happiness for you to be converted and turned to us;
come to the trial as soon as you will, and if you be in the
election you need not be afraid to be deceived by any,
for the elect cannot be deceived, whoever that be, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
your Church or our Church be the true Church,
and in the election; and if your Ministers among us do
preach the same things, and by the same spirit, and hold
forth the verie same faith, principles, worship, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises,
which we do, and are of, and it be proved they are
of the same spirit and principles we are of, agreeing in
all things, then we will own them to be Christs Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters;
and if our Ministers among you do hold forth that
true faith, and principles, and practises, and worship, and
by the same spirit as Christ and his Apostles did, and
prove what they say by the Scriptures, then shall you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
them as the Ministers of Christ, and renounce all
that you hold and profess, contrarie to what they hold
and preach among you, and hereby things may come to
a fair triall, and the naked truth may be made manifest,
whether your Church or our Church be the true Church
of Christ, trulie descended from the Church of the
Saints of old, and whether your Ministers or our Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:29643:11"/>
be the lawful successors of the Apostles; and we
would willinglie come to deal with you upon these

               <p>THou mountain, hear the Word of the Lord God;
thus saith the Lord God unto thee, I will lay thee
low, I will break thee down, I will stain the glorie of all
flesh, my sword shall enter into the heart of my enemies,
I will slay the wicked, and I will crush the head of the
ungodlie, and I will grind the hard hearts unto pieces,
I will come in a day unexpected, I am at the door, behold
me, and I will take vengeance without pitie upon all my
enemies, my hand shall not spare, my eye shall not pitie,
but I will tear and rend, and give unto thee, and unto all
mankind, the fruit of your own doings: Innocent bloud
cries unto me, that hath been unjustlie shed, and the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
soul groans under the Altar unto me, and now I
am risen, and I am begun to work in the earth, and I will
goe through nations, and tread them down, under my
power; I have raised a seed which shall thresh the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
and my word is gone forth out of my mouth, which
shall beat them to dust; and my power shall knock at
thy gates, and break down thy strength, and it shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
against thee: Oh thou mountain, whose seat is high,
and whose power is great, and who hath been able to
make war with thee? thou hast swallowed up the poor
and needie, and thou hast eaten up the innocent as the
exe eateth up grasse, thou hast continued for ages, and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:29643:12"/>
thou accounts thy self the most ancient, and thou hath
been without fear of any man, and thou hast not regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the honour of my name, but exalted thy self altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
But now, saith the Lord, the dread of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
shall come upon thee, and the Majestie of the Lord of
hosts shall appear terrible unto thee, and thou shalt know
there is a God that can do whatsoever he will, and he
will wound the mightie men, and none shall heal them;
and he will vex all his enemies in his displeasure, and he
will break them, and none shall bind them up; thy glorie,
and the glorie of the whole earth, is as grass before the
mower, and as the flower of the field that is soon wither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and thy treasure, and the treasure of all Nations, is
of no respect unto him, and strength of the whole earth
is weakness before him, and the crowns of Princes he
accounteth as the dust, he treads over it all, and his ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
arme reacheth beyond it all, and he is awakened,
that will strike thorough kingdoms, and that will stain
the glorie of the whole earth; and thou must know his
power, and the cup of his wrath is full, of which all nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
shall drink, and none shall escape it; prepare thy self,
for the anger of the Lord is gone forth, &amp; the Almightie
is greived because of the abominations of the earth, and
he will cast into the fire, and purge, and purifie, and new
mold, and correct, Rulers, Kings, and Peoples, for he hath
long been greived, and born the miquitie of the Nations,
but his long suffering is well-nigh finished, for the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
have provoked him to anger, and turned his long-suffering
into furie, and he hath put on the garment of
vengeance, and the time is at hand, that sorrow shall take
hold upon the stout-hearted, when he appears, who hath
been pierced; and anguish and pain shall come upon thee,
and the world, and the day of trouble, and great distress,
ye shall not escape: the rod of his wrath shall smite you,
the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it: And although
thou art exalted as a God, yet thou shalt be a man and
not a God in his hand, that shall slay thee, and although
thy seat hath been high<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet it shall be laid low as the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:29643:12"/>
ground, and thy honour shall be laid in the dust, for thou
art dust and ashes before the Lord, and thou shalt be no
more admired, when destruction shall come upon thee;
the Lord hath viewed thy way and path, and they have
not been upright before him; he hath entred into the
secrets of thine heart, and thine intent hath not been hid
from him, and that which hath been done in secret shall
now be laid open, and all secret things shall now be
brought to light, and all the Churches shall know that he
searches the heart, and trieth the reines, who is a God
great and mightie, and giveth unto all creatures life and
breath, and he will change at his pleasure all the children
of men, and bring them to an account before his Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-seat;
wherefore let all flesh tremble before him,
and let all the earth bow before his presence, who chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth,
and subdueth, and over-turneth at his pleasure,
and brings men to destruction, who hath rebelled against
him: Wherefore thou Pope, chief Bishop at <hi>Rome,</hi> this
is unto thee from the mouth of the Lord; come down,
come down, lay down thy crown, subject thy self, and
tremble before the Lord God of vengeance, least he
come upon thee and crush thee to pieces, and thou shalt
know that this hath the Lord spoken, in the day when
the fierie flaming sword, which is alreadie drawn, enters
into thy bosome, and smites thy honour and renown:
Behold, I have heard the voice of howling and bitter la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation;
I have heard the voice of war and not of
peace; I have seen, I have seen, the strong become weak,
and the mightie become miserable, and the proud and
honorable brought into contempt; yea, I have seen her
that hath sat as a Queen, that hath said, she shall never
see sorrow; I have seen the losse of children, and wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowhood
come upon her, even in one day; I have seen
her beautie turned into bitterness; I have seen her ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
brought into contempt; I have seen the Whore
that hath made all Nations drunk with her fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that hath had the golden cup in her hand; I have
seen the cup of indignation prepared for her to drink;
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:29643:13"/>
I have seen her cast upon the bed of never ceasing tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
I have seen the Citie that was full of people,
that was the glorie of Kingdoms, that made all Nations
rich with her traffick and merchandise; I have seen that
Citie laid desolate, and disinhabited, and made the sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
of the whole earth; and I have seen the smoak of
her burning ascend for ever; and this is, and must short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
come to passe; and if thou hast an ear to hear thou
mayest hear; and these things are true, and faithful,
and they shall not fail, but the wicked shall know the
Majestie, Dread, and Terror, the Vengeance and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation
of the Almightie.</p>
