            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A
SEASONABLE DISCOURSE</head>
            <p>THE Christian Religion, as first Instituted by our Blessed Saviour,
was the greatest security to Magistrates by the Obedience which it
taught, and was fitted to enjoy no less security under them by a
Practice conformable to that Doctrine. For our Saviour himself, not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to an Earthly Kingdom, took such case therefore to instruct his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
in the due Subjection to Governors; that, while they observed his
Precepts, they could neither fall under any Jealousy of State as an ambitious
and dangerous Party, nor, as Malefactors upon any other account, deserve to
suffer under the Publick Severity: So that in this only it could seem perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
to Goverment, that Christanity, if rightly exercised upon its own
Principles, would render all Magistracy useless. But although he, <hi>who was
Lord of all, and to whom all Power was given beth in Heaven and in Earth, was</hi>
nevertheless contented to come in the form of a Servant, and to let the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors
and Princes of the World alone with the use of their Dominions; he
thought it good reason to retain his Religion under his own cognizance,
and exempt its Authority from their Jurisdiction. In this alone he was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious,
and did not only practise it himself against the Laws and Customs
then received, and in the face of the Magistrate; but continually seasoned
and hardned his Disciples in the same confidence and obstinacy. He tells
them, <hi>They shall be brought before Kings and Governours for his Name,</hi> but sear
them not, he will be with them, bear them out, and justify it against all Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position.
Nor that he allowed them hereby to violate their Duty to the
Puplick, by any resistance in defiance of the Magistracy; but he instructed and
animated them in their Duty to God, in dispight of Suffering.</p>
            <p>In this manner Christanity did at first set out, and accordingly found re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.
For although our Blessed Saviour, <hi>having fulfilled all Righteousness,</hi>
and the time of his Ministry being compleated, did by his Death set the Seal
to his Doctrine, and shew the way toward Life and Immortality to such Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers
as imitate his Example: yet did not the <hi>Heathen</hi> Magistrate take the
Government to be concerned in Point of Religion, or upon that acount con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to his Execution. <hi>Pontious Pilate,</hi> then Governour of <hi>Iudea,</hi> though he
were a Man unjust and cruel by Nature, and served <hi>Tiberius,</hi> the most tender,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101402:3"/>
jealous and severe in point of State or Prerogative, of all the <hi>Roman</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors;
though he understood that great multitudes followed him, and that he
was grown the Head of a new Sect that was never before heard of in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
yet did not he intermeddle. But they were the Men of Religion, the
chief Priests, Scribes and Elders, and the High Priest <hi>Caiphas.</hi> And yet,
altho they accused him falsly, That <hi>he taught that Tribute was not to be given
to</hi> Caesar, that <hi>he was a</hi> Fifth Monarch, and <hi>made himself a King,</hi> and (as it is
usual for some of the Clergy to terrifie the inferiour Magistrates out of their
duty to Justice, out of pretence of Loyalty to the Prince) threatned <hi>Pilate,</hi> that
<hi>if he let that Man go he was not <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Friend;</hi> he understanding <hi>that they did
it out of Envy,</hi> and that the Justice and Innocence of our Saviour was what
they could not bear with, would have adventured all their Informing at
Court, and first have freed him, and then have exchanged him for <hi>Barrabas;</hi>
saying, that <hi>he found no fault in him:</hi> but he was overborn at last by humane
weakness, and poorly imagined that by washing his own hands he had expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
himself, and wiped off the Guilt upon those alone who were the occasion,
But, as for <hi>Tiberius</hi> himself, the growth of Christianity did never increase,
his cares of Empire at <hi>Rome,</hi> nor trouble his sleep at <hi>Capreae:</hi> but he both ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
of the Doctrine, and threatned the Informers with Death; nor
would he have staid there, but attempted, according to the way of their Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition,
upon the intelligence from <hi>Pilate,</hi> to have received <hi>Christ</hi> into the
number of their Deities. The Persecution of the Apostles after his Death, and
Martyrdom of <hi>Stephen,</hi> hap'ned not by the interposing of the Civil Magistrate
in the Matter of Religion, or any Disturbance occasioned by their Doctrines:
but arose from the High Priest and his Emissaries, by suborned Witnesses,
stirring up the Rabble in a brutish &amp; riotous manner to execute their cruelty.
How would the modern Clergy have taken &amp; represented it, had they lived
in the time of St. <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> and seen <hi>Ierusalem, Iudaea, and all the Region
round about</hi> Jordan <hi>go out to be baptized by him!</hi> Yet that <hi>Herod,</hi> for any thing
we read in Scripture, though he wanted not his Instillers, apprehended no
Commotion: and had not <hi>Caligula</hi> banished him and his <hi>Herodias</hi> together,
might in all appearance have lived without any change of Goverment. Twas
she that caused <hi>Iohn</hi>'s imprisonment for the conveniency of her Incest. <hi>Herod</hi>
indeed <hi>feared him,</hi> but rather reverenced him, <hi>as a just Man and an holy, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
him, and when he heard him, he did many things and heard him gladly.</hi> Nor
could all her subtilty have taken off his Head, but that <hi>Herod</hi> thought himself
under the obligation of a Dance and an Oath, and knew not in that Case they
ought both to be dispensed with. But <hi>he was exceeding sorry at his death,</hi> which
few Princes are if Men lived to their jealousie or danger. The killing of
<hi>Iames,</hi> and imprisonment of <hi>Peter</hi> by that <hi>Herod,</hi> was <hi>because he saw he pleased
the people,</hi> when the Priesls had once set them on madding: a Complaisance
to which the most Innocent may be exposed, but which partake more of
Guile then Civility or Wisdom.</p>
            <p>But to find out what the disinteressed and prudent Men of those days took
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101402:3"/>
to be the wisest and only justifiable way for the Magistrate to proceed in upon
Matters of Religion; I cannot see any thing more pregnant than the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Judgment of three Persons, of so different Characters, and that lived so
far asunder, that there can be no danger of their having corrupted one anothers
Understanding in favour to Christianity. <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> the Deputy of <hi>Acaia,</hi>
and the Town-Clerk of <hi>Ephesus;</hi> the first a Jewish Doctor, by Sect a Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risee,
one of the Council, and of great Authority with the People, who
(when the chief Priest had cast the Apostles in Prison, and charged them for
preaching against the Command he had before laid upon them) yet gave this
advice, confirming it with several fresh Precedents, <hi>Acts 5. That they should
take heed to themselves what they intended to do with those Men, and let them alone;
for if this Counsel,</hi> saith he, <hi>or this Work be of Men, it will come to nought,</hi> but <hi>if
it be of God you cannot overthrow it, lest ye be found fighting with God.</hi> So that
his Opinion grounded upon his best experience, was that the otherwise un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameable
Sect of Christianity might safely, and ought to be left to stand or fall
by God's Providence under a free Toleration of the Magistrate. The Second
was <hi>Gallio,</hi> Acts 18. a <hi>Roman,</hi> and Deputy of <hi>Achaia.</hi> The <hi>Iews</hi> at <hi>Corinth</hi>
hurried <hi>Paul</hi> before his Tribunal, laying the usual Charge against him, <hi>That
he persuaded Men to worship God contrary to the Law,</hi> which <hi>Gallio</hi> looked upon
as so slight and without his Cognizance, that altho most Judges are willing
to encrease the Jurisdiction of their Courts, <hi>He drave them away,</hi> saving
<hi>Paul</hi> the labour of a defence, and told them, <hi>If it were a Matter of wrong or
wicked lewdness, reason would that he should bear with them; but if it be a question
of Words and Names, and of your Law, look ye to it, I will be Iudg of no such
Matters:</hi> and when he had so said, <hi>Paul</hi> was released; but the <hi>Greeks</hi> that
were present took <hi>Barnabas,</hi> and before the Judgment Seat <hi>beat</hi> Sosthene; <hi>the
chief Ruler of the Synagogue,</hi> and Ringleader of the Accusers. His Judgment
therefore was that, to punish Christians meerly for their Doctrine &amp; Practice,
unless they were Malefactors otherwise, was a thing out of the Magistrates
Province, and altogether unreasonable. The third Case was no less remarkable:
For one <hi>Demetrius,</hi> that was a Silversmith by Trade, &amp; made Shrines for <hi>Diana,</hi>
stirred up all the Freemen of his Company against <hi>Paul,</hi> and indeed he stated
the Matter very fairly and honestly, assigning the true Reason of most of these
Persecutions: <hi>Ye know that by this Craft we have our Wealth, but that by</hi> Paul'<hi>s
Preaching that they be no Gods which are made with hands, not only our Craft is in
danger to be set at nought, but also the Temple of the great Goddess and her Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence,
whom all <hi>Asia</hi> and the World worship, should be despised and destroyed.</hi>
And it is considerable, that even the <hi>Iews,</hi> tho of a contrary Religion, yet
fomented, as it usually chances, this difference, and egg'd the <hi>Ephesians</hi> on
against the Apostle and his followers. But when they had brought <hi>Alexander,</hi>
one of <hi>Paul</hi>'s Companions, into the Theatre, the Recorder of <hi>Ephesus</hi> (more
temperate and wise than some would have been in that Office) would not make
an <hi>Inquisition</hi> upon the matter, nor put <hi>Alexander</hi> upon his trial and desence,
but (altho he himself could not have born that Office without being a great
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101402:4"/>
               <hi>Dianist,</hi> as he declared too in his discourse) he tells the People, <hi>They had brought
those Men which were neither robbers of Churches, nor blasphemers of their Goddess,</hi>
(for that Judg would not condemn Men by any Inferences or Expositions of
old Statutes, which long after was <hi>Iulian</hi>'s practice, and since imitated); <hi>and
therefore if</hi> Demetrius <hi>and his Craftsmen had any matter against them, the Law
was open, and it should be determined in a lawful Assembly; but that the whole
City was in danger to be called in question for that Vproar, there being no cause
whereby they might give account of that concourse.</hi> And by this he plainly enough
signified, that if <hi>Paul</hi> and his Companions had stoln the Church Plate, they
might well be Indicted; but that <hi>Demetrius</hi> had no more reason in Law against
them, than a Chandler might have had, if by <hi>Paul</hi>'s preaching Wax Tapers
as well as Silver Candlesticks had grown out of fashion. That it is matter
of Right and Wrong, betwixt Man and Man, that the Justice of Government
looks too: but that, while Christianity was according to its own Principle
carried on quietly, it might so fall that the disturbers of it were guilty of a
Riot, and their great City of <hi>Ephesus</hi> deserved to be fined for it. And taking
this to have been so, he dismist the Assembly, <hi>Acts</hi> 19.</p>
            <p>After these Testimonies which I have collected out of the History of the
<hi>Acts,</hi> as of greatest Authority, I shall only add one or two more out of the
same Book, wherein <hi>Paul</hi> likewise was concerned before Heathen Magistrates
of greater eminence, <hi>Acts 23. Ananias</hi> the High Priest (these always were
the Men) having countenanced and instigated the <hi>Iews</hi> to a Conspiracy, in
which <hi>Paul</hi>'s life was endangered and aimed at; <hi>Lysias</hi> the chief Captain of
<hi>Ierusalem</hi> interposes and sends him away to <hi>Foelix</hi> then Governor of <hi>Iudaea;</hi>
signifying by Letter, <hi>That he had been accused only of Questions of their Law,</hi> but
he found nothing to be laid to his Charge worthy of Death or of Bonds;
whereof <hi>Foelix</hi> also, tho the High Priest was so zealous in the prosecution,
that he took a Journey on purpose, and had instructed an exquisite Orator
<hi>Tertullus</hi> to harangue <hi>Paul</hi> out of his Life, as a <hi>pestilent Fellow, a mover of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
and a Ring-leader of the Sect of the</hi> Nazarenes, not omitting even to charge
<hi>Lysias</hi> for <hi>rescuing him by great violence</hi> from being murdered by them, was so
well satisfied of the contrary, upon full hearing, that he gave him his liberty,
and <hi>a Centurion for his guard, with command that none of his Acquaintance should
be debarred from coming and ministring to him.</hi> But being indeed to leave his
Government afterwards, <hi>left him in Prison,</hi> partly to shew the <hi>Iews</hi> and
their High Priest another piece of complaisant policy, which, 'tis possible
they paid well for, seeing the other Reason was, because tho he had <hi>sent
for</hi> Paul <hi>the oftner, and communed with him, in hopes that he would have given
him Mony to be discharged,</hi> there came nothing of it. Which was so base a
thing in so great a Minister, that the meanest Justice of the Peace in <hi>England</hi>
would scarce have the face to do so upon the like occasion. But his Successor
<hi>Festus,</hi> having called <hi>Agrippa</hi> and <hi>Bernice</hi> to hear the Cause, they all three
were of opinion, that it was all on the <hi>Iews</hi> side calumny and impertinence,
but that <hi>Paul</hi> had <hi>done nothing worthy of Death or of Bonds, and might have been
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:101402:4"/>
set free, but that having appealed to</hi> Caesar, he must be transmitted to him in safe
Custody. Such was the sence of those upon whom the Emperors then relied
for the Government and security of their Provinces: and so gross were their
Heathen understandings, that they could not yet comprehend how Quietness
was Sedition, or the innocence of the Christian Worship could be subject to
Forfeiture or Penalty. Nay, when <hi>Paul</hi> appeared even before <hi>Nero</hi> himself,
<hi>and had none to stand by him, but all forsook him:</hi> he was by that Emperor acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and permitted a long time to follow the work of his Ministry. 'Tis true,
that afterwards this <hi>Nero</hi> had the honour to be the first of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors
that persecuted Christianity; whence it is that <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his <hi>Apologetick</hi>
saith; <hi>We glory in having such a one the first beginner and Author of our Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
for there is none that hath read of him, but must understand some great good
to have been in that Doctrine, otherwise</hi> Nero <hi>would not have condemned it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thenceforward Christianity for about three hundred Years lay subject
to Persecution. For the <hi>Gentile</hi> Priests could not but observe a great decay in
their Parishes, a neglect of their Sacrifices, and diminution of their Profit by
the daily and visible increase of that Religion. And God in his wise Providence
had so ordered, that, as the <hi>Iews</hi> already, so the <hi>Heathens</hi> now having filled up
their measure with iniquity, <hi>Sprinkling the Blood of his Saints among their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices,</hi>
and the Christians having in a severe Apprentiship of so many Ages
learned the Trade of Suffering, they should at last be their own Masters and
admitted to their Freedom. Neither yet, even in those times when they lay
exposed to Persecution, were they without some Intervals and catching sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of Tranquillity, wherein the Churches had leisure to reap considerable
advantage, and the Clergy too might have been inured, as they had been
Exemplary under Affliction, so to bear themselves like Christians when they
should arrive at a full prosperity. For as oft as there came a just <hi>Heathen</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
and a lover of mankind, that either himself observed, or understood
by the Governours of his Provinces, the innocence of their Religion and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices,
their readiness to pay Tribute, their Prayers for his Goverment and
Person, their faithful Service in his Wars, but their Christian valour and
contumacy to Death, under the most exquisite Torments, for their holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession;
he forthwith relented, he rebated the Sword of the Executiner,
and could not find in his heart or in his power to exercise it against the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of that Religion. It being demonstrable that a Religion instituted upon
Justice betwixt Man and Man; love to one another, yea even their Enemies,
Obedience to the Magistrate in all Humane and Moral Matters, and in Divine
Worship upon a constant exercise thereof, and as constant Suffering in that
cause, without any pretence or latitude for resistance, cannot, so long as it is
true to it self in these things, fall within the Magistrate's Jurisdiction.</p>
            <p>But as it first was planted without the Magistrates hand, and the more they
plucked at it, so much the more still it flourished, so it will be to the end of the
world, and whensoever Governors have a mind to try for it, it will by the same
means and method sooner or later spoil them, but if they have a mind to pull
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:101402:5"/>
up that Mandrake, it were advisable for them not to do it themselves, but to
chuse out a Dog for the Imployment. I confess whensoever a Christian trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresses
these bounds once, he is impoundable, or like a Waif and Stray whom
<hi>Christ</hi> knows not, he falls to the Lord of the Mannor. But otherwise he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
suffer, he is invulnerable by the sword of Justice: only a Man may swear
and damn himself to kill the first honest Man he meets, which hath been and is
the case of all true Christians worshipping God under the power and violence
of their Persecutors.</p>
            <p>But the Truth is, that even in those times which some Men now, as oft as it
is for their advantage, do consecrate under the name of Primitive, the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
were become guilty of their own punishment, &amp; had it not been, as is most
usual, that the more Sincere Professors suffered promiscuously for the Sins and
Crimes of those that were Carnal and Hypocrites, their Persecutors may be
looked upon as having been the due Administrators of God's Justice. For (not
to go deeper) if we consider but that which is reckoned the Tenth Persecution
under <hi>Dioclesian,</hi> so incorrigible were they after nine preceding, what other
could be expected when, as <hi>Eusebius l. 3. c.</hi> 1. sadly laments, having related
how <hi>before that the Christians lived in great trust and reputation in Court, the
Bishops of each Church were beloved esteemed and reverenced by all mankind, and
by the Presidents of the Provinees, the Meetings in all the Cities were so many
and numerous, that it was necessary and allowed them to erect in every one spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
and godly Churches; all things went on prosperousty with them, and to
such an height, that no envious Man could disturb them, no Devil could hurt
them, as long as walking yet worthy of those Mercies they were under the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty's
care and Protection: after that our Affairs by that too much Liberty,
degenerated into Luxury and Laziness, and some prosecuted others with Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
and Contumely, and almost all of us wounded our selves with the Weapons
of the Tongue in ill Language, when Bishops set upon Bishops, and the People that
belonged to one of them, stirred Sedition against the People of another; then hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
Hypocrisie and Dissimulation sprung up to the utmost extremity of Malice,
and the Iudgment of God, while yet there was liberty to meet in Congregations,
did sensibly and by stops being to visit us, the Persecution at first discharging it
self upon our Brethren that were in the Army. But we having no feeling of the
Hand of God, not endeavouring to make our Peace with him, and living as if we
believed that God did neither take notice of our Transgressions, nor would visit us
for them, we heaped up Iniquity upon Iniquity. And those which seemed to be
our Pastors, kicking under-foot the Rules of Piety, were inflamed among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with mutual Contention, and while they minded nothing else but to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aggerate
their Quarrels, Threats, Emulation, Hatred and Enmities, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
each of them pursued his particular Ambition in a Tyrannical manner,
then indeed the Lord, then I say, according to the Voice of the Prophet</hi>
Jeremy,
<hi>he covered the Daugheer of</hi> Sion <hi>with a cloud in his anger, and cast down from
Heaven to Earth the beauty of</hi> Israel, <hi>and remembred not his footstool in the
day of his Anger.</hi> And so the pious Historian pathetically goes on, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plores
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:101402:5"/>
the Calamities that in sued, to the loss of all that stock of Reputation,
Advantage, Liberty and Safety, which Christian people had by true Plety, and
adhering strictly to the Rules of their Profession formerly acquired &amp; injoyed,
but had now forfeited, and smartly and defervedly suffered under <hi>Dioclesian</hi>'s
<hi>persecution.</hi> And it was <hi>a severe</hi> one, the longest too that ever happened, ten
Years from his beginning of it, and continued by others: by which time one
might have thought the Church would have been sufficiently winnowed, and
nothing left but the pure Wheat, whereas it proved quite contrary, and the
holiest and most constant of the Christians being blown away by Martyrdom,
it seem'd by the succeeding times, as if nothing but the Chaff and the Tares
had remained. But there was yet such a Seed left; and notwithstanding the
defection of many, so internal a vertue in the Religion it self, that <hi>Dioclosian</hi>
could no longer stand against it, and tired out in two Years time, was glad to
betake himself from rooting out Christianity to gardening, and to sow Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herbs
at <hi>Salona.</hi> And he with his Partner <hi>Maximiamus,</hi> resigned the Empire to
<hi>Galerius</hi> and <hi>Constantius,</hi> the excellent Father of a more glorious and Christian
Son, <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great, who in due season succeeded him, and by a chain
of God's extraordinry providence, seemed to have been let down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to be the Emperor of the whole World, and as I may say, the Universal
Apostle of Christianity.</p>
            <p>It is unexpressible the Vertue of that Prince, his Care, his Indulgence, his
Liberality, his own Example, every thing that could possibly tend to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion
and incouragement of true Religion and Piety. And in order to that
he thought he could not do better, neither indeed could he, then to shew a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
respect to the Clergy and Bishops, providing largely for their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence,
had they too on their part behaved themselves worthy of their High
Calling, and known to make right use of the advantages of his Bounty to the
same ends that they were by him intended. For if the Apostle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
<hi>that an Elder,</hi> provided <hi>he rule well, be accounted worthy of Double Honour,
especially those who labour in the Word and Dactrine,</hi> it excludes not a Decu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
or any further proportion, and indeed there cannot too high a value be set
upon such a Person: and God forbid too that any measure of wealth should
render a Clergy-man uncanonical. But alas, Bishops were already grown ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Name and Thing, than at the Apostles Institution; and had so altered
the property, that <hi>Paul</hi> would have had much difficulty by all the marks in
the 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. to have known them. They were ill enough under Persecution
many of them, but that long and sharp Winter under <hi>Dioclesian,</hi> being se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded
by so warm a Summer under <hi>Constantine,</hi> produced a Pestilence, which
as an Infection that seizes sometimes only one sort of Cattol, diffused it self
most remarkably thorow the whole body of the Clergy. From his reign the
most sober Historians date that New Disease which was so generally propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
then, and ever since transmitted to some of their Successors, that it hath
given reason to enquire whether it only happened to those Men as it might to
others, or were not inherent to the very Function. It show'd it self first in Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:101402:6"/>
then in Contention, next in Imposition, and after these Symptoms
broke out at last like a Plague-Sore in open Persecution. They the Bishops who
began to vouch themselves the Successors of <hi>Christ,</hi> or at least of his Apostles,
yet pretended to be Heirs and Executors of the <hi>Iewish</hi> High Priests, and the
Heathen Tyrants, and were ready to prove the Will. The Ignorant <hi>Iews</hi> and
Infidels understood not how to Persecute, had no Commission to meddle with
Religion, but the Bishops had studied the Scriptures, knew better things, and
the same, which was Cruelty and Tyranny in the Heathens, if done by a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
and Ecclesiastical hand, was allowed to be Church-government, and the
care of a Diocess. But that I may not seem to speak without book, or out-run
the History, I shall return to proceed by those degrees I newly mention'd,
whereby the Christian Religion was usurped upon, and those things became
their crime which were their duties.</p>
            <p>The first was the Ambition of the Bishops, which had even before this, taken
its rise, when in the intervals of the former Persecutions the Piety of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
had laid out ample provisions for the Church; but when <hi>Constantine</hi> not
only restored those which had been all consiscate under <hi>Dioclesian,</hi> but was
every day adding some new Possession, Priviledge, or Honour, a Bishoprick be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
very desirable, and was not only <hi>a Good Work,</hi> but a good Thing, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when there was no danger of paying as it was usual, formerly their First<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruits
to the Emperor by Martyrdom. The Arts by which Ambition climes,
are Calumny, Cruelty, Bribery, Adulation, all applied in their proper places
and seasons; and when the Man hath attained his end, he ordinarily shows
himself then in his colours, in Pride, Opiniastry, Contention, and all other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisit
or incident ill Qualities. And if the Clergy of those times had some
more dextrous and innocent way than this of managing their Ambition, it is
to be lamented <hi>inter Artes Deperditas,</hi> or lies enviously hid by some musty
Book-worm in his private Library. But so much I find, that both before, and
then, and after, they cast such Crimes at one another, that a Man would scarce
think he were reading an History of Bishops, but a Legend of Devils: and each
took such care to blacken his adversary, that he regarded not how he smutted
himself thereby, and his own Order, to the laughter or horror of the By-stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.
And one thing I remark particularly, that as <hi>Son of a Whore</hi> is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
Word of Reproach among the Laity, of the same use then among the
Clergy was <hi>Heretick.</hi> There were indeed Hereticks as well as there are Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stards,
and perhaps it was not their fault, (neither of 'em could help it) but the
Mothers or the Fathers; but they made so many Hereticks in those days, that
'tis hard to think they really believ'd them so, but adventur'd the Name only
to pick a Quarrel. And one thing that makes it very suspicious, is, that in
Ecclesiastical History, the Ringleader of any Heresy is for the most part accused
of having a mind to be a Bishop, though it was not the way to come to it. As
there was the damnable Heresie of the <hi>Novatians,</hi> against which <hi>Constantine,</hi>
notwithstanding his Declaration of general Indulgence at his coming in, was
shortly after so incensed, that he published a most severe Proclamation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:101402:6"/>
them; <hi>Cognoscite jam per legem hanc quae à me sancita est, O Novatiani,</hi> &amp;c.
prohibiting all their Meetings, not only in publick, but in their own private
Houses; and that all such P<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aces where they assembled for their Worship,
should be rased to the ground without delay or controversy, <hi>&amp;c. Eus.</hi> 1. 3.
c. 6. <hi>de vita Constantini.</hi> Now the Story the Bishops tell of <hi>Novatus</hi> the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of that Sect, <hi>Euseb.</hi> 6. l. 6. c. 42. is in the words of <hi>Cornelius</hi> the Bp of <hi>Rome,</hi>
the very first line; <hi>But that you may know that this brave</hi> Novatus <hi>did even before
that affect to be a Bishop,</hi> (a great Crime in him) <hi>that he might conceal that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulant
Ambition, he for a better cover to his Arrogance, had got some Confessors into
his Society,</hi> &amp;c. and goes on calling him all to nought; <hi>but then</hi> (saith he) <hi>he
came with two Reprobates of his own Heresy into a little, the very least, Shire of</hi> Italy:
<hi>and by their means seduced three most simple high-shoon Bishops, wheedling them
that they must with all speed go to</hi> Rome, <hi>and there meeting with other Bishops, all
Matters should be reconciled. And when he had got thither these three silly Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
as I said, that were not aware of his cunning, he had prepared a company of
Rogues, like himself, that treated them in a private Room very freely; and having
thwack'd their bellies and heads full with meat and drink, compell'd the poor drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
Bishops, by an imaginary and vain Imposition of Hands, to make</hi> Novatus <hi>also a
Bishop.</hi> Might not one of the same Order now better have conceal'd these
things, had they been true? but such was the discretion. Then he tells, <hi>that
one of the three returned soon after,</hi> repenting it seems next morning, <hi>and so he
receiv'd him again into the Church,</hi> unto the <hi>Laick Communion.</hi> But for the other
two, he had sent Successors into their places. And yet after all this ado, and
the whetting of <hi>Constantine,</hi> contrary to his own Nature, and his own Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
against the <hi>Novatians,</hi> I cannot find their Heresy to have been other,
than that that were the <hi>Puritans</hi> of those times, and a sort of <hi>Non-conformists,</hi>
that could have subscribed to the Six and thirty Articles, but differed only in
those of Discipline: and upon some Enormities therein separated, and (which
will always be sufficient to qualify an Heretick) they instituted Bishops of their
own in most places. And yet afterwards, in the time of the best <hi>Homoousian</hi>
Emperors, a sober and strictly Religious People did so constantly adhere to
them, that the Bishops of the Church too found meet to give them fair quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
for as much as <hi>they differ'd not in the Fundamentals, and therefore were of use
to them against Hereticks that were more dangerous and diametrically opposite to the
Religion.</hi> Nay insomuch, that even the Bishop of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> yea of <hi>Rome,</hi>
notwithstanding that most tender Point and Interest of Episcopacy, suffered
the <hi>Novatian</hi> Bishops to walk <hi>cheek by joul</hi> with them in their own Diocess;
until that, as <hi>Socr.</hi> l. 7. c. 11. <hi>the</hi> Roman <hi>Episcopacy having, as it were, passed
the boands of Priesthood, slip'd into a Secular Principality, and thenceforward the</hi>
Roman <hi>Bishops would not suffer their Meetings with Security; but, though they
commended them for their consent in the same Faith with them, yet took away all
their Estates.</hi> But at <hi>Constantinople</hi> they continued to fare better, the Bishops
of that Church <hi>embracing the</hi> Novatians, <hi>and giving them free liberty to keep their
Conventicles in their Churches.</hi> What, and to have their Bishops too, Altar
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:101402:7"/>
against Altar? A Condescension, which as our Nonconformists seem not to
desire or think of, so the Wisdom of these time; would, I suppose, judg to be
very unreasonable, but rather that it were sit to take the other course; and
that whatsoever Advantage the Religion might probably receive from their
Doctrine &amp; Party, 'tis better to suppress them, and make havock both of their
Estates and Persons. But however, the Hereticks in <hi>Constantine</hi>'s time had the
less reason to complain of ill Measure, seeing it was that the Bishops meted
by among themselves. I pass over that Controversy betwixt <hi>Cecilianus</hi> the
Bishop of <hi>Carthage,</hi> and his Adherents, with another set of Bishops there in
<hi>Africk;</hi> upon which, <hi>Constantine</hi> ordered ten of each Party to appear before
<hi>Miltiades</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and others, to have it decided. Yet after they
had given Sentence, <hi>Constantine</hi> found it necessary to have a Council for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view
of the Business, as in his Letter to <hi>Crestus</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Syracuse,</hi> Euseb.
l. 10. c. 6. <hi>Whereas several have formerly separated from the</hi> Catholick <hi>Heresy,</hi>
(for that word was not yet so ill natured, but that it might sometimes be used
in its proper and good sense); and then relates his Commission to the Bishop
of <hi>Rome,</hi> and others; <hi>But forasmuch as some having been careless of their own Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
and forgetting the reverence due to that most holy Heresy,</hi> (again) <hi>will not yet
lay down their enmity, nor admit the Sentence that hath bin given, obstinately affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that they were but a few that pronounced the Sentence, and that they did it
very precipitately, before they had duly enquired of the Matter; and from thence
it hath happened, that both they who ought to have kept a brotherly and unanimous
agreement together, do abominably and flagitionsly dissent from one another; and
such whose Minds are alienated from the most holy Religion, do make a mockery
boih of it and them. Therefore I,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>have commanded very many Bishops,
out of innumerable places, to meet at</hi> Arles, <hi>that what ought to have been
quieted upon the former Sentence pronounced, may now at least be determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nd,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>and you to be one of them; and therefore I have ordered the Prefect
of</hi> Sicily <hi>to furnish you with one of the publick Stage-Coaches, and so many Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,</hi>
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>Such was the use then of Stage-Coaches, Post-Horses, and Councils, to the
great disappointment and grievance of the <hi>many,</hi> both Men and Horses, and
Leather being Hackney, Hackney, jaded, and worn out upon the Errand of some conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and obstinate Bishop. So went the Affairs hitherto, and thus well dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
and prepared were the Bishops to receive the Holy Ghost a second time,
at the great and first general Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> which is so much celebrated.</p>
            <p>The occasions of calling it were two. The first a most important Question,
in which the Wit and Piety of their Predecessors, and now theirs successively
had been much exercised and taken up: that was upon what day they ought
to keep <hi>Easter;</hi> which tho it were no Point of Faith that it should be kept at
all, yet the very Calendary of it, was controverted with the same zeal, and
made as heavy ado in the Church, as if both Parties had been Hereticks. And
it is reckon'd by the Church Historians, as one of the chief felicities of <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>'s
Empire, to have quieted in that Council this main Controversy. The
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:101402:7"/>
second cause of the assembling them here, was indeed grown, as the Bishops
had order'd it, a Matter of the greatest weight and consequence to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion; one <hi>Arrius</hi> having, as is related<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the disturbance of the
Church, started a most pernicious Opinion in the Point of the Trinity. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
from all parts of the Empire, they met together at the City of <hi>Nice,</hi>
250 Bishops, and better, saith <hi>Eusebius</hi> a goodly company; 318 say others;
and the Animadverter too, with that pithy Remark, <hi>Pag. 23. Equal almost
to the number of Servants bred up in the House of</hi> Abraham. The Emperor
had accommodated them every where with the publick Posts, or laid Horses
all along for the convenience of their Journey thither; and all the time
they were there, supplied them abundantly with all sorts of Provision at his
own charges. And when they were all first assembled in Council, in the great
Hall of the Imperial Palace, he came in, having put on his best Clothes, to
make his Guests welcome; and saluted them with that profound Humility,
as if they all had been Emperors, nor would sit down in his Throne; no, it
was a very little &amp; low Stool<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> till they had all beckoned &amp; made signs to him
to sit down. No wonder if the first Council of <hi>Nice</hi> run in their Heads ever
after, and the ambitious Clergy, like those who have been long a-thirst,
took so much of <hi>Constantine</hi>'s Kindness, that they are scarce come to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
again, after so many Ages. The first thing was that he acquainted
them with the Causes of his summoning them thither, and in a grave and most
Christian Discourse, <hi>exhorted them</hi> to keep the Peace, or <hi>to a good Agreement,</hi>
as there was reason. <hi>For</hi> (saith <hi>Russin.</hi> 1. 1. c. 2.) <hi>the Bishops being met here from
almost all parts, and as they use to do, bringing their Quarrels about several matters
along with them, every one of them was at the Emperor, offering him Petitions, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out one anothers Faults,</hi> (for all the good advice he had given them) <hi>and were
more intent upon these things, than upon the business they were sent for. But he, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
that by these Scoldings and Bickerings, the main Affair was frustrated, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
a set-day by which all the Bishops should bring him in whatsoever complaint
they had against one another.</hi> And they being all brought, he made them that
high <hi>Asiatick</hi> Complement; <hi>God hath made you Priests, and hath given you power
to judg me, and therefore it is in you to judg me righteously; but you cannot be judged
by any Men. It is God only can judg you, and therefore reserve all your quarrels to
his Tribunal. For you are as Gods to me, and it is not convenient that a Man should
judg of Gods, but he only of whom it is written,</hi> God standing in the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Gods, and discerneth in the midst of them. <hi>And therefore setting
these things aside, apply your Minds, without any contention, to the concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of God's Religion.</hi> And so, <hi>without opening or reading one Petition, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
them altogether to be burnt there in his presence.</hi> An Action of great
Charity and excellent Wisdom, had but some of the words been spared. For
doubtless, tho they that would have complained of their burthen, grum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
a little; yet those that were accusable were all very well satisfied: and
those expressions, <hi>You can judg me right eously,</hi> and, <hi>you cannot be judged by any
Man;</hi> and, <hi>God only can judg you. You are Gods to me,</hi> &amp;c. were so extreamly
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:101402:8"/>
sweet to most of the Bishops Palates, that they believ'd it, and could never
think of them afterwards, but their Teeth watered; and they ruminated so
long on them, that <hi>Constantine</hi>'s Successors came too late to repent it. But
now the Bishops having mist of their great end of quarelling one with another,
betake themselves, tho somewhat aukwardly, to Business. And it is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to mine, that as shortly as possible for the understanding of it, I give a
cursory account of <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Arrius,</hi> with some few others that were the
most interessed in that general &amp; first great Revolution of <hi>Ecclesiastical Affairs,</hi>
since the days of the Apostles. This <hi>Alexander</hi> was the Bishop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi>
and appears to have been a pious old Man, but not equally prudent, nor in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
things of the most capable, nor in conducting the Affairs of the Church
very dextrous, but he was the Bishop. This Character that I have given of
him, I am the more confirm'd in from some passages that follow, and all of
them pertinent to the matter before me. They were used, <hi>Sozem.</hi> l. 2. c. 16.
at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> to keep yearly a solemn Festival to the memory of <hi>Peter,</hi> one
of their former Bishops, upon the same day that he suffered Martyrdom, which
<hi>Alexander</hi> having celebrated at the Church, with publick Devotion, was
sitting after at home, expecting some Guests to dine with him, <hi>Sozom.</hi> 1. 2.
c. 16. As he was alone, and looking towards the Sea-side, he saw a pretty
way off, the Boys upon the Beach at an odd Recreation, imitating it seems
the Rites of the Church, and Office of the Bishops; and was much delighted
with the sight, as long as it appear'd an innocent and harmless representation:
But when he observed them at last how they acted, the very administriation of
the Sacred Mysteries, he was much troubled; and sending for some of the
chief of his Clergy, caused the Boys to be taken and brought before him. He
asked them particularly what kind of Sport they had been at, and what the
Words, and what the Actions were that they had used in it. After their fear
had hindred them a while from answering, and now they were afraid of being
silent, they confess'd that a Lad of their Play-fellows, one <hi>Athanasius,</hi> had
Baptized some of them that were not yet initiated to those Sacred Mysteries:
Whereupon <hi>Alexander</hi> inquired the more accurately what the Bishop of the
Game had said, and what he did to the Boys he had baptized; what they also
had answered or learned from him. At last, when <hi>Alexander</hi> perceived by
them, that this Pawn Bishop had made all his Removes right, and that the
whole Ecclesiastical Order &amp; Rites had been duly observed in their Interlude,
he by the advice of his Priests about him, approved of that Mock-baptism, and
determined that the Boys, <hi>being once in the simpliciey of their minds dipped in the
Divine Grace, ought not to be Re-baptized,</hi> but he perfected it with the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Mysteries, which it is only lawful for Priests to administer. And then he
delivered <hi>Athanasius</hi> and the rest of the Boys that had acted the parts of <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters</hi> and <hi>Deacons,</hi> to their Parents; calling God to witness, that they should
be Educated in the Ministry of the Church, that they might pass their lives in
that Calling which they had chosen by imitation. But as for <hi>Athanasius,</hi> in a
short while after, <hi>Alexander</hi> took him to live with him, and be his Secretary,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:101402:8"/>
having caused him to be carefully Educated in the Schools of the best <hi>Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marians</hi>
and <hi>Rhetoricians;</hi> and he grew, in the opinion of all that spoke with
him, a discreet and eloquent person, and will give occasion to be more than
once mentioned again in this Discourse; I have translated this, in a manner,
word for word from the Author. This good-natured old Bishop <hi>Alexander,</hi>
that was so far from Anathemising, that he did not so much as whip the Boys
for the Profanation of the Sacrament against the Discipline of the Church, but
without more doing, left them, for ought I see, at liberty, to regenerate as
many more Lads upon the next Holy-day, as they thought convenient: He
<hi>Socr.</hi> l. 1. <hi>c. 3. being a Man that lived an easie and gentle life, had one day called
his Priests, and the rest of his Clergy together, and fell on Philosophizing divinely
among them, but something more subtily and curiously</hi> (though I dare say he meant
no harm) <hi>than was usual, concerning the Holy Trinity.</hi> Among the rest, one
<hi>Arrius,</hi> a Priest too of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> was there present, a Man who is described
to have been a good Disputant; and others add, (the Capital Accusations of
those times) that he had a mind to have been a Bishop, and bore a great pique
at <hi>Alexander,</hi> for having been preferr'd before him to the See of <hi>Alexandria;</hi>
but more are silent of any such matter; and <hi>Sozom.</hi> l. 1. <hi>c.</hi> 14. saith, <hi>he was in
great esteem with his Bishop.</hi> But <hi>Arrius,</hi> Socr. l. 1. c. 3. <hi>hearing his discourse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Holy Trinity, and the Vnity in the Trinity, conceiv'd that, as the Bishop
stated it, he had reason to suspect he was introducing afresh into the Church, the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie
of</hi> Sabellius <hi>the</hi> African, who <hi>Fatebatur unum esse Deum, &amp; ita in unam essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am
Trinitatem adducebat, ut assereret nullam esse vere subjectam proprietatem personis,
sed nomina mutari pro eo atque usus poscant, ut nuncde illo ut patre, nunc ut filio, nunc
ut spiritu sancto disseratur:</hi> And thereupon, it seems, <hi>Arrius</hi> argued warmly for
that opinion which was directly contrary to the <hi>African,</hi> driving the Bishop
from one to a second, from a second to a third seeming absurdity, which I
studiously avoid the relation of; that in all these things I may not give occasion
for Mens understandings to work by their memories, and propagate the same
errors by the same means they were first occasion'd. But hereby <hi>Arrius</hi> was
himself blamed as the maintainer of those absurdities, which he affixed to the
Bishops opinion, as is usual in the heat and wrangle of Disputation. Whereas
Truth, for the most part, lies in the middle, but Men ordinarly seek for it in
the extremities. Nor can I wonder that those ages were so fertile in what
they called Heresies, when being given to meddling with the mysteries of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
further than humane apprehension, or divine revelation did or could
lead them, some of the Bishops were so ignorant and gross, but others so spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative,
acute, and resining in their conceptions, that there being moreover
a good fat Bishoprick to boot in the case, it is rather admirable to me how all
the Clergy from one end to another, could escape from being, or being accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Hereticks. <hi>Alexander</hi> hereupon, <hi>Soz.</hi> l. 1. c. 14. instead of stilling by
more prudent Methods this new Controversie, took doubtless with a very
good intention, a course that hath seldom been successful: makes himself
judg of that wherein he had first been the Party, and calling to him some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>others
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:101402:9"/>
of his Clergy, would needs sit in publick, to have a solemn set Disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
about the whole Matter. And while <hi>Arrius</hi> was at it Tooth and Nail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his Opposers, and the Arguments flew so thick, that they darkned the
Air, and no Man could yet judg which side should have the Victory; the
good Bishop for his part sat <hi>hay now hay,</hi> neither could tell in his Conscience
of a long time, which had the better of it; but sometimes he lean'd on one
side, and then on the other, and now encouraged and commended those of
one Party, and presently the contrary; but at last, by his own weight, he cast
the Scales against <hi>Arrius.</hi> And from thenceforward, he excommunicated
<hi>Arrius</hi> for obstinacy; who writing in behalf of himself and his Followers to the
Bishop, each one stating his own, and his Adversaries case, with the usual
candor of such Men in such Matters; the Bishops too all over began to divide
upon it, and after them their People. Insomuch, that <hi>Constantine,</hi> out of a
true paternal sense and care, found necessary to send a very prudent and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Person to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> to try if he could accommodate the Matter, giving
him a Letter to <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Arrius:</hi> How discreet, how Christian-like, I
never read any thing of that nature equal to it, it is too long for me here to
insert; but I gladly recommend my Reader to it, in the 2 <hi>Eus.</hi> de vitô <hi>Const.</hi>
c. 67. where he begins, <hi>I understand the Foundation of the Controversy to have
been this, That thou</hi> Alexander <hi>didst inquire of the Priests concerning a Passage in
the Scripture; nay, didst ask them concerning a frivolous quillet of a question, what
was each of their Opinions: And thou</hi> Arrius <hi>didst inconsiderately babble what thou
neither at the beginning couldst conceive; and if thou hadst conceived so, oughtest
not to have vented,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But the Clergy having got this once in the Wind, there was no beating
them off the Scent. Which induced <hi>Constantine</hi> to think the convening of
this Council the only Remedy to these Disorders. And a woful ado he had
with them, when they were met, to manage and keep them in any tolerable
<hi>decorum.</hi> It seemed like an Ecclesiastical Cock-pit, and a Man might have
laid Wagers either way, the two Parties contending in good earnest, either
for the Truth or the Victory; but the more unconcern'd, like cunning Betters,
sate judiciously hedging, and so ordered their Matter, that which side soever
prevail'd, they would be sure to be the Winners. They were indeed a most
venerable Assembly, composed of some Holy, some Grave, some Wise, and
some of them Learned Persons: And <hi>Constantine</hi> had so charitably burnt the
Accusations they intended against one another, which might otherwise have
depopulated and dispirited the Council, that all of them may be presumed in
one or other respect, to have made a great Character. But I observe <hi>Soz.</hi>
l. 1. c. 16. that these great Bishops, although they only had the decisive
Voices, yet thought fit to bring along with them, certain Men that were cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
at an Argument, to be auxiliary to them when it came to hard and tough
Disputation; besides, that they had their Priests and Deacons ready at a dead
lift, alway to assist them: So that their Understandings seem'd to be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quester'd,
and for their daily Faith, they depended upon what their Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:101402:9"/>
would allow them. And in that quality <hi>Athanasius</hi> there waited upon
<hi>Alexander,</hi> being his Deacon, (for as yet it seems Arch-Bishops nor Arch-Deacons
were invented). And it is not improbable that <hi>Athanasius</hi> having so
early personated the Bishop, and seeing the declining Age of <hi>Alexander,</hi> would
be careful that <hi>Arrius</hi> should not step betwixt him and home upon Vacancy,
but did his best against him to bar up his way, as it shortly after happened;
<hi>Athanasius</hi> succeeding after the Council in the See of <hi>Alexandria.</hi> In the mean
time you may imagine <hi>Hypostasis, Persona, Substantia, Subsistentia, Essentia,
Coessentialis, Consubstantialis, Ante soecula Coaeternus,</hi> &amp;c. were by so many Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putants
pick'd to the very Bones, and those too broken afterwards, to come to
the Marrow of Divinity. And never had <hi>Constantine</hi> in his Life so hard a
task, as to bring them to any rational Results; <hi>Meekly and patiently</hi> (Euseb.
l. 3. c. 13. de Vita Const.) <hi>listning to every one, taking every Man's Opinion, and
without the Acrimony with which it was delivered, helping each Party where they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreed,
reconciling them by degrees when they were in the fiercest Contention, confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
with them apart courteously and mildly, telling them what was his own Opinion of
the Matter:</hi> Which tho some exceptious Persons may alledg to have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the nature of a free Council, yet truly, unless he had taken that course,
I cannot imagine how possibly he could ever have brought them to any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion.
And thus this first, Great, General Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> with which the
World had gone big so long, and which look'd so big upon all Christendom,
at last was brought in Bed, and after a very hard Labour, delivered of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moousios.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They all subscribed to the new Creed, except some seventeen, who it seems
had rather to be Hereticks than Bishops. For now the <hi>Anathema</hi>'s were pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished,
and whoever held the contrary, was to be punish'd by Deprivation and
Banishment, all <hi>Arrian</hi> Books to be burned; and whoever should be disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
to conceal any of <hi>Arrius</hi> his Writings, to die for it. But it fared very
well with those who were not such fools as to own his Opinion. All they were
entertain'd by the Emperor at a magnificent Feast, received from his hand
rich Presents, and were honourably dismist, with Letters recommending
their great Abilities and performance to the Provinces, and enjoining the
<hi>Nicene</hi> Creed to be henceforth observed. With that stroke of the Pen, (<hi>Socr.</hi>
l. 1. c. 6.) <hi>For what three hundred Bishops have agreed on,</hi> (a thing indeed extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary)
<hi>ought not to be otherwise conceiv'd of, than as the Decree of God Almighty,
especially seeing the Holy Ghost did sit upon the Minds of such and so excellent Men,
and open'd his Divine Will to them.</hi> So that they went, I trow, with ample satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction;
and, as they could not but take the Emperor for a very civil, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
and obliging Gentleman, so they thought the better of themselves from
that day forward. And how budg must they look when they return back
to their Diocesses, having every one of 'em bin a principal Limn of the <hi>Oecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menical,
Apostolical, Catholick, Orthodox</hi> Council! when the Catacheristical
Title of the Church and the Clergy were so appropriate to them by custom,
that the Christian People had relinquished or forgotten their Claim; when
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:101402:10"/>
every Hare that crossed their way homeward, was a Schismatick or an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick;
and if their Horse stumbled with one of them, he incurr'd an Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema.
Well it was that their Journeys lay so many several ways, for they
were grown so cumbersom and great, that the Emperor's High-way was too
narrow for any two of them, and there could have been no passage without the
removal of a Bishop. But soon after the Council was over, <hi>Eusebius</hi> the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> and <hi>Theognis</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Nice,</hi> who were already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved,
both by Banishment, and two others put in their places, were quickly
restor'd upon their Petition; wherein they suggested the Cause of their not
Signing to have been only, because they thought they could not with a safe
Conscience subscribe the Anathema against <hi>Arrius,</hi> appearing to them both by
his Writings, his Discourses, and Sermons, that they had been Auditors of,
not to be guilty of those Errors. As for <hi>Arrius</hi> himself, the Emperor quickly
wrote to him. <hi>It is now a considerable time since I wrote to your Gravity to come
to my Tents, that you might enjoy my Countenance; so that I can scarce wonder
sufficiently why you have so long delayed it: therefore now take one of the publick
Coaches, and make all speed to my Tents; that, having had experience of my
kindness and affection to you, you may return into your own Country. God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
you, most dear Sir. Arrius</hi> hereupon (with his Comerade <hi>Euxoius</hi>) comes
to <hi>Constantine</hi>'s Army, and offers him a Petition, with a Confession of Faith,
that would have pass'd very well before the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, and now satisfied
the Emperor, <hi>Socr.</hi> l. 1. c. 19, &amp; 20. insomuch that he writ to <hi>Athanasius,</hi> now
Bishop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> to receive him into the Church: but <hi>Athanasius</hi> was
of better mettle than so, and absolutely refused it. Upon this <hi>Constantine</hi> writ
him another threatning Letter: <hi>When you have understood hereby my Pleasure,</hi>
see that you afford free entrance into the Church, to all that desire it: for if I
shall understand that any who desires to be admitted into the Church, should
be either hindred or forbidden by you, I will send some one of my Servants to
remove you from your <hi>Degree,</hi> and place another in your stead. Yet <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasius</hi>
stood it out still, tho other Churches received him into Communion:
and the Heretick <hi>Novatus</hi> could not have bin more unrelenting to lapsed Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
than he was to <hi>Arrius.</hi> But this, joined with other Crimes, which were
laid to <hi>Athanasius</hi> his Charge, at the Council of <hi>Tyre,</hi> (though I suppose in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
they were forged) made <hi>Athanasius</hi> glad to fly for it, and remain the
first time in Exile. Upon this whole Matter, it is my impartial Opinion that
<hi>Arrius,</hi> or whosoever else were guilty of teaching and publishing those Errors
whereof he was accused, deserved the utmost Severity which consists with the
Christian Religion. And so willing I have been to think well of <hi>Athanasius,</hi>
and ill of the other, that I have on purpose avoided the reading, as I do the
naming of a Book that I have heard, tells the story quite otherwise, and have
only made use of the current Historians of those Times, who all of them tell
it against the <hi>Arrians.</hi> Only I will confess, that as in reading a particular Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
at adventure, a Man finds himself inclinable to favour the weaker Party,
especially if the Conqueror appear insolent; so have I been affected in reading
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:101402:10"/>
these Authors, which does but resemble the reasonable pity that men ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
have too, for those, who, though for an erroneous Conscience, suffer under
a Christian Magistrate. And as soon as I come to <hi>Constantius,</hi> I shall for that
reason change my compassion, and be doubly engaged on the Orthodox party.
But as to the whole matter of the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> I must crave liberty to say,
that from one end to the other, though the best of the kind, it seems to me to
have been a pitiful humane business, attended with all the ill circumstances of
other wordly affairs, conducted by a spirit of ambition and contention, the
first, and so the greatest oecumenical blow that by Christians was given to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity.
And it is not from any sharpness of humor that I discourse thus freely
of Things and Persons, much less of Orders of men otherwise venerable, but
that where ought is extolled beyond reason, and to the prejudice of Religion,
it is necessary to depreciate it by true proportion. It is not their censure of
<hi>Arrianism,</hi> or the declaring of their Opinion in a controverted point to the
best of their understanding, (wherein to the smalness of mine, they appear to
have light upon the Truth, had they likewise upon the measure) that could
have moved me to tell so long story, or bring my self within the danger and
aim of any captious Reader, speaking thus with great liberty of mind, but little
concern for any prejudice I may receive, of things that are by some Men ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized.
But it is their Imposition of a new Article or Creed upon the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
world, not being contained in express words of Scripture, to be believed
with Divine Faith, under Spiritual and Civil Penalties, contrary to the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
of Religion, and their making a Precedent follow'd and improv'd by
all succeeding Ages for most cruel Persecutions, that only could animate me.
In digging thus for a new deduction, they undermined the fabrick of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity,
to frame a particular Doctrine, they departed from the general Rule of
their Religion; and for their curiosity about an Article concerning <hi>Christ,</hi> they
violated our Saviour's first Institution of a Church, not subject to any Addition
in matters of Faith, nor liable to Compulsion, either in Belief or in Practice.
Far be it from me in the event, as it is from my Intention, to derogate from the
just authority of any of those Creeds or Confessions of Faith that are receiv'd
by our Church upon clear agreement with the Scripture: nor shall I therefore,
unless some mens impertinence and indiscretion hereafter oblige me, pretend to
any further knowledg of what in those particulars appear in the ancient Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories.
But certainly if any Creed had been Necessary, or at the least Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to have been Imposed, our Saviour himself would not have left his Church
distitute in a thing of that moment. Or however, after the Holy Ghost, upon
his departure, was descended upon the Apostles, and <hi>they the Elders and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi>
(for so it was then) were assembled in a legitimate Council at <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,
it would have seemed good to the Holy Ghost and them</hi> to have sav'd the
Council of <hi>Nice</hi> that labour, or at least the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Cor. 12. 2, and 4.
<hi>who was caught up into Paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not
lawful for any Man to utter,</hi> having thereby a much better opportunity than
<hi>Athanasius,</hi> to know the Doctrine of the Trinity, would not have been want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:101402:11"/>
               <hi>through the abundance of that revelation,</hi> to form a Creed for the Church,
sufficient to have put that business beyond controversie. Especially seeing
Heresies were sprung up so early, and he foresaw others, and therefore does
prescribe the mothod how they are to be dealt with, but no Creed that I read
of.</p>
            <p>Shall any sort of Men presume to interpret those words, which to him were
unspeakable, by a Gibbrish of their Imposing, and force every Man to Cant
after them, what it is not lawful for any Man to utter? <hi>Christ</hi> and his Apostles
speak articulately enough in the Scriptures, without any Creed, as much as
we are or ought to be capable of. And the Ministry of the Gospel is useful and
most necessary, if it were but to press us to the reading of them, to illustrate
one place by the authority of another, to inculcate those duties which are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
required, quickning us both to Faith and Practice, and showing within
what bounds they are both circumscribed by our Saviour's Doctrine. And
it becomes every Man to be able to give a reason and account of his Faith, and
to be ready to do it, without officiously gratifying those who demand it only to
take advantage: and the more Christians can agree in one confession of Faith,
the better. But that we should believe ever the more for a Creed, it cannot
be expected. In those days, when Creeds were most plenty and in fashion,
and every one had them at their fingers end, 'twas the Bible that brought in
the Reformation. 'Tis true, a Man would not stick to take two or three
Creeds for a need, rather than want a Living; and if a Man have not a good
swallow, 'tis but wrapping them up in a Liturgy, like a Wafer, and the whole
dose will go down currently; especially if he wink at the same time, and give
his Assent and Consent without ever looking on them. But without jesting,
for the matter is too serious: Every Man is bound to <hi>work out his own Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with fear and trembling,</hi> and therefore to use all helps possible for his best
satisfaction; hearing, conferring, reading, praying for the assistance of God's
Sprit: but when he hath done this, he is his own Expositor, his own both
Minister and People, Bishop and Diocess, his own Council; and his Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
excusing or condemning him, accordingly he escapes or incurs his own
internal Anathema. So that when it comes once to a Creed, made and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
by other Men as a matter of Divine Faith, the Case grows very delicate;
while he cannot apprehend, tho the Imposer may, that all therein is clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
contained in Scripture, and may fear, being caught in the expressions, to
oblige himself to a latitude or restriction, further than comports with his own
sense and judgment. A Christian of honour, when it comes to this once,
will weigh every word, every syllable; nay fruther, if he consider that the
great business of this <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Nice</hi> was but one single letter of the Alphabet,
about the inserting or omitting of an <hi>Iota.</hi> There must be either that exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in the Form of such a Creed, as I dare say, no Meu in the world ever were
or ever will be able to modulate: or else this scrupulous privat judgment must
be admitted, or otherwise all Creeds become meer instruments of Equivoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or Persecution. And I must confess, when I have sometimes considered
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:101402:11"/>
with my self the dulness of the Non-conformists, and the acuteness on the
contrary of the Episcoparians, and the conscientiousness of both; I have
thought that our Church might safely wave the difference with them about
Ceremonies, and try it upon the Creeds, which were both the more honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
way, and more suitable to the method of the ancient Councils, and yet
perhaps might do their business as effectually. For one that is a Christian in
good earnest, when a Creed is imposed, will sooner eat fire, than tak it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his judgment. There have been Martyrs for Reason, and it was manly
in them: but how much more would Men be so for Reason Religionated and
Christianized! But it is an Inhumane and Unchristian thing of those Faith-stretchers,
whosoever they be, that either put Mens Persons, or their Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
upon the torture, or rack them to the length of their Notions: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the <hi>Bereans</hi> are made Gentlemen, and Innobled by Patent in the <hi>Acts,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they would not credit <hi>Paul</hi> himself, whose Writings now make so great
a part of the New Testament, until <hi>they</hi> had <hi>searched the Scripture daily, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
those things were so, and therefore many of them believed.</hi> And therefore,
although where there are such Creeds, Christians may for Peace and Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence-sake
acquiesce while there appears nothing in them flatly contrary to the
words of the Scripture; yet when they are obtruded upon a Man in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
he will look very well about him, and not take them upon any Humane
Authority. The greatest Pretence to Authority, is in a Council. But what
then? shall all Christians therefore take their Formularies of Divine Worship
or Belief upon trust, as writ in Tables of Stone, like the Commandments, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd
from Heaven, and to be obeyed in the instant, not considered; because
three hundred and eighteen Bishops are met in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s great Hall, of which
most must be Servants, and some Children; and they have resolv'd upon't in
such a manner? No, a good Christian will not, cannot atturn and indenture
his Conscience over, to be Represented by others. It is not as in Secular
matters, where the States of a Kingdom are deputed by their fellow Subjects
to transact for them, so in spiritual: or suppose it were, yet 'twere necessary,
as in the <hi>Polish</hi> constitution, that nothing should be obligatory as long as there
is one Dissenter, where no Temporal Interests, but every Mans Eternity and
Salvation are concerned. The Soul is too precious to be let out at interest
upon any humane security, that does or may fail; but it is only safe when un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
God's custody, in its own Cabinet. But it was a General Council. A
special General indeed, if you consider the proportion of three hundred and
eighteen to the Body of the Christian Clergy, but much more to all Christian
Man-kind. But it was a General Free Council of Bishops. I do not think it
possible for any Council to be free, that is composed out of Bishops, and where
they only have the Decisive Voices. Nor that a Free Council that takes away
Christian Liberty. But that, as it was founded upon Usurpation, so it terminated
in Imposition. But 'tis meant, that it was Free from all external Impulsion.
I confess that good Meat and Drink, and Lodging, and Mony in a Man's

to 'em, nor was there any false Article in it. And discoursing now with
one, and then another of 'em in particular, and the Emperor telling them this
is my opinion, I understand it thus; and afterwards declaring his mind fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
to them in publick; no force neither. Ay, but there was a shrewd
way of persuasion in it. And I would be glad to know when ever, and which
free general Council it was that could properly be called so; but was indeed a
meer Imperial or Ecclesiastical Machine, no free agent, but wound up, set on
going, and let down by the direction and hand of the Workman. A General
Free Council is but a word of Art, and can never happen but under a Fifth
Monarch, and that Monarch too, to return from Heaven. The Animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
will not allow the second General Council of <hi>Nice</hi> to have bin Free, <hi>because
it was overaw'd by an Empress,</hi> and was guilty of a great fault (which no Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
at liberty he saith could have committed) the Decree for worshipping of
Images. At this rate a Christian may scuffle however for one point among
them, and chuse which Council he likes best. But in good earnest, I do not
see but that <hi>Constantine</hi> might as well at this first Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> have negoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
the Image-worship, as to pay that superstitious adoration to the Bishops,
and that Prostration to their Creeds was an Idolatry more pernicious in the
consequence, to the Christian Faith, then that under which they so lately had
suffer'd Persecution. Nor can a Council be said to have been at liberty, which
lay under so great and many obligations. But the Holy Ghost was present,
where there were three hundred and eighteen Bishops, and directed them, or
three hundred. Then, if I had been of their Council, they should have sate at
it all their lives, lest they should never see him again after they were once
risen. But it concerned them to settle their <hi>Quorum</hi> at last by his Dictates; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
no Bishop could have been absent, or gone forth upon any accusation,
but he let him out again: and it behov'd to be very punctual in the Adjourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
'Tis a ridiculous conception, and as gross as to make him of the same
substance with the Council. Nor needs there any stronger argument of his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
then their pretence to be actuated by him, and in doing such work. The
Holy Spirit! If so many of them, when they got together, acted like rational
men, 'twas enough in all reason, and as much as could be expected.</p>
            <p>But this was one affectation, among many others, which the Bishops took up
so early, of the stile, priviledges, powers, and some actions and gestures
peculiar and inherent ot the Apostles, which they misplaced to their own be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoof
and usage; nay, and challenged other things as Apostolical, that were
directly contrary to the Doctrine and Practice of the Apostles. For so, because
the Holy Spirit did in an extraordinary manner preside among the Holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
at that Legitimate Council of <hi>Ierusalem, Acts</hi> 15. they, although under
an ordinary Administration, would not go less whatever came on't: nay,
whereas the Apostles, in the drawing up of their Decree, dictated to them by
the Holy Spirit, said therefore no more but thus: <hi>The Apostles, Elders, and
Brethren, send greeting unto the Brethren of,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Forasmuch as,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>It seemed
good to the Holy Ghost and us, to lay upon you no greater burthen than these necessary
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:101402:13"/>
things; that ye abstain from,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>from which if ye keep your selves, you shall
do well.</hi> Fare ye well.</p>
            <p>This Council denounces every Invention of its own, (far from the Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
modesty, and the stile of the Holy Spirit) under no less than an <hi>Anathema.</hi>
Such was their arrogating to their inferior degrees, the stile of <hi>Clergy,</hi> till
custom hath so much prevailed, that we are at a loss how to speak properly,
either of the Name or Nature of their Function. Whereas the <hi>Clergy,</hi> in the
true and Apostolical sense, were only those whom they superciliously always
call the <hi>Laity:</hi> The word <hi>Clerus</hi> being never but once used in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and in that signification, and in a very unlucky place too, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 3.
where he admonishes the Priesthood, <hi>that they should not lord it, or domineer
over</hi> the Christian People, <hi>Clerum Domini,</hi> or <hi>the Lord's Inheritance.</hi> But
having usurp'd the Title, I confess they did right to assume the Power. But to
speak of the Priesthood in that stile which they most affect, if we consider the
nature too of their Function, what were the <hi>Clergy</hi> then, but Laymen disguis'd,
drest up perhaps in another habit? Did not St. <hi>Paul</hi> himself, being a Tent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker,
rather than be idle or burthensom to his People, work of his trade, even
during his Apostleship, to get his living? But did not these, that they might
neglect their holy Vocation, seek to compass secular Imploiments, and Lay-Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices?
Were not very many of them, whether one respect their Vices or Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
as well qualified as any other to be Lay-men? Was it not usual, as oft
as they merited it, to restore them, as in the case even of the three Bishops to
the Lay-communion? And whether, if they were so peculiar from others, did
the Imposition of the Bishop's hands, or the lifting up the hands of the Laity,
confer more to that distinction? And <hi>Constantine,</hi> notwithstanding his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement
at the burning of the Bishops Papers, thought he might make them,
and unmake them, with the same Power as he did his other Lay-Officers. But
if the inferior Degrees were the <hi>Clergy,</hi> the Bishops would be the Church:
altho that word in the Scripture-sense, is proper only to a Congregation of
the Faithful. And being by that title the only Men in Ecclesiastical Councils,
then when they were once assembled, they were the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> and,
having the Holy Spirit at their Devotion, whatsoever Creed they light upon,
that was the <hi>Catholick Faith, without the believing of which, no Man can be saved.</hi>
By which means there rose thenceforward so constant Persecutions till this
day, that, had not the little invisible <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> and a People that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
search'd and believ'd the Scriptures, made a stand by their Testimonies
and Sufferings, the Creeds had destroy'd the Faith, and the Church had ruined
the Religion. For this General Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> and all others of the same con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,
did, and can serve to no other end or effect, than a particular order
of Men by their usurping a trust upon Christianity, to make their own Price
and Market of it, and deliver it up as oft as they see their own advantage.</p>
            <p>For scarce was <hi>Constantine</hi>'s Head cold, but his Son <hi>Constantius,</hi> succeeding
his Brothers, being influenced by the Bishops of the <hi>Arrian</hi> Party, turn'd
the wrong side of Christianity outward, inverted the Poles of Heaven, and

Faith (if I may say so) with its Heels in the Air, was forced to stand upon
its Head, and play Gambols, for the Divertisement and Pleasure of the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moieusians.
Arrianism</hi> was the Divinity then in Mode, and he was an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
and ill Courtier, or Church-man, that could not dress, and would not
make a new Sute for his Conscience in the Fashion. And now the Orthodox
Bishops (it being given to those Men to be obstinate for Power, but flexible
in Faith) began to wind about insensibly, as the <hi>Heliotrope Flower</hi> that keeps
its ground, but wrests its neck in turning after the warm Sun, from day-break
to evening. They could look now upon the Synod of <hi>Nice</hi> with more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference,
and all that pudder that had been made there betwixt <hi>Homoousius</hi>
and <hi>Homoiousius,</hi> &amp;c. began to appear to them <hi>as a Difference only arising from
the Inadequation of Languages:</hi> Till by degrees they were drawn over, and
rather than lose their Bishopricks, would join, and at last be the head-most in
the Persecution of their own former Party. But the Deacons, to be sure,
that steer'd the Elephants, were thorow-paced; Men to be reckon'd and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied
upon in this or any other occasion, and would prick on, to render them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
capable and Episcopable, upon the first Vacancy. For now the <hi>Arrians</hi>
in grain, scorning to come behind the Clownish <hi>Homoousians,</hi> in an Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
Civility, were resolved to give them their full of Persecution. And it
seem'd a piece of Wit rather than Malice, to pay them in their own Coin, and
to <hi>Burlesque</hi> them in earnest, by the repetition and heightning of the same Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verities
upon them, that they had practised upon others. Had you the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moousians</hi>
a Creed at <hi>Nice?</hi> we will have another Creed for you at <hi>Ariminum,</hi>
and at <hi>Selucia.</hi> Would you not be content with so many several Projects of
Faith consonant to Scripture, unless you might thrust the new word <hi>Homoou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sios</hi>
down our Throats, and then tear it up again, to make us confess it? Tell
us the word, ('twas <hi>Homoiousios</hi>) we are now upon the Guard, or else we
shall run you thorow. Would you Anathemize, Banish, Imprison, Execute
us, and burn our Books? You shall taste of this Christian Fare, and as you
relish it, you shall have more on't provided. And thus it went, <hi>Arrianism</hi>
being Triumphant, but the few sincere and stomachful Bishops, adhering con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly,
and with a true Christian Magnanimity, especially <hi>Athanasius,</hi> thorow
all Sufferings, unto their former Confessions, expiated so in some measure,
what they had committed in the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sozomen,</hi> 1. 4. c. 25. first tells us a Story of <hi>Eudoxius,</hi> who succeeded <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donius,</hi>
in the Bishoprick of <hi>Constantinople;</hi> that in the Cathedral of <hi>Sancta So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia</hi>
being mounted in his Episcopal Throne, the first time that they Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
for its Dedication, in the very beginning of his Sermon to the People
(those things were already come in Fashion) told them: <hi>Patrem impium esse,
Filium autem pium;</hi> at which then they began to bustle; <hi>Pray be quiet,</hi> saith
he; I say, <hi>Patrem impium esse, quia Colit neminem, Filium vero Pium quia colit
Patrem;</hi> at which they then laughed as heartily, as before they were Angry.
But this I only note to this purpose, that there were some of the greatest Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
among the <hi>Homoiousians,</hi> as well as the <hi>Homoousians,</hi> that could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:101402:15"/>
one anothers Simplicity, and that it was not impossible for the <hi>Many</hi> to
be wiser and more Orthodox than the <hi>Few,</hi> in Divine matters. That which
I cite him for as most Material, is, the Remark upon the Imposition then of
Contrary Creeds: <hi>Which verily,</hi> saith he, <hi>was plainly the beginning of most
great Calamities, forasmuch as hereupon there followed a Disturbance, not unlike
those which we before recited over the whole Empire; and likewise a Persecution
equal almost to that of the Heathen Emperors, seized upon all of all Churches. For
although it seemed to some more gentle, for what concerns the torture of the body, yet
to prudent persons it appeared more bitter and severe, by reason of the Dishonour and
Ignominy. For both they who stirred up, and those that were afflicted with this Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution,
were of the Christian Church; and the grievance therefore was the greater
and more ugly, in that the same things which are done among Enemies, were Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
between those of the same Tribe and Profession: But the holy Law forbids us
to carry our selves in that manner, even to those that are without, and Aliens.</hi> And
all this mischief sprung from making of Creeds, with which the Bishops, as
it were at <hi>Tilting,</hi> aim'd to hit one another in the Eye, and throw the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
Party out of the Saddle. But if it chanced that the weaker side were ready
to yield, (for what sort of Men was there that could better manage, or had
their Consciences more at command at that time than the Clergy?) Then the
<hi>Arrians</hi> would use a yet longer, thicker, and sharper Lance for the purpose,
(for there were never Vacancies sufficient) that they might be sure to run
them down, over, and thorow, and do their Business. The Creed of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum</hi>
was now too short for the Design; but, saith the Historian, they affix'd
<hi>further Articles like Labels to it, pretending to have made it better, and so sent it
thorow the Empire with</hi> Constantius <hi>his Proclamation, that whoever would not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
it, should be Banished.</hi> Nay, they would not admit their own beloved
<hi>Similis Substantia;</hi> but to do the work throughly, the <hi>Arrians</hi> renounc'd
their own Creed for Malice, and made it an Article; <hi>Filium Patri tam substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,
quam Voluntate, Dissimilem esse.</hi> But this is a small matter with any of
them, provided thereby they may do Service to the Church, that is their Party.
So that one (seriously speaking) that were really Orthodox, could not then
defend the Truth or himself, but by turning of <hi>Arrian,</hi> if he would impugn
the new ones; such was the Subtilty. What shall I say more? As the Arts of
Glass Coaches and Perriwigs illustrate this Age, so by their Trade of Creed-making,
then first invented, we may esteem the Wisdom of <hi>Constantine</hi>'s, and
<hi>Constantius</hi> his Empire. And in a short space, as is usual among Tradesmen,
where it appears gainful, they were so many that set up of the same Profession,
that they could scarce live by one another. <hi>Socr. 1. 2. c.</hi> 32. Therefore uses
these words. <hi>But now that I have</hi> tandem aliquando, <hi>run through this Labyrinth
of so many Creeds, I will gather up their number:</hi> And so reckons Nine Creeds
more, besides that of <hi>Nice,</hi> before the death of <hi>Constantine,</hi> (a blessed Number.)
And I believe I could for a need, make them up a dozen, if Men have a mind
to buy them so. And hence it was that <hi>Hilary,</hi> then Bishop of <hi>Poictiers,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents
that state of the Church pleasantly, yet sadly, <hi>Since the</hi> Nicene <hi>Synod,</hi>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                  <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>

               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:101402:17"/>
saith he, <hi>we do nothing but write Creeds. That while we fight about words,
whilst we raise Questions about Novelties, while we Quarrel about things doubtful,
and about Authors, while we contend in Parties, while there is difficulty in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
while we Anathematize one another, there is none now almost that is</hi> Christ's.
<hi>What a Change there is in the last years Creed? The first Decree commands that</hi>
Homoousios <hi>should not be mentioned. The next does again Decree and Publish</hi>
Homoousios. <hi>The third does by Indulgence excuse the Word</hi> Ousia, <hi>as used by the
Fathers in their simplicity. The fourth does not Excuse, but Condemn it. It is
come to that at last, that nothing among us, or those before us, can remain sacred
or inviolable. We Decree every year of the Lord, a new Creed concerning God;
Nay, every Change of the Moon our Faith is alter'd. We repent of our Decrees,
we defend those that repent of them; we Anathematize those that we defended; and
while we either condemn other Mens Opinions in our own, or our own Opinions in
those of other Men, and bite at one another, we are now all of us torn in pieces.</hi>
This Bishop sure was the Author of <hi>the Naked Truth,</hi> and 'twas he that <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitely
condemn'd the whole Catholick Church, both</hi> East <hi>and</hi> West, <hi>for being
too presumptuous in her Definitions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is not strange to me, that <hi>Iulian,</hi> being but a Reader in the Christian
Church, should turn <hi>Pagan:</hi> Especially when I consider that he suceeded
Emperor after <hi>Constantius.</hi> For it seems rather unavoidable that a man of
great Wit, as he was, and not having the Grace of God to direct it, and show
him the Beauty of Religion, through the Deformity of its Governours and
Teachers; but that he must conceive a Loathing and Aversion for it, Nor
could he think that he did them any Injustice, when he observed that, beside
all their Unchristian Immorality too, they practised thus against the Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutive
Law of their <hi>Galilean,</hi> the Persecution among themselves for Religion.
And well might he add to his other Severities, that sharpness of his Wit,
both <hi>Exposing</hi> and <hi>Animadverting</hi> upon them, at another rate than any of the
Modern Practitioners with all their study and Inclination, can ever arrive at.
For nothing is more punishable, Contemptible, and truly Ridiculous, than a
Christian that walks contrary to his Profession: And by how much any man
stands with more advantage in the Church for Eminency, but disobeys the
Laws of <hi>Christ</hi> by that priviledge, he is thereby, and deserves to be the
more Exposed. But <hi>Iulian,</hi> the last Heathen Emperor, by whose cruelty it
seemed that God would sensibly admonish once again the Christian Clergy,
and show them by their own smart, and an Heathen-hand, the nature and
odiousness of Persecution, soon died, as is usual for Men of that Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
not without a remarkable stroke of Gods Judgement.</p>
            <p>Yet they, as they were only sorry that they had lost so much time, upon his
death strove as eagerly to redeem it, and forthwith fell in very <hi>naturally</hi> into
their former Animosities. For <hi>Iovianus</hi> being chosen Emperor in <hi>Persia,</hi> and
returning homeward, <hi>Socr.</hi> 1. 3. c. 20. The Bishops of each party, in hopes that
theirs should be the Imperial Creed, strait took Horse, and rode away with
Switch and Spur, as if it had been for the Plate, to meet him; and he that
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:101402:17"/>
had best Heels, made himself cock-sure of winning the Religion. The <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donians,</hi>
who dividing from the <hi>Arrians,</hi> had set up for a new Heresie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Holy Ghost, (and they were a Squadron of Bishops) Petition'd
him that those who held, <hi>Filium Patri dissimilem,</hi> might be turn'd out, and
themselves put in their places: Which was very honestly done, and above-board.
The <hi>Acacians,</hi> that were the refined <hi>Arrians,</hi> but, as the Author saith,
<hi>Had a notable faculty of addressing themselves to the Inclination of whatsoever Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror,</hi>
and having good Inteligence that he balanced rather to the <hi>Consubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials,</hi>
presented him with a very fair Insinuating subscription, of a considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
number of Bishops to the Council of <hi>Nice.</hi> But in the next Emperors time
they will be found to yield little Reverence to their own Subscription. For
in matter of a Creed, a Note of their Hand, without expressing the Penalty,
could not it seems bind one of their Order. But all that <hi>Iovianus</hi> said to the
<hi>Macedonians,</hi> was; <hi>I hate Contention, but I lovingly embrace and reverence those
who are inclined to Peace and Concord.</hi> To the <hi>Acacians,</hi> who had wisely
given these the precedence of Application, to try the truth of their Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
he said no more (<hi>having resolv'd by sweetness and perswasions to quiet
all their Controversies</hi>) but, <hi>That he would not molest any man whatsoever Creed
he follow'd, but those above others he would Cherish and Honour, who should
show themselves most forward in bringing the Church to a good Agreement.</hi> He
likewise call'd back all those Bishops who had been Banish'd by <hi>Constantius,</hi>
and <hi>Iulian,</hi> restoring them to their Sees. And he writ a Letter in particular
to <hi>Athanasius,</hi> who upon <hi>Iulian</hi>'s death had enter'd again upon that of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria,</hi>
to bid him be of good courage. <hi>And these things coming to the Ears of
all others, did wonderfully asswage the Fierceness of those who were Inflamed
with Faction and Contention:</hi> So that, the Court having declared it self of this
Mind, the Church was in a short time in all outward appearance peaceably dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
the Emperor by this means having wholly repressed all their violence.
<hi>Verily,</hi> concludes the Historian, <hi>the</hi> Roman <hi>Empire had been prosperous and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
and both the State and the Church</hi> (he puts them too in that Order) <hi>under
so good a Prince, must have exceedingly flourished, had not an Immature death ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
him away from managing the Government. For after seven Months, being
seized with a mortal Obstruction, he departed this Life.</hi> Did not this Historian,
trow you, deserve to be handled, and is it not, <hi>now the Mischief is done, to
undo the Charm, oecome a</hi> Duty, <hi>to</hi> Expose both <hi>him</hi> and <hi>Iovianus? By their
ill chosen Principles, what would have become of the Prime and most necessary
Article of Faith? Might not the old Dormant Heresies, all of them safely have
Revived?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that <hi>Mortal Obstruction</hi> of the Bishops, was not by his death (nor is it
by their own to be) removed. They were glad he was so soon got out of their
way, and God would yet further manifest: their intractable Spirit, which not
the Persecution of the Heathen Emperor <hi>Iulian,</hi> nor the Gentleness of <hi>Iovia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
the Christian, could allay or mitigate by their Afflictions or Prosperity.
The Divine <hi>Nemesis</hi> executed Justice upon them, by one anothers hand:
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:101402:18"/>
And so hainous a Crime as for a Christian, a Bishop to Persecute, stood yet in
need, as the only equal and exemplary Punishment, of being reveng'd with a
Persecution by Christians, by Bishops. And whosoever shall seriously consider
all along the Successions of the Emperors, can never have taken that satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the most judicious Representations of the Scene, which he may in this
worthy Speculation of the great Order and admirable conduct of wise Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence;
through the whole contexture of these Exterior seeming Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
relating to the Ecclesiasticals of Christianity.</p>
            <p>For to <hi>Iovianus</hi> succeeded <hi>Valentinian,</hi> who in a short time took his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Valens</hi> to be his Companion in the Empire. These two Brothers did as
the Historian observes, <hi>Socr.</hi> l. 14. c. 1. (alike, and equally take care at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
for the advantage and government of the State) but very much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreed,
though both Christians, in matters of Religion: <hi>Valetinianus</hi> the Elder
being an <hi>Orthodox,</hi> but <hi>Valens</hi> an <hi>Arrian,</hi> and they used a different Method
toward the Christians. For <hi>Valentinian</hi> (who chose the western part of the
Empire, and left the East to his Brother) as he embraced those of his own
Creed, so yet he did not in the least molest the <hi>Arrians:</hi> But <hi>Valens</hi> not only
labor'd to increase the number of the <hi>Arrians,</hi> but afflicted those of the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Opinion with grievous Punishments. And both of 'm, especially <hi>Valens,</hi> had
Bishops for their purpose. The particulars of that heavy Persecution under
<hi>Valens,</hi> any one may further satisfie himself of in the Writers of those times:
And yet it is observable, that within a little space while he pursued the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox
Bishops, he gave Liberty to the <hi>Novatians,</hi> (who were of the same
Creed, but separated from them, as I have said, upon Discipline, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) and
caused their Churches, which for a while were shut up, to be opened again at
<hi>Constantinople.</hi> To be short, <hi>Valens</hi> (who out-lived his Brother, that died of a
natural Death) himself in a Battel against the <hi>Goths,</hi> could not escape neither
the fate of a Christian Persecutor. <hi>For the</hi> Goths <hi>having made application to
him, he,</hi> saith Socrates, <hi>not well fore-seeing the Consequence, admitted them to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit
in certain places of</hi> Thracia, <hi>pleasing himself that he should by that means al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
have an Army ready at hand against whatsoever Enemies; and that those Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Guards would strike them with a greater Terror, more by far than the</hi> Militia <hi>of
his Subjects. And so slighting the ancient Veterane</hi> Militia, <hi>which used to consist
of Bodies of Men, raised proportionably in every Province, and were stout Fellows
that would Fight Manfully; instead of them he levied Money, rating the Country
at so much for every Souldier.</hi> But these new Inmates of the Emperors soon
grew Troublesom, as is customary, and not only infested the Natives in
<hi>Thracia,</hi> but Plunder'd even the Suburbs of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> there being no Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Force to repress them: Hereupon the whole People of the City cried out
at a publick Spectacle, where <hi>Valens</hi> was present neglecting this matter, <hi>Give
us Arms and we will manage this War our selves.</hi> This extreamly provok'd him,
so that he forthwith made an Expedition against the <hi>Goths:</hi> But <hi>Threatned
the</hi> Citizens <hi>if he return'd in safety, to be Reveng'd on them both for those Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumelies,
and for what under the Tyrant</hi> Procopius, <hi>they had committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:101402:18"/>
the Empire; and that he would Raze to the Ground, and Plow up the City.
Yet before his departure out of the fear of the Foraign Enemy, he totally ceas'd from
persecuting the Orthodox in</hi> Constantinople. <hi>But he was kill'd in the Fight, or
Flying into a Village that the</hi> Goths <hi>had set on fire, he was burnt to ashes,</hi> to the
great grief of his Bishops; who, had he been Victorious, might have revived
the Persecution. Such was the end of his Impetuous Reign and rash Counsels,
both as to his Government of State, in matters of Peace and War, and his
Manage of the Church by Persecution.</p>
            <p>His death brings me to the Succession of <hi>Theodosius</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> than whom no
Christian Emperor did more make it his business to Nurse up the Church, and
to Lull the Bishops, to keep the House in quiet. But neither was it in his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to still their Bawling, and Scratching one another, as far as their Nails
(which were yet more tender, but afterwards grew like Tallons) would give
them leave. I shall not further vex the History, or the Reader, in recounting
the particulars; taking no delight neither my self in so uncomfortable Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
or to reflect beyond what is necessary upon the Wolfishness of those
which then seemed, and ought to have been the Christian Pastors, but went on
scattering their Flocks, if not devouring; and the Shepherds smiting one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
In his Reign, the second General Council was called, that of <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi>
and the Creed was there made, which took its name from the place:
The rest of their business, any one that is further curious, may observe in the
Writers. But I shall close this with a short touch concerning <hi>Gregory Nazian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen,</hi>
then living, than whom also the Christian Church had not in those times
(and I question whether in any succeeding) a Bishop that was more a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
more a Getleman, better appointed in all sorts of Learning requisite,
seasoned under <hi>Iulian</hi>'s Persecution, and exemplary to the highest pitch of
true Religion, and Practical Piety. The eminence of these Vertues, and in
special of his Humility (the lowliest, but the highest of all Christian Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions)
raised him under <hi>Theodosius,</hi> from the Parish-like Bishoprick of <hi>Nazian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zum,</hi>
to that of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> where he fill'd his place in that Council. But
having taken notice in what manner things were carried in that, as they had
been in former Councils, and that some of the Bishops muttered at his promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
he of his own mind resigned that great Bishoprick, whis was never of
his desire or seeking; and, though so highly seated in the Emperors Reverence
and Favor, so acceptable to the People, and generally to the Clergy, whose un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal
Abilities could not pretend or justifie an envy against him; retired back
for more content, to a Solitary Life, to his little <hi>Nazianzum.</hi> And from
thence he writes that Letter to his Friend <hi>Procopius,</hi> wherein. p. 418. upon
his most recollected and serious reflexion on what had faln within his obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
he useth these remarkable words: <hi>I have resolved with my self (if I may
tell you the</hi> Naked <hi>Truth,) never more to come into any Assembly of Bishops: for I
never saw a good and happy end of any Council, but which rather increased than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medied
the mischiefs. For their obstinate Contentions and Ambition are unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:101402:19"/>
It would require too great a Volume to deduce, from the death of <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius,</hi>
the particulars that happened in the succeeding Reigns about this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
But the Reader may reckon that it was as stated a Quarrel betwixt the
<hi>Homoousians,</hi> and the <hi>Homoiousians,</hi> as that between the Houses of <hi>York</hi> and
<hi>Lancaster:</hi> And there arose now an Emperor of one Line, and then again of
the other. But among all the Bishops, there was not one <hi>Morton,</hi> whose <hi>indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious
Brain could or would</hi> (for some Men always reap by Division) <hi>make up
the fatal Breach betwixt</hi> the two Creeds. By this means every Creed was grown
up to a Test, and under that pretence, the dextrous Bishops step by step hook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
within their Verge, all the business and Power that could be catched in
those Turbulences, where they mudled the Water, and Fished after. By this
means they stalked on first to a Spiritual kind of Dominion, and from that
incroached upon and into the Civil Jurisdiction. A Bishop now grew terrible,
and (whereas a simple Layman might have frighted the Devil with the first
words of the Apostles Creed, and <hi>I defie thee Satan</hi>) one Creed could not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
him from a Bishop, and it required a much longer, and a double and
treble Confession, unless himself would be delivered over to <hi>Satan</hi> by an <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema.</hi>
But this was only an Ecclesiastical sentence at first, with which they
marked out such as sinned against them, and then whoop'd and hallow'd on
the Civil Magistrate, to hunt them down for their Spiritual Pleasure. They
crept at first by Court Insinuations &amp; Flattery into the Princes favor, till those
generous Creatures suffered themselves to be backed &amp; ridden by them, who
would take as much of a free Horse as possible: But in Persecution the Clergy
as yet, wisely interposed the Magistrate betwixt themselves &amp; the People, not
caring so their end were attained, how odious they rendred him: And you
may observe that for the most part hitherto, they stood crouching &amp; shot ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
over the Emperors back, or under his belly. But in process of time they
became bolder and open-fac'd, and Persecuted before the Sun at Mid-day. Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
grew worse, but Bishopricks every day better and better. There was
now no <hi>Eusebius</hi> left to refuse the Bishopcick of <hi>Antiochia,</hi> whom therefore
<hi>Constantine</hi> told, <hi>That he deserv'd the Bishoprick of the whole World for that
Modesty.</hi> They were not such Fools as <hi>Ammonius Parates,</hi> I warrant you,
in the time of <hi>Theodosius. He,</hi> Socr. <hi>l. 6. c. 30. being seised upon by some that
would needs make him a Bishop, when he could not perswade them to the contrary,
cut off one of his Ears, telling them that now should he himself desire to be a
Bishop, he was by the Law of Priesthood incapable: but when they observed that
those things only obliged the</hi> Jewish <hi>Priesthood, and that the Church of</hi> Christ
<hi>did not consider whether a Priest were sound or perfect in limb of Body, but only
that he were intire in his manners; they return'd to seize on him again: But
when he saw them coming, he swore with a solemn Oath, that if, to Consecrate
him a Bishop, they laid violent hands upon him, he would cut out his tongue also;
whereupon they fearing he would do it, desisted.</hi> What should have been the
matter, that a man so Learned and Holy, should have such an aversion to be
promoted in his own Order; that, rather than yield to be a Compelled or
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:101402:19"/>
Compelling Bishop, he would inflict upon himself as severe a Martyrdom, as
any Persecutor could have done for him? Sure he saw something more in the
very Constitution, than some do at present. But this indeed was an Example
too Rigid, and neither fit to have been done, nor to be imitated, as there was
no danger. For far from this they followed the precedent rather of <hi>Damasus</hi>
and <hi>Vrsinus,</hi> which last, <hi>Socr.</hi> l. 4 c. 24. <hi>in</hi> Valentinian'<hi>s time, perswaded
certain obscure and abject Bishops</hi> (for there were it seems of all sorts and sizes)
<hi>to create him Bishop in a Corner, and then</hi> (so early) <hi>he and</hi> Damasus, who was
much the better Man, waged War for the Bishoprick of <hi>Rome,</hi> to the great
scandal of the <hi>Pagan</hi> Writers, who made Remarks for this and other things
upon their Christianity, and to the Bloodshed and Death of a multitude of the
Christian People. But this last I mention'd, only as a weak and imperfect
Essay in that time, of what it came to in the several Ages after, which I am
now speaking of, when the Bishops were given, gave themselves over to all
manner of Vice, Luxury, Pride, Ignorance, Superstition, Covetousness, and
Monopolizing of all secular Imployments and Authority. Nothing could
escape them: They meddled, troubled themselves and others, with many
things, every thing, forgetting that <hi>one, only needful.</hi> Insomuch that I could
not avoid wondring often, that among so many Churches that with Paganick
Rites they dedicated to Saint <hi>Mary,</hi> I have met with none to Saint <hi>Martha.</hi>
But above all, Imposition and Cruelty became inherent to them, and the
power of Persecution was grown so good and desirable a thing, that they
thought the Magistrate scarce worthy to be trusted with it longer, and a meer
Novice at it, and either wrested it out of his hands, or gently eased him of
that and his other burdens of Government. The sufferings of the Laity were
become the Royalties of the Clergy; and, being very careful Christians, the
Bishops that not a word of our Saviour might fall to the ground, because he
had foretold how men should be persecuted for his Names sake, they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
to see it done effectually in their own Provinces, and out of pure zeal
of doing him the more Service of this kind, inlarged studiously their Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses
beyond all proportion. Like <hi>Nostrodamus</hi> his Son, that to fulfil his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
prediction of a City in <hi>France,</hi> that should be burned; with his own
hands set it on fire. All the Calamities of the Christian world in those Ages,
may be derived from them, while they warm'd themselves at the Flame; and
like Lords of Misrule, kept a perpetual <hi>Christmas.</hi> What in the Bishops name
is the matter? How it came about that Christianity, which approved it self
under all Persecutions to the Heathen Emperors, and merited their favour so
far, till at last it regularly succeeded to the Monarchy, should under those
of their own Profession be more distressed? Were there some Christians then
too, that feared still lest Men should be Christians, and for whom <hi>it was
necessary,</hi> not for the Gospel reason <hi>that there should be Heresies.</hi> Let us col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
a little now also in the conclusion what at first was not <hi>particulariz'd,</hi> how
the reason of State and Measure of Government stood under the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours,
in aspect to them. I omit <hi>Tiberius,</hi> mention'd in the beginning of this
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:101402:20"/>
Essay. <hi>Trajane,</hi> after having persecuted them, and having used <hi>Pliny</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
in his Province to that purpose, upon his relation that they lived in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
to all Law, but that which forbad their Worship, and in all other
things were blameless, and good men, straitly by his Edict commanded that
none of them should be farther enquired after. <hi>Hadrian,</hi> in his Edict to <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutius
Fundanus,</hi> Proconsul of <hi>Asia,</hi> commands him that, <hi>If any accuse the
Christians, and can prove it, that they commit any thing against the State, that then
he punish them according to the crime: but if any man accuse them, meerly for ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny
and vexation, as Christians, then i'faith let him suffer for't, and take you
care that he feel the smart of it. Antoninus Pius</hi> writ his Edict very remarkable,
if there were place to recite it, to the States of <hi>Asia</hi> Assembled at <hi>Ephesus,</hi>
wherein he takes notice of his Fathers command, that <hi>unless the Christians were
found to act any thing against the</hi> Roman <hi>Empire, they should not be molested,</hi> and
then commands, <hi>that if any man thereafter shall continue to trouble them,</hi> tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam
tales, <hi>as Christians, for their Worship, in that case, he that is the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
should be exposed to punishment, but the Accused should be free and discharged.</hi>
I could not but observe that among other things in this Edict, where he is
speaking. <hi>It is desirable to them that they may appear, being accused, more willing
to die for their God than to live:</hi> He adds, <hi>It would not be amiss to admonish you
concerning the Earth-quakes which have, and do now happen, that when you are
afflicted at them, you would compare our affairs with theirs. They are thereby so
much the more incouraged to a confidence and reliance upon God, but you all the
while go on in your ignorance, and neglect both other gods, and the Religion towards
the immortal, and banish and persecute them unto death.</hi> Which words of that
Emperors, fall in so naturally with what, it seems, was a common observation
about Earth-quakes, that I cannot but to that purpose take further notice,
how also <hi>Gregory Nazianzen,</hi> in Or. 2. <hi>contra Gentiles,</hi> tells, besides the breakings
in of the Sea in several places, and many fires that happened, of the Earth-quakes
in particular, which he reckons as Symptoms of <hi>Iulian</hi>'s Persecution.
And to this I may add, <hi>Socr.</hi> l. 3. <hi>c.</hi> 10, who in the Reign of <hi>Valens,</hi> that notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Christian Persecutor, saith, at the same time there was an Earth-quake in
<hi>Bithynia,</hi> which turned the City of <hi>Nice</hi> (that same in which the general Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
was held under <hi>Constantine</hi>) and a little after there was another. <hi>But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
these so happened, the minds of</hi> Valens, <hi>and of</hi> Eudoxius, <hi>the Bishop of the</hi>
Arrians, <hi>were not all stirred up unto Piety, and a right opinion of Religion.</hi> For <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless
they ceased not, made no end of persecuting those who in their Creed dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
from them. Those Earth-quakes seemed to be certain indications of tumults
in the Church.</hi> All which put together, could not but make me reflect upon
the late Earth-quakes, great by how much more unusual here in <hi>England,</hi>
thorow so many Counties two years since, at the same time when the Clergy,
some of them, were so busie in their Cabals, to promote this (I would give it
a modester name than) Persecution, which is now on foot against the Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
at so unseasonable a time, and upon no occasion administred by them,
that those who comprehend the reasons, yet cannot but wonder at the wisdom
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:101402:20"/>
of it. Yet I am not neither one of the most credulous nickers or appliers of
natural events to human transanctions: But neither am I so secure as the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Dr. <hi>Spencer,</hi> nor can walk along the world without having some eye to
the conjunctures of God's admirable Providence. Neither was <hi>Marcus Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi>
(that I may return to my matter) negligent as to the particular. But he,
observing, as <hi>Antonnius</hi> had the Earth-quakes, that in an expedition against
the <hi>Germans</hi> and <hi>Sarmatians,</hi> his Army being in despair almost for want of
water, the <hi>Melitine</hi> (afterwards from the event called the <hi>Thundring</hi>) Legion,
which consisted of Christians, kneel'd down in the very heat of their thirst and
fight, praying for rain; which posture the Enemies wondring at, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
there brake out such a thundring and lightning, as together with the
Christian valour, routed the adverse Army, but so much rain fell therewith,
as refreshed <hi>Aurelius</hi> his Forces, that were at the last gasp for thirst: He thence
forward commanded by his Letters, <hi>That upon pain of death none should inform
against the Christians,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his Apology for the Christians witnesses.
But who would have believed that even <hi>Commodus,</hi> so great a Tyrant other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
should have been so favourable as to make a Law, <hi>That the Informers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Christians should be punished with death?</hi> Yet he did, and the Informer
against <hi>Apollonius</hi> was by it executed. Much less could a man have thought
that, that prodigy of cruelty <hi>Maximine,</hi> and who exercised it so severely upon
the Christians, should, as he did, being struck with God's hand, publish when
it was too late Edict after Edict, in great favour of the Christians. But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all, nothing could have been less expected than that, after those Heathen
Emperors, the first Christian <hi>Constantine</hi> should have been seduced by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
to be after them, the first occasion of Persecution, so contrary to his
own excellent inclination: 'Twas then that he spake his own mind, when he
said, <hi>Eus.</hi> de vitâ <hi>Const. 69. You ought to retain within the bounds of your pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
thoughts of those things, which you cunningly and subtly seek out concerning most
frivolous questions.</hi> And then much plainer, <hi>c.</hi> 67. where he saith so wisely.
<hi>You are not ignorant that the Philosophers all of them do agree in the profession of the
same Discipline, but do oftentimes differ in some part of the Opinions that they dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matize
in: But yet, although they do dissent about the Discipline that each several
Sect observeth, they nevertheless reconcile themselves again for the sake of that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Profession to which they have concurred.</hi> But again compulsion in Religious.
matters so much every where, that it is needless to insert one passage. And
he being of this disposition, and universally famous for his care and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of the Christian Religion. <hi>Eusebius</hi> saith these words, <hi>While the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God did glory and heighten it self in the doing of good things, and all fear
from without was taken away, and the Church was fortifi'd as I may say, on all sides
by a peaceable and illustrious tranquility, then Envy lying in wait against our prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
craftily crept in, and began first to dance in the midst of the company of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops;</hi>
so goes on, telling the History of <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Arrius.</hi> I have been
before large enough in that relation, wherein appeared that, contrary to
that great Emperours pious intention, whereas <hi>Envy began to dance among the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:101402:21"/>
Bishops first,</hi> the good <hi>Constantine</hi> brought them the Fiddles. But it appear'd
likewise how soon he was weary of the Ball, and toward his latter end, as
Princes often do upon too late experience, would have repressed all, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to his natural temper. Of the other Christian Emperours I likewise
discoursed, omitting, that I might insert it in this place, how the great Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
Philosopher <hi>Themistius,</hi> in his Consolar Oration, celebrated <hi>Iovianus</hi> for
having given that toleration in Christien Religion, and thereby defeated the
<hi>flattering</hi> Bishops, which sort of men, saith he wittily, <hi>do not worship God,
but the Imperial Purple.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was the same <hi>Themistius,</hi> that only out of an upright natural apprehension
of things, made that excellent Oration afterward to <hi>Valens,</hi> which is in Print,
exhorting him to cease Persecution; wherein he chances upon, and improves
the same notion with <hi>Constantines,</hi> and tells him, <hi>That he should not wonder at
the Dissents in Cstristian Religion, which were very small if compared with the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
and crowd of Opinions among the Gentile Philosophers; for there were at least
three hundred differences, and a very great dissention among them there was about
their resolutions, unto which each several Sect was as it were, necessarily bound up
and obliged: And that God seemed to intend more to illustrate his own glory by that
diverse and unequal variety of Opinions, to the end every each one might therefore so
much the more reverence his Divine Majesty, because it is not possible for any one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curately
to know him.</hi> And this had a good effect upon <hi>Valens,</hi> for the mitiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in some measure his severities against his fellow Christians. So that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
having cast about in this Summery again, (whereby it plainly appears, that
according to natural right, and the apprehension of all sober Heathen Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
Christianity as a Religion, was wholly exempt from the Magistrates
jurisdiction or Laws, farther than any particular person among them immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
transgressed, as others, the common rules of human society) I cannot
but return to the Question with which I begun. What was the matter? How
came it about that Christianity, which approved it self under all Persecutions
to the Heathen Emperours, and merited their favour so far, till at last it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly
succeeded to the Monarchy, should under those of their own profession,
be more distressed? But the Answer is now much shorter and certainer, and I
will adventure boldly to say, the true and single cause then was the Bishops.
And they were the cause against reason. For what power had the Emperours
by growing Christians, more than those had before them? None. What ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
were Christians Subject under to the Magistrate more than before?
None. But the Magistrates Christian Authority was what the Apostle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd
it while Heathen; <hi>not to be a terror to good works, but to evil.</hi> What new
Power had the Bishops acquired, whereby they turned every <hi>Pontificate</hi> into a
<hi>Caiaphat?</hi> None neither, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 8. Had they been Apostles. <hi>The Lord
had but given them Authority for edification, not for destruction.</hi> They, of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
ought to have Preached to the Magistrate the terrible denunciations in
Scripture against usurping upon, and persecuting of Christians. They, of all
others, ought to have laid before them the horrible Examples of God's ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:101402:21"/>
Justice against those that exercised Persecution. But, provided they
could be the Swearers of the Prince, to do all due Allegiance to the Church,
and to preserve the Rights and Liberties of the Church, however they came
by them, they would give them as much scope as he pleased, in matter of
Christianity, and would be the first to solicite him to break the Laws of <hi>Christ,</hi>
and ply him with hot places of Scripture, in order to all manner of Oppression
and Persecution in Civils and Spirituals. So that the whole business how this
unchristian Tyranny came, and could entitle it self among Christians, against
the Christian priviledges, was only the case in <hi>Zech. 13. 6. 7. And one shall
say unto him, What are these wounds in thy hands? Then he shall answer, those
with which I was wounded in the house of my Friends.</hi> Because they were all
Christians, they thought forsooth they might make the bolder with them,
make bolder with Christ, and wound him again in the hands and feet of his
members. Because they were Friends, they might use them more coarsly,
and abuse them against all common civility, in their own house, which is a
Protection to Strangers. And all this to the end that a Bishop might sit with
the Prince in <hi>Iunto,</hi> to consult wisely how to preserve him from those people
that never meant him any harm, and to secure him from the Sedition and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
of men that seek, nor think any thing more, but to follow their own
Religious Christian Worship. It was indeed as ridiculous a thing to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans
to see that work, as it was afterwards in <hi>England</hi> to Strangers, where
Papists and Protestants went both to wrack at the same instant, in the same
Market; and when <hi>Erasmus</hi> said wittily, <hi>Quid agitur in Angliâ? (Consulitur,</hi>
he might have added, though not so elegantly, <hi>Comburitur) de Religione.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they knew that Christian Worship was free by Christs Institution, they
procured the Magistrate to make Laws in it concerning things necessary: As
the Heathen Persecutor <hi>Iulian</hi> introduced some bordering Pagan Ceremonies,
and arguing with themselves in the same manner, as he did, <hi>Soz.</hi> l. 5. c. 16.
That <hi>if Christians should obey those Laws, they should be able to bring them about
to something further, which they had designed. But if they would not, then they
might proceed against them without any hope of pardon, as breakers of the Laws of
the Empire, and represent them as turbulent and dangerous to the Government.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
whatsoever the Animadverter saith of the Act of Seditious Conventicles
here in <hi>England,</hi> as if it were Anvill'd after another of the <hi>Roman</hi> Senate; the
Christians of those Ages had all the finest tools of Persecution out of <hi>Iulian</hi>'s
Shop, and studied him then as curiously as some do now <hi>Machiavel.</hi> These
Bishops it was, who, because the Rule of Christ was incomparable with the
Power that they assumed, and the Vices they practised, had no way to render
themselves necessary or tolerable to Princes, but by making true Piety diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult,
by Innovating Laws to revenge themselves upon it, and by turning Make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates
between Prince and People, instilling dangers of which themselves were
the Authors. Hence it is, that having awakened this Jealousie once in the
Magistrate, against Religion, they made both the Secular and the Ecclesiastical
Government so uneasie to him, that most Princes began to look upon their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:101402:22"/>
as their Enemies, and to imagine a reason of State different from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
of their People; and therefore to weaken themselves by seeking unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
and grievous supports to their Authority. Whereas if men could have
refrain'd this cunning, and from thence forcible governing of Christianity,
leaving it to its own simplicity and due liberty, but causing them in all other
things to keep the Kings and Christs peace among themselves, and towards
others, all the ill that could have come of it, would have been, that such kind
of Bishops should have prov'd less implemental; but the good that must have
thence risen to the Christian Magistrate and the Church, then and ever after,
would have been inexpressible.</p>
            <p>But this discourse having run in a manner wholly upon the Imposition of
Creeds, may seem not to concern (and I desire that it may not reflect upon)
our Clergy, nor the Controversies which have so unhappily vex'd our Church
ever since the reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth unto this day. Only, if there might
be something pick'd out of it towards the Compromising of those differences
(which I have not from any performance of mine, the vanity to imagine) it
may have use as an Argument, <hi>a Majori ad Minus,</hi> their disputes having risen
only from that of Creeds, ours from the Imposition only of Ceremonies, which
are of much inferior consideration. Faith being necessary, but Ceremonies
Dispensable. Unless our Church should lay the same weight upon them, as
one did. <hi>This is the time of her settlement, that there is a Church at the end of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Mile, that the Soveraign Powers spread their wings to cover and protect her,
that Kings and Queens are her Nursing Fathers and Nursing Mothers, that she
hath stately Cathedrals;</hi> there be so many arguments now to make Ceremonies
Necessary, which may all be answered with one Question that they use to ask
Children: <hi>Where are you proud?</hi> But I should rather hope from the Wisdom
and Christianity of the present guides of our Church, that they will (after an
age and more, after so long a time almost as those Primitive Bishops I have
spoke of, yet suffered the <hi>Novatian</hi> Bishops in every Diocess) have mercy on
the Nation that hath been upon so slender a matter as the Ceremonies and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy
so long, so miserably harass'd. That they will have mercy upon the
King, whom they know against his natural inclination, his Royal Intention,
his many Declarations, they have induced to more Severities then all the reigns
since the Conquest will contain, if summ'd up together; who may, as <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi>
among his Private Devotions put up one Collect to the Bishops, <hi>Euseb.</hi>
de vitâ <hi>Const. 7. 70. Date igitur mihi Dies tranquillos &amp; Noctes curarum expertes.</hi>
And it runs thus almost altogether <hi>verbatim</hi> in that Historian<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Grant, most
merciful Bishop and Priest that I may have calm days, and nights free from care
and molestation, that I may live a peaceable life in all Godliness and Holiness for the
future by your good agreement; which unless you vouchsafe me, I shall wast away
my Reign in perpetual sadness and vexation. For as long as the People of God
stands divided by so unjust and pernicious a Contention, how can it be that I can have
any ease in my own Spirit. Open therefore by your good agreement the way to me,
that I may continue my Expedition towards the East; and grant that I may see both
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:101402:22"/>
you and all the rest of my People, having laid aside your animosities, rejoycing toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that we may all with one voice give lund and glory, for the common and good
agreement and liberty, to God Almighty for ever,</hi> Amen. But if neither the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
nor his Majesty enter into their consideration. I hope it is no unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
request that they will be merciful unto themselves, and have some reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
at least for the <hi>Naked Truth</hi> of History, which either in their own times
will meet with them, or in the next Age overtake them: That they, who are
some of them so old, that as Confessors, they were the Scars of the former
troubles, others of them so young, that they are free from all the Motives of
Revenge and hatred, should yet joyn in reviving the former persecutions upon
the same pretences; yea, even themselves in a turbulent, military, and uncano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical
manner execute Laws of their own procuring, and depute their inferior
Clergy to be the Informers. I should rather hope to see not only that Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie
so scandalous abolished, but that also upon so good an occasion as the
Author of <hi>the Naked Truth</hi> hath administred them, they will inspect their
Clergy, and cause many things to be corrected, which are far more ruinous
in the Consequence than the dispensing with a Surplice. I shall mention some
too confusedly, as they occur to my Pen, at present, reserving much more for
better leisure. Methinks it might be of great edification, that those of them,
who have ample possessions, should be in a good sense, <hi>Multas inter opes inopes.</hi>
That they would inspect the Canons of the ancient Councils, where are many
excellent ones for the regulation of the Clergy. I saw one, looking but among
those of the same Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> against any Bishops removing from a less
Bishoprick to a greater, nor that any of the Inferior Clergy should leave a less
living for a fatter. That is methinks the most Natural use of General, or any
Councils to make Canons, as it were By-laws for the ordering of their own
Society; but they ought not to take out, much less forge any Patent to invade
and prejudice the Community. It were good that the greater Church-men
relyed more upon themselves, and their own direction, not building too
much upon Stripling Chaplains, that men may not suppose the Master (as one
that has a good Horse, or a fleet Hound) attributes to himself the vertues of
his Creature. That they inspect the Morals of the Clergy; the Moral Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
do the Church more harm than all the Non-conformists can do, or can
wish it. That before they admit men to subscribe the Thirty-nine Articles
for a Benefice, they try whether they know the meaning. That they would
much recommend to them the reading of the Bible. 'Tis a very good Book,
and if a man read it carefully, will make him much wiser. That they would
advise them to keep the Sabbath: If there were no Morality in the day, yet
there is a great deal of Prudence in the observing it. That they would instruct
those that come for Holy Orders and Livings, that it is a terrible Vocation they
enter upon; but that has indeed the greatest reward. That to gain a Soul is
beyond all the acquists of Traffick, and to Convert an Atheist, more glorious
than all the Conquests of the Souldier. That betaking themselves to this
Spiritual Warfare, they ought to disintangle from the World. That they do
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:101402:23"/>
not ride for a Benefice, as if it were for a Fortune, or a Mistress; but there
is more in it. That they take the Ministry up not as a Trade. That they make
them understand as well as they can, what is the grace of God. That they do
not come into the Pulpit too full of Fustian or Logick; a good life is a
Clergy-mans best Syllogism, and the quaintest Oratory; and till they out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live
'm, they will never get the better of the Fanaticks, nor be able to Preach
with Demonstration of Spirit, or with any effect or Authority. That they
be lowly minded, and no Railers.</p>
            <p>But these things require a greater Time, and to enumerate all that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss,
might perhaps be as endless as to number the People; nor are they
within the ordinary sphere of my Capacity.</p>
            <p>But to the Judicious and Serious Reader, to whom I wish any thing I have
said, may have given no unwelcome entertainment; I shall only so far justifie
my self, that I thought it no less concerned me to vindicate the Laity from the
Impositions that the <hi>Few</hi> would force upon them, than others to defend those
Impositions on behalf of the Clergy. But the Reverend Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> in his
<hi>Ecclesiastical Polity,</hi> says, The <hi>time will come when three words, uttered with Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and Meekness, shall receive a far more blessed reward, than three thousand Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes
written with disdainful sharpness of Wit.</hi> And I shall conclude.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I trust in the Almighty, that with us, Contentions are now at the highest float, and
that the day will come (for what cause is there of Despair</hi>) when <hi>the Passions of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
enmity being allaid, men shall with ten times redoubled tokens of unfainedly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
Love, shew themselves each to other the same which</hi> Joseph, <hi>and the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
of</hi> Joseph <hi>were at the time of their Enterview in</hi> Egypt. And upon this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
<hi>let my Book also</hi> (yea, my self if it were needful) <hi>be burnt by the hand of
those Enemies to the Peace and Tranquility of the Religion of</hi>
