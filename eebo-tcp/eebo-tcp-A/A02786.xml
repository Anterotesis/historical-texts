            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Sondry fearefull puniſhmentes by lightnings haue bin inflicted in many corners of this land, in this cleare light of the preaching of the goſpell, partly vpon <hi>Paules</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> and partly on other places of this realme.

(at which time <hi>France</hi> was ouerwhelmed with idolatry &amp; ſuperſtition) the citie of <hi>Claraualla</hi> being ſtricken with lightning about noone dayes did ſo fiercelie burne, that in three howers ſpace their town caſtles and churches were vtterly conſumed.

The conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereof moued me this preſent weeke to viſite the towne of <hi>Blechingley,</hi> being a towne not onely neare vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, but alſo hauing ſuch inhabitants, as vnto whome for many yeeres, for ſundrie kindneſſes I am much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden, when I came, I found their caſe to be equall (if not worſe) then the rumor or report, which was before publiſhed. I found that by the lightning (which came with the terrible thunder on Munday, being the 17. day of this inſtant Nouember, about ten of the clocke in the night) the Spire ſteeple of the ſaid <hi>Bleachingley,</hi> hauing beene lately new couered to the great charges of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
<pb facs="tcp:4105:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in three howers ſpace, was vtterly conſumed with fire. The ſteeple was but about twelue fadome high aboue the battlements of the ſquare ſtone worke: but it was a ſteeple ſpreading downeward very large in circumference. The ſtone worke which bare it (being alſo about twelue fadom high) is a long ſquare of one &amp; twenty feet one ſide, and eighteene feete the other ſide. It is thought by good workemen, that two hundred loades of timber will not ſuffice for the erecting of ſuch a ſteeple, as that ſtone-worke did lately beare.</p>
            <p>I found alſo the belles (being before a ſweet ring, and ſo large, that the Tenor waighed twenty hundred waight) partly melted into ſuch fragmentes, as may perhappes bee melted againe, and partly burnt into ſuch cinders, or intermingled with ſuch huge heapes of cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, as it will neuer hereafter ſerue to the former v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes thereof.</p>
            <p>Theſe grieuous loſſes are by diuerſe ſortes of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in ſundrie wayes interpreted. Some do account of them as a particular iudgement of God againſt the ſins of the inhabitantes of that towne of <hi>Blechingley.</hi> But I am not of their opinion, partly, becauſe, as I cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe the inhabitantes of the ſaid towne of ſundrie groſſe abuſes, ſo am I fully perſvvaded, a number of tovvnes neare adioyning to them, are in the like iniquities, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing inferiour to them, and partly, becauſe in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie of this fire vpon the church, the tovvne and tovvneſmen vvere miraculouſlie preſerued. The church ſtandeth in the Eaſt ende of the tovvne, and the vvinde (though it ſomtimes changed) yet it ſtill kept neare the vveſt point, &amp; droue the flame fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>vvard fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the houſes: A thatched barne, and certaine poore houſes neere ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyning to the Church, were ſo wonderfully preſerued, that we muſt needes confeſſe and acknowledge, that in the middeſt of iudgement there ſhined mercie. Some do deſcant vpon the day, becauſe the Bells did thus periſh in
<pb facs="tcp:4105:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that ſeuenteenth day of Nouember, wherein for ſo many former happie yeares they had ioyfully ſounded for the raigne of good Queene Elizabeth. But let ſuch know, that there needeth no other Bell, but onely a noble fame to ſound out the vertues of ſuch a learned and religious Queene: and that fame (maugre the deſpite of all aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries) muſt and will ring out her praiſes, euen vnto the endes of the world.</p>
            <p>If the Bells had beene caſt in our late Queenes raigne, then might the Papiſts picke occaſion to take ſome col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of aduantage.

            <p>The cauſe indeede why the lightning at this time did preuaile both againſt bels and ſteeple, was becauſe it was the good pleaſure of God, thus to ſhew his omnipotent power to ſtirre vp as wel the inhabitants of the ſaid town, as vs all, to feare him, &amp; to giue vs ſome taſte of his iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to ſummon vs all to true repentance.</p>

            <p>The lightning which is ſcattered more generally tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the aire, is of leſſe and weaker force, but that which is gathered into a leſſer compaſſe, is of greater ſtrength, and according to the ſeuerall effects hath ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry diuers names giuen vnto it.

               <pb facs="tcp:4105:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>The cauſes of the greiuous harmes which are often cauſed by lightnings, are of three ſorts, the firſt iudicial, the ſecond inſtructtiue: and the third fatidicall.</p>
            <p>The iudiciall cauſe is, when the Lord doth by it execute vengeance vpon ſome notable offenders, as vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on blaſphemers, vpon ſorcerers, vpon ambitious men, bloudſuckers,<note place="margin">Sabellinus &amp; Paulus Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conus.</note> drunkards, adulterers, and ſuch like, <hi>Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius</hi> an <hi>Arriau</hi> Biſhop when being at <hi>Carthage,</hi> he blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the bleſſed Trinity, he had by the iudgment of God his body ſuddenly burnt with lightning. So <hi>Sabellinus</hi> ſheweth a hiſtory of one <hi>Preſter</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Hippomanes,</hi> who blaſpheming God was ſtricken with a thunderbolt and periſhed.</p>
            <p>The thunderbolt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth of the viſcous &amp; ſulphurous matter of the lightning: for as the Gunners wildfires doe flame in the water, ſo lightnings (being much of the ſame nature) haue beene often ſeene to burne Fiſhers nets e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnder the water. And as meale and water kneaded together and baked, doe grow into a hardneſſe, ſo the drie and viſcous exhalation is by force of the heate in thunder hardened into a ſtone.</p>

               <note place="margin">Zonarus tom. 2 Annalium.</note>Another ſinne, which God doth puniſh with light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings is Magycke and Sorcerie.

            <p>An other ſin plagued with lightning is cruelty, and blood-ſhed, that ſo iudgement may be without mercy to them that ſhew no mercy. <hi>Hatto</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Mentz</hi> when in the yeare of Chriſt 918,<note place="margin">Iam. 2.</note> by the inſtigation of <hi>Conrad</hi> the Emperour: he endeuoured to murther <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> Duke of Saxony, was ſuddenly ſlain with a ſtroke of lightning. For this cauſe is the Lord in the Scripture, ſo often called the Lord of hoaſtes, that is the Lorde of Armies:<note place="margin">Malac. 1. Ierem. 5.</note> becauſe all thinges in heauen and earth, are a part of his Armie to plague the wicked, and to fight for the godly. In the heauens he hath fire, to powre down vpon Sodom and Gomorrah: hee hath in the aire, thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deringes, lightninges and blazing ſtarres to terrifie the heartes of the wicked: he hath the earth to ſwallow vp <hi>Core, Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram:</hi> the ſea to drown <hi>Pharao</hi> and his Armie: Dogges to licke vp <hi>Iezabels</hi> bloud, beares to deuoure them that mocked <hi>Elizeus:</hi> the canker-worm and Caterpillar to deſtroy the fruites of the vngodly, yea there is no Creature ſo vile and baſe, but it is a part of the hoaſt of God to puniſh and deſtroy, euen the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieſt in the world. <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Antiochus</hi> were two mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous tyrantes, yet was one of them deſtroied with lice, and the other with worms. Lightning hath but a poore and baſe beginning of exhalations, drawne vppe from the earth, yet by the power of God, being inflamed &amp; gathering force in the aire, it is enabled to confound whatſoeuer doth exalt it ſelfe againſt God his diuine Maieſtie.</p>
            <p>An other ſinne which God doth puniſh with fire from Heauen, is drunkenneſſe and whoredome, as <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiel</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:4105:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
cap. 16. doth ſhew of the deſtruction of <hi>Sodom,</hi> that it was for their fulneſſe of bread, that is exceſſe of meats and drinkes, according to the Hebrew Phraſe, and for their committing abhomination, that is, for their filthy and damnable luſtes. Concerning theſe thinges, I take not vpon me to iudge of the inhabitantes of the towne lately puniſhed: But I pray God, that euery one may now ſo iudge himſelfe, that hee be no hereafter further iudged of the Lord.</p>
            <p>The ſecond cauſe of the harms done by lightnings, is for inſtructions ſake, that others may learne to take heed and to feare God, and in this reſpect God dooth ſometimes puniſh his deareſt ſeruantes. In the yeare of our Sauiour, 1551. an honeſt Cittizen of <hi>Creutzburge,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Garcaeus lib. de meteorolog.</note> ſtanding by his table, and a dogge laying by his feete, were both of them ſuddenly ſlaine by a lightning: yet a young child which ſtood hard by his Father, was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued ſafe. <hi>Iob</hi> his flocke of ſeuen thouſand ſheepe &amp; his ſeruants,<note place="margin">Iob. 1.16.</note> were ſuddenly deſtroyed with fire from heauen, not ſo much for the ſinnes of <hi>Iob</hi> and his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, as to trie the faith of <hi>Iob,</hi> and to make him a ſchoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maiſter of Patience to all poſteritie. So it falleth out in all other kindes of puniſhments:<note place="margin">Luk. 13.1.</note> 
               <hi>Doe you thinke</hi> (ſaith our Sauiour Chriſt) that <hi>thoſe Galileans whoſe bloud Pilate mingled with their ſacrifices, were greater ſinners then all other Galileans? I tell yon nay, but except yee amend your liues yee ſhall likewiſe periſh: or thinke yee that thoſe eighteene vpon whome the Tower of Siloam fell; were ſinners aboue all them which dwell in Ieruſalem?

            </p>
            <p>There is none ſo deſperate, but will he, nill he, ſhall by thunderinges and lightnigns receiue admonition, if not to inſtruct him to amendment of life, yet at the leaſt
<pb facs="tcp:4105:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>

            <p>The third chiefe cauſe of fearefull lightnings is called fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidicall, or prognoſticall,<note place="margin">Garcaeus in Me<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teorol</note> when God doth by them fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warn vs of greater calamities to fall afterward vpon vs, vnleſſe wee amend our wicked and ſinfull life.</p>

            <p>So in the yeare 1062. in the month of <hi>February</hi> there fell terrible lightnings vpon the Citty of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> but preſently vpon it an infectious plague did wonderfully waſt that Citty.</p>
            <p>God of his infinite mercy graunt vs ſuch true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for our ſinnes and ſuch vnfained conuerſion from our vngodly behauiour, that theſe his iudgements thus threatned vpon vs may fauourably be turned aſide.

For the line to our ſight is a right line, but the line of ſounds bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the aire is circular, or giricall, giricall as I haue ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the aforeſaid example of the ſtone caſt into the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. So when we ſee a man hewing wood a farre off, the ſight of the ſtroke commeth to our ſight before ſound of the noice (which beateth the aire circularely) can come to our hearing. Others appoint meere Magicall, that is wick<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed and vngodly remedies, to wit to hang about the necke or body inchanted herbs, ſtones or iewels. Such deuiſes ſauoring of ſorceries can in no wiſe be agreeable to true Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>Some haue taught that bay trees &amp; the skins of ſeacalues are remedies againſt the dangers of lightnings. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Suetonius</hi> affirmeth, that <hi>Tiberius Ceſar</hi> would crown himſelfe with bay bows, &amp; couer his tents with the skins of ſea calues. <hi>Vt a fulmine tutus eſſet,</hi> that he might bee ſafe from lightnings.</p>
            <p>The onely true remedy is firſt by true faith,<note place="margin">Pſal. 92. v. 1, et 5.</note> to put our full truſt in God. For (as the prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith) <hi>If wee abide vnder ſhadow of the Almighty, we ſhall not be afraid of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny feares of the night, nor of the arrow that flyeth by day:</hi> and ſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>condly,

by hearty repentance to remoue the cauſes of Gods heauie iudgements,<note place="margin">Iſay. 59.1. Pſal. 112. v. 1.4. &amp; 6. &amp; 7.</note> and to forſake all ſuch ſinnes as doe make a diuiſion betwixt God and vs. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>phet <hi>Dauid</hi> pronounceth of him that <hi>delighteth in Gods commandements, and is mercifull and leudeth and will guide his words with diſcretion that he ſhall not be afraid of any euill tidings he ſhall ſurely neuer be remoued but the righteous ſhall bee had in euerlaſting remembrance.</hi>

               <head>An addition of the Author ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the opinions of Philoſophers and <hi>Aſtronomers touching Thundrings and Lightnings.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THe generall naturall cauſe which the Phlo-ſophers doe giue of Thunders and Lightenings is this. Firſt a viſcous vapour ioyned with a hot exhalation is lifted vp to the higheſt part of the middle region of the aire, by vertue of the Planets: then the waterie vapour by the coldneſſe both of place and of matter, is thickned into a clowd, and the exhalation (which was drawne vp with it) is ſhut within the clowd, and driuen into ſtraights.</p>
               <p>This hotte exhalation flying the touching of the cold clowd, doth flie into the depth of the clowd that doeth compaſſe it about, and courſeth vp and downe in the clowd, ſeeking ſome paſsage out, which when it cannot find, it maketh a way by force, and beeing kindled, by the violent motion it breaketh through the clowde. If the ſides of the hollowe clowd be thicke, and the exhalation drie and copious, then there is made both thunder and lightning: but if the clowd be thin, and the exhalation alſo rare and thin, then there is lightening without thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
               <p>The thunder then commeth, when the fierie ſpirits and exhalations beeing (as it were) ſhut vp in priſon, doe by <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> wraſtle with the congealed vapours which haue impriſoned the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The like we ſee in al moiſt bodies which haue a hot ſpirit ſo included, that it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not get out, the Cheſnut in roſting amongſt cinders giueth a cracke, a bladder filled with aire, being violently broken maketh a noiſe. When greene wood is burned, the ſpirits burſt out with ſome little crack: but gun-powder iſſuing out of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance maketh afarre greater ſound. The clowdes then which do farre exceed the greatneſſe of mountaines muſt
<pb facs="tcp:4105:12"/>
needes giue out a more forcible roaring. Eſpecially ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that in them there is added a more principall opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the handie worke of God, whereupon thunder in the Scriptures is called <hi>the thunder of God,</hi> Pſal. 77.17. <hi>The voice of thy thunder was heard round about.</hi> And Pſal. 104.7. <hi>at the voice of thy thunder they are afraid.</hi> So Pſal. 18.13. <hi>The Lord thundred out of heauen, and the moſt higheſt gaue out his voice, hailestones and coales of fire.</hi> So Iob. 38.25. <hi>Who doth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide the ſpowts for the raine, or the way for the lightenings of the thunder?</hi> as if he ſhould ſay: none can doe it but God alone.</p>
