            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>'TIS sufficient Commendation of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing <hi>History,</hi> That it was Written by Mr. <hi>George Buchanan</hi>; Who was no less the Glory of the Age wherein he Lived, than of his Country. Being a Person both of that Elevation and Justness of Thought, and of that Neatness and Elegancy of Expression, that among all the Ancient, as well as the Modern Writers, few do equal, and none do exceed him. And as he knew in Reference to Persons and Things, <hi>What to say,</hi> and <hi>What not to say,</hi> so he was of that Courage and Integrity, to conceal nothing that ought to be delivered, but hath used the same Freedom in Transmitting down the Lives of Princes to Posterity, that they allowed themselves in leading them. And if ever any Book deserved the Character of answering the Title, this doth, being truly a <hi>History,</hi> and not a <hi>Romance,</hi> wherein the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor representeth Things as they were; Commending without <hi>Flattery,</hi> and Censuring without <hi>Satyr.</hi>

            <head>GEORGE BUCHANAN's EPISTLE DEDICATORY TO JAMES the Sixth, King of the SCOTS.</head>
            <p>AT my Return, after Four and Twenty Years ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence from my Country, I desired nothing more than to review my Papers, that were dispersed, and many ways injured by the Iniquity of the Times: For I found, that the over-Officiousness of my Friends, to precipitate the Publication of what was yet unfit to see the Light, and that excessive Liberty which Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribers take to Censure the Works of other Men, had altered many Things, and corrupted others, according to their several Humours. But whilst I was endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to remedy these Disorders, the sudden and unexpected Solicitations of my Friends broke my Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures; all of them, as if they had Conspired together, Exhorting me to lay aside Things of less Weight, that rather delight the Ear than instruct the Mind, and apply my self to Write the History of our Nation, as a Subject not only suitable to my Age, and sufficient to Answer the Expectation of my Country Men; but deserving great Commendation, and most fit to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve ones Memory to succeeding Ages. Amongst other Reasons, which I omit, they added, That though <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> be the most Famous Island in the World, and every part of its History contain most Remarkable Things; yet, scarce one was to be found in any Age, who durst attempt so great a Work, or had acquitted
<pb facs="tcp:56771:4"/>
himself, as the Subject deserved. Neither was it the least Inducement to this Vndertaking, that I hoped my pains herein would not be unfitting for, nor unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to, you. For it seemed to me Absurd and Shamefull, That You, who in this Your tender Age, have Read the Histories of all Nations, and retain very many of them in Your Memory, should only be a Stranger at Home. Besides, an incurable Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per having made me unfit to discharge, in Person, the Care of Your Instruction, committed to me, I thought that sort of Writing, which tends to the Information of the Mind, would best supply the want of my At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance, and resolved to send You Faithfull Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors from History, that you might make use of their Advice in Your Deliberations, and imitate their Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in Your Actions. For there are amongst Your Ancestors, Men Excellent in every Respect, of whom Posterity will never be ashamed; and, to omit others, You will hardly find in History, any one Worthy to be compared with our <hi>David.</hi> And if the Divine Goodness was so Liberal to him, in those most wretched and wicked Times, we may with Reason hope, That You may be (as the Royal Prophet says) <hi>A Pattern of all those Excellencies, which Mothers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire in their Children, when they give them their best Wishes;</hi> and that this Government, which seems to be hurried on to Ruin and Destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, may be supported, 'till the time shall come, when all Sublunary Things having finished the Course ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed them by Gods Eternal Decree, shall arrive at their designed Period.</p>

            <head>The LIFE of George Buchanan, Written by Himself, Two Years before His Death.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>GEORGE BUCHANAN</hi> was Born in <hi>Lennox-Shire,</hi> (commonly called the <hi>Sheriff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> of <hi>Dumbarton</hi>) in <hi>Scotland,</hi> Scituate near the River, or Water of <hi>Blane,</hi> in the Year of Our Lord One Thousand Five Hundred and Six, about the First Day of <hi>February</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> in a Country Town within that Shire; of a Family rather Ancient than Rich. His Father died of the <hi>Stone,</hi> in the Flower of his Age; whilst his Grandfather was yet alive, who being a Spend-Thrift, their Family which was but low before, was now reduced to almost the extremity of Want. Yet such was the frugal care of his Mother, <hi>Agnes Heriot,</hi> that she brought up Five Sons and Three Daughters, to Mens and Womens Estate. Of the Five Sons, <hi>George</hi> was One. His Uncle, <hi>Iames Heriot,</hi> perceiving his promising Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity in their own Country Schools, took him from thence, and sent him to <hi>Paris.</hi> There he applied himself to his Studies, and especially to Poetry, either having a Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Genius</hi> that way; or else, out of Necessity, (because 'twas the only Method of Study, propounded to him, in his Youth.) Before he had been there Two Years, his Uncle Died, and he himself fell dangerously Sick, and being in want beside, he was forced to return into his own Country. After his return to <hi>Scotland,</hi> he spent almost an year in taking care of his Health; then he went into the <hi>French</hi> Army of Auxilliaries, newly arrived in <hi>Scotland,</hi> on purpose to obtain some Skill in the <hi>Art Military.</hi> But that Expedition proving Fruitless, the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my retreated in a very sharp and snowy Winter, so that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56771:5"/>
he again relapsed into a Disease, which confined him all that Winter to his Bed. Early in the Spring he was sent to St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> to hear the Lectures of <hi>Iohn Major,</hi> who, though very old, Read <hi>Logick,</hi> or rather <hi>Sophistry,</hi> in that University. The Summer after, he accompanied him into <hi>France,</hi> and there he fell into the Troubles of the <hi>Lutheran Sect,</hi> which then began to encrease: He struggled with the Difficulties of Providence, almost Two Years, and at last was admitted into the <hi>Barbaran</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, where he was <hi>Grammar</hi> Professor, almost Three Years. During that time, <hi>Gilbert Kennedy,</hi> Earl of <hi>Cassils,</hi> one of the young <hi>Scotish</hi> Nobles, being in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, was much taken with his Ingenuity and Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, so that he entertained him for Five Years, and brought him back with him into <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Afterwards having a Mind to return to <hi>Paris</hi> to his old Studies, he was detained by the King, and made Tutor to <hi>Iames</hi> his Natural Son. In the mean time, an Elegy made by him, at leasure times, came into the Hands of the <hi>Franciscans,</hi> wherein he Writes, That he was solicited in a Dream by St. <hi>Francis,</hi> to joyn himself to his <hi>Order.</hi> In that Poem, there were one or two Passages that reflected on them very sorely, which those Ghostly Fathers, notwithstanding their Profession of Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Humility, took more heinously, than Men (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving obtained such a Vogue for Piety among the vulgar) ought to have done, upon so small an occasion of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. But finding no just Ground for their immoderate Wrath and Fury, they had recourse to the common Crime of those Days, which they objected to those they wish'd ill to, <hi>viz. The Cause of Religion.</hi> Thus, whilst they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged their Malice and Disgust, they made him, who was not well affected to them before, a greater Enemy to their Liceniousness, and rendred him more inclineable to the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Cause. In the mean time, the King, with <hi>Magdalen</hi> his Wife, came from <hi>France,</hi> not without the resentment of the <hi>Priesthood,</hi> who were afraid, that the Royal Lady, having been bred up under her Aunt, the Queen of <hi>Navar,</hi> should attempt some Innovation in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion:
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56771:5"/>
But this fear soon vanished upon her Death, which followed shortly after.</p>
            <p>A while after, there arose some suspitions at Court a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst some of the Nobility, who were thought to have conspired against the King, and, in that matter, the King was persuaded, the <hi>Franciscans</hi> were somewhat concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; so that he Commanded <hi>Buchanan,</hi> who at that time was at Court, (thÃ´ he were ignorant of the Disgusts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Him and that Order) to write a <hi>Satyr</hi> against them. He was loth to offend either of them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, thÃ´ he made a Poem, yet it was but short, and such as might admit of a doubtful Interpretation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he satisfied neither Party; not the King, who would have had a tart and biting Invective; nor the <hi>Fathers,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who lookt on it as a capital Offence, to have any thing said of them, but what was <hi>Honourable.</hi> So that receiving a Second Command to write more pungently against them, he began that <hi>Miscellany,</hi> which now bears the Title of the <hi>Franciscan,</hi> and gave it to the King. But shortly after, being made acquainted by his Friends at Court, that Cardinal <hi>Beton</hi> sought his Life, and had offered the King a Sum of Money, as a price for his Head, he escaped out of prison and fled for <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> But there also things were at such an uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that the very same Day, and almost with one and the same Fire, the Men of Both Factions, (<hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants</hi> and <hi>Papists</hi>) were burnt together, <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, in his old Age, being more intent on his own Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, than the Purity or Reformation of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. This uncertainty of Affairs in <hi>England,</hi> se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded by his ancient Acquaintance with the <hi>French,</hi> and the innate courtesie of that Nation, drew him again into <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As soon as he came to <hi>Paris,</hi> he found Cardinal <hi>Beton</hi> his utter Enemy, Embassador there, so that to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw himself from his Fury, at the Invitation of <hi>Andrew Goveanus</hi> he went to <hi>Bourdeaux.</hi> There he presided, and Taught Three Years in the Schools, which were erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the Publick Cost; At that time he wrote Four Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedies, which were afterwards occasionally Published;

But that which he wrote first, called the <hi>Baptist,</hi> was Printed last; and then the <hi>Medea</hi> of <hi>Euripides.</hi> He wrote them in compliance with the Custom of the School, which was to have a Play wrote once a Year, that so by acting of them, he might, as much as he could calll back the <hi>French</hi> Youth from Allegories, with which they then were overmuch delighted, to the Imitation of the Ancients. This Affair succeeding, even almost beyond his Hope, he took more pains in compiling the other Two Tragedies, called <hi>Iephthe</hi> and <hi>Alcestis,</hi> because, he thought, they would fall under a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer scrutiny of the <hi>Learned.</hi> And yet, during this time, he was not wholly free from Trouble, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing harassed between the Menaces of the <hi>Cardinal</hi> on the One side, and of the <hi>Franciscans</hi> on the Other. For the Cardinal had wrote Letters to the Archbishop of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> to apprehend him; but, providentially, those Letters were delivered to some of <hi>Buchanan</hi>'s Friends. However, the death of the King of <hi>Scots,</hi> and the Pestilence, which then reigned over all <hi>Aquitain,</hi> dispelled that Fear.</p>
            <p>In the interim, an Express came to <hi>Goveanus</hi> from the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> requiring him to come into that Kingdom, and to bring with him some Men, Learned, both in the Greek and Latin Tongues, that they might Read the <hi>Liberal Arts,</hi> and especially, the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the <hi>Aristotelian</hi> Philosophy in those Schools, which were then a Building, with a great deal of Cost and Expence. <hi>Buchanan,</hi> being addressed to, easily as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to go for one. For, whereas he saw that all <hi>Europe,</hi> besides, was either actually in Foreign or Domestique Wars, or else suddenly likely so to be, that one Corner of the World, was, in his Opinion, likeliest to be free from Tumults and Combustions: And besides, his Companions in that Journy were such, that they seemed rather his Acquaintance and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Friends, than Strangers or Aliens to him. For many of them had been his Intimates for several Years, and are well known to the World by their Learned Works, as <hi>Nicolaus Gruchius, Gulielmus Garentaens, Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobus
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56771:6"/>
Tevius,</hi> and <hi>Elias Vinetus.</hi> Upon which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, he did not only joyn himself to their Society, but also persuaded a Brother of his, called <hi>Patrick</hi> to be one of so Illustrious a Society. And the Truth is, the matter succeeded excellently well at the beginning, but the death of <hi>Andrew Goveanus,</hi> (which hapned, as it were, in the midst of our Race, and was mature enough for himself, but very prejudicial to us) put a stop to its happy Progress. For, after his Decease, all our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, endeavoured at first to insnare us by Treachery, and soon after, ran violently upon us, as it were with open Mouth; and their Agents and Instruments being great Enemies to the Accused, they laid hold of Three of them, and haled them to Prison; whence, after a long and nasty durance, they were brought forth to their Answers; and, after many bitter Taunts, were remanded to Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son again: and yet no Accuser did appear in Court a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them. As for <hi>Buchanan,</hi> they insulted most bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly over him, as being a Stranger, and knowing also, that he had very few Friends in that Country, who would either rejoyce in his Prosperity, sympathize with his Grief, or Revenge the Wrongs offered to him. The Crimes laid to his Charge, was the Poem he wrote against the <hi>Franciscans,</hi> which he himself before he went from <hi>France</hi> had deposited in the hands of the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> neither did his Accusers perfectly know what it was: For he had given but one Copy of it to the King of <hi>Scots,</hi> by whose Command he wrote it. They further objected, <hi>His eating of Flesh in Lent,</hi> thÃ´ there be not a Man in all <hi>Spain,</hi> but uses the same Liberty: Besides, he had given shrewd Girds against <hi>Monks,</hi> which yet none but <hi>Monks</hi> could well except against.</p>
            <p>Moreover, they took it much amiss, that, in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Familiar Discourse with some young <hi>Portugal</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemn, upon mention made of the Eucharist, he should affirm; That, in his Judgment <hi>Austin</hi> was more incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to the Party Condemned by the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, in that Controversie. There were also other Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses produc'd against him, (as, some years after, it came to his Knowledge) viz. <hi>Iohn Tolpin,</hi> a <hi>Norman,</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:56771:7"/>
and <hi>Iohn Ferrerius</hi> of <hi>Sub-Alpine Liguria</hi>; their Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony was, That they had heard from divers Creditable Persons, <hi>That</hi> Buchanan <hi>was not Orthodox, as to the Roman Faith and Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to return to the matter, after the Inquisitors had wearied both themselves and him, for almost an year and a half; at last, that they might not seem to have causelesly vex'd a Man, of some Name and Note in the World, they shut him up in a Monastery for some Months; there to be more exactly Disciplined and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed by the Monks, who (to give them their due) were Men, otherwise, not uncivil, or bad, though Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of all Religion.</p>
            <p>'Twas principally at this time, that he rendred most of <hi>David</hi>'s Psalms, into several sorts of Latin Metre. At last, he was set at Liberty, and suing for a Pass, and Accommodations from the King, to return into <hi>France,</hi> he was desired by him, to stay where he was, and he had a small parcel of Money bestowed upon him for his daily Expence, till some better Provision might be made for his Subsistence. But he, being tired out with delay, as being put off, to no certain time, nor on any sure Grounds of hope, having got the opportunity of Passage, in a Ship then Riding in the Bay of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> was wafted over into <hi>England.</hi> He made no long abode in <hi>England,</hi> though fair of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers were made him there; for he saw that all things were in an Hurry and Combustion, under a very young King, the Nobles at Variance one with another, and the Minds of the Commons yet in a Ferment, upon the account of their Civil Combustions. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he returned into <hi>France,</hi> about the time that the Siege of <hi>Metz</hi> was raised. There he was, in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, compell'd by his Friends, to Write a Poem con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that Siege; which he did, though somewhat un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly; because he was loth to interfere with several of his Acquaintance, and especially with <hi>Mellinus San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelasius,</hi> who had composed a Learned and Elegant Poem, on that Subject. From thence he was call'd over into <hi>Italy,</hi> by <hi>Charles de CossÃ©</hi> of <hi>Brescia,</hi> who then
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56771:7"/>
managed matters with prosperous Success, in the <hi>Gallic</hi> and <hi>Ligustic</hi> Countries about the <hi>Po:</hi> He abode with him and his Son <hi>Timoleon,</hi> sometimes in <hi>Italy,</hi> and sometimes in <hi>France,</hi> the space of Five Years, till the year of <hi>Christ</hi> One Thousand Five Hunderd and Sixty, the most part of which time he spent in the Study of the Holy Scriptures, that so he might be able to make a more exact Judgment of the Controversies in Religion, which in those days did Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise the greatest part of Men. 'Tis true, those disputes were somewhat silenced in <hi>Scotland,</hi> when that Kingdom was freed from the Tyranny of the <hi>Guises</hi> of <hi>France</hi>; so he returned thither, and entered himself into the Church of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some of his Writings, in former times, being, as it were, Redeemed from a Shipwrack, were Collected and Published by him: The rest of them, which are yet in the Hands of his Friends, he commits to the disposal of Providence. At present, being in the Seventy Fourth Year of his Age, he is in Attendance on the Education of <hi>Iames</hi> the Sixth King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to whom he was appointed Tutor, in the Year One Thousand Five Hundred Sixty Five, where, being bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with the Infirmities of old Age, he longs for the desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Haven of his Rest.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He departed this Life at</hi> Edinburgh, <hi>on the</hi> 28<hi>th day of</hi> September, <hi>in the Year of our Salvation One Thousand Five Hundred Eighty Two.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen I first determined to Write the Famous At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements of our Ancestors, and, after I had purged them from the mixture of vain Fables, to vindicate them from oblivion; I thought it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducive to my purpose, to repeat from the very beginning,<note place="margin">The Authors design.</note> (as much as so long a distance of Time; and <hi>first</hi> the scarcity, <hi>then</hi> the loss, of Learned Monuments, would permit,) What the situation of the Countrys were; What was the nature of the Soil and Air; What were the ancient Names and Manners,<note place="margin">

               </note> and Who were the first Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, of the Islands, called of old, <hi>Britanny</hi>; which are extended between <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> in a long Tract of Land toward <hi>France. Albion</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> Two of them, do far exceed the rest in Bigness, and therefore of these Two I shall speak <hi>first</hi>; afterwards, as conveniency serves, I will explain the <hi>site</hi> and the Names of the rest.</p>
            <p>The first, for bigness, is <hi>Albion,</hi> That now alone retains the Name of <hi>Britain,</hi> which was heretofore common to them all.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Albion.</hi>
               </note> Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its breadth and length, other Writers do, in effect, agree with <hi>Caesar,</hi> namely,<note place="margin">Its length and breadth.</note> that the length of it from North to South is 800 miles; and the breadth, where it is widest, which is (as some think) where it looks towards <hi>France</hi>; or, (as others say) from the point of St. <hi>Davids</hi> in <hi>South-Wales,</hi> to <hi>Yarmouth</hi> in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> almost
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56771:9"/>
200 miles; From thence it narrows by degrees, till we come to the borders of <hi>Scotland.</hi> The <hi>Romans,</hi> who, as yet, knew not the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thest parts thereof, believed the <hi>Island</hi> to be <hi>Triangular,</hi> but when they proceeded a little further,<note place="margin">It was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angular by the <hi>Romans.</hi>
               </note> they found, that beyond <hi>Adrian</hi>'s Wall, it extended it self broader by degrees, and ran out far towards the North-East. This in brief, concerning its <hi>bigness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Climate of <hi>Britain</hi> is more temperate than That of <hi>France,</hi> as <hi>Caesar</hi> affirms, but the Climate of <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> milder than them both. The Air thereof is seldom clear, but commonly darkened with thick Mists,<note place="margin">The Air.</note> the Winters are mild enough, rather Rainy than Snowy. The Soil brings forth Corn plentifully,<note place="margin">The Soil.</note> and, besides Corn, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth all sorts of Metals. It is also very fruitful in Breeds of Cattle. They, who inhabit the extream parts of the Islands, which are more infested with cold,<note place="margin">The Food of some of its Inhabitants, in old time.</note> do eat Bread made of Oatmeal; and, for Drink, they use a Wine or Strong Liquor made of Corn steeped into Malt: Some do boil Whey, and keep it in Hogsheads under Ground for some months, which is counted, by many of them, not only an wholesom, but a very pleasant, Drink. There was no Controversy concerning the Name of <hi>Britain</hi> amongst the Ancients, except that the <hi>Greeks</hi> call'd it <hi>Brettania,</hi> the <hi>Latines, Britannia.</hi> Other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have their Appellation of it, some one, some 'tother, at their pleasure. But of late some Men have started up, not so much desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of Truth as of Contention, who hoped to make themselves Famous by Carping at other Eminent Persons; for they imagined, that they must needs obtain a great opinion of Learning amongst the Vulgar, who dared to enter the Lists against, and to Combate with, all Antiquity; And though the Dispute were of a thing of no great consequence, yet, because it concerned the very name of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, they thought it worth contending for, with all their might, as if all the Ancient Glory of the whole Nation had lain at stake. They say,<note place="margin">Its ancient Names, Three, (according to some) <hi>Pruda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, Pryta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neia,</hi> and <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tannia.</hi>
               </note> that three ancient Names of the Island have their several Assertors, <hi>viz. Prudania, Prytaneia,</hi> and <hi>Britannia. Lud</hi> contends with might and main for <hi>Prudania; Thomas Eliot,</hi> a <hi>British</hi> Knight, for <hi>Prytaneia,</hi> but very modestly; almost all other Nations do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Name of <hi>Britain.</hi>

A Village, or a Town? A Man, or a Woman? Here I am posed too, (says he;) but, I conjecture, that <hi>Britain</hi> is signified by that Name. Go too, then, let <hi>Prudania</hi> signifie <hi>Britain.</hi> Yet what doth this thy Fragment make for thee? I would ask this Question of thee<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Whether it affirms <hi>Prudania</hi> to be the true Name of the Island, or else doth not rather upbraid their Ignorance, who ascribe that false Name to it?

that <hi>Caesar,</hi> who was so inquisitive to know the Affairs of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> as, What Men did Inhabit that Country, then, and before his time; What Animals and Plants did grow, or were bred, therein; What were the Laws and Customs of the Country, do you, I say, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive, that he, who had been so solicitous about those things, would have neglected to set down the Name of the whole <hi>Island?</hi> Or, that he, who, with so great Faithfulness and Diligence, gave right Names to the Cities of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> would deprive the <hi>Britains</hi> of their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Glory? Upon the whole, I see no reason at all, why <hi>Lud</hi> should think, that the old Name of the Island was <hi>Prudania,</hi> (for he values himself much on the account of this Title,) unless Words do also contract Antiquity from the rust of a Worm-eaten Paper. This is all I have to say against <hi>Lud,</hi> at present, who by home-bred Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, and by his own Dreams together, hath thought fit to oppose himself against the current verdict of all the Learned Men, that now are, or ever have been, in the World.</p>

               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Prytaneia.</hi>
               </note> He judged it not improbable, that an Island abounding with plenty of all things, not only for the Necessities, but even the very Ornaments, of Life, should be so called. In this case, if we should weigh the reason of Names, <hi>Sicily</hi> might be rather called <hi>Prytaneia,</hi> and some other Islands also, which are, as more Fruitful, so far less in compass, than <hi>Britain.</hi> Besides, in those <hi>Authors,</hi> by whose Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony the Name <hi>Prytaneia</hi> is confirmed, it easily appears, that the Orthography is vitiated.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Stephanus.</hi>
               </note> As for <hi>Stephanus,</hi> there is the highest incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy in him. In the Word <hi>Albion,</hi> he says, that That is the Island of <hi>Brettain,</hi> following <hi>Martian</hi> therein, as he alleges. In the Words <hi>Invernia</hi> and <hi>Inverna,</hi> it is writ <hi>Praetanica.</hi> Elsewhere, says he, in the Ocean are the <hi>Brettish</hi> Islands, whose Inhabitants are called, <hi>Brettains.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Martian</hi> and <hi>Ptolomy.</hi>
               </note> But <hi>Martian</hi> and <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> in these Words, make <hi>P</hi> the first Letter; if any one compare the places, without doubt, he will find, that the Writing is corrupted, and that <hi>Stephanus</hi> himself was of opinion, that <hi>Brettania</hi> ought to be writ by <hi>B</hi> the first Letter, and two <hi>tt</hi>'s. <hi>Eliot,</hi> I believe, was not ignorant of this, and therefore, being content to advise his Reader, as much as he thought fit, what things Men, greedy of Praise, will scrape together for the Ostentation of their Learning, he leaves the matter in dispute intirely to his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

Let him shew, if he can, what Author ever wrote <hi>Prudania,</hi> before <hi>Aristotle:</hi> Let him turn and wind himself, as he please, he will never be able to do it; seeing, some Ages after <hi>Aristotle,</hi> 'tis certain, That the <hi>Bards</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted nothing to Writing.

            <p>Amidst this disagreement of Opinions, and the diverse manners and customs of Speech; <hi>Lud</hi> thinks it most adviseable, always to look to <hi>Antiquity,</hi> and the Country-manner of Speech, as a Pole-Star, and, by That, to direct the whole course of his Language: For my part, I would not much dissent from him, if that, which was in ancient use, and therefore thought certain, might be always ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served and kept. <note n="(a)" place="margin">Ancient words cannot always be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, and Why?</note> But there are several Reasons why that cannot be done.</p>
            <p>First, Because, in every Language, 'tis very difficult to find out the <note n="(b)" place="margin">'tis hard to find the Origin of old Words.</note> Original Words; and therefore 'tis more adviseable, in this case, to follow the Custom of the Learned, than by a vain and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous Labour, always to search after Originals, as after the <note n="(c)" place="margin">Which was unknown to the Ancients, but later In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries have found it out.</note> Fountain of <hi>Nilus,</hi> especially, since the Original of Words depends not on the Judgment of the Wiser sort, but on the pleasure of the Vulgar, who, for the most part, are rude and incult, and therefore anxiously to inquire after their Judgments, is a piece of needless Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56771:11"/>
and, if you should find out what they mean, it would not be worth your Labour. For, as in the Generation of all other Things, which either grow naturally of themselves, or else are invented by Men for the use of Life; the First Embryo's are very imperfect, and come forth less acceptable, not only for Use, but even for Sight; yet afterward, by Culture, they wax gentle, and are made amiable by due Treatment: '<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>is so in Language, which, taking its first Rise from Men rude and impolite, came forth harsh, rugged, and uncouth; then, by use, it gradually puts off its natural Horror and Unpleasantness, becoming more gentle and sweeter to the Ear, and more easily insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuating into the mind of Man. And therefore, in this case, (if in any case at all) I think something is to be indulged to the Custom of Men more polite than others; and that such a pleasure, which is neither uncomely nor ungraceful, as far as it is not hurtful to Mens Manners, is not to be despised. But if any one be born under such an ill Constellation, that he rather affects the Language of <hi>Cato</hi> and <hi>Ennius,</hi> than of <hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Terence</hi>; and when Corn is found out, yet had rather feed on Mast still, my Vote is, <hi>Much good may it do him.</hi> But this our present dispute is not concerning the Purity and Elegan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Latin Tongue, for it nothing affects It, to know, how the <hi>Britains</hi> did heretofore sound forth their Letters or Words: My whole endeavour is, to shew, how the <hi>Latins</hi> pronounced the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish,</hi> not how the <hi>British</hi> pronounced the <hi>Latin,</hi> Tongue. For my part, I had rather be ignorant of the doting Fables of the old <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,</hi> than to forget that little of the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue, which I imbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, when I was a Youth. And there is no other cause, why I take it less in disdain, that the old <note n="(d)" place="margin">

               </note> 
               <hi>Scotish</hi> Language doth by degrees de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay, than that, thereby, I joyfully perceive those barbarous Sounds, by little and little, to vanish away, and, in their place, the sweetness of <hi>Latin</hi> Words to succeed: And in this Transmigration of Languages, if one must needs yield to another, Good-now, of the Two, let us pass from Rusticity and Barbarism, to Culture and Humanity; and, by our Choice and Judgment, let us put off that uncouthness which accrued to us by the Infelicity of our Birth. And if our Pains and Industry can avail any thing in this case, let us bestow them all this way, <hi>viz.</hi> To polish, as much as we can, the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Tongues, which the better part of the World hath publickly received; and, if there be any Soloecisms or Flaws sticking thereto, from the Contagion of Barbarous Languages, let us do what we can to purge them away.</p>
            <p>Besides, this over-anxious diligence about Foreign Names, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in transferring them into another Language, can never be kept, neither is it expedient that it should: For what Language hath not these Letters and Sounds, which cannot fully be expressed by the Characters of another Tongue? What Nation, besides the <hi>German,</hi> can pronounce the Letter <note n="(e)" place="margin">The Letter <hi>W.</hi> hard to be pronounced, but by those that <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize.</hi>
               </note> W? Who can give that sound to the Letters <hi>D. G. P. T. X.</hi> and <hi>Z.</hi> in <hi>Latin,</hi> which the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> the <hi>Britains,</hi> and part of the <hi>Scots,</hi> do?</p>
            <p>Because of this absurdity of Sound, as I suppose, it is, that <note n="*" place="margin">

               </note> 
               <hi>Pliny,</hi> reckoning up the Cities of <hi>Spain,</hi> denies, that some of them can be well pronounced in the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue: Some he calls Ignoble, and of Barbarous Appellation; Others, he says, cannot be so much as
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56771:11"/>
named without grating the Ear. What, I beseech you, would <hi>Lud</hi> do in this case, if he were to write the History of <hi>Britain</hi> in <hi>Latin?</hi> With all his rust of Barbarism, I believe, he would scarce know how to pronouce the Genuine Names of the <hi>Brittons.</hi> For seeing he vexes himself so much how he should write <hi>Lud,</hi> either <hi>Lhuyd,</hi> or <hi>Llud,</hi> or else bare <hi>Ludd,</hi> neither of which can be writ, pronounced, or heard amongst <hi>Latinists</hi> without regret. If he retains the true Sound, he will make not a <hi>Latin,</hi> but a Semi-Barbarous Oration. But if he bend Foreign Words to the sound of the <hi>Latin,</hi> he will commit as great a Trespass, as <hi>Caesar</hi> is said to have done in the Word <hi>Britannus.</hi> What then shall we do, to please so captious and so morose a Person, as <hi>Llud?</hi> Shall we call the Island <hi>Prudania,</hi> rather than <hi>Britannia? Lud</hi> himself, who is so severe a Censor of others, will not exact this of us: He will permit it to be called <hi>Prudania,</hi> from <hi>Pruda.</hi> But if any one dare to pronounce and call it <hi>Britannia,</hi> or <hi>Brettannia,</hi> he'll lay about him, and accuse him presently of violating Sacred Antiquity, of corrupting and contaminating the Ancient and Sincere Language; and, from a Robust and Masculine sound, of turning it into an Effeminate and soft Pronunciation. What shall we do in this case? Is it lawful for us to change or cleanse any Word from the uncouthness of its ancient Deformity? Or, if we may not change, yet, pray, may we not polish some rough Words, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline them a little from their incult Barbarity, that they may become more acceptable to Mens Ears?

And <hi>Festus Pompeius</hi> affirms, that what the <hi>Latins</hi> call <hi>Alba,</hi> the <hi>Sabins</hi> call <hi>Alpa,</hi> from whence the <hi>Alps</hi> had their Name, because they are white with continual Snow. For my part, as I assent concerning the one, that <hi>Album</hi> and <hi>Alpum</hi> were Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonymous amongst the Ancients, and I have the Authority not of <hi>Festus</hi> only, but of <hi>Strabo</hi> also, to support my Opinion; so I also judge, the <hi>Alps</hi> were so called, rather from their Height, than their Whiteness. My Reasons are, First, Because <hi>Alba</hi> is the Name of many Cities in <hi>Italy, France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> which are all situate on Hills, or near them: And besides, because <hi>Strabo</hi> acknowledges, that those Names, <hi>Alba, Alpa, Alpia, Albionia, Albici,</hi> without any difference, are derived from the same Root, in the Signification of Height; and therefore he shews, That they are most used, where the <hi>Alps</hi> begin to grow high.

               <hi>Bergomates</hi> to have had their Original, they discover themselves by their Names to be situated more highly, than happily; Therefore <hi>Albion</hi> and <hi>Bergion,</hi> Men, it seems, far taller than their Neighbors, in confidence of their Strength, did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Robberies in those Coasts of <hi>Liguria,</hi> whom <hi>Hercules,</hi> travelling that way, subdued by force of Arms.

But I, though I do not much differ from their Opinion, who assert, That <hi>Albion</hi> was so called from <hi>Album,</hi> so I think, the occasion of the Name was not from the Colour, but from the Height, of the Mountains: They, who imposed that <note n="(l)" place="margin">

Besides, this also adds Strength to my Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, That the Name of the Island, derived from <hi>Album,</hi> whether <hi>Albion,</hi> or <hi>Albium,</hi> as yet pertinaciously remains in <note n="(m)" place="margin">The Name <hi>Albion</hi> is still retained in part of <hi>Scotland.</hi>

But about two Miles lower, on the same River, there is a round Edifice made without any Lime, but so formed with sharp Stones, that part of the upper Stone is, as it were, Mortassed into the lower, so that the whole Work, mutually conjoyned, sustains it self with the weight of the Stones, from top to bottom, growing nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower and narrower by Degrees. The top of it is open: The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People have several Fancies, according to their divers Humours,<note place="margin">A strange Edifice.</note> concerning the Use and Author of this Structure. For my part, I once conjectured, That it was a Temple of the God <hi>Terminus,</hi> which, they say, was wont to be built round and open at top; And the <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni pacis</hi> near adjoyning seemed somwhat to strengthen my Conjecture, as if a Peace had been made there, of which these Hills are a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument, because there the Romans terminated the Bounds of their Jurisdiction and Empire; neither could any thing have altered my Opinion, unless I had been informed by creditable persons, That, in a certain Island, there are many Edifices in other respects like the Structure which I have spoken of, but that they are greater, and not so compact. There are also two Chapels in <hi>Ross</hi> of the like shape. These things made me suspend my Opinion, and to judge that these were <hi>Monuments</hi> or <hi>Trophies</hi> of some famous Deeds, placed, as it were, at the fag-end of the World, that they might be preserved from the Injury and Fury of Enemies. But whether these were <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies,</hi> or (as some think) <hi>Sepulchres</hi> of famous Men, I believe they were Monuments consecrated to be perpetuated to Posterity, but built by rude and unskilful Workmen, after the similitude of the <hi>Temple</hi> erected at <hi>Carron.</hi> On the right side of <hi>Carron,</hi> the Ground is generally plain and level, only<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> there is a little Hill in it, almost in the mid-space between the <hi>Duni pacis</hi> and the <hi>Temple</hi> or Chapel; and therein, at the bending of the Angle, the Footsteps of an ancient City do yet appear. But the Foundation of the Walls, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of the Streets, partly by reason of Countrymens Plowing up the Ground, and partly, by plucking out the square Stones to build some Rich Mens Houses thereabouts, are quite blended and confused.

            <p>There is a small Island, about Sixty Miles from <hi>Lewis,</hi> to the North-East, of a low and plain Soil, and well inhabited, its Name is <note n="*" place="margin">

               <hi>Rona,</hi> the Inhabitants thereof are rude Persons, void almost of all Religion. The Laird of it assigns a certain number of Families to Inhabit and Till it, and he allows them a sufficiency of great and small Cattle, whereby they may live well, and pay their Tribute, too; that which is above their own provision, they send every year to <hi>Lewis,</hi> to their Land-lord, who lives there; they commonly pay him, in the Name of a Tribute or Rent, a great quantity of Barly-Meal, sewed up in the Skins of Sheep, (for that kind of Grain grows plentifully amongst them,) Muttons and Sea-Fowl dried in the Sun, as much as remains, as a Surplusage of their yearly Provision; and if the multitude of <hi>Heads</hi> doth abound, they send also the Supernumerary Persons to their Land-lords. So that these, in my Judgment, are the only Persons in the whole World, who want nothing, but have all things to Satiety. And besides, being ignorant of Luxury and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness, they enjoy that Innocency and Tranquillity of Mind, which others take great pains to obtain, from the Precepts and Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of Wise Men. And this they have from their Ignorance of Vices, neither doth any thing seem to be wanting to their great Happiness, but that they do not understand the excellency of their Condition.

            <p>But their error may easily be refuted, partly out of <hi>Bede</hi> the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glo-Saxon,</hi> who, affirming, that the <hi>Britains</hi> sang the <note n="(a)" place="margin">The <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi> praised God in Five Tongues.</note> Praises of <hi>God</hi> in five several Languages, reckons the <hi>Pictish</hi> to be one; but if the <hi>Picts</hi> had then spoke the <hi>Saxon</hi> Language, he would not have distinguished it from the <hi>Saxon</hi>; (which then the <hi>English</hi> used, without corruption;) And partly also, out of those very Verses of <hi>Claudian,</hi> where he expresly declares; That the <hi>Picts</hi> were a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent People from the <hi>Saxons</hi>; For, he says, that the <hi>Orcades</hi> were the Country of the <hi>Saxons</hi>; and <hi>Thule,</hi> of the <hi>Picts</hi>; but whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their Original were, in this our Age, they use a Language dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent both from <hi>Scotch</hi> and <hi>English,</hi> but very near the <hi>Gothish.</hi> In their daily conversation, the common People do as yet retain much of their Ancient Parsimony, and therefore they are very sound in mind, and healthy in Body. <note n="(b)" place="margin">The Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the <hi>Orcades,</hi> Parsimonious and long liv'd.</note> Few of them dye of Diseases, but almost all of them, of old Age; and their Ignorance of Delights and Pleasures contributes more to the maintaining of their health, than the Skill and Diligence of <hi>Physitians</hi> doth, to others.

there, no, nor any one Deformed to look upon. They have little Horses, in shew contemptible, but strong enough, for all uses, even beyond belief.

            </p>
            <p>But the very Oldest of them were altogether ignorant of Letters, neither did they leave any Records of Ancient Matters behind them.</p>
            <p>The other were <hi>Bardlings</hi> or <hi>Sanachies,</hi> (as they call them,) which were maintain'd by the chief of the Ancient Clans, and by some Wealthy Men besides, one a peice, on purpose to Chant out (by Heart,) the Memories of their Patrons, and the Atchievements of their Ancestors, from their first Rise. But these too, having no Learning at all, let any Man judge, what credit is to be given to them, all whose hopes and subsistence did depend on Soothing and Flattering of others. Besides, though what they deliver were most true, yet it would not much advance the <hi>Writer</hi> of an <hi>History:</hi> Lastly, let us consider, how often the <hi>Writers</hi> of such Famous Deeds as are past, are found in manifest Mistakes, how often they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves do Waver, Doubt, Fluctuate, and are at a loss, and how vastly some of them do differ from others, and not a few contradict themselves. If such Lapses are incident even to those, who seek after Truth, with great Labour and Study, what can we hope for, from such other Persons, who being without Learning (by which they who casually mistake, may be better informed, and those who mistake on purpose, may be confronted,) do trust their Memory, alone? I might allege, that the Memory is often times impaired by Disuse; it is weakned by Age; or wholly lost by some Diseases. Besides, if they have a desire to please their Patrons, (as it often comes to pass,) or, on the contrary, if they have a mind to cross them; or, if the Passions of Anger, Hatred, or Envy do intervene, (which pervert the Judgment,) Who can affirm any thing for Truth, upon such Mens Authorities? Or, Who would take the pains to
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:56771:28"/>
refute it, though it were False? Or, Who would deliver down for <hi>certain,</hi> what he received from such uncertain Authors? Wherefore, in so great a silence of old <note n="*" place="margin">Great uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the ancient Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>British</hi> Affairs, and the Reasons why?</note> 
               <hi>Writers,</hi> (concerning matters of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,) who were all so hugely ignorant, even of things acted in their own times, there being nothing assuredly true and sincere, I count it more modest, to be silent in what one knows not, than by devising Falshoods to betray ones own Ignorance, and to slight and despise the better Judgments of other Men.</p>
            <p>It follows then, that there was so great a scarcity of <hi>Writers</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst all the Nations of the <hi>Britains,</hi> that, before the coming in of the <hi>Romans</hi> thither, all things were buried in the profound Darkness of Silence, in so much, that we can get no Information of what was Acted, even by the <hi>Romans</hi> themselves, otherwise than from <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Monuments: And as for those things, which preceded their coming, we may believe rather their Conjectures, than our own Fictions. For what our <hi>Writers</hi> have delivered, every one concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Original of his own Sept or Nation, is so absurd, that I should have counted my time lost to go about to refel it, unless there were some who delighted in such Fables, as if they were as true as Gospel, and so prided themselves with the Ornaments of other Mens Feathers.</p>
            <p>Moreover, the disagreement of later <hi>Writers</hi> makes a great acces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to the difficulty of this Task, for they deliver such Repugnancies, that a Man cannot well tell, whom to follow; yea, there is such an absurdity amongst them, that all of them seem most deservedly fit to be rejected. Neither do I so much wonder at the Silence of the <hi>Ancients,</hi> in a matter so obscure, or the Dissonancy of <hi>later</hi> Writers in feigning Falshoods; as at the agreeing impudence of some few: For they write of those times, in which all things were dubious and uncertain, with so much positiveness and confidence, as if their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign were rather to court the Readers Ear, than to respect the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their Narrations.</p>
            <p>For in those first times, seeing the use of Tillage was not common, neither among the <hi>Britains,</hi> nor many other Nations; but all their Wealth consisted in Cattle, Men had no regard to their substance, which was very small, because they were either expelled from their Habitations by such as were more powerful than themselves; or, they themselves did drive out the weaker ones; or else, they sought out better Pasture for their Cattle in Wild and Desert places: Upon one or other of these Grounds, they easily changed, their Dwellings, and the Places, they removed to, with new Masters soon got new Names. Besides, the Ambition of the wealthier sort added much to the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, who, to perpetuate their Memory to Posterity, called Countrys, Provinces and Towns by their own Names. Almost all the Cities in <note n="*" place="margin">Several Countries have changed their Names.</note> 
               <hi>Spain,</hi> had two Names. The Names of the Inhabitants in It, and also the Names of the Cities and Countries therein, received frequent al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations. Not to speak of <hi>Egypt, Greece,</hi> and other remote <hi>Countries.</hi>

The <hi>Hebrews</hi> and <hi>Arabians</hi> keep their Old Words, almost in all Nations, which were not so much as heard of by other People. <hi>Scot,</hi> and <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi> are the common Names of the <hi>British</hi> Nations, which, at this day, are almost unknown to the <note place="margin">Or <hi>Highlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi>
               </note> Ancient <hi>Scots,</hi> and <hi>Britains</hi>; for they call the one <hi>Albines,</hi> the other <hi>Saxons.</hi> And therefore 'tis no wonder, if, in so great an uncertainty of Human Affairs, as to the Names of Men and Places; <hi>Writers,</hi> who were born at several times, far distant one from another, and having different Languages, and Manners too, do not always agree amongst themselves. Though these things have occasioned difficulties great enough, in search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the first Original of Nations, yet some of the Moderns too, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing acted by a Principle of Ambition, have involved all things in more thick and palpable darkness. For, whilst every one would fetch the <hi>Original</hi> of his Nation, as high as he could; and so endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to enoble it by devised Fables, by this immoderate Licence of coyning Fictions, What do they but <hi>obscure</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> That, which they ought to <hi>Illustrate</hi>? And, if at any time they speak <hi>Truth,</hi> yet, by their frequent and ridiculous Untruths, at other times, they detract from their own Credit; And are so far from obtaining that Esteem, which they hoped for, that, by reason of their Falshoods, they are laughed at, even by those, whom they endeavour'd to cajole into an Assent.</p>
            <p>To make this plain, I will first begin, as with the <hi>Ancientest</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, so, from the most notorious and impudent Falshood. They who compiled a <note n="*" place="margin">The Fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Origin of the <hi>Britains.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Here I cannot but stand amazed at their design, who might easily, and without any reflection at all, have imitated the <hi>Athenians, Arcadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and other famous <hi>Nations,</hi> and have called themselve, <note n="*" place="margin">Born in the same Country<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> where they live.</note> 
               <hi>Indigenae,</hi> see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it would have been no disgrace to them to own that Origin, which the Noblest and wisest City in the whole World counted her Glory; especially, since that Opinion could not be refuted out of Ancient <hi>Writers</hi>; and had no mean <hi>Assertors,</hi> besides; yet, that they had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther forge Ancestors to themselves, from the <hi>Refuse</hi> of all Nations, whom the very Series of the Narration itself did make suspected, even to the unskilful Vulgar; and also none of the Ancients, no, not by the meanest suspition, did confirm. Besides, if that had not pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, seeing it was free for them, (as some of the <hi>Poets</hi> have Writ) to have assumed Honourable Ancestors to themselves, out of any old Books; I wonder in my heart, what was in their Minds, to make choice of such, of whom all their posterity might justly be ashamed. For what great folly is it, to think nothing Illustrious, or Magnificent but what is Profligat and Flagitious, or, at least, but a size below it; yet some there are, that value themselves, among the ignorant, upon the score of such Trifles; as for <note place="margin">

In feigning of which, how uncircumspect they were, we may gather from hence, that they did not give a <hi>Greek</hi> Name, to that Grecian <hi>Gathelus,</hi> who was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed unknown to the <hi>Greek</hi> Writers; that they allotted a <hi>Latin</hi> Name, from an Haven or Port, to the City built by him rather than a <hi>Greek</hi> one, especially in those times, when <hi>Italy</hi> it self was known to few of the <hi>Greeks</hi>; that they doubt whether he were the Son of <hi>Argus,</hi> or of <hi>Cecrops</hi>; seeing <hi>Argus</hi> lived almost an Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years before <hi>Cecrops.</hi> That he, who had arrived at such a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure by his Prudence, even amongst the most ingenious Persons of the World, as to enjoy the Second place to the <hi>King,</hi> and to be put in <hi>Moses,</hi> the Fugitiv's, room; and besides, being a stranger, to be honoured with the Marriage of the <hi>Kings</hi> Daughter; that he, I say, leaving the fruitfullest Region in the World, and passing by the Lands of both <hi>Continents,</hi> both to the Right and Left, and also so many <hi>Islands</hi> all fruitful in Corn, and some of them also famous for the Temperature of the Air, as <hi>Crete, Sicily, Corsica, Sardinia,</hi> (which, at that time, were rather seiz'd than cultivated, and inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited by a wild sort of People,) should break out into the very Ocean, the very Name whereof was formidable, especially since Men had then but small skill in Marine Affairs; or, that he built the City of <hi>Port-Gathelus,</hi> or <hi>Port a Port,</hi> at the River <hi>Duero,</hi> the Name of which City was never heard of till the <hi>Sarazens</hi> obtain'd the Dominion of <hi>Portugal</hi>; also, that he built <hi>Braga,</hi> at the Mouth of the River <hi>Munda,</hi> seeing there is so many Miles distance between <hi>Braga</hi> and <hi>Munda</hi>; Two Rivers also being interjected betwixt them, <hi>viz. Duero</hi> and <hi>Vouga,</hi> or <hi>Vaca</hi>; and <hi>Braga</hi> it self is not altogether a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritime place: Moreover, I may well ask, how <hi>Gathelus</hi> a <hi>Grecian,</hi> born of a Noble Family; and besides, eminent for famous Deeds, seeing he was of a most ambitious Nation, in commending his Name
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:56771:32"/>
to Posterity, and being conveighed with a great Train into the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream parts of the World, and as then matters stood, almost rude and barbarous, having built <hi>Towns,</hi> did not impose his own, no not so much as a <hi>Greek,</hi> Name on them. For the Name of <hi>Portugal,</hi> or, (as some will have it,) the Port of <hi>Gathel,</hi> being unknown to so many Ancient Writers, who have professedly undertook to describe the Names of Countries, and Places, began to be celebrated but about Four Hundred years ago. And the silence of all the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins,</hi> concerning the coming of <hi>Gathelus</hi> into <hi>Spain,</hi> makes it much suspected, especially since the <hi>Ancients</hi> make notable and frequent mention of the <hi>Phaenicians, Persians, Carthaginians, Iberians, Gauls,</hi> and of the Companions of <hi>Hercules</hi> and <hi>Bacchus,</hi> who came into that Country. But our Fablers, (as I judge) never read the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents of the Ancients; if they had, seeing it was free for them to assume an Author and Founder of their Nation and Nobility, out of any of the <hi>Famous Grecians,</hi> they would never have pick'd up an Ignobler Person, for their Founder; passing by <hi>Hercules</hi> and <hi>Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> who were Famous amongst all Nations, and whom they might have cull'd out, as well as any other, for the Original of their Race.</p>
            <p>These are the things which our <hi>Writers</hi> have delivered, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Rise of our <hi>Nation,</hi> which, if I have prosecuted more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, than was necessary, it is to be imputed to them, who pertinaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously defended them, as a <note n="*" place="margin">

            <p>To begin then with the <hi>Brittons,</hi> whose Dominion was of largest extent in <hi>Albium:</hi> The first, that I know, who hath discovered any certainty concerning them, was <hi>C. Iulius Caesar.</hi> He thinks, that the inmost Inhabitants were <note n="(c)" place="margin">

               <hi>Indigenae,</hi> because, after diligent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, he could find nothing of their first comming thither; neither had they any Monuments of Learning, whence he might be infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.

               <hi>Belgae,</hi> whom hopes of Prey had allured thither, and the fruitfulness of the Soil, and mildness of the Air, had detained there. He thinks this a sufficient argument to confirm his Opinion, that many did retain the Names of the Cities, whence they came, and that their Buildings were like those of the <hi>Gauls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cornelius Tacitus,</hi> a grave Author, adds; that their Manners are not unlike, and that they are equally bold in running into Dangers, and as fearful how to get out of them; that there were great Factions and Sidings among them Both. And lastly, that <hi>Britain,</hi> in his time, was in the same State as <hi>Gaul</hi> was, before the coming of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.

               </note> 
               <hi>Ireland</hi>; I shewed before, that all the North side of <hi>Spain</hi> was possessed by <hi>Gallick</hi> Colonies. And there are many reasons assignable, why they might pass out of <hi>Spain</hi> into <hi>Ireland,</hi> for either the easie passage might be a great inducement; or else, the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled out of their Habitations by the excessive Power and Domina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Persians, Phaenicians,</hi> and <hi>Graecians,</hi> who, having over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> rendred them Weak and Obnoxious to their Oppression and Violence. Moreover, there were Causes amongst the <hi>Spaniards</hi> themselves, for they being a People cemented and made up of many Nations, and not well agreeing among themselves, the desire of Liberty, and the avoiding of Servitude, in the midst of Civil Wars and new Tumults, arising amongst a People that was greedy of War, might make them willing to depart: He that weighs these causes of Transmigration, will not wonder, if many of them did prefer a mean condition abroad, conjoyned with Liberty, before a Domestick and bitter Servitude, and when they were once arrived there, the State of <hi>Spain</hi> growing daily more and more Turbulent, made them willing there to abide; for sometimes the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> and sometimes the <hi>Romans,</hi> did exercise all the Miseries of Servility upon the Conquered <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and so compelled them to avoid those Evils, by a flight into <hi>Ireland,</hi> there being no other neighbour Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into which, either in their Prosperity they might so well trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port their over-abounding Multitudes; or else wherein, in adversity they might find a shelter against their Calamities. Besides, the Clemency of the Air did retain them there, for, as <hi>Caesar</hi> says, the Air of <hi>Britain</hi> is more temperate than That of <hi>France.</hi> And <hi>Ireland</hi> exceeds Both in goodness of Soil, and also in an equal Temperature of the Air and Climate. Besides, Men born and educated in a barren Soil, and given to Laziness besides, as all <hi>Spaniards</hi> are, being trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported almost into the richest Pastures of all <hi>Europe,</hi> no marvail, if they willingly withdrew themselves from homebred Tumults, into the bosome of a Peace beyond Sea. Notwithstanding all that I have said, yet I would not refuse the Opinion of any Nation concerning their Ancestors, provided it were supported by probable Conjectures, and ancient Testimony.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Tacitus,</hi> upon sure Conjectures, as he thinks, doth affirm, that the West side of <hi>Britain</hi> or <hi>Albium,</hi> was inhabited by the Posterity of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> But it is not probable, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> should leave <hi>Ireland</hi> behind them, being a Country nearer and of a milder Air and Soil, and first Land in <hi>Albium,</hi> but rather that they first arrived in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and from thence emitted their <hi>Colonies</hi> into <hi>Britain.</hi> And that the same thing happen'd to the <hi>Scots,</hi> all their <hi>Annals</hi> do testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie; and <hi>Bede, Lib.</hi> 1. doth affirm.

they returned into <hi>Ireland</hi>; and again, under their General <hi>Reutha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> they return'd into <hi>Britain.</hi> And afterwards in the Reign of <hi>Fergusius</hi> the Second, great aid of <hi>Irish-Scots</hi> were sent, who had their Quarters assigned in <hi>Gallaway.</hi> And <hi>Claudian</hi> in his time shews, That Auxiliaries were transmitted thence against the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>; for he says,

            <p>But, from whatsoever Province of <hi>Germany</hi> they came, I think it very probable, that they were of the ancient Colonies of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> who seated themselves either on the <note n="(h)" place="margin">The <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,</hi> or rather the <hi>Bothnick</hi> Sea or Gulph.</note>

               <hi>Walsch,</hi> (with them) signifies a <hi>Gaul,</hi> a Stranger, and a Barbarian, too. So that it is very credible, That the Ancestors of the <hi>Picts,</hi> either being expell'd by their Neighbors, or driven up and down by Tempests, were easily reconciled to the <hi>Scots</hi>; yea, were befriended and aided (as 'tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported) by them, as a People allyed to Them, almost of the sam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So that, it might easily come to pass, that thereupon they might mix their Blood, and, by Marriages, make a Coalition, as it were, into one Nation.

            <p>Neither is This to be omitted, That, before the coming of the <hi>Saxons</hi> into <hi>Britain,</hi> none of the <hi>British</hi> Nations used Interpreters to understand one another. Wherefore, seeing the <hi>Scotish, English</hi>

Neither ought it to seem strange to us, if the same Words do not signifie the same things in all Nations, if we consider, what alterations Commerce with neighbouring Countries doth daily make in the Speech of all Nations; and, how much change is made by daily Conversation with Foreigners; how many new Words are coined to express things, newly invented; how many are

And, to come nearer home; the <hi>English</hi> Laws of <hi>William</hi> the <hi>Norman,</hi> established Five Hundred years ago, and wrote in <hi>French</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> yet now no <hi>French</hi> Man can understand them, without an Interpreter. Nay, if those old Men, who have lived long in the World, can remember, that many Words are grown obsolete, which were in use when they were Children; and what Words unheard of by our Ancestors, have suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in their places; they will not at all wonder, that the same Original Language, in length of time, should be changed, and seem wholly different from it self; especially amongst Nations far remote, and also often warring one against another. On the other side, when I see that concord (lasting so many Ages rather than years,) in the <hi>British</hi> Language, and that even amongst Nations, either very di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant one from another, or else maintaining mutual Animosities a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst one another; such a concord, as is hardly to be found amongst many Tribes and People of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> who yet have long lived under the same Kings and Laws: I say, when I ponder within my self, such an agreement in Speech, which as yet preserves its ancient Affinity of Words, and no obscure markes of its Original; I am ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily induc'd to believe; that, before the coming in of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> all the <hi>Britains</hi> used a Language, not much different from each other; and it is probable, that the Nations, adjoyning to the <hi>Gallick</hi> shore, used the <hi>Belgick</hi> Tongue, from whose limits a good part of the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi> bordering on <hi>France,</hi> had made a Transmigration, as <hi>Caesar</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us. But the <hi>Irish,</hi> and the Colonies sent from them, being derived from the <hi>Celtae,</hi> Inhabitants of <hi>Spain,</hi> 'tis probable, they spake the <hi>Celtick</hi> Tongue. I suppose, that these Nations returning, as it were, from a long Pilgrimage, and possessing themselves of the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour-Seats, and almost coalescing into one People, did confound the Idioms of their several Tongues respectively; so that, it was neither wholly <hi>Belgick,</hi> nor wholly <hi>Celtick,</hi> nor yet wholly unlike to either of them: Such a mixture we may observe in those Nations, which are thought to speak the <hi>German</hi> Tongue, and yet have much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined

               <hi>Ancient Scots</hi> did divide all the Nations, inhabiting <hi>Britain,</hi> into two Sorts, the one they call <hi>Gael,</hi> the other <hi>Galle</hi> or <hi>Gald, i. e.</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my Interpretation, <hi>Gallaeci</hi> and <hi>Galli.</hi> Moreover the <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laecians</hi> do please themselves with that Title, <hi>Gael,</hi> and they call their Language (as I said before) <hi>Gallaecian,</hi> and do glory in it, as the more refin'd and elegant, undervaluing the <hi>Galli</hi> as <hi>Barbarians,</hi> in respect of themselves: And though originally the <hi>Scots</hi> called the <hi>Britains, i. e.</hi> the most Ancient Inhabitants of the Island, <hi>Galli</hi>; yet custom of speaking hath by degrees obtained, that they called all the <hi>Nations,</hi> which afterwards fixed their Seats in <hi>Britain</hi> by that Name, which they used rather as a Contumelious, than a National, one. For the Word <hi>Galle</hi> or <hi>Gald</hi> signifies That amongst them, which <hi>Barbarian</hi> doth amongst the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latins</hi>; and <hi>Walsch</hi> among the <hi>Germans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now at last we are come to this point, <hi>i. e.</hi> That we are to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate the Community of Speech, and thereupon an ancient <note n="*" place="margin">Another Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of Affinity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Gauls</hi> and <hi>Britains,</hi> from the Names of Towns, Rivers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> Affinity between the <hi>Gauls</hi> and the <hi>Britains,</hi> from the Names of <hi>Towns, Rivers, Countries,</hi> and such other Evidences. A Ticklish Subject, and to be warily handled; for I have formerly proved, that a publick Speech or Language may be altered for <hi>many</hi> Causes; for though it be not changed altogether, and at once, yet it is in a perpetual Flux, and doth easily follow the inconstancy of the alterers, by reason of a certain Flexibility, which it hath in its own Nature. The Truth whereof doth appear chiefly in those Ranks of things, which are subject not only to the Alterations of Time, but are also obnoxious to every Man's Pleasure or Arbitrement; such as are all particular things invented for the daily use of Mans Life, whose Names either grow obsolete, or are made new and refined, for very light and trivial Causes. But the Case is far different in those things, which are time-proof, and so, after a sort, are Perpetual or Eternal. As the Heavens, the Sea, the Earth, Fire, Mountains, Countries, Rivers; and also in those, which, by their Diuturnity, as far as the infirmity of Nature will permit, do in some sort imitate those per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual and uncorrupted Bodies; such are Towns, which are built as if they were to be Sempiternal. So that a Man cannot easily give Names to, or change the old of, <hi>Nations</hi> and <hi>Cities,</hi> for they were not <hi>rashly</hi> imposed at the beginning, but in a manner by general and deep advice and consent by their <hi>Founders,</hi> whom Antiquity did greatly Reverence, ascribing Divine Honour to them; and, as much as they could, making them <hi>Immortal.</hi> And therefore, these <hi>Names</hi> are deservedly continued, and receive no alteration without a mighty Perturbation of the whole Oeconomy of things, so that if the rest of a <hi>Language</hi> be changed, yet these are pertinaciously retained, and are never supplanted by other Names, but as it were, with unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingness and regret. And the cause of their imposing at first, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes much to their continuance. For those, who, in their <hi>Pere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grinations,</hi> either were forced from their <hi>old</hi> Seats; or, of their own accord, sought <hi>new</hi>; when they had lost their own Country, yet retained the <hi>Name</hi> thereof, and were willing to enjoy a Sound most pleasing to their Ears; and by this umbrage of a <hi>Name,</hi> such as it was, the want of their Native Soil, was somewhat alleviated and addule'd
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:56771:39"/>
softned unto them, so that thereupon they judged themselves not altogether <hi>Exiles,</hi> or <hi>Travellers,</hi> far from Home. And besides, there were not wanting some Persons, who, being superstitiously inclined, did conceive an Holier and more August Representation in their Minds, than could be seen in Walls and Houses, and did sweetly hug that Image and delightful Pledge of their <hi>own</hi> former Country, with a love, more than <hi>Native.</hi> And therefore, a surer Argument of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity is taken from This sort of Words, than from <hi>Those,</hi> which, on Trivial Causes, (and oft on none at all) are given to, or taken away from, ordinary and changeable Things. For though it may casually happen, that the same Word may be used in divers <hi>Countries,</hi> yet it is not credible, that so many <hi>Nations,</hi> living so far asunder, should fortuitously agree in the frequent imposing of the same Name.</p>
            <p>In the next place, Those Names succeed, which are derived from, or compounded of, the former Primitives. For, oft-times, the <note n="a" place="margin">Derivative Words shew the Affinity of a Language more than their Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives.</note> Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude of Declination and Composition doth more certainly declare the Affinity of a Language, than the very <hi>Primitive</hi> words thereof do; for these are, many times, casually given: But the <hi>Other,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing declined after <hi>one</hi> certain Mode and Form, are directed by one fixed Example, which the <hi>Greeks</hi> call <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>. And therefore this certain and perpetual manner of <hi>Nominal</hi> Affinity, (as <hi>Varro</hi> speaks) doth, after a sort, lead us to an Affinity of <hi>Stock,</hi> and old Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>Language.</hi> Moreover, there is a certain Observation to be made in all <hi>Primogenious</hi> Words, from whence we may know, which are <hi>foreinly</hi> introduced, and which are <hi>Patriots.</hi> For, as the Words <hi>Philosophia, Geometria,</hi> and <hi>Dialectica,</hi> though oft used by <hi>Latin</hi> Writers, yet have scarce any <hi>Latin</hi> Word of kin to them, or derived from them, from whence they may seem to draw their Original; so, on the other side, the Words <hi>Paradisus</hi> and <hi>Gaza,</hi> are used by the <hi>Greeks</hi>; and yet it appears by this, That they are Inquiline or <hi>Forein,</hi> because they can't shew any <hi>Original,</hi> nor any <hi>Progeny,</hi> derived from them, in the <hi>Genuin</hi> Greek Tongue.</p>
            <p>The same Observation may be also made in other <hi>Tongues,</hi> which will help us to judge, what Words are <hi>Domestick,</hi> and what are <hi>Adventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,</hi> or Forein. Let it suffice to have spoken thus much in <hi>General.</hi> Let us now propound Examples, concerning every <hi>Particular</hi> part; Where, First, we meet with those Words, which end in <hi>Bria, Briga</hi> and <hi>Brica.

                  <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> (says he,) and <hi>Cornelius Tacitus,</hi> Writers of so great diligence; as also <hi>Suetonius, Herodian,</hi> and other <hi>Romans,</hi> who have wrote of <hi>British</hi> Affairs, have, in no part of their Works, made men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Scots</hi> or <hi>Picts,</hi> and therefore doubtless, they had no Seats in <hi>Britain,</hi> in that Age. Wilt thou accept of this condition, <hi>Lud,</hi> that what Nation no Ancient <hi>Writer</hi> hath mentioned, never any such Nation was? If you embrace this Motion, see how many Nations you will exclude from their Beings in one or two lines? How great a Table of Proscriptions will you make?

               <p>I will propound another to you, and such an one too, as you ought not, and (I think) dare not, refuse. There is a certain kind of probation out of Fragments, out of which, if you a little harden your Forehead, you may prove any thing. I am the more inclined to make use of this way of Proof, because you seem to love it most of all, as proving (forsooth) out of a Fragment, known (I beleive) to thy self alone, that an innumerable Multitude of the <hi>Cimbri</hi> went forth to destroy the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire; I will therefore shew you out of a <hi>Fragment,</hi> that the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts</hi> were in <hi>Britain</hi> before <hi>Vespa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian</hi>'s Reign, which you deny. In that Book to which you have given the Title of <hi>Fragmentum Britannicae Descriptionis, i. e.</hi> A Frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Description of <hi>Britain</hi>; I think, especially for this Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, because you thought your self to have sufficiently proved, out of one of the two Fragments, that the <hi>Island</hi> was rather to be called <hi>Pritania,</hi> than <hi>Britannia</hi>; and out of the other, that you had dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorged such a multitude of <hi>Cimbri,</hi> as were enough to Conquer all <hi>Britain:</hi> For this cause, you thought that your Fragment would get credit enough on that single account. In that Book, you write<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> that the Name of <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts,</hi> together with the <hi>Franks</hi> and <hi>English,</hi> or <hi>Angles,</hi> were well known to the <hi>Roman</hi> World, and as a Witness of this Opinion, (a meet one indeed,) he produced <note n="*" place="margin">

speaking of the first coming of <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> into <hi>Britain,</hi> hath these Words; <hi>Moreover the Nation, as yet rude and dwelling in</hi> Britain, <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed to none but the Arms of the</hi> Picts <hi>and the</hi> Hiberns, <hi>or</hi> Irish, <hi>their half naked Enemies, did easily yeild to the Arms and Ensigns of the</hi> Romans. See, I pray, what <hi>Lud</hi> would infer out of this Testimony; First, that the <hi>Brittons</hi> alone did then inhabite the Island. Next, that the People there Named <hi>Hiberni</hi> or <hi>Irish,</hi> were afterward called <hi>Scots</hi>; but the Author of the <hi>Panegyrick</hi> doth assert neither of the two.

<q>First of all, the <hi>Island</hi> was inhabited by <hi>Brittons,</hi> whence it hath its Name, who from the <hi>Armorick</hi> Tract, as it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, being wafted over into <hi>Britain,</hi> possessed the South-parts thereof, and having seized upon the greatest part of the <hi>Island,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning from the South, it hapned that the Nation of the <hi>Picts,</hi> coming (as 'tis reported) out of <hi>Scythia,</hi> and entring into the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean, with long Ships, or Gallies, but not many, by stress of Wind and Weather, were driven beyond all the bounds of <hi>Britany</hi> into <hi>Ireland</hi>; and a little after, Wherefore the <hi>Picts</hi> coming into <hi>Britain,</hi> begun to seat themselves in the North parts of the <hi>Island:</hi> The Southern being possessed by the <hi>Brittons:</hi>

                  <hi>Scutabrigantes,</hi> we ought to read <hi>Scotobrigantes.</hi> Of how great Learning and Judgment that young Man is; of what industry in comparing ancient Writers; and of what acuteness in finding out the meaning of obscure Passages, the Books set out by him do declare. At present I shall only say, that having underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to illustrate the Affairs of <hi>Britain,</hi> I thought his Judgment was not to be omitted; and I will declare, in a few Words, why I think it to be true; for seeing we read in <hi>Caesar,</hi> and other <hi>Authors,</hi> emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent both for diligence and knowledge, that the <hi>Britains</hi> were wont to paint their Bodies with <hi>Woad</hi>; and in <hi>Herodian,</hi> that they used narrow Shields in War, (such as <hi>Livy</hi> ascribes to the <hi>Asiatick Gauls,</hi>) and no great Ornament in their Arms; it seem'd absurd, to make mention of the Sheild, which was not Painted, the mention of the Body, which was Painted, being omitted. Now the old <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi> were Painted, not for comliness, as other <hi>Nations,</hi> not a few were; but that their blewish colour might render them more ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible to their <hi>Enemies</hi> in Fight; but how that colour could appear terrible in a narrow Sheild, I do not understand. And therefore it is very probable, that that Learned Man, and Skilful in <hi>British Affairs,</hi> as who, according to <hi>Dion, kept the whole Island under Tribute,</hi> wrote the Word, <hi>Scotobrigantes,</hi> that he might distinguish them from the other <hi>Brigantes,</hi> both <hi>Spanish</hi> and <hi>Gallick.</hi> It makes also for the same purpose, that in those Verses he separates the <hi>Britains</hi> and <hi>Brigantes,</hi> as two different Nations, which is also done by some <hi>British</hi> Writers, who make <hi>Humber</hi> to be the boundary of <hi>Britain.</hi> This matter being not well considered by <note n="*" place="margin">

                  <hi>Albium.</hi> His mistake, though it may justly offend others, yet ought not to have been so severely censured by <hi>Ludd,</hi> who hath committed as great Mistakes in the same kind; for he makes the <hi>Cumbri,</hi> or (as he calls them) the <hi>Cumri,</hi> to issue out of a Corner of <hi>Britain,</hi> to plunder the whole World: For he infers from one or two Words, common to them both, that the <hi>Cimbri</hi> and <hi>Britanni</hi> were of one Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Those Words are <hi>Moremarusa</hi> and <hi>Trimarchia</hi>; Here it is worth the while to take notice of the Man's acuteness, in disputing, and of his subtilty (forsooth) in drawing out of Inferences and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions. This Word <hi>Moremarusa,</hi> says he, is a <hi>British</hi> Word,<note place="margin">Iron.</note> but it was once a <hi>Cimbrick</hi> one, and no Nations else besides, which dwelt by the <hi>Baltick</hi> Sea. But seeing our Country-Men use the same Word, and are called by the same Name with those other <hi>Cimbri,</hi> therefore (sure) both were of the same Stock and Nation.</p>
               <p>In this Matter, first he affirms Falshoods for Truths, and also takes Uncertainties for Certainties. For it is a manifest Untruth, That both of them are called <hi>Cimbri,</hi> even <note n="*" place="margin">

were so called by the <hi>Germans.

               <p>I will not here descend to a minute Inquiry, to what Children the <hi>Valli</hi> are wont to give the Names of the <hi>Cimbrick</hi> Kings; for this diligent Writer brings in This also as an Argument of their Stock.</p>
               <p>If I mistake not, besides <hi>Latin, German,</hi> and <hi>Syriack</hi> ones, he will find very few Names. But if a solid Argument may be fetched from the proper Names of Men, (which are often-times arbitrarily impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by Parents, or vain-gloriously adopted out of some <hi>History</hi>) then <hi>Ludd</hi> might rather persuade us, That his Country-Men are <hi>Iews, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> or <hi>Germans,</hi> than <hi>Cimbri</hi>: Or, if he would have advised his Compatriots to give Baptismal Names, fetched out of <hi>History,</hi> to their Children, within a few Years, he might transform his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-Men, into what Nation soever he pleased. But touching the Names of the <hi>Cimbrick</hi> Kings, which, he says, were accustomed to be given to Children; I would willingly have asked the Man, From what Oracle he received it? Unless I knew before-hand, that he never wants some <hi>Fragment,</hi> out of which he can prove what he list himself. But this I can't but admire, touching that <hi>Cimbrick</hi> Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, how all their Military Men being sent aboard, that within the space of Forty Years, (for it was about that Interval, between the <hi>Cimbrick</hi> War, and <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi>'s arrival in <hi>Britain,</hi>) your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of <hi>Vallia,</hi> should so soon recover to be so populous; especially, since, when <hi>Maximus</hi> drew forth a far lesser Number out of <hi>Britain,</hi> even, when it was in its most flourishing Estate, the <hi>Britains</hi> could, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver after, hold up their Heads, but they were brought into bitter Servitude by the <hi>Saxons</hi>: Or why <hi>Caesar,</hi> who, for his Age, might have made mention of the <hi>Cimbrick</hi> War, when he came into <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> being also a Learned Man, and a great Favourer of the <hi>Marian</hi> Party, did find out nothing, by Inquiry, concerning this <hi>Cimbrick</hi> Expedition. Lastly, I desire to know, Whether <hi>Ludd</hi> spoke in Jest or in Earnest, when he added, that the Affinity of Both the <hi>Cimbri</hi> might be inferred from their equal contempt of Gold and Silver? Here I would willingly ask of him, Whether he spake in Earnest, when he calls those <hi>Cimbrians,</hi> who did not only vex and plunder <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia</hi> or <hi>Gaul,</hi> and a part of <hi>Spain</hi> too, but in a manner wholly wasted

To examine the Nature of the Ocean and Tides, pertaineth not to this Work, and many have done it before. One thing I will add, and may safely avouch, that the Sea, no where in the World, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth and ruleth more freely, carrying by Violence so much River Water, hither and thither, and is not content to Flow and Ebb so far as the Banks, but inserteth and windeth it self into the Land, shooting into the Mountains and Cliffs, as to his own Chanel. Now, what manner of Men the first Inhabitants of <hi>Britanny</hi> were, <hi>Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign,</hi> brought in, or <hi>Born</hi> in the Land, as among a barbarous People, it is not certainly known. Their Complexions are diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and thence may some Conjectures be taken: For the Red Hair of the dwellers in <hi>Caledonia,</hi> and mighty Limbs, import a <hi>German</hi> Descent: The coloured Countenance of the <hi>Silures,</hi> and Hair most commonly Curled, and Site against <hi>Spain,</hi> seem to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a belief, that the old <hi>Spaniards</hi> passed the Sea, and possessed those places. The nearest to <hi>France</hi> likewise resemble the <hi>French,</hi> either, because they retain something of the Race, from which they descended; or, that in Countries butting together, the same aspects of the Heavens do yeild the same Complexion of Bodies<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> But generally it is most likely, the <hi>French,</hi> being nearest, did Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the <hi>Land.</hi> In their Ceremonies and Superstitious Persuasions, there is to be seen an apparent Conformity: The Language diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not much, like boldness to challenge and leap into Dangers: When Dangers are come, like fear in refusing them; saving, that the <hi>Britains</hi> make more shew of Courage, as being not mollifi'd yet by long Peace; for the <hi>French</hi> also were once, as we read, redoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in War, till such time, as giving themselves over to Peace and Idleness, Cowardise crept in, and Shipwrack was made both of Manhood and Liberty, together: And so it is also befaln to those of the <hi>Britains,</hi> which were subdued of old; the rest remain such, as the <hi>French</hi> were before. Their strength in the Field consisteth in Footmen; some Countries make War in Wagons also: The greater Personage guideth the Wagon, his Waiters and Followers Fight out of the same. Heretofore they were govern'd by <hi>Kings,</hi> now they are drawn, by Petty <hi>Princes,</hi> into Parties and Factions: And that is the greatest help we have, against those Puissant Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that they have no common Council together. Seldom it chanceth, that two or three States meet and concur to repulse the common danger: So, whilst one by one fighteth, all are subdued. The Sky is very Cloudy, and much given to Rain, without extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of Cold. The length of Days much above the measure of our Climate; the Nights light, and, in the furthermost part of the Island, so short, that, between the going out and coming in of the Day, the space is hardly perceived, and when Clouds do not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, they affirm, that the Sun-shine is seen in the Night, and that it neither Setteth nor Riseth, but passeth along, because, belike, the <note n="a" place="margin">Later A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:56771:50"/>
began to discourse the Miseries of Bondage, to lay their Injuries together, and aggravate them by Constructions and Inferences, as, That their Patience had profited them nothing, save only to draw heavier Burdens upon themselves, as Men willing to bear them. That, whereas in former times, they had only one King, now were there Two thrust upon them, the <hi>Lieutenant</hi> to suck their Blood, the <hi>Procurator,</hi> their Substance, whose disagreeing was the torment of the Subjects; and their agreement, their undoing; the one vexing by Souldiers and Captains; the other, by Wrongs and Indignities.

And, whereas in Field, he that spoileth is commonly stronger: Now, were they, by Cowards and Weaklings, for the most part dispossessed of their Houses, berest of their Children, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned to yeild Soldiers for other Mens behoof, as though they were Men, that knew to do nothing else, save only to die for their own Country. For otherwise, what a small handful of Souldiers were come over, if the <hi>Britains</hi> would fall to reckon themselves: That <hi>Germany</hi> had so shakt of the Yoke, having no <hi>Ocean</hi> Sea, but only a River, for their Defence. That their cause of taking Arms was Urgent and Just; their Wives and Children, their Parents and Country; that the <hi>Romans</hi> had nothing to move them to War, but their own Covetousness and wanton Lust: And that they would doubtless depart, as <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> had done, if the <hi>Britains</hi> would imitate the Virtues of their <hi>Progenitors,</hi> and not be dismayed with the doubtful event of one Skirmish or two.

There is not a <hi>Bee</hi> amongst them; and if a Man bring of the Dust, or the little Stones from thence, and strow them among Bee-hives, the Swarms forsake their Combs. The Sea, that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Britain,</hi> is stormy and rough most part of the year, so that it can hardly be sailed over, but a few days in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer time.

His first and chief Care, was, to erect Bridges on the Marish Grounds, that so his Soldiers might stand safely, and fight as upon firm ground; for many places in <hi>Britain</hi> are Marishy, because of the frequent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>washings of the <hi>Ocean.</hi> The Barbarians themselves do swim through these <hi>Moors</hi> or <hi>Marishes,</hi> and run up to the Groins in them, (not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding the Mud,) with their naked Bodies.

And besides, they mark their Bodies with various Pictures, and with the shapes of all manner of Animals, and therefore they cloath not themselves, lest they should hide the painted outside of their Bodyes. But they are a very warlike Nation, and greedy of slaughter, being contented only with a narrow Shield, and a Lance. And moreover, they wear a Sword hanging down from their naked Bodies, and are whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ignorant of the use of Coats of Male, or Helmets, as judging them to be an hindrance and a luggage to them, in passing over the <hi>Marishes,</hi> whose Vapors, being exhaled by heat, make the Air there always dark and misty.</p>

It was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to the Ancient <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans.</hi> And their Posterity did doubt, whether it were a <hi>Continent</hi> or an <hi>Island</hi>; and many Writers who were ignorant of the Truth, as having not seen it themselves, nor had any Information from the Inhabitants, (but spoke only by Conjectures) in their <hi>Records,</hi> as their Leisures and Humours were, some counted it One, some the Other. But, in process of time, when <hi>Agricola</hi> was Chief Commander, and afterwards in the time of <hi>Severus</hi> the <hi>Emperor,</hi> it was clearly found out, to be an <hi>Island. Caesar,</hi> when he had setled things in <hi>France</hi>; and subdued the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rini,</hi> desired to pass over thither, and accordingly he transported his Foot, where it was most convenient, but he Landed not where he ought to Land. For the Fame of his coming being noised a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, all the <hi>Britains</hi> had prepossessed the passages of the <hi>Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent.</hi> But he, sailing beyond a Prominent Rock, made his descent elsewhere, and, repulsing those who first hindred his Landing, he put his Men on Shore before many of the <hi>Britains</hi> could unite to impede him; and afterwards he repelled their Aids too, which came in, conquered their Garisons, and mastered the Island. Yet not many of the <hi>Barbarians</hi> were slain, for they, fighting on Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, and out of Chariots, did easily avoid the <hi>Romans.</hi> (who had then no Horse Forces.) But being amazed at those things, which were related concerning them out of the Continent, and that they were so bold as to transport themselves, and make their descent into their Island, they sent some of the <hi>Nation</hi> of the <hi>Morini,</hi> their Friends and Allies, in Embassy to <hi>Caesar.</hi> First of all, <hi>Caesar</hi> demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Hostages, and they promised it. But afterward perceiving, that the Naval Force of the <hi>Romans,</hi> both those near at hand, and farther off, were shattered by Tempest, they changed their Minds, yet they did not openly set upon them, (for their Camp was well guarded) but having surprized some of them, who were sent in a peaceable manner, to provide things necessary, they put them almost all to the Sword; excepting some, whom <hi>Caesar,</hi> speedily sending forth other Forces, relieved; and presently, they make an onset on his Camp, but were shamefully repulsed, without effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing, yet they came not to Terms with <hi>Caesar,</hi> till they had been often worsted by him; and on the other side, <hi>Caesar</hi> had no great mind to make a League with them. But the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being now at hand, and his Forces not then sufficient to carry on the War, many of those which he brought over, being dead, or slain; and besides, the <hi>Gauls,</hi> in his absence, were attempting alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, he clapt up a Peace with them, in a manner against his Will, demanding many Hostages, but receiving a few only. Thus was he wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

and settled Affairs, neither reaped he any publick or private ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage from <hi>Britain,</hi> worth his Labour; but that he had assaulted it by Arms. For this very reason, he was much pleased in himself, and his Friends did mightily extol him at <hi>Rome.</hi> For when, they saw, that Places, before unknown, were now brought to light; and being before never heard of, were now discovered, they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced their Hopes, as if they had been Enjoyments, and anteda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their success, they rejoyced, as if they had already obtained their desired Conquest, and therefore they decreed Supplications to the <hi>Gods</hi> for Twenty days.</p>

They, hearkning to their advice, erect a <hi>Wall,</hi> as enjoined, not so much with <hi>Stones,</hi> as <hi>Turfs,</hi> but having no eminent <hi>Artificers,</hi> fit for such an undertaking, it was good for little. They made it between the two Seas, or <hi>Bays</hi> (of which I lately spake) of the Sea, for many Miles; that so, where the Waters were not a Defence, there, by the advantage of the Wall, they might secure their Borders from the Inrodes of their Enemies. The evident Marks and Footsteps of this high Wall, and Work, do remain to this day. It begins at almost a Mile distant from the Monastery of <hi>Kebercurnig,</hi> toward the West, in a place called, in the <hi>Picts</hi> Language, <hi>Panuachel,</hi> but in the <hi>English, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueltima,</hi> and bending against the West, it is terminated by the City <hi>Alcluyth.</hi> But their former Enemies, as soon as they percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers were departed, being carried in Ships, brake into their Borders, killing and spoiling all before them; and, as if they were Corn ready for the Sickle, they Mow, Trample upon, and Destroy them.

which, according to Command, arriving in Autumn, made a great Slaughter of their Enemies, and drove all that made their escape, beyond the Seas, who, the year before, drove all their Preys beyond those Seas, without any Resistance. Then the <hi>Romans</hi> told the <hi>Britains,</hi> That they could come no more, on such chargeable and toilsome Expeditions, for their Defence, but they advised them to take Arms themselves, and Fight with their Enemies; that, were it not for their Sluggishness, they might be as Valiant as They. Moreover, they thought it advantageous to their Allies, whom they must leave, that a Wall was drawn directly from Sea to Sea, between the Cities, which were there built for fear of Enemies, where also <hi>Severus</hi> made a Trench. This Wall they built accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly with firm Stone, both with the publick and private Purse, (as is yet to be seen) taking to their Assistance a Company of the <hi>Britains.</hi> It was Eight Foot broad, and Twelve high, in a direct line from East to West. Both are yet to be seen, after they had built it, they gave strict charge to the Inhabitants, for their self-Defence, and afforded them Examples for the Training up in Arms; but in the South shore, where their Ships were lodged, because from thence they feared the Irruptions of the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> they ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Towers, at proper distances, for the prospect of the Sea, and so they took their leaves, as never intending to Return.</p>

            <p>
               <q>In short, they fly, and are dispersed, leaving their Cities and Walls; their Enemies follow, and make more cruel Slaughters than ever before. For, as Lambs are devoured by Wolves, so were the poor Country-Men torn in pieces by their Enemies; so that, being ejected out of their Habitations, and in danger to be Starved, they exercised Robberies, and mutual Rapacities, to keep themselves alive. Thus they increased external Slaughters, by Domestick Broils, till all the Country was quite despoiled of Food, but what was got by Hunting.</q>

            <head>The Fourth BOOK.</head>
            <p>HAving undertook to write the History of our Nation, that the Series thereof might appear more plain to the Reader; I have, in my former Books, premised a few ancient Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs, and especially Those, which are freest from Fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Vanities, and are also most Consonant to Old Writers.</p>
            <p>First of all, it is constantly reported, and there are many Eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to confirm the same, That a great multitude of <note n="a" place="margin">A Colony of <hi>Spaniards</hi> come into <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Spaniards,</hi> being driven out of their own Country, by their powerful <hi>Dons</hi>; or else, voluntarily departing, by reason of their superabounding populous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, transported themselves into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and seized upon those Places of that Island, which were nearest to them. Afterward, the healthiness of the Air, and the fatness of the Pasturage, invited many others to follow them; especially, seeing their Seditions at home, and the Injuries offered them by Foreigners, (to which <hi>Spain</hi> was always subject) drew many thither, in hopes of a quieter Life, (which Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age they were more easily persuaded to undertake) because, they looked upon themselves as going into an Island already possessed by their own People, and, by that means, as it were, their second Country. This Stock of <hi>Spaniards</hi> did so flourish and increase, in a Country fit for Propagation, that now they were not contented within the bounds of <hi>Ireland,</hi> but frequently made Emigrations into the lesser Islands, near adjacent.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the <hi>Scots</hi> (for that was the general Name of the whole Nation,) propagating their bounds through the Islands of <hi>Aebudae,</hi> and dispersing themselves by Tribes and Kindreds, without either King or fixed Government: A <note n="b" place="margin">A <hi>German</hi> Fleet is driven into the <hi>Aebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dae.</hi>

               <hi>German,</hi> or, as <hi>Bede</hi> writes, a <hi>Scythian</hi> Fleet, came to the Coasts of <hi>Ireland,</hi> being driven thither, 'tis very probable, by stress of Weather; for they had not their Wives or Children aboard with them. They, being very Poor, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving nothing left them, by reason of so long a Voyage, but only their Arms, sent Ambassadors to the <hi>Scots,</hi> desiring them, that they might inhabit amongst them. Answer was sent them, That they themselves were compelled to seek their Habitations in those small Islands; which, by reason of the Barrenness of the Soil, were also Unfruitful; and, if it were otherwise, yet all of them, if they should forsake them quite, would not be sufficient to entertain so great a multitude. But in regard, they pitied the common Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Mankind, and were particularly affected with their Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whom Divine Providence had so grievously afflicted; and who did not seem to be wholly Strangers to their Lineage, (as by their Language and Customs appeared,) they would therefore give them their Advice, and, as far as they were able, would assist them to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute it. Their Advice to them, was, to Sail to their Neighbour Island, <hi>Albium,</hi> which was large and fruitful, and, in many places, then uninhabited; and also, by reason of the Condition of those Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants that were in it, who were under several Kings, at fewd one

with another; and, consequently, very weak. That amidst those Discords, 'twere easy for them, by supporting the weaker side, to make themselves Masters of that large Country; and that in this matter, they would afford them their assistance.</p>

               <hi>Aebudae,</hi> and the Lowness of their own Condition, for so it then was, made them give ear to this Counsel. So that these <hi>Germans</hi> (which were afterwards, both by the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> and their Neighbor-Nations, called <note n="d" place="margin">

               <hi>Picts</hi>) Landing upon the Coasts of the Island, bordering on the <hi>German</hi> Sea, having expelled the Inhabitants, which were but few, and those at mutual Discord amongst themselves, they brought a great part of that District un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Subjection; and, soon after, in prosecution of the Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with the <note n="e" place="margin">
                  <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Germans</hi> joyn in affinity.</note> 
               <hi>Scots,</hi> so happily begun, they took Wives from amongst them, and so were, in a manner, compacted into one Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with them. By this mutual Intercourse betwixt them, a great many <hi>Scots,</hi> being either detained by their Allies, who were yet but weak; or else, driven by Want and Penury; or, for loss of their Relations, fixed their Habitations amongst the <hi>Picts</hi>: The <hi>Picts,</hi> at first, were glad of their coming; but, when they grew numerous, by degrees, they began to fear, lest, if the <hi>Scots</hi> increased in strength, they would become their Masters; So that, First in their secret As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblings, and afterward in their publick Councils, they muttered, That Care was to be taken, That no stranger should hereafter be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixed amongst them: And some Way was to be found, that the number of those, who were already admitted, might be lessened. A Rumor also was spread abroad, that it was revealed from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the <note n="f" place="margin">A <hi>Pictish</hi> Prophecy.</note> 
               <hi>Picts, That their Nation should in time be extirpated by the</hi> Scots. These Suspitions caused the Two Nations, which before were very amicable, to part companies. The <hi>Scots</hi> betook themselves to the Mountainous places, which were less fit for Culture, in regard they were more addicted to Pasturage, and Hunting: And the <note n="g" place="margin">
                  <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts</hi> fall out, and divide their Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</note> 
               <hi>Picts</hi> possessed the Low-lands, which were more fertile, and fit for Tillage, situate near the <hi>German</hi> Sea. Thus their Friendship, before contracted by so many mutual Kindnesses, did soon break forth into a terrible Civil War. For the Seeds of a deadly hatred were sown between those Two Nations, both of them being of fierce Dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, thÃ´ the occasion, at first, was but trivial, as some little Pets, Chidings, and some few Injuries sustained.</p>
            <p>The <note n="h" place="margin">The <hi>Brittons</hi> foment the Divisions between the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts.</hi>

               <hi>Brittons,</hi> being Enemies to both Nations, having got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten this opportunity, fomented the Dissensions; and did free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offer Aid to the <hi>Picts,</hi> even before they desired it, against the <hi>Scots.</hi> When the <hi>Scots</hi> perceived, That these things were in Agitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on against them, they sent elsewhere for Aid, and procured a Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign King to assist them against so imminent a Danger.

Just about the same time, a Rumour was dispers'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:56771:56"/>
which came to the Ears both of the <note n="k" place="margin">The Army of the <hi>Picts</hi> and <hi>Scots</hi> at a stand.</note> 
               <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts,</hi> That the <hi>Brittons</hi> were managing some ambiguous Counsels, equally perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious both Nations; and, That they would set upon the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and Conquerors together, with their Arms, and, destroying both, or else, driving them out of the Island, they Themselves would enjoy the Whole. This Report made both Armies doubtful, What course to take; and, for a time, kept them both within their Trenches. At length they came to a Treaty, and, perceiving the secret Fraud of the <hi>Brittons,</hi> they inclined to make Peace one with another; which being confirmed, the Three different Armies Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned home. The <hi>Brittons,</hi> having failed in their first Project, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt another Wile. They privily sent in Robbers amongst the <hi>Picts,</hi> who drove away their Cattle; when the <hi>Picts</hi> demanded Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, they answered, That they should seek it from the <hi>Scots,</hi> who were accustomed to Thieving and Plundering, rather than from Them. Thus they eluded the Ambassy, and sent away their Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors, without their Errands; so that the Matter did appear to be a plain Mockery. Their fraudulent Counsels being thus more and more discover'd,<note n="l" place="margin">The <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts</hi> unite against the <hi>Brittons.</hi>
               </note> the late reproach did incense the Hearts of Both Nations against them, more than the Relicks of their Anger, for their former Injuries; and therefore, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying as great an Army as they could, both Kings, Two several ways, invaded the Coasts of the <hi>Brittons,</hi> and, destroying the Country with Fire and Sword, returned home with a great Booty. To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge this Loss, the <hi>Brittons</hi> enter <hi>Scotland,</hi> and came as far as the River <hi>Don,</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Or <hi>Down,</hi> in Kyle.</note> and having ravaged the Country thereabouts, with greater Terror than Loss to the Inhabitants, they pitched their Tents upon the Bank of the River. <hi>Fergus,</hi> having sent their Wives and Children, and other portable things, into the Mountains, and Places inaccessible for Armies, secured all the Avenues, till the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the <note n="m" place="margin">And actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally joyn.</note>

The <hi>Brittons,</hi> either being detained by home-bred Dissensions, or, not thinking it adviseable or safe, to lead their Army into such difficult and almost inaccessible Places, where they could meet their Enemies with no Forces more numerous than they had to oppose them, did by their slow Actings, increase the boldness of their Contrariants.

but attempting it with less Caution than such a Butchery required, he was taken in the very Fact, by some of <hi>Galdus</hi> his Train, with a naked Fauchion in his Hand; being Arraigned and put to the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he confessed the Author, and the designed order of the whole Conspiracy, and so was executed immediately. When this wicked Plot was divulged abroad, there was a general Combination of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all sorts of People against the King, insomuch, that having slain many of those who were Panders to his Lust, as they could be found; at last they endeavoured to make their way to the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, the Source and Fountain of their Mischief. In the mean time, <hi>Conanus,</hi> one of the Kings Parasites, a Man meanly descended, but highly Respected and Trusted by his Master, levied some Troops, and had the Confidence to send them forth against the Nobles, but being forsaken of his Men, he was taken and Hang'd.

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:56771:63"/>
and plundered the neighboring Countries of the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts,</hi> until he came to the River <hi>Tay</hi>; And thÃ´ his Army was much distressed by Tempest, yet he had time to build Forts in all places convenient for Defence, by which means he defeated the Designs of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and withal, brake their Force. For before, the Adverse party, being Men inured to hardship, what they lost in the Summer, would many times recover in Winter, when the <hi>Roman</hi> Legions were dispersed into Winter Quarters: And somtimes, they would assault, and take, their Enemies Castles and Garisons, being not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently fortified. But at that time, by the cunningness of <hi>Agrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa</hi> in Building his Forts, and by his skill in making them defensible; and withal, by relieving them with his Forces, every Year; Their Arts were deluded. In the Fourth Year of his Government, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, that the <hi>Firths</hi> of <hi>Forth,</hi> and of <hi>Clyd,</hi> were seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red but by a small Tract of Land, having fortified that Place with Garisons, he spoiled the Countries bending to the <hi>Irish</hi> Sea.

By this prudence of <hi>Agricola,</hi> the <hi>Scots,</hi> and <hi>Picts,</hi> being shut up in a narrow Angle, and secluded from any commerce with the <hi>Britains,</hi> prepared themselves for the last shock and ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter; Neither was <note n="*" place="margin">

For his Enemies understanding his Design, did with their whole Army assault one of his Legions by night, and having killed the Sentinels, had almost taken his whole Camp: But being prevented by the coming in of other Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, after they had fought desperately till Day light, at length, being put to flight, they returned into the Mountains and Woods. Those things were acted about the Eighth Year of his Expeditions. Both Parties prepare themselves, as for their last Encounter, against the next Spring: The <hi>Romans,</hi> as judging that the Victory would put an end to the War. And their Enemies looking upon their <hi>All</hi> to be at stake; and, that they were about to fight for their Liberty, Lives, and for whatsover is to be accounted Dear and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred amongst Men: Hereupon, judging, that, in former Battels, they were overcome by Stratagem, rather than by Valour, they betook themselves to the higher Grounds, and, at the foot of Mount <hi>Grampius,</hi> waited for the coming of the <hi>Romans.</hi> There a bloody
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:56771:63"/>
Fight was begun betwixt them. The Victory was a great while ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering, and uncertain; at last, all the valiant Men of the <hi>Caledo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> being slain, the rest having their Courage cooled, were forced to retreat to their Fastnesses. After this Battel, there was no doubt at all, but that <hi>Agrippa</hi> would have subdued all <hi>Britain,</hi> by the force of his conquering Arms, if he had not been called home by <note n="*" place="margin">But being recalled by <hi>Domitian,</hi> the <hi>Caledonians,</hi> beat the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> out of their Country.</note> 
                  <hi>Domiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> not for the Honour of his Victories, as was pretended, but for his Destruction and Death. After his departure, Sedition arose in the <hi>Roman</hi> Camp, and the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts</hi> being glad of the occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and somewhat encouraged thereby, began to creep out of their lurking Places; and perceiving, that the <hi>Romans</hi> had not a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, nor the same Camp-Discipline, as before; they sent Envoys up and down, to try the Inclination, not only of their own Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, but of the <hi>Brittons</hi> also. Thus, in the first place, being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldned by some small successful Skirmishes, they began to take heart, and to assault Garisons; and at last, with a formed Army they resolved to venture the hazard of a pitched Field. By this means, The <hi>Romans</hi> were expelled out of their Territories, and were forced, with doubtful success, to contend with the <hi>Britains</hi> for their ancient Province. <hi>Galdus</hi> having obtained respite from War, made his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress all over the several Countries of the Land, and resetled the old Owners in their Habitations, which had been almost destroyed by the War; As for the Places which were wholly void, he sent his Soldiers to inhabit them. And having restrained the frequent Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beries which were wont to be committed, he composed the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, which began to arise betwixt Him and the <hi>Picts.</hi> At length, in great Glory and Endearment, both with Friends and Foes, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased, in the 35th Year of his Reign.</p>

                  <hi>Mogaldus</hi> was elected King, the Nephew of <hi>Galdus,</hi> by his Daughter: In the beginning of his Reign, he equalled the best of Kings; but, growing older, he was tainted with Vices, and easily degenerated into the Manners of his Uncle. When he first entred on the Government, that he might, with greater Faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, cure the vitious Practices committed by the former King, which did even contaminate the Publick Manners, he made Peace with his Neighbors, he restored the Ancient Ceremonies in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which had been carelesly neglected: He banished all Pimps of Lust, and Debauchery, from Court, and acted all things by the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Estates, according to the Ancient Custom; by which Deportment he procured to himself Love at home, and Reverence abroad. Having setled Matters at home, he turned his Mind to Warlike Affairs, and drove out the <hi>Romans</hi> from the Borders of his Kingdom; and, by his Auxiliaries, assisted the <hi>Picts</hi> against the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries of the <hi>Romans:</hi> Yea, in some prosperous Battels, he so weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the <hi>Roman</hi> Power amongst the <hi>Britains,</hi> that They also were erected to some hopes of recovering their Liberty, and thereupon took up Arms in many places. And their hopes were encreased, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Emperor <hi>Adrian</hi> had called back <hi>Severus,</hi> a fierce and skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Warrior, out of <hi>Britanny</hi> into <hi>Syria,</hi> to quell the Seditions of the <hi>Iews</hi>; so that <note n="b" place="margin">

               <p>Hereupon the <hi>Roman</hi> Province was quieted, the Excursions of their Neighbors were prevented, and Peace was observed between them, for a great while. The <hi>Britains</hi> did easily embrace it, and the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts</hi> had thereby opportunity to divide the Neighboring Lands as a Prey, amongst themselves. But that Peace, besides the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice it did to the Body, by weakening its Vigor, through Sloth and
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:56771:64"/>
Idleness, did also enervate the Mind, by the Baits of Pleasure, which then began to tickle it: For hereby <hi>Mogaldus,</hi> till then Unconquered in War, forgetting the Glory of his Ancestors, ran headlong into all kind of Vice; and, besides other pernicious and foul Miscarriages, prejudicial to the Publick, he made a most unjust Law, <note n="c" place="margin">The Law to forfeit ones whole Estate for Treason, without al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Wife or Children, made in <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galdus</hi>'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Afterwards, there was a Cessation of Arms for many Years, as if a silent Truce had been made.

And <hi>Conarus,</hi> who loved nothing in War, but the Licentiousness obtein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereby, made haste to return home, That he might imploy that Vacancy wholly to immerge himself in Pleasures: Whereupon, those Vices, which he had before concealed, on design to gain the Love of others, began now to appear bare-faced. And when, by this Dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulating Art, he judged the Kingdom sure to him, what his Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:56771:65"/>
had gotten by great Pains and Labour, he did as profusely spend, on his own Lusts and Pleasures; insomuch, that, in a very short time, he was reduced to great want. So that, convening an Assembly of the Estates, he made a long and plausible Oration of the Grandeur and Magnificence which was necessary for Kings; and complained of the Lowness of his <note n="g" place="margin">

Thus covering his Vices under the cleanly Names of Gallantry and Magnificence; and he was also an earnest Suitor, That a Valuation of every Mans Estate should be made, and a proportionable Tax imposed on each Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual. This Speech was unacceptable to all that heard it, whose An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer was, That the Matter was of more Moment than to be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined on a sudden: Whereupon, the Estates, having obtained a short time for Consultation, upon asking every particular Mans O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, they soon found, That this new Device of demanding such a vast Sum of Money, did not proceed from the Nobles, <note n="h" place="margin">Which are denied by the Commons, and their Reasons why?</note> but from some Court-Parasites; whereupon, they Voted, That the King should be kept Prisoner, as unfit to Reign; until, upon his Abjura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Government, they did substitute another. When they met the next Day, he, who was first demanded to give his Vote, made a sharp Speech and Invective against the Life of the former King, saying, That Bawds, Parasites, Minstrels, and Troops of Harlots, were not fit Instruments for Kings and Kingdoms, as being useless in War, and troublesom in Peace; besides, they were costly and full of Infamy and Disgrace. He added, The Complaint was false, That the King's Revenue and Incom were not sufficient for his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence; for a great many of their former Kings, who were famous Warriors, and formidable to their Enemies, had lived Nobly and Splendidly upon it, in time of Peace. But if any Prince be of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, That the Publick Revenue was too short, then, said he, let a Supplement be made, not out of the Subjects Purse, but out of his own Domestick Parsimony. He further added, That the Measure of Expence was not to be taken from the Lust and Exorbitant De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires of Men, which were infinite, but from the Ability of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and the Real Necessities of Nature. And therefore it was his Opinion, That those Villains, upon whom the Publick Patrimony was conferred, and for whose sake the King had undone so many Worthy Persons of good Rank and Quality, by despoiling them of their Estates, and putting them to Death, should be compelled to refund That to the Lawful Owners, which, by their Flatteries, they had unjustly robbed them of; and that also they should be further punished, to boot. In the mean time, he advised, that the King should be kept a Prisoner, till they could substitute another, that would not only inure himself to Thrift, but also teach others, by his Example, to live hardly and parsimoniously, as his Forefathers had done, that so the strict Discipline, received from our Ancestors, might be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Posterity.</p>
               <p>This Speech, as it was sharp enough of it self, so it seemed more cutting to those, who had Velvet Ears, and were unaccustomed to hear such free and bold Discourses, before. Neither did the King endeavour to allay the Heats of his People, by fair and gentle Words,

                  <hi>Argadus,</hi> a Nobleman, was made Vice-Roy, till the People could conveniently meet, to set up a New King. He, though, in the beginning of his Administration, he set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led all things with great Equity, and thereby had procured much Commendation by his moderate Deportment; yet, his Mind being corrupted by Prosperity, he soon lost all the Credit of his former praise-worthy Life.

These things being laid to his Charge in a Publick Assembly, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he was much blamed for his so sudden Degeneration and Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, he was altogether ashamed, and knowing them to be True, he brake forth into Tears; and as soon as his Weeping gave him liberty to speak, being unable to purge himself from the Objected Crimes,<note place="margin">but, upon his Repentance, is continued in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</note> he craved Mercy, and humbly deprecated the punishment of his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences; <hi>Which,</hi> said he, <hi>if I can obtain, I will recompense, and make amends for my Errors in Government, by my future Care, Industry and Valour.</hi> These things he humbly supplicated upon his Knees, so that the Anger of the Nobles being now turned into Pity, they lifted him up from the Ground, and ordered him to continue in the Government, remitting his own Punishment to himself. As for Them, they were well enough satisfied, if he did now truly and heartily repent of what he had done amiss heretofore. From that Day forward, <hi>Argadus</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled the Wisest Men of the whole Kingdom about him, and act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing but by their Advice; yea, during the <note n="l" place="margin">Which he managed equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably, for the remainder of his Magistracy.</note> Remainder of his Magistracy, he Enacted many Laws for the Good of the Publick; of which This was the chief; That he restrained the Arbitrariness of Provincial Judges, and forbad them to give Sentence against all Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders, <hi>alike</hi>; but to have respect to alleviating Circumstances, where any such were. He either restrained, or put to Death, Flagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Persons, and amended the Publick Manners, which had been corrupted by a long course of Licentiousness, not only by inflicting Legal Punishments on Transgressors of the Laws, but by affording them the Leading Example of his own Regular Life.

                  <hi>Ethodius,</hi> perceiving the disadvantage of the Place for his Enemy, disposed of his Guards in fit Avenues; and also made a Wall and a Graft at the mouth of the Passage; by which means they were brought to that extreme Penury of all things, that they were forced to yield up themselves to the King, at discretion.

He, by the terrour and weight of his Authority, and also, by present Punishments inflicted, quelled all intestine Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and rightly conceiving, that the Souldiery, who were before wanton and idle, and spoiled by Luxury, might be made more ready to resist an Enemy, he caused a Muster to be made of them, and so accustomed them to Training and Exercising their Arms, and Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Discipline, that, in a short time, the new-listed Tyroe's did equal the Valour of the Veterans, and old Souldiers.

                  <hi>Severus</hi> the Emperor, falling out in his time, did mightily disturb all his Measures, both Publick and Private.

In the mean time, the Enemy despair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of success, if they should Fight so great a Multitude in a pitch'd Battel, did here and there leave Herds of their Cattle, on purpose, as a Prey to them, that so they might stop the <hi>Romans,</hi> who, in hopes of such Booties, were inticed to stray far from their Camp: And, indeed, the <hi>Romans,</hi> besides those, that being thus dispersed, were taken in the Ambushes laid for them, were also much preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced by continual Rains; and, being wearied with long Marches, and so not able to follow, were in many places slain by their own Fellows, that so they might not fall alive into the Hands of their Enemies. Yet, notwithstanding, though they had lost 50000 of their Souldiers, (as <hi>Dion</hi> writes) they did not desist from their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize, till they had pierced even to the End and extream Bounds of the Island. As for <hi>Severus</hi> himself, though he was Sick, during this whole Expedition, and thereupon was fain to be carried in a covered Horse-Litter; yet, by his incredible Obstinacy and Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, he made his Enemies to accept of Conditions of Peace, and to yield up to him no small part of their Country.

Yea, sometimes, Stones with Inscriptions on them are found, which shew, that it was a <hi>Roman</hi> Pile of Building.

Neither did he manage the Kingdom any better than he got it. For sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the Nobility, which, in the Parliaments of the Kingdom, he had found to be adverse to him, he Governed all by the Ministry of <hi>Plebejans,</hi> whom Audaciousness and Penury (he knew) would ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily incline to any wickedness. Besides those Suspicions I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, he was encountred with a far more grievous one; for, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting Letters directed to some of the Chief Nobles, he understood by them, That <hi>Dorus,</hi> and the Children of <hi>Athirco,</hi> were yet alive, and were brought up amongst the <hi>Picts,</hi> in hopes of the Kingdom. To avoid this Danger, he sent for those Nobles, whom he most sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, to come to him, pretending he had need of their Advice, in the Publick Affairs of the Kingdom. When <note n="d" place="margin">

But, that which he hoped would be a Remedy to his Fears, was, but as a Firebrand to raise up another Conspiracy. For the Friends of those who were slain, being afraid of themselves, as well as grieving for the loss of their Relations and Kindred, unanimously take up Arms against him. Whilst he was raising an Army to oppose them, he was slain by one of his own Domesticks, about the Twelfth Year of his Reign. Some of our Country-men do add a Tale in the Case, which is more handsom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Contrived, than likely to be True. That the very Man, who slew the King, had been before sent by him to Southsayers, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire concerning the King, his Victories, his Life, and Kingdom; And that an old Wizard should answer him, <hi>That the King should not live long, but his Danger would arise, not from his Enemies, but from his Domesticks</hi>; And when he pressed the Woman, <hi>From which of them?</hi> She replyed, <hi>Even, from thy Self, Man.</hi> Whereupon, he cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the Woman; yet returning home in a great Quandary, he

thought with himself, That the Womans Answer could not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed; and yet it was not safe for him to declare it, lest he should render himself suspected to the King, who was a depraved Person and guided wholly by his own Fears. And therefore it seemed to him, the safest Course to kill the Tyrant with the Favour of many, than to preserve him alive, with the extreme hazard of his own Life.

Notwithstanding, the Islanders, not disheartned with this overthrow, after the departure of the King, sent for Forces out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and renewed the War, making <hi>Donaldus</hi> his Son, their General, in the room of his Father; under whom they again made a Descent into the Continent, and drove away much Booty.

                  <hi>Romachus,</hi> The Thirty Sixth King.</head>
               <p>AFter his Death, there was a great contest about the Kingdom, between Three Cousin-Germans, begot by the Three Brothers of <hi>Crathilinthus,</hi> their Names were <note n="r" place="margin">Dissension about Successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Crown.</note>

                     </gap>anus. Romachus</hi>'s Plea, was, that his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was the Eldest of the Three Brothers of <hi>Crathilinthus,</hi> and that his Mother was descended from the Blood-Royal of the <hi>Picts</hi>; as also, that he himself was of a stirring Disposition; and likely to procure Friends and Allys.</p>
               <p>That which made for <hi>Augusianus,</hi> was, his Age and Experience in the World, as also his admirable Deportment; to which was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Favour of the People; and that which was the principal of all, <hi>Fethelmachus,</hi> who was, before, his Competitor, now voted for him. By reason of this Sedition, the matter being like to be decided by Arms, nothing could be concluded in the First Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Estates, but That being dissolved, the whole Kingdom was divided into Two Factions; and <hi>Romachus,</hi> who was least in the favour of the People, called in the <hi>Picts</hi> Militia, for his assistance, that so he might strengthen himself by Foreign Aid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Augusianus,</hi> being informed, that Ambushes were laid for him, judged it better, once for all, to try the shock of a Battel, than to live in perpetual solicitude and fear: Whereupon, gathering his

Party into a body, he fought with <hi>Romachus,</hi> but, being overcome by Him, He and <hi>Fethelmachus</hi> fled together into the <hi>Aebudae</hi> Islands.</p>
               <p>But perceiving, he could not be safe there, because, on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his Victory, he was formidable to the Heads of the Factions, and that he was also amongst a people, naturally venal, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by the promises of <hi>Romachus,</hi> he fled into <hi>Ireland</hi> with his Friends. <note n="s" place="margin">

At length, when all were wearied with the present state of Affairs, the Nobility made a sudden combination against him; and, before he could gather his Forces together, he was taken, in his flight to the <hi>Picts,</hi> and <note n="t" place="margin">And is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore slain.</note> put to death in the Third year of his Reign.

                  <hi>Maximus,</hi> having obtained this great Victory sooner than he hoped, and scarce finding any on whom he might wreck his hatred, mercifully returned to his former Clemency; for marching over many Provinces of the <hi>Scots,</hi> he took those that yielded themselves<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> to Mercy; and caused them to till the Land, withal adding his Commands, That they should be contented with their Own, and not be offensive to their Neighbours. The <hi>Picts,</hi> taking this his Clemency in evil part, did allege, That the <hi>Romans</hi> and their Allys would never obtain a firm, solid, peace, as long as the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Scots,</hi> which were always unquiet, and took all oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities to plunder, did remain alive; adding further, That <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanny</hi> would never be secure, whilst any of the <hi>Scotish</hi> Blood remain'd
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:56771:72"/>
in it: That they were like wild Beasts, who would be sweetned by no Offices of Love, nor would they be quiet, though they received never so many Losses; so that there would be no end of War, till the whole Nation was extinct. <hi>Maximus</hi> replied many things, in bar to such severities, as, That 'twas the ancient Custom of the <hi>Romans,</hi> if they overcame any Nation, to be so far from extirpating them, that they made many of them Denizons of their City: That though they had almost Conquered the whole World, yet never any People or Nation were wholly eradicated by Them. That he himself, having slain their King, with the flower of his Army, had so quelled them, that now they were no longer to be feared, but rather pitied by their Enemies; he further urged, That his hatred of the <hi>Picts</hi> was as great as Theirs; but, if they considered the matter well, it would be a joyfuller Spectacle, to behold the Miseries of them being alive, than the Graves of them being Slain; yea, that it was a more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Punishment to live a dying Life, than, by once Dying, to put an end to all Miseries. This was the Sum of the Discourse which he made, not so much out of any Affection to the <hi>Scots,</hi> as out of Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of the <hi>Picts</hi> Cruelty. Moreover, he had an Eye to the future, as judging it extreamly hazardous to the <hi>Roman</hi> Province, if the Force of the <hi>Picts,</hi> upon the Extirpation of the <hi>Scots,</hi> should be doubled. But the <hi>Picts</hi> did so ply him with Complaints, Supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Guifts, that at length they obtained an Edict from him, That all the <note n="c" place="margin">He banisht the <hi>Scots</hi> out of all <hi>Britain,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on pain of Death, and give away their <hi>Lands.</hi>

                  <hi>Scots</hi> should depart out of <hi>Britain</hi> by a certain day, and he that was found there after the time limited, should be put to Death. Their Country was divided betwixt the <hi>Picts</hi> and <hi>Britains.</hi> Thus the surviving <hi>Scots,</hi> as every Mans Fortune led him, were scattered over <hi>Ireland,</hi> the <hi>Aebudae</hi> Islands, through <hi>Scandia,</hi> and the <hi>Cimbrick Chersonesus,</hi> and were in all places kindly received by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants. But the <hi>Picts,</hi> though they made publick Profession of the <hi>Christian</hi> Religion; yet, did not forbear to commit Injuries against Priests and Monks; which, in that Age, were had in great esteem. So that those poor Ecclesiasticks were dispersed into all the Countries round about, and many of them came into <hi>Icolumbkill,</hi> one of the <hi>Aebudae</hi> Isles, where, being gathered together in a Monastery, they transmitted an high Opinion of their Piety, and Holiness, to Posterity. The rest of the <hi>Scots</hi> being thus afflicted by Wars, exiled from their Countries, and in despair of returning thither again; The Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the <hi>Hebrides,</hi> being of a fierce and unquiet Nature, idle, poor, abounding in Men, yet wanting Necessaries, thought, That they ought to attempt something of themselves, and so gathering a Navy of <hi>Birlins,</hi> and small Ships together, under <note n="a" place="margin">The E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Their Navy was taken, and reserved for Service against the <hi>Islanders.</hi> And not long after, they which fled to <hi>Ireland,</hi> partly out of Remembrance of their Ancient Alliance, and partly out of Commiseration of their Fortune, did easily incite a
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:56771:73"/>
Nation, naturally inclined to War and Plunder, to afford them Aid to recover their Country and Antient Patrimony. Ten Thousand Auxiliaries were allowed them, who, landing in that part of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which is opposite to <hi>Ireland,</hi> struck a great terrour to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple over all the Country. Being encouraged by their first happy Success, when they were consulting how to carry on the War, the <hi>Albian Scots,</hi> well knowing the strength of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and how much they exceeded other Nations, in their skill about Military Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, persuaded them to be contented with their present Victory, and to return home with their Booty, not staying till the whole force of <hi>Britain</hi> was gathered together, to assault them. And seeing, that the Forces of all <hi>Ireland,</hi> if they had been there, could not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the <hi>Roman</hi> Army, which, by its Conduct and Valour, had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most subdued the whole World; therefore, they were to deal with them, not by open Force, but by Subtilty. That they were to watch opportunities, and seeing they could not match their Enemies in Number, Force, or Warlike Skill, that therefore they should weary them out with Toil and Labour. And that This was the only Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod for the managing the War with them. The <hi>Irish-Scots</hi> on the other side, did blame those of <hi>Albium,</hi> whose former Valour was now so Languid, That though they were the Off-Spring of those, who had almost overthrown whole Armies of the <hi>Romans,</hi> yet, that they could not <hi>now</hi> look them in the Face; Yea, there were some of the <hi>Albine-Scots</hi> themselves of the same Opinion, alleging, That this Method of War, propounded by their Country-Men, was very vain and frivolous, serving only to vex the Enemy, but not to recover their own Country; and that therefore they ought to follow their good Fortune, and not to think of returning, till she made way for them. And, if they would act thus, then, no doubt, but God (who had blessed them with such prosperous beginnings) would, by their Arms, lessen the power of the Enemie, either by raising up new Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults amongst the <hi>Britains,</hi> or, by calling off the <hi>Roman</hi> Legions to a War nearer home. That the Occasion, now offered, was not to be neglected, lest hereafter it might be sought for in Vain: This O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion prevailed, and so they joyfully returned to their Prey. Thus, whilst in hopes, to recover what they had lost, they indulged their own Will, rather rashly than prudently, being immediately over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powred by greater Forces, they lost the best part of their Men. This Slaughter being made known in <hi>Ireland,</hi> cut off all hopes of return from the <hi>Scots,</hi> and made the <hi>Irish</hi> fear, lest they also should not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their Liberty, long; so that, after many Consultations, they could find no way more adviseable, than, that the <hi>Irish Scots</hi> should send Ambassadors into <hi>Britain,</hi> to make <note n="b" place="margin">And forced to make Peace with the <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

their Government, with a friendly Respect to the <hi>Romans.</hi> The <hi>Hibernians,</hi> having thus obtained better Terms than they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, returned joyfully home. That which inclined <hi>Maximus</hi> to make this easie Pacification, was, not his fear of the <hi>Hibernians,</hi> (for he did not much value all the disturbance, they could give him) but because, his Mind, being intent upon hopes of greater matters, he was willing to leave all <hi>Britain,</hi> not only quiet and free from War, but also affectionate and under an obligation to him. For, when he perceived, after the Defeat and Slaughter of so many of their Armies, that the Forces of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire were shattered and weakned by their Civil Wars; and that the Emperors were not made by the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and People, but by Military Election and Favour; considering also, That he had conquered <hi>Britain,</hi> (which none ever did, before him) and thereby had got great Fame by his Military Exploits, and had an Army (for the number of it) strong enough; in this posture of Affairs, he determined, if Fortune offred him an Opportunity to seize on the Empire, not to be wanting thereunto. Being promp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by this hope, he treated his Souldiers with great Affability, and bestowed on them many Largesses; he took advice in all his impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Affairs, of the Noblest of the <hi>Britains,</hi> he recruited his Army with <hi>Picts</hi> Soldiers, and committed several Garisons, in divers places, to be kept by them. The Lands of the <hi>Scots</hi> he divided betwixt Them, and the <hi>Britains.</hi> To the <hi>Picts</hi> he left their ancient Possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, free; only he exacted a small Tribute from the utmost Angle of the <hi>Scotish</hi> Kingdom, which he had given to them as a Testimony, (for so he gave it out himself,) that all <hi>Britain</hi> was partly overcome, and partly setled on Conditions of Peace, by him. And by these Artifices, he strangely won the Affections of the common Soldiers: So that all things being in readiness, according to his conceived hope, he assumed the <hi>Diadem,</hi> as if he had been compelled so to do, by his Soldiers. After him, <hi>Constantine</hi> was chosen General by the <hi>Britains,</hi> being recommended only upon the accompt of his Name, for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, he was but a common Soldier at first; he being also slain, <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> a Person descended of <hi>British</hi> Blood, ruled over the Island.

Whereupon, That they might have One, to whom to resort in order to a publick Consultation, for the remedying of these Calamities, they create <hi>Durstus,</hi> the Son of <hi>Hergustus,</hi> King. The Nobles being Assembled about him, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide Remedy for their Miseries; their Complaints did express the Severity of their Bondage. They alleged, That they were now not in an imaginary, but real, Slavery: That they were shut up within the Walls of <hi>Severus,</hi> as wild Beasts, severed from all human Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce; and that all their Soldiery, under the splendid Name of War, were indeed drawn out for the Shambles. That, besides the hatred of their Neighbour Nations, they were bitterly reproached by the <hi>Monks</hi> too, who cryed out, That God did justly despise and reject their Prayers, who had so cruelly persecuted his Ministers, though they were their Brethren, and of the same Religion with themselves, in that they would not suffer them, by whom God might been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peased or exorated, to live in the same Country with them: These Things did grievously pinch their Consciences; so that, Adversity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing some sparks of Religion into their Minds, and also some ease from their Miseries being obtained, they, at last, pitched upon This, as the only Way to recover their Liberty. That after they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled themselves to the <hi>Scots,</hi> they would also endeavour to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pease the Wrath of God, who was an Enemy to them for their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidiousness.

Some of the Forces fell upon <hi>Hungary,</hi> some upon <hi>Gallia</hi>; and <hi>Fergusius,</hi> both out of his love to Arms, and his hatred to the <hi>Romans,</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Francs,</hi> in their War against the <hi>Gauls:</hi> But that Expedition proved not very prosperous, so that he returned into <hi>Scandia</hi> with greater Glory, than Success: And when his Name began to be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, not only <hi>there,</hi> but also amongst the Neighbor-Nations, his Fame also reaching to the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts,</hi> both gave the former hope to recover their own Country again, and also the later to obtain their ancient Liberty; if, laying aside their old Grudges, they should chuse him General, and try their Fortune against the <hi>Romans.</hi> And indeed, at that time, the Affairs of the <hi>Romans</hi> were brought to so low an Ebb, by reason of the Successes of the Neighboring-Nations against them, that the Opportunity it self was Bait enough to excite old Enemies, to revenge the former Injuries, they had received from them. For, their Emperors, besides their being weakned by Civil Wars, were so vexed on every side by the <hi>Gauls, Vandals, Franks</hi> and <hi>Africans,</hi> who did severally make In-rodes upon them, each from his own Coast, that, omitting the care of Foreign Affairs, they called back their Armies into <hi>Italy,</hi> to defend <hi>Rome</hi> it self, the Seat of their Empire. In the midst of these Commotions, they, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the <hi>British</hi> Legions, esteeming the <hi>Roman</hi> Affairs as despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, did each study their own Advantages, and severally to establish their distinct Tyrannies. Neither were they content to vex the Islan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders with all kind of Cruelty and Avarice, but they also harassed one another by Mutual Incursions. So, the Number of the Legionary Soldiers did daily decrease, and the hatred of the Provincials against them did increase. So that, all <hi>Britanny</hi> would have rebelled against them, if they had had Forces, answerable to their Desires: But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all their Miseries, That was most prejudicial to the <hi>Britains,</hi> which the Emperor <hi>Constantine,</hi> the last General of the <hi>Roman</hi> Army,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:56771:75"/>
caused them to endure; For, when he was made Emperor, he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew, not only the <hi>Roman</hi> Army, but even the <hi>British</hi> Soldiers too; and so left the whole Island disarmed, and exposed to all Violence, if they had had any Foreign Enemy to invade them. This was the chief occasion, which did mightily hasten the combination of the <hi>Scots.</hi> When Affairs stood in this posture, secret Messengers were sent betwixt the <note n="h" place="margin">The <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts</hi> unite against the <hi>Romans,</hi> then brought low by their own Civil Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensions.</note> 
               <hi>Scots</hi> and the <hi>Picts</hi>; and a Peace struck up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them. Whereupon, they Both sent Ambassadors to call home <hi>Fergusius,</hi> to undertake the Kingly Government, as, descending to him from his Ancestors. <hi>Fergusius,</hi> being a Military Man, desirous of Honour, and, besides, not so well pleased with his present Estate, but encouraged with hopes of a better, easily accepted the Terms. When his return was noised abroad, many of the Exiled <hi>Scots,</hi> yea, several of the <hi>Danes</hi> also, his acquaintance, and fellow-Soldiers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing encouraged by the same hopes, accompanied him also home: They all landed in <hi>Argyle.</hi> Thither all those Exiles, which were in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the Circumjacent Islands, having notice given them before of his coming, resorted speedily to him; and they also drew along with them, a considerable number of their <hi>Clans</hi> and Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and also several young Soldiers, who were desirous of Innovation.</p>

The Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Kings, though they were Superior to their Enemies, in swift Marchings, and enduring of Hardships; yet, being inferiour in Number and Force, resolved not to Fight pitched Battels any more, but rather to weary their Enemies, by frequent Inrodes, and not to put all at a venture in one Fight, seeing they were not, as yet, of Force sufficient so to do. But when they heard, That the <hi>Romans</hi> were returned out of <hi>Britain,</hi> they altered their Resolutions, and gathering all their Forces together, they demolished the Wall of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verus,</hi> which was slightly repaired, only by the Hands of Souldiers, and but negligently guarded neither, by the <hi>Brittons.</hi> So that by this means, having a larger Scope to Forage in, they made the Country beyond the Wall, (which they were not able to keep, for want of Men) useless to the <hi>Brittons,</hi> for many Miles: It is reported, that one <hi>Graham</hi> was the principal Man in demolishing that Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; who, transporting his Soldiers in Ships, landed beyond the <hi>Wall,</hi> and slew the Guards unawares, and unprovided; and so made a passage for his Men. 'Tis not certain amongst Writers, Whether this <hi>Graham</hi> were a <hi>Scot,</hi> or a <hi>Britton</hi>; but most think, That he was a <hi>Britton,</hi> descended of the <hi>Fulgentian</hi> Sept, a Prime and Noble Family in that Nation; as also, That he was the Father in Law of King <hi>Fergusius:</hi> I am most inclined to be of this last Opinion. The Wall then being thus Razed, the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts</hi> did Rage, with most inhuman Cruelties, over the <hi>Brittons,</hi> without distinction of Age or

Sex: For (as Matters then stood) the <hi>Brittons</hi> were weak and unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed to War, so that they sent a lamentable Embassy to <hi>Rome,</hi> complaining of the unspeakable Calamities they endured, and with great humility and earnestness, supplicating for Aid, farther alleging, That if they were not moved at the Destruction of the <hi>Brittons,</hi> and the loss of a Province, (lately, so splendid an one,) yet, it became the <hi>Romans</hi> to maintain their own Dignity, lest their Names should grow con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible amongst those Barbarous Nations.

                  <hi>Dionethus,</hi> a <hi>Britton,</hi> they drew forth towards the Enemy. This <hi>Dionethus</hi> was well descended in his own Country, but always an Adviser of his Countrymen to shake off the <hi>Roman</hi> Yoke; and then especially, when so fair an Opportunity was offered, and the whole Strength of the Empire was engaged in other Wars, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he was suspected by his own Men as an Affector of Novelty, and was hated of the <hi>Romans,</hi> but was a Friend to the <hi>Scots,</hi> and <hi>Picts</hi>; who, understanding, That the Design of the <hi>Romans,</hi> was, first to destroy <hi>Dionethus,</hi> as an Enemy near at hand, and in their very Bowels, to obviate their purpose, made great Marches towards them; and joyning their Forces with Those of <hi>Dionethus</hi>'s, began a a sharp Encounter with the <hi>Romans,</hi> who, over-powered by Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, both in Front and Reer, were put to Flight. When the Ranks of the Legionary Soldiers were thus broken, and gave Ground, the Confederate King being too eager in pursuit, fell amongst the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and the rest of their Army, who stood in good Order, and were repulsed by them with <note n="*" place="margin">

                  <hi>Maximianus</hi> (so our Writers call him, who commanded the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Legion) being dismayed at this Check, retired into the midst of his Province; And the Opposite Kings returned each to his own Dominion.

The <hi>Roman</hi> General placed the <hi>Brittons</hi> in the Front, and the <hi>Romans</hi> in the Reserves: The Fight was fierce, and the Front gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

There fell in that Fight <hi>Fergus</hi> King of the <hi>Scots,</hi> and <hi>Durstus</hi> King of the <hi>Picts, Dionethus,</hi> being wounded, was, with great difficulty, carried off to the Sea, and in a Skiff returned home. This Victory struck such a Terrour to all, that it recalled the memory of Ancient Times, in so much that many consulted, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to betake themselves for their Place of Exile. <hi>Fergusius</hi> died, when he had Reigned Sixteen Years, a Man of an Heroick Spirit, and who may deservedly be called, The Second Founder of the <hi>Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish</hi> Kingdom; yea, (perhaps) he may be said to exceed the former <note n="*" place="margin">The Two <hi>Fergus</hi>'s com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared.</note>

But this later <hi>Fergusius,</hi> when almost all were slain, who were able to bear Arms, being also brought up in a Foreign Country; and after the 27th Year of his Banishment from his Own, being sent for as an unknown King, by those Subjects who were as unknown to him, marched with a mixed Army, packed up of several Nations, against the <hi>Brittons,</hi> who were sometimes also assisted by the Forces of the <hi>Romans;</hi> so that, if God had not mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly favoured his Designs, he might seem to have undertaken a very Temerarious Attempt, and bordering upon Madness it self. When he was slain, he left three Sons behind him, very young, <hi>Eugenius, Dongardus,</hi> and <hi>Constantius; Graham,</hi> their Uncle by the Mother's side, was by Universal Consent, appointed <hi>Guardian</hi> over them, and in the mean time, till they came to be of Age, he was to manage the Government, as Regent.

                  <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts</hi> understood for certain, by their Spies, that the <hi>Romans</hi> were departed, and would return no more; they assaulted the Wall, with all their might, and much more eagerly than before, and did not only cast down their Opposers, by hurling Darts at them, but also drew them off the Wall with Cramp-Irons, as <hi>Bede</hi> calls them; which were, as I understand, Crooked Iron Instruments, of Hooks, fastened on the tops of long Poles; so that the upper Fortification being thus made destitute of its Defenders, they applied their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines, and overthrew the Foundation also; and thus an entrance and passage being made, they enforced their affrightned Enemies to leave their Habitations and Dwellings, and to fly away for safety, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they could find it. For the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts</hi> were so eagerly bent on Revenge, that all their former Calamities seemed tolerable to their Enemies, in respect of Those they were now forced to endure. Afterwards, the Assailants, rather wearied than satisfied with the Miseries of their Enemies, returned home, and began, at last, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>think themselves, That they had not so much taken away the Goods of their Enemies, as withal, they had despoiled themselves of the Rewards of their Victory. And therefore convening an Assembly of the Estates; it was disputed amongst them, How so great a Victory might be improved; and their first Result was, to replenish those Lands, which they had taken from the Enemy, with new Colonies, for the Procreation of a new Progeny. This Counsel seemed the more wholesome and adviseable, because of the abundance of Vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, but Indigent, Officers and Soldiers, who had not room enough to live in their ancient Habitations. This turn of Prosperity, being signified to the Neighbouring Nations, encouraged not only the <hi>Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish</hi> Exiles, but a great company of Strangers too, who lived but poorly at home, to flock in, as to a Prey; for they supposed, that a Man of that Spirit and Conduct, as <hi>Graham</hi> was, would never lay down Arms, till he had brought the whole Island of <hi>Britain</hi> under his Subjection; but herein they were mistaken; for he, having run so many hazards, was more inclineable to Peace, with Honour and Glory, than to hazard his present certain Felicity, by casting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self into an uncertain Danger. And therefore he made <note n="b" place="margin">A Peace made betwixt the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts</hi> of the one part, and the <hi>Brittons</hi> on the other.</note> Peace with the <hi>Brittons,</hi> who were not only willing to, but also very earnestly desirous of, the same. The Terms were, That each People should be contented with their own Bounds, and abstain from Wrong and Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, towards one another; the Mound to both was <hi>Adrian</hi>'s Wall.

For when their Cities were razed, their Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages burnt, their Cattel driven away, and all their Instruments of Husbandry lost; they, who survived this Cruelty of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, were enforced to maintain their needy Lives by Hunting, or else to turn their course of Plunder from their Enemies, upon their own Countrymen: So that an Intestine War was almost like to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue, upon an External Peace. Neither were they only the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Enemies of Foreiners; For, thÃ´ they abstained from open Wars, yet ever and anon they spoiled the Countries, contiguous to them: Also, a Party of the <hi>Hibernians,</hi> being encouraged by hope of Booty, did vex the poor People, who were already miserably enough distressed, with their Marine Invasions.

free themselves from the bondage of the <hi>Romans.</hi> For which Cause, he was banished by the contrary Faction, who were then more powerful, and so he fled to the <hi>Scots,</hi> his old Allies, between whom many Civilities had formerly passed. After his Death, <hi>Eugenius,</hi> by his Ambassadors, demanded a Restitution of those fruitful Lands, which were his Ancestors, situate within the Wall of <hi>Adrian</hi>; inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating plainly to them, That unless they did restore them, he would make War upon them, When the Ambassadors had decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their Message in an Assembly of the <hi>Brittons,</hi> there were such Heats amongst them, that they came almost to blows. They that were the fiercest of them, cryed out, That the <hi>Scots</hi> did not seek for Lands so much, (of which they had enough) as for War; and That they did not only insult over their new Calamities, but also were resolved to try their Patience; if the Lands were denied, then a War would presently follow; if they were restored, then a cruel Enemy was to be received into their own Bowels; and yet, they should not have Peace even <hi>Then,</hi> unless they imagined, That their Covetousness would be satisfied with the Concession of a few Lands, who were not contented with large Provinces, which were parted with in the last War.

This Counsel (he gave, as he alleged) not out of any Respect to his private Interest, but merely for the necessities of the Publick, which appears, (said he) by this, That as long as there was any probability to defend ourselves against the Cruelty of our Enemies, he never made any mention of Peace at all; he added, That he was not ignorant, that this Peace, which he now persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to, would not be a lasting one, but only prove a small Respite from War, till the force of the <hi>Brittons,</hi> weakned by so many los<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and almost ruined, might be refreshed, and gather strength by a little intermission; Whilst he was thus speaking, a Noise arose in the whole Assembly, which made him afraid: For the Seditious cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> That he did not respect the publick Good, but only ende<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

His Loss caused the wiser sort to refrain giving their Votes freely, thÃ´ they evidently saw, that the Destruction of their Country was at hand. The Ambassadors, returning home without their Errand, The <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts</hi> left off all other Business, and prepared wholly for War; The <hi>Brittons</hi> foreseeing the same, after their fit of Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was somewhat over, send Ambassadors to <hi>Scotland,</hi> who, upon pretence of making Peace, were to put some stop to the War, and to offer them Money; giving the <hi>Scots</hi> hopes, That they might get more from them, by way of an amicable Treaty, than they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to seek for by War; That the Chances of War were doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and the issue uncertain; That it was not the part of Wise Men, to neglect the benefit which was in their view, and, upon uncertain hopes, to cast themselves upon most certain and assured Dangers. Nothing was obtained by this Ambassy, for <hi>Eugenius</hi> was informed by his Spies, That the <hi>Brittons</hi> did but dissemble the obtaining of a Peace abroad, whilst they were intent upon high Warlike Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations at home; so that, for that reason, the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts</hi> being inflamed with their old hatred, and invited by the Calamities of the <hi>Brittons</hi>; or else, lifted up with Success, would give them no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, but to yield up All; so that, both Armies prepared for the last Encounter. The Confederate Kings, having been Conquerors for some years, were now erected to the hope of a greater Victory; and the <hi>Brittons,</hi> on the other side, set before their Eyes all the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series, that a fierce and conquering Enemy could inflict upon them: In this posture of Affairs, and temper of Spirit, when both Parties came in sight of one another, such a <note n="g" place="margin">A terrible Fight between the <hi>Scots</hi> and the <hi>Picts</hi>; and the <hi>Brittons.</hi>
                  </note> sharp Fight commenced be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, as the Inhabitants of <hi>Britanny</hi> had never seen before, it was so obstinately maintained, that, after very long, and hot, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, the Right Wing of the <hi>Scots,</hi> was, thÃ´ with difficulty, enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to give ground; which <hi>Eugenius</hi> perceiving, having before brought all his other Reserves into Service, he drew on also the Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons, left to guard the Baggage, into the Fight; They, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, routed the <hi>Brittons,</hi> which stood against them, so that the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory began on that side, whence the fear of a Total overthrow did proceed. The rest of the <hi>Brittons,</hi> following the Fortune of the other Brigade, ran away too, and flying into the Woods and Marishes near to the place where the Battel was fought, as they were thus straggling, dispersed, and unarmed, their Enemies Baggage-men, and Attendants, slew abundance of them.

He, perceiving that the Forces of the <hi>Brittons</hi> were broken, both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad by Wars, and at home by Fewds, Robberies, and Discords, thought fit to attempt nothing by Arms; but, during the Ten years he reigned, he maintained Peace with his Neighbours; at last, he was Slain by the Treachery of <hi>Vortigern,</hi> a Potent and Ambitious man; He left Three Sons behind him, of which Two were under Age; the Third and Eldest, as unfit for Government, was thrust into a Monastery; yet he was made King, principally by the Assistance of <hi>Vortigern,</hi> who sought to obtain Wealth and Power to himself, under the Envy of another mans Name. The Fields, which were now tilled in time of Peace, after a most grievous Famine, yielded such a plentiful Crop of Grain, that the like was never heard of in <hi>Britain,</hi> before. And from hence those Vices did arise, which u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually accompany Peace, as <note n="*" place="margin">Luxury, the usual Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Peace.</note> Luxury, Cruelty, Whoredom, Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenness, which are more pernicious than all the Mischiefs of War. There was no Truth or Sincerity to be found, and that not only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Vulgar, but even the Monks, and the Professors of an Holier Life, made a mock at Equity, Faithfulness, and constant Piety of Life; of which <hi>Bede,</hi> the <hi>Anglo-Saxon</hi>; and <hi>Gildas,</hi> the <hi>Britton,</hi> do make an heavy Complaint. In the mean time, the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, who returned from <hi>Aetius,</hi> brought word, That no relief could be expected from him, for the <hi>Brittons</hi> had sent Letters to <hi>Aetius,</hi> some Clauses whereof, as they are mentioned by <hi>Bede,</hi> I shall here recite; both because they are a succinct History of the Miseries of that Nation; and also, because they demonstrate, How much many Writers are mistaken, in their Memoirs. The Words are these, <hi>To</hi> Aetius, <hi>the third time Consul, the Complaints of the</hi> Brittons. And a little after; <hi>The Barbarians drive us to the Sea, the Sea beats us back again upon the Barbarians; between These two kinds of Deaths, we are either Killed or Drowned.</hi> Now <hi>Aetius</hi> was joyned, in his Third Consulship, with <hi>Symmachus,</hi> in the 450<hi rend="sup">th</hi> year after <hi>Christ.</hi> Neither could there any Aid be obtained from him, who was then principally intent upon the observing the Motions of <hi>Attila</hi>: The rest of the <hi>Brittons</hi> being driven to this desperate point, only <note n="l" place="margin">

                  <hi>Vortigern</hi> was glad of the publick Calamity; and, in such a general hurly-burly, he thought, he might, with greater Impunity, perpetrate that Wickedness, which he had long before designed in his mind; which was, to cause the King to be Slain, by those Guards, which
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:56771:80"/>
he had appointed about him, and afterwards, to avert the suspition of so foul a Parricide from himself, in a pretended Fit of Anger, as if he were impatient of delay in Executing Revenge, he caused the Guards also to be put to death, without suffering them to plead for themselves. Thus having obtained the Kingdom by the highest degree of Villany, he managed it with as little Sanctity. For, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specting the Faithfulness of the People towards him, and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiding in his own strength, which was but small, he engaged the <hi>Saxons</hi> to take his part, who then exercised Pyracy at Sea, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested all the shores far and near.

However he came by his end, this is certain, he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned the <hi>Scots</hi> with such Equity, that he may deservedly be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned amongst the Best of their Kings. For, tho' he spent the first Part of his Life, almost from his Childhood, in War, yet he so profited under the Discipline of his Grandfather, and his Mind was so esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished thereby, that neither Military Freedom (as it usually doth) did draw him to Vice; neither did it make him more negligent in conforming his Manners to the Rule of Piety; nor did his prosperous Success make him more arrogant. And on the other side, the Peace and Calm, he enjoyed, did not abate the sharpness of his Understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, nor break his Martial Spirit; but he managed his Life, with such an equal and poised Temper, that, by the advantage of his natural Disposition, he did equal, or rather exceed, those Princes, who are instructed in the Liberal Arts, and from thence come to the Helm of Government.</p>

The <hi>Scotch</hi> Nobility, being offended at these Miscarriages, came often to him, to put him in mind of his Duty. He received their Admonitions very haughtily, bidding them to look after their own Affairs, saying, That he had better Advice from others: He also told them, That they were much mistaken, if they thought to Limit their King, on pretence of Advising him. And as he was thus arrogant towards his Subjects; so he was as abject and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missive to his Enemies. For he granted them Peace at first asking, and forgave them the Injuries they had committed; withal, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molished some Castles, and deliver'd up others to them. This Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of his did so far incense the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts,</hi> that the <hi>Scots</hi> were ready to Rebel; and the <hi>Picts,</hi> who before had secretly dealt with the <hi>Saxons,</hi> set up for themselves, and at last made a publick League with them.

But yet, if
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:56771:81"/>
War should come, as an accession to their other Miseries, the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom would be endangered, yea, hardly retrievable from Destruction; especially, seeing the <hi>Picts</hi> were alienated from them; the <hi>Brittons,</hi> since <hi>Vortimers</hi> Death, but their uncertain Friends; and the <hi>Saxons</hi> (who were very strong and potent, and who managed there Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries with great Cruelties, and in whose Commerce their was no Faithfulness) were always intent upon the Destruction of all their Neighbours.</p>
               <p>Thus by the Prudence of the Ancienter, the Tumult of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People was appeased, but the King continuing to reign, tho' with the Hatred and Contempt of all, was at length slain <note n="q" place="margin">And violent Death.</note> by a Nobleman of the <hi>Aebudae,</hi> for vitiating his Daughter by force, in the Fifteenth year of his Reign.

In his Reign, <hi>Aurelius Ambrosius</hi> came into This <hi>Britain,</hi> out of the Lesser beyond Sea; he was the Son of <hi>Constantine,</hi> who held the Kingdom some years before; but, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Treacherously Slain, and his Brother, who reigned after his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, being also slain by <hi>Vortigern,</hi> by like Treachery, the Two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther remaining Sons of <hi>Constantine</hi> were conveyed by their Fathers Friends into <hi>Gallick Bretagne.</hi> I think, this Original of <hi>Aurelius Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brosius</hi> is truer, than That which others deliver, (among whom is <hi>Bede</hi>) for they say, that he was the last of the <hi>Roman</hi> stock, who reigned in <hi>Britanny</hi>: These two Brothers, when <hi>Vortimer</hi> was slain by the fraud of his Stepmother; and <hi>Vortigern</hi> had made himself King without Authority or Power, being now grown up and fit to Govern, returned, with the great Favour and Expectation of all men, into the Island, to recover their Fathers Kingdom; and withal, they brought no inconsiderable number of <hi>Britains</hi> out of <hi>Gaul</hi> along with them. After their Arrival, before they would alarm the strangers, they subdued <hi>Vortigern</hi> in <hi>Wales,</hi> and then sent Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts,</hi> desiring their Allyance and craving their Conjunction in Arms against the <hi>Saxons,</hi> the most bitter Enemies of the <hi>Christian</hi> Name. Their Embassy was kindly received by the <hi>Scots</hi>; and the League, before made with <hi>Constantine,</hi> was again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed, which from that day remained almost inviolate, till the Kingdom of <hi>Britanny</hi> was oppressed by the <hi>Angles</hi>; and the Kingdom of the <hi>Picts,</hi> by the <hi>Scots.</hi> But the <hi>Picts</hi> answered the <hi>British</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors, That they had already made a League with the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and that they saw no Cause to break it, but they were resolved to run all hazards with them, for the future, as partakers of their good or bad success. Thus the whole Island was divided into Two Factions, the <note n="r" place="margin">

                  <hi>COngallus</hi> succeeded <hi>Constantine,</hi> the Son of <hi>Dongardus, Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine's</hi> Brother; He was inclineable to Arms; but durst not then attempt any thing, in regard the People were effeminated and weakned by Sloth and Luxury, during the Reign of his Uncle. And, tho' Many, in compliance with his Disposition, (as usually Kings have many such Parasites) did often persuade him to take Arms; yet, he would never be induced thereunto. First then, he applied himself to correct the publick Manners, neither did he attempt to reduce the Ancient Discipline, till he had Created new Magistrates, and, by their means, had abridged Suits and Controversies, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained Thefts and Robberies. Peace being setled at home, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to reclaim others to a civiller course of Life, first of all by his own Example; and, if any took no Copy from him, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted obstinately in their Evil Courses, Such he either gently chasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed and punished, or else sleighted them as despicable and worthless Persons, and thus he quickly reduced all things to their former state: Seeing (as I said before) at the beginning of his Reign, he gave up himself wholly to the study of Peace, the <hi>Brittons</hi> began to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade <note n="*" place="margin">

Congallus</hi> had War with the <hi>Saxons</hi> all the time of his Reign; but it was a slow and intermittent one, as Parties fortuitously met in driving of their respective Preys; in which kind of Fighting, the <hi>Scots</hi> being nimble, light, and most Horsemen, accounted themselves Superior to their Enemies; but they never came to a pitch'd Battel. For <hi>Congallus</hi> was of opinion, That it was best to commit as few things, as we could, to the Arbitrement of Fortune, and therefore he sent Part of his Forces to help <hi>Aurelius Ambrosius</hi>; and with the rest, he wearied his Enemy, and never suffered him to rest Night nor Day. <note n="s" place="margin">

He was the chief Means and Occasion, that the <hi>Picts,</hi> deserting the <hi>Saxons,</hi> made a joint League with the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Britains.</hi> At that time, <hi>Lothus</hi> was King of the <hi>Picts,</hi> a Person, who excelled the Princes of his time, in all accomplishments, both of Body and Mind. <note n="a" place="margin">

That it ought to be esteemed the most grievous thing of all, by one, who was a true Christian, to consent to that League, whereby Christian Religion must be extinguished; profane Rites renewed; and wicked Tyrants, Enemies of Piety and Humanity, armed with Power against God and his Law.</p>

                  <hi>Vter</hi> might have been accounted one of the greatest Kings of his Age, unless, by one foul and impious Fact, he had blurred all his other great Virtues: There was one <hi>Gorlois,</hi> a <hi>Noble Britton,</hi> of great Valour and Power, when <hi>Vter</hi> as yet was but a private Man, he fell mightily in Love with his Wife, named <hi>Igerne,</hi> a very beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Woman; but her Chastity being a long time a Guard against his Lust, at last her Continency was conquered by <hi>Merlin,</hi> an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daciously wicked Man; and, in this Adulterous course, he begat a Son on her, Named <hi>Arthur.

as he grew up, appeared so amiable, in the Lineaments of his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and in the Inclinations of his Mind, that the Eyes of his Parents, and of all his Subjects too, were fixed upon him, and he gave many <hi>Omens</hi> of his future Greatness, that, after his Fathers Death, all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed him to be their King. And his Father was so much pleased with this Humour of the People, that he cherished it by all the Ars he could; so that now it was the common Opinion, That none but <hi>Arthur</hi> should be Heir to the <hi>Crown. Vter</hi> died, when he had Reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed 17 Years, and presently <hi>Arthur</hi> was set up in his stead; though <hi>Lothus,</hi> King of the <hi>Picts,</hi> did much oppose it, grievously complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that his Children (for he had Two, begotten on <hi>Anna, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thur</hi>'s Aunt, who were now of years) were deprived of their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and that a Bastard, begotten in Adultery, was preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them. On the other side, all the <hi>Brittons</hi> stood for <hi>Arthur,</hi> and denied, that he was to be counted Spurious, because <hi>Vter</hi> Married his Mother at last; though it were after his Birth; and by that Marriage had treated him as his Legitimate Son, and had always accounted him, so to be: But although they pretended this colour of Right, yet that, which stood <hi>Arthur</hi> in most stead, was, his great Ingenuity, and those Specimens of his Virtue, which he often shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; yea, there was a tacite Impression (as it were) on the Minds of all Men, presaging his future Greatness. So that all ran in thick and threefold (as we say) to his Party, in so much that <hi>Lothus,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing born down not only by that Pretence of Right, (which, after that time, was always observed in <hi>Britanny</hi>) but by the Affections of the People running another way, desisted from his Enterprize in demanding the Kingdom; which he did so much the rather do, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was loth to trust his Children, for whom That Kingdom was desired, to the <hi>Brittons,</hi> who had shewed themselves so averse to Them. Besides, the Intreaties of his Friends did prevail with him, who all alledged, That no Kingdom ought to be so dear to him, as that, for the sake thereof, he should joyn in Affinity with Infidels, (to the overthrow of the <hi>Christian</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Religion) who would no more Inviolably keep their League and Alliance with him, than they had done before with the <hi>Brittons.</hi> Moreover, the Liberal and Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Disposition of <hi>Arthur,</hi> and the Greatness of his Mind, even above his Age, did much affect him. Insomuch that the League made by former Kings, betwixt the <hi>Scots, Picts,</hi> and <hi>Brittons,</hi> was again renewed, and thereupon so great a Familiarity ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that <hi>Lothus</hi> promised to send <hi>Galvinus,</hi> the youngest of his Two Sons, unto the <hi>British</hi> Court, as soon as he was old enough to endure Travel. <hi>Arthur</hi> entred upon the Regal Government before he was full Eighteen Years of Age. But as his Courage was above his Age, so Success was not wanting to his Daring Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; for, whereas his Father had divided the Kingdom by certain Boundaries, with the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and had made Peace with them on Conditions: The fair Opportunity offered them, by reason of the youthful Age of the King, more prevailed with them, to break the Peace, than the Sanctity of the League, to observe it. <hi>Arthur,</hi> that he might quench the Fire in the beginning, gathered an Army toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sooner than any Man could imagine, and, being assisted with

Auxiliaries from the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts,</hi> he overthrew the Enemy in Two great Battels, compelling them to pay Tribute, and to receive Laws from him. With the same eagerness and speed, he took <note n="c" place="margin">

But the next Summer after, as soon as ever he came before <hi>York,</hi> he had it immediately surrendred to him; his unexpected Success, the Year before, had struck such a Terrour into the Minds of Men. He took up his Winter-Quarters there, whither there resorted to him the prime Persons of the Neighbourhood, and of his Subjects, where they spent the later end of <hi>December,</hi> in Mirth, Jollity, Drinking, and the Vices which proceed therefrom; so that the Representations of the old Heathenish Feasts, dedicated to <hi>Saturn,</hi> were here again revived; but the Number of the Days they lasted were doubled; and amongst the Wealthier sort, trebled; during which time, they count it almost a Sin to treat of any serious Matter.

               <p>In the mean time, the <hi>Saxons</hi> were reported to have pitched their Tents by the River <hi>Humber</hi>; and, Whether it were so or no, <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thur</hi> marched towards them. But in regard the <hi>Brittons</hi> were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feebled by Pleasures, by that means they were less fit for Military Services; in so much that they did not seem the same Men, who had overthrown the <hi>Saxons</hi> in so many Battels heretofore; for, by their Luxurious Idleness, they had added so much to their Rashness, as they had lost of their ancient Severity of Discipline. Hereupon Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice was given by the wiser sort, to send for Aid from the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts.</hi> Whereupon Ambassadors were sent, and Aid easily obtained; so that those, whom Ambition had almost disjoined, yet the mutual Care of Religion, and Emulation too, did so piece together, That Forces were sent from either King, sooner than could well have been imagined. <hi>Lothus</hi> also, that he might give a Publick Testimony of his Reconcilement, brought his Sons <hi>Modredus</hi> and <hi>Galvinus</hi> with him into the Camp; <hi>Galvinus</hi> he gave to <hi>Arthur,</hi> as his Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whom he received with so great Courtesie; that, from that Day forward, they lived and died together. The Army of the Three Kings being thus ready, and their Camps joyned, it was unanimously agreed between them, That as the Danger was common to them all, and the Cause thereof was also <hi>the same,</hi> so they would drive out the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and restore the Christian Rites and Religion, which were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faned by them. The Armies drawing near the one to the other, <hi>Occa,</hi> Son of a former <hi>Occa,</hi> who was then General of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> made haste to joyn Battel. In the Confederate Army, the Two

                  </note> by reason of his Wounds, so terrified the rest, that the whole Wing was broken. In the other Wing, <hi>Colgernus,</hi> the <hi>Saxon,</hi> after great Complaints made of the Perfidiousness of the <hi>Picts,</hi> made an assault upon <hi>Lothus,</hi> with great Violence, who was easily known by his Habit and his Arms, he dismounted him; but he himself, being environed in the midst of his Enemies, was run through by Two <hi>Picts,</hi> with Spears on both sides of his Body. The main Battel, where there was the sharpest Fight, having lost both Wings, did at length give Ground: <hi>Occa</hi> being wounded, was carried to the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side, with as many as could get on Shipboard with him, and Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported into <hi>Germany</hi>; of the rest of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> Those, who were most obstinate in their Errour, were put to Death: The rest, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to turn to the Christian Religion, were saved.</p>
               <p>There were great Forces of the <hi>Saxons</hi> yet remaining in the Eastern part of <hi>England,</hi> and in <hi>Kent.</hi> The Summer after, <hi>Arthur</hi> marched against them, having 10000 <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts</hi> for his Assistance; <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gallus,</hi> the Son of <hi>Eugenius,</hi> commanded the <hi>Scots</hi>; and <hi>Modredus,</hi> the Son of <hi>Lothus,</hi> the <hi>Picts,</hi> both young Men of great Hope, and who had often given good Testimonies of their Valour and Conduct. This Army of Three Kings, being about Five Mile from the Enemy, and their Camps being distant one from another; The <hi>Saxons,</hi> being inform'd by their Spies, that the <hi>Picts</hi> (who were farthest distant from the other Forces) were very careless and secure, they made a suddain and unexpected Assault on them, in the Night. <hi>Modredus</hi> made a gallant Resistance for a time; at last, when things were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most desperate on his side, he mounted on an Horse with <hi>Gallanus,</hi> his Father-in-Law, and so fled to King <hi>Arthur. Arthur</hi> was nothing dismayed at the loss of the <hi>Picts,</hi> but spent that Day in setling things, which were discomposed; after that, his Army being commanded to march in the Third Watch, he came upon the Enemy, with a Treble Army; and was at the <hi>Saxons</hi> Camp, before they knew what the Matter was; The <note n="g" place="margin">And, at last, drive them out of a great part of <hi>Britain.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Saxons,</hi> being dismayed, ran up and down, having no time to take counsel, or to arm themselves; thus their Camp being entred, they were slain by the <hi>Brittons</hi>; and especially, the angry <hi>Picts</hi> were cruel to all without distinction.</p>
               <p>Some Writers of <hi>English</hi> Antiquities, say, That <hi>Arthur</hi> fought Twelve pitched Battels with the <hi>Saxons:</hi> But because they give us only the Names of the Places, where they were fought, and nothing else, I shall mention them no otherwise. To speak briefly of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Actions, This is manifest, That he wholly subdued the Forces of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and restored Peace to <hi>Britain;</hi> And when he went over to settle Things in <hi>Lesser Britain</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> he Trusted the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to <hi>Modredus,</hi> his Kinsman<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> who was to manage the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as King, till his Return. I have no certainty of the Exploits he performed in <hi>Gaul</hi>; As to what <hi>Geofry</hi> of <hi>Monmouth</hi> attributes to him there, it hath no shadow, much less likelyhood, of Truth in it; so that I pass them by, as impudently forged; and, as causelesly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved. But to return to the Matter.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:56771:84"/>Whilst <hi>Arthur</hi> was absent, and intent on setling the <hi>Gallick</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs; there were sown the Seeds of a War, most pernicious to <hi>Britain.</hi> There was a certain Man in <hi>Arthurs</hi> Retinue, named <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine,</hi> the Son of <hi>Cadoris</hi>; who, for the excellent Endowments both of his Body and Mind, was highly in all Mens Favour.

                  <hi>Modredus</hi> as nearest of Kin, and already accustomed to the Government, both in Peace and War; and One too, who had given good Proof of himself in his Viceroy-Ship; who, also, was likely to make no small Accession to the <hi>British</hi> Affairs. These things being spoken, the Multitude, who favoured <hi>Constantine,</hi> cryed out, That they would not have a Stranger to be their King; and that <hi>Britain</hi> was not so devoid of Men, but that it would afford a King within its own Territories: They ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded also, That it was a Foolish thing, to seek for that abroad, which they might have at home. <hi>Arthur</hi> knew before the Love of the People, to <hi>Constantine</hi>; and therefore, though being a Man other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise Ambitious, yet he easily took part with the People, and, from that day, shewed him openly, and cherished in him, the hopes of the Kingdom. <hi>Modredus</hi> his Friends took this ill, and looked upon it as a great wrong to him; they alleged, That by the League made by <hi>Arthur,</hi> with <hi>Lothus,</hi> it was expressly cautioned, That none should be preferred to the Succession of the Kingdom before the Sons of <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus:</hi> To which the contrary Party answered, that That League was extorted by the necessity of the Times, against the Common good of the whole Nation, and that they were not obliged to keep it, now <hi>Lothus,</hi> with whom it was made, was Dead. And that therefore the <hi>Picts</hi> would do well, to be contented with their own Bounds, and not to invade other Mens. That the Kingdom of <hi>Britain,</hi> by Gods Blessing, was now in that State, that it could not only defend it self against <hi>New</hi> Injuries, but also revenge the <hi>Old.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These things being brought to <hi>Modredus</hi> his Ear, did quite alienate his Mind from <hi>Arthur,</hi> and inclined him to set up for himself, by main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining his own Dignity; only he a little suspended the War, till he had tryed the Minds of the <hi>Scots</hi>; when they were brought over to his Party, an Army was listed consisting of many <hi>Picts, Scots,</hi> and <hi>Brittons,</hi> being induced to side with <note place="margin">

Hereupon a most feirce Fight began on both sides, but Two things did especially advantage <hi>Modredus</hi> and his Confederates;
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:56771:85"/>
One was, a Marsh in the midst between them, which the <hi>Brittons</hi> could not easily pass; and Another, in the heat of the Fight, there was one suborned, to spread a Report among the <hi>Brittons,</hi> that <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thur</hi> was slain, and therefore, all being lost, every one should shift for himself; at which Bruit, they all fled, yet there was great Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter on both sides; neither was the Victory joyous to either Party; for on the one side, <hi>Modredus</hi> was slain; and on the other, his Brother <hi>Galvinus; Arthur</hi> himself mortally Wounded, and a great Prey taken.</p>

                  <hi>Arthur,</hi> but they are not fit to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, lest they cause a Mist to be cast over his other famous Actions; for, when Men confidently affirm lies, they cause the Truth it self, many times, to be questioned. This is certain, he was a great Man, and very Valorous, bearing an intire Love to his Country, in freeing them from Servitude; in restoring the true Worship of God; and in reforming it, when it was corrupted: I have spoken these things concerning his Lineage, Life and Death, more prolixly, than the Nature of my Design required; for I never meant to Record all the Exploits of the <hi>Brittons,</hi> but to free and preserve the Affairs of our own Nation, from the Oblivion of Time, and the Fabulous Tales of some lewd and ill-disposed Writers. I have insisted longer on the Exploits of <hi>Arthur,</hi> partly because some do curtail them through Envy, and others do heighten them by their Verbosities. He died in the year of our Lord Five Hundred and Fifty Two, after he had Reigned 24 Years.</p>
               <p>But to return to the Affairs of <hi>Scotland; Goranus</hi> the King, now grown old, departed this Life, after he had governed <hi>Scotland</hi> Thirty four years; 'tis thought he was Treacherously slain by his Subjects: There was one <note n="k" place="margin">The People, by the Instiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Donald</hi> of <hi>Athol,</hi> Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Toncetus</hi>; and after that, the King <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranus</hi> himself.</note> 
                  <hi>Toncetus,</hi> Chief Justice in Criminal Matters, a Man no less Cruel than Covetous; he, having played many foul Pranks a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the richer sort, thought, he might easily get Pardon of all from the King, because, by this means he had augmented his Revenue. The People could not easily obtain admittance to the King, now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feebled by Age and Diseases, to make their Complaints; and, if they had Access, they judged their Allegations would not have been belei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved against such a principal Officer, and high Favourite. So that they set upon <hi>Toncetus,</hi> and slew him. But after the heat of their Anger was over, when they began to think with themselves, how foul a Fact they had committed, and that there was no Pardon to be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by them, they turned their Wrath and Fury upon the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and, by the Instigation of <hi>Donald</hi> of <hi>Athol,</hi> they entred into his Palace and slew <hi>Him</hi> also.</p>

He, as soon as he entred upon the Kingdom, set upon the straggling Plunderers, and curbed their Rashness, making a great Slaughter amongst them; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that, that he might strengthen his weak Forces by Foreign Aids, he sent Ambassadors, with great Gifts, to the <hi>English,</hi> which were nearest to him. They received their Gifts, and were large enough in their Promises of Assistance; but, though the <hi>Picts</hi> earnestly pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed them, yet they put them off, laying the fault on their own Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bustions at home. The <hi>Picts</hi> being disappointed of their Hope there, levied all of their Own, that were able to bear Arms, and resolved to venture their All; with this Resolution they marched directly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Enemy, who were encamped not far from <hi>Dundee.</hi> As soon as they met, the Battel was so much the more sharp, by reason of the old Hatred, the recent Disgust, the many mutual Slaughters, and the frequent Injuries and Wrongs, committed on both sides. When the Conflict was a long time doubtful, at last, an Hundred Horse of the <hi>Picts</hi> rose out of an Ambush; who, that they might seem to be a greater Number, did also Horse their Baggage Men, and Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, upon their Baggage Horses; and so, shewing themselves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the tops of the Hills, they wheeled about, as if they would have set upon the Rear of the Army, which was a Fighting. That appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension struck such a terrour into the <hi>Scots,</hi> that they presently scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, and fled into the Neighbouring Woods; by which many of them were saved alive; only some few were slain in the Fight, but more in flight, by the nimble Baggagers, who were set on Horseback. <note n="*" place="margin">King <hi>Alpin</hi> overthrown in Battel by the <hi>Picts,</hi> and slain.</note> King <hi>Alpinus,</hi> and many of his Nobles were taken Prisoners, and cruelly slain.

This Opinion prevailed, so that there was Peace betwixt the two Nations, for Three Years, as if it had been by common Consent. But in the Fourth Year, <hi>Kennethus,</hi> desirous to renew the War, yet fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding few of the Nobles of his Mind, invited them to a Banquet; <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Kenneteus,</hi> by a witty In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges his Nobles to make War upon the <hi>Picts.</hi>
                  </note> the Entertainment continued till late at Night, so that they were all necessitated to lodge there, which they might more easily do, in regard every Man, according to the custom of his Ancestors, lay on the Ground, and so they disposed of them in that large House, having nothing under them but Leaves and Grass. When they were gone to Bed, the King suborned a Youth, one of his Kinsmen, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to clothe himself with the Skins of Fishes, dried in the Wind, and so to enter by Night; and to speak through a long Tube, that the Voice might better reach their Ears at a distance, and thus to exhort them to War; as if a Message had been sent them from Heaven, to that purpose. The Nobles suddenly awoke at this Voice, which at that time seem'd to them to be Greater and more August than a Mans; many also were laden with Wine, and the sudden flashing of Light, from the Fishes Skins, darting upon their drowsie Eyes, and dazling them, drove them into a great Astonishment; in fine, an un-wonted Apparition affected the Eyes of them all, and a kind of Religious Consternation seized upon their Minds. And That which increased the Admiration, was, That the Messenger, stripping him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self of his disguised Habit, and, by a secret Passage, conveighing himself away, as in an instant, seemed to have vanished out of sight. When the News hereof was brought to the King in the Morning, and many did add to the Story, as is usual in such Cases, he also affirmed, That the like Apparition was seen by him, in his Sleep. Hereupon, a War was concluded upon by the general Consent of them all, as if they were Commanded thereunto by God himself. When the Armies were led forth to Battel, as soon as ever they came in fight one of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, every one ran upon the Enemy, which stood next to him, not staying for the Command of their Captains. The Fight was as fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly continued, as it was eagerly begun. At last, the Victory inclined to the <note n="*" place="margin">The <hi>Picts,</hi> being deserted by the <hi>English,</hi> receive a great overthrow by the <hi>Scots.</hi>

                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:56771:92"/>
and the rest, whom they had taken Prisoners: But that which chiefly inflamed their Minds, was a Watch-Word, spread abroad among the <hi>Scots, That they should remember</hi> Alpinus; From that very moment, they spared neither Age, nor Rank, of Men: The Hills co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the departure of the <hi>English,</hi> and the <hi>Scots</hi> were so pertinaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously intent in revenging themselves on the <hi>Picts,</hi> that they could not follow them. This Victory reduced the <hi>Picts</hi> to so low an ebb, and rendred their Condition so deplorable, that, though they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to make Peace, yet all was in vain, for the <hi>Scots</hi> would hearken to no Conditions, but the full surrendring up of their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. The next Year, when all Places were surrendred up beyond <hi>Forth,</hi> Northwards; and Garisons placed in them, as <hi>Kennethus</hi> was marching his Army against those on this side thereof, word was brought, That some of the Garisons, which he had left behind, were taken, and the Souldiers slain: Hereupon, he marched his Army back against the Rebellious <hi>Picts,</hi> of whom he spared neither Man, Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, nor Child; But wasted the whole Country with Fire and Sword. <hi>Druskenus,</hi> seeing the <hi>Picts</hi> were inraged, almost like Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, at the Cruelty exercised over them, and knowing now, that they must fight, not for their Kingdom, but for their very Lives, and the Lives of their Wives and Children, gathered together all the Force that ever he could make; and so passing the <hi>Forth,</hi> came to <hi>Scone,</hi> a Town situate on the Bank of the River <hi>Tay,</hi> where he wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the coming of the <hi>Scots:</hi> There they again endeavoured to make a Pacification, offering to surrender all the Country beyond the <hi>Forth,</hi> but the <hi>Scots</hi> would have All, or none. The Fight, as in such Circumstances of Necessity, was very fierce: At last, the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinacy of the <hi>Picts</hi> was broken, and the River <hi>Tay,</hi> putting a stop to their flight, was the cause of their Destruction. For <note n="*" place="margin">The <hi>Picts</hi> again routed by the <hi>Scots,</hi> their King <hi>Drusken</hi> slain, and their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom abolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> 
                  <hi>Drus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenus,</hi> and almost all his Nobility, being not able to pass it, were there slain: And the Fortune of the common Souldiers was not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; for as they crowded to the River in several places to save them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, they laboured also under the same incapacity of passing it, and so they every one of them lost their Lives. Hence it is, (as I judge,) that our Writers say, We Fought with the <hi>Picts</hi> seven times in one Day. The Force of the <hi>Picts</hi> was wholly broken by this Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, and <hi>Kennethus</hi> wasted <hi>Lothian</hi> and the adjacent Country, together with Those beyond the <hi>Forth,</hi> that they might never be able again to recover themselves.

               <hi>Kennethus,</hi> the Son of <hi>Alpinus,</hi> a Third Founder, also. <hi>Fergus</hi> the First, from a mean beginning, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced the Affairs of the <hi>Scots</hi> to such an height, as that they were Envy'd by their Neighbours. <hi>Fergus</hi> the Second, when they were banished and dispersed into remote Countrys, and, in the Judgment of their Enemies, almost extirpated, did, as it were, recal them to Life, and, in a few years, reduced them to their Ancient Splendor. But <hi>Kennethus</hi> was so Couragious, as to accept of the Kingdom, when Matters were almost desperate; yea, when others thought, that the small remainder of <hi>Scots</hi> could hardly have been defended, or kept together; and not only so, but he brake the power of the Enemy, (tho' assisted with Foreign aid, and Triumphant also for his late Victory) in many sharp (yet prosperous) Fights; and, being thus weakned, he drave him out of <hi>Britanny,</hi> and took from him the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Name, which to this day he could never recover again. Tho' these were <hi>Great</hi> Atchievements, yet they were not the <hi>Greatest</hi> he performed; For, as he enlarged his Kingdom to double of what it was before; so he Governed it, both by making New Laws, and also by reviving the Old ones; That neither Licentiousness arising from War, nor Pride, the product of Victory, nor any footsteps of those Evils, which are wont to accompany Luxury and Ease, did appear, during his Life. Yea, the Affairs of <hi>Scotland</hi> seem'd to be supported for many Years after, by the Laws, called, by Posterity, the <note n="g" place="margin">The whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some Laws, made by <hi>Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,</hi> called <hi>Mac-Alpin-Laws,</hi> because he was the Son of <hi>Alpin.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>COnstantinus,</hi> the Son of <hi>Kennethus,</hi> undertook the Kingdom af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, at <hi>Scone</hi>; he was a Prince of a great Spirit, and highly Valorous. He was desirous to obliterate the Ignominy received un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Donaldus,</hi> and to enlarge his Kingdom unto the Bounds, left by his Father; but he was otherwise advised by his Nobles, because the greatest part of the Soldiery were slain under <hi>Donaldus</hi>; and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder was grown so Corrupt, that it was not fit to put Arms in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their hands. And thereupon, the King first bent his care to amend the Publick Discipline; and so he reduced the Order of Priests to their Ancient Parsimony, by severe Laws, in regard they had left off Preaching, and had given up themselves to <note n="*" place="margin">Ecclesiasticks Reformed by <hi>Constantine.</hi>
                  </note> Luxury, Hunting, Hawking, and to Courtly-Pomp. He caused the Young Soldiers, who were effeminated with Pleasures, to lye on the Ground, and to Eat but once a day. <note n="f" place="margin">Drunkenness Punished with Death.</note> Drunkards he punished with Death. He forbad all sports, but those who served to harden both Body and Mind, for the Wars. By these Laws, the Soldiery of the Kingdom were reduced to a better pass. And presently upon, a certain Islan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, named <hi>Evenus,</hi> whom he himself had made Governour of <hi>Loch-Abyr,</hi> a Man of an unquiet Spirit, and Ambitious of Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, rose up in Arms; who, knowing, That the Youthful Fry of Soldiers could not well bear the Severity of these New Laws, First, gathered together a small Number, and then a greater, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of the present State of Things. And when he found his Discourse was acceptable to them, he easily persuaded them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire for the Destruction of <hi>Constantine.</hi> But, being more active than cautelous in gathering strength to their Faction, they were betrayed by some of their Own, and slain, before they knew any Forces were gathered together against them. <note n="g" place="margin">

                  <hi>Evenus,</hi> the head of the Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, was hanged.

                  <hi>Danes,</hi> then the most Potent and Flourishing Nation amongst the <hi>Germans,</hi> were solicited by the <hi>Picts</hi> against the <hi>Scots,</hi> and also by one <hi>Buernus,</hi> (or, as others write, <hi>Verna,</hi> whose Wife <hi>Osbreth</hi> had forceably Vitiated) which They, being over-stocked with Youngsters at home, easily as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to, and so they transported themselves, in a great Navy, into <hi>Britain.</hi> Their first Descent was in <hi>Fife,</hi> there they slew all they met, without distinction, out of Hatred to the <hi>Christian</hi> Religion; and dividing their Army, they spoiled the Country two several ways. <hi>Constantinus</hi> drew forth against them, and first he set upon that Brigade, which <hi>Hubba,</hi> Brother to the <hi>Danish</hi> King, commanded; who, being hindred to joyn with their Fellows, by the sudden swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the River <hi>Levin,</hi> were there easily overcome and slain, except a few of his Men, who could swim over the River, who fled to their other Commander, called <hi>Humber. Constantinus</hi> followed after them, as to a Prey, not a Battel, and overtook them not far from the Town of <note n="*" place="margin">On the East-point of <hi>Fife.</hi>

                  <hi>Carail,</hi> but not before they had well fortify'd their Camp. For the <hi>Danes,</hi> being very provident after their late unhappy Fight, had made a kind of Defensive Fortification, upon some small Winding Rocks, near the shore, by heaping up a parcel of Stones together,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:56771:95"/>
which lay thereabouts. In that posture, <hi>Constantine</hi> assaulted them; where, by reason of the Incommodiousness of the place, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speration of the <hi>Danes,</hi> he paid dear for his Rashness; for he lost a great Part of his Army, he himself being taken Prisoner, and haled into a little Cave, hard by, was there slain. There are some Monuments of this Fight remaining to this day, as the Cave, the Circumference of their Camp, which was not cut out regularly, or by equal spaces, but turning and winding according to the Bending of the Rocks. Some lay the blame of this unlucky Accident upon the <hi>Picts,</hi> who, being admitted into <hi>Constantines</hi> Fealty and Army, were the first that ran away, and drew the greatest Part of the Army after them. The <hi>Danes</hi> gathered up the Spoils, and departed to their Ships. The Kings Body was found the day after, and carried to the Sepulchres of his Ancestors in the Island <hi>Icolumb-kil.</hi> He possessed the Kingdom sixteen Years, and died in the Year of our Lord 874.</p>

The <hi>Danes,</hi> when he came to <hi>Berwick,</hi> fearing, if they should have any Misfortune, the <hi>English</hi> also would be upon their backs, durst not join in a Field-fight with <hi>Gregory</hi>; but sent Part of their Forces over the River into <hi>Northumberland,</hi> commanding them to join with a small Brigade of their Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who had gathered themselves together, and were newly landed, there; The Rest of them enter'd <hi>Berwick</hi> to strengthen the Garison there. But the <hi>English,</hi> who were, but unwillingly, under the Command of the <hi>Danes,</hi> (as being Men of a different Religion from them) gave admission to the <hi>Scots</hi> in the night, by which means all the <hi>Danes</hi> were put to the Sword. From thence, <hi>Gregory</hi> marched into <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and fought a prosperous Battel against <hi>Hardnute,</hi> wherein he made so great a slaughter of them, that their Numbers, which were lately formidable to all <hi>Britain,</hi> were mightily diminished, partly by <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and partly by <hi>Alfrid</hi> of <hi>England. Gregory</hi> took in all <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and gave free leave to those <hi>English</hi> to depart, who were willing so to do; to the rest, he very courteously distributed Lands. The greatest part of the <hi>English</hi> staid behind, partly out of love to their native Soil, partly by reason of the Kings Bounty to them; and partly also, for fear of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. For, seeing they had now, for many years, had several cruel Fights with the <hi>Danes,</hi> the Victory being many times uncertain, Many of the <hi>English</hi> chose rather to be under the Dominion of the <hi>Scots</hi>; who, though formerly Enemies, were yet <hi>Christians,</hi> than either to fall into the power of the Bloody <hi>Danes</hi>; or, to hope for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain Aid from their own Countrymen; especially, since things were in such an hurly burly over all <hi>Britanny,</hi> that the <hi>English</hi> knew not which Party to succour, first. After he had so chastised the <hi>Danes,</hi> that he expected no more Trouble from them, he turned his Arms upon the <hi>Brittons,</hi> who, as yet, held some of the <hi>Scotish</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions; with These also he made Peace, they restoring the the said <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Their End in so doing, was, to take off the Edge of <hi>Gregorys</hi> Valour by delay, and to force him to withdraw his Army from a Foreign harassed Country, for want of Provisions. <hi>Gregory</hi> smelt out their Design, and therefore, very secretly, in the Night, he sent part of his Army to seize upon an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he committed the Care of the Young King to such of his Old Counsellors, as he judged most faithful to him; and himself bore the Name of his Tutor or Guardian, till he came to be of Age: He also put Garisons into the Forts, and exacted an Oath from the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility; That they should admit neither <hi>English, Dane,</hi> nor <hi>Britton</hi> into the Island, without his Permission: He appointed Judges in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Places, who were to judge betwixt Man and Man in matters of Controversy, according to the Laws of the Country; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Sixty Hostages for the performance of these Conditions, he returned home in Triumph.

Thus, no <hi>Common</hi> causes of the disease discovering its self, they had recourse to a <hi>Secret</hi> one. And whilst all were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent on the Kings Malady, at last News was brought, That Nightly Assemblies and Conspiracies were made against him at <hi>Foress,</hi> a Town in <hi>Murray:</hi> The Report was taken for truth, there being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to contradict it: Whereupon, some faithful Messengers were sent to <hi>Donald,</hi> Governor of the Castle, in whom the King confided much, even in his greatest Affairs, to find out the truth of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. He, by the discovery of a certain Harlot, whose Mother was noted for a Wizard, detected and discovered the whole Conspiracy. For the Young Girl, having blabbed out, a few days before, some words concerning the Sickness and Death of the King; being appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, and brought to the Rack to be tortured, at sight thereof, presently discovered, what was designed against the Life of the King. Whereupon some Soldiers were sent, who found the Maids Mother and some other Gossips, Roasting the Kings Picture, made in Wax, by a soft Fire; Their design was, that, as the Wax did leisurely melt, so the King, being dissolved into a Sweat, should pine away by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees; and when the Wax was quite consumed, then, his breath failing him, he should presently die; when this Picture of Wax was broken, and the Witches punished, in the same Month the King was freed from his Disease, as some say. These things I deliver, as I receiv'd them from our Ancestors: What to think of this sort of Witchcraft, I leave to the Judgment of the Reader, only minding him, That this story is found amongst our Ancient <hi>Archives</hi> and Records.

<pb n="184" facs="tcp:56771:100"/>
intent on Thoughts of Revenge; for he judged, That his deserts from the King were so great, that, whatever he asked of him, he ought not to be denied: And besides, the Wife of <hi>Donald,</hi> seeing some of her Kindred too, were like to suffer, did further inflame the, already disaffected, Heart of her Husband, by bitter words; Moreover exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him, to attempt the Kings Death, affirming, That, seeing he was Governor of the Castle, The Kings Life was in his Power; and, having that Power, he might not only perpetrate the Fact, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal it, after it was committed: Hereupon, when the King, tired with business, was sounder asleep than ordinary, and his Attendants, being made Drunk by <note n="*" place="margin">King <hi>Duffus</hi> treacherously Murdered by <hi>Donald</hi> and his Wife.</note>

This seems a more likely story to me, than what others write, that the course of the River was turned, and so his Body was cast into a hole at Bottom; but when the Waters were returned again to their own Chanel, then his Grave, such as it was, was covered. Also the Actors of that bloody Fact were sent away, because there is an <note n="*" place="margin">A Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Opinion, still obtaining; Especially, if the Murtherer touch the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered Body.</note> Opinion, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from our Ancestors, which as yet obtains amongst the Vulgar, <hi>That blood will Issue from a dead Body, many days after the party was murdered, if the murderer be present, as if the fact had been but newly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</hi> The day after, when the Report was spread abroad, that the King was missing, and that his Bed was besprinkled with blood, <hi>Donald,</hi> as if he had been surpriz'd at the atrocity of the Fact, flys into the Kings Bed-Chamber; and, as if he had been mad with An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and Revenge, he slew the Officers appointed to attend him; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that, he presently made diligent inquiry every where, if any dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the dead Body might be made.

This he did out of fear, lest the Truth should have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted from him, by the Rack. This his hasty flight, his dejected Countenance, (as it was observed) his few Attendants, his trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling at his entrance into the Ship, which was but casually riding there, without any preparation for his Voyage; did raise so great a suspicion upon him in the minds of all, who were present, that they forbore not to vent all manner of Contumelies against him, calling him an Impious, Sacrilegious, Fellow, and a Paricide, and what other foul terms of reproach their inflamed anger could suggest. They ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded also, That, though he had prevented the coming of the King, yet he could never avoid the Vindictive Providence and Judgment of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God. In a word, they followed him with all the Execrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which the highest Indignation did offer to provoked Minds, even till the Ship was quite out of sight. When <hi>Culenus</hi> heard of his hasty flight, he speeded his march thither, where he apprehended the Wife of <hi>Donaldus,</hi> and his three Children; and, for fear of Torture, compelled them to discover the whole Series of the Conspiracy; as also how, by whom, and where the Body was buried; and that she her self was not only privy to the Murder, but also a fellow-actor in it, and a persuader of her Husband, thereunto. When the People heard this, (for she was publickly Tried) the Magistrates could hardly dissuade them from tearing her to pieces. The day after, <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naldus,</hi> having been tossed some days, with contrary Winds at Sea, was Shipwracked and cast ashore, and being brought to the King,<note n="*" place="margin">The Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers of <hi>Duf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus</hi> apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted.</note>

<pb n="186" facs="tcp:56771:101"/>
by his Panders, in his Court, as in a Brothel-house. When he was admonished, and put in mind of these things, by Wise and Prudent Persons; on the behalfe of the young Nobility, he answered, That something was to be indulged to their Age; and as for himself, thÃ´ he confessed, That, some things were amiss, yet he was forced, out of fear, to tolerate them: For, I remember, said he, what great Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity the unseasonable Severity of the former King brought, not only on himself, but on the whole Kingdom also: That the Nobility were the Stay and Prop of the Throne; That it was not true, that the Martial Spirits of Men were always broken by this free kind of Life, or made low and abject; nor, That the Thoughts of Arms were so neglected by them in Peace, as if they expected, That there would never be any more War at all. 'Tis true, (proceeded he) The Luxury of Youthful Age is so far to be restrained, that it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed not too far, that so the good Seed of Ingenuity might not be choaked (as it were) by overmuch jollity, in the very bud; yet, it is not <hi>wholly</hi> to be abridged, or taken away, lest the Seeds of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue should be plucked up together with it. When the Nobles heard this his Defensatory Plea; and perceiving, they could do no good up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, by their Persuasions, but rather create trouble to themselves, if they should use the same liberty of Speech to him in their Rejoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, they withdrew themselves from the Court, fearing, lest they should be compelled to be Witnesses, yea, Partakers also, of these facinorous Practices, the sight and hearing whereof they did detest, and abhor. The King, being freed from such troublesom Interposers, gave up himself wholly to Wine and Women. He proposed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to those, who could invent any new kind of Pleasure, thÃ´ ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so sordid and detestable; His Court was filled, Night and Day, with wanton Songs and the Huzza's of Drunkards; So that, Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Impudence were as much praised by him, as Modesty and Chastity are wont to be esteemed by Good and Pious Princes. Those Evils, which, thÃ´ allowed, or connived at, by the Law, in other Men, yet are acted by Them in <hi>Secret,</hi> were here <hi>openly</hi> committed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Shame.

Now was the time, when they might redeem both Themselves from Crime, and the Kingdom from being molested by Robberies. This was easy to be done, if those, which were most powerful in every County, would cause the Malefactors to be apprehended and brought to condign punishment, where those Malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors were, was visible to all. But if they made Excuses, and, having so fair Opportunity to merit well of their Country, were willingly defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to improve it. The King, to whose Care the safety of the whole was committed, could not be excused, if he set them at Liberty, before the Offenders were brought to Punishment, and that This was the End, why he detained them in Custody: And if any one thought, his long du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance would be a trouble to him, he might thank himself, seeing it was in his own Power, not only to procure his Liberty, but also to obtain Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, Reward, and the Praise of all Good Men into the bargain.</hi> The Nobles having heard this Harangue, unanimously answered, <hi>That they had rather assert their Innocency by Deeds, than Words.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, they promised him their Assistance, and desired him to lay aside all Suspition, if he had conceived a sinister Opinion of any of them. Upon this their Solemn Engagement, the King told them the Names of the Offenders.

They further urged, That it was not the part of Great and Magnanimous Spirits, to be intent on Prey and Booty only, they should rather call to mind the Blood of their Kindred and Ancestors, who had been so often cruelly slain in <hi>Scotland</hi>: And that now especially, having a Great Army, and being furnished also with things necessary for War, they ought to take That Revenge, which might punish the Savage Cruelty of the <hi>Scots,</hi> according to their Deserts, and might also carry the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of the <hi>Danish</hi> Name to all the Neighbouring Nations.</p>
               <p>This last Opinion prevailed, so that they Sailed their Navy to the Mouth of the River of <hi>Eske</hi>;<note place="margin">Which Lands in <hi>Scotland.</hi>

could not, without much hazard, be attacqued; the Archers and Darts-men compelled them to come down, insomuch that a most Cruel Fight began at the bottom of the Hill; much Blood was spilt, and the Victory uncertain; when the <hi>Danes</hi> gave forth a Word, thro' their whole Army, <hi>That no man must ever hope to return again to their Camp, unless as a Conquerour.</hi> Whereupon, making a great shout, they made such a brisk Charge and Assault upon the <hi>Scots,</hi> that they routed Both their Wings, and eagerly followed the Pursuit.

He, with some few Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were admitted in, without Suspicion, and being once entred, he gave the Word to the rest, who lay in Ambush, and let in them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so; so that he slew his Grandfather, with his whole Family, plunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Castle, depopulated the Country adjacent; and, as if he had done a Famous Exploit, he returned pompously with a great Booty into <hi>Mern.</hi> But the <hi>Angusians</hi> did not suffer this Injury to pass long Unrevenged: For, soon after, gathering a great many of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction together, they made great Havock in the District of <hi>Mern.</hi> From that time forward, Slaughters and Rapines were occasionally committed on both sides. <hi>Kennethus,</hi> hearing of it, published a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, That the <hi>Chief</hi> of either Faction should appear at <hi>Scone,</hi> within Fifteen Days, to answer, What should be objected against them; for he feared, that if a greater number should resort to the Factions, further Tumults might arise; some few being terrified by this minatory Edict, made their appearance accordingly; but the greatest part, of whom <hi>Crathilinthus</hi> was Chief, being conscious of
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:56771:104"/>
their own Demerits, fled away, as every one thought most conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. The King made diligent search after them, the greatest part of them were taken in <hi>Loch-Abyr,</hi> and some, elsewhere. <note n="*" place="margin">But is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, and put to Death</note> 
                  <hi>Crathilinthus,</hi> and the Cheif of the Faction, were punished with Death; others, according to the Degree of their Crimes, had lesser Punishments, and those who were but a little Guilty, had none at all inflicted on them.</p>
               <p>This Moderation and Temperament procured to the King Fear from the bad, but great Love from others; and settled Peace in all his Kingdom, till the Twenty first year of his Reign. Insomuch, That, if he had persisted in that course of Life, which he had begun, he might well have been reckoned amongst the Best of Princes; for, he so performed all the Offices both of Peace and War, that he got great Renown upon the account of his Equity, Impartiality and Valour. But the Excellency of his former Life was blurred by one Wicked Fact that he committed, which seemed, too, more aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in him, in regard it was incredible, and unexpected to proceed from his Disposition, who had before, so severely punished Grand Offenders. The Occasion of it was This: The King, being now grown somewhat ancient, had a Son named <hi>Malcolm,</hi> a Prince of great Ingenuity, but in point of Age, not yet mature to Govern so fierce a People, if his Father should die. Further, the Custom of our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors was then against it, that he should Reign next after his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For, They were wont to choose not the <hi>next,</hi> but the <hi>fittest,</hi> of the deceased Kings Relations, provided, he were descended from <hi>Fergus</hi> the First, King of the <hi>Scots.</hi> Besides, the Favour of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility was another Obstacle, which did incline to another <hi>Malcolm,</hi> the Son of King <hi>Duffus,</hi> the most Praise-Worthy Prince of all the <hi>Scotish</hi> Royal Race: Moreover, he was then Governor of <hi>Cumberland,</hi> which County the <hi>Scots</hi> did hold as Feudataries of the Kings of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> on such Terms, That the Government of <hi>Cumberland</hi> was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways looked upon as previous to the Throne of <hi>Scotland</hi>; for it had been so observed, for some Ages past. The King, perceiving,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Kenneth</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brues his Hands in the Blood of the hopeful Prince, and his Kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </note> That this <hi>Malcolm,</hi> for the Reasons aforementioned, would be an hindrance to his Design, not daring to do it openly, caused him privately to be made away by Poyson. Thus died that excellent young Man, much lamented and near to his greatest Hope; some Signs of Poison ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in his Body, but no Man ever dreamt of suspecting the King. Yea, his Deportment was such, as to avert all Suspicion; for he Mourned and Wept for his Death, and made an Honourable mention of his Name, when occasion was administred to speak of it; and caused him magnificently to be Interred, no Ceremony being omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which could be invented for the Honour of the Deceased. But this superlative Diligence of the King, to remove the Suspicion from himself, gave a shrewd Jealousie to the more Sagacious. Yet, they forbore to speak out, for the Reverence all bore to, and had conceived of the Kings Sanctity. But soon after, the King himself scattred some Words abroad, to try the Minds of Men, How they would bear the abrogating of an <hi>old</hi> Law, and the enacting a <hi>new,</hi> concerning the Succession of their Kings, <hi>viz. That according to the Custom of many Nations, if a King died, his Son should succeed him; and if he were
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:56771:105"/>
under Age, then to have a Protector or Tutor assigned to him, so the Kingly Name might rest in the Child; but the Power of Government, in the Tutors or Guardians, till he came to Age.</hi> Though a great Part of the Nobles praised his Speech, as being willing to Gratifie him; yet, the Suspicion concerning the Death of <hi>Malcolm</hi> prevailed upon the Major part, and especially upon the Nobility, and Those of the Royal Stock, who were afraid of the King.</p>
               <p>Mens Spirits being in this posture, Ambassadors came from <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to comfort the King upon the loss of his Kinsman; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, desiring, That, in substituting another Governor, he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, That <hi>Cumberland</hi> being the Bond of Concord betwixt the Two Nations, he would set Such a Person over it, who might be an indifferent Arbiter of Peace, and that would maintain the ancient Alliance betwixt the Two Nations,<note place="margin">

The King judged this Embassy fit for his purpose; so, that having Convened the Nobility at <hi>Scone,</hi> he made a grave Harangue to them, against the ancient Custom of the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of Estates, in this Point; wherein he recited all the Seditions which had happened for that Cause; and with how great Impiety, some of the surviving Kindred had treated the Children of former Kings; and what Wars, Rapines, Slaughters, and Banish<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>nts, had ensued thereupon. On the other side, he put them in Mind<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> How much more Peaceable, and less Turbulent, the Parliamen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>y Assemblies of other Countries were; and what great Reverence was born to the Royal Blood; when, without convasing for Succession, Children succeeded their Parents in the Throne. Having thus spoken, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred the matter to that Great Council, to determine something in this Case: He acquainted them also with the Demands of the <hi>English</hi> Ambassador; and, to give a greater Manifestation of his Condescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Civility, whereas it was in the Kings Power alone, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point a Governor of <hi>Cumberland,</hi> he left it to them to nominate One; supposing, that by this his Moderation, he might the more easily obtain his Desire, concerning the Succession to the Crown: For, if he himself had Nominated his Son for a Governor, he thought, he should have prejudiced his other Request, because, as I said before, the Government or Prefecture over <hi>Cumberland</hi> was looked upon as the Designation of the Person, to be the next succeeding King of <hi>Scotland. Constantine,</hi> the Son of <hi>Culenus,</hi> and <hi>Grimus,</hi> the Son of <hi>Mogal,</hi> Brother to King <hi>Duffus,</hi> who were thought most likely to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose both Requests, were first asked their Opinions, in the Case; who, partly for Fear of Danger; and partly, that they might not run cross to the Major part of the Nobility, who had been preposses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and influenc'd by the King, gave their Vote, <hi>That it was in the Kings Power,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">And carries the Point.</note> 
                  <hi>to Correct and Amend Laws, which were inconvenient to the Publick; and also, to appoint what Governor he pleased over</hi> Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland. The rest, though they knew, that they had spoken contrary to their own Sense, yet Consented to what they said. And by this means, <hi>Malcolm,</hi> the Kings Son, though not of Age, but Immature for Government, was declared Governor of <hi>Cumberland</hi>; and also Prince of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which Title signifies in <hi>Scotland,</hi> as much as

Other Laws were also made, <hi>viz. That as the Kings Eldest Son should succeed his Father; so, if the Son died before the Father, the Nephew should succeed the Grandfather: That when the King was under Age, a Tutor or Protector should be Chosen, some Eminent Man for Interest and Power, to Govern in the Kings Name and stead, till he came to Fourteen Years of Age, and then he had Liberty to choose Guardians for Himself.</hi> And besides, many other Things were Enacted concerning the Legitimate Succession of Heirs, which ran in common to the whole Nobility, as well as to the King. The King having thus, by indirect and evil Practises, setled the Kingdom on his Posterity, as he thought; yet, his Mind was not at rest. For,<note place="margin">

At last, a Voice was heard from Heaven, either a true one, as some think; or else, such an one, as his disquieted Mind suggested, (as it commonly happens to Guilty Consciences) speaking to him, in his Sleep, to this Sense. <hi>Dost thou think, That the Murder of</hi> Malcolm, <hi>an Innocent Man,</hi>

They, instead of prescribing him a <hi>true</hi> Remedy, according to the Doctrine of <hi>Christ,</hi> (being then degenerated, themselves, from the Piety and Simplicity of their Ancestors) enjoyned him those absurd and fallacious ones, which Evil and Self-minded Men had devised for their own Gain; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wary People had as greedily received; which were, To bestow Gifts on Temples, and Holy Places; To visit the Sepulchres of Holy Men;<note place="margin">Mock-Plaisters applied to <hi>Kenneth</hi>'s wounded Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, by S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

At length, when he came to <hi>Mern</hi> to Worship, and to do Reverence to the Bones of <hi>Palladius,</hi> an Holy Person; he turned aside to view a Neighbouring Castle; called <note n="*" place="margin">Situate at the Foot of <hi>Clermont</hi> in <hi>Mern.</hi>

                  <hi>Fethercarn,</hi> which was then, as 'tis reported, very pleasant with shady Grows and Piles of curious Buildings, of which, almost no Footsteps remain, at this day. The Lady of that Castle was called <hi>Fenella,</hi> of whom Mention is made before; who bore the King a grudge, not only for the Punishment of her Son <hi>Crathilinthus,</hi> but
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:56771:106"/>
also upon the account of her Kinsmen, <hi>Constantinus,</hi> and <hi>Grimus</hi>; who, by his New Law, were excluded from the Succession to the Crown. But, dissembling her Anger, she entertained the King ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry splendidly, and with great Magnificence; and, after Dinner, she carried him out to view the Pleasantness of the Place, and the Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of the Castle; and amongst the rest, she led him into a Privy Parlor, to see a <note n="*" place="margin">A strange Mechanical Statue or En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine.</note> Brass Statue, most Curiously and Artificially cast, which was made with so much Ingeniousness, as they say, That when a String or Cord, which was secretly bent therein, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted and let go, it would shoot out Arrows, of its own accord; and, whilst the King was intent in viewing this Engine, an Arrow privily darted out therefrom, and slew him. <hi>Iohannes Major,</hi> and <hi>Hector Boetius,</hi> do Both say, That the King came thus to his End; though, in my Judgment, it be not very probable. For, it is not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That, after the decay of Noble Arts amongst other Nations, so curious a Statue should be then made; and that, in the remotest part of <hi>Britain,</hi> too; though <hi>Iohn Major</hi> writes, That <hi>Edmond</hi> the Son of <hi>Eldred,</hi> was slain by the same Artifice; but Both Stories are Fabulous, as I suppose. Neither can I easily persuade my self, That all <hi>Scotland</hi> did possess so many Jewels, as <hi>Boetius</hi> affirms, that One Lady was owner of.

He further alleged, That the Inconvenience of the Law was very Manifest and Visible, in it self. For, What, said he, can be more Imprudent and Foolish, than to take away One of the greatest concerns in Government, from the Suffrage of the Wise, and to leave it to the Liberty of Fortune? And to bind themselves to Obey a Child, because casually born of a King, who, perhaps, might be ruled by some Woman; and, in the mean time, to exclude Brave and Virtuous Men, from sitting at the Helm? He added further, What if the Children of the King should have some Defect, either of Mind or Body, which made them unfit for Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment? If Children (proceeded he) had enjoyed the Kingdom, in those days, wherein we fought so many Battels, with the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, Britains, Picts, English,</hi> and <hi>Danes</hi>; the Question would not

then have been, Who should Rule over us? But rather<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Whether we should have been any People at all, to be governed by any Body? Yea, What can border more upon Madness, than to bring That upon our selves by a Law, which God threatens as the severest Judgment to the Rebellious; and by this means, either to despise the Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and Predictions of the Almighty; or, to run into them of our own accord? Neither (said he) is that True, which the Flatterers of <hi>Kenneth</hi> please themselves with in urging, <hi>i. e.</hi> That the Slaughters and Avarice of the Kings Kindred may be avoided hereby; for the Kings Children, whilst under Age, have as much Reason to fear the Frauds of their Guardians; as before they did the Plots of their Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred. And therefore, now the Tyrant is removed, let us valiantly recover the Liberty he took away; and, abrogating that Law, which was enacted by Force, and submitted to out of Fear, (if it may be called a Law, and not rather a publick Enslavement, and Prostitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Freedom:) Let us, I say, return to the ancient Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Customs, by which this Kingdom arose, almost out of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; and which, from small Beginnings, have advanced it to that Splendour, that it is inferiour to none of its Neighbours; Yea, and when it was at a low Ebb, have erected it again. And therefore, let us not neglect, or over-slip, this present Opportunity, which offers it self, lest, hereafter, we seek it Vain. By these, and the like Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangues, he cajolled some of the Nobles, and drew a Multitude of the Commons to his Party; who assembled at <hi>Scone,</hi> Twelve days after the Funeral of <hi>Kennethus,</hi> and declared him King.</p>

                  <g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> who was busie about the Concern of his Fathers Funeral, hearing, that <hi>Constantine</hi> was made King, called his Friends together, to deliberate, what was fit to be done. Some were of Opinion, That, before he proceeded any further, he should found how the Minds of the Nobles stood affected, that so he might know, what strength he was able to raise against a popular Man, supported by so many Factions and Alliances; and then, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Number of his Forces, to take a Resolution. But those who were young and head-strong, despised this Course, as slow and dilatory; alleging, That it was best to obviate the Danger at its first Rise, and to proceed against the Enemy, before he was set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in his new Kingdom. The King being young, embraced the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Opinion, as the more specious of the Two, and having gathered an Army of about Ten Thousand Men together, marches towards the Enemy. Neither was <hi>Constantine</hi> defective in his Preparations; for, in a short time, he levied so great an Army, that <hi>Malcolm,</hi> at the news of his Approach, disbanded his Soldiers, and retired himself into <hi>Cumberland.</hi> But <hi>Kennethus,</hi> his Natural Brother, begot on a Concubine, judging that course to be very Dishonourable, persuaded some of the most Valiant Troops to stay behind, and so to stop the Enemy at the River <hi>Forth</hi> near <hi>Sterling,</hi> which was the Boundary to both Armies. There both Camps lay idle on the high Banks of the River, which was Fordable but in few places; by which means, they were so afflicted with Pestilence and Famine, (both which Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities did rage very much, that Year) that each Army was forced to Disband. Thus, the Kingdom being divided into Two Factions,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:56771:107"/>
the Commonalty was miserably afflicted with Hunger, Pestilence, and frequent Robberies. In the mean time, during the absence of <hi>Malcolm,</hi> who, according to his League, was assisting the <hi>English</hi> against the <hi>Danes, Constantine,</hi> thinking he had now got a convenient Opportunity to subdue the Faction opposite to him, marches with great Forces into <hi>Lothian. Kennethus,</hi> who was left by his Brother to observe all <hi>Constantine</hi>'s Motions, gave him an halt at the Mouth of the River <note n="*" place="margin">Or Almond-water, dividing <hi>Mid-Lothian,</hi> from <hi>West-Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian,</hi> or <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lithgoshire.</hi>

For the <hi>Constantinians,</hi> trusting to their Multitude, rushed violently into the Battel, having the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beams darting into their very Faces; and besides, a Storm, suddainly arising, drove so much Dust into their Faces and Eyes, that they could scarce lift up their Heads against their Enemies.

<q>That <hi>Grimus</hi> should retain the Name of King, as long as he lived: And, that, after his Decease, the Kingdom should return to <hi>Malcolm</hi>; And, for the future, the Law of <hi>Kennethus,</hi> for establishing the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession in the King's Children, should be observed as Sacred and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violate. In the mean time, the Wall of <hi>Severus</hi> was to be the Boundary to them Both. That which was within the Wall was to belong to <hi>Malcolm</hi>; and That without, to <hi>Grimus.</hi> Both of them were to be contented with those Limits, Neither being to invade each other, or to assist the Enemies of one another.</q>
Thus Peace was made, to the great Joy of all Men, which was Religiously observed for almost Eight Years. <hi>Grimus</hi> was the first Occasion of the Breach, for where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, since the beginning of his Reign, in turbulent Times, he had car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried himself as a good Prince, his Industry being slackened by the Quiet he enjoyed, he wholly plunged himself in voluptuous Courses; and that kind of Life, being, as usually it is, a Life of Expence, he was reduced to some Necessity, and was thereby enforced to pretend Crimes against the Richer sort, that so, out of Covetousness, he might enjoy their Estates. Being told of the danger of this Course, he was so far from Reforming it; or, from abating any thing of his former Vileness, That he resolved to put his Monitors in Prison, that so others, being terrified by their Punishment, might not use the like freedom, in reproving Kings. In order whereto, he invited them kindly to his Court, but they, having notice of his Design, by their Friends, withdrew themselves; at which, <hi>Grimus</hi> was so enraged, that he gathered a Band of Men together, and made after them, spoiling their Lands more than any Foreign Enemy could have done; he spared neither Men, Houses, Cattle nor Corn, and That which he could not carry away, he spoiled, That so it might be rendred useless to the Owners. Thus he made a promiscous Havock of all things, (whether Sacred or Prophane) by Fire and Sword. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint hereof being made to <hi>Malcolm,</hi> who was then busie in helping the <hi>English</hi> against the <hi>Danes,</hi> he presently returned home; for he was incensed, not only at the undeserved Sufferings of so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny brave and innocent Persons, but much more, at the Indignity of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered him by <hi>Grimus</hi>; who, knowing that the Lands were shortly to pass over to another, without any Respect to future Times, had swept away the Fruits thereof, as if it had been an Enemies Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. There was a great Resort to <hi>Malcolm,</hi> at his return, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that, thÃ´ <hi>Grimus</hi> had for a time been Dear to, and Beloved of, the People; yet now the greatest part of the Nobles forsook him.

He followed this Counsel for some days, but, at last, when the <hi>Scots</hi> had got a full understanding of their Enemies Strength, they less diffided their Own; and both Armies, being equally pressed with Want, did unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously crave a Signal to the Battel, pretending, unless it were given, they would fall to it, even, without the Consent of their Generals.

And though the Victory did nominally rest on the <hi>Scots</hi> side, yet a great part of their Nobility being slain, and the rest, wearied and discouraged in their Spirits, returned to their Camp, giving the <hi>Danes</hi> liberty to retreat, without any pursuit; The next day, when both Parties mustered their Men, they found so great a Slaughter to have been made, that they willingly admitted some Priests to be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercessors of Peace between them.<note n="*" place="margin">Which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Peace between Them.</note> Whereupon, Peace was made on these Conditions, <hi>That the</hi> Danes <hi>should leave</hi> Murray, <hi>and</hi> Buchan, <hi>and depart; and that as long as</hi> Malcolm <hi>and</hi> Sueno <hi>lived, neither of them should wage War with one another any more, nor help one anothers Enemies; That the Field in which the Battel was fought, should be set apart, and Consecrated for the Burial of the Dead.</hi> Upon this, the <hi>Danes</hi> withdrew, and <hi>Malcolm</hi> took Order for the Interment of the slain.</p>
               <p>A while after, he called an Assembly of Estates at <hi>Scone</hi>; and, that he might reward those who had deserved well of their Country, he divided all the King's Lands between them: On the other side, the Nobility granted to the King, <note n="*" place="margin">The Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals of Ward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships.</note>
                  <q>That when any of them died, their Children should be under the Wardship and Tutelage of the King, till they arrived at the Age of 21 Years; and, that the King should receive all their Revenue, except what was expended for the Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Ward; And besides, that he should have the Power to give them in Marriage; Or, otherwise to dispose of them, when they were grown up, and should also receive their Dowry.</q>
I judge, this Custom came rather from the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Danes</hi>; because it yet continues throughout all <hi>England,</hi> and in part of <hi>Normandy,</hi> too. Afterwards, the King bent his Thoughts to repair the Damages su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stained by the War; he re-edified many Temples, and Sacred Places, demolished by the Enemy; he built New Castles, or else repaired the Old, in every Town. Having thus restored Peace to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom by his great Valour, he endeavoured further to adorn it with good Institutions and wholsom Laws; and, in order thereunto, be erected New Names for Magistrates, (I believe, such, as he borrowed from his Neighbours) which served rather for vain Ambition, than for any real Use. For, in former times, there was no Name superior in Honour to that of a <hi>Knight,</hi> except that of <hi>Thane, i. e.</hi> Governor, or Sheriff, of a Province or Country; which Custom, as I hear, is yet observed amongst the <hi>Danes.</hi> But, now a days, Princes keep no Mean, in instituting <note n="*" place="margin">New Titles of Honour.</note> New Names, or Titles, of Honour; though there be no use at all of those Names, but the bare Sound. Thus <hi>Malcolm,</hi> having finished his Toilsom Wars, Reigned some Years in great Splendor and Glory. But, in the Progress of his Age, he sullied the Beauty of his former Life with the blot of Covetousness. That Vice, being incident to Old Men, partly grew up in him with his Age, and partly arose from that Want, which his immoderate Largesses had driven him to. So that those Lands, which he had unadvisedly distributed amongst the Nobility, he did as unjustly and wickedly labour to resume; by which means, he put some of them to Death, and reduced others to great Penury. Hereupon, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent

sense of suffering, though sometimes just, drowned the Memory of all former Courtesies; so that, the Injury reaching to a few, but the Fear to many, the Friends and Kindred of those which were slain and impoverished, bent all their Thoughts to revenge Them, and to secure Themselves.

            <head>The Seventh BOOK.</head>
            <p>I Have declared in the former Book, how eagerly <hi>Kennethus,</hi> and his Son <hi>Malcolm,</hi> did strive, to settle the Succession to the Crown in their Families, <hi>That the Eldest Son might succeed the Father:</hi> But what the Success thereof, was, will appear in the Sequel. This is certain, That that Publick Benefit which was promised to the whole Kingdom, nor yet the private Advantage, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged to arise to our Kings, thereby, were not at all obtained, by this New Law. An Universal Good to All was pretended, in thus settling the Succession, that Seditions, Murders, and Treacheries, might be prevented amongst Those of the Blood; and also, that Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, with the other Mischiefs accompanying it, might be rooted out from amongst the Nobles. But, on the contrary,<note place="margin">Descants, by way of Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, upon the Law of <hi>Kenneth</hi> about Hereditary Succession to the Crown.</note> when I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the Causes of Publick Grievances, and compare the <hi>Old</hi> with the <hi>Modern,</hi> it seems to me, That all those Mischiefs, which we would have avoided by this New Law, are so far from being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished by the Antiquating of the Old, that they rather receive a great Increase therefrom. For, not to speak of the Plots of <hi>their</hi> Kinred against Those who are actually in the Throne; nor of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent King's Evil Suspitions of those, whom Nature and the Law would have accounted as most dear to him; I say, omitting these things, which, in the Series of our History, will be further explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; all the Miseries of former Ages may seem light and tolerable, if compared with those Calamities, which followed upon the Death of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Third. Neither will I insist upon the Particulars following, <hi>viz.</hi> that That Law doth enervate the Force of all Publick Councils, without which no Lawful Government can subsist: That it doth willingly, and, by consent, create those Evils to our selves, which others, who have Interest in Publick Governments, do chiefly, if not only, deprecate; <hi>viz.</hi> To have Kings, over whom other Governors must be appointed; and so the People are to be universally committed into their Power, who have no Power over themselves: insomuch, That those Persons, who are hardly brought to Obey Wise, Prudent, and Experienced Kings, are now required to yield Obedience, as it were, to the very shadow of a King; by which means, we willingly precipitate our selves into those Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which God threatens to Those, who despise and contemn his Holy Majesty, namely, That Children, Male or Female, may Reign over us, whom the Law of Nations, and even Nature it self, (the Mother of all Laws) hath subjected to the Rule of others. As for the private Benefit, That Kings aim at by this Law, <hi>i. e.</hi> That they may perpetuate their Name and Stock, how vain and fallaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous that Pretence is, the Examples of the Ancients, yea, even Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it self, might inform them, if they had but considered, by
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:56771:111"/>
how many Laws and Rewards, the <hi>Romans</hi> endeavoured to peren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate the mighty Names of their Families; of which yet, no one Footstep remains at this Day, no not in any part of the World, which they had Conquered. Which Disappointment doth deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly attend those, who fight against even Nature it self, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to cloath a fading, frail, Thing, subject to Momentany Alterations, and Blasts of Fortune, with a sort of Perpetuity; and to endow it with a kind of Eternity, which they themselves nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are Partakers of, nor can be; yea, they strive to effect it by those <hi>Mediums,</hi> which are most cross to their purpose: For, what is less conducive to Perpetuity, than Tyranny? Yet, this New Law makes a great Step thereto; for a Tyrant is, as it were, the <hi>White,</hi> or <hi>Mark,</hi> exposed to the Hate of all Men, insomuch that he cannot long subsist, and when he falls, all <hi>His</hi> fall with him. It seems to me, That God doth sometimes gently chastize and disappoint this endeavour of Foolish Men; and sometimes he doth expose it, even to Publick Scorn, as if it were emulous of his own Power. There can be no clearer, or fitter, Example of Gods Will and Pleasure, than That which we have now under our Hands. For <hi>Malcolm,</hi> who so much laboured to confirm the Law, (which was, almost, forcibly Enacted by his Father) by common Suffrage and Consent, <hi>For the Kings Children to be substituted in the Room of their deceased Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,</hi> even He, left no Male-Child behind him; but he had Two Daughters, One called <hi>Beatrix,</hi> whom he Married to a Nobleman named <hi>Grimus,</hi> the <hi>Thane</hi> of the Western Islands, and the Chief of all other <hi>Thanes,</hi> and therefore styled in that Age, <note n="*" place="margin">

                     <hi>Mackbeth</hi>'s Dream, encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging him to aspire to the Kingdom.</note> of which, one Saluted him, <hi>Thane</hi> of <hi>Angus</hi>; another, <hi>Thane</hi> of <hi>Murray</hi>; and a Third, King of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> His Mind, which was before Sick, betwixt Hope and Desire, was mightily encouraged by this Dream, so that he contrived all pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible ways, by which he might obtain the Kingdom; in order to which, a just occasion was offered him, as he thought. <hi>Duncan</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat Two Sons on the Daughter of <hi>Sibert,</hi> a petty King of <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland; Malcolm,</hi> Sirnamed <hi>Cammorus,</hi> (which is as much as <hi>Iolt-head,</hi>) and <hi>Donaldus,</hi> Sirnamed <hi>Banus,</hi> i. e. <hi>White:</hi> Of these, he made <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colm,</hi> scarce yet out of his Childhood, Governor of <hi>Cumberland. Mackbeth</hi> took this matter mighty Hainously; in regard, he look'd upon it as Obstacle of Delay to him, in his obtaining the Kingdom; for, having arrived at the Enjoyment of his other Honours, promised him by his Dream; by this means, he thought, that either he should be secluded altogether from the Kingdom; or else, should be much retarded in the Enjoyment thereof; in regard the Government of <hi>Cumberland</hi> was always look'd upon, as the first step to the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland.</hi> Besides, his Mind, which was feirce enough of it self, was spurred on, by the daily Importunities of his Wife, (who was Privy to all his Counsels.) Whereupon, communicating the matter to his most intimate Friends, amongst whom <hi>Bancho</hi> was one, he got a fit opportunity, at <hi>Innerness,</hi> to way-lay the King, and so slew him in the Seventh year of his Reign; and gathering a Company toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, went to <hi>Scone,</hi> and under the shelter of popular Favour, made himself King.<note n="*" place="margin">He thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on sl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>MAckbeth,</hi> to confirm the ill-gotten Kingdom to himself, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured the favour of the Nobles by great Gifts, being secure of the Kings Children because of their Age, and of his Neighbouring Princes, in regard of their mutual Animosities, and Discords. Thus having engaged the great Men, he determined to procure the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Vulgar by Justice and Equity<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and to retain it by Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, if nothing else would do. Whereupon, he determined with himself to punish the Free-booters or Thieves,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mackbeth</hi> se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere against Thieves.</note> who had taken cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage from the Lenity of <hi>Duncan</hi>; but, foreseeing, that this could not be done without great Tumults and much ado, he devised this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, which was, to sow the Seeds of Discord amongst them, by some fit Men, for that purpose, that thereupon they might challenge one another; and so, some of them might fight in equal and divided Numbers, one with another. All this was to be done on one and the same day, and that in the most remote parts of <hi>Scotland,</hi> too; when they all met at the time appointed, they were taken by an Ambush, which he had laid for that purpose. Their Punishment strook a Terrour into the rest. Besides, he put to death the <hi>Thanes</hi> of <hi>Caithnes, Ross, Sutherland,</hi> and <hi>Narn,</hi> and some others of the Clans, by whose Fewds the Commonalty were miserably harassed, before. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, he went into the <hi>Aebudae</hi> Islands, and used severe Justice there. After his return from thence, he once or twice summoned <hi>Macgill</hi> or <hi>Macgild,</hi> the powerfullest Man in all <hi>Galway,</hi> to appear, but he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused so to do, rather out of fear for being of <hi>Malcolm</hi>'s Faction, than for the guilt of the Crimes objected to him; whereupon, he sent Forces against him, who overthrew him in Battel, and cut off his Head.</p>
               <p>The publick Peace being thus restored, he applied his mind to make Laws, (a thing almost wholly neglected by former Kings) and indeed, he Enacted many good and useful ones,<note place="margin">He makes Wholesom Laws.</note> which now are either wholly unknown, or else lie unobserved, to the great damage of the Publick. In a word, he so managed the Government for ten years, that, if he had not obtained it by Violence, he might have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted inferior to none of the former Kings. But when he had so strengthned himself with the Aid and Favour of the Multitude, that he feared no Force to disturb him; the Murder of the King (as 'tis very probable) hurried his Mind into dangerous Precipices, so that he converted his Government, got by Treachery, into a Cruel Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny. He vented the first Shock of his Inhumanity upon <note place="margin">But<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> afterward<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> degenerates, &amp; causes <hi>Bancho</hi> to be treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously slain.</note> 
                  <hi>Bancho,</hi> who was his Companion in the Kings Parricide. Some ill Men had spread a kind of Prophecie abroad among the Vulgar, <hi>That hereafter his Posterity should enjoy the Kingdom</hi>; whereupon, fearing lest he, being a powerful and active Man, and also of the Blood Royal, should imitate the Example proposed by himself, he courteously invited him and his Son to Supper, but, in his return, he caused him to be slain, as if a sudden Fray and Tumult had arisen. His Son <hi>Fleanchus,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not known in the dark, escaped the Ambush, and, being inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his Friends, how his Father was treacherously slain by the
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:56771:114"/>
King, and that his Life was also sought after, he fled secretly into <hi>Wales.</hi> Upon that Murder, so cruelly and perfidiously committed, the Nobles were afraid of themselves, insomuch, that they all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted to their own homes, and came but few of them, and those very seldom, to Court. So that the Kings Cruelty being partly disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by some, and partly vehemently suspected by all, mutual Fear and Hatred sprung up betwixt him and the Nobility. Whereupon, seeing the matter could no longer be concealed, he broke forth into open Tyranny, and the Rich and Powerful for light, frivolous, and, many times, but pretended, Causes, were put to Death. Their Confiscated Goods helped to maintain a Band of <hi>Debauchees,</hi> which he had about him under the name of a Guard. And yet, he thought, that his Life was not sufficiently secured by them neither, so that he resolved to build a Castle on the top of the Hill <note n="*" place="margin">Lying South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>west, 3 miles from <hi>Cowper</hi> in <hi>Angus.</hi>

At that time, <hi>Mack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duff</hi> was the <hi>Thane</hi> of <hi>Fife,</hi> a very powerful Man in his Country; He, being loth to commit his Life unto the Kings hands, went not himself, but sent thither many Workmen, and some of them his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate Friends, to press on the Work. The King, either out of a desire (as was pretended) to see how the Building proceeded, or else to apprehend <hi>Mackduff,</hi> (as he himself feared) came to view the Structure, and by chance spying a Teem of <hi>Mackduff</hi>'s Oxen, not able to draw up their Load against a steep Hill, he took thence a willing occasion to vent his Passion against the <hi>Thane,</hi> saying, <hi>That he knew well enough, before, his disobedient Temper, and therefore, was resolved to punish it; and, to make him an Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>

                  <hi>he threatened to lay the Yoke upon his own Neck, instead of his Oxen. Maecduff,</hi> hearing of it, commended the Care of his Family to his Wife, and, without any delay, fitted up a small Vessel, as well as the streights of Time permitted, and so passed over into <hi>Lothian,</hi> and from thence into <hi>England.</hi> The King hearing, that he intended to fly,<note place="margin">He flies into <hi>England.</hi>
                  </note> made haste into <hi>Fife,</hi> with a strong Band of Men to prevent him; but, he being departed before, the King was presently admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into his Castle, where he poured out all his Fury upon the <hi>Thane's</hi> Wife and Children, who were there present. His Goods were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiscated, He himsel was proclaimed Traitor, and a grievous Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was threatened to any, who dared to converse with, or enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, him. He exercised also great Cruelty against others, if they were either Noble or Rich, without distinction. For now the Nobility was despised by him, and he managed the Government by Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick Counsels. In the mean time, <hi>Macduff,</hi> arriving in <hi>England,</hi> found <hi>Malcolm</hi> there, Royally Treated by King <hi>Edward.</hi> For <hi>Edward,</hi> when the <hi>Danes</hi> Power was broken in <hi>England,</hi> being recalled from Banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, did favour <hi>Malcolm,</hi> who was brought to him by <hi>Sibert,</hi> (his Grandfather by the Mother side) for many Reasons, as, either, because his Father and Grandfather,<note place="margin">And stirs up <hi>Malcolm, Duncan</hi>'s Son, against him.</note> when Governors of <hi>Cumberland,</hi> had always favoured the Concerns of his Ancestors, as much as the Times

would permit them to do; or else, because the <hi>Similitude of Events, and the remembrance of Dangers, did assimilate their Minds,</hi> for each King had been unjustly banished by Tyrants; Or, Lastly, because <hi>the Affliction of Kings doth conciliate and move the Minds, even of the greatest strangers, to pity and favour them.</hi> Whereupon, the <hi>Thane,</hi> as soon as he had opportunity to speak with <hi>Malcolm,</hi> in a long Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course declared to him the Necessity of his unhappy Flight, the Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty of <hi>Mackbeth</hi> against all ranks of Men, with the universal Hatred of the People, conceived against him; so that he advised him, in an accurate Harangue, as he was a Son, so to endeavour the Recovery of his Fathers Kingdom, especially, seeing he could not, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring a great deal of Guilt, leave the Murder of his Father, to pass unrevenged; nor, neglect the Miseries of the People, which God had committed to his Charge; nor finally, ought He to shut his Ears, against the just Petitions of his Friends. Besides, he told him, That King <hi>Edward</hi> was so Gracious a Prince, That he would not be wanting to him, his Friend, and Suppliant; That the People did also favour Him and hated the Tyrant; In fine, <hi>That Gods Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour would attend the Good, against the Impious, if he were not wanting to himself.</hi> But <hi>Malc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<q>I know (says he) That all what thou hast said is true; but I am afraid That you, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite Me to undertake the Regal Government, do not throughly know my Disposition; for those Vices, which have already destroyed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Kings, <hi>viz.</hi> Lust, and Avarice, do almost Reign, even in me, too; and thÃ´ now, my private Fortune doth hide and disguise them, yet the Liberty of a Kingdom will let loose the Reins thereunto; And therefore, said he, Pray, have a care, that you invite me not, rather to my Ruin, than to a Throne: When <hi>Mackduff</hi> had reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereto, That the Lust and Desire of many Concubines might be prevented by a lawful Marriage; and that Avarice might be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so bounded and forborn, when the fear of Penury (as it must be upon a Throne) is removed: <hi>Malcolm</hi> subjoyned, That he had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther now make an ingenious Confession to him, as his Friend, than to be found guilty hereafter, to the great damage of them both; For my Self, to deal plainly with you, said he, There is no Truth nor Sincerity in me, I confide in no Body living, but I change my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs and Counsels, upon every blast of Suspition; and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Whereupon, <hi>Mackduff</hi> replyed,
<q>Avant, says he, Thou Disgrace and Prodigy of the Royal Name and Stock, worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to be sent into the remotest Desert, than to be called to a Throne;</q> and, in a great Anger, he was about to fling away.
Then <hi>Malcolm</hi> took him by the hand, and declared the Cause of this his Dissimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to him, telling him, That he had been so often assaulted by the Wiles of <hi>Mackbeth,</hi> that he did not dare, lightly, to trust every body. But now he saw no Cause to suspect any Fraud in <hi>Macduff,</hi> in respect either of his Lineage, his Manners, Fame, nor Fortune.</p>

There they were Royally Educated and so much grateful Toward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness appeared in <hi>Edward,</hi> that <hi>Salomon</hi> culled him out of all the Young Nobles, to give him his Daughter <hi>Agatha</hi> to Wife.

He, being desirous to transfer the Kingdom into his own Family, caused <hi>Alured</hi> to be Poysoned; as for <hi>Edward,</hi> he was preserved, rather by Gods Providence, than by any human Counsel, and Reigned most devoutly in <hi>England.</hi> But, wanting Children, his Chief care was, to recal his Kinsman out of <hi>Hungary</hi> to undertake the Government, alleging, That when <hi>Edgar</hi> returned, he would willingly surrender up All to him; but His Modesty out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did the Kings Piety; for he refused to accept of the Kingdom, as long as he was alive.</p>
               <p>At length, upon <hi>Edwards</hi> death, <hi>Harald, Godwyns</hi> Son, invaded the Throne, yet he dealt kindly with <hi>Agatha,</hi> the <hi>Hungarian,</hi> and her Children.

                  <hi>Malcolm</hi> looked upon it as a cruel and faithless Thing, to deliver up his Suppliants Guest and Kinsman (and one, against whom his very Enemies could object no Crime) to his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital Enemy to be put to Death, and therefore resolved to suffer any thing, rather than so to do. And thereupon he not only detained, and harboured, <hi>Edgar,</hi> but also gave Admission to his Friends, who, in great Numbers, were Banished from their own homes, and gave them Lands to live upon; whose Posteritys were there Propagated into many Rich and Opulent Families. Upon this Occasion, there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed a War betwixt the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>English,</hi> wherein <hi>Sibert,</hi> King of <hi>Northumberland</hi> favouring <hi>Edgar,</hi> joyned his Forces with the <hi>Scots.</hi> The <hi>Norman,</hi> being puff'd up with the good Success of his Affairs, made light of the <hi>Scotish</hi> War, and thinking to end it in a short time, he sent one <hi>Roger,</hi> a Nobleman of his own Country, with Forces into <hi>Northumberland.</hi> But he, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing overcome and put to flight, was at last Slain by his own Men.</p>

The Matter being discovered to him, he pursued the Conspirators, unto the furthest part of <hi>Ross:</hi> When they came to the River <hi>Spey,</hi> they thought to stop the Kings Pursuit, by reason of the Rapidness of the River; and besides, the Kings Friends would not suffer him to enter the River, because the Tide coming in,<note place="margin">

But his own Men (as I said) drew him back, so that he sent over Part of his Army, under the Command of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Carron,</hi> the Son of that <hi>Alexander,</hi> I mentioned before, whose

Miraculous Boldness, in passing the River with his Forces, struck such a Terrour into the Enemy, that they presently betook them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to their Heels.

Afterwards, he turned his Thoughts to the Works of Peace; he built <hi>Michael</hi>'s <hi>Church</hi> in <hi>Scone,</hi> from the very Ground: The College of Priests, which was there, he turned into a Monastery for <hi>Monks.</hi> Being once carried by Tempest into the Isle <note n="*" place="margin">

                  <hi>Stephen</hi> Earl of <hi>Bologne,</hi> in this want of Royal Issue, took heart to attempt the Crown of <hi>England</hi>: Neither did he look upon it as a Design of any great Difficulty, both by reason of the Weakness of the adverse Party, and also, because he himself had some Royal Blood running in his Veins: For he was born of a Daughter of <hi>William</hi> the <hi>Norman,</hi> which had Married the Earl of <hi>Bloys.</hi> He himself had also Married <hi>Maud,</hi> Daughter of the former Earl of <hi>Bologne,</hi> and Cousin-German to <hi>Maud</hi> the Empress, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten upon <hi>Mary,</hi> Sister to <hi>David,</hi> King of <hi>Scotland</hi>: <note n="*" place="margin">His Pretensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> Upon the Confidence of so great Alliances, by reason of the absence of <hi>Maud</hi> the Queen, and the Sickness of <hi>Geoffry,</hi> he thought he might easily obtain the Crown of <hi>England.</hi> And to make his Way clearer, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Conscience or Regard of his Oath, which he and th'other kindred had taken to Queen <hi>Maud,</hi> he drew in, by great Promises, the <note place="margin">The Bishops of <hi>England</hi> not True to <hi>Maud,</hi> according to their Oaths.</note> Bishops of <hi>England,</hi> who had also taken the same Oath, into his Unlawful design; and, especially, <hi>William,</hi> Arch-Bishop of <hi>York,</hi> who was the first that Swore Allegiance to Queen <hi>Maud,</hi> and <hi>Roger</hi> Bishop of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> who had not only taken the Oath himself, but had also read the Words of it to the other Nobles, when they Swore.</p>
               <p>Upon this Confidence, even before his Uncle <hi>Henry</hi> was buried, he stept into the Throne, and the Two First Years reigned peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly enough: Whereupon, growing insolent, he began to neglect his Agreement made with the <hi>English</hi>; and also to deal harsly with strangers. After he had compelled all the <hi>English,</hi> partly by Fear, partly by fair Promises, to take an Oath of Allegiance to him, he sent Embassadors to <hi>David,</hi> King of <hi>Scots,</hi> to put him in mind, to take the same Oath, for the Counties of <hi>Cumberland, Northumberland,</hi> and <hi>Huntingdon,</hi> which he held of him. <note place="margin">

                  <hi>David</hi> returned Answer, That he, together with <hi>Stephen</hi> himself, and the other Nobles of <hi>England,</hi> had, not long since, bound themselves, by an Oath, to obey <hi>Maud,</hi> their Lawful Queen; And that he ought not, nor would, acknowledge any other King, as long as she was alive: When this Answer was brought to <hi>Stephen,</hi> presently a War began. The <hi>English</hi> entred upon the adjacent <hi>Scots;</hi> the <hi>Scots</hi> doing as much for them.

                  </note> 
                  <hi>English,</hi> being overthrown, many perished in the flight, and many of the Nobility were taken Prisoners, amongst whom was the Earl of <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester,</hi> himself; <hi>Stephen,</hi> being much concerned at this Overthrow, lest the Friends and Kindred of the Captive Nobles might be alienated from him, refused no Conditions of Peace. The Terms were These,
<q>That the <hi>English</hi> Prisoners should be released without Ransom:<note place="margin">An Agreement between <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Stephen</hi> not observed.</note> That <hi>Stephen</hi> should quit all the Claim, which, as chief Lord, he pretended to have over <hi>Cumberland.</hi>
                  </q>
But <hi>Stephen</hi> observed those Conditions, no better than he did the Oath, formerly taken, to <hi>Maud,</hi> his Kinswoman: For, before the Armies were quite Disbanded, and the Prisoners Released, he privately surprized some Castles in <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland</hi>; and, by driving away Bootys from the <hi>Scots</hi> Countrys, renewed the War. The <hi>Scots,</hi> gathering a sudden Army together out of the Neighbour Countrys, and despising the <hi>English,</hi> whom they had overthrown in Battel, the self same Year, did rashly run on to the Conflict at the River <note place="margin">Which hath its Source near <hi>Black-Laws</hi> in <hi>Teesdale.</hi> The <hi>Scots</hi> overthrown by <hi>Stephen.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Tees</hi>; where they paid for their Folly, in undervaluing the Enemy, by receiving a great Overthrow; and were also enforced to quit <hi>Northumberland: David,</hi> to retrieve this Loss and Ignominy, gathered as great an Army, as ever he could, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and came to <hi>Roxburgh</hi>: Thither <hi>Turstan,</hi> or (as <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Newberry</hi> calls him) <hi>Trustinus,</hi> was sent, by the <hi>English,</hi> to Treat concerning a Pacification, and, there being some hope of Agreement, a Truce was made for Three Months, upon Condition,
<q>That <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland</hi> should be presently restored to the <hi>Scots:</hi>
                  </q>
But this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, which was made by <hi>Stephen,</hi> only to have the Army Disbanded, was not performed; so that <hi>David</hi> drove away a great Booty, out of that Part of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> which obeyed <hi>Stephen</hi>; and <hi>Stephen,</hi> gathering a great Force together, pierced as far as <hi>Roxborough</hi>: But, understanding, That the Nobility were averse, and complained, That they were intangled in an Unjust and Unnecessary War, without performing any Memorable Exploit, he retired into the heart of his Kingdom: And, the next Year, fearing some intestine Sedition, he sent his Wife <hi>Maud</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> her Uncle, to treat of Peace. Upon her Mediation, it was accorded, That <hi>David,</hi> from <hi>Newcastle,</hi> where he commonly aboad; and <hi>Stephen,</hi> from <hi>Durham,</hi> should send Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trators for composing of Matters, to the Town of <hi>Chester in the street,</hi> scituate in the Midway, equally distant, from Both Places. <hi>David</hi> sent the Arch-Bishops of St. <hi>Andrews</hi> and <hi>Glasgoe; Stephen,</hi> the Arch-Bishops of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and <hi>York</hi>: Both Parties were the more inclineable to Peace, because <hi>Stephen</hi> feared War from abroad, and Seditions at home; and the <hi>Scots</hi> complained, That they were forced to bear the shock of a War, made in the behalf of another; whereas <hi>Maud,</hi> for whose sake it was commenced, did nothing at all in it. The Peace was made on These Conditions,
<q>That <hi>Cumberland,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Another Agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Stephen</hi> King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                     </note> as by Ancient Right, should be possessed by <hi>David,</hi> and that <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland</hi> unto the River <hi>Tees,</hi> (as <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Newberry,</hi> the <hi>Englishman,</hi> writes) and <hi>Huntingtonshire,</hi> should be enjoyed by <hi>Henry, Davids</hi> Son, upon the account of his Mothers Inheritance;
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:56771:122"/>
and, That he should do Homage to <hi>Stephen,</hi> for the same.</q>
When things were thus composed, <hi>David</hi> retired into <hi>Cumberland,</hi> and <hi>Stephen</hi> into <hi>Kent.</hi> This Peace was made in the Year of our Lord 1139. In which Year, <hi>Maud,</hi> being returned into <hi>England,</hi> sent her Son <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Henry,</hi> Heir of <hi>England,</hi> sent to <hi>David</hi> his Uncle, to be made Knight by him.</note> 
                  <hi>Henry,</hi> afterward King of <hi>England,</hi> to <hi>Carlisle,</hi> to <hi>David</hi> his Great Uncle, that he might be instructed in Feats of Arms, and also be made Knight, by him; who, without doubt was the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellentest Warrior in his time; which Matter, in those days, was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed with a great deal of Ceremony.</p>
               <p>At that time, there was so great a Disturbance in <hi>England,</hi> by reason of Domestique Discords, That no Part of it was free from a Civil War, but That which <hi>David</hi> the King of <hi>Scots</hi> held. And, that he alone might not plead Exemption from the publick Calamity; within Three Years after, his Son, the only Heir (in hope) of so much Power and Felicity,<note n="*" place="margin">King <hi>David</hi> loses his hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Son and Heir.</note> dyed in the flower of his Age, leaving Three Sons, and as many Daughters behind him. He left so great a Love behind for him, both from the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>English</hi>; that, besides the publick Loss, every one lamented his own private Misfortune al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, at his death: For so great a Sincerity, and Moderation of Mind, shined forth in him, even in that Age, wherein Youth is accustom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to wantonize, That every body expected most rare and singular Fruits from his Disposition, when it was ripened by Age. His Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Grief was also further increased, by reason of the tender Age of his Nephew, and the Ambition, and restless Disposition, of <hi>Stephen,</hi> and if he dyed, he was troubled at the Fierceness of <hi>Henry</hi>'s Spirit, then in the fervor of his Youth; who, being the Son of <hi>Maud,</hi> was to succeed in the Kingdom. When the Thoughts of so many fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen Mischiefs did assault his diseased and feeble Mind, insomuch, that all Men imagined, he would have sunk under them, yet he bore up so stoutly, that he invited some of the Prime Nobility (who were solicitous for him, lest he should be too much afflicted, as well they might) to Supper, and there he entertained them with a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, rather like a <hi>Comforter</hi> than a <hi>Mourner,</hi> He told them. <note n="*" place="margin">But <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This Greatness of Mind in the King, as it added much to his own Veneration, so it increased the Sense of the loss of his Son, in the Minds of all; when they considered, What a Prince they and their Children were deprived of.

When <hi>Iohn,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Glascow,</hi> was Dedicating Churches, Shaving Priests, and performing the other Parts of his Episcopal Office, (as then they were judged to be) all over <hi>Cumberland.

Iohn</hi> was so moved at the Injury, that, seeing no sufficient Safeguard, neither in the King, nor in the Law, he left his Bishoprick, and retired into the Monastery of <hi>Tours,</hi> in <hi>France.</hi> Whence he returned not, untill the Pope, at <hi>Malcolm</hi> his Request, drew him unwillingly out of his Cell, and made him return to his own Country: <hi>Malcolm</hi> bore the wrong better, than some hoped; so that, not thinking it a sufficient Cause for a War, he went to <hi>Chester in the Street,</hi> there to quiet Suspicions, and to cut off occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of Discord.

For, he sent for him to <hi>London,</hi> That, according to the Examples of his Ancestors, he, in a publick Assembly, might acknowledge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self his Feudatary, for the Lands which he held in <hi>England.</hi> He, under Covert of the Publick Faith, came speedily thither, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

doing any thing of That, for which his Journey was pretended, he was inforced, against his Will, with that little Retinue, which he had, to accompany <hi>Henry</hi> into <hi>France: Henry</hi>'s Design herein, was, partly, that the <hi>Scots</hi> might not attempt any thing against him in his absence; and partly, to alienate the Mind of <hi>Lewis,</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi>

Thus, <hi>Malcolm</hi> was compelled, for fear of a greater Mischief, to go against his old Friend, and was not suffered to come back to his own Country; till King <hi>Henry,</hi> having made no great Earnings of the <hi>French</hi> War, returned home also. Then <hi>Malcolm</hi> obtained leave to return to <hi>Scotland</hi>; where, in a Convention of the Nobility, he declared to them the Adventure of his Travels; but, he found a great Part of them very much incensed, that he had joyned with a <hi>certain</hi> Enemy, against an Old and Trusty Friend; and did not foresee the Artifices, by which <hi>Henry</hi> had gulled him. The King, on the other side, alleged, That he was haled unwillingly into <hi>France,</hi> by a King, in whose Power he was, and to whom he dared to deny nothing, at that time; and therefore, he did not despair, but the <hi>French</hi> would be satisfied and appeased, when they understood, he was hurried thither by Force, and carried none of his Country Forces along with him. This Harangue, with much ado, quieted the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition for the present, which was almost ready to break out.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Henry,</hi> who had Spies every where, knew, That the Tumult was rather suspended, than that the Minds of Men were reconciled to him; and therefore, he Summoned <hi>Malcolm</hi> to come to a Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at <hi>York.</hi> There he was accused of a pretended Crime, That the <hi>English</hi> had been worsted in <hi>France,</hi> principally by his means; and therefore, it was referred to the Assembly,<note place="margin">And at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, despoils him of his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in <hi>England.</hi>

At which, his Subjects, the <hi>Scots,</hi> were so incensed, that at his Return home, they besieged him in <hi>Perth,</hi> and had almost taken him. But, by the Intervention of some great Men, their Anger was somewhat abated, when he had informed the Nobility, how unjust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and fraudulently, <hi>Henry</hi> had despoiled him of his Ancient Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony.

                  </note> War, that so he might recover by just Arms, what was unlawfully taken from him by Force. Thus a War was Decreed, Denounc'd, and Waged, not without great Inconveniencies to both Nations.

                  <hi>Henry</hi> took away <hi>Northumberland</hi> from <hi>Malcolm,</hi> leaving him <hi>Cumberland,</hi> and <hi>Huntington-shire; Henry</hi> had no other Pretence for his Ambitious Avarice, but This, That he could not suffer so great a Diminution to be made of his Kingdom. But, seeing no respect to Justice, and Right, no Pacts, Covenants, no, nor the Religion of an Oath, could hinder the unsatiable Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice of <hi>Henry; Malcolm,</hi> being a Man of a low Spirit, and too desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous

of Peace, upon any Conditions whatever, accepted of his Terms, sore against the Minds of the <hi>Scots</hi> Nobility; who denied, <hi>That the King could alienate any part of his Dominions, without the General Consent of the Estates.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After this, the King began to be despised by his Subjects, as not having Fortitude, or Prudence, enough, to weild the Scepter; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did any thing bridle their fierce Minds, from Rising in Arms, but a greater Fear from <hi>Henry</hi>; who (they knew) did aim at the Conquest of the whole Island, being encouraged thereunto, by the Simplicity of <hi>Malcolm,</hi> and by his Hopes of Foreign Aid. This Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Disaffection to the King did much lessen the Reverence of his Government. A Rebellion was first begun by <hi>Angus,</hi> or rather, <hi>Aeneas,</hi> of <hi>Galway,</hi> a Potent Man, but yet more encouraged by the Kings Sloth, than his own Power. <hi>Gilchrist</hi> was sent against him; who overthrew him in Three Fights, and compelled him to take Sanctuary in the Monastery of <hi>White-horn,</hi>

But, he being of a lofty Spirit, and not able to endure this abatement of his former Greatness, turn'd Monk, shaved himself, and shut himself up in a Monastery near <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> to avoid the shame and scorn of Men.

When Right was claimed by the Wardens of the Marches, according to Custom, the <hi>English</hi> complained, That their Borders were molested by <hi>Scotish</hi> Robbers; so that the Ambassadors were sent away, without obtaining the thing they came for; yea, almost without an Answer: The <hi>Scots,</hi> to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that by Force, which they could not do by fair means, levied an Army, and entred upon, and wasted, the bordering Lands of the <hi>English,</hi> with Fire and Sword.

About the same time, the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> was restored to the <hi>Scots</hi>; one of the Pensions having been paid, and to make the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord between Both Kings more firm; a Law was made, <hi>That neither King should harbour the Enemy of each other.</hi> Upon this Law, <hi>Gilchrist,</hi> who lived Banished in <hi>England,</hi> was forced to return, and, shifting from place to place,<note place="margin">But is Forced to return into his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</note> as a Stranger, amongst Strangers, and unknown, he passed his Miserable Life, in great Penury and Want.

William,</hi> having, in vain, complained of the Injurie, by his Embassadors, gathered a Company together, and demolished what was built thereof.

into an unexpected Danger; The greatest Part of the Town of <hi>Berth</hi> was swept away in the Night, by an Inundation of the River <hi>Tay</hi>; Neither was the King's Palace exempted from the Calamity, but his Son, an Infant, with his Nurse, and 14 more, were drowned, the rest hardly escaping.

This was in a manner, the last memorable Fact of <hi>William</hi>'s, which yet, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his unweildy Age, was acted by his Captains.

               <p>Not long before his Death, Leagues were renewed with <hi>Iohn</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> almost every Year; for he, being a Man desirous to enlarge his Dominions, thÃ´ he had War with the <hi>French</hi> abroad, with the <hi>Romanists</hi> at home, and moreover, was never on sure Terms of Peace with the <hi>Irish</hi> or <hi>Welsh</hi>; yet, did not break off his Inclination to invade <hi>Scotland,</hi> which had then an old Man for their King, and the next Heir to him, a Child. Frequent Conferences happened on this Occasion, rather to try what might be obtained, than in hopes of any good Issue; at length, the Matter broke out into open Suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion; And, after many Leagues made between Them, at last <hi>William</hi> was called to <hi>Newcastle</hi> upon <hi>Tine,</hi> Whither he came, but there, fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into a dangerous Disease, he returned without doing any thing. In fine, a little before his Death, he was invited to <hi>Norham</hi> on the <hi>Tweed,</hi> and when his Sickness would not permit him to go, his Son was desired to come in his stead, which, yet, by the Advice of the Council, was refused; the Leagues, established in those Interviews, I shall not particularly mention, for they, almost all, contain the same things, having in them nothing New, save that in One of them it was Articled,<note n="*" place="margin">Several Leagues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Scotland.</hi>

He divided the Kingdom into Four Parts, and, almost every year, he Travelled them all over, staying well near Three Months in each of them, to do Justice; and to hear the complaints of the Poor, who had free Access to him, all that time. Assoon as he went to an Assize or Sessions, he Commanded the Prefect, or Sheriff, of that Precinct, to meet him with a select number of Men, and also to accompany him at his departure to the end of his Bailywick, till the next Precinct, where he was Guarded by another like Company. By this means, he became acquainted with all the Nobility, and was as well known to them; and the People, as he went, were not burthen'd with a Troop of Courtiers, who are commonly Imperious, and given to Avarice, where they come.<note place="margin">Idle Persons punished.</note> He commanded the Magistrates to punish all Idle Persons, who followed no Trade, nor had any Estates to maintain them; for his Opinion was, <hi>That Idleness was the Source and Fountain of all Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness.</hi> He reduced the Horse-Train of the Nobles, when they tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled, to a certain number; because, he thought, that the Multitude of Horses, which were unfit for War, would spend too much Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.

That Order lasted about an Year; but being accounted by many, of a publick Prejudice, at length, so great a Quantity of Foreign Commodities were imported, that, in <hi>Scotland,</hi> they were never in the Memory of Man, more, or less cheap: In this Case, that he might study the good of the Merchants-Company, he forbad, that any but Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants should buy what was imported, by whole Sale; but what every Man wanted, he was to buy it at second Hand, or by Retail, from them.</p>

            <p>The Embassadors, in the Session, discoursed much of the publick Utility, like to accrue to both Kingdoms, by this Marriage; neither did they find the <hi>Scots</hi> averse therefrom. For <hi>Edward</hi> was a Man of great Courage, and Power, yet he desired to increase it; and his Valour highly appeared in the <hi>Holy War,</hi> in his Fathers Life time, and, after his Death, in his subduing of <hi>Wales</hi>; neither were there ever more Endearments passed betwixt the <hi>Scots</hi> and the <hi>English,</hi> than under the last Kings; Yea, the Ancient Hatred seemed no way more likely to be abolished, than if both Nations, on Just and Equal Terms, might be united into One.</p>
            <p>For these Reasons, the Marriage was easily assented to; other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions were also added, by the consent of both Parties; as, That the <hi>Scots</hi> should use their own Laws and Magistrates, until Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were begot out of that Marriage, which might Govern the Kingdom; or, if no such were begot, or being born, if they dyed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they came to the Crown; then the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> was to pass to the next Kinsman of the Blood-Royal. Matters being thus setled, Embassadors were sent into <hi>Norway.

Being come thither, his Age, Beauty, Kindred, and Manners, easily procuring mutual Love, they were quickly Married, in a private way. When the King was informed thereof, he was much offended with them Both, because the Right of bestowing the Lady in Marriage, lay in him; yet, by the Mediation of Friends, he was afterwards Reconciled to them.

            <p>Thus having enlarged my self in this Prologue, I come now to the Matter in Hand, and to the Competitors of the Kingdom: They
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:56771:133"/>
were, <hi>Dornadilla,</hi> the Grand-child of <hi>David</hi> of <hi>Huntingdon,</hi> by his Eldest Daughter; and <hi>Robert Bruce,</hi> Earl of <hi>Carrick,</hi> Grand-son of the said <hi>David,</hi> by his youngest Daughter. <hi>Dornadilla</hi>'s Pretensions were grounded on the Custom of the Country; whereby, he, or she, that was nearer in Degree,<note place="margin">The several Pretensions of the Competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to the Crown.</note> had a better Right: <hi>Robert Bruce</hi> insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted on the Sex; that, in a like degree of Propinquity, <hi>Males</hi> ought to be preferred before <hi>Females</hi>; so that he denied it to be just, that as long as a Grand-son was alive, a Grand-daughter should inherit her Ancestors Estate. And though sometimes the contrary may be practised in the Inheritances of private Men; yet, the matter is far otherwise in those Estates, which are called <hi>Feuds,</hi> and in the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of Kingdoms. And of this, there was urged a late Example in the Controversie, concerning the Dutchess of <hi>Burgundy</hi>; which, the Earl of <hi>Nevers,</hi> who Married the Grand-child of the last Duke, by his Eldest Son, Claimed; yet, the Inheritance was adjudged to the Son of the Duke's younger Brother; so that <hi>Robert</hi> contended, That he was nearer in Degree, as being a Grand-son, than <hi>Iohn Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liol,</hi> who was but a Great Grand-son: As for <hi>Dornadilla,</hi> with whom he stood in equal Degree; yet, he was to be preferred before her, as a <hi>Male</hi> before a <hi>Female.</hi>

               <note place="margin">Which diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence could not be decided by the <hi>Scots.</hi>
               </note>The <hi>Scots</hi> Nobles could not decide this Controversie at home; for, by reason of the Power of both Parties, the Land was divided into Two Factions. For <hi>Baliol,</hi> by his Mother, held all <hi>Galway,</hi> a very large Country; and besides, he was allied to the <hi>Cumin</hi>'s Family, which was the most Powerful, next the Kings; for <hi>Mary,</hi> the Sister of <hi>Dornadilla,</hi> had Married <hi>Iohn Cumins. Robert,</hi> on the other side, in <hi>England,</hi> possessed <hi>Cleveland</hi>; in <hi>Scotland, Annandale,</hi> and <hi>Garioch</hi>; and by his Son, Earl of <hi>Carrick,</hi> (who was afterwards King) was related to many Noble Families, and he was also very Gracious with his own People; so that for these Reasons, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie was not able to be decided at home; yea, if it should have been equitably determined, yet, there was not a sufficient Party in <hi>Scotland</hi> to compel both sides to stand to the Award;<note place="margin">But was refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirage of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </note> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Edward</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> was, almost, unanimously chosen to be the Decider thereof. Neither was there any doubt made of his Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, as being Born of such a Father, as the late King of <hi>Scotland</hi> had Experienced to be, both a Loving Father in Law, to him, and a just Guardian, too; and on the contrary the <hi>English</hi> King had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a late and memorable Testimony of the <hi>Scots</hi> Good-Will towards him, in that they so readily consented to the Marriage of his Son with their Queen.</p>
            <p>Whereupon, <hi>Edward,</hi> as soon as he came to <hi>Berwick,</hi> sent Letters to the Peers and Governors of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to come to him, protesting, That he Summoned them to appear before him, not as Subjects before their Lord or Supreme Magistrate, but as Friends before an Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trator, chosen by themselves. First of all, he required an Oath of the Competitors, to stand to his Award; in the next place, he required the same Oath of the Nobles and Commissioners to obey Him, as King, whom he, upon his Oath, should declare so to be; and for this, he desired a publick Scrol, or Record, signed by all the States, and each ones Seal affixed thereto, to be given to him. This being
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:56771:133"/>
done, he chose, of the most prudent of all the Estates, 12 <hi>English,</hi> and adjoyned 12 <hi>Scots</hi> to them, from them also he exacted an Oath, to Judge Rightly and Truly, according to their Consciences, in the Case. These things were managed openly and above board, which, in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, were honest and taking with the People, but his private Design was secretly agitated amongst a few, only; how he might bring <hi>Scotland</hi> under his Subjection; The Thing was thought feasa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble enough, in regard the Kingdom was divided into Two Factions, but to make the Way more Intricate, and the Fraud more Covert, he raised up Three other Competitors, besides <hi>Bruce</hi> and <hi>Baliol,</hi> that, out of so great a Number, he might more easily bring over One, or More, to his Party.</p>
            <p>And, lest so great a Matter might seem to be determined unad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visedly, he consulted with Those, who were most eminent in <hi>France,</hi> for Piety, Prudence, and the Knowledge of the Law. Neither did he doubt, but that (as that sort of Men are never always of One Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion) he should fish something out of their Answers, which might make for his purpose; The New Competitors, seeing no Grounds for their Pretensions, of their own accord quickly desisted; but to the Lawyers, whom he Governed and Influenced, as he pleased, a false, or made, Case was Stated and Propounded, Thus, <hi>A certain King, that was never wont to be Crowned, nor Anointed,</hi>

It would be too prolix a Task, to reckon up particularly all the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, but, in brief,<note place="margin">The Lawyers differ in their Opinions about it.</note> almost all of them answered very doubtfully and uncertainly, as to the Right of the Competitors; but, as the Case was falsely put, they all gave the Supreme Power of Judgment in the Controversie, to <hi>Edward.</hi> Hereby, the Matter was made more intricate and involved, than before; so that, the next Year, they met again at <hi>Norham.</hi> There, <hi>Edward,</hi> by Agents, fit for his purpose, gently tried the Minds of the <hi>Scots,</hi> Whether they would willingly put Themselves under the Power and Jurisdiction of the <hi>English,</hi> which (as was alleged) their Ancestors had often done: But, when they all unanimously refused so to do, he called to him the Competitors, whom he himself had set up; and, by great Promises, extorted from them, to Swear Homage to him; and he persuades the rest, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the Assembly to <hi>Berwick,</hi> as a more convenient Place.

                  <hi>Edward.</hi> As he was thus musing; it happened commodiously for him, That a new Discord arose betwixt the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>English,</hi> which, presently after, broke out into a War. Whereupon, Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors were sent to the Assembly of Estates in <hi>Scotland,</hi> from Both Kings, The <hi>French</hi>'s Errand, was, to renew the Old League with their New King. And the <hi>English,</hi> was, upon the Account of their late Oath to <hi>Edward,</hi> to receive Aid from them in the War he had undertaken; Both Embassys were referred to the Council of the Estates, where the Nobles, prone to Rebellion, were of Opinion, That the Request of the <hi>French,</hi> was Just; of the <hi>English,</hi> Unjust; For the League made, by universal Consent, with the <hi>French,</hi> more than 500 Years before, had been kept Sacred and Inviolable to that very Day, in regard of the Justness and Utility thereof, but this late Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection and surrendring themselves to the <hi>English,</hi> was extorted from the King, against his Will; and thÃ´ (as they proceeded to allege) he had been willing, yet, it did oblige neither King nor Kingdom; it being made by the King alone, without the Consent of the Estates, whereas the <hi>King might not act any Thing, relating to the Publick state of the Kingdom, without, much less, against, the Advice of the States.</hi> So a Decree was made, that Embassadors should be sent into <hi>France</hi> to renew the Ancient League;<note place="margin">He sides with the <hi>French.</hi>
                  </note> and that a Wife should be desired for <hi>Edward Baliol,</hi> Son to <hi>Iohn,</hi> out of the Kings Royal stem.

No man of any Eminencie would carry this Message to <hi>Edward,</hi> because he was of a fierce Nature, and was rendred more so, by reason of the Indulgence of Fortune, which made him even almost to forget himself; At last, a certain Monk, or, as some say, the Abbat of <hi>Aberbrothoc</hi> carried Letters, of that Import, to him, who was grievously affronted for his Pains, and had much ado to escape home, being protected more by his, undervalued, Tenuity, than the Reverence of his Embassadorship.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, <hi>Edward,</hi> had made a Truce with the <hi>French</hi> for some Months, hoping, That, before they were ended, he might sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due the <hi>Scots,</hi> taking them unprovided; and therefore, he sent his Fleet, designed for <hi>France,</hi> against <hi>Scotland,</hi> commanding them to stop all Provisions from being carried into <hi>Berwick,</hi> wherein,<note place="margin">Whereupon <hi>Edward</hi> War<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Afterwards, he joined all his Forces together at <hi>Dunbar,</hi> to fight the <hi>Scots</hi> Army, who came to relieve it; The Battel was fierce; and the Victory inclining to the <hi>English,</hi> the chief of the Nobility fled into the Castle, but the Castle was soon taken, either by the Perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diousness of <hi>Richard Stuart,</hi> the Governor, or else, because he had not Provisions for so great a Multitude, as were shut up in so narrow a Compass: <hi>Edward</hi> was very cruel to all the Prisoners: Some cast the Blame of this Overthrow upon <hi>Robert Bruce</hi> the Elder, in that his Friends giving back in the Battel, it strook a Terrour into the rest.

                  </note> a Man of an Ancient and Noble Family, but one that had lived poorly and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as having little or no Estate; yet, this Man performed in this War, not only beyond the Expectation, but even the Belief, of all the Common People; For he was bold-spirited, and strong-bodied, and, when he was but a Youth, had slain a young <hi>English</hi> Nobleman, who proudly domineered over him. For this Fact, he was fain to run away, and to skulk up and down in several places, for some years, to save his Life, and, by this Course of Life his Body was hardned against Wind and Weather, and his Mind also fortified to undergo greater hazards, when time should serve. At length, growing weary of such an Erratick Life, he resolved to attempt something, though never so hazardous; and therefore gathered a Band of Men together, of like Fortune with himself, and did not only assault single Persons, but even greater Companies, though with an inferior Number, and accordingly he slew several Persons, in divers Places. He played his Pranks with as much Celerity as Boldness, and never gave his Enemy opportunity to fight him, so that in a short time, his Fame was spread over Both Nations, by which means many came in to him, moved by the likeness of their Cause, or, with the like Love of their Country; thus he made up a considerable Army. And see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Nobles were sluggish in their Management of Affairs, either out of Fear or Dulness, this <hi>Wallace</hi> was proclaimed <hi>Regent,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">He is made Regent;</note> by the
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:56771:136"/>
Tumultuous Band that followed him, and so he managed Things as a Lawful Magistrate, and the Substitute of <hi>Baliol.</hi> He accepted of this Name, not out of any Ambition, or Desire to Rule, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was cast upon him by the Love and Good Will of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen. With this Army, the first visible Exploit he performed was at <note place="margin">The chief Town of <hi>Clydsdale.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Lanerick,</hi> where he slew the Major General of that Precinct, being an <hi>Englishman,</hi> of good Descent. Afterwards he took and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molished many Castles, which were either slenderly Fortified, or meanly Garisoned; or else, guarded negligently; which petty At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts so encouraged his Soldiers, that they shunned no Service, no not the most hazardous, under his Conduct, as having experienced, That his Boldness was guided by Counsel; and That Counsel se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded by good Success.</p>
               <p>When the Report of these Things was spread abroad, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, somewhat enlarged, beyond the Bounds of Truth, out of Mens Respect and Favour to him; All that wished well to their Country, or were afraid of their own particular Conditions,<note place="margin">And takes many Places from the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish.</hi>
                  </note> flocked in to him, as judging it fit, to take Opportunity by the Forelock; so that, in a short time, he reduced all the Castles, which the <hi>English</hi> held on the other side of the <hi>Forth,</hi> though never so well fortified, and, for fear of him, carefully Guarded. He took and demolished the Castles of <hi>Dundee, Forfar, Brechin,</hi> and <hi>Montross</hi>; he seized on <hi>Dunoter,</hi> una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares, and Garisoned it; he entred <hi>Aberdene,</hi> (which the Enemy, for fear of his coming, had plundered and burnt) even whilst it was in Flames; but, a Rumour, being scattered abroad, concerning the coming of the <hi>English</hi> Army, prevented his Taking the Castle; for, he determined to meet them at the <hi>Forth,</hi> not being willing to hazard a Battel, but in a Place, he himself should choose. <hi>Edward</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> when he went into <hi>France,</hi> (as I said before) put <hi>English</hi> Garisons into all the Strong Holds of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and besides, having many of the <hi>Scots</hi> faithful to him, and unfaithful to their Country, he banished and sent the <hi>Scots</hi> Nobility, whom he most suspected, into the heart of <hi>England,</hi> till his return. Amongst which was <hi>Iohn Cumins,</hi>

                  </note> Lord, or Petty King, of <hi>Badenach</hi>; and <hi>Alan Longan,</hi> a Man fit both for Advice and Action; and having setled Matters, after this sort, he was so far from fearing any Insurrection in <hi>Scotland,</hi> that he carried all his Army over along with him. But, hearing of the many Exploits of <hi>Wallace,</hi> he thought there was need of a greater Force to suppress him; yet, that the Expedition was not worthy of a King, neither, (as being only against a Roving Thief, for so the <hi>English</hi> called <hi>Wallace</hi>) and therefore he writes to <hi>Henry Percy,</hi> Earl of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland,</hi> and <hi>William Latimer,</hi> That they should speedily Levy what Forces they could out of the Neighbouring Parts, and join themselves with <hi>Cressingham,</hi> who as yet remained in <hi>Scotland,</hi> to subdue the Rebellious <hi>Scots. Thomas Walsingham</hi> writes, that the Earl of <hi>Warren</hi> was General in this Expedition. But <hi>Wallace,</hi> who was then besieging the Castle of <hi>Cowper</hi> in <hi>Fife,</hi> left his Army, which he had increased against the coming of the <hi>English,</hi> should be idle, the <hi>English</hi> being near at hand, marched directly to <hi>Sterlin.</hi> The River <hi>Forth,</hi> no where, almost, fordable, may be there passed over by a Bridge of Wood, though it be increased by the Addition of

There <hi>Cressing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> passed over with the greatest part of his Army, but the Bridge, either having its Beams loosned and disjointed, on purpose, by the Skill of the Architect, (as our Writers say, it was) that so it might not be able to bear any great Weight; or else, being overladen with the heavy burden of so many Horse, Foot, and Carriages, as passed over, was broken, and so the March of the rest of the <hi>English</hi> was precluded, and hindred; The <hi>Scots</hi> set upon Those,<note place="margin">He overthrows <hi>Cressingham</hi> the <hi>English</hi> General at <hi>Sterlin</hi> Bridge.</note> who were passed over, before they could put themselves into a Posture; and, having slain their General, drove the rest back into the River, the Slaughter was so great, that they were all either killed or drowned; <hi>Wallace</hi> returned, from this Fight, to the besieging of Castles; and, in a short time, he so changed the Scene of Affairs, that he left none of the <hi>English</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> but such as were made Prisoners. This Victory (wherein none of any eminency, among the <hi>Scots</hi> fell, save <hi>Andrew Murray,</hi> whose Son, some years, was Regent of <hi>Scotland</hi>) was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the <hi>Ides</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> in the year of <hi>Christ</hi> 1297.

               <p>By means of these Combustions, the Fields lay untilled, insomuch, that, after that Overthrow, a Famine ensued, and a Pestilence after the Famine; from whence a greater Fear was apprehended, than from the War: <hi>Wallis,</hi> to prevent this Mischief as much as he could, called together all those, who were fit for Service, to appear at a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain day, with whom he marched into <hi>England,</hi> thinking with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, that their Bodies, being exercised with Labour,<note place="margin">He enters with an Army into <hi>England.</hi>

                  </note> and having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshed and inriched his Soldiers, with the Fruits and Spoils of the Enemy, he returned home, with great Renown. This Expedition, as it increased the Fame and Authority of <hi>Wallis</hi> amongst the Vulgar sort, so it heightned the envy of Nobles against him, mightily.

So that, thÃ´ he himself had much the greater Force, yet he durst not put it to the hazard of a Battel, against such a Veteran and Experienced a Captain, and against Soldiers inured to all hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships, but turned his Ensigns, and marched slowly back: <hi>Wallace</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so durst not follow him,<note place="margin">The <hi>Scots</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles envy <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace</hi> for his Success.</note> for fear of Ambushes, but kept his Army with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their Trenches.

Edward</hi> was not ignorant of these Disgusts, and therefore, the next Summer he Levies a Great Army, consisting partly of <hi>English,</hi> partly of <hi>Scots,</hi> who had remained Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to him, and came to <hi>Falkirk,</hi> which is a Village built in the very Tract of the Wall of <hi>Severus,</hi> and is distant from <hi>Sterling,</hi> little more than 6 Miles. The <hi>Scots</hi> Army were not far from them, of suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent strength, for they were 30000. if the Generals and Leaders had agreed amongst themselves; Their Generals were <hi>Iohn Cumins, Iohn Stuart,</hi> and <hi>William Wallace,</hi> the most flourishing Persons amongst the <hi>Scots</hi>; the Two former, for their high Descent and Opulency; the Later, for the glory of his former Exploits.</p>
               <p>When the Three Armies were ready to fight, a new Dispute arose, besides their former Envy, Who should lead the Van of the Army; and when all Three stood upon their Terms, the <hi>English</hi> decided the Controversie, who, with Banners displaid, marched with a swift pace towards them; <hi>Cumins</hi> and his Forces retreated, without stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a stroke;<note place="margin">

                  <q>He wondred what was in his Mind, that, being hurried on by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain Favour of the Vulgar, he should expose himself to such assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duous and imminent Danger, against a King, the most potent of that Time, and who was also assisted by a great Number of the <hi>Scots</hi>; and that to no purpose neither, for, if he overcame <hi>Edward,</hi> the <hi>Scots</hi> would never Grant him the Kingdom; and, if himself were overcome, he had no Refuge but in the Mercy of his Enemy. To whom <hi>Wallas</hi> replyed, I never proposed that Scope to my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs and Labours, as to obtain the Kingdom, of which my For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune is not capable, neither doth my Mind aspire thereunto: But when I saw my Countrymen, by your slothfulness (to whom the

<pb n="263" facs="tcp:56771:140" rendition="simple:additions"/>
wherein, they might Treat of Terms of Peace: The Truce being obtained, <hi>Cumins</hi> made no more Mention of Peace, but encreas'd his Forces as much as ever he could; neither would he trust the <hi>Scots</hi> that were with him, (the Favour of many of them inclining to <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi>) but craved Aid from <hi>England.</hi> In the mean time, <hi>Bruce,</hi> to remove the Contemptible Opinion, which the English might conceive of him; and to encourage the Spirits of his Friends, was always nibbling at his Enemies Heels; here taking <hi>some,</hi> there <hi>others</hi>; and, surprizing their weakest Garisons, he never staid long in a Place, neither gave he Opportunity to the Enemy to fight him.</p>

               <p>Not long after, Both Kings, almost in the same Moment of time, fell grievously Sick; <hi>Edward,</hi> being busie in Preparations for War against <hi>Scotland,</hi> died within a few days at <hi>Lancaster,</hi> leaving his Second Son, <hi>Edward,</hi> for his Heir, who was called <hi>Edward</hi> of <hi>Carnar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>von,</hi> from the Place where he was Born; he, marching into his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Country, with the Army, which his Father had recruited, sent a Proclamation before to <hi>Dumfreiz, That all the</hi> Scots <hi>should meet him there,</hi> but there came in but a Few, and those out of the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Parts, and very heavily too. He being also informed, That his Matters beyond Sea went not well on, left a Force, such as he thought sufficient, to quell the Insurrection in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and settling things as soon as he could, he passed over into <hi>France.</hi> In the interim, <hi>Robert,</hi>

                  </note> On the other side, <hi>Robert,</hi> to encourage his Men, caused himself to be set on Horseback.

And not long after, <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Randolph</hi> recovered the Strong Castle of <hi>Edinburgh</hi>; The Isle of <hi>Man</hi> was also surrendred, and the Castles thereof demolished, that they might not, again, be a Receptacle to the Enemy. In the mean time, <hi>Edward Bruce</hi> closely besieged the Castle of <hi>Sterlin,</hi> scituate on a Rock, steep every way but one, where the Passage to it lay. It was defended by <hi>Philip Mowbray,</hi> a vigilant Commander, who, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Success of the <hi>Brucians</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi>; and, foreseeing a Siege, had mightily stored and fortified it with Arms and Provisions, before hand. And therefore, when <hi>Edward</hi> had fruitlessly spent many days in besieging it, and had no hopes to carry it, by force, That he might not seem to be repulsed without doing any thing, he enters into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions with <hi>Mowbray,</hi>

                     </note> then the Castle was to be surrendred, and the Garison should have Liberty, Bag and Baggage, to march whither they pleased.</q>
These Conditions did much displease the King, yet, that he might not detract from his Brothers Credit, he resolved to observe them. Yet, in regard he did not doubt, but the <hi>English</hi> would come at the time appointed, he prepares, as much, as, in so great a scarcity of things, he was able, to manage his last Encounter with his potent Enemy. And indeed, <hi>Edward,</hi> considering, that he was not only dispossessed of <hi>Scotland,</hi> whose People his Father had left to him conquered and broken; but that <hi>England</hi> was also in danger, had a desire to root out so Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, Disobedient and Unquiet a Nation. In order whereunto,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Edward</hi> of <hi>England</hi> enters <hi>Scotland</hi> with a vast Army.</note> he levied an Army, not only of <hi>English</hi> and such <hi>Scots</hi> who adhered to them, but he increased it by supplys from his Transmarine Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, (which <hi>then</hi> were many, great, and opulent) so that his Army was bigger, than ever any King of <hi>England</hi> had, before. Yea, he received also an Accession of Force from his Allyes beyond the Seas, especially from <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> whom his Father had strenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously assisted against <hi>Philip,</hi> King of <hi>France.</hi> They say, it consisted of above 100000 Fighting men. There followed also his Army, a Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Baggagers, Attendants, and Sutlers, who carries Provision both by Sea and Land, because they were to come into a Country not very fruitful of it self; and besides, which had, so many years before, been harassed with all the Miseries of War. Moreover, there was a Multitude of Such, as were to set out, or describe, Colonies, and to receive Dividends of Land, who brought their Wives and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren along with them; so that the Force of so Rich, Powerful and Flourishing a Kingdom, as <hi>England</hi> was, being thus, as it were, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridged and epitomized into one Army, the Consideration thereof produced such a Confidence in them all, That, now, all the Discourse was, not of Fighting, but rather of Dividing the Spoil. <hi>Bruce,</hi> hearing
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:56771:142"/>
of this great Preparation of the Enemy, prepares also his Forces, far inferiour in Number to so great a Multitude, as being Thirty Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand only, but such, as were inured to Hardships, and the Toyl of a Civil War; and who now carried the Hopes of their Lives, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, and of all that is dear to Men, as it were, on the Point of their Swords. With this Army, he sate down on the left Bank of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Bannock.</hi> This River hath steep Banks on Both sides, and it had but a few, and those too, narrow, Passages, or Fords; it is about Two Miles from <hi>Sterlin</hi>; Below the Hills, before it makes its influxe into the <hi>Forth,</hi> it passeth thrÃ´ a little leveller Ground, yet, here and there, it is Marshy. In the Winter it usually runs with a rapid Torrent; but, in that hot Time of the Year, the Water was but Low and Ford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, in many Places. <hi>Bruce,</hi> by how much the Weaker in Force, was so much the more Circumspect,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bruce</hi> his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy in a Fight.</note> and therefore he used Art and Policy to make the Passage over the River more difficult, to the <hi>English,</hi> who possessed the right-hand Bank thereof. In order where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, he caused deep Trenches to be dug in level Places, wherein he fastened sharp Stakes, or Spikes, and covered them with some light Turffs a top, that so his Stratagem might not be discovered; and moreover, he caused <note n="*" place="margin">Small Engins, ordinarily round, with sharp Iron Spikes, standing out on each side of Them, so that, throw them which way soever you will upon the Ground, one Spike or other turns upward, and wounds, or pierces, the Horses Foot, that treads upon it, and thus makes him Lame and unfit for Service.</note> 
                  <hi>Calthrops</hi> of Iron to be thrown up and down on the Ground, in Places most convenient.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, when Camp was almost joyned to Camp, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on different Hills, only a small River between them: <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> sent 800 Horse a little before to <hi>Sterlin,</hi> who marched a little off from the Camp; <hi>Robert,</hi> imagining, that they were sent to plunder in the Neighbourhood, gave command to <hi>Thomas Randolph</hi> to follow them, with 500 Horse, either to prevent the stragglers in wasting the Country, or, if a fit Occasion were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, to fight them. The <hi>English,</hi> seeing them, desisted from their intended March to <hi>Sterlin,</hi> and faced about. The Fight was sharp, and continued long, the Victory inclining, for a time, to neither Party, so that <hi>Iames Douglas,</hi> being concerned for the <hi>Scots,</hi> who were the fewer in Number, earnestly desired <hi>Bruce,</hi> That he might go and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them. <hi>Bruce</hi> peremptorily denied him, whereupon, tho', at present, a Spectator only from an Hill, yet he resolved, if the <hi>Scots</hi> were further distressed, to succour them; but, perceiving the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi> to give back, and the <hi>Scots</hi> to get Ground, he stopped his March, that so he might detract nothing from another mans Praise. The <hi>English,</hi> having lost but those Few out of so numerous an Army, were not discouraged in their Spirits, and also the <hi>Scots</hi> prepared themselves for the Encounter, the next day, as if they had already received an <hi>Omen</hi> of a compleat Victory.</p>

They that first fell in, were Slain by the pressure of Those that fell upon them, and the last Ranks being discouraged at the loss of the First, retreated back. This Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror did also somewhat retard the Foot, for they were afraid of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into the like Snares. There also did happen another Accident, which, thÃ´ little in itself, yet contributed very much (as such Nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are wont to do in War) to the main Chance. <hi>Robert</hi> rode up and down before his Army, to keep them in their Ranks, having a Batoon in his Hand, a certain <hi>Englishman</hi> knew him, and ran at him with his Spear. The King avoided the blow, and, as the Horse, in his Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier, ran a little beyond him, struck his Rider dead with his Batoon, and down he tumbled from his Horse, to the ground. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Soldiers highly commended the perillous Audacity of the King; and were hardly kept in by their Commanders, but hand over head, would rush upon the Enemy, with such an eagerness of Mind, that they were likely to break their Enemies Ranks, unless the <hi>English</hi> Archers, who were placed in their Wings, had repulsed them with great Loss; and <hi>Bruce</hi> also sent in some Troops of Horse, who drove them back; Yet, in this Action, a Mistake did more prejudice to the <hi>English,</hi> than their Enemy did. The Rabble-Rout, which followed the Camp, caused the Baggage-men to mount their Draught horses and to hang out some Linen Cloth instead of Ensigns, thus they stood on an Hill, where they might easily be seen, and made an Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of a new Army. The <hi>English,</hi> who stood nearest, were surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed with a double Fear, and betook themselves to their Heels. Their Fear disordered the rest of the Army.

He demanded the Country, or Earldom of <hi>Lennox,</hi> as the Price of his Treachery, and Surrender. Neither would he ever so much as hear of any other Terms. In this Case, the King did waver and fluctuate in his Mind, what to do; on the One side, he earnestly desired to have the Castle; yet, on the Other, he did not so much prize it, as, for its sake, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oblige the Earl of <hi>Lennox,</hi> who had been his Fast, and almost his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Friend, in all his Calamities.

Hereupon, the King, upon the Surrender of the other Parts of the Castle by <hi>Iohn,</hi> being kindly invited to a Feast, refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to eat; till, as he had searched all other parts of the Castle, so he had viewed that Wine-Cellar, also.

But, if he also should decease without Issue Male, then the Crown was to descend to <hi>Mary,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Robert,</hi> and to her Posterity; yet so, that the Nobility were to provide her an Husband fit for her Royal Estate, and for the Succession in the Kingdom.

               <p>The next Year, a double Embassy was sent, One to the Pope, to reconcile him to the <hi>Scots,</hi> from whom he had been alienated by the Calumnies of the <hi>English</hi>; and Another to renew the Ancient League with the <hi>French.</hi> They Both easily obtained what they desired: For, when the Pope understood, That the Controversy arose by the Injury and Default of <hi>Edward</hi> the First, who affirmed,
<q>That the King of <hi>Scots</hi> ought to obey, as a Feudatary, the King of <hi>England</hi>; and, That the <hi>English</hi> had nothing to defend their Claim by, but old Fables, and late Injuries; and besides, That, in Prosperity, being Summoned by the Pope, they always avoided an equal Decision of Things, tho, in their Adversity, they were always humble suiters to him for his Aid; and, on the other side, the <hi>Scots</hi> always were willing to have their Cause heard,<note place="margin">The <hi>Scots</hi> ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved by the Pope.</note> and never shunned the Determination of an Equal Judge, nor the Arbitration of any Good men; and moreover, when they produced many Grants and Summons of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Popes, which made for them, and against their Enemies, the <hi>Scots</hi> were always present at the day, and the <hi>English,</hi> tho' they had Notice given, never came.</q>
Hereupon, the Pope was easily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to the <hi>Scots</hi>; and the <hi>French</hi> as easily induced to renew the Ancient League, only one Article was added to the old Conditions,
<q>That if any Controversy did hereafter arise amongst the <hi>Scots,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">And make a League with the <hi>French.</hi>

               <p>There was a certain Nobleman in the Court of <hi>England,</hi> who spake Honourably of the Fortune and Valour of <hi>Bruce;</hi> whereupon, one of the <hi>Spencers,</hi> Bed-Chamber Man to the King, either thinking, That his Speech was Reproachful to the <hi>English</hi>; or else,<note place="margin">The Rise of the Family of the <hi>Hamiltons,</hi> with the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion thereof.</note> to curry Favour with the looser sort of the Nobility, drew forth his Faucheon, and, making at him, gave him a slight wound in the Body. The Man, being of a great Spirit, was more concerned at the Contumely, than at the Damage; and, being hindered by the coming in of many, to part the Fray, from taking present Revenge; the day after, finding his Enemy in a sit Posture, in the same place, he run him thorough: And fearing the Punishment of the Law, and the great Power of the <hi>Spencers</hi> at Court, he fled presently into <hi>Scotland,</hi> to King <hi>Robert,</hi> by whom he was courteously received, and some Lands, near the River <hi>Clyde,</hi> were bestowed upon him. His Posterity, not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, were admitted to the Degree of Noblemen; and the Opulent Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of the <hi>Hamiltons</hi> was Sirnamed from him, and also the Name of <hi>Hamilton</hi> was imposed on the Lands, which the King gave him.</p>
               <p>Not long after, <hi>Edward</hi> had great Combustions at home, insomuch, that he put many of the Nobles to Death, and advanced the <hi>Spencers,</hi> the Authors of all Evil Counsel, higher than his own Kindred could

His Wife and Son were thought Privy to the Parricide, either, because his Keepers would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have dared to commit such a Deed, so openly, unless they had had Great Authors; or else, because they were never called in Question for so Immane a Butchery.</p>
               <p>These Disturbances in <hi>England,</hi> which were followed by the Kings Death, <hi>Bruce</hi> also growing old and weak in Body, were the Occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,<note place="margin">

For <hi>Bruce,</hi> being freed from the Fear of the <hi>English,</hi> and being also called upon by his Age, converted his Thoughts to settle his Domestick Affairs. And first, he made hast to confirm the Kingdom, (which was not yet quite recovered, nor fully setled, from the Commotions of former Times) to his only Son, yet but a Child, by the Consent and Decree of the Estates. And, if he died without Issue, then he appointed <hi>Robert Stuart,</hi> his Nephew by his Daughter, to be his Successor: He caused the Nobles to take an Oath, for the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of this Decree. But afterwards, fearing. That, after his Death, <hi>Baliol</hi> would begin his old Dispute, about the Kingdom; es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially seeing his Heirs, because of their Minority, might be liable to be injured by others; he sent <hi>Iames Douglas</hi> to <hi>Iohn Baliol,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>France,</hi> with large Gifts and Promises, That he would cease his Claim to the Kingdom: This he did, not so much to acquire a new Right, (because, according to the <hi>Scotish</hi> Custom, <hi>The King is made by the Decree of the Estates, who have the Supream Power in their Hands</hi>;) but, that he might cut off all Occasion from Wicked Men, to Calumniate his Posterity; and also, that he might Eradicate the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Seeds of Sedition. <hi>Douglas</hi> found <hi>Baliol</hi> far more placable, than he, or others, thought, he would be; for he was now surrounded with the Miseries of Extream Old Age.<note place="margin">And agrees with <hi>Baliol</hi> then in <hi>France,</hi> who consents the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<q>That his Peccant Exorbitance was justly restrained, and that he was deservedly driven out of the Kingdom, as unworthy to Reign. And therefore, he was very willing, That his Kinsman <hi>Robert</hi> should enjoy the Crown, by whose high Valour, singular Felicity, and great Pains-taking, 'twas Vindicated into its Ancient Splendour: In one thing, he rejoyced, That they, by whom he was deceived, did not enjoy the Reward of their Perfidiousness.</q>

               <p>When <hi>Robert</hi> had setled these Matters, according to his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, the same Year, which was 1327. our Writers say, That Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors were sent into <hi>Scotland,</hi> by <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, for a Pacifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; in which Matter, they seemed to act Treacherously, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of Peace, they carried home War, but what the particular Fraud, was, is not expressed, and the <hi>English</hi> say, That the War was openly denounced by <hi>Robert,</hi> but they describe not the Cause of it; surely, it must needs be some great and mighty One; or else, a vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudinary old Man, when Peace was scarce setled at home; and, who might have been sated with his former Victories, rather than with

The Reason was, That they might fly up and down swiftly, and not abide in one place; nor, be forced to Fight the <hi>English,</hi> unless they themselves pleased. For they knew, that the <hi>English</hi> would make Head against them in their first Expedition,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Edward</hi> makes Head against them.</note> with a far more numerous Army: Neither were they deceived in their Opinions, for the King of <hi>England,</hi> besides his Domestick Forces, had procured great Assistance of Horse, from <hi>Belgium</hi>; but, in regard they and the <hi>English</hi> fell out at <hi>York,</hi> some <hi>English</hi> Writers say, That they returned home again. But <hi>Frossard,</hi> a <hi>French</hi> Writer of the same Age, says, That they accompanied the <hi>English</hi> during the whole Expedition; and that, not only for Honours sake, but also for Fear of Sedition, they had the next Place to the Kings Regiment, always assigned to them, in the Camp. The King, having made a Conjunction of all his Forces, (which were clearly above Sixty Thousand Men) marched against the <hi>Scots,</hi> who had already passed over the <hi>Tine.</hi> Now, there were Two Fortified Towns on the <hi>Tine.</hi> One nearer <hi>Wales,</hi> which was <hi>Carlisle</hi>; and the other, about Fifty Miles lower, called <hi>Newcastle.</hi> The <hi>English</hi> had strongly Garisoned Both of them, to hinder the Enemies Passage over the River; but the <hi>Scots,</hi> knowing, where the River was fordable, passed over without any noise, and so deceived both the Garisons. When the <hi>English</hi> were come into the <hi>Bishoprick</hi> of <hi>Durham,</hi> from the Tops of the Hills, they might see Fires afar off, and then beginning to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, how near their Enemy was, they tumultuously cryed, <hi>Arm, Arm,</hi> as if they were presently to fall to it.</p>
               <p>They drew forth their Army into a Threefold Order of Battel, and marched directly to the Place,<note place="margin">The <hi>Scots</hi> fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Army of Horse weary the <hi>Eng<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thus they wearied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves till the Evening, and then mark'd out a Place for their Camp, in a Wood, near a certain River, and there they placed their Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage and Carriages, which could not so swiftly follow the Flying Army.</p>
               <p>The next day, they marched in the same Order, and towards Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, they were forced to abide in their Tents, which they had pitched, as conveniently as the Place would afford, that so the Draught-Horses, and the Foot, might receive a little Refreshment. There the Nobles came to the King, and deliberated, How they should bring the <hi>Scots</hi> to a Battel. The most Part were of Opinion, That the <hi>English</hi> Foot were never able to overtake the flying Horse of the <hi>Scots,</hi> and if they did, yet they could not compel them to Fight, but in those Places, which they themselves judged most Convenient: But because there was such a general Devastation, that they could not stay long in an Enemies Country; they judged it best, to pass over the <hi>Tine,</hi> with all their Forces, and to intercept the Enemy in his Return home. And besides, the Country beyond the <hi>Tine</hi> was plainer
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:56771:147"/>
and fitter to draw up an Army in, that so the whole Body of the Army might be put upon Service. This Opinion was approved, and a Command given to refresh Themselves, and to do it as silently as ever they could, That they might more easily hear the word of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and the sound of the Trumpets; That so, leaving the Baggage behind, every one should carry a Loaf a piece; and, as if the next day they were to fight the Enemy, they were to await the Event of Fortune; so that their Bodies being refreshed from the weariness of the day before, a little after Midnight, they took up their Arms, and, in good order, begun their March; But the Marishes and Hills, by which they were to pass, quickly made them to break their Ranks, and he, that could, led the Van; the Rest followed their Steps, and their March was in such Disorder, that many Horse, and Carriage-Beasts, did either stick in the Mud, or else, did tumble down from steep Places, and oft times they cryed, <hi>To your Arms,</hi> and then all of them, in great Trepidation, ran to the Place from whence the Noise and Cry came, without any Order at all. But when they came to those that led the Van,<note place="margin">Stags, suddenly rouzed, affright the <hi>English.</hi>
                  </note> they understood, That the Tumult was occasioned by a Multitude of Stags; who, being rouzed out of the Heath, by the Noise of Men, and afraid to see them, ran up and down in great Confusion, amongst the <hi>Brigades.</hi> At last, about Evening, the Horse, but without the Foot, came to the Fords of <hi>Tine,</hi> over which the <hi>Scots</hi> had passed, and by which, they would return (as they hoped) and, at Sun-set, they Forded over; the round and slippery Stones, which the River roles up and down, much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commoding their Horse. And besides, they were afflicted with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Inconvenience, They had, few or none of them, any Iron Tools to cut down Wood with; so that, after they had marched Twenty Eight Miles, they were fain to lie in their Arms, that Night, on the bare Ground, holding their Horses Bridles, in one of their Hands; for, they could not cut down Wood to make Tents, (having brought none with them) nor Huts, nor so much as Stakes to tye their Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to. Early in the Morning, assoon as it was light, there fell such mighty showres of Rain,<note n="*" place="margin">The <hi>English</hi> Army highly incommoded in their march.</note> that even small Brooks were hardly passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, by Man or Horse; and also, they were inform'd by some Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Men, which they took, That the Neighbouring Country was so Barren and Desolate, That no Provision was to be had, nearer than <hi>Newcastle</hi> and <hi>Carlisle</hi>; of which, one was Twenty Four, the other Thirty, Miles off. Thither they sent their Draught-Horses and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; in the mean time, they made use of their Swords, to cut down Stakes to tye their Horses to; and some Shrubs and small Trees to build them Huts, with the Leaves whereof they fed their Horses, and so, that Night, they were fain to Fast.</p>
               <p>Three Days after, they, that were sent to the Towns, returned with some small Provisions, which they brought along with them; some Sutlers came also with them, with Bread and Wine, to make a Gain of; but it was but little, and also, not Good; yet, such as it was, the Soldiers were ready to fall out, Who should have it, first. Having thus passed Seven days, in great Want, and being also much molested with continual Showres, so that their Horse-Furniture was wet, and their Horses Backs did Ulcerate, and they themselves
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:56771:147"/>
stood (many of them) Armed, Day and Night, in their wet Cloaths; neither could they make any Fire, by reason, that the Wood was Green; and besides, it was wetted by the Rain water; The Eighth day, they resolved to repass the River at a more commodious Ford, Seven miles above the Place, where they were; but there also the River was swoln by reason of the Showres, so that they were much incommoded, and some were drowned, in their passage. As soon as they had landed their Army upon the other side, a great Reward was proposed to him, Who could bring the first certain Tidings, Where the <hi>Scots</hi> were. The Two next Days, their March lying thrÃ´ desolate places, and ruined by late Fires, they had Forage enough for their Horses, but little Provision for Themselves. On the Fourth Day, One of the Fifteen young Men, who scouted out to bring News where the <hi>Scots</hi> lay, returned back, and informed them, That the <hi>Scots</hi> Army was about Three Miles distance from Theirs; and that, for Eight Days last past, They had been as uncertain what became of the <hi>English,</hi> as the <hi>Engl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>sh</hi> had been what became of Them. This he affirmed for Truth, as having been taken Prisoner by the <hi>Scots,</hi> and freed without Ransom, upon Condition, he would go tell his King, <hi>That, they would wait for his Coming in that Place; and, That they were as willing to Fight, as He.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon the Receipt of this Message, the King Commanded the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to make an Halt, that Man and Horse might take some Refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and so be ready for the last Encounter; and thus, in Three Brigades, he marched slowly towards the Enemy. Assoon as they came in fight one of another, the <hi>Scots</hi> had so divided their Men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Three Batailions upon an Hill, that the Rocks and Precipices there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of secured them on the Right and Left, from whence, they might cast down Stones on the Enemy, if they endeavoured to come up to them. At the Foot of the Hill, the <hi>English</hi> had a rapid Torrent to pass, so full of Great and Round Stones, that they could not Ford over to their Enemy; or, if they had so done, they could not Retreat without certain Ruin. The <hi>English,</hi> perceiving that they could not come at the Enemy, but with great disadvantage, pitched their Tents; and sent an Herald at Arms to the <hi>Scots,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Reparties be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween both Armies.</note> advising them to <hi>come down into the Champion Country, to Fight for Glory and Empire by true Valour, in an open Plain</hi>: The <hi>Scots</hi> answered, <hi>That they would Fight for no bodies pleasure, but their own; That they marched into</hi> England, <hi>to revenge the Injuries they had received; if they had done any thing which did offend them, they had free Liberty to take their own Revenge. As for Themselves, they resolved to abide There, as long as they pleased; and if their Enemy did attaque them, at his Peril be it.</hi> The next Three Days, their Camps being near, and Parties placed at the Fords, some slight Skirmishes passed betwixt them; the Fourth Day, assoon as it was Light, the Watch brought Word, That the <hi>Scots</hi> had forsaken the Hill, on which they were; whereupon, Scouts were sent out to bring certain News, and to follow them, if they had Retreated; who brought word, That the <hi>Scots</hi> had pitched their Tents on another Hill by the same River, much more convenient for them than the First, where they had a Wood which secured their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress and Egress. The <hi>English,</hi> who hoped that they should Famish
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:56771:148"/>
the <hi>Scots,</hi> (who avoided Fighting) in a Foreign Soil, being fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated of their Expectation, followed them, and pitched their Tents on an opposite Hill. After they had abode there some Days, it was observed, That they grew more Negligent than formerly in their Night-watches; either, because they undervalued the <hi>Scots,</hi> because of their Paucity, or else, because they meditated nothing, but Flight. <hi>Douglas</hi> took hold of the Opportunity, to attempt something, and passing over the River with 200 Select Horse, he entred the Enemies Camp, where, he saw, it was but slenderly Guarded. He had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most pierced to the King's own Tent,<note place="margin">

At last, it was told them by a <hi>Scot,</hi> whom they had taken Prisoner, That there was a Proclamation in that Camp, That, at the Third Watch, all should be ready to follow <hi>Douglas,</hi> whither-soever he should lead them.

And moreover, they placed strong Guards at all the Fords of the River. At last, towards Day, Two <hi>Scots</hi> Trumpeters were brought to the King, who told him, <hi>That the</hi> Scots <hi>were Commanded to returned home; and if the</hi> English <hi>had a mind to revenge the Loss they had sustained, they must Follow them.</hi>

When their Retreat was resolved upon, many of the <hi>English,</hi> either in hopes of Prey, which might be left behind in their hasty Retreat; or else, desirous to understand something of their Enemies Affairs, went into their Camp, where they found about Five Hundred Deer, and especially Stags, already killed, (of which sort, the <hi>English</hi> keep many, not only their Kings, but even many private Persons also,) and also great Budgets, made of raw Skins, in which they boiled their Meat, and about Ten Thousand Snapsacks. Moreover,<note place="margin">Cruelty to Prisoners.</note> there were Two <hi>English</hi> Men, whose Legs were broken, but they were yet alive.

                  <q>That the <hi>English</hi> should renounce all Right, which they, or their Ancestors, pretended to have to the Crown of <hi>Scotland</hi>; and, That they should leave That Kingdom as Free, as it was at the Death of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Third; and, That they should be Subject to no External Yoke of Servitude; and, on the other side, the <hi>Scots</hi> were to surrender up all the Lands, they sometimes held in <hi>England,</hi> as Feudataries; That <hi>Cumberland</hi> and <hi>Northumberland,</hi> as far as <hi>Stanmore,</hi> should be Boundaries to the <hi>Scots</hi>; That <hi>David,</hi> the Son of <hi>Robert,</hi> should take to Wife <hi>Ioan,</hi> the Sister of <hi>Henry</hi>; That the <hi>English</hi> should faithfully return all Pacts, Bonds, and Writings, or any other Monuments of Subjection, into the Hands of the <hi>Scots,</hi> and should disanul them, for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; That the <hi>Scots,</hi> for the Damage which they had lately done the <hi>English</hi> King, and for the Lands which his Father and Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father had given to his Favourites in <hi>Scotland,</hi> should pay him Thirty thousand Marks of Silver.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Both Kings had their proper Reasons, why they consented, so ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily, to these Conditions. The <hi>English</hi> King, having wasted his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and having been put to an Ignominious Flight, and thereby lessened in the Eyes of his own Subjects, as well as of his Enemies, thereupon was afraid, That some Domestick Sedition would arise, and then a Warlike Enemy, pufft up with his late Success, should come on his Flank, and thereby mightily endamage his Kingdom. And <hi>Robert,</hi> being broken with Old Age, Toil, and Diseases, (for, a little before his death, he fell into a Leprosy) having also been long exercised with the events of both Fortunes, good and bad, resolved, if he could, to give up himself to his Ease; and not only so, but to provide for the Tranquillity of his Heirs, in regard of their infirm and tender Age. And therefore, having settled Peace abroad, he turned himself wholly to settle Matters at home. When the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of his Son was magnificently celebrated, he, perceiving the end of his Life to be near at hand, composed himself almost into the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of a private Man, (for some years before, all the Grand Affairs of State had been managed by <hi>Thomas Randolph,</hi> and <hi>Iames Douglas</hi>) and lived in a small House at <hi>Cardross,</hi> (a place divided from <hi>Dum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>britton</hi> by the River <hi>Levin</hi>) and kept himself, but in case of great Necessity, from the Concourse of People. Thither he called some of his Friends, a little before his Death, and made his Will.<note place="margin">

the Number, Bigness, and Power of the Islands, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Multitude, Fierceness, and Hardiness of their Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants; They, with Ships, Such as they were, yet not inconvenient for those Coasts, coping with Men unskill'd in Marine Affairs, might do a great deal of Mischief to others, but receive little Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, themselves: And therefore, Governors were Yearly to be sent thither, to administer Justice amongst them, by Officers, who should not be continued long in their Places, neither. His Second Advice concerning the <hi>English,</hi> stood upon this Foot, Because the <hi>English,</hi> as inhabiting a better Country, did exceed the <hi>Scots</hi> in Number of Men, Money, and all other Warlike Preparations; and by reason of these Conveniencies, they were more accustomed to their Ease, and not so patient of Labour or Hardship: On the other side, the <hi>Scots</hi> were bred in an hardier Soil, and were, by reason of their Parsimony and continual Exercise, of a more healthy Constitution of Body; and, by the very manner of their Education, made more capable to endure all Military Toil; and therefore, That they were fitter for suddain and occasional Assaults, so to weaken and weary out their Enemy, by degrees, than to venture all at once in a pitch'd Battel. His Third Advice was grounded upon this Reason, Because, if the <hi>Scots</hi> should have a long Peace with the <hi>English,</hi> (having no other Enemy besides them to exercise their Arms upon) they would grow Lazy, Luxurious, and so easily become Slothful, Voluptuous, Effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate, and Weak. As for the <hi>English,</hi> though they had Peace with the <hi>Scots,</hi> yet <hi>France</hi> was near them, which kept their Arms in ure; If then, those who are skilful in Warlike Affairs should cope with the <hi>Scots,</hi> thus grown unskilful and sluggish, they might promise to themselves an assured Victory.<note place="margin">

For, What a strong Heart was That, which was not broken, no, nor yet weakened, by so many Miseries as brake in upon him, all at once? Whose Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy would it not have tried, to have his Wife a Prisoner, and to have his Four Valiant Brothers, cruelly put to Death? And his Friends, at the same time, vexed with all kind of Calamities; and they, which escaped with their Lives, were Exiled, and lost all their Estates: As for himself, he was outed not only of a large Patrimony, but of a Kingdom too, by the powerfullest King of those Times, and one, who was most ready, both for Advice and Action. Though he were beset with all these Evils, at one time; yea, and brought into the extreamest Want; yet, he never doubted of recovering the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Neither did he ever do, or say, any thing, which was unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming a Royal Spirit. He did not do, as <hi>Cato</hi> the Younger, and <hi>Marcus Brutus,</hi> who laid violent Hands on themselves; neither did he, as <hi>Marius,</hi> incensed by his Sufferings, let loose the Reins of Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and Passion, against his Enemies; but when he had recovered his Ancient State and Kingdom, he so carried it towards them, who had put him to so much Hardship and Trouble, That he seemed rather to Remember, that he was now their King, than that he had been sometimes their Enemy. And even, a little before his Death, though a great Disease made an addition to the Trouble of his Old Age; yet, he was so much Himself, as to confirm the Present State of the Kingdom; yea, and to consult the quiet of his Posterity. So that, when he died, all Men bewailed him, as being deprived, not only of a Just King, but of a Loving Father, too. He departed this Life, the <note place="margin">

And moreover, <hi>Iames Douglas</hi> being killed in <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>Randolf</hi> by reason of his Sickness, being unfit for the Government, there was not a Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, to whose Authority the giddy and disagreeing Multitude would as soon submit, as to His.</q>

               <p>
                  <hi>Baliol</hi> knew, That what he had spoken was, for the most part, true, and hearing also, that <hi>Edward</hi> of <hi>England</hi> was sending great Forces into <hi>Scotland</hi>; Thereupon the crafty Impostor easily persuaded Him, who of himself was desirous of Empire and Glory, to get what Ships he could together, and so to bear a Part in that Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But, before the coming of <hi>Baliol</hi> into <hi>England, Edward</hi> had disbanded his Army. Nevertheless, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Hereupon, the Governor commanded him to bring some Hogsheads of Wine, and a certain Number of Biskets, and promised him Free Admittance, whenever he came. He, for Fear of the <hi>Scots,</hi> (forsooth) who often made Incursions into the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Parts, promises (happy be lucky) to come betimes, the next Morning.</p>
               <p>That Night, <hi>Douglas,</hi> with Twelve Select Men, accompanying him, clad themselves in Mariners attire, under which their Armour was hid, and so carried Provisions into the Castle; as for his Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, he laid them in Ambush,<note place="margin">And <hi>Edinburgh</hi> Castle by Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem.</note> commanding them to wait for the Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal to be given; <hi>Douglas</hi> and <hi>Simon Frazer</hi> went before, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the rest to follow Them, at a moderate distance; When they were let, by the Porter, into the Fort, which was made of Beames before the Gate of the Castle, they observed, That the Keys of the Doors hung on his Arms, him therefore they killed, and so opened the Castle-Gate; and then, (as they had before agreed) they gave the Signal to their Fellows, by blowing an Horn; the Noise whereof was a Sign to the One, That the Castle was entred by their Friends; To the Other, That it was surprized by their Enemies. Both Parties made all the haste they could, the <hi>Scots</hi> cast down their Burdens in the very Passage of the Gate, lest the Doors might be shut, &amp; so they kept out from their Fellows, who could march but slowly up, on so steep an Ascent: Here, there happened a sharp Dispute with Loss of Both sides, at length the Garison-Soldiers had the worst, who were all slain, except the Governor and six more.</p>

Circumstances, he sent away his Booty before, and placed his Foot in Ambush; and commanded his Horse to straggle abroad, as if they were Flying, and when they came to the Place of Ambush, then to rally again at Sound of Trumpet; The <hi>English,</hi> imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, That the Horse had fled in good earnest, pursued them as dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly; and, when the Signal was given to come together again, they, in a moment, turned back upon Them, The Foot also skip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping out of their Ambushes; which struck such a Consternation, and Terrour, into the <hi>English,</hi> That they fled back faster, than before they had pursued.<note place="margin">And takes <hi>Roxburgh.</hi>

(as Many did, from all Parts of the Kingdom) there came <hi>Alexander Ramsay,</hi> also; who, being eminent both for the splendid Atchievements of his Former Life, and especially for his late, and yet reaking, Conquests, was received with a great deal of Favour,<note place="margin">The <hi>Scots No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles</hi> stock in to <hi>David.</hi>
                  </note> and had the Government of <hi>Roxburgh</hi> bestowed on him; yea, and the Sheriff-wick of all <hi>Teviotdale</hi> was also added to his Authority. <hi>William Douglas</hi> took this mighty heinously, that <hi>Ramsay</hi> was prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before him in that Honour; For, seeing he had expelled the <hi>English</hi> from almost all <hi>Teviotdale,</hi> he had sometimes presided over the Publick Assembly there, thÃ´ without the Kings Command; yet, relying upon his Merits towards his Country, the Nobleness of his Stock, and the Power of his Family, he hoped, That no man would have been his Competitor, for that Office. Whereupon, being wholly bent on Revenge, he, at present, dissembled his Anger, but, in Three Months after, he met with his Adversary, holding an Assembly in the Church of <hi>Hawick,</hi> and unawares assaulted and wounded him,<note place="margin">A Town in <hi>Teviotdale.

               <p>About the same time, <hi>William Bullock,</hi> a Man of singular Loyalty to the King, was put to the same kind of Death, by <hi>David Berclay.</hi> These Two Savage and Cruel Facts filled almost the whole Kingdom with Seditions, and distracted it into several Parties. These things did mightily exercise the King, who was yet but Young, and not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed to Men of Rough and Military Dispositions; yet, though he used great diligence to find out <hi>Douglas,</hi> to bring him to Condign Punishment; he, by Means of his Friends,<note place="margin">

Upon which Account, he was not only pardoned, but preferred also to the Government of <hi>Rox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi> and of <hi>Teviotdale</hi> too; a Clemency, which, perhaps, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Circumstances of Things, might be useful; but, certainly, of very ill Example for the Future.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>David,</hi> having thus settled Matters at Home, the best he could, denounces War against <hi>England,</hi> the greatest Part of the Nobility dissuading him from that Expedition,<note place="margin">

This Army, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving wasted <hi>Northumberland</hi> for about Two Months time, returned home with great Booty: Within a few Days after, he made another Inrode into the Enemies Country; but then he did not disguise, but openly professed Himself, both King and General. The <hi>English,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inferior in Strength, would not venture to give a set Battel, whilst their King was absent in <hi>France</hi>; but skirmished their Enemies with their Horse, and so kept them from plundering much, by a close March.
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:56771:160"/>
Five of the Chief Nobility, whom <hi>David</hi> had lately raised to that Honour, straggling too far from their Men, were taken Prisoners, their Followers being also killed, or put to Flight. So that, <hi>David,</hi> to spend no more time there, in vain, returned with his Army. He made also a Third Expedition, with what Force he could privately Levy, that so he might fall upon his Enemy, unawares. But, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring <hi>England</hi> in a stormy <hi>Autumn,</hi> the small Brooks were so swollen with large Showres, that they made all the Country unpassable, and also hinder'd the Carriage of Provision, so that, Home he came again; yet, that he might not seem to have taken so much Pains to no purpose, he demolished a few Castles.</p>
               <p>Not long after, Embassadors were sent, to and fro, in order to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a Truce for Two Years, which the <hi>Scots</hi> consented to, upon Condition, That <hi>Philip,</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> gave his Consent; for That was one Article in the Treaty between the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> That neither of them should make Truce, or Peace, with the <hi>English,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Other's Consent.<note place="margin">A Truce for two Years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>English.

Hereupon, an Army was commanded to meet at <hi>Perth.</hi> Thither they came in a great Abundance, and there <hi>David,</hi> Earl of <hi>Rosse,</hi> waylaying <hi>Reginald,</hi> Lord of the <hi>Aebudae,</hi> his Old Enemy, fell upon him in the Night,<note place="margin">See <hi>p.</hi> 4. <hi>Note</hi> i.</note> and slew him with Seven Nobles in his Company. This Murder did much weaken the Army, for the Kindred and Tenants of both Parties, yea, the Neighbouring Inhabitants, fearing a Civil War between Two such Potent Families, returned to their own Homes. And therefore, <hi>William Douglas</hi> of <hi>Liddisdale,</hi> earnestly persuaded the <hi>King</hi> to desist from his present Expedition, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose Matters, at Home. His Counsel was refused; and the King (his Friendship to <hi>Philip</hi> overcoming his Love to his Country) marches forward into <hi>England,</hi> and destroyed all as he went, by Fire and Sword.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>David</hi> at the solicitation of the <hi>French,</hi> enters <hi>England</hi> with an Army.</note> And thus in Sixteen Days he came into the County of <hi>Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> where the <hi>English,</hi> parly levied by <hi>Percy,</hi> and partly sent back from the Siege of <hi>Calais,</hi> made a great Body, and shewed themselves to the Enemy in Battel-array, sooner than ever the <hi>Scots</hi> could have imagined. <hi>David,</hi> who feared nothing less than the coming of the Enemy, and therefore had sent abroad <hi>Douglas</hi> to forage the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Country, gave a Signal of Battel to his Souldiers. <hi>Douglas</hi> fell unawares amongst his Enemies, and having lost Five Hundred of his Men, was put to slight, and returned, in great Fear, to the Camp. And the End of the Conflict was as unhappy, as the Beginning: For, the Fight being sharply begun, <hi>Iohn Randolfe</hi>'s Men were routed at the first Onset, and he himself slain.

But this was done some Years after.</p>
               <p>The King spent the next Five Years in appeasing the Discords at home, in which time there happened Two great Calamities: One reached but to a few, by an Inundation of Water; for, the Heavens sent down so much Rain, that <hi>Lothian</hi> seemed to be all a Float; yea,<note place="margin">Great Inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Water endammage <hi>Lothian.</hi>

This Misery was seconded by Another, namely, a grievous Pestilence,<note place="margin">A Grievous Pestilence.</note> which consumed many of all Ranks and Ages.</p>

But he, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding their Fears, abated his Anger, and received them into Favour. When he had quieted all things elsewhere, yet the <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> continued still in Arms, and did not only commit Outrages upon one another, but also made Havock of the adjacent Countries.

                  </note> To suborn some Crafty Fellows, to foment and heighten their Dissensions; that so, when the feircest of them had destroyed one another, the rest might become more Tractable and Pliant.

                  </note> He, then perceiving the long Train of the <hi>English</hi> in their March, quickly turned to be of his Opinion.

But those, who knew the Ways better, through which they were to march, replyed on the contrary, That there would be great difficulty in passing over such Marshes and Mountains, and sometimes narrow Places, wherein there was also so much want of all things, that a very few Men, and those nimble ones too, could carry Provisions enough with them, thÃ´ but for a few days, to finish the March; and besides, if they should overcome those Difficulties, yet the next Country, which was to receive them, was not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitful of itself; and also, it had been wasted by the War. Again, if they should wade through all those Inconveniencies, yet they had to do with a nimble and shifting Enemy, whom it would be more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to find, and to bring to a Battel, than to <hi>overcome</hi>; and, if they could find him out, yet he would not be compelled to Fight, but in his own Places of Advantage: That <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father, had Experience hereof, to the great Damage of his <hi>Own,</hi> and little Inconvenience of the <hi>Scots</hi> Army. Upon Hearing of this, as also casting in their Minds, what Miseries they might suffer in an Enemies Country,<note place="margin">They both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn home.</note> in a cold Winter; and in the mean time, leave their Wives, Children, and what else was dear to them, desolate at home; they changed their Minds, and marched back directly the same way, that they came. Thus both Armies had a free Time of plundering in their Enemies Country; and each of them returned home again, without seeing any Enemy.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Scots,</hi> well knowing, That the <hi>English</hi> could not attempt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Expedition till the next Summer, resolved to attack <hi>Roxburgh,</hi> a Neighbour Town, and the Garison there, which was greatly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyous to the Country thereabout.

<pb n="313" facs="tcp:56771:165"/>
remain under the Jurisdiction of <hi>France.</hi> On the contrary, the <hi>Scots</hi> urged, That it was very unjust, That Auxiliaries should reap the Reward and Benefit of the whole War; and for what Expences they had been at, it had been spent rather on Themselves than the <hi>Scots,</hi> it being in order to distract and divide the Forces of <hi>England,</hi> and so to avert Part of the War from <hi>France</hi>; and if the Friendly Offices on Both sides were put in the Ballance, the <hi>Scots</hi> might, upon juster grounds, demand the Charge of the whole War of the <hi>French,</hi> than the <hi>French</hi> could challenge any Reward for their Assistance, especially such a Reward, as no History, in the Memory of Man, doth relate either to have been demanded, or given, by Allys one to, or amongst, another: Yea, The Unjustness of their Demand appeared by This, That the <hi>Scots</hi> might have sate still in Peace, without being prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the <hi>English</hi>; and so might have been Spectators only of the Wars betwixt Two potent Kings; but the <hi>French</hi> could not have Obtained the same Quiet, unless they would have yielded up a good Part of their Country. Neither could they see, of what use that Town would be to the <hi>French,</hi> if they had it, save only to be as a Bridle; that so the Arbitrement of War or Peace might be at their dispose; and if That were their intent, it were more for the Profit, yea, and for the Credit too, of the Kings of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to be without the Town, than, on a Trivial occasion, to give up Themselves to a voluntary Servitude: But, if by so unequal a Postulation, they thought to excuse their Return home, which they sometime before attempted, there was no need at all of such a <hi>Blind,</hi> for as they freely came, so they had Liberty always, at their pleasure, freely to depart; neither was it adviseable in the <hi>Scots</hi> to stay Them; in regard they might easily foresee, their Service would be but small, if they were detained against their Wills.</p>
               <p>Hereupon, They retreated from <hi>Roxburgh</hi> without attaquing it; and, whereas there had grievous Complaints been made betwixt Both Parties, before; so, (if matters should still continue at that Pass) open Enmity did seem likely to arise.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>French</hi> Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers more licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious than <hi>Scots,</hi> or <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,</hi> which occasions a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust betwixt them.</note> The Original of the Dissension arose from the different Custom and Carriage of either Nation, in managing of a War. For the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>English</hi> Soldiers pay honestly for what they take at their Quarters, and carry it amongst their Countrymen, as moderately and soberly in War, as in Peace. But the <hi>French</hi> otherwise; where-ever they march, <hi>All's their Own,</hi> as if they had publick Permission to Rob and Spoil; for, they, having been accustomed to this kind of Life, think, they might lawfully do That, which Custom hath inured them always to do, heretofore: And therefore, before that time, there had often Quarrels, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Blows, happened betwixt the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>French; These</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to practise their wonted Rapacity; and the <hi>Other</hi> not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to such an unaccustomed Servility; so that as <hi>One</hi> snatcht away what was none of His; the <hi>Other</hi> laboured to defend his Own. After this Disgust and Alienation of Minds at <hi>Roxburgh,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Commissaries used greater Licentiousness than ever before, in gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Provisions, as intending shortly to depart; and the Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, disdaining to be made a Prey to a Few men, and those Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, too, many times took away their Baggage and their Horses;

                  </note> would assault a greater Number of his Enemies, and come off a Conquerour; Neither was he ever employed in any Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, but he gave evident Proofs of his Valour. These Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies, which, in some, are matter of Envy; yet, in him, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of his Affability, Complaisance and courteous Modesty, were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to All. And upon the account of those Virtues, tho' the King knew him to be Base-born, yet he bestowed his Daughter <hi>Aegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi> upon him, in Marriage, a Woman of the rarest Beauty in those Times; and one, who had been Courted by many of the Noblest Youngsters of the Court.

               <p>He Landed his Men at <hi>Carlingford,</hi> a rich Town in that County, and the Suddenness of the Thing struck such Terrour into the Towns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, That they presently sent out to him to Treat about Conditions of Surrender. <hi>Douglas</hi> entertained them courteously, and, in the mean time, as secure of the Enemy, he sent out <hi>Robert Stuart,</hi> Laird of <note n="*" place="margin">A Town on the North side of the <hi>Nith,</hi> a Mile about <hi>Drumlanerick</hi> in <hi>Nithisdale.</hi>

To heal this Mischief, he transfer'd the Government of the Provinces, and the management of Lesser Matters (as is usually done in such Cases) from one to another; and by this means, the Fire of Hatred was not so much quenched, as covered in the Ashes, and likely soon after to break out, again: But, on the the contrary, <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> enjoyed a Great, but yet uncertain, Tranquillity. For it was full of Young Soldiers, fit for War, and as fruitful and well-stored with good Commanders, as ever before. So that, the Nobility were desirous of a War, and, in all their Assemblys and Meetings, they still muttered, That so gallant an Opportunity to be revenged upon the <hi>English</hi> for their old Injuries, was not to be neglected, and that the <hi>English</hi> would never have omitted it, in reference to <hi>Scotland,</hi> if the Affairs thereof had been in the like Perturbation.</p>
               <p>But King <hi>Robert,</hi> being a Man of a quiet Disposition; and, more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, by reason of his growing and unweildy Age,<note place="margin">Against the mind of <hi>Robert</hi> and his Son.</note> not so forward for War, seemed not to be sufficiently concerned at the Publick Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: And his Eldest Son, <hi>Iohn,</hi> was naturally Slow, and, besides, Lame with the stroke of an Horse, so that he was not well able to endure the Hardships of a Camp. And therefore the Nobles made their Addresses to <hi>Robert,</hi> the next Son, Earl of <hi>Fife</hi>; To whom they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of the deplorable State of the Publick, and they all presently Concluded, That the wrong, lately received, was to be revenged, and therein every one promised his Chearful Assistance; so that it was agreed, That a Levy of Soldiers should be made against the <hi>Nones</hi> of <note place="margin">

               <p>But the <hi>English</hi> were quickly advertised by their Spies, of the Time and Place of Meeting; so that they resolved to prevent their Enemy with the same Surprize. For they advised the rest of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles with all their Followers to be in a readiness, not at any one day, but whenever there was need, that they might draw to their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours. Matters being thus resolved on, when they heard, That the <hi>Scots,</hi> to the Number of 30000, or, as <hi>Frossard</hi> will have it, of 40000, were met together in <hi>Teviotdale,</hi> nor far from the Borders; they resolved further, that (seeing they were not able to encounter so great a Multitude) they would attempt nothing before the Coming of the Enemy upon them. And in the mean time, to conceal their Project the better, every man was to stay at his own home, till they saw, upon what Country so great a Storm would fall; and then, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Enemies Motion, they would steer their Cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In the interim, they sent a Spy to inform themselves fully of the Enemies advance, who was now so near them; for they counted it highly conduceable to their affairs, to know, not only the Design,

Hereupon, the Matter began to be suspected, and when he was gone a great way, some Horsemen were sent after, to bring him back, as a Runagate; when they came up to him, and demanded, Who, or What he was, and Why he went from his Colours in that Fashion; he not being able to give a ready Answer, they brought him back to the chief Officers of the Army, to whom, for fear of a greater Punishment, he discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all the designs of the <hi>English.</hi> When the <hi>Scots</hi> heard this, they also changed the Order of their Designs,<note place="margin">The <hi>Scots</hi> Army divide themselves to attack <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>

                  </note> a Duel betwixt the Two Generals; for they, being, in a sort, equally matched, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of Lineage, Power, Age and Courage, had a mind to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter each other, in the Sight of both Armies.

But <hi>Douglas</hi> was minded to stay Two or Three Days in that Place, that so he might make a Real Confutation of the Vaunts of <hi>Percy,</hi> who had boasted, <hi>That they should never carry his Lance into</hi> Scotland. In the mean time, that they might not be idle, they would attaque the Neighbouring Castle. This Opinion, though it was judged by Many none of the best, yet, for <hi>Douglas</hi> his sake, they all submitted to it. And therefore they fortified their Camp for the present Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, which on one side was sufficiently guarded by Marishes, and and then proceeded on to take the Castle. But <hi>Percy</hi> being of a fierce Nature, that he might blot out the Ignominy he had received, would have followed him presently upon their Retreat, with those Forces which he had about him; but the Graver Sort detained him, for fear of an Ambush; for they did not think it probable, that so small a Number of <hi>Scots</hi> would have appeared before so strong a Town, unless they had more Forces, near at hand, hid in some secret Places. That Day and the next, they were busie in making Discoveries; but finding, that there was no Danger of the Greater Army, as being far distant from <hi>Douglas</hi> his Party, thereupon <hi>Percy</hi> immediately, with Ten Thousand Fighting Men, put himself upon the March, without staying for the Bishop of <hi>Durham,</hi> who, that very Night, was expected with some Forces; for, he thought, he had Force enough to overcome his Enemies, who were not half as many, as He. When the <hi>English</hi> came in Sight, some of the <hi>Scots</hi> were at Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; others, being wearied at the Taking of the Castle, had compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed themselves to Rest; but presently, an Alarming Word was given, <hi>To your Arms.</hi> Whilst the rest were arming themselves, the Major Part of the Foot, and many of the Horse-Mens Servants, making use of that slender Fortification they had, bore the Brunt of the <hi>English</hi>
                  <pb n="318" facs="tcp:56771:168"/>
Assault. But the Horse had a great Advantage, in that they were sensible of the thing, before; for, disputing among themselves, how they should entertain the Enemy when he assaulted them, (for, an Assault they expected) they saw, that a Neighbour Hill would be of great Conveniency to them. Thither therefore they Trooped about, and whilst the <hi>English</hi> were assaulting the Passage into the Camp, they fell in upon their left Flank, and made a great Slaughter, but a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Noise: Yet, the <hi>English,</hi> having Men enough, brought up their Reserves, and quickly made good their Ranks again; yet, that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order did this good to the <hi>Scots,</hi> That the Fight before the Camp was managed more remisly, so that they had Liberty to draw out, and Range their Army in order of Battel.</p>
               <p>Whilst these things were doing, the Night drew on, but it was a short one, as it useth to be in <hi>Iuly,</hi> in the <hi>Northern</hi> Countries espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, and the Weather also chanced to be fair; so that the Moon shining all Night, it was as bright as Day. The Fight was maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Gallantly,<note place="margin">A terrible Fight between the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>English,</hi> under <hi>Percy</hi> and <hi>Douglas.</hi>
                  </note> as between Two Noble Champions, who were more solicitous for their Honour, than for their Lives. <hi>Percy</hi> endeavoured to redeem his Credit, and <hi>Douglas</hi> to maintain His, by a New At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievement; so that there was as much Eagerness on the one side, as on the other, though their Numbers were unequal, and so the Fight continued till it was late at Night. And then the Moon began to be Clouded, that <hi>Friend</hi> could not be discerned from <hi>Foe</hi>; whereupon, they rested a while, to take a little breath; and assoon as the Moon brake forth from the Clouds, the <hi>English</hi> pressed hard upon the <hi>Scots,</hi> so that they gave Ground, and <hi>Douglas</hi> his Standard was like to be lost. When the Two <hi>Patrick Hepburns,</hi> Father and Son, saw this, they hastned from the other Wing, and brake through the Ranks of their own Soldiers, and so pierced to the Front, where the main Danger was; and there they began so fierce an Assault, that they gave and received many Wounds; and in fine, brought back their Men to their former Ground, from whence they had been driven. Neither was <hi>Douglas</hi> content therewith, but with his Two Friends and Followers, <hi>Robert Hart,</hi> and <hi>Simon Glenduning</hi> his Kinsman, he rushed in amongst the midst of his Enemies, and being of a stout Spirit, as well as strong Body, made a great Slaughter wherever he came.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hart</hi> slain, And <hi>Douglas</hi> mortally Wounded.</note> His Friends strove earnestly to come up to him; yet, before they could do so, he was mortally Wounded in Three Places, and lay upon the Ground; <hi>Hart</hi> lay dead by him having a great many Wounds about him; and the Priest, who had accompanied him in all his Hazards, when he fainted, defended his Body from Injury. In this Condition, <hi>Iohn Lindsay,</hi> and the Two <hi>Sinclares, Iohn</hi> and <hi>Walter,</hi> found him, and asked him, <hi>How he did? Very well,</hi> said he, <hi>for I am a Dying, yet I do not Die like a Sluggard, upon my Bed, but as almost all my Ancestors have done;</hi>

Whereupon, they in the First place, covered his Body with a Cloak, that it might not be known, and then they set up his Standard, and cried out, (as the

Whereupon he returned into the Town, and advised with his Tenants concerning his Following the <hi>Scots.</hi> The Resolve was, That before Day-Break, they should all be in Arms; and so, in the morning, there were Ten thousand Horse and Foot from the Neighbouring Places, a promiscuous mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, which came in. They encouraged the Bishop to march the
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:56771:169"/>
nearest way to the Enemy, and to give him Battel, alleging, That He was so wearied with his yesterdays Fight, and so many were wounded, and the rest secure by reason of their late Victory, that he might obtain an easie Conquest over them. The Earl of <hi>Murray,</hi> upon whom the Eyes of all were fixed, when <hi>Douglas</hi> was gone, was advertised of his coming by his Scouts, whereupon he consulted with his Chief Commanders about the Prisoners; To kill them, in cold Blood, after they had given them Quarter, seemed cruel; and to save alive a number of Enemies, almost equal with their own, seemed dangerous. The Resolve was, That they should all Swear not to stir, whilst the Battel was fought, and though their Friends might relieve them, yet they should continue and own themselves as Prisoners, still; Upon these Terms, they were left in the Camp with a small Guard, who were commanded to fall upon them all, if any one did stir. This Matter thus setled, the <hi>Scots,</hi> being full of Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, by reason of their Former Victory, marched out with their Army, being fortified and secured in the Rear with Marshes, and, on the Right and Left, with Trees which they cut down; and moreover, the Word of Command was given,<note place="margin">The <hi>Bishops</hi> Forces terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the Sound of Horns, and Retreat.</note> That as soon as the Enemy drew near, every Man should blow his Horn, which he carried behind him at his Back, which would make such a mighty Noise and Sound as was terrible of it self; but, being multiplied by the Repercussion and Eccho of the Neighbouring Hills, gave forth the Representation of a Greater Force, than indeed they were. The <hi>English</hi> had march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very fast, and moreover were to fight amongst the dead Bodies of their own Men, being astonished at that horrible Noise, and also at the Alacrity of their Enemies, who stood in good Order over against them; and besides, having no Skilful Commander over so tumultuary a Body, and also the Commander not much confiding on such a Raw Soldiery, they presently turned their Colours, and marched back, as they came.<note place="margin">

               <p>The Excellency of this <hi>Robert,</hi> was, That he rather wanted Vice, than was Illustrious for any Virtue; so that the Name of King was in him, but the management of all publick Affairs rested on <hi>Robert,</hi> his Brother. In the Beginning of his Reign, there was Peace abroad, by reason of the Three Years Truce, made with the <hi>English</hi>; which, a while after, was enlarged for Four Years more. But at home, a Sedition was begun, by <hi>Duncan,</hi> or <hi>Dunach, Stuart.</hi> He was the Son of <hi>Alexander,</hi> Earl of <hi>Buchan,</hi> the Kings Brother;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Duncan Stuart</hi> rises in Arms but is suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</note> and was every jot as feirce, as his Father; who, upon the Death of his Grandfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, imagining now, that he had a fit opportunity for Rapine and Pillage, got a Band of Roisters about him, and, descending into <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi> spoiled all, as if it had been an Enemies Country. <hi>Walter Ogilby,</hi> and <hi>Walter Lichton</hi> his Brother, endeavouring to oppose him, were slain, with Sixty of their Followers. They being lifted up with this Success, did afflict the Country more grievously than ever; but hearing of the approach of the Earl of <hi>Crawford,</hi> whom the King had sent to restrain their Insolence, the nimblest of them fled speedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to their lurking Holes; of those who made not so much hast, some were slain, some taken, and afterwards put to Death. Thus the Wickedness of these Unquiet and Turbulent Men, being hindred from breaking in upon the Plain and Champion Countries, they fell out most grievously amongst Themselves, at their own homes. And es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially, Two Families of them did exercise great Rage and Cruelty, one upon another. They refused to end their Fewds by course of Law; or, to refer them to indifferent Arbitrators. So that the King sent Two Earls to suppress them, <hi>Thomas</hi> Earl of <hi>Dunbar,</hi> and <hi>Iames Lindsay,</hi> his Father being Dead, now Earl of <hi>Crawford</hi>: These Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, considering they were to engage against a feirce and reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute People, who valued not their Lives, nor the Pleasure thereof; so that they were not likely to subdue them by force, without great Slaughter of their own Men; they therefore resolved to try what they could do by Policy. And thereupon, they accosted the <hi>Clans</hi> of both Families a part, and represented to them, what danger would
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:56771:171"/>
accru to Both, by their mutual Slaughters one of another; and if one Family should extirpate the other; yet, that was not likely to be effected, without the Great Damage, even of the Conquering Side; and if either Party should prevail, yet the Contest would not end so;<note place="margin">A notable Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy to divide the Islanders, and make them Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which takes effect accordingly.</note> For then they were to engage the King's Forces, (tho' they were weakned before by their mutual Conflicts) of whose Anger against them Both, they might be justly sensible, because he had sent them with Forces to destroy them Both, even before they had severe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and irrecoverably, engaged against one another. But in regard, they were more desirous of their Preservation than their Ruin, if they would hearken to them, they would shew them a Way, How they might be reconciled, with the King's good Liking, and that on no dishonourable Terms, neither; no, nor unrevenged one upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, To this Motion they seemed inclinable, so that the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was proposed; That 300 of each side should Try it out in Fight before the King, Armed only with their Swords. They that were Conquered, should have an Amnesty for all past Offences, and the Conquerors should be Honoured with the King's Favour, and the Nobles, too. Both sides were well pleased with the Terms; so that a day was fixed for the Combate, and at the time appointed, the Heads of the Families, with their Parties, came to Court, and part of a Field, on the North side of the Town of <hi>Perth,</hi> which was severed from the rest, by a deep Trench, was appointed for the place of Combate; and Galleries built round for Spectators. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, an huge Multitude was Assembled together, and sate ready to see the Dispute; but the Fight was delayed awhile, because one of the 300, of the One Party, had hid himself for Fear, and their Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows were not willing to engage without having just an equal num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber with their Adversaries; neither was any one found to supply the Place of him who was absent; And of the other Party, not a Man would be drawn out, or exempted from the Fight, lest he might seem less valued, and not so couragious as the rest. After a little pause, an ordinary Tradesman comes forth, and offers to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the Place of him, that was absent, Provided, That if his Side Conquered, they would pay him halfe a <hi>Gold Dollar</hi> of <hi>France</hi>; and also, provide for him afterward, as long as he lived. Thus, the Number being again equalled, the Fight began, and it was carried on with such great Contention, both of Body and Mind, as old Grudges, inflamed by new Losses, could raise up in Men of such fierce Dispositions, as were accustomed to Blood and Cruelty; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, seeing Honour and Estate was propounded to the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror; Death and Ignominy, to the Conquered: The Spectators were possessed with as much Horror, as the Combatants were with Fury, as detesting to behold the ugly and deformed Mutilations, and But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheries, of one anothers Bodies; the Detruncation of their Limbs; and, in a word, the Rage of Wild Beasts, under the shape of Men. But all took notice, that none carried himself more valiantly, than that Mercenary and Supposititious Hireling, to whose Valour a great Part of the Victory was to be ascribed: Of that Side that he was of, there were Ten left alive, besides himself, but all of them grievously wounded: Of the contrary Faction, there remained only One, who
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:56771:171"/>
was not wounded at all; but, seeing there was so much odds, that he alone must encounter with so many, he cast himself into the River <hi>Tay,</hi> which was near at hand; and in regard, his Adversaries were not able to follow him, by reason of their Wounds, he escaped to the other Side. By this means, the forwardest of Both Parties be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing slain, the promiscuous Multitude, being left without Leaders, left off their Trade of Seditioning, for many Years after, and betook themselves to their Husbandry, again. This Fight, or Combat, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in the Year 1396.</p>
               <p>About Two Years after, in an Assembly of the States at <hi>Perth,</hi> the King made <hi>David</hi> his Son, being 18 Years before old of <hi>Rothes,</hi> and <hi>Robert</hi> his Brother Earl of <hi>Menteith,</hi> and <hi>Fife</hi> Dukes of <hi>Albany.</hi> This vain Title of Honour then was first Celebrated in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> a great increase to Ambition, but none at all to Virtue; neither did it afterwards thrive with any, who enjoyed it. The King would have bestowed the same Title of Honour upon the Earl of <hi>Douglas</hi> also; but he being a grave and solid Person,<note place="margin">Dukes First made in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                  </note> absolutely refused that nominal Shadow of empty Honour; and if any Man told thim, that he should be a Duke, he rebuked him sharply for it: Some say, That the Name of Governour, which was given by his Father to <hi>Robert</hi> the Kings Brother, was this Year confirmed by the King<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>

                  <hi>George</hi> was much affected at this Injury, as well as Reproach, and made great complaint to the King; but, seeing what was once done, could not be undone, he desired, at least, the repayment of the Dowry. This his just De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand being denied, and perceiving, that he was not like to obtain any Right, in regard the Minds and Ears of all the Court were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possessed by his Rival, he departed upon very angry, yea, threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Terms, and so giving up the Castle of <hi>Dunbar</hi> to <hi>Robert Mait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> his Sisters Son, he went for <hi>England. Robert</hi> presently yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up the Castle to an Herald, sent by the King to demand it, and <hi>Douglas</hi> was admitted into it with a Garison, so that when <hi>George</hi> returned home, he was denied entrance. Hereupon, he took his Wife, Children, and some intimate Friends, and returned into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> Being there, as he was a Man powerful at home, and famous
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:56771:172"/>
abroad, he joyned Counsels with <hi>Percy,</hi> a mortal Enemy to the name of the <hi>Douglas</hi>'s; and in regard, he was well beloved by the border<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Scots,</hi> of which, many were either his Tenants, Allies, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise obliged to him,<note place="margin">

                  </note> he made an Inroad into the whole Province of <hi>Merch,</hi> and drove great Preys from the Country, especially from the Lands of the <hi>Douglasses.</hi> The King of <hi>Scots</hi> first proclaimed <hi>George</hi> a Publick Enemy, and confiscated all his Estate; next, he sent an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rald to <hi>England,</hi> to Demand, That he might be given up as a Fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, according to the League made betwixt them; and also to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of the violation of the Truce. <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>England</hi> gave a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory Answer to his Demands, That he had given the Publick Faith to <hi>George</hi> for his Protection, and that he would not break his Royal Word; as if a private Pact with a Runagate were more Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiously to be observed, than That which had been publickly confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by Embassadors and Heralds; for the Days of the Truce made with <hi>Richard,</hi> were not yet expired. In the mean time, <hi>Henry Percy,</hi> the Younger, called <hi>Hot-Spur,</hi> and <hi>George Dunbar</hi> ceased not to infest the Neighbouring Lands of the <hi>Scots</hi> with their Incursions. Which when they had often and successfully done, their Boldness encreased with their Success; so that, gathering 2000 Men together, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred <hi>Lothian,</hi> and made great havock about <hi>Hadington.</hi> They be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged <note place="margin">Standing upon <hi>Tine,</hi> 3 Miles below <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dington.</hi>

               <p>The same Year, upon the return of the Herald, War was denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced against <hi>England,</hi> and then also <hi>Archibald Douglas,</hi> Sirnamed the <hi>Austere,</hi>

So that their Loss he counted his Gain. But the King of <hi>England,</hi> and his Army, on the contrary, did Exercise their Enmity very moderately; as if, by an Ostentation of War,<note place="margin">Carries it Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately,</note> they had only sought for Peace; for, having made some sleight Onset on the Castle, he raised the Siege, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned home, without doing any considerable damage to the Places, thro' which he marched; insomuch, that, in his Marches both back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and forward, he got the Praise and Commendation of a mild, clement, and moderate Enemy; he was courteous to Those<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> that

All which did more ingratiate Him, and render the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor more odious; in regard he did not prosecute the War with any Eagerness, as against an Enemy; nor yet, endeavour to make so easy and beneficent a King, his Friend. After <hi>Henry</hi> was returned for <hi>England, George Dunbar</hi> did still trouble the Borders rather with frequent, than great, Inroads. To suppress him, there was more need of a diligent, than numerous, Force, and therefore <hi>Douglas</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the Forces of each County into small Bands, and appointed Commanders over them; who, by turns, were to stop the Enemy; or, if they saw cause, to Fight him.

This Dejection of spirit proceeded, not so much from Fear of the Enemy, as from the Perfidiousness of the Governor, who gaped for the Kingdom.

Hereupon, he gathered some of his Friends and Tenants about him, and prepared himself for the Fight, wherein he behaved himself as stoutly, as he promised to <hi>Percy</hi>; so that, without regard to the Common Soldiers, his Mind, and Eye, was wholly intent upon the King only; and, in regard, there were several Commanders cloathed in Royal attire, which was done on purpose by the <hi>English,</hi> either to deceive the Enemy, if they should press hard upon him; or else, that the Soldiers, in more places than one, might find him a present witness of their Courageousness or Cowardize: <hi>Douglas</hi> took notice of One of these, who had Gallant Armour, and rushed in upon him, with all his might, and so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horsed him. But he, being relieved by those who were next, he did the same to a Second, and a Third, who were all attired as Kings, (thus <hi>Edward Hall,</hi> the <hi>English</hi> Writer affirms, as well as Ours) so that he was not taken up so much with the Apprehension of his own danger, as with a wonderment,<note place="margin">Having Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly in a fight he is taken Prisoner, and after ransomed</note> from whence so many Kings should start up, at once.

               <p>In the interim, the King advised with his Friends, how he might preserve <hi>Iames,</hi> his Youngest Son, for whose safety he was very soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous, and whom he had left in the custody of <hi>Walter Wardiloe,</hi> Arch-Bishop of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> an honest man and faithful to him; They gave their Opinion in the case, that he could not be safe in any part of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and that therefore it was best to send him over to <hi>Charles</hi> the IV.

                  <hi>Murdo</hi> being set up, as I said but now, in the place of his Father, he maintained a very loose Discipline in his own House, his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren (whose Names were <hi>Walter, Alexander,</hi> and <hi>Iames</hi>) did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise their Inferiors, and consequently oppress them with many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, and they infected the Youth, with those Vices, to which they themselves were addicted;<note place="margin">Fond Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, justly punished in a Father.</note> and seeing their Father did not curb nor restrain them, at last he was punished himself for giving them such bad Education. The old Man did highly prize a certain Bird he had, of that sort of <hi>Hawks,</hi> which they call <hi>Falcons: Walter</hi> had often begg'd him of his Father, and was as often denied; so that upon a time, he catched it out of his Fathers Hand, and wrung off his Neck. To whom his Father replied, <hi>Because thou can'st not find in thy Heart to obey me, I will bring in another, That both thou and I too shall be forced to obey.</hi> And, from that time forward, he bent his Thoughts to restore his Kinsman <hi>Iames</hi>; and there was an Eminent Man of <hi>Argile,</hi> chief of the Country, named <hi>Calen Cambel,</hi> whom, before, <hi>Walter</hi> had affronted and wronged, who approved of his Design herein; so that, he assembled the Estates at <hi>Perth,</hi> and a Consulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being had concerning the Revocation of their King; They all, either out of Favour to the true Heir of the Kingdom, or out of Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riness of the present posture of Affairs, willingly agreed to send an Embassy about his Restitution:<note place="margin">The <hi>Scots</hi> send for King <hi>Iames</hi> the First, out of <hi>England.</hi>

advantage of him, That he would not only be his sure and fast Friend, but would always be under the power and influence of <hi>England,</hi> for he had Married <hi>Ioan,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Salisbury</hi>'s Daughter, the Beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullest Woman of her Time, (which he then was mightily in Love with) he persuaded himself, that, by her means, the League with <hi>France</hi> might be easily undermined; and, if he were freed, either he would be obliged by that Courtesy; or else, whilst he was busie in revenging the Wrongs his Kindred had done him, he would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle his Country in a grievous intestine War; and, by this means, it would come to pass, That either the <hi>English</hi> would be made stronger by the Accession of such a Friend; or, if their <hi>Scotish</hi> Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies disagreed amongst themselves; yet, they should be more disin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, and readier for a Foreign War. And, indeed, these were no imprudent Considerations, if they themselves, by the Narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their Spirits, had not marred their own Market. For seeing they demanded a greater Sum of Money, for his Redemption, than the <hi>Scots,</hi> in their present Circumstances, either durst promise, or were able to pay,<note place="margin">Who returns upon a Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som.</note> a Compremize was made, That the Dowry of his Wife should be retained, as for One half, and that the Sons of some Noblemen should be given in Hostage, for the payment of the Other. <hi>Iames,</hi> being set at Liberty upon these Terms, returned home, 18 years after he had been a Prisoner, in the year of our <hi>Lord</hi> 1423.</p>
               <p>Amidst the great Concourse of People, which flocked in, to see him, and to Congratulate his Return, he was soon entertained with the Complaint of those who grievously lamented, what Wrongs they had sustained since the last Kings Death, partly by the Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and partly by the Injuries of the late Governors: <hi>Walter,</hi> the Son of <hi>Murdo, Malcolm Fleming,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Boyd,</hi> were highly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused, who, to pacifie the Commons for the present, were committed to several Prisons, until the next Convention of the Estates, which was appointed to be the Sixth of the <hi>Calends</hi> of <hi>Iune.</hi>

But he was so far from being thankful to the King for his Pardon, and afterwards for his Liberty, that, he thought, he had Great wrong done him, that he was kept some days in Prison. And therefore, as soon as he was returned to his old Comrades, he gathered a Company of Them together, who were accustomed to live upon the Spoil, and went to <hi>Innerness,</hi> in a seemingly peaceable manner; where being hospitably entertained, he suffered his Followers to pillage the Town, and after he had set fire to the Houses, he laid Siege to the Castle; but, hearing of a Force coming against him, was compelled to raise his Siege, and march in great haste to <hi>Loch-Abyr.</hi> There, by reason of the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of the Place, he resolves to put himself upon the Fortune of a Battel, with that Army which he had with him, which were 10000 men, hardned to the Wars.

the wrath of the King, he thought it best to fly to his last Refuge, <hi>viz.</hi> the Kings Mercy and Clemency; which, before, he had so large experience of: But here his Thoughts were at a loss betwixt Hope and Fear; when he considered, what Mischiefs he had done at his first Revolt; and, after the King had graciously pardoned him, with what perfidiousness and cruelty he had again broke forth, and so had cut off all hopes of further Indemnity; and, therefore was in great Doubt and Perplexity, whether he would commit himself, his Life and Fortunes to the Kings Anger, so justly conceived against him. In these Circumstances, he resolved to take a middle Course, between Flight and Surrendring himself, which was, to send Agents to Court, to beg Pardon for his Offences; and to incline the Kings Heart to Lenity towards him. And, for this Service, he chose quiet, moderate, Men, and not at all infected with the same contagious Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies, whereof he himself was Guilty; and on that account, not unacceptable to the King; yet notwithstanding, they could obtain no other Answer from him, but That he would hear nothing unless he would put himself into his hands; neither would he Treat with him, as long as he was absent. <hi>Alexander</hi> cast up all his dangers in his mind, and foreseeing, that he could be safe no where from the Kings Fury, resolved to choose a fit Time and Place, and so to cast himself upon him; for, he thought, he would count it a shame to injure, or punish, an humble Supplicant. Whereupon he comes pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> where the King then was, and on the day where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our <note n="*" place="margin">

His Habit, the Place and Time, and so great and sudden a Change of Fortune, did much affect the By-stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. The Queen and the Nobles, who were present, interceded with the King for him, and did so far incline and affect his Mind, That they were commanded to stay, till their Devotions were ended. In the Interim, the King pondered every thing with himself, and thought it not safe to dismiss so perfidious, potent, and Factious a Person, without any Punishment at all; and yet, on the other side, to make some Gratification to the Request of the Queen, he thought it best to keep him alive, in safe Custody; for, by this means, he might gain an Opinion of Clemency; and also prevent his opportunity to do further Mischief; provide for the security of the Common People; and withal terrify others by his Example. Hereupon he was sent Prisoner to <hi>Tintallon</hi>-Castle, and his Mother, a fierce Woman, was Banished into the Isle of <hi>Inch-colm.</hi> For it was thought, That she would have excited him to new Attempts.</p>

                        </gap>ck</hi> makes an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection.</note> To quell this Insurrection, <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Alan,</hi> both <hi>Stuarts</hi>; One Earl of <hi>Caith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> the Other of <hi>Marr,</hi> gathered some of their Countrymen toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and went into <hi>Loch-Abyr</hi> to meet <hi>Donald,</hi> (for the Report was, that he would make his descent there) where they waited his Coming. He, perceiving that they kept no Order, but were without Tents or Guard, in the Fourth Watch landed his men without any Noise, and so set upon them unexpectedly whilst they were half a sleep, and made a great slaughter amongst them. <hi>Alan,</hi> with almost all his Brigade, was lost there; and <hi>Alexander,</hi> with a Few, saved his Life by Flight. <hi>Donald</hi> was exalted with this Success, and so wasted all <hi>Loch-Abyr,</hi> with Fire and Sword, no man daring to oppose him; but, at length, hearing, That the King was making towards him with a greater Force, he trussed up his large bundles of Pillage, sent them a Shipboard, and returned into the <hi>Aebudae.</hi> The King marched as far as <hi>Dunstafnage</hi> after him, and there saw the ruin and fearful devastation which had been made; whereupon he conceived great wrath in his Breast, and was about to pass over into the <hi>Islands</hi>; but the Chiefs of their Families came with their humble Supplications to him, alleging, That there was no general guilt in the Case,<note place="margin">But is quelled.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause nothing had been acted by publick Advice, but all the fault lay at <hi>Alexanders</hi> own door, and of some indigent and lewd Persons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, that sided with him. The King answered, he would not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of their Excuse, unless they would apprehend the Authors of those wicked Pranks, and deliver them up to him to be punished; when they had promised to do their endeavour therein, the King let some of them go, to find out the Thieves; the rest he kept in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Hostages: Those, who were dismissed slew many of the Thieves, and brought 300 of them Prisoners to the King, (<hi>Donald</hi> himself, for fear of Punishment, being fled away) who caused them all to be hanged.</p>
               <p>This punishment of the Robbers, tho' for the present, it made things a little more quiet in the <hi>Aebudae,</hi> and the Neighbouring Parts; yet, the unquiet dispositions of some wicked and turbulent Persons would not suffer that Calm to be long-lived. The King, at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of his Nobles, had released Two of the <hi>Augus's, Duffus,</hi> and <hi>Murdo,</hi> Commanders of the Thieves. These turned their Fury up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one another,<note place="margin">Tories fall out among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</note> meeting in equal Numbers (for each of them main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained about 1500 Partisans, out of the Rapines of the People.) They fought so obstinately, that there was scarce any one left, on either side, to be Messengers of the Slaughter made; for 'tis said, that, on the one side there were but Twelve, on the other but Nine left alive; so that the King, who was equally Angry with Both, had scarce any left of them to inflict Punishment upon.</p>
               <p>And yet their Calamity did not restrain one <hi>Macdonald</hi> from his wonted Fierceness. He was a noted Robber, born in <hi>Ross,</hi> whose wicked Disposition was excited by the Impunity of the Former Times; so that he, (as we say) play'd <hi>Rex,</hi> along time,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mackdonald</hi> a Free-booter.</note> among his Neighbours. Amongst the rest, they say, he committed one Fact, superlatively Cruel. A Widow-woman being robbed by him,
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:56771:181"/>
grievously bemoaned her Case, and ever and anon cryed out, that she would complain to the King; Wilt thou so, says he? Then to the intent thou mayst better compass thy Journy, I my self will assist thee,<note place="margin">His Cruelty to a Woman,</note> and so calling a Smith, he caused him to nail Horse-shoes to the Soles of her Feet, and, not contented with that wrong, he added also contumelious and jeering words, telling her, now that she was more fenced against the roughness of the ways, and, in a mockery, he shewed her thus shod to those that passed by. The Woman be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a fierce and stern disposition, and rather enraged than terrified by his Reproaches, as soon as she was able to go, went to the King, and declared to him the Matter of Fact. The King had heard of the same, before, by others; and he having then the Authors in Prison, bid the Woman be of good chear; for she should speedily see the same Punishment inflicted on the Inventors of it; and hereupon, he caused <hi>Mackdonald,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Retaliated on himself and his Followers.</note> and Twelve of his Complices, to be brought out of Prison, and to have their Feet shod with Iron-Nails, and so to be carried Three days about the City, a <hi>Cryer</hi> going before, and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Cause of this new Punishment; then the Captain was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed, and his Twelve Associates hanged, all their Bodies being set upon Gibbets in the High-ways.</p>
               <p>These new Crimes, which a Pardon, once obtained, had not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, made the King more eager to find out <hi>Donald</hi> the Islander. And therefore, being informed that he lay concealed in a Noblemans House in <hi>Ireland,</hi> he sent Messengers to him to give him up to Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, the Nobleman fearing, that if he should send him away alive, thro' so long a Tract both by Land and Sea, he might possibly make an escape, and then his Maligners might allege, that it was done by his Connivence,<note place="margin">

                  </note> caused him to be slain, and sent his Head to the King by his own Messenger. Open Robberies being thus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently suppressed, the King endeavoured to extirpate some hidden Crimes and evil Customs;<note place="margin">The King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms Publick Manners.</note> and to accomplish this Work; he made choice of eminent Persons, much commended for their Prudence and Sanctity, giving them Power to Travel all over the Kingdom, to hear Complaints; and if their were any Offences complained of to them, which ordinary Judges, either for Fear durst not, or for Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and Affection would not,<note place="margin">He also recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies Weights and Measures.</note> intermeddle with, then They them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves should hear the Case, and determine it. And moreover, he added to them, One, who was to correct and rectify Weights and Measures, a Thing very necessary; seeing, then, not only every City, but almost every House, used a different kind of measure; In a Parliament he made wholesome Laws to this purpose, and caused Iron Measures to be set up in certain Places, and sent out one to all Markets and Fairs, who was to regulate all the Measures according to that Standard, and a grievous Punishment was denounced on him, who used any other Measure, than That which was publickly thus Signed and Marked.</p>
               <p>Whilst he was Transacting these things for the Publick Good, in the year 1430. the Fourteenth day of <hi>October,</hi> his Queen was brought a Bed of Twins;<note place="margin">His Queen brings forth Twins.</note> and thereupon a publick Rejoycing was made, and the King, to add something to the Popular Mirth, forgave for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Offences to some Noblemen, the Chief whereof, were, <hi>Archibald

Whereupon he resolved to prevent their Tyranny the Best and Onely way he was able; for, seeing it was not in his power to amend what was past; nor to Out unworthy Men of those Preferments which they once enjoyed; he thought to provide the best he could for the Future, which was, to set up publick Schools for Learning, and liberally to endow them;<note place="margin">He Erects Publick Schools, and is present him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self at their Disputations<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
                  </note> because these would be Seminaries for all Orders of Men; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever was eminent or noble in any Commonwealth, issued out from them, as from a Fountain. Hereupon, he drew Learned Men to him by Rewards; yea, himself would be sometimes present at their Disputations, and when he had any Vacation from Civil Affairs, he delighted to hear the Collations of the Learned, thereby endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to eradicate the False Opinion which many Nobles had imbibed, <hi>viz.</hi> That Learning drew Men off from Action to Sloth and Idleness, and did soften Military Spirits, either breaking, or, at least, weaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all their Vigorous Efforts; so that the Study of Letters was only fit for <hi>Monks,</hi> who were shut up, as in a Prison, and good for no other use. But alas, the Monks, as they had degenerated from the Simplicity and Parsimony of their Ancestors, so they had turned themselves wholly from the Culture of their <hi>Minds,</hi> to the Care of their <hi>Bodies</hi>; and Learning was as much neglected by the rest of the Priesthood, also; and especially for this Cause, <hi>That Benefices were bestowed on the most slothful and worst Persons of Noblemens Families,</hi>

Yea, those Parish-Curates, or Priests, as they grew Rich, did scorn to do their own Work themselves, but would hire These Fryars, (for so they called Themselves) for a
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:56771:182"/>
small yearly Stipend, to Preach a Few Sermons, in the year, to the People; In the interim, they withdrew into Cities, and there chaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out their idle Songs, as it were, after a Magical manner, not knowing what they said; and there was none of them, that ever hardly looked towards his own Parish, but when Tithes were to be gathered. Yea, and by degrees, they withdrew themselves from this Office of Singing at certain hours in Cathedrals and Churches, too; which, though it were but a light, was yet a daily, Service; and hired poor Shavelings to supply their Places in Singing and Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sifying; and so by muttering and mumbling out a certain Task and Jargon of <hi>Psalms,</hi> which was appointed every day, they made a collusive kind of a Tragedy, sometimes contending in alternate Verses and Responses; otherwhiles making a <hi>Chorus</hi> between the Acts, which at last closed with the Image, or Representation, of <hi>Christs</hi> Death. And the Friers, their Hirelings, on the one side, did not dare to offend their Masters, on whom their Livelihood depended; neither yet, on the other, could they bear their Insolence, conjoined with so much Avarice; so that they pitched upon a middle way, that they might engage them to make easier Payment of their Pensions; they oftentimes bitterly inveighed against their Lust and Avarice before the People, who gave ear to their Doctrine; and, when they had raved enough in their Sermons to keep them in Fear; and also, to conciliate the minds of the Vulgar, they took up, and consulted for themselves also in time, seeing they were also in Ecclesiastical Orders. They told them, that whatever Disorders were, yet the Order of Priesthood was a <hi>Sacred</hi> thing, and that the Temporal, or Civil, Magistrate, had no Power to punish them; they were only responsible to <hi>God</hi> and to the <hi>Pope,</hi> (who had almost equal Power with God) and because, their Avarice encreasing with their Luxury, they thought they should not squeez Gain enough from the People; therefore these Friers set up a new kind of Tyranny, holding forth, in their Sermons, the Merit of Works. Hence arose <hi>Purgatory,</hi> and the <hi>Lustration</hi> of Souls (which the <hi>Pope</hi> was pleased to detain there) by the <hi>Sacrifices</hi> (forsooth) of the <hi>Mass,</hi> by the sprinkling of <hi>Holy Water,</hi> by <hi>Alms</hi> and <hi>Pensions</hi> given or offered, by <hi>Indulgences, Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimages,</hi> and <hi>Worshipping</hi> of <hi>Reliques</hi>; The Friers being exercised in this kind of Bartering Trade and Chaffer, in a little time, claimed the Power to themselves, both over the <hi>Living</hi> and the <hi>Dead,</hi> too.</p>
               <p>In this ill Condition, <hi>Iames,</hi> the First, found Church-Affairs in <hi>Scotland</hi>; and therefore he thought it the most Compendious Way to restore the Old Discipline,<note place="margin">King <hi>Iames</hi> aims to prefer only Worthy Persons to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices and Church Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments.</note> if Good and Learned Men were admitted to Benefices. And to Increase the Emulations of Young Scholars, he told the Masters and Governors of Universities and Schools, that, because he himself was hindred by the Publick Affairs of State, so that he could not consider every Students particular Merit, they should therefore be very careful to Commend Learned and Virtuous Young Scholars to him, that he might gratifie them with Church-Preferments; who being thus advanced, might not only be Useful to the People by their Doctrine and Example, but also might assist the Meaner and Poorer sort of those that were designed for Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, with their Substance; and so far to Relieve their Tenuity,
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:56771:182"/>
that Good Wits might not be compelled, for Want, to break off their Studies and Course of Learning, and betake themselves to Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical, Sordid, or Mercenary, Trades, and Employments. And to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, that good Men might, with more diligence, apply themselves to Learning, and the Slothful might know, that their only Way to Preferment was by Virtue, he distinguish't Degrees of Studies, that so he might know who were fit for such or such Promotions; Which Course, if succeeding Kings had followed, certainly we had never fallen into these times, wherein the People cannot endure the Vices of the Priests; nor, the Priests, the Remedy of those Vices. Neither was the King ignorant, that the Church was incumber'd with those great mischiefs, under which it then labour'd, by reason of the Immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Opulency thereof, and therefore he did not approve the Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality of Former Kings in exhausting their Treasury to inrich Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries, so that he often said, <hi>That though</hi> David <hi>was otherwise the Best of Kings, yet his profuse Piety, so praised by many, was prejudicial to the Kingdom</hi>; yet notwithstanding, He himself, as if he had been carry'd away by the Rapid Torrent of Evil Custom, could not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold his hand from building a Monastery, for the <hi>Carthusians,</hi> near <hi>Perth,</hi> nor from endowing it with large Revenues. One thing in him was very admirable, that, amidst the greatest Cares for the high Affairs of the Publick, he thought the most inferior and private Matters not unworthy of his Diligence, provided some benefit came to the Publick by them. For whereas <hi>Scotland</hi> had been exercised with continual Wars, after the death of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Third, for almost 150 years, wherein her Cities had been so often spoil'd, and burnt, and her Youth generally made Soldiers, so that other Trades were much neglected, he invited Tradesmen of all sorts to come out of <hi>Flanders,</hi> proposing great Rewards and Immunities to them;<note place="margin">He invites Tradesmen out of <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi>
                  </note> by which means he filled his Cities, (almost empty before, in regard the Nobility did usually keep themselves in the Country) with this sort of Artificers, neither did he only restore the appearance of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Populousness to the Towns hereby; but also ingag'd a great number of Idlers to fall to honest Labour; and hereby it came to pass, that what was with small cost made at home, need not with far greater, be fetch't from abroad.</p>
               <p>Yet, whiles he was thus strengthning all the weak parts of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, by proper Remedies, he ran into the great dislike and offence of his Subjects, especially for Two Reasons. The <hi>one,</hi> seem'd light in appearance, yet 'was That, which is the beginning of almost all Calamity to a People. For when Peace was universally setled; Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Luxury, and Lust, to the destruction, first of ones self, then of others, followed thereupon. Hence arose sumptuous Feastings,<note place="margin">Luxury and Prodigality, the trust of Idleness.</note> Drinking Caresses, by day and night, personated Masks, Delight in strange Apparel, Stateliness of Houses, not for necessary Use, but to please the Eye; A corruption of Manners, falsely called Neatness, and, in all things, a general neglect of the Country Customs; so that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, forsooth, was accounted handsom or comely enough, but that which was New-fangled and Strange. The Commonalty did wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly cast off the fault of these things from themselves, and laid it on the <hi>English</hi> Courtiers, who followed the King, and yet they did
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:56771:183"/>
not inveigh against such wanton and pleasurable Courses, more bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly in their Words, than they studiously practis'd them in their Lives. But the King obviated this Mischief, as much as he could, both by good Laws, and also by his own good Example, for he kept himself in his Apparel and Frugality, within the rate of the Richer sort of private Men, and if he saw any thing of Immoderation in any part of a Man's Life, he shew'd by his Countenance, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by his Words, that 'twas displeasing to him. By this means, the course of increasing Luxury was somewhat restrain'd, rather than the new Intemperance extinguisht, and the old Parsimony reduc'd. His <hi>other</hi> Fault was bruited abroad by his Enemies, and afterwards broke forth into a Publick Mischief. <hi>Robert,</hi> the King's Uncle, and <hi>Murdo</hi> his Cosin-German, who had the Regency of the Kingdom for many Years,<note place="margin">

For they so engaged the Nobles to them, by their Liberality and Munificence, that some injoyed the Lands, belonging to the King, by Connivence. To others they gave them, and, in favour of some particular Men, they Cancell'd Proceedings and Judgments in Law, and restor'd some, who had been banish'd, and, amongst them, one Eminent and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Person, <hi>George Dunbar,</hi> Earl of <hi>Merch</hi>; who, during his Exile, had done much mischief to his Country; and by this means, they hop'd so to ingage the Nobility, that they would never so much as think of calling home the King; and then, if <hi>Iames</hi> Dy'd without Issue, the Kingdom would come to them, without any Competitor; but if he should chance to return from his Banishment, yet their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction would be so powerful, that if the King bore them a Grudge, yet they were able to defend themselves by force against him; but when the King did actually return, the old Favour and Respect born to the Uncle, seem'd to be quite extinguish'd by the new Injury and Flagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiousness of <hi>Murdo,</hi> so that, it plainly appear'd, that <hi>nothing was more popular than Iustice.</hi> And therefore the People were not only consenting, but also contributed their assistance, to the Execution of <hi>Murdo,</hi>

At length, he set upon their numerous Fleet, returning from <hi>Dantzic,</hi> which he took and pillaged, and slew the Mariners, and burnt the Ships, so that he repaid the Enemy for the Loss he receiv'd from them, many times over; yea, he so subdued the Fierceness of their Minds, that they desired a Truce for an Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Years, and obtain'd it; He also caus'd a Breed of brave Mares to be brought from as far as <hi>Hungary,</hi> into <hi>Scotland,</hi> whose Race con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd there for many Years after.</p>

                  </note> That the King had revok'd some Grants made by <hi>Robert</hi> and <hi>Murdo,</hi> the last Regents, as unjust. Amongst those Grants, There were Two noted ones, <hi>George Dunbar,</hi> who was Declared a Publick Enemy, was afterwards recall'd by <hi>Robert,</hi> and part of his Estate restor'd to him. His Son <hi>George</hi> succeeded him therein, to the Joy of many; who were well pleas'd, that so Ancient and Noble a Family, which had so often deserv'd well of their Country, were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor'd to their Ancient Dignity. But the King, who look'd narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (and perhaps, too pryingly) into his Revenue, was of Opinion, that the Power to restore Incapacities, to recal Exiles, and to give back their Goods forfeited for Treason, and so brought into the King's <hi>Exchequer,</hi> was too great for One that was but a Guardian of another Man's Kingdom, and chosen but as a Tutor only, to Claim and Use; especially, since Largesses made in the Minority of Princes, by the Old Laws of <hi>Scotland,</hi> might be recalled; if not confirm'd by their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective Kings, when they came to be of Age.

                  <hi>George</hi> complain'd, that he was wrongfully dispossest of his Ancient Patrimony, for anothers Fault; and such a Fault too, as was forgiven by him, who then had the Supreme Power. The King, to pacifie him, and to proclaim his Clemency amongst the Vulgar, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed <hi>Buchan</hi> upon him. This Fact of the King's was variously spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, as every ones Humour and Disposition led him. And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, there was also another Action, which much hastned his End, the Beginning whereof is to be fetcht a little higher.</p>
               <p>I said before, that King <hi>Robert</hi> the 2d. had Three Sons by his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubine, he had also Two by his Wife <hi>Eufemia, Walter</hi> Earl of <hi>Athole,</hi> and <hi>David</hi> Earl of <hi>Stratherne,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Dispute between <hi>K.

To the 2d. he gave great Wealth, and the Regency also. The 3d. was made Earl of several Counties. In this Matter, tho' his other Wif's Children thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves wrong'd, yet being younger, and not so powerful as they, they smothered their Anger for the present. And besides, their Power was somewhat abated, by the Death of the Earl of <hi>Strathern,</hi> who left but only one Daughter behind him, afterwards Marry'd to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick Graham,</hi> a Noble young Man, and one of a potent Family in that Age, on whom he begat <hi>Meliss Graham</hi>; His Parents liv'd not long after, and the Child, after a few Years, being yet a Stripling, was sent as an Hostage into <hi>England,</hi> till the Money for the King's Ransom was paid.<note place="margin">The Earl of <hi>Athol</hi>'s Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> But the Earl of <hi>Athole,</hi> tho' every way too weak for the adverse Faction, yet never gave over his Project to cut off his Kindred, nor cast away his Hopes to recover the Kingdom; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was inferior in open Force, he craftily fomented their Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions and Discords, and invidiously made use of their Dangers, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote his own Ends, so that by his Advice that large Family was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to a few. For many were of Opinion, that he gave the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel to take off <hi>David,</hi> King <hi>Robert</hi>'s Son; and <hi>Iames</hi> had not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scap'd him neither, unless he had past a good part of his Life in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> far from home; for he gave Advice to the Earl of <hi>Fife,</hi> that seeing his Brother was a Drone, he Himself should seize on the Kingdom. When the King lost all his Children, and was obnoxious to his Brothers Will, and not long after, dyed of Grief himself; There was only the Regent of the Kingdom, with his Children, that hindred his hopes, in regard, he was an active Man, of great Wealth, Power, and Authority, and moreover, very Popular, and full of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. These Considerations did somewhat retard his Counsels, but when <hi>Robert</hi> Dyed of a Natural Death, and his Son <hi>Iohn</hi> was slain in the Battel of <hi>Vernevil,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A Town of <hi>Normandy</hi> in <hi>France.</hi>
                  </note> then he resum'd his former Project with greater earnestness, and bent all his Mind and Endeavour how to free <hi>Iames,</hi> and set him at variance with <hi>Murdo,</hi> and his Children. And seeing they could not, all of them, stand safe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, which soever of them fell, he foresaw, that his Hope would be advanced one step higher, to the Kingdom. And when <hi>Iames</hi> was returned into his Country, he turn'd every Stone to hasten <hi>Murdo</hi>'s Destruction, he suborn'd Men fit for the turn, to forge Crimes
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:56771:184"/>
against him, and he himself sate Judge upon Him and his Sons. And when they were cut off, there was only <hi>Iames</hi> left, and one little Son, a Child, not yet 6 Years old. And if he were slain by the Conspiracy of the Nobles, he did not doubt, but himself, who was then the only remaining Branch of the Royal Stock, should be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd to the Throne. <hi>Athole</hi> was in these Thoughts Night and Day, yet he conceal'd his Secret Purposes, and made a great shew of Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty to the King, in helping to rid his Allies out of the way; for that was his only Contrivance, that, by the Offences of Others, he might increase his own Power, and diminish his Enemies.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, <hi>Meliss Graham</hi> (who, as I said before, was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in Hostage to the <hi>English</hi>) was depriv'd of <hi>Strathern</hi>: because the King making a diligent Enquiry into his Revenue, found, that 'twas given to his Grandfather, by the Mothers-side, upon conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, That if the Male-Line fail'd, it should return to the King, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard 'twas a Male-Feo, as Lawyers now speak. This Young Man's Loss, who was absent, and also an Hostage, did move many to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miserate his Case; but <hi>Robert</hi> his Tutor took it so heinously, that it made him almost Mad. For he,<note place="margin">Plots against <hi>Iames.</hi>
                  </note> taking the Case of his Kinsman more impatiently, than others, did not cease to accuse the King open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Injustice, and being Summon'd to Answer for it in Law, he appear'd not, and thereupon was banish'd the Land. This made his fierce mind more enrag'd for revenge, as being irritated by a new Injury; So that he joyn'd secret Counsels with those, who had also their Estates confiscated; or, who took the punishments of their Friends, tho' justly inflicted, in great disdain; or, who accus'd the King as a Covetous man, because he was so intent upon his gain, that he had not rewarded them, according to their Expectations: And besides, he bewailed, That not only many noble Families were brought to ruin, but that the Wardships of Young Nobles, which were wont to be the Rewards of Valiant Men, were now altogether in the Kings hands, so that all the wealth of the Kingdom was almost in one hand, and others might starve for misery and want, under such an unjust Valuer of their labours.</p>
               <p>Now that which he upbraided him, concerning Wardships, with, is This, 'Tis the Custom in <hi>Scotland, England,</hi> &amp; some Countrys of <hi>France,</hi> that Young Gentlemen or Nobles, when their Parents dye, should remain in the Tutelage of those, whose Feudatarys they are, till they arrive at the age of 21 Years, and all the Profits of their Estates, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the Charges necessary for their Education) and also the Dowry given with their Wives, comes to such their Tutors and Guardians. Now these Tutelages, or, (as they are commonly call'd) <hi>Wardships,</hi> were wont to be Sold to the next of kin, for a great Sum of Money; or sometimes, well deserving men were gratify'd with them;<note place="margin">Upon the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Wardships <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> So that they expected Benefit upon the Sale of such Wardships or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes, for a reward by their keeping of them. But now, they were much vex'd, that the King took them all to himself, neither did they conceal their vexation and displeasure. When the King heard of these Murmurings and Complaints, he excus'd the thing, as done by Necessity, because the publick Revenue had been so lessen'd by former Kings and Governors, that the King could not maintain his
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:56771:185"/>
Family, like himself, nor be decently guarded and attended, nor yet give Magnificent Entertainment to Ambassadors, without them. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, he alleged, that this Parsimony and Care of the King in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding Money in all just and honest Ways, was not unprofitable to the Nobility, themselves; whose greatest damage was, to have the Kings Exchequer low. For then Kings were wont to extort by Force from the Rich, what they could not be without; yea sometimes, they were forced to burden and vex the Commons too, by exacting Taxes and Payments from them, and that, the Parsimony of the King was far less prejudicial to the Publick, by imposing a Mean to immoderate Donations, than his Profuseness was wont to be, for then he was still forc'd to seize on other Mens Estates, when his <hi>Own</hi> was consum'd. This answer satisfy'd all those who were Moderate, but those who were more Violent, and who rather sought after occasions of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, than were willing to hear any just Compurgation of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted Crime, were more vehemently enraged by it.</p>
               <p>This was the State of <hi>Scotland,</hi> when Embassadors arrived out of <hi>France</hi> to fetch <hi>Margarit, Iames</hi> his Daughter, who had before been betrothed to <hi>Lewis,</hi> Son of <hi>Charles</hi> the 7th, home to her Husband; That Embassy brought on another from the <hi>English</hi>;<note place="margin">Embassadors from <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> to <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                  </note> For seeing that the Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> was alienated from their Friendship, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditated a revolt, and that <hi>Paris,</hi> and other transmarine Provinces were up in a Tumult, lest, when all the strength of the Kingdom was drawn out to the <hi>French</hi> War, the <hi>Scots</hi> should invade them, on the other side; The <hi>English</hi> sent Embassadors into <hi>Scotland,</hi> to hinder the Renovation of the League with <hi>France,</hi> and the Consumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Marriage, but rather to persuade a perpetual League with them, who were born in the same Island, and us'd the same Language. And if they would do so, and solemnly Swear, That they would have the same Friends and Enemies with the <hi>English,</hi> then they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd that their King would quit his claim to <hi>Berwick, Roxburgh</hi> and other Places and Countrys, which were, before, in Controversy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Nations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iames</hi> referr'd the Desire of the <hi>English</hi> to the Assembly of the Estates,<note place="margin">The <hi>Scots</hi> joyn with the <hi>French</hi> against <hi>England.</hi>
                  </note> then met at <hi>Perth</hi>; where, after a long debate upon it, the Ecclesiasticks were divided into two Factions; but the Nobility cry'd out, That they knew well enough the Fraud of the <hi>English</hi>; who, by this new League, sought to break their old Band of Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the <hi>French,</hi> that so when the <hi>Scots</hi> had lost their Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Friend, they might be more obnoxious to them, if, at any time, they were freed from other Cares, and could wholly intend a War with <hi>Scotland</hi>; and that the liberal Promises of the <hi>English</hi> were for no other End; but as for themselves, they would stand to their old League, and not violate their Faith, once given. The <hi>English,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus repuls'd, turn from Petitions to Threats, and seeing they refus'd to embrace their Friendships, they denounc'd War; telling the <hi>Scots,</hi> that if their King sent over his betroth'd Daughter into <hi>France,</hi> one that was an Enemy to the <hi>English</hi>; The <hi>English</hi> would hinder their Passage, if they could; yea, and take them Prisoners, and their Retinue too, having a Fleet ready fitted for that purpose.

For, First, their Detaining of him, when he landed on their Coast, being against their League, and also the Law of Nations, 'twas a Wrong, not a Courtesy; Next, as to their not killing him, but putting him to a ransom for Money, rather than imbrue their hands in the Blood, not of an Enemy, but of a Guest, That was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributable not so much to their Love or Mercy toward Him, as to their Covetous and avaritious Minds; and grant, there were any Courtesy in it, yet what was it other, but like that of Thieves, who would seem to give the Life, which they took not away? and, if he were ingag'd to the <hi>English</hi> on that account, 'twas a private, not publick, debt. As for their bestowing Education upon him, who was Innocent, by reason of his Age, a Suppliant by his Fortune, and a King by Descent, tho' most unrighteously detain'd, it bears, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, some shew of Humanity, which, if they had neglected, they might have been justly blamed; and indeed it had been a commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable piece of Kindness, if the Injury going before, and the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness following after, had not marr'd it; unless you will say, that if you purposely wound a Man, you may require him to give you thanks for his Cure, and so you imagin a light Compensation for a great Loss, is to be esteem'd as a Courtesy; or, because you have done some Part of your duty, that, therefore you should expect the Reward, in full, of a benefit, bestowed on another. For, he that takes Care that his Captive should be Educated in Learning, either for his

But, <hi>he gave a very large Dowry with her</hi>; To whom, I pray, was it given, but to the <hi>English</hi> themselves, who took it away, before it was paid, and made a shew of it in Words to the Husband, but, indeed, kept it for their own use? so that the Dowry was only spoken of, not given; and so spoken of, That they would have the Young Man, whom they also had otherwise grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vously wrong'd, much indebted to them, that he carried his Wife away with him, without a Dowry. But, <hi>they sent him home a Freeman,</hi> say they; Yes, as a Pyrate doth Discharge his Captive, when his Ransom is paid: But how free, I pray? Even if we may believe the <hi>English</hi> Writers themselves, under the inforc'd Obligation of an Oath, always to obey the <hi>English</hi> King, as his Lord, and so to bring a Kingdom, which he did yet injoy, into a perpetual Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude, which if he had actually injoyed he could not alienate; and yet he must mancipate it, forsooth, before he received it. This is not to set one free, but to turn him loose with a longer Chain, and that, not as a <hi>King,</hi> but as a <hi>Steward</hi> only, or <hi>Vicegerent</hi> of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother man's Kingdom.

The King, being dismay'd at this sudden news, Disbanded his Army, and return'd home, but was very ill spoken of amongst the Vulgar, because, just upon the point of Surrender, at the beck of a Woman, he retir'd after the Kingdom had been at so much charge and trouble; so that, he seem'd to have sought for nothing by his Arms, but Disgrace. After he return'd, he went to the Monast'ry of the <hi>Dominicans,</hi> near the Walls of <hi>Perth,</hi> to make a private enquiry into the Conspiracy, as well as he was able; but his design was smelt out, by Men, that Watcht all opportunities to do mischief; for one of the Kings Domesticks, who was in the Plot, (Historians call him <hi>Iohn,</hi> but his Sirname is not mentioned) dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to his Complices, what was doing at Court, so that, they hastned the matter, lest their secret Caballs should be discovered, and Remedies apply'd against them. <hi>Walter,</hi> Earl of <hi>Athole,</hi> the Kings Uncle, tho' he were the Ring-leader of the Conspiracy, yet did what he could to avert all Suspicion from himself; He sent for his Kinsman, <hi>Robert Graham,</hi> (of whom I have spoken before) as fit for Execution, but rash in Counsel, and who bore an old grudge to the King, because of his former Imprisonment and Banishment, and also upon the account of his Brothers Son, (to whom he was Guardian, in his hope) who had <hi>Strathern</hi> taken from him; he joyns with him <hi>Robert</hi> his Nephew by his Son, an active Young Man, he informs them, what he would have them to do, and that when the Deed was done, he should be in high Authority, and then he would provide for their Safety well enough; they freely promise to do their Endeavour, and accordingly hasten to perpetrate the Fact, before the whole Series of the Plot was made known to the King.
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:56771:187"/>
Hereupon they privately gathered their Company together, that so, knowing the King had but a few about him in the Monast'ry of the <hi>Dominicans,</hi> he might with as little noise as might be cut him off; and that they might surprize him unawares, they advise <hi>Iohn</hi> his Servant, above-mentioned, whom they had drawn to their Party, to be assistant to them; according to his promise, he brings the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirators in the midst of the Night into the Court, and placed them pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately near the Kings Bed-Chamber, and shews them the Door, which they might easily break, in regard he had taken away the Bar there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; Some think, that they were received into the Palace by <hi>Robert,</hi> Nephew of the Earl of <hi>Athole.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean time, whilst they waited there, being solicitous how to break the Door, which they thought would be their greatest Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacle, Fortune did the Work without their Helps, for <hi>Walter Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> who, a little before, had carried in Wine, coming forth, and perceiving Men in Arms, endeavour'd to get in again, and cry'd out with as loud a Voice as he could, <hi>Traitors, Traitors.</hi> Whilst the Conspirators were dispatching him, a noble young Damsel, of the Family of the <hi>Douglas</hi>'s, as most say, tho' some write She was a <hi>Lovel,</hi> shut the Door, and not finding the Bar, which was fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently laid aside by the Servant, She thrust her Arm into the Hole or Staple, instead of a Bolt, but they quickly brake that, and so rusht in upon the King.

And then, when he was left of all, they gave him 28 Wounds, and some of them just in his Heart, and so kill'd him. Thus this Good King came to his End, (and that a most Cruel one too, and much lamented by all Good Men) by the Conspiracy of most wicked Assassins and Robbers; when his Death was divulg'd by the Noise and Lamentation which was made, a great Concourse of People came presently into the Court, and there spent the rest of the Night (for the Paricides had made their Escape in the dark) in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailings and Complaints. There, every one spake variously accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their several Dispositions, either bitterly, to raise a greater Odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um against the Parricides; or, lamentably, to increase the Grief of their Friends; each Man reckon'd up what Prosperities, or Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities, he had undergone.

Then Fortune chang'd, and he had an unlook'd for Restoration; and after his Return, in a few Years, he Govern'd so, that the tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent State of the Kingdom was chang'd in a Calm and Serene One.

But, perhaps, some will say, These are but the Flowers of his Studies, where is the Fruit? These are more for Ornament, than Instruction or Use, to strengthen a Man for doing of Business: Know then, that, after he had Learn'd other Parts of Philosophy, he was also skill'd in <hi>Politicks,</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Regulation of Kingdoms, and of Mens Manners. How Great, and how Ripe, Civil Abilities were in him, doth sufficiently appear, by the order of the Matters perform'd by him, and by the Laws which he made; whereby he exceedingly benefited, not only his own Age, but even Posterity also. And his Death declar'd, that there is nothing more Popular than Justice; for they who were wont to detract from him, whilst he was alive; now he was dead, had most flagrant Desires after him. Insomuch, that the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, as soon as they heard he was Murder'd, came in of their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, from their respective Countries, and, before a Tryal was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, they voluntarily sent out into all Parts, to apprehend the Murderers, and bring them to Justice; very many of them were taken. The Principal of them were put to new and exquisite kinds of Death. The rest were hang'd.

In the 1st, he was put on a Cart, wherein a Stork-like Swipe or Engine was erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and by Ropes, let through Pullies, was hoisted up on high, and then the Ropes being suddainly loos'd, he was let down again, almost to the Ground, with grievous pains, by reason of the Luxation of the Joints of his Body. Then he was set on a Pillory that all might see him, and a Red-hot-Iron-Crown set on his Head, with this Inscription, that he should be called <hi>King of all Traitors.</hi> They say, the cause of this punishment, was, that <hi>Walter</hi> had been sometimes told, by some Female Witches, (as <hi>Athole</hi> was always noted to have such) That he should be Crown'd King in a mighty Concourse of People; for, by this means that Prophecy was either fulfill'd or eluded, as indeed, such kind of Predictions do commonly meet with no other Events. The Day after, he was bound upon a Hurdle, and drawn at an Horse-Tail thro' the greatest Street in <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> The 3d Day, he was laid along upon a Plank in a conspicuous Place, and his Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els were cut out, whilst he was alive, cast into the Fire, and burnt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

His Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was divided into Four Quarters, and sent to be hang'd up in the most noted Places of the best Cities of the Kingdom. After him, his Nephew was brought forth to suffer, but, because of his Age, they would not put him to so much pain; and besides, he was not the Author, but only an Accomplice in another Man's wicked Design, as having Obey'd his Grandfather therein; so that, he was only Hang'd, and Quarter'd. But <hi>Robert Graham,</hi> who did the Deed with his own Hand, was carried in a Cart thro' the City, and his Right Hand was nail'd to a Gallows, which was set up in the Cart, and then came Executioners, which did continually run Red-hot-Iron Spikes into his Thighs, Shoulders, and those Parts of his Body, which were most remote from the Vitals; and then he was Quarter'd, as the former. After this manner was the Death of <hi>Iames</hi> vindicated, 'tis true, 'twas a cruel one, but 'twas reveng'd by Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments so Cruel, that they seem'd to exceed the very bounds of Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;<note place="margin">Descants upon such severe Executions.</note> for such extreme kinds of Punishment do not so much restrain the Minds of the Vulgar, by the fear of Severity, as they do make them wild to do, or suffer, any thing; neither do they so much deter wicked Men from committing Offences by their Acerbity, as they lessen their Terror, by often beholding them; especially, if the Spirits of the Criminals be so hardened, that they flinch not at their Punishment. For among the unskilful Vulgar, <hi>a stubborn Confidence is sometimes prais'd for a firm and stable Constancy.

The Craft of the Queen was commended by all, and the old Opinion of Wisdom which the Chancellor had obtained, became now to be a Ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule, even to the Vulgar. This Jovialty and immoderate Joy of the Commons lasted (as is usual) Two days, and was celebrated by them all.</p>
               <p>The Third day, those of <hi>Alexanders</hi> Faction came in, some out of new Hopes; others, invited by the Authority of the Kings Name, to whom, when the Series of the Project was declared in order; the Courage of the Queen in undertaking the Matter; her Wisdom in carrying it on; and her Happiness in effecting it, were extolled to the Skies. The Avarice, and Universal Cruelty, of the Chancellor, and especially, his Ingratitude to the <hi>Queen,</hi> and the <hi>Regent,</hi> were highly inveighed against. He was accused, as the only Author of all the Disorders, and consequently of all the Mischiefs arising therefrom; Moreover, That he had diverted the Publick Revenue to his own use; That he had violently seized on the Estates of Private Persons, and what he could not carry away, he spoil'd;<note place="margin">The Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor highly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused,</note> That he alone had all the Wealth, Honour, and Riches, when others were pining in Ignominy, Solitude, and Want; Those Grievances, though great, yet were like to be seconded with more oppressive Ones, unless, by Gods Aid and Counsel, the Queen had, no less valiantly, than happily, freed the King out of Prison, and so deliver'd others from the <hi>Chancellor</hi>'s Tyranny<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> for, if he kept his own King in Prison, it was evident, what private Men might fear and expect from him? What hope could there ever be, that he would be reconciled to his Adversaries, who had so perfidiously circumvented his Friends? And how could the inferior sort expect
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:56771:190"/>
Relief from him, whose unsatiable Avarice all their Estates were not able to satisfie and fill up? And therefore, seeing, by Gods help in the first place, and then by the Queens Sagacity, they were freed from his Tyranny, all Courses were to be taken, that this Joy might be perpetual: And to make it so, there was but One way, which was to pull the Man, as it were, by the Ears, out of his Castle, that Nest of Tyranny; and either to kill him, or so to disarm him, that for the future, he might do them no more Mischief; though (said they) his disarming was not very safe, in regard such a Beast as he, who had been accustomed to Blood and Rapin, would never be at quiet, so long as the Breath was in his Body.</p>
               <p>This was <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Discourse in Council, to whom all did assent, so that an Order was made, that every one should go home, and levy what Force they could to besiege the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">And besieged in <hi>Edinburgh</hi> Castle.</note> from which they were not to depart, till they had taken it. And that this might be done with greater Facility, the Queen promised to send thither a great Quantity of Provision, which she had in her Store-houses in <hi>Fife</hi>; but Haste was to be used, whiles their Counsels were yet private, and the Enemy had no Warning to provide things, fit and necessary for a Siege: And in the interim, they need not fear <hi>Douglas,</hi> who, they knew, was a mortal Enemy to the <hi>Chancellor,</hi> so that now, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they had all the Power, Treasure enough, and withal the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Kings Name, That being now taken from Him, he could have no Hope, but to fly to their Mercy.</p>
               <p>Thus, the Assembly being Dissolved, all things were speedily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for the Expedition, and a close Siege laid to the Castle. The <hi>Chancellor</hi> was acquainted well enough with their Designs, but he placed the greatest Hope of his Safety, and of maintaining his Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,<note place="margin">The <hi>Chancellor</hi> craves Aid of <hi>Douglas,</hi>

<q>That he would always be at his Devotion, if he would aid him in his present Extremity; urging, that he was deceiv'd, if he thought, that their Cruelty would rest in the Destruction of himself alone; but that they would make his Overthrow as a step to destroy <hi>Douglas,</hi> too. <hi>Douglas</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd his Message, with more Freedom, than Advantage; <hi>viz.</hi> That both <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>William</hi> were equally guilty of Perfidious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Avarice, and that their falling out was not for any point of Virtue, or for the good of the Publick, but for their own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Advantages,<note place="margin">But receives an affronting Answer from him.</note> Animosities, and Feuds; and that it was no great matter, which of them had the better in the Dispute; yea, if they fell Both in the Contest, the Publick would be a great Gainer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by; and that no good Man would desire to see an happier sight, than two such Fencers to hack and hew one another. This Answer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing noised abroad in Both Armies, (for the Castle was already be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged) was the Occasion, That a Peace was sooner clapt up, than any one thought it would.</q>
There was a Truce made for Two days, wherein <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>William</hi> had a Meeting, where they discours'd one with another, how dangerous it would be, both for the Publick and their private Estates, too, if they should persist in their Hatred, even to a Battel;<note place="margin">Whereupon he agrees with the <hi>Regent,</hi>

The King supped that night in the Castle, thus surrendred to him, and the next day, the Government of the Castle was bestowed on <hi>William,</hi> and the Regen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy on <hi>Alexander.</hi> Thus, after a deadly hatred between them, it was hoped, that for ever after, the Foresight of their mutual Advantage, and the Fear of their Common Enemy, had tied a firm and indissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Knot of Friendship betwixt them.</p>

               <p>When this matter was noised abroad, it rais'd up Envy on the Regent, because of his Power, and procur'd favour to the Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, because of his Retirement; neither did <hi>William</hi> neglect his op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity amongst their Feuds; for, he resolved, by some bold At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, to curb the Insolence of his Adversary, and to remove the Undervalue, he had set upon him And therefore, having under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, by his Spys, that the King went every day a hunting, and was but Slightly guarded, watching the Season when <hi>Alexander</hi> was absent, and having made sufficient Enquiry into the Conveniency of the Country, the Fitness of the Time, and the due Number of the Undertakers, he chose out a Place not far from <hi>Sterlin,</hi> where the Faithfullest of his Friends, with what Force they could make, should meet and wait for his Coming.

The King seem'd by his Countenance to approve of what he had said, either that he really thought so; or else, that he dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled his Fear. Whereupon, the Chancellor took his Horses Bridle in's hand, and led him to his own Men; They which were with him, being few, and unarm'd, not able to Encounter so many Men, return'd back, in great sadness. Thus the King came to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> guarded with 4000 Horse, well accoutred, where he was received, by the Commonalty, with great demonstrations of Joy.</p>

At length, he took a little heart, and began to think with himself, what Remedy to apply to his present Malady; He knew, that his own Strength was not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient against the Chancellor, a Man politick in Counsel and strong in Force; and besides, he had the Favour of the People, and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Kings Name, as Buttresses to support him; as for the Queen, he had so offended her by her close Imprisonment, that she was hardly ever like to be reconciled to him; and if she were, He had no great confidence in her Assistance.<note place="margin">And Meditates a Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with him.</note> And for <hi>Douglas,</hi> 'tis true, he had Strength enough, but no Prudence; his Age was tender; his Mind infirm; he was corrupted by Flatteries, and carried about by the Persuasions of others; and (as in such Circumstances it usually falls out) the worst of Men could do most with him, and therefore he thought it below his Dignity to have any thing to do with such a Raskality of men; But the Chancellor, tho' he were of a Contrary Faction to him, yet was a Wise man, and his Age and Disposition might more safely be trusted; neither was the Cause of Offence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, so great, but that it was superable by their ancient offices of Respect one to another; but the greatest likelihood of their Reconciliation was grounded upon the Similitude of their Danger, and their joynt Consent to maintain the Safety of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. And besides, the Enmity of the Chancellor was most of all to be fear'd by him, for if he joyn'd himself to other Factions, he had Power in his hands either to reduce, or banish, him. Having pondered upon these things, for some days, in his Mind, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated them to some of his most familiar Friends, Good men and Lovers of their Country, by their Advice, he took a smal ordinary Train of Attendants, and went to <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> It happen'd, that the Bishops of <hi>Aberdene</hi> and <hi>Murray</hi> were then there; Men, according to the rate of those times, of Learning and Virtue. By their Means and Intercession, the Regent and Chancellor had a Meeting in St. <hi>Giles</hi>'s Church, with some few of their Friends on each Side. The Regent First began to speak;

to the Kingdom, or privately Injurious to our Selves. The Eyes of all men are upon us Two: Wicked Persons propose to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves a Licentiousness to do any thing, when we are destroy'd; and Ambitious ones think then, also, to obtain an Opportunity to get Wealth and Power; and besides, we have a great many Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligners and Envyers, <hi>as usually Men, raised up from a low Estate to the highest Dignity, are wont to have.</hi> All These, as they grieve at our Successes, and calumniate our Prosperity; so they willingly receive the News of our Adversity, as thereby hoping, and wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for our Ruin, and therefore it will be worth Both our labours, to consult our Own Safety, which is conjoyn'd and twisted with That of the Publick, and so to revenge our selves on our Enemies and Detractors, to our great Glory and Praise. And the only Way to accomplish those Ends, is This, That we forget our private In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, and contribute all our Thoughts and Counsels for the Good of the Publick; let us remember, that the Kings safety is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to our Cares, and so is also the Safety of the Kingdom; yet so, that we are Both lyable to an Account. And therefore, as, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, we have been to blame in contending, which of us should be the greater in Honour and Authority; so, for the Future, let our contest be, which shall exceed other in Moderation and Justice: And, by this means, we shall bring it to pass, that the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty, who now hate us, and impute all their Calamities to us, will be reconciled to, and revere, us, again. And the Nobility, who, upon our disunion, have broke forth into unbridled Licentiousness, may be reduc'd to Moderation; and the Great Men, who slight us, as weakned by Division, may fear us, when united and reconciled, and so carry themselves with greater Sobriety toward us, than ever. As for me, I willingly give up the tender Age of the King to be modell'd and govern'd by you, as his Father, in his Life time, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed; for, as often as I seriously think of that Function and Service, I judge my self rather to be eas'd of a Burden, than des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poil'd of an Honour, thereby; If I have received any private In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury from you, I freely forgive it for the sake of the Publick; and if I have done you any Wrong, let honest Arbitrators adjust the damage, and I will make you Satisfaction to the full; and hereafter, I will so carry it, that neither my Losses, nor my Advantages, shall be the least stop to the Publick Prosperity. And if you also be of the same Mind, we may Both of us rest Secure for the present, and also leave our Memorys more grateful to Posterity; but if you think o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, I call all men to Witness, both present and to come, that 'tis not my Fault, that the Evils, under which we now labour, are not, either fully cur'd, or, at least, in some sort reliev'd and mitigated.</q>

For, I see as well as you, by this our Discord, That Good Men are expos'd to the Injuries of the Bad; The minds

And whilst we thus betray the Safety of the Publick, our private Affairs are in no better a Posture. In the mean time, Men, who are given to Sedition, make advantage of our Discords; and our Enemies behold them, as a pleasant Sight, (for they hate us Both alike) and if the loss fall on either of us, yet they count themselves to gain, what either of us doth lose: And therefore I shall not repeat the Causes of our Feuds; lest I make old sores to bleed afresh, but, in short, I declare, that I forgive all my private Wrongs and Injuries upon the Score of my Country, for there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was, nor shall be, any thing more preferrable with me before the Safety of the People, and the Good of the Common-wealth.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Those, who were present, did highly commend both their Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;<note place="margin">A New Knot of Amity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, and the Chancellor.</note> and so, by joynt Consent, Arbiters were chosen, to compose Differences; and, to the great joy of all, old Discords were pluckt up by the roots, and new Foundations of Amity laid; and thus they, by joynt Counsel, again undertake the Management of the Kingdom. After this Concord, an Assembly of the Estates was held at <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> Thither came not a Few Persons, as is usual, but even whole Clans and Tenantrys, (as if they had remov'd their Habitations) to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of the Wrongs they had sustain'd; and indeed, the Sight of such a miserable Company could not be entertain'd without deep Affliction of Spirit, every one making his woful moan, according to his Circumstance; that Robbers had despoiled Fathers of their Children;<note place="margin">The Miseries of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</note> Children of their Fathers; Widows of their Husbands, and all in general of their Estates; Whereupon, after Commisera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sufferers; The Envy (as is usual) and Reflection was carry'd to, and fix'd upon, the Captains of those Thieves; whose Offences were so impudent, that they could, in no wise, be suffer'd; and their Faction was so far diffus'd, that no man was able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend his Life or Fortune, unless he were of their Party; yea, their Power was so great, that the Authority of the Magistrate could afford little help to the poorer and weaker Sort against their Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and Force: Whereupon the Wiser sort of Counsellors were of Opinion, That, seeing their Power was insuperable by plain Force, 'twas best to undermine it by degrees; They all knew well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, that the Earl of <hi>Douglas</hi> was the Fountain of all those Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,<note place="margin">Occasioned Principally by the Earl of <hi>Douglas.</hi>
                  </note> yet no Man durst name him publickly; whereupon the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, dissembling his Anger for the present, persuaded the whole Assembly, That it was more adviseable for them to cajole <hi>Douglas</hi> by Flatteries, than to irritate him by Suspicions; for he was of so great Power, that he alone, if he remain'd refractary, was able to hinder the Execution of the Decrees of All the Estates; but if he joyn'd himself with the Assembly, then he might easily heal the present Mischiefs.</p>
               <p>Semblable to this Advice, a Decree was made, that Letters of Complement, in the Name of the Estates, should be sent to him, to put him in Mind of the Place which he held; and of the great and Illustrious Merits of his Ancestors, for the Advantage of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:56771:193"/>
and withal to desire him to come to the Publick Assembly of the Estates, which could not be well Celebrated, without the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of him and his Friends. If he had any Complaint to make in the Assembly, they would give him all the Satisfaction they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to do; and if he or his Friends had done any thing prejudicial to the Publick; in respect to his Noble Family, which had so often well deserv'd of their Country, they were ready to remit many things upon the account of his Age; of the Time; of himself, and the great Hopes conceiv'd of him. And therefore they desired, he would come and undertake what part of the Publick Government, he pleas'd; for, seeing <hi>Scotland</hi> had often been deliver'd from great Dangers by the Arms of the <hi>Douglas</hi>'s, they hop'd, that, by his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, he would now strengthen and relieve his Country which la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour'd under Intestine Evils.</p>
               <p>The Young Man, who, by his Age and Disposition, was desirous of Glory, was taken with the Bait; and his Friends also persuaded him, for they were all blinded by their particular Hopes; so that their Minds were turn'd, from all Apprehension of Danger, to the sole Consideration of their particular Advantages. When the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor heard, that he was on his Journey, he went out several Miles to meet him, and gave him a Friendly Invitation to his Castle, which was near the Road, (it was called <hi>Creighton</hi>) where he was Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently entertain'd, for the space of Two Days, in which time, the <hi>Chancellor</hi> shew'd him all imaginable Respect, that he might the more easily intrap the unwary Young Man: For, to shew that his Mind was no way alienated from him, he began, in a familiar manner, to persuade him to be mindful of the Kings Dignity, and of his own Duty; that he should own him for his Leidge Lord, whom his Birth, the Laws of the Country, and the Decree of the Estates had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd to be King; that he should transmit the great Estate, which his Ancestors had got by their Blood and Valour, to his Posterity, in like manner as he had receiv'd it; that so the Name of the <hi>Dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glasses,</hi> which was Illustrious for their Loyalty and Atchievements, might be freed from the foul Blot of Treason; yea, and from all Sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion of the same; that he and his Tenants should forbear oppressing the poor Commons; that he should put all Robbers out of his Train; and for the future, he should so addict himself to the maintenance of Justice, that if he had offended heretofore, it might be thought attributable to the ill Counsel of Bad Men, and not to the Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nese of his own Nature; for, in that tender and infirm Age, his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance would pass for Innocence. By these and the like Speeches, he persuaded the young Man, that he was his entire Friend, and so drew him on to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> with <hi>David</hi> his Brother, who was privy to all his Projects and Designs. But his Followers smelt out some suspicion of Deceit, by reason of the frequent Messages that past be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Alexander</hi> and the Regent; for almost every Moment, Posts ran betwixt them; and besides, the Chancellors Speech seem'd to some more glozing and kind, than was usual for one of his Place and Dignity. His Train did secretly mutter this, and some freely told him
<q>That if he were resolv'd to go on, yet he should send back <hi>David</hi> his Brother, and (according to his Fathers advice to him, on
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:56771:194"/>
his Death Bed,) not give up his whole Family to one stroke of Fortune.</q>
But the improvident Youth was Angry with his Friends, that had thus advis'd him; and caus'd a Word to be given forth to all his Followers; to surcease all such private Whisperings: And to his Friends he made Answer,
<q>That he knew well enough, that 'twas the common Plague of great Families, to be troubled with Men, who loved not to be quiet, and who made a gain of the Dangers and Miseries of their Patrons: And that such Men, because in time of Peace, they were bound up by Laws, were the Authors and Advisers to Sedition, that so they might Fish the better in troubled Waters; but for his part, he had rather cast himself on the known Prudence of the Regent and Chancellor, than give Ear to the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merity and Madness of Seditious Persons.</q>
Having spoken these Words, to cut off any occasion of further advice in the Case, he set Spurs to his Horse, and with his Brother, and a few more of his Confidents, hastned to the Castle, with more speed than at the rate of an ordinary March; and so, Fate drawing him on, he precipitated himself into the Snares of his Enemies.</p>
               <p>In that very Moment of time, the Regent came in too, for so it was agreed, that the whole weight of so great Envy might not lye on one Mans Shoulders only.<note place="margin">Where he and his Brother <hi>David</hi> were slain.</note> 
                  <hi>Douglas</hi> was kindly received, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Kings Table; but in the midst of the Feast, some Armed Men beset him, being Weaponless, and put a Bulls Head upon him, which, in those Times, was a Messenger and Sign of Death. When the young Man saw that, he was troubled and sought to arise, but the Armed Men laid hold on, and carry'd him to a Court near the Castle; where, by the loss of his Head, he paid for the Intemperance of his Youth. <hi>David</hi> his Brother, and <hi>Malcolm Fleming,</hi> whom, next to his Brother, he trusted most of all, were also put to Death with him. 'Tis said, that the King, who was now fully entring on his being of Age, wept for his Death; and that the Chancellor did greatly Rebuke him for his unseasonable Tears, at the Destruction of an Enemy; whereas the Publick Peace was never like to be settled, as long as he was alive. <hi>William</hi> dying thus without Children, <hi>Iames</hi> (Sirnamed <hi>Crassus,</hi> or the <hi>Gross,</hi> from his Disposition,) succeeded him in the Earldom, (for 'twas a <hi>Male-Feo,</hi> as Lawyers speak) the rest of his Patrimony, which was very great, fell to his only Sister <hi>Beatrix,</hi> a very beautiful Person in her Days. This <hi>Iames,</hi> the <hi>Gross,</hi> though he were no bad Man, yet was no less sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected by the King, and hated by the Commons, than the former Earl; because, though he did not maintain Robbers, as the former Earl had done; yet he was not very Zealous in subduing them; but he was substracted from this Envy, by his Death, which happen'd Two Years after.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>William,</hi> the Eldest of his Seven Sons, Succeeded him, he being Emulous of the ancient Power of the Family, that he might restore it unto its Pristine Splendor, resolv'd to Marry his Uncles Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who was the Heiress of many Countries: Many of his Kindred did not approve of the Match,<note place="margin">

<pb n="371" facs="tcp:56771:194"/>
also formidable to the King. For a Rumor was spread abroad, and that not without ground, that the King himself would do his utmost, to hinder the Match. This made <hi>William</hi> to hasten the Consumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Marriage, even in the time when Marriages were forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, that he might prevent the Kings endeavours, to the contrary.

Amongst them there was one <hi>George Gorm,</hi> of <hi>Athole,</hi> who pillag'd all the Country about him, and set upon <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Ruthven,</hi> Sheriff of <hi>Perth,</hi> because he was leading a Thief of <hi>Athole</hi> to the Gallows, and fought with him, as it were, in a set Battel. At last <hi>Gorm</hi> the Captain, and 30 of his Followers, were slain, and the rest sled to the Mountains. This Bustling Fight was in the year of <hi>Christ</hi> 1443.</p>
               <p>A few days after, the Castle of <hi>Dunbarton,</hi> impregnable by Force, was twice taken in a little time: <hi>Robert Semple</hi> was Commander of the Lower Castle; and <hi>Patrick Galbreth</hi> of the Higher, and their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was so divided, that each had a peculiar entrance into his own Part. These Two were not free from Factions, amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. For <hi>Patrick</hi> was thought secretly to favour the <hi>Douglasses</hi>; whereupon <hi>Semple,</hi>

                     <hi>Dunbarton</hi> Castle twice surprized.</note> perceiving that his Part was but negligently guarded, seiz'd upon him, and commanded him to remove his Goods. The day after, <hi>Patrick</hi> entred with four Companions attending him, without Arms, to fetch out his Goods; where, first, he light upon the Porter alone, and then, catching up Arms, drave him and the rest out of the Upper Castle, and thus, sending for Aid out of the Neighbouring Town, he beat them out of the Lower Castle also, and so reduc'd the whole Fort into his own hands.</p>
               <p>About that time, there were very many Murders committed upon the inferior Sort, which were partly perpetrated by the <hi>Douglassians,</hi> and partly charg'd upon them, by their Enemies. The King was now of Age, and manag'd the Government himself, so that <hi>Douglas,</hi> being unable to stand against the Envy of the Nobles,<note place="margin">King <hi>Iames,</hi> being of Age<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> enters on the Government.</note> and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of the Commons, too, resolves to become a New Man, to satisfie the People, and, by all means possible, to atone the Heart of the King, which was alienated from him; and, in order thereunto, he came with a great Train to <hi>Sterlin.</hi> And when he had Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence by some Courtiers, whom he had greas'd in the Fist, and made his Own, that the Kings Anger was appeas'd towards him, then, and not before, he came into his Presence, and threw down his Life<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and Fortune, and all his Concerns, at his Feet, and to his Dispose; he partly excused the Crimes of his former Life, and pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

The Chief of them were <hi>Iames Kennedy</hi> Archbishop of <hi>St. Andrews, George</hi> Earl of <hi>Angus, Iohn</hi> Earl of <hi>Morton,</hi> Both the later of <hi>Douglas</hi>'s his own Family; but One Born of the King's Aunt, the Mother of <hi>Iames Kennedy</hi>; the Other had Marry'd the King's Sister. These Persons did always prefer the Publick Safety, and their Duty for the Conservation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, before the private Respect to their own Family: But <hi>Kennedy</hi> exceeded the rest, in Age, Counsel, and consequently in Authority; and therefore his Wrath was, principally, incensed against him: Whereupon, the Earl of <hi>Craford,</hi> and <hi>Alexander Ogilby</hi> gather'd a reasonable Army together, and spoil'd his Lands in <hi>Fife</hi>; and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Prey, rather than the Cause, they plunder'd the Neighbor Farms also, with a great devastation; and then, without any Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, return'd into <hi>Angus,</hi> laden with Spoil.

For, the same Year, wherein these things were acted, the Colledge of the <hi>Benedictins</hi> at <hi>Aberbrothock,</hi> (in regard, Monks might not intermeddle to judge in Civil Causes) had made <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Lindsy,</hi> Eldest Son of the Earl of <hi>Craford,</hi> their Chief Judge in Civils, or, as they call him, <hi>Sheriff,</hi> or <hi>Bayliff.</hi> He, with his huge Train of Followers, became burdensome to the Monast'ry; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, he carried himself as their <hi>Master,</hi> rather than their <hi>Servant,</hi> so that they dispossest him of his Offices, and put <hi>Alexander Ogilby,</hi> in his Place; <hi>Lindsy</hi> lookt upon This as a Wrong to him, in his Opinion, so that each of them gather'd together what Force they could, as if a War had been denounc'd between them; when Both Armies stood in a readiness to Fight, the Earl of <hi>Craford</hi> having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it, made all the haste he could, and rode in betwixt Them Both, thinking, that the sole Authority of his Name had been Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of proof to him; and whilst he was hindring his Son from ingaging, and calling out <hi>Ogilby</hi> to a Conference,<note place="margin">The <hi>Clans</hi> of the <hi>Lindsys</hi> and <hi>Ogilbys</hi> Fight.</note> a Soldier darted a Spear into his Mouth; it was not known, Who he was, nor What he aim'd at, and struck him down dead from his Horse; His Death

was as an Alarm to Both Armies, and after a sharp Conflict, many being wounded on Both sides, the Victory fell to the <hi>Lindsys</hi>: They say, the Cause thereof was, that, whilst Both Armies stood with their Spears upright, representing the fashion of a Wood, a certain Man cry'd out, Why do you bring those Goads with you, as if you had to do with Oxen? Pray, cast them away, and let us fight it out with our Swords, hand to hand, by true Valour, as becomes Men? Upon which Words, they all cast away their Pikes, on both sides, except 100 <hi>Clydesdale</hi> Men, whom <hi>Douglas</hi> had sent in to Aid the <hi>Lindsyst</hi> These held the Tops, or Points, of their Pikes in their Hands; and drew the rest of them behind their Backs; but when they came to Handy-blows, then they held them out as a thick Fence, before them, and their Enemies, being terrified with the sudden Spectacle, had their Ranks broken thereby. The Conquering side lost 100; the Conquer'd 500, and amongst them, some Men of Note; <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander Ogilby</hi> was taken prisoner, and Dyed a few Days after, either of his Wounds, or for Grief; <hi>Gordon,</hi> Earl of <hi>Huntly,</hi> was put upon a Horse by a Friend of his own, and so escap'd.

               <p>About the same time, <hi>Patrick Hepburn,</hi> Earl of <hi>Hales,</hi>

               <p>Amidst these Discords, the Men of <hi>Annandale</hi> did vex the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning Countries with all sorts of Calamities. The Cause of all these Mischiefs was cast upon the Earl of <hi>Douglas,</hi> who yet did all he could to conceal these Facts of his <hi>Clans,</hi> for he openly Studied no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than to afflict the Men of different Parties, in regard, he was grown to that height of Power, that 'twas a Capital Offence to question any of his Doings.

his Pardon; and since that time, he had liv'd remote, and free from all suspicion of any Crime, of which, this was an evident Token, That the Nobility thought them innocent, and did solicitously deprecate their Punishments, and yet notwithstanding, the severe Cruelty of their Enemies prevailed more, than the former Demerits and good Offices of their Family; or, than the Kings Pardon ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd, or, than the interceding Supplications of the Nobility. And therefore he intreated all, who were there present, to look upon those lofty Titles of Empire and Dominion, to be nothing else but the Glosing Complements of Fortune, who then intended to do most Mischief; and that they were rather flowry Embelishments for ones Funeral, than Safeguards to a Man's Life; especially since Bad men can always do more to destroy the Good, than the Consent of the Good can do to save them.</q>
And having thus spoken, to the great grief of all the Spectators, he submitted his Neck to the Executioner.</p>

In this troublesome state of the Kingdom, the same Disease which vext others, did also infect the Ecclesiastical Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: <hi>Iames Cameron,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Glasco,</hi> had, himself, committed many acts of Cruelty and Avarice, upon the Husbandmen of his Diocess, (which was very large) and he had also given Encouragement to Those who were in power, to do the like, that so, when the Owners were unjustly condemn'd, their Estates might be Confiscated to him; so that, he was believ'd to be the Author, or the Favourer, of all the Mischiefs which were acted abroad. 'Tis reported, that the Man came to an End worthy of his wicked Life; The Day before the Nativity of <hi>Christ,</hi> as he was asleep in a Farm of his own, about 7 Miles from <hi>Glasco,</hi> he seem'd to hear a loud Voice calling him to the Tribunal of <hi>Christ,</hi> to plead his Cause.

Afterwards, when it sounded again more terribly and frightfully, than before, The Bishop gave a great groan, put out his Tongue, and was found Dead in his Bed. This so evident an Example of God's Vengeance, as I shall not rashly credit, so I have no mind to refute; yet, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deliver'd by others, and constantly affirmed to be true, I thought good not to omit it.</p>

               <p>After this Fight at <hi>Sarc,</hi> as the Borders of <hi>Scotland</hi> were quieter from the wrongs of their Enemies; so, when the matter was reported at <hi>London,</hi> it did rather irritate the <hi>English,</hi> than deject them: For, a Council being call'd about a War with <hi>Scotland,</hi>

Whilst they were all intent hereupon, presently Civil Wars arose amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and a strong Conspiracy of the Commons, made against the King, took off their Thoughts from a Foreign War; so that Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors were sent into <hi>Scotland,</hi> to treat of a Peace, which were so much the more welcome, because their own Affairs were not well settled at home. Yet they could not well agree on Terms of Peace, but only made a Truce for Three Years, and so returned home: These things were acted in the Year of Our <hi>Lord</hi> One Thousand Four Hundred Forty Eight.</p>
               <p>This Publick Joy was soon after increast by a Message, sent out of <hi>Flanders,</hi> from the Chancellor, who went Ambassador to <hi>Charles</hi> the Seventh,<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>This Universal Joy, for the Victory, for the Peace, and for the Marriage, was soon disturbed by the Death of <hi>Richard Colvill,</hi> a Man of Note; which, though perhaps, in it self, not undeserv'd, yet was of very bad Example to the Common-Wealth.

That he would Command the Earls Proctor, or Attorney, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear; that so, in his own Presence, a fair Tryal might be had.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, the Proctor was summon'd, but did not appear, so that the Kings Officers were sent out to bring him in by force; when he was brought to Court, some alledged, that he ought to be immediately punisht for disobeying the Kings Command; in regard, that, by too much Patience, the Kings Authority would be despis'd and run low, even amongst the meaner sort; for, under the pretence of Lenity,
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:56771:200"/>
the Audaciousness of the Bad would increase, and the Impunity of Offendors would open the way for more Crimes. The King was not mov'd by those Instigations, but remain'd constant to his Resolution, which was, rather to satisfie his greatest Accusers, by the Compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation of their Losses, than to satiate their Vindicative Minds, with the spilling of his Blood. Hereupon he caus'd the Earls Proctor to be brought out of Prison, and to plead in his Masters behalf, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him, That <hi>if he had any thing to allege in Purgation of the Crimes objected, he should freely declare it, without any fear at all.</hi> When he was cast in many Suits, and the King Commanded him immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to pay the Damages; The Proctor answer'd, <hi>He would defer the whole matter, till the return of the Earl, who was expected in a few Months.</hi> This he spake, as 'twas thought, by the advice of <hi>Ormond</hi> and <hi>Murray,</hi> the Earl's Brothers: When the King was inform'd of his Resolution,<note place="margin">Which are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered out of his Estate.</note> he sent <hi>William Sinclare,</hi> Earl of the <hi>Orcades,</hi> who was then Chancellor, first into <hi>Galway,</hi> and then into <hi>Douglasdale</hi>; he appointed Sequestrators to gather up the Rents of <hi>Douglas</hi>'s E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, and so to pay the Damages adjudg'd by Law. But in regard, <hi>Sinclare</hi> had not Power enough to inforce his Order, some eluded, others Contumeliously abus'd him, so that he return'd without ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting his Business.</p>
               <p>The King, being provokt by this Contempt of his Authority, Commands all the Favourers of <hi>Douglas</hi> his Faction to be Summon'd to appear, which they refusing to do, were declared Publick Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; an Army was Levy'd against them, which marcht into <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</hi> At their first coming, the Commanders were driven into their Castles, but a small Party of the Kings Forces, pursuing after the rest through Craggy Places, were repuls'd, and not without Ignominy driven back to the King. The King, taking it in great Indignation, that a few Vagabond Thieves should dare to make such Attempts, resolv'd to redeem their slighting of him, by attempting their Strongs Holds; he took the Castle of <hi>Maban,</hi> with no great difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but his Soldiers were so much toil'd and weary'd in the taking of <hi>Douglas Castle,</hi> that therefore he wholly demolisht it. As for the Vassals and Tenants who had submitted themselves, and their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes to him, he Commanded them to pay their Rents to his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surers, till <hi>Douglas</hi>'s Estate had fully satisfi'd what was awarded against him by Law. And when this was almost done, he dismist his Army, having obtain'd a good Report for his Lenity and Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, even amongst his very Enemies.</p>
               <p>When these Matters were related to the Earl at <hi>Rome,</hi> his great Spirit was mightily mov'd; yea, his Esteem did then abate amongst his own Attendants, so that a great Part of them deserted him, and he enter'd upon his Journy homewards, with but a few Followers. He came through <hi>England,</hi>

And when the King was appeasable, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd home, and was kindly receiv'd, only he was admonisht to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon and subdue all Robbers, especially those of <hi>Annandale,</hi> who had plaid many Cruel and Avaritious Pranks in his absence; <hi>Dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glas</hi> undertook to do so, and confirm'd his Promise by an Oath.
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:56771:200"/>
Whereupon, he was not only restor'd into his former Grace and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, but also made Regent over all <hi>Scotland,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">And made <hi>Regent.</hi>
                  </note> so that every one was injoin'd to obey his Commands.</p>
               <p>But his vast Mind, which was always hankering after Supremacy and Height, was not content with this Honour, which was the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est he could be advanced to, under the King; but, by his Temerity, he gave the State new Occasions of Suspicion: For he undertook a Journy, very privately, into <hi>England,</hi> and after his Address to that King, he told him, that the cause of his coming was, That <hi>his Estate,</hi>

The Queen also, and many of the Nobles, interceded for him; and after a Solemn Oath, that, for the future, he would never act any thing which might justly offend the King, his Fault was forgiven; only he was deprived of his Office. Whereupon the Earl of the <hi>Orcades,</hi> and <hi>William Creighton,</hi> who had always remained Loyal, were advanc'd again, to sit at the Helm.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Douglas</hi> was very angry with all the Courtiers for this Disgrace, (for so he interpreted it) but he was most of all incens'd against <hi>William Creighton,</hi> for, he thought, that 'twas by his Prudence, that all his Projects were disappointed, and therefore he was resolv'd to dispatch him out of the World, either by some Treachery; or, if that succeeded not, by any other way, whatsoever.

                  <hi>Douglas,</hi> being thus freed from an unlook'd for Danger, either out of Fear, Shame, or Both, when he saw the Power of the Adverse Faction to increase with the good liking of the People, endeavour'd also to strengthen his own Party, as much as ever he could, and therefore he joins himself in League with the Earls of <hi>Craford</hi> and <hi>Ross,</hi> which were the most Noted and Potent Families in <hi>Scotland,</hi> next to the <hi>Douglas</hi>'s; a mutual Oath was entred into betwixt them; <hi>That each of them should be aiding and assisting to the Friends, and Confederates, one of another.</hi> And, in Confidence of this Combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they slighted the Forces of their opposite Faction; yea, and the Kings, too. The King took this in great Indignation; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, he had other fresh Causes of Provocation against him, which hastned his Destruction. <hi>Iohn Herris,</hi> a Knight, of a Noble Family in <hi>Galway,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">He provokes the King,</note> being averse from the ill Practices of the <hi>Douglas</hi>'s, ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily kept himself within the Walls of his own House; but the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nandians</hi> were sent in upon him, which did him much mischief; he often complain'd hereof to <hi>Douglas,</hi> but in vain; so that, at length, he determin'd to revenge himself, and to repel Force by Force. And accordingly, he gather'd a Company of his Friends together; and, entring <hi>Annandale,</hi> he, and all his Followers, were there taken Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners by those <hi>Bandity,</hi> and being brought to <hi>Douglas,</hi> he hang'd him up as a Thief; though the King had earnestly interceded for him, by his Letters. That matter seem'd very hainous, as indeed it was; so that Speeches were given out, <hi>That</hi> Douglas, <hi>by evil Practices, did endeavour, and that not obscurely, to make his Way to the Crown; for-now there was nothing else remaining,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In the Case of <hi>Herris,</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>which could satisfie his vast and aspiring Mind</hi>; Which Suspicion was soon after increast by another Fact, which he committed, as foul, as the former. There was a certain Family of the <hi>Macklan</hi>'s in <hi>Galway,</hi> one of the best and chiefest, there: The prime Person of that Family had slain one of <hi>Douglas</hi> his Attendants, from whom he had received continual Wrongs and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts, whereupon, he and his Brother were, by <hi>Douglas,</hi> cast into Prison: The King being made acquainted with it, was very much importun'd by the Friends of the Prisoners, not to suffer so Noble, and otherwise a very honest Man, to be hal'd forth, not to a Legal Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, but to an undoubted Destruction, the same Man being both his Capital Enemy and his Judge too;<note place="margin">And <hi>Mack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan.</hi>
                  </note> and that it was not his present Crimes, which did prejudice him so much, as that he had always been of the Honest or Royal Party. Hereupon, the King sent <hi>Patrick Gray, Macklan</hi>'s Uncle, a worthy Knight, and Kin also to <hi>Douglas,</hi> to Command him to send the Pris'ner to Court, that the Matter might be Tryed there, in due course of Law. The Earl receiv'd <hi>Gray</hi> very courteously, but, in the mean time, he caused Execution to be done upon the Pris'ner, and intreated <hi>Gray</hi> to excuse him to the King, as if it had been done by his Officers, without his Knowledge: But he, perceiving how manifestly he was deluded, was in such a Rage, that he told <hi>Douglas,</hi> That from that Day forward, he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all Alliance, Friendship, or any other Obligation to him, and
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:56771:201"/>
was resolv'd to be his perpetual Enemy, and do him all the Mischief he could; when the news hereof was brought to Court, the Fact seem'd so unworthy to all that heard it, that Speeches were openly scatter'd, That now <hi>Douglas</hi> did exceed the bounds of a Subject, and plainly carry'd himself as a King; For, to what other purpose else did his Combinations with the Earls of <hi>Craford, Ross, Murray,</hi> and <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> tend? And moreover, his private Discourse with the King of <hi>England,</hi> his putting Good Men to Death, and his allow'd Licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness in pillaging the People, were Indications of the same Design: Now, Innocency was accounted Cowardize, and Loyalty to the King punish'd as Perfidiousness; that the Enemys of the Common-wealth grew insolent, by the overmuch Indulgence of the King; That 'twas time for him now to take the Reins of Government into his own Hand, and to act as a King, himself; and then it would appear, who were his Friends, and who were his Enemies; or, if he did not dare to do it openly, by reason of the Powerfulness of some Men; yet, by some private way or other, he should punish Treachery; but, if he were so fearful, as not to do so, neither; what remain'd, but that they, who had hitherto been constant in their Loyalty to him, should now at length provide for themselves? These Discourses, thÃ´ the Life of the <hi>Douglas</hi>'s, and the Credulity of the King, (prone to Sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion) did confirm to be true: Yet the King, out of his innate Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency, or else, having, before, laid his Design, se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Hereupon, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move this his Fear, many of the Nobles about the King sent him a Schedule with their Hands and Seals to it, promising upon Oath, that if the King himself should meditate any thing against his Life, yet they would dismiss him in safety; so that <hi>Douglas,</hi>

After Supper, with great hilarity, was end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the King took him aside into his Bed-chamber, with but a few of his Confidents, he did not so much as admit Those, to whom he was wont to communicate his most secret Counsels. There, he ript up, from the very beginning, the Loyalty and Valour of his Ancestors, and his own Indulgence towards their Family; and especially towards himself; who, having committed many hainous Offences, either by the Greenness of his Years, or by the Persuasions of wicked Men, he had freely pardon'd; always hoping, that either by his courteous Clemency toward him, or else by the Maturity of his Age he would be Reform'd; and as yet, says he, I despair not, but it may be so; and, if you repent of what you have impiously committed, the door of my Clemency shall never be shut against you. This last League (proceeded he) with <hi>Craford</hi> and <hi>Ross,</hi> as it is not Creditable for

of the Lands of all those, who were Loyal to the King; they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieg'd the Castle of <hi>Dalkeith,</hi> and took an Oath not to depart from it, till they had taken it; for they were very Angry with <hi>Iohn,</hi> the Owner of it, because he, and the Earl of <hi>Angus,</hi> had separated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from the Counsels of the rest of the <hi>Douglasses</hi>; The Siege lasted longer than they expected, for <hi>Patrick Cockburn,</hi> Commander of the Garison, made a strenuous Resistance against all the Efforts of the Enemy; So that, after they had lost a great many men, they were worn out with Toils and Watchings, and so broke up the Siege. In the mean time, the King levied an Army, to relieve his distressed Friends, but seeing he had not Strength enough to encounter the <hi>Douglasses,</hi> he resolv'd to wait the coming in of <hi>Alexander Gordon,</hi> to his assistance, who had levy'd a good Force in the Northern Parts, and was marching towards him; but as he was coming thro <hi>Angus, Craford,</hi> with a considerable Body, met and oppos'd him at <hi>Brechin,</hi> where a sharp Battel was fought, betwixt them; when the King's main Battel was giving ground, as not able to indure the shock of the <hi>Angusians, Iohn Colace,</hi> who commanded the Left Wing, forsook <hi>Craford</hi>; having born him a Grudge, and so left the main Body of the Army naked. Hereupon, those who were almost Conquerors, being struck with terrour, turn'd their Backs and sled away. Thus <hi>Gordon</hi> unexpectedly got the Victory, yet with much loss on his side, his two Brothers, and a great Number of his Friends and Followers being Slain; of the <hi>Angusians</hi> also, there fell several men of Note; and, amongst the rest, the Earl's own Brother. As for the Earl him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, he turn'd his Wrath from the Enemy to those who had deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him, he storm'd their Castles, and spoil'd their Lands with Fire and Sword; and he had the better Opportunity so to do, because that <hi>Gordon</hi> made a speedy Return into his own Country, when he heard, that the Earl of <hi>Murray</hi> was exercising all manner of Cruelty against his own Territories; so that, he was forced to march back with his Victorious Army, where he not only revenged his Loss upon his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, but also quite expell'd him out of his Country of <hi>Murray.</hi> These things were acted toward the End of the Spring.</p>
               <p>In the interim, the King, by the advice, chiefly of <hi>Iames Kennedy,</hi> caus'd an Assembly of the Estates to meet at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> to which he Summon'd, by an Herald, the Earl of <hi>Douglas,</hi>

                  </hi> the Earls late Wife, and <hi>Alexander,</hi> Earl of <hi>Craford,</hi> were declar'd Publick Enemies to the Common-wealth.

Soldiers could not then keep the Field, and an Expedition was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed against the Spring.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, <hi>Iames Douglas,</hi> left the wealth of his Family, which was mightily increas'd,<note place="margin">

This Year, and the next following, there was Bandying between the Parties, Lands were pillag'd, some Castles overthrown; but they came not to decide the main Controversy in a Set Battel; the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test Part of the damage fell on the Countys of <hi>Annandale, Foress,</hi> and the Neighbouring Countys of the <hi>Douglasses</hi>: After this Devastation of the Lands,<note place="margin">A Famine and Pestilence in <hi>Scotland.</hi>

                     <hi>Douglas</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded to a Reconciliation with the King.</note> as His was, to be extirpated by his Obstinacy; nor betray the Lives of so many brave Men, who follow'd his Party; neither yet bring them to that Point of Necessity, that, after having suffer'd so many Calamities, they should be forc'd to make Terms for themselves: Whilst he was in a good Condition, he might make an easy Pacification; but, if once his Friends deserted him, there would then be no Hope for him to obtain his Pardon. The Man, being in his Youthful Age, and of a Fierce Disposition too,<note place="margin">Which he refuses.</note> made Answer, <hi>That he would never submit himself to their Power, who were restrain'd by no Bonds of Modesty, nor by any divine or human Law; who under fair Promises had inticed his Cosins, and his Brother to come to them, and then, perfidiously and cruelly. Slew them: In a Word, he would suffer the height of all Extremities before he would ever put himself into their hands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This his Answer was either approv'd, or dislik'd, according to every Man's Humour; Those who were Violent, or who made a Gain of the publick Miseries, commended the Greatness of his Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage; but the Wiser sort persuaded him to take Opportunity by the Forelock, lest, after his Friends had forsaken him, he might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, that he had neglected the Time for a Pacification, when 'twas not to be redeem'd, which is usually the end of Headlong Counsels. But the Earl of <hi>Craford,</hi> being weary'd out with so long a War, and withal, considering with himself the very Unjustness of his Cause, together with the common Mutations of human Life, as also know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Pardon might easily be Obtain'd, if he did preoccupy the Kings Favour; but very difficultly, if he stood it out; and besides, being forsaken by some of his Friends, and suspecting the Fidelity of the rest, put himself into such an Habit, as might most move Pity, and thus bare-headed &amp; bare-footed, in most humble manner, he came to the King, as he was passing thro' <hi>Angus</hi>; he ingeniously confest the offences of his former Life; he cast himself and all his concerns upon the King's Mercy, having first prefaced something concerning
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:56771:203"/>
the Fidelity and good Services which his Ancestors had performed to their Kings; he was conscious,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Craford</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sakes <hi>Douglas,</hi> and is pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the King.</note> that his fault had deserv'd the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of Punishment, but whatsoever hereafter he had either of Life or Fortune, it would be a Debt wholly due to the Kings Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency. Having spoken these, and other words, of the same import not without Fear, all the Spectators were much moved and affected, especially some of the Nobility of <hi>Angus,</hi> and tho' they themselves had, in former times, followed the Kings Party, yet they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing, that so eminent and ancient a Family should be destroy'd. <hi>Iames Kennedy</hi> carry'd himself, at the same time, like a good Bishop and a Friendly Patriot, for he not only forgave the Earl the many grievous Injuries he had done him, but further commended his Suit, and spake in his Favour, to the King, for he foresaw, as it after hapned, That, by this Accession, the Kings Party, would be streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then'd, and his Enemies weaken'd daily, for the future; in regard many were likely to follow the Example of this Great Man. And besides, the King thinking, that his former Fierceness was tam'd, and that he was really penitent for what he had done, was not hard to be intreated, but gave him his Pardon, restor'd him to his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Estate and Honour, only advis'd him, for the future, to keep within the Bounds of his Duty: And indeed, <hi>Craford,</hi> being thus ingag'd by the Lenity and Facileness of the King, did afterwards en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to perform him all the Service he possibly could, he followed him with his Forces in his March to the furthest Parts of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and having setled Things there for the present, he entertained him nobly at his House, in his return, and when he march'd to make a full end of the Civil War, he promis'd him all the Force, he could make; and, indeed, the whole course of his Life was so chang'd, that, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down his former Savageness, he liv'd courteously, and in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaisance, with the Neighbouring Nobility; so that his Death, which followed soon after, brought the greater Grief to the King and to all the People.</p>

<q>That his many Crimes were very evident, but he had discover'd no <hi>Specimen</hi> of a chang'd Mind in him; if they would have the Penitence, which they pretended in Words, to be believ'd as really True and Hearty, he should make Restitution for the Loss, he had formerly caus'd; and restore their Estates to such, as he had outed of them; and thus to cancel the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of his former Mischiefs, by some Eminent and Loyal Service. 'Tis true (said he) no Virtue becomes a King more than Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency, but Care must be had, lest the Reins of Government be not let loose by too much Lenity; and so Evil Men rather made more insolent, than Good Men excited to their Duty, thereby; that he would give Time to <hi>Donald,</hi> and his Party to manifest by some To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens, that they repented of their Miscarriages, and that they should always find him towards them, such as their Actions and their Words did Declare them to be.

Whereupon she left her Son at <hi>Berwick,</hi> and she and her Husband entred <hi>Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> where she made great Devastation, by Fire and Sword, in all the adjacent Parts.

                  <hi>Henry</hi> thought it best, in such a desperate Case, to put it to a Push, and accordingly a Fight begun, wherein he was overthrown, his chief Friends were either slain, or taken Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners, and he himself made an hasty Retreat to <hi>Berwick</hi>; of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners, some had their Heads cut off presently; and some, a while after. <hi>Edward</hi> having thus got the Day, by the Generals of his Forces, came himself to <hi>Durham,</hi> that so he might prevent the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursions of the <hi>Scots</hi> by the Terrour of his Neighbouring Army; and also, that, by his Presence, he might quell any Domestick Insur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, if any such should happen.

But the <hi>Scots</hi> having lately had ill success in <hi>England,</hi> an Army could not be so soon levyed, as the present Exigent required, for the raising of the Siege; insomuch, that whilst others were backward, and delayed to give in their Opinion, <hi>George,</hi> Earl of <hi>Angus,</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took, with great Audacity, the Matter, which was so full of hazard. He collected about 10000 Horse, of his Friends, Vassals, and the Neighbouring Province, of which he was Governor; He came to the Castle, and Horsed the <hi>French,</hi> that were in Garison, upon some empty Horses he had brought for that purpose, and so brought them off safe, even to a Man, into <hi>Scotland,</hi> whilst the <hi>English</hi> stood and looked on, as amazed at the Boldness of his Miraculous Enterprize;

or, thinking that <hi>Douglas</hi> had help near at hand; or rather, hoping to have the Castle given up without a Battel, and so they would not put the Whole to an hazard, by joining in Fight with that small, though select, Party. <hi>Edward</hi> settled Guards at all convenient Places, that so, no Rebellious Troops might march to and again; and then, as if he had quieted the whole Kingdom, he returned to <hi>London.</hi>

The Queen lodged in the Castle; the Bishop and the Earl lay in the Abby of <hi>Holy-Road-House,</hi> at the furthest part of the Suburbs, towards the East.

               <p>But when the Month was expired, their Minds were a little cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; and, the Truce ended, there was another Convention, where the Queen alleged This for her self, in Justification of her Cause,
<q>That, seeing she had not entred upon the Government the Year before by Force, or against the minds of the Nobility, but was cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen to that Dignity by th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If, (said she) as it is usual, Degrees of Affinity be regarded in Pupil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages, there is none nearer than a Mother; if the Safety of the King were Ey'd, none could be more Faithful; for if the King should die, other men may have their various and distinct Hopes, but she could hope for, or expect, nothing but Orbity, Solitariness, and Tears. And, if they had respect to the Good of the Publick, she was a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and concerned in no Interest of Feuds or Friendships, and That was especially to be eyed in such who sate at the Helm of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; That so their own Lives might not only be free from actual Vice; but also, that they might have as few Temptations, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citements as may be, to those Lusts, which do disturb and hurry the Mind, and pervert righteous Judgment. Some had Assistance of Parents, Kinsmen, Allies, by whose aid they might hope for an Excuse for their Offences, or, at least, an easier Pardon. Yea, sometimes the Rulers were compelled to square and accommodate their Actions to such mens Wills and Humours. As for Her self, her Hope of Defence was in Innocency alone; She had but one Son to eye, and both their Benefits and Advantages were combined and twisted together. And unless she had respect to these Things, she would choose much rather to live a quiet and happy Life in Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the good Liking of all, than to u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

sithence, not only in <hi>Britain,</hi> but even in the Greatest and most Puissant Kingdoms of the Continent, Women have had the Supreme Power, and their Reigns have been Such, that their Subjects never repented of their Government.</q>
               </p>
               <p>When she had thus spoken, Many assented to her; Some to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possess a Place in in her future Grace and Favour; Others, in Hopes, that the Fruits of another's Envy would redound to their advantage; Yea, there were some, who had an evil jealousy, That, if the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on should be made out of All, they themselves might be passed by, as less fit; and therefore, they rather desired, that the Queen should be preferred over them all, than that Others, of the same Order with themselves, or even of a Superiour one, should be preferred before Them.</p>
               <p>Nowithstanding, the more uncorrupted Part of the Nobility did, both by their Countenance and Speeches, highly disgust the Queens Oration; but that which did most Vehemently affect the whole As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly, was, the Authority and the Speech of <hi>Iames Kennedy,</hi> who, as 'tis reported, spake in this manner.</p>
               <p>IT is my chief Desire, Noble Peers, That they whose aims are at the Good of all, in general,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Kennedys</hi> Grave and Prolix Orati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in Answer thereunto.</note> might freely declare their minds without offence to any one particular Person. But, in our present Circumstances, when things spoke for publick Advantage are distor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Reproach of those private persons, who speak them, it is a very difficult thing to observe such a Mean between disagreeing heats, and different opinions, as not to incur the offence of one of the Parties. As for me, I will so temper and moderate my Discourse, That no man shall complain of me, without first confessing his own Guilt. Yet, I shall use the Liberty of Speech, received from our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors, so modestly, that, as, on the <hi>One</hi> side, I desire to prejudice no man; so, on the <hi>Other,</hi> neither for Fear nor Favour, will I preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any thing, which is of use in the Debate before us; I see<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> That there are <hi>Two</hi> Opinions which do retard and impede our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord; The <hi>One,</hi> is, of Those, who judge, That in a matter relating to the Good of All, an Election out of All is to be made; and as we all meet to give our Suffrages in a business concerning the safety of the whole Kingdom; so, it is equal and fit, that no man should be Excluded from the Hopes of that Honour, who seeks after it by Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest and Virtuous Ways. The <hi>Other,</hi> is, of such, who count it a great Injury done to the Queen, who is so noble a Princess, and so choice a Woman, if she be not preferred before all others in the Tutelage of her Son, and the Administration of the Government of the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Of these Two Opinions, I like the Former best, and I will shew you my Reasons for it, by and by: In the mean time, I so far ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the design of the Later, That they think it below the Queen's Grandeur, That any Single Person should Vye with her for this point of Honour, lest her Authority, which ought to be, as it indeed is, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted Venerable, should be lessned by coping with Inferiours. And, indeed, I would be quickly of their mind, if the Dispute lay here, about the Honour of <hi>One,</hi> and not the Safety of <hi>All.</hi> But, seeing
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:56771:210"/>
that, this day, we are to make a Determination about That which concerns the Lives &amp; Fortunes of all private men, and the Safety of the whole Kingdom, too; it is fit, that all Single Interests, and Concerns, should stoop and truckle under That: And therefore, I earnestly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise Those, that are of this Opinion, so to consult the Dignity of the Queen, That, in the interim, they forget not the Reverence they owe to the Laws, to the old Customs, and, to the Universal Good of their Country; if they can shew, by any Statute, That it is Lawful and Publickly expedient, That the Guardianship of the King, and the Regency of the Kingdom, ought to be in the Queens Hands, I will pass over into their Opinion. But if their Orations be pernicious to the Publick, I hope the Queen, <hi>first</hi>; and <hi>next,</hi> all Good men will pardon me, if (always saving the Majesty of the Queen, as Sacred, so far as, by Law, and the Custom of our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors, I may) I do not conceal my Opinion, or, rather, if I speak out That, with Freedom, which it were the greatest Impiety in me to conceal. To begin then with the Laws; There is a Law made 500 year ago, by King <hi>Kenneth,</hi> a Prince no less eminent for his Wisdom and Prudence, than for his military Performances; and it was assented and yielded to by All the Orders of the Kingdom; and approved of, even to this very day, by the Constant Observance of so many Ages, <hi>That, when the King was in his Minority, the Estates, or Parliament, of the Kingdom should Assemble and choose some one Man, eminent for Wisdom and Power, to be his Guardian, and to Govern the Kingdom, whilst he was yet unable to weild the Scepter, with his Own hands.</hi> Tho' this Law be referred to <hi>Kenneth,</hi> as the Author of it; yet, it seems to me, That he did not so much Enact it <hi>first,</hi> as, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, revive and confirm the Ancient Custom of the <hi>Scots,</hi> by a <hi>New</hi> Sanction. For, Our Ancestors were so far from Committing the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Power into the Hands of a Woman, That, if you look over all our Chronicles, you shall not find so much as the Name of a <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Regent,</hi> recorded therein; for, why, pray, should they mention such a Name, of which, they thought, they had no need, at present; &amp; hoped, they should never have any for the Future? For those Females which other Countrys call <hi>Queens,</hi> we only call <hi>Wives</hi> (or <hi>Consorts</hi>) of our Kings; neither do we entitle Them to any Higher Name; for, I judge, our Wise Ancestors had This in their Eye, That, as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as they heard their Names mentioned with the Adjunct of <hi>Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,</hi> they might remember, That they were obnoxious and Subject to men. And therefore, to this very day, a Woman was never admitted to the Regency, or the Administration of Publick Affairs. The same Course hath been also constantly observed in lesser Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracys, both as to their Appointments and Executions. For, tho' many Honours and some Seigniorys amongst them have come by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance to some Women, by reason of their Great deserts from their Country; and have also been allotted to them, as Dowrys; yet it was never known, since the memory of man, That any Woman did ever preside in any Publick Council, or in any Court of Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or to have taken upon her any of those Offices, which are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to men. Which Custom, seeing our Ancestors, tho' not bound by Law thereunto, did constantly observe, only by the Impulse
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:56771:210"/>
of Nature, if we their Posterity should cast the Common-wealth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an apparent Danger, by opposing a Law, received by the Votes of all, and approved by so long an Usage, Who will free us from the Brand (I will not say, of Tomerity, but) even of Madness it self? Especially, since we have been warned by Examples near at hand; For the <hi>Saxons,</hi> by reason of the Wickedness of one Woman, <hi>viz. Ethelburga</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> made a Law, That, after that time, no Woman should be called <hi>Queen,</hi> nor should fit in Publick, next the King, in any Seat of Honour. I beseech you therefore, consider seriously, how much they degenerate from Their Prudence, who against a Law so Ancient, and as advantageous to Women, as honourable to Men, would put the Reins of Government into Their hands, to whom our Ancestors never gave so much as a Royal Name; and from whom our Neighbours, after they had given it, took it away. Other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, I grant, have been of another Opinion; with what Success I shall declare, after I have first answered Those, who dare not calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niate this Law, openly; but, in the Carpet-Conventicles of Women, do implead it, as unjust. But whosoever he be, that finds Fault with it, he seems to reprehend, not some Sanction only, appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the suffrages of Men, but even Nature it self, <hi>i. e.</hi> That Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary Law, imprinted in our hearts by God himself; I say, Nature it self, whom our Law-maker had, as a Guide, and Directress of all his Counsels, when he proposed and enacted this Law. For Nature, from the beginning, hath not only distinguished Men from Women by the strength of Mind and Body, but hath also appropriated distinct Offices and Virtues to each Sex, the same indeed for Kind, but far different in Degree; For, how is it less uncomely for a Woman to pronounce Judgment, to levy Forces, to Conduct an Army, to give a Signal to the Battel, than for a Man to teiz Wool, to handle the Distaff, to Spin or Card, and to perform the other Services of the weaker Sex: That which is Liberality, Fortitude, and Severity in Men, is Profusion, Madness and Cruelty in a Woman. And again, That which is Elegant, Comely, and Ornamental in a Woman, is Mean, Sordid, and Effeminate in a Man: They that endeavour to confound and mix these things, which Nature, of her own accord, hath distinguished, do they not seem to you, not only to disturb, but also to overthrow, the State of the Kingdom, which is founded upon so good Laws and Customs? This they do, when they would obtrude on us the Government of a Woman, which our Ancestors did not so much as once Name. For the Maker of that Law (as I told you before) doth not seem so much to induce a new Sanction in the Enacting thereof, as only to commit to Writing the perpetual Usage of our Ancestors, that it might be transmitted to Posterity; and, That which hath been always observed by the Guidance of Nature, in the making a King, to have consecrated the same Thing to be observed by Publick Authority, in choosing a Guardian for a King, under age. They which go about to undermine and infringe this one Law, what do they thereby but endeavour to overthrow all the other Laws, Rites and Customs of our Ancestors? I speak this, (that I may prevent all Calum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>y) not that I think all Laws are immutable, as if they were enacted to last for ever; No, Laws
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:56771:211"/>
are of different Sorts and Kinds: Those which are accommodated to the Vicissitude of Times, are subject to the Inconstancy of Fortune, and are wont to last so long, as the Necessity doth, which imposed them; and Those which are obtruded on men by the Wills of Tyrants, are commonly disannulled and abrogated, with their Authors. But as for that Instinct or Impress of Nature, which is, as it were, a Living Law, ordained by God, and deeply imprinted and engraven in Mens hearts, That, the Consent of no Multitudes, nor no mens Decrees, can abolish. For (as an excellent Poet is reported to have said) <hi>it was not born yesterday or to day, but it grew up together with Dame Nature it self, and lives and dies together with it.</hi> And seeing the Law, of which we now speak, is of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hat sort, and a Principal one, too, he doth not oppose the Dignity of the Queen, who desires, That she of her own accord would prescribe to her self those Bounds, which Nature it self hath appointed, her Sex requires, Custom al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, and the Laws, made by the consent of almost all Nations, do approve: But they, who would have her forget her Sex and Station, do persuade her to break thro' all Bonds of Law, and to disturb the Order of things appointed by God, received by use, and allowed in all Cities and Countrys, well-governed: And, certainly, whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver slights that Order will be grievously punished, not by Men only, but by God himself, who will revenge his own Law. For, if good Laws threaten a Man with Death, who shall cloath himself with a Womans Apparel; and a Woman, if she wear the Habit of a Man, what Punishment can be inflicted on them, too great for their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, who, by a preposterous Flattery, would overthrow the whole Force of Nature, and the everlasting Constitution of God himself? Will you understand, how these Flatterers do not speak what they cordially mean? In a publick Assembly, to give a Vote, to be Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident in a Court of Law, to enact or abrogate a Law: These are Great Things in themselves, yet they are but a small Portion of the Government. Why do they not bring their Wives hither to us, to consult? Why do not these also preside in Judicatures? Why do they not persuade, or dissuade, Laws? Why do not they themselves look after their Domestick Affairs, at home? And, Why do they not send their Wives abroad to the War? But if they would impose Those Regents upon us, whom they themselves dare scarcely trust in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of their own Houshold Affairs, much less think them fit for the least Part of any Publick Business: Consider, I pray, how they contradict themselves; but if they themselves are conscious of their own Infirmity, if they speak as they think, and so are restrain'd by Modesty rather than Judgment; yet, let them hope well of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who both can, and will, perform their own, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Services proper for Men, But if (as I rather judge) They think, by this kind of Complyance, to gratify the Queen, I advise and admonish them, to lay aside that false Opinion of a Princess of so great Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as she is, nor, that they would believe her to be so ignorant of Things, as to account, That to be an Increase and Accession of Dignity, (to her) which would be the foulest thing imaginable, in other Women. I enter upon this Part of my Discourse very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly; For, seeing our Noble Princess hath so well deserved of
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:56771:211"/>
the whole Kingdom, that it is fit she should hear nothing, which might justly offend her Ears and Spirit. I will not mention those things, which ill Men do commonly allege in contemning and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervaluing of that Sex, I shall rather insist on those Virtues, which are proper to the Queen: And tho' these are Many and eminently Illustrious; yet none of them have procur'd greater Praise and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation to her, than her Modesty. For, That is esteemed so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to her Sex, that, even in a private person, it doth either cover, or, at least, much extenuate, other Faults. But, in our Princess, none of whose Words or Deeds, in regard of the Eminency of her Stock and Condition, can be concealed, it doth shine out so illustrious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that her other Virtues come much more acceptable, and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, upon the Account thereof. And therefore I shall need to say but a few words in reference to her, save only to warn and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage her, to persist in That way to Glory and Honour, which she hath already entred upon; and that she would not give Ear to the Flatteries of any, so as to be forgetful of Her self; but that she would rather tread the sure and experienced way to immortal Renown, than by running on unsafe and craggy Precipices, to hazard the Splendor of her former glorious Life.</p>
               <p>But my great Business, is, with you (My Lords,) who, either out of Envy, are afraid that your Betters should be preferr'd before you; or else, by wicked Ambition, do lay the Foundation of your future Favour with a good Princess. I will therefore, most Noble Queen, under the shelter of your Prudence, speak, and speak free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, my Thoughts, in this case. Such Persons do not Accost, or Court You, but your Fortune: And whilst they think upon the Queen, they forget, that the same Person is a <hi>Woman.</hi> When I name the Word <hi>Woman,</hi> (I do not use it reproachfully) but I mean a Person to whom Nature hath given many Blandishments, and eminent En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments; but withal, hath mingled them (as She usually doth, in the most beautiful and preciousest things) with some allay of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity; and therefore would have her to be under the Guardian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of Another; as not sufficiently able to protect Herself: So that, She is so far from having an Empire over others allotted to her; That the Laws, in Imitation of Nature, do Command Women to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the perpetual Tutelage of their Parents, Brothers, or Husbands. Neither doth this tend to their Reproach, but is a Relief to their Frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. For, that it keeps them off from those Affairs, for which they are unfit; it is a Courtesie which consults, or makes Provision for, their Modesty; not a Scandal, detracting from their Honour. I will not call to remembrance, how difficultly they are restrained by the Diligence of Husbands, and the Authority of Parents; neither will I mention, how far the Licentiousness of some Women hath proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when the Reins have been loosed on their Necks. I shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine my Speech only to what the present Case offers; yea, what it doth exact and require, and which, without Damage to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, cannot be concealed: If there be any thing of private Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience in the Sex, let their Husbands and Kin lock to that, I shall only briefly touch, what may be Publickly prejudicial. Greatness of Mind was never required in this Sex; it is true, Women have
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:56771:212"/>
other proper Virtues, but as for This, it was always reckoned amongst <hi>Virile,</hi> not <hi>Female,</hi> Endowments; besides, by how much the more they are obnoxious to Commotions, Passions, and other efforts of Mind, by reason of the Imbecillity of their Nature, by so much, doth their Extravagancy, having once broke thro' the restraints of the Law, straggle further away, and is hardly ever reduced, and brought back again within its due Bounds; in regard, Women are alike im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient, both of Diseases, and Remedies, too: But if any of them seem more valiant and couragious, they are so much the more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, as being lyable to more impetuous and vehement Passions: For they, who, out of tediousness of their Sex, have put off the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, are very willing to extend their Liberty, even beyond the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cincts of Manly Cares, too; If you once exceed, and pass over the Mound, and Limits, set by Nature, whatsoever is beyond is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, and there is no Boundary left either for Desire or Action: Moreover, there is a further Accession to this Infirmity of Nature, by how much the less Confidence one hath in himself, so much the more easily he interprets the Words and Actions of others to his own Reproach; he is more vehemently Angry, and more hardly appeas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Such a Party doth also execute Revenge more immoderately, and doth punish his Despisers, with greater Hate: Now that all those things are unfit for, yea, contrary to, Magistracy, there is none of you are ignorant of. And if any Man think, that I devise these things of my own Head, let him consider, What great Disturbances there were not long ago, when <hi>Ioan</hi> of <hi>Naples</hi> Reigned. Look over the Histories of Ancient Times. I will not mention <hi>Semiramis</hi> of <hi>Assyria,</hi> nor <hi>Laodice</hi> of <hi>Cappadocia</hi>; Those were Monsters, not Women.<note place="margin">Queen of <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mira,</hi> a City in <hi>Syria,</hi> now cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Faid.</hi>
                  </note> I shall only mention, That <hi>Zenobia Palmirena</hi> so much spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, the subduer of the <hi>Parthians,</hi> and Defender of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, was at last Overcome, Taken, and Triumphed over: And so She herself, and her Kingdom, which was enlarged, and increas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by her Husband <hi>Odenatus,</hi> was lost in a moment.</p>
               <p>Neither may I pass over in silence, what is principally to be regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in the management of other Mens Affairs; That the Chief Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand is not to be intrusted to such sort of Persons, who are not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable for their Mal-Administration: I do not at all distrust the Disposition, Faithfulness, nor Care of the Queen; but if any thing be acted amiss (as it often happens) by the Fraud of others; and Matters be carried otherwise, than the Publick Good, or the Dignity of Her Place doth Require, What Mulct can we exact from the Kings Mother? What Punishment can we require? Who shall give an account for Miscarriages? The Highest Matters will then be man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged in the Meetings of Women; in the Nursery or Dressing Room: You must <hi>There,</hi> either each Man in particular subscribe to Decrees; or All in General Make them; and She, whom you scarce now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain, tho' She be without Arms, and obnoxious to you by Laws and Customs, when you have, by your Authority, put Power into Her hands, you will certainly feel Her Womanish Wilfulness and Extravagance? Neither do I speak this, as if I did fear any such thing from our Queen, who is the Choicest and Modestest of all Women; but because, I think it base and unseemly for us, who have
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:56771:212"/>
all things, yet, in our own Hands and Power, to place the Hope of our Safety, which we may owe to our Selves, only in anothers Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, especially, since both Divine and Human Laws, the Custom of our Ancestors, yea, and the Consent of all Nations, throughout the whole World, make for us. 'Tis true, some Nations have endured Women to be their Chief Magistrates, but they were not elected to that Dignity, by their Judgment and Suffrage, but were cast upon them by the Lot of their Birth and Nativity; but never any People, who had freedom of Vote, when there was plenty of able Men to chuse, did ever prefer Women before Them. And therefore, most Eminent Patriots, I advise, and earnestly intreat, you, That, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Laws of our Country, and the Customs of our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors, we chuse One; or, if you think fit, More, the Best out of the Noblest and Best, who may undertake the Regency, till the King arrive at that strength both of Body and Mind, as to be able to manage the Government, Himself. And I pray God to Bless your Proceedings herein.</p>

                  </note>In another part of the Country, <hi>Donald,</hi> the Islander, as being a more powerful Person, began to make a far greater Commotion; for, after the Kings Death, as free from Fear, and judging, That turbulent state of things to be a fit Opportunity for him to injure his Inferiors, and to increase his own power, he came to <hi>Enverness,</hi> with no great Train, and was kindly invited into the Castle, by the Governor thereof; who had no Thoughts, or so much as the least Fear, of any Hostility from him; when he was entred, he turned out the Gari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, seized upon the Castle, and gathering his <note n="*" place="margin">Or, <hi>Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shanks.</hi>

That Church was venerated in those Parts with great Ceremony, and it had remain'd inviolate, to that very day, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the great Opinion of its Sanctity; but the consideration of Gain was more prevalent with that Savage and Avaritious Person, than any sense of Religion. For he violently pull'd out the Earl and his Wife from thence, and a great Number of Prisoners, besides; and after he had pillag'd the Church, he burnt it with Fire; and when the Priests spake to him, to deter him from that Sacriledge, some of them he slew, others he sent away, evilly enough intreated. Then having wasted the adjacent Countries, up and down, with Fire and Sword, he was returning home, with a great Booty, but a sudden Tempest arose, which sunk many of his Ships, and grievously distrest the rest; so that he, and a Few only of his Followers were rather cast up, than landed, on the Island of <hi>Ila</hi>; they, which superviv'd this Shipwrack, thought, That this Calamity happened to them by the manifest Anger of the Deity, because they had violated the Church of St. <hi>Bride</hi>; and therefore they went bare-footed, and cover'd only with a little Linen Garment, in an humble manner to carry Gifts to her, whom, a few days before, they had so contumeliously abus'd: 'Tis reported, That, from that day forward, <hi>Donald,</hi> their Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,

               <p>When the News hereof was brought to Court, it broke off their Consultations, of making any Expedition against the <hi>Islanders.</hi> The first Tumults being thus appeas'd, the Administration of <hi>Scotish</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs was carried on with so much Equity and Tranquillity, that the oldest Man, then alive, never remembred more secure, quiet, and halcyon, days; such was the Prudence and Gravity of <hi>Iames Kenne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> (on whose Authority the Court did then principally depend,<note place="margin">

For, this <hi>Iames Kennedy</hi> had obtained such Credit by his many Merits and Services to his Country, and by his good Offices towards the former King; yea, he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured such a real Opinion of his Fidelity in all Matters, by reason of the Composedness of his Manners, and his near Alliance to the King, That the rest of the Kings Guardians, which were to succeed one another, Two and Two by turns, did willingly admit and suffer him, when ever he came to Court, to be the sole Censor and Supervisor of their Pains and Diligence, in that Service. By this their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, the Kings Education was carried on very smoothly, and his own Towardliness and Ingenuity making an accession to their Industry, all Men conceiv'd great Hopes of him.</p>
               <p>Thus Matters were carried on, till about the Sixth year of the Kings Reign; There was then at Court <hi>Robert Boyd,</hi> the Chief of his Family, who, besides his Personal Estate, was ally'd to many other Great and Noble Families,<note place="margin">The <hi>Boyds</hi> c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The <hi>Boyds,</hi> upon the account of these Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, were not content with that Place and Authority, though it were very great and Honourable, which they had at Court, but fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sought to transfer all Publick Offices into their own Family; to accomplish which, <hi>Alexander</hi> was desired by them, to incline the Kings Favour towards them; He, having got the King in the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness and Ductility of his Age, did so insinuate into him by his Flattering Complaisance, that he could do all things with him. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing admitted into such private Intimacy and Converse, he would oft scatter words before the King, that he was now fit to govern, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; and that 'was time for him to be emancipated from the servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude of old <hi>Grey-Beards</hi>; and to maintain a Company of Noble <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

betimes, wherein, whether he would or no, he was likely to pass the remaining part of his Life. Discourses of this kind were easily entertain'd by a Youth, unskilful in Matters, and in the slippery Part of his Age, too; which was prone to liberty, so that he began to be a little Stubborn and Headstrong against his Governors; Some things he would do, without their advice, and Many against it, as seeking an opportunity to be delivered from the severity of those <hi>Seniors,</hi> as from a kind of Bondage and Captivity. Whereupon, being at <hi>Linlithgoe,</hi> when he went out a Hunting, unknown to <hi>Kennedy,</hi> whose turn it was <hi>then</hi> to wait, the old Man, being informed thereof, went forth to overtake him not far from the Town; and having done so, he took his Horse by the Bridle, and endeavour'd to stop and bring him back, alleging, that 'twas no convenient Time, nor was his Company fitting for such an Exercise;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Alexander Boyd</hi> abuses <hi>Kennedy.</hi>
                  </note> hereupon <hi>Alexander</hi> ran in, and with the Bow, which he had in his Hand, struck the old Man a Blow on his Head, though he deserv'd better things at his hands; <hi>Kennedy,</hi> being thus beat off, as a troublesom Hinderer of their Sport, they proceed on to the Place, they intended they go to; <hi>Kennedy,</hi> being wounded, returned into the Town. And when <hi>Robert Boyd</hi> came again to Court, he did not disapprove, what his Brother <hi>Alexander</hi> had done; By this means, the Seeds of Enmity were sown between the <hi>Two Factions,</hi> which grew up to the great Detriment of the Kingdom, and at length to the total Destruction of One of them.</p>
               <p>The Fewd was first discover'd upon This Occasion; The <hi>Boyds</hi> would have the King remov'd from that place to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> but <hi>Kennedy</hi> and his Party would have <hi>Sterlin</hi> to be the Place of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidence.

                  </note> they carry'd the King to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> there to enter upon the Regal Government. The Attendants of the Journy, were, besides their own Kindred, <hi>Adam Hepburn, Iohn Somerval,</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew Car,</hi> all Heads of their respective Families. This was acted about the 10th of <hi>Iuly</hi> in the year 1466.

               <p>Not long after, <hi>Iames Kennedy</hi> departed this Life, maturely enough for himself, if we respect his Age; but his Death was so lamented by all good Men,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iames Kenne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi>'s Death, and Character.</note> as if, in him, they had lost a publick Father. For, in that Man, besides the Virtues above- mention'd, there was an high degree of Frugality and Continence at home, yet great Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor and Magnificence abroad: He exceeded all former Bishops, yea, and all those which have sat after him in that See, to this very day, in Liberality towards the Publick; and yet notwithstanding, his own Ecclesiastical Revenues were not very great, for as yet the <hi>Scots</hi> had not arrived at that ill Custom of heaping up Steeples upon Steeples; nor had learned to spend that <hi>worse</hi> upon Luxury, which was before <hi>ill</hi> gotten by Avarice: He left one Eminent Monument of his Muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:56771:214"/>
behind him; and That was the Publick Schools at St. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews,</hi> which he built with great Expence, and endow'd with large Revenues, but issuing out of Church Incoms; he took order, that a Magnificent Monument should be erected for himself therein, which yet the Malignity of Men envy'd him for, though he had deserv'd so well privately of most Men, and publickly of all Men: They al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leg'd, 'twas a thing of too much vanity, to bestow so much Cost upon a Structure of no Use. His Death made his Virtues more illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious, and increas'd Mens desire after him; for when he, who was a perpetual Censor, and Corrector, of Manners, was once remov'd out of the way, the publick Discipline began, by degrees, to grow weak and remiss, and, at last, to be so corrupt, as to bring almost all things, with it self, to ruin.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Boyds</hi> made use of pretences in Law, to increase the Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick Power of their Family, and to abate the Potency of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and first <note n="*" place="margin">

                  <hi>Patrick Graham</hi> seem'd most pat for their purpose; he was the Brother of <hi>Iames Kennedy,</hi> by the same Mother, and was also Cousin by the Mothers-side, to <hi>Robert Boyd.</hi> He, as the Manner was in those days, was Elected Bishop by the Canons, in the Room of his Brother <hi>Iames,</hi> but was hinder'd by the Court-Faction, from having the Kings leave to go to <hi>Rome,</hi> so that he went privately to the Pope, without any Train, and so was easily admitted into his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Place; for besides the Nobleness of his Stock, and the great Recommendation of his high Virtues, he was also well Learned, as for those times. And therefore whilst he staid at <hi>Rome,</hi> fearing the Power of the Adverse Faction; The old Controversy concerning the Liberty of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> began to be revived. For the Archbishop of <hi>York</hi> pretended, That the Bishops of <hi>Scotland</hi> were under his Jurisdiction, so that he endeavour'd to retain That Power in time of Peace, which had been usurped in the Licentious Times of War. But a Decree was made at <hi>Rome,</hi> in Favour of the <hi>Scots</hi>; and <hi>Graham</hi> was not only made Primate of <hi>Scotland,</hi>

               <p>By this means, when the King was their Friend, Part of the Nobility in League with them, and also the Administration of the whole Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment put into their Hands, they thought themselves sufficiently secur'd for a long time;<note place="margin">

That Marriage, as it was opulent, and seem'd a Prop and Establishment of their Power, so it increas'd the Hatred of their Enemies; and gave Occasion to variety of Discourse, amongst the Vulgar. For, though, by this means, all passage to the King's Ear seem'd to be precluded, and they alone made the sole Arbiters of his Words and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; yet, they did not flourish so much in Favour at Court, as they were prosecuted with publick Hatred abroad; which, after Four Years Concealment, did, at last, break out to the Destruction of their whole Family; and the wiser sort of the adverse Party did not much dislike this their sudden Increase of Honour, for, they hoped, (as 'tis usual) <hi>That Arrogance would be the Companion thereof, which would not indure a Superior, and despise an Equal, yea and trample upon an Inferior; and when the Bounds of a Subjects Condition are exceeded, it also awakens Kings, who are impatient of Corrivals, to overthrow such suspected Persons.</hi> The Noise of this Discord betwixt such Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Factions, let loose the Reins to Popular Licentiousness.

               <p>When the Chancellor had inform'd the King, that all things were finish'd according to his desire, the next Consult was, to send an hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som Train of Nobles to bring over the New Queen.

And besides, there were some, who when the King was alone, did discourse him freely, concerning the Publick Calamities, and the Way to Remedy them; yea, the King himself, as if he were some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what awakned to Manly Cares, declar'd, That what was sometimes Acted abroad, did not please him.

               </p>
               <p>Their Ruin did not only amaze their Friends, but it also kept off, and damp'd, their very Enemies, so that none would adventure to Aspire to that Dignity, from whence they were cast down; partly, upon the account of the Instability of Human Affairs; and partly, in Consideration of the Kings sudden Repentance, for bestowing of his Graces and Favours, and his continu'd Perseverance in his Hatred, when once began. This is certain, that they which were erected to great Hopes of Preferment, by this change of Publick Affairs, found themselves much mistaken: For the King, who, before that time, had used himself to Domestick Ease, and seldom appear'd in Publick, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now also newly Married, spent a great part of his Time in the Pleasures of his Palace; he excluded the Nobility, and was wholly govern'd by a few of his Servants; for, being of an eager and fervid Disposition, he could not well bear the being contradicted in his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, so that he avoided the Liberty which Nobles would take, in advising him, and had only those about him, who would not repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, but rather approve of, what he did; that so by avoiding any occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Offence, by their Flattery, they might curry his Favour. Amidst these Manners of the Court, the Ecclesiastical State was not much better; for though the Ministers of the Church had been given, for many years, to Luxury and Avarice, yet there was still some shadow of ancient Gravity remaining; so that some encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement was given to Learning, and Advantage to such as were good Proficients therein. For the Bishops were chosen by the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges of Canons,<note place="margin">Bishops anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently chosen by their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats by their Monks.</note> and the Abbats by their respective Sodalities; but then the Parasite Courtiers persuaded the King, (for it was they only, who had his Heart and Ear) that it would be very gainful to him; and those with whom he was to deal, were not able to hinder his Design, if he recalled and assumed the Designation of such Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to himself, and not suffer a Matter of so great Advantage to rest in the Hands of such a dronish Generation of People, and unfit for any publick Business, as Ecclesiasticks were. The King was easily persuaded thereunto, in regard, they alleg'd, That, by this means, besides other Advantages, he might have Opportunity to curb the Contumacious, to oblige Neuters, and to reward the well deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; but, (said they) in our present Circumstances, Promotions and Honours are in the Hands of the Dregs of the Vulgar, who are as Parsimonious in case of publick Necessities, as they are profuse in their private Pleasures; but it was fit, that, in such Cases, all Men should depend upon the King alone, that so he might have the sole Power of Punishing, Pardoning, and Rewarding.</p>

For they that had bought Ecclesiastical Honours at Court, were afraid to lose both their Prey and Money too; and they, who thought to make advantage by this Court Nundination, were griev'd to be thus disappointed; yea, that Faction did no less Storm, that had obtain'd Ecclesiastical Preferments from the King, for Mercenary Gain, that so they might sell them to others. Their Fear was, that this gainful Practice would be taken out of their Hands. All these made a Conspiracy against <hi>Patrick,</hi> and in his absence, loaded him with Reproaches; they came to Court, and complain'd, that their Ancient Laws, as well as the Kings late Decrees, were Violated, and that the <hi>Romanists</hi> were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on many Matters, very prejudicial to the Kingdom; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less the King did speedily oppose their Exorbitance, they would quickly bring all things under their Power; yea, and make the King himself truckle under them.</p>
               <p>To prevent this Danger, there were some sent, by Order of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, to <hi>Patrick,</hi> before he had scarce set his Foot on Shoar, to forbid him to execute any part of his Office, until the King had heard the Complaints made against him; and a Day was appointed him to appear, the First of <hi>November</hi> at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> in order to an Hearing.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, when his Friends and Kinsfolk did assure him, that the King would do what was Equitable in so just a Cause: The adverse Faction, hearing of it, did so ingage the King and his Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, by the Promises of great Sums of Money, that <hi>Patrick</hi> could never have a Fair Hearing afterwards: When he was come to the Assembly, he produc'd the Popes Bull and Grant, wherein he was Constituted Archbishop of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> Primate of <hi>Scotland,</hi>

But he so slighted this Commination of one of an Inferiour Order to himself, that though it were Twice or Thrice serv'd upon him, yet he remitted nothing of the ordinary Course of his former Life; whereupon his Enemies (as is usual in such Cases, wherein Ecclesiastical Censures are contemn'd) implore the Assistance of the King, and cause <hi>Patrick</hi> to be shut out of all Churches. Officers of the Exchequer were sent to Inventory his Goods; his Retinue was Commanded, under an heavy Penalty, to depart; and a Guard was set upon him, to observe that he did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing contrary to the Edict. The rest of the Bishops, that they might not seem ungrateful towards so Benevolent a King, levied a great Sum of Mony, which they had violently extorted out of small Benefices, and presented him with it.

The other Good Men, being terrify'd by his Calamity, and perceiving no hopes of any Church-Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, went all about their own private Affairs; In the Court, Church-Preferments were either Sold, or else given away to Flatterers, and Panders, as a Reward for their filthy Service.</p>
               <p>Tho' these things were acted at several times, yet I have put them altogether in my Discourse, that so the Thread of my History might not be too often interrupted; and also, that by one memorable Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, we might have an entire View of the Miseries of those Times; For one may easily imagin, how vitious the ordinary sort of Men were, seeing a Man that was so Eminent for all kind of Virtue; and besides, had the Advantage to be Allyed to the King, and to many Noble Families besides, was, by a few Scoundrels of the Lowest-sort, expos'd to the Reproach and Cruelty of his Enemies. But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the other Occurrences of those Times.</p>
               <p>In the Year 1476. there was a Publick Decree made against <hi>Iohn</hi> Lord of the <hi>Islands,</hi> who had seiz'd upon some Provinces,<note place="margin">

The Provinces which he had forcibly enter'd upon, were taken from him, as <hi>Ross, Kintire, Cnapdale,</hi> but the Command of the <hi>Islands</hi> was still permitted to him. The same Year, the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie with the <hi>English,</hi> which was just about to break forth into a

The Occasion was this, <hi>Iames Kennedy</hi> had built a Ship, the biggest that ever Sailed on the Ocean, at that time; She, being at Sea, was, by a Tempest, cast upon the <hi>English</hi> Shore, and her Lading rifled by the <hi>English</hi>; Restitution was often sought for, but in vain. This bred a disgust betwixt the Nations for some Years; at last, the <hi>English</hi> sent Embassadors into <hi>Scotland</hi>; The Chief of which, were, the Bishop of <hi>Durham,</hi> and <hi>Scroop</hi> a Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; by whom <hi>Edward,</hi> having been tost by the Inconstancy of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and his Exchequer drain'd by continual Wars, desir'd a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cification, which was easily renew'd, upon Condition, That the value of the Ship rifled, and its Lading, might be estimated, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different Persons, and just Satisfaction made.</p>

                  </note>The same Year, Embassadors were sent to <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Burgun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> in behalf of the Merchants, who were disturb'd in their Trades: When they came into <hi>Flanders,</hi> they were Honourably receiv'd by him. But one <hi>Andrews</hi> a Physician, and a great Astrologer too, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing occasionally invited by them to Supper, understanding the Cause of their coming, took them aside, and told them, That they should not make too much haste in their Embassy; for, in a very few Days, they should hear other News of the Duke. And accordingly, his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction was fulfilled, for within Three Days after, his Army was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown by the <hi>Switzers,</hi>

He, (as 'tis reported) told the King, That he should speedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be Destroy'd by his own Subjects, and that Speech agreed with the Vaticinations of some wizardly Women, (to which the King was immoderately addicted) who had Prophecy'd, <hi>That a Lyon should be killed by his Whelps</hi>; Hereupon, from a Prince, at first, of great Ingenuity,<note place="margin">One <hi>Andrews</hi> an Astrologer and Physician,</note> and good Hopes, and as yet not wholly depraved; he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated into a fierce and cruel Tyrant; for when his Mind had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd, and was stuft with, Suspicions, he accounted even his nearest Kindred, and all the Best of the Nobility, as his Enemies; and the Nobles were also disgusted at him, partly, by reason of his Familiarity with that Rascally sort of People; but chiefly<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> because he slighted the Nobility, and chose mean Persons to be his Counsellors and Advisers.

They alienate the Kings mind from his Friends, and betray him to his Enemies; and thus they deprive us of our Commander, and expose us as a Prey to our Enemies Arms, by whom if your Lives are given you, after you are conquer'd, yet you will fall into Shame and Servitude; and if you overcome them, yet you will not procure Quiet to your selves, Strength to your Country, nor Glory to your King, but a greater Liberty to your Enemies, to play their Pranks at present, and that in security, for the future; and thus we shall bring a Plague and Misery on our selves, and a stricter Servitude on our King, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>After <hi>Douglas</hi> had ended his Speech, there followed, not a Debate, but a confus'd Noise, over the whole Assembly, crying out, <hi>To your Arms against the Publick Enemy</hi>; for the Minds of all present were so inflam'd, That though they had none to lead them, yet they were about to break in upon the Kings Quarters. But the graver Sort, who, by reason of their Honour and Authority had a great Interest in the rest, appeas'd the Tumult; for they fear'd, lest, in an impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous assault of the People, the King himself should come to some harm: And therefore they agreed, That the prime Commanders should take a smal number of their chiefest Confidents, and, without any general remove of the whole Army, should go the Kings Pavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, and so lay hold on the Offenders, who had the Management of things, and bring them forth to be judged before the whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, that so they might suffer condign Punishment, according to the Laws.</p>
               <p>Whilst these things were in agitation, News was brought to the Court, that the Nobles were assembled, before day, in the Church; for What, 'twas not known; but it must certainly be some great Matter, which ingag'd such Persons to assemble<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> unknown to the King and his Counsellors. The King was awakned, and rose in great fear out of his Bed, and ask'd those about him, <hi>What was best to be done?</hi>

<pb n="425" facs="tcp:56771:221"/>
him up a Prisoner to the <hi>Marshal,</hi> and then he goes directly to the Kings Bed-Chamber. They, which were there, made no Opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, either because they were astonished at his sudden Coming; or else, out of Reverence to the Man, so that there the rest were seiz'd upon, who were thought to have corrupted the King by their wicked Counsels, only one Young man hung about the Kings Neck, and he desired them to pardon him, his name was <hi>Iohn Ramsy,</hi> of a good Family; who, being excus'd, upon the account of his Age, was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist. Whilst the rest were led on to their Tryals, there was a Tumult and Noise rais'd over the whole Army, crying out, <hi>Hang them, Rogues,</hi> whereupon they were presently hurry'd away, and ended their Lives in an Halter; yea, the Army in general was so intent upon their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution, that when they wanted Ropes, upon such a sudden, they all offer'd the Reins of their Horse-Bridles and their Baggage-Horse Tackle, for that Use; and they strove much, Who should have the honour to offer his own, first.</p>
               <p>This Court-Faction had committed many Injuries against private Persons, but their Wrongs to the Publick lay chiefly here,<note place="margin">Their Crimes Objected, were,</note> They had been the Authors of Coining new Brass-Money, which the common People did call by the invidious Name of <hi>Black-Money:</hi> Upon this Project, there first ensued a Dearth of all things, and afterwards a Famine; for the Sellers had rather suffer their Commodities to be spoil'd at Home, than, under a pretence of Sale,<note place="margin">Brass-Money Coyned,</note> to give them away to the Buyers. But that all Commerce might not wholly cease amongst the People, this one Remedy was found out for Bargainers and Chapmen, That they should mention in their Contracts, in what sort of Money the Payment should be made. 'Tis true, some of our former Kings had Coin'd that kind of Money, but 'twas more for the necessary use of the Poor, than for their own Gain; and also Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion was made by a Law, beyond what Sum, Sellers might not be compell'd to take it in payment.

It was also objected against them, That they had alienated the King's Heart from the Nobility, and had set him a-gog upon <hi>Magick,</hi> and had hurried him on to the Destruction of his own Kindred.

               <p>When those Evil Counsellors were remov'd out of the way; The King had no great Confidence in the Souldiery, nor the Souldiery in him; so that the Army was dismist, and return'd Home; and the King, though, for the present, he supprest his Anger,<note place="margin">The Scots Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my disbanded.</note> and made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny large and fair Promises to the Nobility, yet his Heart inwardly boiled with Blood, Slaughter, and Revenge.

The Crimes ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:56771:223"/>
against him, were, First, That he had often sent Messengers into <hi>England,</hi> and then, that he had retir'd thither himself, without obtaining a Pass-port from the King, and that there he joined in Counsel against his Country, and his Kings Life. All the other of his Partizans were pardon'd, and amongst the rest, <hi>William Creighton,</hi> who was accus'd not only to have been an Abettor of his designs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his Country, but also the chief Author and Instigator of him, thereunto. But after he had obtain'd Pardon for what was past, he was again accus'd, that he did incourage <hi>Alexander,</hi> by his Advice and Counsel; after he was Condemned, frequent Letters passing between them, by the means of <hi>Thomas Dickson</hi> a Priest; and that he had caus'd his Castle of <hi>Creighton</hi> to be Fortified against the King, and commanded the Garison Soldiers not to surrender it up to the King's Forces.<note place="margin">

These were the Causes of his Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, mentioned in our publick Records. But, 'tis thought, that the Hatred the King had conceiv'd against him, upon a private Occasion, did him the most Mischief of all. It was this, <hi>William</hi> had a very beautiful Wife, of the Noble Family of the <hi>Dunbars</hi>; when her Husband found, that the King had had the use of her Body, he undertook a Project, which was rash enough in it self, but yet not unproper for a Mind sick of Love, and also provok'd by such an Injury, as his was; for he himself lay with the King's young Sister, a beautiful Woman, but ill spoken of for her too great Familiarity with her Brother, and on her he begot <hi>Margarite Creighton,</hi> who died not long since. In the interim, <hi>Creighton</hi>'s Wife died at his own House; and the King's Sister, whom, as I said, the King had vitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, was so much in Love with <hi>William,</hi> that she seem'd sometimes to be out of her Wits, for him. The King, partly by the Mediation of <hi>William</hi>'s Friends, and partly being mindful of the Wrong he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self had done him, of the like sort, and being willing also to cover the Infamy of his Sister, under a pretext of Marriage, permitted <hi>William</hi> to return Home again to Court, upon Condition, that he would Marry her: <hi>William</hi> was persuaded by his Friends; and, for want of better Counsel, especially since <hi>Richard</hi> of <hi>England</hi> was dead, came to <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For this cause, he sent Embassadors into <hi>Scotland,</hi> to make Peace, or, at least, a Truce for some years, there he found all things more facile than he could have hoped for. For <hi>Iames,</hi> who, for his many and notable Crimes, was grievously hated by his own People<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> as well as <hi>Richard</hi> was by His, willingly gave ear to his Ambassadors; for he hoped, That, if once he had Peace with <hi>England,</hi> that he could revenge his Wrongs at home at leisure, when <hi>England</hi> could not be a Refuge to his Opposers. For these Reasons, especially, Both Kings sent some of their Confidents to the Borders, where, after many and long Disputes concerning Compensation for Losses, seeing Peace could not be made,<note place="margin">A Truce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Richard</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and the <hi>Scots.</hi>

But <hi>Henry</hi> being troubled with many Cares, that he might cut off the Occasion of Foreign Wars, and extirpate the Seeds of old Hatred, came to <hi>Newcastle</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Tine,</hi> from thence he sent Embassadors to <hi>Scotland,</hi> either to make a perpetual League, or, at least, a long Truce with them; for he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Man of great Prudence, and having experienc'd many Vicissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of things in his Life, did judge it highly conducing to the Establishment of his Kingdom, to make Peace with his Neighbors, and especially with the <hi>Scots,</hi> because that, ordinarily, those Two Kingdoms did lye at catch for Advantages against each other, and did also nourish Rebels flying thither; yea, and entertain those which were exiled; and maintain Sedition, by giving their Authors hope of Refuge and Supply. And as for <hi>Iames,</hi> he desir'd nothing more, than to be free from the fear of Strangers, that so he might pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish his own disobedient Subjects, as he pleased. And therefore, he kindly receiv'd the Embassadors, and told them, that he desir'd no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than a Peace; but his Opinion was, that his Subjects would not yield to it, that either there should be a perpetual Peace, or any long Truce betwixt them; partly, because it was forbid by an Ancient Law, lest, when all Fear of an Enemy was removed, their Minds might languish in Idleness, and the Sinews of their Industry be remitted; and partly, because they could not so suddainly lay down that fierceness of Spirit, which they had acquir'd, by so long Use of Arms. But if they could be brought to This, to yield to a Truce for 6 or 7 Years, he would not have them refuse it. But as for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,<note place="margin">A Truce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Scots</hi> for 7 Years.</note> he was willing to maintain a firm and inviolate Peace with them, as long as he liv'd, and he would also take care, that the Truce should be renewed, before the Date of it was quite expired; but he ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly desired the Embassadors, not to divulge abroad the Discourse, which they had in secret with him, lest his Nobilitie should be more backward to a Pacification, if they saw him to be partial in the Case. When this was told <hi>Henry,</hi> who knew, in what a tumultuous Case the Affairs of <hi>Scotland</hi> were,<note place="margin">The Death of the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi>
                  </note> and how convenient it was for that King to have a Peace; imagining likewise, that he spoke really, and from his Heart, he accepted of the Truce for 7 Years, and so retir'd back to <hi>York.</hi> In the mean time, the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> dyed, a Woman of a singular Beauty and Probity too, and, by her good Graces, she was thought sometimes to have moderated the unbridled Appetites and Efforts of her Husband: <hi>Alexander</hi> also, the King's Brother, Dyed in <hi>France,</hi>

But that Edict made People to hate <hi>Ramsy</hi> more than fear him, for now, nothing but the Image of perfect Slavery was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented to their Eye. In the mean time, the King meditated no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more, than how to satisfy himself with the Blood of those Men, who were believ'd to be the Authors of Rebellion against them. And seeing he could not do it by open Force, he thought to effect it by Subtilty, and therefore he fain'd himself to be reconcil'd to This, and to the Other Man, and entertain'd them so courteously, that 'twas even below the Dignity of a Prince so to do; Others, who were eminent in Power, he gave Honors and Largesses to.

For They, that knew his Disposition, did not at all doubt, that his Simulation of Benevolence and Respect, tended to no other end, but that he might either appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the Nobility, One by One, apart; or else, might set them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Ears, one with another; which his Assembling the Chief of the Nobility at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> made more plainly to appear. For he called <hi>Douglas</hi> to him into the Castle, and told him, that he had now an Eminent Opportunity to revenge himself, for if the Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Faction were apprehended, and put to Death, the rest would be quiet; but if he omitted this Opportunity, which was so fairly put into his hands, he could never expect the like again.</p>

inflict what Punishment, you please; upon them. This Way will be more creditable, and also much more safe, than if you should set upon them secretly and by night, for then 'twould look, as if they were murder'd by Thieves. The King thought the Earl had been real in what he spake, (for he knew, that he was able to perform what he had promised) and therefore he gave him many Thanks, and more Promises of great Rewards, and so dismist him. He pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently acquainted the Nobility with their imminent Danger, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd them to withdraw themselves, as he himself also did. The King, perceiving that his secret Projects were discover'd, from that day forward would trust no Body; but after he had staid a while in the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> he sailed over into the Countries beyond the <hi>Forth,</hi> for they, as yet, remain'd firm in their Obedience to him, and there levy'd a considerable Force. And the Nobles, who, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,<note place="margin">The Nobles Arm against the King, and chuse the Kings Son for their General.</note> had sought his Amendment, not his Destruction, now seeing all Hopes of any Agreement or Concord were cut off, managed all their Counsels for his utter Overthrow and Ruin. Only there was one difficulty which troubled them, and That was, Who should be their General, that, after the King was subdued, might be Regent, or <hi>Vice-King,</hi> who might be acceptable to the People; and, on the account of the Honour of his Family, would load the Faction with as little Envy, as might be; after many Consultations in the case, at last they pitcht upon the King's Son; He was entised thereunto by the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pervisors and Tutors of his Childhood, and he did it out of this Fear, that, if he refus'd, the Government and Command would pass over to the <hi>English,</hi> the perpetual Enemies of their Family.</p>
               <p>The King, by this time, had past over the <hi>Forth,</hi> and pitcht his Tents by the Castle of <hi>Blackenes,</hi> and his Sons Army was not far off, ready for the Encounter,<note place="margin">A Temporary Agreement.</note> when, loe! the matter was compos'd by the Intervention of the Earl of <hi>Athole,</hi> the Kings Uncle; and <hi>Athole</hi> himself was given up as an Hostage for the Peace to <hi>Adam Hepburn,</hi> Earl of <hi>Bothwel,</hi> with whom he remain'd till the Kings Death; But Suspicions increasing on Both sides, the Concord lasted not long; however intercourse of Messengers passed between them, and, at last, the Nobility gave this Answer,
<q>That seeing the King did act nothing sincerely,<note place="margin">The Nobles insist on the Kings resign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Crown.</note> therefore a certain War was better than a treacherous Peace, there was but one <hi>Medium</hi> left, upon which they could agree: And that was, that the King should resign the Government, and his Son be set up in his Place; and if he would not assent to This, 'twas in vain for him to give himself the Trouble of any more Messages or Disputes.</q>
The King communicated this Answer to his Embassadors which he sent to the <hi>French</hi> and to the <hi>English,</hi> making it his Desire to them, that they would assist him against the Fury of a Few of his Rebellious Subjects,<note place="margin">The King sends <hi>Embassadors</hi> for Foreign Aid.</note> by their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; and, if need were, by some Auxiliary Forces, that so they might be reduc'd to their Obedience; for they ought to look upon it as a Common Fortune, and that the Contagion, by this Example, would quickly creep to the Neighbour-Nations: There were also Embassadors sent to <hi>Eugenius</hi> the Eighth, Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> to desire him, that, out of his Fatherly Affection to the <hi>Scotish</hi> Name, he would send a Legat into <hi>Scotland</hi> with full Power, by Ecclesiastical Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:56771:225"/>
to compel his Rebellious Subjects to lay down Arms, and obey their King. The Pope writ to <hi>Adrian</hi> of <hi>Castell,</hi> then his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat in <hi>England,</hi> a Man of great Learning and Prudence, to do his endeavour for the composing the <hi>Scotish</hi> Affair; but these Remedies were too late. For the Nobles, who were not ignorant, What the King was a doing, and knew, that he was implacable toward them, resolv'd to put it to a Battel, before any more Forces came in to him. And though they had the Kings Son with them, both to countenance their Matters with the greater Grace amongst the Vulgar, and also to shew, that they were not Enemies to their Country, but to their Misled King, only; yet, lest the Hearts of the People might be weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Approach of Foreign Ambassadors, they were solicitous, night and day, how to decide it by a Battel. But the Kings Fearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness was an hindrance to their hasty Design, who, having levied a great Strength in the Northern Parts of the Kingdom, resolved to keep himself within the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> till those Aids came to him. But he was taken off from that Counsel and Advice, though it seem'd the safest for him, by the Fraud, or, at least, the Simplicity of those about him; for, in regard of the frequent <hi>Washes</hi> and <hi>Firths,</hi> which gave delay to those who were coming in to him, they persuaded him to go to <hi>Sterlin,</hi> the only Place of the Kingdom fit to receive Aids, coming from all Parts thereof. And there he might be as safe, as he was in the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> seeing his Enemies were unprovided of all Materials, requisite for the Storming of Castles; and also he might have his Fleet, which he had rigg'd out against all hazards, to ride in some convenient Harbour, near ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining. This Counsel seem'd both faithful and also safe, if <hi>Iames Shaw,</hi> Governor of the Castle,<note place="margin">A Battel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the King and the Nobles, where the King is slain.</note> being corrupted by the contrary Faction, had not refus'd to give him entrance, so that the Enemy was almost at his Heels, and, before he knew whither to betake him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, he was forc't, with that Strength which he had, to run the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of a Fight. At the beginning, they fought stoutly, and the first Ranks of the Nobility's Army began to give ground, but the Men of <hi>Annandale</hi> and the Neighbouring Parts, inhabiting the West of <hi>Scotland,</hi> came boldly up, and having longer Spears than their Adverse Party, they presently routed the Kings Main Battel, he himself was weakned by the Fall of his Horse, and fled to some Water-Mills near the place, where the Battel was fought; his Intent was (as is suppos'd) to get to his Ships, which lay not far off; there he was taken, and a few more with him, and slain; there were Three that persued close after him in his Flight, <hi>i. e. Patrick Grey,</hi> the Head of his Family, <hi>Sterlin Car,</hi> and a Priest named <hi>Borthwick;</hi> 'tis not well known, Which of them gave him his Deaths Wound. When the News of his Death, though as yet not fully certain, was divulg'd through Both Armies, it occasion'd the Conquerors to press less violently upon those who fled away, so that there were the Fewer of them slain. For the Nobles manag'd the War against the King, not against their Fellow Subjects. There was slain of the Kings Party <hi>Alexander Cuning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> Earl of <hi>Glencarn,</hi> with some Few of his Vassals and Kindred; but there were many wounded, of Both sides. Thus <hi>Iames</hi> the Third came to his end, a Man not so much of a bad Disposition by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,

               <p>IN the Interim, an Assembly was summoned about creating a new King. There were few which came together to perform this Service, and those were mostly of the Party that had conspired against the former King. The new King, at his first entrance sent an Herauld to the Governour of <hi>Edinburgh</hi>-Castle, for him to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56771:227"/>
it, which he did, and then he passed over to <hi>Sterlin,</hi> and that Castle was also delivered up to him by the Garison-Souldiers. When the Vogue was up in <hi>England,</hi> how troublesom Matters were in <hi>Scotland,</hi> five Ships were chosen out of that King's Fleet, who entred into the <hi>Firth</hi> of <hi>Forth,</hi> and there made havock of the Goods of all Merchants, making many descents on both Shores, they migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily infesting the Maritime Parts; for they expected greater Distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances on Land, by the sidings of the <hi>Scots</hi> one against another. For seeing the adverse Party were rather shattered than broken in the late Fight, in regard they were not all there, and of those that were, there were but few slain, they thought a feircer Tempest would have arisen from Minds which yet continued to be inflamed with Hatred and Envy, and which were elevated by confidence in their own Strength. And it encreased the Indignation, that now the power over so many Noble and Eminent Persons was so easily fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len not into the King's, but to a few particular Mens Hands; for, tho the King might retain the Name and Title of a King, yet, being but a Youth of 15 Years old, he did not govern, but was himself go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by those that killed his Father: For the whole management of Matters would reside in <hi>Douglas, Hepburne,</hi> and <hi>Hume</hi>; and their Confidence was the more encreased, because all the Shores were infested with the two Fleets, the <hi>Scottish</hi> and the <hi>English.</hi> To obviate this Difficulty, first of all, the new King endeavoured to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile the Naval Forces to himself, lest when he was absent in the further parts of the Kingdom, to settle Matters there, they should make some stir, or at least should make an entrance for the <hi>English,</hi> to penetrate far into the Land, and so spoil the Mid-land Countries. Whereupon, when the old King's Death was now publickly divul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged abroad, the new One thought, that <hi>Andrew Wood</hi> would now be more flexible, and therefore he sent for him, giving him the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Faith for his Security. When he was ashoar he told him, what a great Dishonour, Loss, and publick Shame it was to the whole Nation, that a few <hi>English</hi> Ships should, in despite of them, ride under their very Noses; and thereupon he drew over <hi>Andrew</hi> to his Party,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Andrew Wood</hi> reconciled to K. <hi>Iames</hi> the 4<hi>th.</hi>

Mean while the adverse part of the Nobility, sent Messages into all parts of the Kingdom, to persuade the Countrey to rise, and not to endure the present state of Things, nor to suffer so many valiant Men to be illuded by such publick Parricides, who had murdered
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56771:227"/>
one King and held Another in Bondage; yea, who accused the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders of the King's Life, as Traitors, whereas they,<note place="margin">Some of the <hi>Scots</hi> Nobility combine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the new King's Party,</note> who were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed violaters of all divine and human Laws, gave out themselves to be the only Assertors of the Rights of their Country, and Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers of its Liberty: Amongst whom the King himself was not a Freeman, in regard he was enforced by them to take Arms against his Father, and his King too, and after he was impiously slain, then to prosecute, by a nefarious War, those who were his Father's Friends, and Defenders of his Life. Many such Discourses they spread abroad amongst the Vulgar, and, to excite a greater Flame of Indignation and Hate, <hi>Alexander Forbes,</hi> Chief of a Noble Family, carried the King's Shirt upon a Spear (all over bloody, and torn, with the Marks of the Wounds he received) through <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> and all the chief Towns of the adjacent Country; and, as if it had been by a publick Proclamation, he excited all Men, by the Voice of an Herauld, to rise in Arms to revenge so nefarious a Fact. And <hi>Matthew Stewart,</hi> Earl of <hi>Lennox,</hi> a Man of great Wealth and Power, and who by an honest kind of popularity, was equally dear to high and low, was as active in the Countries on this side the <hi>Forth</hi>; for he raised up the Earls that were his Neighbours, and with a good Force, endeavoured to pass over the Bridge at <hi>Sterlin,</hi> to join his Associates; but that Bridg being possessed by the King's Forces, he sought to pass over at a Ford, not far from the Rise of the River, at the Foot of Mount <hi>Grampias.</hi> His Design was disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to <hi>Iohn Drummond,</hi> by <hi>Alexander Mac-alpin,</hi> his Vassal, who had joined himself to the Enemy, by whom also Information was given, that all things were secure and ill-guarded in the Enemies Camp; that every one stragled up and down, as they pleased; that they had no Watch set in convenient places, nor used any Military Discipline at all: Hereupon <hi>Drummond,</hi> with some Courtiers, and a few Volunteers, who purposely came in to assist him, set upon them as they were asleep; many were killed in their sleep,<note place="margin">But are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown.</note> the rest run headlong away, without their Arms, and so returned from whence they came; many were taken Prisoners, but by their Friends that knew them, a great part of them were dismissed; they only were severely dealt with, who had either written or spoke more contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meliously than others.</p>
               <p>The Joy for this Victory was encreased by the News of another, at the same time, wherein <hi>Andrew Wood</hi> had prevailed in a Sea-fight against <hi>Stephen Bull.</hi> For <hi>Edward</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> hearing that five of his Ships were taken by two of the <hi>Scots,</hi> and those much lesser also than his, was willing to blot out the Infamy of the Thing, and yet could find out no just pretence for a War; yet he called his ablest Sea-Commanders together, he offered them what Ships, and Warlike Furniture they pleased, and so he persuaded them to revenge the Ignominy cast on the <hi>English</hi> Name, promising them great Rewards, if they could bring <hi>Wood</hi> to him, alive or dead: But when those, that knew the Valour of the Man, and his pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous Successes, made some delay in the Case, <hi>Stephen Bull,</hi> a Knight of known Courage, undertook the Expedition; and Opportunity seemed to favour his Design, because he knew that <hi>Wood</hi> was shortly
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56771:228"/>
to return out of <hi>Flanders,</hi> and he thought it would be a matter of no great difficulty to attaque him unawares in his Passage; thereupon he chose out three Ships of the Royal Navy, and equipped them well in all points, and so stood for the Isle of <hi>May,</hi> an Island uninhabited in the <note n="*" place="margin">Off the Point of <hi>Fife.</hi>
                  </note> Bay of <hi>Forth,</hi> choosing that place for the conveniency of it, because in every side of the Island there is safe riding, and Harbour for Ships; and there the Sea also grows so narrow, that no little Vessel could pass by, without being disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. Whilst he rode there, he continually kept some of his skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullest Mariners abroad in Fisher-boats, to watch, and to discover to him his Enemies Ships; he had not rode at Anchor there many days, when lo! <hi>Wood</hi>'s Ships appeared with full Sail making to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him. <hi>Bull</hi> knew them, and presently weighed Anchor, and as Victor already in his Mind, he prepared himself for the Fight: <hi>Wood</hi> staid no longer but till his Men had armed themselves, and so made up to him. Thus did these two valiant Commanders en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, as if they had had the Courage of mighty Armies, and they fought so obstinately, till the Night parted the Fray, the Victory inclining to neither side: The next Morning each of them incouraged their Party, and with renewed Strength, went to it again;<note place="margin">The manner of the Fight between <hi>Andr. Wood</hi> and the <hi>English</hi> Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.</note> they cast Iron Hooks (called Grapling Irons) into one anothers Ships, and so fought hand to hand, as if they had been at a Land Fight, and that with so great eagerness, that neither of them took notice of the falling back of the Tide, till they came to the heaps of Sand at the mouth of the River <hi>Tay</hi>; there the Water being shallower, the great Ships of the <hi>English</hi> could not be so easily managed, but were forced to a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Wood</hi>'s second Victory over the <hi>English.</hi>
                  </note> and so they were tow'd up against the Stream of the <hi>Tay</hi> to <hi>Dundee,</hi> where they staid till the dead were buried, and the wounded were distributed abroad to Chirurgeons for their Cure. This Battel was fought the 10<hi>th</hi> day of <hi>August,</hi> in the Year of our Redemption 1490.</p>
               <p>A few days after <hi>Wood</hi> went to the King, and carried with him <hi>Stephen Bull,</hi> with the other Commanders of the Ships, and the notedst of his Souldiers, which he presented to him: <hi>Wood</hi> was highly commended by the King for this Exploit, and honourably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded. The King freely dismissed the Prisoners and their Ships, and sent them back to their King with an high commendation of their Valour. For in regard they fought for Honour, not for Boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he therefore would shew, that Valour was to be honoured even in an Enemy.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Henry,</hi> tho he was much aggrieved <hi>for the loss of his Men</hi> in this unhappy Fight, yet he gave the King of <hi>Scots</hi> Thanks, and told him that he gratefully accepted his Kindness, and the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his Mind.</p>
               <p>About this time a new kind of Monster was born in <hi>Scotland</hi>; in the lower part of its Body it resembled a Male Child, not much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering from the ordinary shape of a humane Body newly born;<note place="margin">A strange Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</note> but above the Navel, the Trunk of the Body and all the other Members were double, representing both Sexes male and female. The King gave special Order for its careful education, especially in Musick,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56771:228"/>
wherein it arrived to admirable Skill; and moreover it learned seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Tongues; and sometimes the two Bodies did discover several Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites, disagreeing one with another, and so they would quarrel, one liking <hi>this,</hi> another <hi>that</hi>; and yet sometimes again they would agree and consult (as it were) in common, for the good of both: This was also memorable in it, that when the Legs and Loins were hurt <hi>below,</hi> both Bodies were sensible of the Pain in common; but when it was pricked, or otherwise hurt <hi>above,</hi> the sense of the pain did affect one Body only; which difference was also more perspicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in its Death; for one of the Bodies died many days before the other; and that which survived, being half putrified, pined away by degrees. This Monster lived twenty eight years, and then di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when <hi>Iohn</hi> was Regent of <hi>Scotland.</hi> I am the more confident in relating this Story, because there are many honest and creditable Persons yet alive, who saw this Prodigy with their Eyes.</p>
               <p>When the People of the North of <hi>Scotland</hi> heard of this Naval Victory, they gave over all thoughts of War, and return'd each to his own home. This Tumult and Broil being so easily quieted, the King applied his Mind, not only to quell all Seditions for the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,</hi> but also to prevent all occasions of them for the <hi>future</hi>; he summoned his <hi>First</hi> Parliament to be held at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi>

                  <hi>Glames,</hi> rose up, and shewed several Heads of Articles, which the <hi>Nobles</hi> had formerly sent to the King in order to a Pacification, to which <hi>Iames</hi> the third had often both assented and subscribed; and that indeed he had struck up a Peace with his Nobles upon those Terms, unless some evil Counsellors had drawn away his Mind therefrom, and so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded him to call in the old Enemy to fight against his own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. And by reason of this his Inconstancy, the Earls of <hi>Huntly, Arrol,</hi> Earl of <hi>Marshal,</hi> and <hi>Lyons</hi> himself, with many other noble Persons, had forsaken him at that time, and had set up <hi>Iames</hi> the 4<hi>th</hi> his Son, as being a great Lover of the publick Peace and Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare. After a long dispute, at last they all consented to a Decree, wherein those that were slain in the Battel of <hi>Sterlin,</hi> were affirmed to have been cut off by their own Default, and that their Slaughter was just; and that they who had took up Arms against the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the Publick, though covering their hidden Fraud under ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest pretences, were guilty of no Crime, nor consequently liable to any Punishment. All who had Votes in the Assembly, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed to this Decree, that so they might give a better account of the Fact to Foreign Embassadors, who they heard were a coming. Many other Statutes were then also made, to restore to the Poor what had been taken violently from them; to inflict light Mulcts on the Rich, and to indemnify both Parties: That their taking up of Arms at that time might never turn to the Prejudice of them or their Posterity. <note n="*" place="margin">The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of <hi>Iames</hi> the 4<hi>th.</hi>
                  </note> This Moderation of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56771:229"/>
was highly commended in a young King, of but fifteen Years old, and who was also a Conqueror, and had the Command of all; but it was further heightned by his Benignity and Faithfulness in performing his Promises; to which may be added (which the Vulgar do most admire) that he was of a graceful well-set Body, and also of a vivid and quick Apprehension; so that by his using this Victory, neither with Avarice nor Cruelty, and by his real pardoning of Offendors, in a short time there grew up a great Concord amongst both Factions, both of them equally striving to shew their Love and Duty to the King. A few only, who were most obstinate, were mulct with a small Fine, or with the loss of part of their Estates, but none at all were deprived of their whole Patrimony; neither were the Fines brought into the King's Exchequer, but expended on the Charges of the War. This his Royal Clemency was the more grateful,<note place="margin">His Clemency.</note> because Men did yet retain fresh in their Memories, upon what slight occasions in the former King's Reign, many eminent Men were outed of All; and how much inferior to them those were, who came in their places. Moreover, to engage the chief Leaders of the contrary Faction to a greater Fidelity, he joyned them in Bonds of Affinity to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; for whereas his Aunt had two Daughters, begot by several Husbands, he married <hi>Gracina Boyd</hi> to <hi>Alexander Forbes,</hi> and <hi>Margaret Hamilton</hi> to <hi>Matthew Stuart.</hi> Thus in a short time the Minds of all were reconciled, and a pleasant Peace and Tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity did ensue; yea, as if Fortune had submitted her self to be an Handmaid to the King's Virtues, there was so great an encrease of Grain and Fruits of the Earth, as if a <hi>Golden</hi> Spring had suddenly started up, out of a more than <hi>Iron Age.</hi> Thus, after the King had suppressed Robberies by Arms,<note place="margin">His sorrowful Resentment for his Fathers Death.</note> and other Vices by the Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Laws; lest he might seem a sharp Avenger of others, but indulgent to himself; and withal, to make it appear, that his Father was slain against his Will, he wore an Iron Chain about his Waste as long as he lived, and every Year he added one Link thereunto; and tho this Practice might seem formidable to those that were the Causers of his Father's Death; yet they had such Confidence, either in the Gentleness of the King's Disposition, or in their own Power, that it occasioned no Insurrection at all.</p>

                  <hi>Nervii,</hi> but of such Beauty, Ingenuity, Stature of Body, and Manliness of Countenance, that he might easily be believed to have been descended of a Royal Stock. And by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of his Poverty, he had travelled up and down in several
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56771:229"/>
Countries, (so that he was known but by very few of his own Relations) and there he had learned several Languages, and had hardened himself to all kind of bold and impudent Carriage; when <hi>Margarite</hi> (who was intent on all occasions to disturb the Peace of <hi>England</hi>) had got this Youth, she kept him a while pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately by her, till she had informed him with what Factions <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> laboured at that time, what Friends and what Enemies she had there; in a word, she made him acquainted with the whole Genealogy of the Royal Progeny, and what Happinesses or Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes had attended each of them. When things seemed thus to be somewhat ripe, she was resolved to try Fortune, and took private order, that he should be sent, in a decent Equipage, <hi>first</hi> into <hi>Portugal, then</hi> into <hi>Ireland</hi>; there he had a great Concourse of People flock'd about him, and was received with huge Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause, as the Son of King <hi>Edward</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> either because his own Disposition, assisted also by Art, was inclined to Dissimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; or because being there amongst wild <hi>Kerns,</hi> he was soon likely to raise great Stirs and Tumults. When a War brake forth suddenly betwixt the <hi>French</hi> and the <hi>English,</hi> he was called for out of <hi>Ireland</hi> by <hi>Charles</hi> the Eighth, and had great Promises made him; so that coming to <hi>Paris,</hi> he was there honourably received in the Garb and Equipage of a <hi>Prince,</hi> and had a Guard appointed him; yea, the <hi>English</hi> Exiles, who were numerous at that Court, put him in a sure hope of the Kingdom. But that Tumult being quieted, upon Terms, he departed privately out of the Court of <hi>France,</hi> for fear lest he should have been delivered up, and so retired to <hi>Flanders,</hi> there he was highly caressed by <hi>Margaret,</hi> as if it were the first time that ever she had seen him,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Warbeck</hi> set up by <hi>Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret</hi> Dutchess of <hi>Burgundy.</hi>
                  </note> and was diligently shewed to all the Courtiers, and several times in the hearing of many of them, he was desired to relate the Story of all his Adventures. <hi>Margarite,</hi> as if this were the first time she had ever heard it, did so accommodate her dissembled Affections in compliance with each part of his Discourse, both when he related his Successes and also his Misfortunes, that every body thought, she believed what he had spoken to be certainly true.</p>
               <p>After a day or two, <hi>Peter</hi> was desired to go abroad in the habit of a Prince, and had thirty Men to be his Guard, wearing a <hi>white Rose,</hi> (which is the Badg of the <hi>York</hi>-Faction amongst the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>) and so was every where declared as the undoubted Heir of the Crown of <hi>England.</hi> When these things were divulged, first in <hi>Flanders,</hi> afterward in <hi>England,</hi> the Minds of Men were so stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up, that a great concourse of People flock'd in to him, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of those who lurked in Holes and Sanctuaries for fear of the Laws, but even of some Noble-men, whom their present State did not please, or who desired Innovations. But when a longer delay, which <hi>Peter</hi> hoped would bring in more Force to him, was likely to abate his present Strength, if he were discovered to be a Counterfeit, therefore he determined to try his Fortune in a Fight; so that, having gotten a pretty great Party together, he landed some few of them in <hi>Kent,</hi> to try the Affections of the <hi>Kentish</hi>-men, but in vain.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56771:230"/>
All those, who landed, were taken, so that he was forced to steer his course for <hi>Ireland</hi>; and there also he met not with the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he hoped for; so that he sailed over into <hi>Scotland,</hi> well knowing, that Peace betwixt <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>England</hi> never used to continue very long. He being admitted into the King's Presence, made a lamentable complaint of the Ruin of the <hi>York</hi>-Family, and what miserable Calamities he himself had suffered; and therefore he earnestly besought him, to vindicate Royal Blood from such contumely and shame. The King bid him be of good chear, and promised he should shortly find, That he had not desired his help, in his Distresses, in vain. A few days after a Council was called, where <hi>Peter</hi> made a sad Story of his Misfortunes, That he being born of a King, the most Flourishing of his Time, and that of the highest hopes too, was left destitute, by the untimely death of his Father,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Warbeck</hi>'s feigned Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</note> and so was like to have fallen into the Tyrannical Hands of his Uncle <hi>Richard,</hi> before he was sensible almost what Misery was. That his Elder Brother was cruelly murdered by him, but that he himself was stolen away by his Father's Friends, so that now he durst not live, no not a poor and precarious Life, even in that Kingdom of which he was the lawful Heir. That he had so miserably lived amongst Foreign Nations, that he preferred the Condition of his deceased Brother before his own, in regard he was snatch'd away from all further Calamity by a suddain and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Death: That he himself was reserved, as the ridicule of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and that his Sorrow had not that alleviation, that he durst bewail his miserable State amongst Strangers, to incline them to pity him; for after he had begun openly to profess what he was, Fortune had assaulted him with all her Darts; and, to his former Miseries, had added a daily fear of Treachery, for his crafty Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my had sometimes tampered with those who entertained him, to take away his Life; and sometimes he had privily suborned his Subjects, under the name of Friends, to discover his secret Designs, to corrupt his <hi>true</hi> Friends, and to find out his <hi>secret</hi> ones, and to calumniate his Stock and Pedigree, by false Accusations amongst the Vulgar; to reproach his Aunt <hi>Margaret,</hi> and those English Nobles that owned him; and yet notwithstanding, that she, being supported by a good Conscience against the revilings of Enemies, and also out of compassion to her own Blood, had supported him in his low Estate with her Assistance. But at last, when he percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that he could not have Aid enough from her to recover his Kingdom, (being a Widow, and old too) he had solicited Neighbour-Kings and Nations, desiring them to respect the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Chances of Man's Life, and not to suffer Royal Blood to be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed by Tyrannical Violence, and so himself to pine away with Grief, Fear, and Misery; and that he, though so the present, afflicted with great Evils, yet was not so dejected in his Mind, but that he hoped the time would come, that being restored to his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom by the Aid of his Friends, (of whom he had many both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi>) he should be able to consider every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Man's Service, and reward him accordingly; especially if the <hi>Scots</hi> would join their Forces with His, and if ever he was restored
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56771:230"/>
to his Kingdom by their Arms, they should soon understand, that they had won a fast Friend, and that at such a time too, when the trial of true Friendship is wont to be made; for he and his Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity would be so gratefully mindful of the Obligation, that they would ever acknowledg, that the accession of his better Fortune was due to them alone. Besides, he added many things in praise of the King, part of them true, and part accommodated to their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Condition.</p>
               <p>Having thus said, he held his Peace: but the King called him up to him, and bid him, Take Heart, for he would refer his Demands to the Council, whose Advice, in Grand Affairs, he must needs have; yet, however they did determine, he promised him faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, That he should not repent that he made His Court his Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary. Upon this <hi>Peter</hi> quitted the Assembly, and the Matter being put to a debate, the wiser sort,<note place="margin">The <hi>Scots</hi> Council cajol'd by <hi>Warbeck.</hi>
                  </note> who had most experience in State-Affairs, thought it best to reject the whole Business, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they judg'd he was a Counterfeit, or else, that they foresaw there would be more Danger by the War, than Advantage by the Victory, tho' they were sure of it. But the major part, either through unskilfulness in Affairs, or inconstancy of Spirit, or else to gratify the King, argued that <hi>Peter</hi>'s Cause was most just, and that they greatly pittied the Man: they added also, That now Matters were in some confusion in <hi>England,</hi> and Mens Minds were yet fluctuating, after the Civil War, and therefore it was good to lay hold of this Opportunity; and that which the <hi>English</hi> were wont to do to them, they themselves ought to try for once, to make use of the Enemies Distractions for their own Advantage; yea, they foretold a Victory, preconceived in their Minds, before they had put on their Armour; especially, if great Forces of the <hi>English</hi> came in to join them; nay, if they should not come in in such Numbers as they hoped, yet one of these two things must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily follow, That either they should conquer <hi>Henry,</hi> and so settle this new King on his Throne; who, in recompence for so great a Benefit, must needs grant them all that they desired: Or, if they could end the Matter without Blows, yet <hi>Henry,</hi> upon the quelling Domestick Tumults, not being yet fully settled in his Throne, would submit to what Conditions they pleased: But if he refused so to do, when War was once begun, many advantages might offer themselves, which now were unforeseen.</p>
               <p>This was the Opinion of the major part, and the King himself in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to them, and his Vote drew in the rest. And after this, he treated <hi>Peter</hi> more honourably than before, gave him the Title of Duke of <hi>York</hi>; and, as such, shewed him to the People.<note place="margin">K. <hi>Iames</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries <hi>Katherine Gordon,</hi> his Kinswoman, to <hi>Warbeck,</hi> and assists him with an Army a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>England.</hi>
                  </note> And not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented herewith, he gave him <hi>Katharine Gordon,</hi> Daughter to the Earl of <hi>Huntly,</hi> to Wife, a Woman of as great Beauty as Nobility of Stock, by this Affinity erecting him to hopes of thriving, and bettering his Condition. And therefore by Advice of his Council, he levied an Army, and marched for <hi>England</hi>; first of all carrying it warily, and having his Troops ready to engage, if any suddain As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault should be made upon him. But afterwards, when he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood by his Spies, that the Enemy had no Army in the Field, he
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56771:231"/>
sent out Parties to Plunder, and in a short time wasted almost all <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and the Countries thereabout. He staid some days in those Parts, and not an <hi>English</hi>-Man stirred, in behalf of <hi>Peter:</hi> And it being told him, that an Army was levying against him in the adjacent Counties, he thought it dangerous to venture his Souldiers, who were loaden with Booty, against the new and fresh Forces of the <hi>English,</hi> and therefore he resolved to return into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and there to leave their Booty; and as soon as the time of the Year would permit, to undertake a new Expedition. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did he fear that the <hi>English</hi> would follow him in his retreat, for he knew that new-raised Souldiers would not be long kept together, neither would they make after him, if they could, through a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try so lately harassed and desolated by the Wars; especially, having no Provisions prepared before-hand. And besides, <hi>Peter</hi> was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid, that in regard none of the <hi>English</hi> came in to him, as he hoped, that if he staid any longer in his Enemies Country, his Cheat would be discovered, so that he himself seemed to approve of the King's Resolution, came cunningly to him, and composing his Speech and Countenance so, as might best move Compassion, he humbly besought him, That he would not make such Havock in a Kingdom that was his own by Right; and that he would not so cruelly shed so much Blood of his Subjects, for no Kingdom in the World was of so much worth to him, as for its sake to have his Peoples Blood so largely spilt, and his Country so wasted with Fire and Sword, to procure it. The King began now to smell out and understand,<note place="margin">K. <hi>Iames</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to smell out <hi>Warbeck</hi>'s Cheat.</note> whither this unseasonable Clemency did tend, and therefore told him, That he feared he would preserve that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, in which not a Man did own him as a Subject, much less as a King, not for himself, but for his Capital Enemy; and so by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon consent they returned Home, and the Army was disbanded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Henry</hi> being made acquainted with the Invasion, and also the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat of the <hi>Scots,</hi> appointed an Expedition against them the Year after, and in the mean time levied a great Army; and that he might not be idle in the Winter-time, he summons a Parliament, who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of his Design to make War on <hi>Scotland,</hi> and granted a small Subsidy upon the People for that end.<note place="margin">

These were the publick Complaints of all the Commons: but the <hi>Cornish</hi> were more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged than all the rest, for they, inhabiting a Country which is in great part barren, are wont rather to gain than lose by Wars: And therefore, that warlike People, having been accustomed rather to encrease their Estates by Military Spoils, than to lessen them by pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56771:231"/>
Taxes and Rates, first of all rose against the King's Officers and Collectors, and slew them; and then, being conscious that they had engaged themselves in so bold an Attempt, that there was no retreat, nor hopes of Mercy, the Multitude flocking in daily more and more to them with Arms in their hands, they began their march towards <hi>London.</hi> But 'tis not my Business to prosecute the Story of this Insurrection, it is enough for my purpose to tell you, that the King was so busied this whole Year by the <hi>Cornish,</hi> that the Army which he had designed against <hi>Scotland,</hi> he was enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to employ against them.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, <hi>Iames,</hi> foreseeing, That <hi>Henry</hi> would not let the Injuries of the former Year pass unrevenged, and being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so informed by his Intelligencers, That he was raising great For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces against him, He, on the other side, levied an Army, to the intent, That if the <hi>English</hi> invaded him first,<note place="margin">K. <hi>Iames</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vades <hi>England,</hi> but to little purpose.</note> he might be in a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture to defend himself; if not, then he himself would make an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>road into his Enemies Country, and there so waste and destroy the bordering Counties, that the Soil (poor enough of it self) should not afford sufficient Necessaries, even for the very Husbandman. And hearing of the <hi>Cornish</hi> Insurrection, he presently began his march, and entered <hi>England</hi> with a great Army, dividing his Forces into two parts; one went towards <hi>Durham</hi> to ravage that Country, and with the rest he besieged <hi>Norham,</hi> a strong Castle scituated on a very high Hill, by the River <hi>Tweed.</hi> But neither <hi>here</hi> nor <hi>there</hi> was there any thing considerable done: For <hi>Richard Fox,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Durham,</hi> a very prudent Person, foreseeing, that the <hi>Scots</hi> would not omit the Opportunity of attempting some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what during the civil Broils in <hi>England,</hi> had fortified some Castles with strong Garisons, and had taken care that the Cattle, and all other driveable and portable things should be conveyed unto places, either safe by Nature, or made so by the vicinity of Moors &amp; Rivers. And moreover he sent for the Earl of <hi>Surry,</hi> who had great Forces in <hi>Yorkshire,</hi> to assist him; and therefore the <hi>Scots</hi> only burnt the Country, and not being able to take <hi>Norham,</hi> which was stoutly defended by those within, raised the Siege, and without any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Action returned Home. The <hi>English</hi> followed them not long after, and demolished <note n="*" place="margin">In the <hi>Mers</hi> on the River <hi>Aye,</hi> a mile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove <hi>Aymouth.</hi>

                  <hi>Aytown,</hi> a small Castle, seated almost in the very Borders, and he returned out of their Enemies Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, without any memorable performance also.</p>
               <p>Amidst these Commotions, both foreign and domestick, <hi>Peter Hialas,</hi> a Man of great Wisdom, and, as those Times were, not unlearned, arrived in <hi>England</hi>; he was sent by <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Isabel,</hi> King and Queen of <hi>Spain.</hi> The purport of his Embassy was,<note place="margin">An Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor form <hi>Spain</hi> to <hi>England.</hi>
                  </note> That <hi>Katharine,</hi> their Daughter, might marry <hi>Arthur</hi> King <hi>Henry</hi>'s Son, and so a new Affinity and Friendship might be contracted betwixt them. The <hi>English</hi> did willingly embrace the Affinity, and therefore were desirous to finish the War with <hi>Scotland</hi>; and because <hi>Henry</hi> thought it was below his Dignity to seek Peace at the <hi>Scots</hi> Hands, he was willing to use him as a Mediator.<note place="margin">Who mediates a Peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>England.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Peter</hi> willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly undertook the Business, and came into <hi>Scotland</hi>; there he plied <hi>Iames</hi> with several Arguments, and at last made him inclinable
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56771:232"/>
to a Peace; and then he wrote to <hi>Henry,</hi> That he hoped a good Peace would be agreed without any great difficulty, if he pleased to send down some Eminent Person of his Council, to accord the Conditions. <hi>Henry,</hi> as one that had often tried the inconstancy of Fortune, and that the Minds of his Subjects were grown fierce by these late Tumults, as being rather irritated than wholly suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, commanded <hi>Richard Fox,</hi> who resided in his Castle at <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> to join Counsels with <hi>Hialas.</hi> These Two had many Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputes about the Matter with the Embassadors of <hi>Scotland,</hi> at <note n="*" place="margin">The chief Town in <hi>Tivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale,</hi> standing on the West of the River <hi>Ied.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Ied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> and after many Conditions had been mutually proposed, they could agree upon nothing. The chiefest Impediment was, The demand of <hi>Henry,</hi> that <hi>Peter Warbeck</hi> should be given up to him, for he judged it to be a very reasonable Proposition, in regard he was but a Counterfeit, and had been already the Occasion of so much Mischief. <hi>Iames</hi> peremptorily refused so to do, alledging, That it was not honourable in him to surrender up a Man of the Royal Progeny, who came to him as a Suppliant; whom he had also made his Kinsman by Marriage, against his Faith gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to him, to be made a Laughing-stock by his Enemies. And thus the Conference broke off; yet the hopes of an Agreement were not altogether cast off, for a Truce was made for some months, till <hi>Iames</hi> could dismiss <hi>Warbeck,</hi> upon Honourable Terms, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Promise.</p>
               <p>For now, by the Conference with the <hi>English,</hi> and other evident Indications, it plainly appeared, that the Tale concerning <hi>Peter</hi>'s State and Kindred was a mere Falsity, and therefore the King sent for him, and told him, what singular good Will he had born him, and how many Courtesies he had bestowed upon him, of which he himself was the best Witness; as <hi>first, That</hi> he had undertaken a War against a Potent King for his sake; and had now managed it a second Year, to the great Inconvenience of his Enemy, and the Prejudice of his own Subjects. <hi>That</hi> he had refused an Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Peace, which was freely offered him, merely because he would not surrender him up to the <hi>English</hi>; and thereby he had given great Offence, both to his Subjects and his Enemy too; so that now, he neither could, nor would, any longer withstand their Desires. And therefore, whatever might ensue, whether Peace or War, he desired him to seek out some other and fitter Place for his Banishment, for he was resolved to make Peace with the <hi>English</hi>; and when it was once solemnly made, to observe it as religiously; and to remove from him whatsoever might be an Impediment or Disturbance thereto: Neither ought he to complain, That the <hi>Scots</hi> had forsaken him, seeing the <hi>English</hi> had done so <hi>first,</hi> in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of whose Assistance the <hi>Scots</hi> had begun the War: And yet, notwithstanding all these Circumstances, he was resolved to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate him with Provisions, and other Necessaries, to put to Sea.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Warbeck</hi> was mightily troubled at his unexpected dismission; yet he remitted nothing of his dissimulated height of Spirit, but in a few days,<note place="margin">

               <p>The Seminary of War between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most extinguished, and a great likelihood of Peace appearing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, there arose a great Ebullition of Spirit, upon a very light occasion, which had almost broken out into a fierce War. Some <hi>Scottish</hi> Youths went over to the Town of <hi>Norham,</hi> which was near to the Castle, (as they were oft wont to do in Times of Peace) there to recreate themselves in Sports and Pastimes, and to junket together with their Neighbours, as if they had been at Home, for there was but a small River, which divided them.<note place="margin">A War like to arise on a small Occasion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>England</hi> &amp; <hi>Scotland</hi>; but accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Fox</hi> Bp. of <hi>Durham.</hi>
                  </note> The Garison in the Castle, out of the Rancour, yet lodging in their Breasts since the former War, and being also provoked by some passionate words, accused those <hi>Scots,</hi> as Spies, and so from Words they came to Blows; many were wounded on both sides, and the <hi>Scots</hi> being fewer in number, were forced to return Home with the loss of some of their Company. This Business was often canvassed in the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, between the <hi>Lords</hi> of the <hi>Marches</hi>; and at last <hi>Iames</hi> was very angry, and sent an Herald to <hi>Henry,</hi> to complain of Breach of Truce, and how unconstant the <hi>English</hi> were in keeping Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; and unless Satisfaction were given, according to the just Laws, which were made by general Consent, about restitution betwixt the Borderers, he commanded him to denounce War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him. <hi>Henry</hi> had been exercised by the Violence of Fortune, even from his Cradle, and therefore was more inclined to Peace: his Answer was, That whatever was done of that kind, was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his Will, and without his Knowledg; and if the Garison-Souldiers had offended in the Case, by their Temerity, he would take order, That Examination should be made, and that, the Leagues being kept inviolate, the Guilty should be punished. But this was slowly done, and <hi>Iames</hi> looked upon the Answer, as dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, that so Punishment might be deferred, and the Sentiment thereof worn out with Time; and therefore it rather provoked than satisfied <hi>Iames.</hi> But <hi>Richard Fox,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Durham,</hi> who was owner of the Castle, being much troubled, that an occasion of breaking the League should be administred by any of <hi>his</hi> Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants; to prevent it, sent several Letters to <hi>Iames,</hi> full of great submission, modesty, and civility, which so inclined the Mind of <hi>Iames,</hi> that he wrote him word back, that he would willingly speak with him, not only about the late Wrongs done, but also about other Matters which might be advantagious to both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms. <hi>Fox</hi> acquainted his King herewith, and, by his Consent, he waited upon <hi>Iames</hi> at <note n="*" place="margin">

                  </note> he hoped that the thing would be for the benefit of both Kingdoms; and if <hi>Fox,</hi> whose Authority he knew to be great at home, would but do his Endeavour to accomplish the Affinity, he did not doubt but it would be soon effected.

               <p>After the Marriage all things were quiet, and the Court turned from the Study of Arms to Sports and Pastimes, so that there was nothing but Masks, Shews, Feastings, Dancings, and Balls; it was as a continued Jubilee, and, upon that account, every day was as an <hi>Holy-day:</hi> There were also Horse-Tiltings, frequently made, mostly according to the <hi>French</hi> Mode, betwixt which (as Tragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Acts) there intervened the Challenges of Moss-Troopers one of another, who were wont to live upon Spoil; which Sport the King was well pleased to behold, because he judged that the killing of them was a Gain to him.

Neither did he rest in these ludicrous Exercises, but he laid out a great deal of Mony upon Building, at <hi>Sterlin, Falkland,</hi> and sundry other places, and especially in building of Monasteries; but his Cost about Ships was greatest of all, for he built three stately ones of a great Bulk, and many also of a middle Rate; one of his great ones was to admiration, the biggest that ever any Man had seen sail on the Ocean,<note place="margin">A vast Ship built by King <hi>Iames.</hi>

This Law was introduced by Court-Parasites, to advance the King's Exchequer: but being looked upon as unjust, had lain dormant a long time; but the King, being informed that Money might be got out of the Violators of it, commanded it to be put in Execution: that <hi>Process,</hi> they call <hi>Recognition.</hi>

He had rigged a Navy for this Voyage, and had nominated the chief of his Retinue; and had acquainted his Neighbour-Kings, by his Ambassadours, of his Intent; and many of his Followers, as if they had obliged themselves by the same Vow, suffered the Hairs of their Heads and Beards to grow at length; and, it was thought he would immediately have taken Ship, if some Hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances had not intervened, even whilst he was most intent on his Journey: For, at that time,<note place="margin">The execution of it preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and how.</note> there arose a vehement Suspicion of a War like to ensue betwixt <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> for <hi>Henry</hi> did not like the Successes of the <hi>French</hi> in <hi>Italy</hi>; and, besides, he was soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited by <hi>Iulius</hi> the 2<hi>d,</hi> then Pope, and by <hi>Ferdinand</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> his Father-in-Law, to join with them; and with the <hi>Venetians, Swiss,</hi> and <hi>Maximilian</hi> too (tho he did regulate his Councils ordinarily according to Events): for it was likely, that the Conjunctions

of so many Nations against <hi>France,</hi> would almost swallow it up.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>England,</hi> being in the prime of his Age, and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated much in the sense of the Power of his Kingdoms, and also being very willing to be in Action, was desirous to enter into this Confederacy, but wanted a fair Pretence to fall out with <hi>France.</hi> But both of them knew one anothers Designs, by their Spies, and when <hi>France</hi> could not be persuaded to desist from warring against the <hi>Pope,</hi> who was <hi>Henry</hi>'s Friend, at length an Herauld was sent into <hi>France,</hi> to demand <hi>Normandy, Aquitain,</hi> and <hi>Anjou,</hi> (as the old Possessions of the <hi>English</hi>) in <hi>France.</hi> But in regard <hi>France</hi> was not moved by these Threats neither, to intermit the War in <hi>Italy,</hi> hereupon <hi>Henry</hi> denounced War against him, and sent an Army in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <p>On the North-west of <hi>Spain,</hi> in the <hi>Cantabrian</hi> Ocean.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Now <hi>Iames</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> tho he resolved to side with neither of them, yet, as more inclinable to the <hi>French,</hi> he sent his Navy afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, as a Present to <hi>Ann</hi> Queen of <hi>France,</hi> that so it might seem rather as a mark of his Friendship, than any real Assistance, for Military Action. And moreover, the <hi>Scots</hi> Clergy, who were used to <hi>French</hi> Largesses, were willing to shew themselves in behalf of <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>France</hi>; and seeing they durst not openly do it, they sought out occasions to alienate the King's Mind from the <hi>English.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In order hereto, <hi>Andrew Forman,</hi> then Bishop of <hi>Murray,</hi> one of their Faction,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Andrew Forman</hi> sent into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> by <hi>Iames</hi> to pick a Quarrel.</note> and a Friend to <hi>Lewis,</hi> was sent into <hi>England</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand a vast Sum of Gold and Silver, the greatest part thereof con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted in Womens Jewels and Ornaments, which were reported to be given, by Will, by <hi>Arthur, Henry</hi> the 8<hi>ths</hi> Elder Brother, to his Sister <hi>Margaret,</hi> now married to <hi>Iames,</hi> as I related before. <hi>Henry</hi> (as 'tis probable) looked upon this Demand only as a Pretence for a Quarrel, and therefore he answered <hi>Iames</hi> very mildly; That if any thing were due to him, he would not only pay it; but if he wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a greater Sum, or any other Assistance, he would not fail to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply him. When <hi>Iames</hi> received this Answer, he resolved to assist <hi>Lewis</hi> in any other way,<note place="margin">And from thence into <hi>France.</hi>
                  </note> but by no means to invade <hi>England</hi>; and he sent over the same <hi>Forman</hi> into <hi>France,</hi> to acquaint <hi>Lewis</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. Meanwhile, because he had heard that great Naval Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations were making on both sides, he resolved to send the Fleet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forementioned to <hi>Ann</hi> immediately, that so it might arrive there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the War did actually break forth; he made <hi>Iames Hamilton,</hi> Earl of <hi>Arran,</hi> Admiral of it, and caused him to set sail with the first Opportunity. But <hi>Hamilton,</hi> tho a Man good enough, yet was more skilled in the Arts of Peace than War,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hamilton</hi> sent with a Fleet to <hi>France,</hi> but turns to <hi>Knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fergus</hi> in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                  </note> and therefore ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of fear of Danger, or else out of his habitual backward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, left his Voyage for <hi>France,</hi> and turned to <hi>Knockfergus,</hi> a Town in <hi>Ireland,</hi> scituate over against <hi>Galway</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> which place he pillaged and burnt; and afterward, as if he had been a mighty Conqueror, he hoisted sail for <hi>Air</hi> (in <hi>Scotland</hi>) a Port-Town in <hi>Kyle.</hi> When the King heard of his Return, he was very outragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous against him, and could not forbear to express his menacing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches against the Man; and he was the more inraged against
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56771:234"/>
him, because he had received a Letter from Queen <hi>Ann</hi> out of <hi>France,</hi> which did endeavour to flatter him into a War against <hi>England</hi>; and he had also other Letters from <hi>Andrew Forman,</hi> which inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, That he was generally upbraided with the Promise of send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Fleet, which they now looked upon as vain, in regard no such thing was done. The King was willing to obviate this mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief as well as he could, and therefore seeing <hi>Hamilton</hi> had broke off the Course, he was commanded to run, and had destroyed a Town, that had never been an Enemy to the <hi>Scots,</hi> and was then also in Alliance with them, and so had made War upon his Friends, without denouncing it beforehand, therefore he cashiered him the Admiralship, and caused him to be summoned to appear before him. <hi>Archibald Douglas</hi> Earl of <hi>Angus</hi> was designed to succeed him in that Command, and <hi>Andrew Wood</hi> was sent with him to take the Fleet into his Charge. But <hi>Hamilton</hi> had notice, by his Friends before their coming, of the King's Displeasure against him, and therefore presently hoised Sail, resolving rather to commit himself to the wide Sea, than to an enraged King;<note place="margin">

                  </note> he was a long time sail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for <hi>France,</hi> his Ship being tossed with contrary Winds and sore Storms in the Way, so that he arrived not there till the <hi>French</hi> had laid aside the Thoughts of any Naval Preparations, and then he landed in <note n="*" place="margin">Little Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain lying in the Chanel on the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>west of <hi>France.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>In the interim, other causes of Discord arose at Home, which wholly alienated <hi>Iames</hi> from <hi>Henry.</hi> In the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the 7<hi>th,</hi> there was one <hi>Robert Carr,</hi> a worthy Knight, so much beloved of <hi>Iames,</hi> for his excellent Virtues, that he made him his chief Cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearer, Master of his Ordnance, and Lord-Warden of the middle-Borders or Marches. He was a severe punisher of all Robbers, which procured him great Favour with the King,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Robert Car</hi> se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere against Moss-Troop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</note> but increased the Hatred of the Borderers against him. So that both <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Scots,</hi> whose Licentiousness he restrained, by putting the Laws in Execution against them, jointly sought all occasions to take away his Life; and, at length, at a solemn meeting of <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>English,</hi> which used to be kept, to adjust and recompense Damages received, a Quarrel arose, and three <hi>English-men,</hi> bold Fellows, <hi>Iohn Hern, Lilburn,</hi> and one <hi>Starhed,</hi> set upon him, one came behind and ran him through his Back with a Lance, and, when he was wounded, the other two dispatched him quite. This Business was likely to create a War; but <hi>Henry,</hi> as he was just in other Things,<note place="margin">He is slain.</note> so in this was as angry as <hi>Iames</hi> at the foulness of the Fact, and therefore he caused <hi>Iohn Hern,</hi> the Brother of th'other <hi>Iohn,</hi> Lord of <note n="â€ " place="margin">Standing on a Rock above the <hi>Firth</hi> of <hi>Forth.</hi>

And for the expiation of so manifest a Crime, it was decreed, That in future Assemblings of that kind, the <hi>English</hi> should first crave the publick Faith for their Security, and so enter <hi>Scotland,</hi> and have their Meetings there; and the Ambassadors of <hi>England,</hi> by many solemn Protestations and Ceremony of Words, should declare,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:56771:235"/>
That the Publick was not concerned, as guilty of that particular Murder. The other two Murderers lurked in the inland Parts of <hi>England,</hi> till the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the 8<hi>th</hi>; and yet they went not unpunished, for when they had got a Young King, fierce, potent, and saw, that he was willing to shew the greatness of his Strength, they crept out of their Dens. <hi>Hern,</hi> by the mediation of his Kindred, lived openly at his own House, and privately sent in Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to <hi>Scotland,</hi> to disturb the Publick Peace, hoping, that if a War were once begun, he should obtain Indemnity for his <hi>old</hi> Offences, and Impunity even with freedom to commit <hi>new.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of <hi>Robert Carr</hi> escape not unpunish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> But <hi>Starhed</hi> got a Place to live in, about 90 Miles from the Borders, thinking to be safe by reason of the remoteness of his Habitation; but <hi>Andrew Carr,</hi> the Son of <hi>Robert,</hi> who saw, that the Seeds of Hatred, which would soon break out into a War, were then sown, and fearing that if once they entred into Arms, he should lose the avengement of his Father's Blood, persuades two of his Tenants, of the Family of the <hi>Tates,</hi> to disguise themselves, and to kill <hi>Starhed.</hi> They undertook to do it, and so entred his House securely in the Night; for living so far from the Borders, he thought he needed no Watch; where they killed him, cut off his Head, and brought it to <hi>Andrew</hi>; he, in testimony of his desired Revenge, sends it to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and sets it up there upon an high and conspicuous Place. Of <hi>Hern</hi> I shall speak in due time.</p>
               <p>A new Fact trod on the Heels of this old Injury, which awakened the Anger of the King of <hi>Scots,</hi> that was rather asleep than ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished, before. At that time, there was one <hi>Andrew Breton,</hi> a <hi>Scots</hi> Merchant, his Father had a Ship rifled by the <hi>Portugals,</hi> and himself cruelly slain: <hi>Andrew</hi> had the Cause heard in <hi>Flanders,</hi> (because there the Murder was committed) where the <hi>Portugals</hi> were cast;<note place="margin">The Story of <hi>Andrew Breton.</hi>
                  </note> but they, not paying what was adjudged, neither did their King, tho' <hi>Iames</hi> sent an Herald to him for that end, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel them so to do. <hi>Andrew</hi> hereupon obtained Letters of Mart from <hi>Iames,</hi> to satisfy himself for the Damages and Murder; and it was directed to all Princes and Cities lying near the Sea, That they should not account him as a Pirate, or Robber, if, by open Force, he revenged himself on the <hi>Portugals,</hi> who were such Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters of common Right and Equity: so that in a few Months he did much mischief to the <hi>Portugals.</hi> Their Ambassadors, in the height of the War the <hi>French</hi> made against Pope <hi>Iulius</hi> the Second, and which was soon like to break out against the <hi>English,</hi> as siding with <hi>Iulius,</hi> came to <hi>Henry,</hi> and told him, That this bold and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent Fellow, <hi>Andrew,</hi> which had done them so much Mischief, who were the Ancient Allies of the <hi>English,</hi> would assuredly be his Enemy, when he warred against <hi>France</hi>; but now he was secure, and might easily be subdued and cut off; and if the Fact were evil spoken of, it might be excused, under a pretence of his exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cising Piracy. This, if he would do, he might prevent the Losses of his own Subjects, and also gratify their King, his Friend and Ally, very much. <hi>Henry</hi> was thus easily persuaded by the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugals</hi> to entrap <hi>Andrew:</hi> In order whereto, he sent his Admiral, <hi>Thomas Howard,</hi> with two strong Ships of the Navy Royal, well-appointed,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:56771:235"/>
to way-lay<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> him in the <hi>Downs,</hi> (so they call the Heaps of Sand, which appear aloft when the Tide is out) in his return from <hi>Flanders.</hi> It was not long before they espied him coming in a small Vessel, with a lesser one in his Company, and set upon him;<note place="margin">A sharp Fight between the <hi>English</hi> Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and <hi>Breton,</hi> where <hi>Breton</hi> was slain.</note> 
                  <hi>Howard</hi> himself attaqued <hi>Andrew,</hi> between-whom there was a sharp Fight, and altho' <hi>Howard</hi> had all the Advantage imaginable against him, yet he had much ado to take the Ship; neither could he do that, till <hi>Andrew</hi> and many of his Men were slain. This is certain, That <hi>Andrew</hi> was a Man of that Courage, even when his Case was desperate, that, tho' he had several Wounds, and one of his Legs was broken with a Cannon Bullet, yet he took a Drum and beat an Alarm, and a Charge to his Men, to incourage them to fight valiantly; this he did, till his Breath and Life failed him to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. The lesser Ship, seeing that she was no way able to cope with the Enemy, endeavoured to save her self by flight, but was taken with a great deal less opposition; They which were not kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the Fight, were cast into Prison at <hi>London</hi>; from whence they were brought to the King, and humbly begging their Lives of him, as they were instructed to do by the <hi>English,</hi> he, in a proud ostentation of his Mercifulness, dismissed and sent the poor inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Souls away. Hereupon, Embassadors were sent into <hi>England</hi> by <hi>Iames,</hi> to complain,<note place="margin">K. <hi>Iames</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains to <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Breton</hi>'s Death.</note> That his Subjects Ships were taken in a time of Peace, and the Passengers slain. They were answered, That the killing of Pirats was no violation of Leagues, neither was it a justifiable Cause for a War. This Answer shewed the spight of one, that was willing to excuse a plain Murder, and seemed as if he had sought an occasion for a War: Whereupon the <hi>English,</hi> which inhabited the Borders, by that which was acted above-board, guessed at their King's Mind; and being also accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed to sow the Seeds of Dissention, in the times of the firmest Peace; and besides, being much given to Innovation, began to prey upon the adjacent Countries of the <hi>Scots.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At that time, there was one <hi>Alexander Hume,</hi> who had the sole command of all the <hi>Scots</hi> Borders, which was wont to be distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into three Mens Hands; he was mightily beloved by <hi>Iames,</hi> but his Disposition was more fierce than was expedient for the Good of those Times. The King was intent upon War, and very soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous how to blot out the Ignominy received by those Incursions; and <hi>Hume</hi> promised him, That he, and some of his Kindred and Vassals, would, in a little time, make the <hi>English</hi> repent of the Loss and Damage they had done, as being resolved to turn their Mirth into Sadness. To make good his Word, he gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther about 3000 Horse, entred <hi>England,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Alexander Hume</hi> marches with a Party into <hi>England</hi>;</note> and spoiled the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Villages, before any Relief could come in; but, as he was returning, his Men, being accustomed to pillaging, and then also laden with a great deal of Booty, being impatient to stay there any longer, divided their Spoil, even in their Enemy's Country, and went their ways severally Home. <hi>Alexander,</hi> with a few, brought up the Rear, to see that no assault might be made upon them in their Retreat; but perceiving none to follow, he was the more careless, and so fell into an Ambush of 300 <hi>English,</hi> who,<note place="margin">But is worsted in his Retreat.</note> taking
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56771:236"/>
the opportunity, set upon them, and struck such a suddain Terror into them, that they routed and put them to flight. In this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict, a great many of the <hi>Scots</hi> were slain, and 200 taken Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, amongst whom was <hi>George Hume, Alexander</hi>'s Brother, who was exchanged for the Lord <hi>Hern</hi> of <hi>Foord,</hi> who had been kept Prisoner many Years in <hi>Scotland,</hi> for the Murder of <hi>Robert Carr:</hi> But all the Booty came safe into <hi>Scotland,</hi> because they, who drove it, were marched on before.</p>
               <p>This new Offence, coming upon the King's Mind, which was not easy before, upon the account of what I formerly related, made him unruly and headstrong; and thereupon he called a Convention to consult concerning the War.<note place="margin">K. <hi>Iames</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves a War against <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                  </note> The wiser sort were against it; but <hi>L'amot,</hi> the Embassador of <hi>France,</hi> earnestly pressed it, by Entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Promises: And also frequent Letters from <hi>Andrew Forman</hi> urged the same thing; yea, the King himself inclined thereto, so that many, to gratify him, fell in with his Opinion; the rest, being the <hi>minor</hi> part, lest by a fruitless Opposition they might incur the King's Displeasure, gave also their assent; so that a War was voted to be made against <hi>England,</hi> both by Land and Sea; ('tis doubtful, whether the Counsel or the Event was the worst), a set day was appointed for the Army to meet together. An Herald was sent into <hi>France</hi> to <hi>Henry,</hi> who was then besieging <hi>Tournay,</hi> to denounce War upon him.<note place="margin">The pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Causes of the War.</note> The Causes of it were rendred to be, That Satisfaction for Losses had been required, but not given. That <hi>Iohn Hume,</hi> the Murderer of <hi>Robert Carr,</hi> did openly shew himself; That <hi>Andrew Breton,</hi> in violation of the Leagues betwixt the two Crowns, had been pillaged and slain, by the King's own Command: And though he did not mention any of those Wrongs, yet he should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver endure, That the Territories of <hi>Lewis,</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> his Ancient Ally; nor of <hi>Charles,</hi> Duke of <hi>Gelderland,</hi> his Kinsman, should be so miserably harrassed with all the Calamities of War; and therefore, unless he desisted therefrom, he bid him Defiance. <hi>Henry</hi> being young, and having a flourishing and puissant King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and besides, a general Combination of almost all <hi>Europe</hi> against <hi>France</hi> alone; these things kindled a desire in his Mind, which was otherwise ambitious enough of Glory, to continue his Arms; and therefore he gave the Herald an Answer more fierce than suted with his youthful Age; <hi>That he heard nothing from him, but what he long before had expected from such a Violator of all Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and Human Laws,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">K. <hi>Henry</hi>'s An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to King <hi>Iames</hi>'s He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rald.</note> 
                  <hi>and therefore he should do as he thought fit; for his part, he was resolved not to be threatned out of his Procedure in a War, wherein he had so well prospered hitherto; and besides, he did not value his Friendship, as having already had sufficient proof of his Levity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Denunciation of War being brought into <hi>Scotland,</hi> as the King was going to his Army,<note place="margin">A strange Apparition, of an old Man forbidding K. <hi>Iames</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in his War with <hi>England.</hi>

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:56771:236"/>
very venerable: He pressed thro' the Crowd to come to the King: When he came to him, he leaned upon the Chair on which the King sat, with a kind of rustick simplicity, and bespoke him thus; <hi>O King,</hi> said he, <hi>I am sent to warn thee, not to proceed in thy intended Design; which Monition if thou neglect, neither Thou nor thy Followers shall prosper. I am also commanded to tell thee, That thou shouldest not use the Familiarity, Intimacy, and Counsel of Women; which if thou dost, it will redound to thy Ignominy and Loss.</hi> Having thus spoken, he withdrew himself into the Crowd; and when the King enquired for him, after Prayers were ended, he could not be found; which Matter seemed more strange, because none of those who stood next, and observed him, as being desirous to put many Questions to him, were sensible how he disappeared; Amongst them, there was <hi>David Lindsy</hi> of <note n="*" place="margin">A place near <hi>Cowper,</hi> in <hi>Fife.</hi>

               <p>But the King, notwithstanding, went forward in his March,<note place="margin">Yet he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters <hi>England</hi> below <hi>Ouler</hi> in <hi>Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>

But the King thought that nothing was too hard for his Arms, especially since the <hi>English</hi> were intangled in the War with <hi>France,</hi> so that, some Court-Parasites soothing him up in his Vanity, he judg'd, that he might easily reduce that Town, in his Retreat.</p>
               <p>Whilst he thus lay encamped at <hi>Foord,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The <hi>English</hi> challenge him to give them Battel.</note> there came Heraulds from the <hi>English,</hi> desiring him to appoint a Place and Time for the Battel. Hereupon he called a Council of War, wherein the major part were of opinion, That it was best to return home, and not to hazard the State of the whole Kingdom with so small a Force, especially, since he had abundantly satisfied his Credit, his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown, and the Laws of Friendship; neither was there any just Cause, why he should venture his small Army, and which had been also wearied out with the taking of so many Castles, against the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:56771:237"/>
more numerous Forces of the <hi>English,</hi> who had also newly recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved an Addition of fresh Men; for it was reported, That at that very time <hi>Thomas Howard</hi> arrived in the Camp with 6000 Men, sent back out of <hi>France.</hi> Besides, if he retreated, the <hi>English</hi> Army must of necessity disband, and then they could not bring together Another, to be levied so far off, till the next Year. But if he would needs fight, it were better so to do in his own Country, where Place, Time, and Provision were more at his Command. But the <hi>French</hi> Embassador,<note place="margin">The French Embassador presses <hi>Iames</hi> on to a Battel.</note> and some Courtiers whom <hi>French</hi> Lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesses had wrought over to him, were of another Mind, and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily persuaded <hi>Iames,</hi> who longed to fight, to abide the Enemy in that place: In the mean time, the <hi>English</hi> came not at the Day appointed by the Herauld, and then the <hi>Scots</hi> Nobles took that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to go again to the King, and told him, that it was the Craft of the Enemy to protract the time from one day to another, whilst their own Force encreased, and the <hi>Scots</hi> were diminished, and that therefore he should use the same Art against them. That it was now no Dishonour for the <hi>Scots</hi> to retreat, (since the <hi>English</hi> had not kept the designed Time) without fighting; or else, not to fight, but when they themselves thought fit: The first of these Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices was in many respects the more safe; but, if that did not please him, he had a fair opportunity offered him to comply with the other. For seeing the <note n="*" place="margin">In <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland.</hi>

                  <hi>Till</hi> had very high Banks, and was almost no where fordable, there was no passing for an Army over it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in many Miles, but by one Bridg, where a few Men might keep back a great Multitude; yea, if part of the <hi>English</hi> should get over, he might so place his Ordnance as to cut off the Bridg, and so they, who had passed over, might be destroyed, before they could be relieved by those on the contrary side. The King approved of neither Advice,<note place="margin">K. <hi>Iames</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to fight.</note> but answered resolutely, <hi>That if the</hi> English <hi>were</hi> 100000 <hi>strong, he would fight them.</hi> All the Nobility were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at this temerarious Answer; and <hi>Archibald Douglas,</hi> Earl of <hi>Angus,</hi> who was far superior to all the rest in Age and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,<note place="margin">Which Earl <hi>Douglas</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded him from in an Oration.</note> endeavoured to appease the King's Fury by a mild Oration, and to open the Nature and Reason of the two former Advices;
<q>You have (said he) sufficiently satisfied your Alliance with <hi>France,</hi> in that you have called off a great part of their Enemy's Army from them; for, by this means, they cannot run over all <hi>France,</hi> as, by the multitude of their Forces, they hoped to do; neither can they do any great damage to <hi>Scotland,</hi> because they cannot long keep their Army together in a cold Country, already wasted by War, and otherwise not very fruitful; and moreover, the Winter now approaching, which in the Northern Parts useth to begin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times. As for the <hi>French</hi> Embassador (said he) I do not wonder, that he is so earnest to press us to a Battel, for he, being a Stranger, studies not the common good of our whole Party, but the private Advantage of their own Nation, and therefore it is no News, if he push us on to fight, and so be prodigal of other Mens Blood. Besides, his Demand is shameless, for he requires that of us, which his own King, tho highly wise and prudent, doth not think fit to do, for the maintenance of his whole Kingdom and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:56771:237"/>
Dignity. Neither ought the loss of this Army to be accounted small, because we are but few in number: For that which is any ways eminent for Valour, Authority, or Counsel in the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> is here summ'd up in a Body: If these are lost, the rest of the Commonalty will be but an easy Prey to the Conqueror. Besides, to lengthen out the War, is at present more safe, and more conducive to the main Chance. For if <hi>L'amot</hi>'s Opinion be, that the <hi>English</hi> are to be either exhausted by Expences, or wearied out by Delays, what can be more adviseable, in the present Posture of Affairs, than to compel the Enemy to divide his Force; so that part of them must attend us, as if we were continually likely to invade them; and the fear thereof would take off a great stress of the War from the <hi>French,</hi> tho with no small Toil of ours. Besides, we have consulted sufficiently for the Glory and Splendor of our Arms, which these Men (who, I am afraid, are more forward in <hi>Words</hi> than <hi>Actions</hi>) pretend, as a Disguise and Vail for their Teme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: For what can be more splendid, than for the King to demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish so many Castles, to destroy the Country with Fire and Sword, and, from so large Devastations, to bring home so much Booty, that many Years Peace will not restore a Country, so desolated, to its former hue? And what greater Advantage can we expect in a War, than that, in so mighty an hurry of Arms, to our great Honour and Renown, but the Shame and Disgrace of our Enemies, we give our Souldiers leave to refresh themselves,<note place="margin">Repartees be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the King and <hi>Dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glas</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a present Fight.</note> having gotten E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states and Glory to boot? And this kind of Victory, which is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained rather by Wisdom than by Arms, is most proper for a Man, especially for a General, in regard the common Souldiers can chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leng no part thereof.</q>
               </p>
               <p>All that were present assented to what he spoke, as appeared by their Countenances: but the King had taken a solemn Oath, that he would fight the <hi>English,</hi> and therefore he entertained his whole Discourse with great Disgust, and bid him, <hi>Get him home again, if he were afraid.</hi> He thereupon fell a weeping, as foreseeing the ruin of Affairs, and of the King himself, by his Rashness; but as soon as he was able to speak, he uttered these few words;
<q>If my former Life have not sufficiently vindicated me from any suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of Cowardize and Fear, I know not what will; as long as my Body was able to undergo Hardship, I never spared it for the Good of my Country, and to maintain the Honour of my King. But seeing <hi>now</hi> I am useful only for Advice, and the King's Ears are shut against it, I will leave my two Sons, which, next to my Country, are most dear to me, with my other Kinsmen and Friends, as sure Pledges of my Fidelity to You and my Country; and I pray God, that my Fears do prove vain, and that I be rather ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a false Prophet, than what I dread, and do as it were foresee in my Mind, should come to pass.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Having thus spoken, he took his Convoy and Retinue,<note place="margin">Earl <hi>Douglass</hi> in discontent retires.</note> and so departed. The rest of the Nobles, because they could not work over the King to their Opinion, endeavoured to secure Things the best they could, and that was, in regard they were inferior in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, (for they had Intelligence by their Spies, that the <hi>English</hi>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:56771:238"/>
were 26000 fighting Men) to advantage themselves by the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of the Ground and Place, and so to encamp upon an Hill that was near them; It was where <hi>Cheviot-Hills</hi> do gently decline into a Plain, a small Spot, with a narrow Entrance into it, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually sloping downwards: This Passage they defended with their Brass-Guns; behind them were the Mountains, at the foot of them there was a moorish piece of Ground, which secured their left Wing; on the right, ran the River <hi>Till,</hi> whose Banks were very high, over which there was a Bridg for passage, not far from the Camp: When the <hi>English</hi> had intelligence, by their Scouts, that they could not attaque the <hi>Scots</hi> Camp, without great damage, or rather certain ruin, they marched off from the River, and made a shew, as if they intended to leave the Enemy and retire towards <hi>Berwick,</hi> and so directly into the neighbouring Parts of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which was the best part of the Country, there to damage the <hi>Scots</hi> more, than They had done the <hi>English</hi> before. And <hi>Iames</hi> was most inclinable to believe, they would do so, because there was a Rumour spread abroad, either by uncertain Report, or else devised on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, by the <hi>English,</hi> that their Design lay that way, that so they might draw the Enemy down into the plain and Champion Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. <hi>Iames</hi> would not endure that, and therefore set Fire to the Straw and Huts, and removed his Camp too. The Smoke, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion'd by the Fire, covered all the River, so that the <hi>Scots,</hi> by means thereof, could not see the <hi>English</hi>; They marched farther from the River, thro' places more unpassable; but the <hi>Scots</hi> had a level and open march thereunto; till they both came at last to <note n="*" place="margin">Or <hi>Floddon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill,</hi> lying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Town of <hi>Ouler</hi> and the River of <hi>Tweed.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Fluidon,</hi> or <hi>Floddon,</hi> a very high Hill, almost unknown one to another. There the Ground was more level, and stretched it self out into a Campagn; and the River was also passable by a Bridg at <note n="â€ " place="margin">In <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland,</hi> on the North side of the River <hi>Blico,</hi> three miles above <hi>Stannington</hi>-Bridg.</note>

                  </note> 
                  <hi>Milford.</hi> The <hi>English</hi> commanded their Forlorn, first to draw their Brass-Pieces over the Bridg, the rest marched thro' the Ford, and, by the opportunity of the Place, they set themselves in Battel Array, to stop the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in their passage. Their Numbers were so great, that they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided themselves, as it were, into two Armies, distinct from one another, either of which did well-nigh equal the whole Army of the <hi>Scots.</hi> In their first Brigade, Admiral <hi>Thomas Howard,</hi> who a little before was come in with some of his Sea-Forces,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Flodden</hi> Fight, and the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed.</note> commanded the Main Battel; <hi>Edward Howard</hi> led on the Right Wing; and <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maduke Constable,</hi> the Left: Behind them, the rest were placed, as Reserves, being divided into three Bodies; <hi>Dacres</hi> commanded the Wing in the Right; <hi>Edward Stanly,</hi> That on the Left; and the Earl of <hi>Surry,</hi> General of the whole Army, the Main Body. The <hi>Scots</hi> had not Men enow to divide their Army into so many Parties, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less they would extreamly weaken their Front; and therefore they divided their Army into four Bodies, at a moderate distance one from another; of which, <hi>three</hi> were to charge <hi>first,</hi> and the <hi>fourth</hi> was for a Reserve. The King led on the Main Body; <hi>Alexander Gordon</hi> commanded the Right Wing, to whom <hi>Alexander Hume</hi> and the <hi>Merch</hi>-Men were joined; <hi>Matthew Stewart</hi> Earl of <hi>Lennox,</hi> and <hi>Gillespy Cambel</hi> Earl of <hi>Argyle,</hi> led on the third Body; <hi>Adam
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:56771:238"/>
Hepburne</hi> with his Clans, and the rest of the Nobility of <hi>Lothian,</hi> were in the Reserves. The <hi>Gordons</hi> began a very sharp Fight, and soon routed the left Wing of the <hi>English</hi>; but when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from the Pursuit, they found almost all the rest of their Brigades defeated; for One of them, in which was <hi>Lennox</hi> and <hi>Argyle,</hi> being encouraged by the Success of their Fellows, brake their Ranks, and fell upon the Enemy, in very great disorder, leaving their Colours far in their Rear. Tho' <hi>L'amot,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Resident, cried out much against it, and told them, they would run head-long to their own destruction; for they were charged, not only by the <hi>English,</hi> standing in Array before them, but were also set upon by another Party in the Rear, and so almost all cut off. The King's Body, and <hi>Hepburn</hi>'s Brigade with the <hi>Lothianers,</hi> fought it out stoutly. There was a great slaughter on both Sides, and the Dispute continued till Night; by which time both Sides were weary. There were a great many slain of the King's main Body; they, who reckon'd the full number of the Slain, as their Names were taken, according to the several Parish-Registers, out of which they were pressed, say, That there were slain above 5000 of the <hi>Scots</hi>; the loss was most of the Nobility, and of the forwardest of them too, who chose rather to die upon the Spot, than to super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive the slaughter of their Men. 'Tis reported, that the <hi>English</hi> lost as many, but that they were most Common Souldiers. This is the famous Fight of <hi>Floddon,</hi> amongst the few Overthrows which the <hi>Scots</hi> have received from the <hi>English,</hi> one of the most memorable, not so much for the number of the Slain, (for they had lost more than double that Number, in former Battels,) but for the Quality of the Persons, the King and Prime of the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty falling there, so that few were left to govern the Rabble, who were fierce by Nature, and lawless also in hope of Impunity.</p>
               <p>And yet there were Two sorts of Men, that gained Advantage by this Calamity of others. For the richer sort of Church-men grew so insolent thereby, that, not contented with their own Function, they sought to draw all the Offices of the Kingdom into their own Hands: And the <hi>Mendicant Fryars</hi> (for that sort of Monks were <hi>then</hi> counted most superstitiously religious) had received much Mony of those that were slain, to keep for them; but it being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered without Witness, they were mightily enriched by this Boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and thereupon omitted the severity of their Ancient Discipline; yea, there were some amongst them, who counted That Gain, as a Pious and Holy Fraud, alleging, That the Mony could never be better bestowed, than to be given to Devout Persons, that they might pray (forsooth) for the Redemption of their Souls out of Purgatory.</p>
               <p>The Fight was carried on so obstinately, that, towards Night, both Parties were weary, and withdrew, almost Ignorant of one anothers Condition; so that <hi>Alexander Hume,</hi> and his Souldiers, who remained untouched, gathered up a great part of the Spoil at their pleasure. But the next day, in the Morning, <hi>Dacres</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sent out with a Party of Horse, to make discovery, when he came to the place of Fight, and saw the <hi>Scots</hi> Brass-Guns without
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:56771:239"/>
a Guard, and also a great part of the Dead unstripp'd, he sent for <hi>Howard,</hi> and so gathered up the Spoil at leasure, and celebrated the Victory with great Mirth.</p>
               <p>Concerning the King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> there goes a double Report; The <hi>English</hi> say,<note place="margin">Various Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing K. <hi>Iames</hi>'s Death.</note> he was slain in the Battel. But the <hi>Scots</hi> affirm, That, in the Day of Battel, there were several others cloathed in the like Coat of Armour, and the Habit of the King; which was done on purpose, on a double account; <hi>partly,</hi> that the Enemy might principally aim at one Man, as their chief Opponent, on whose Life the safeguard of the Army, and total ruin of the Enemy, did depend; and <hi>partly</hi> also, if the King hapned to be slain, that the Souldiers might not be discouraged, nor sensible of his loss, as long as they saw any Man armed and clothed like him, in the Field, and riding up and down as a Witness of their Cowardise or Valour. And that one of these was <hi>Alexander Elphinston,</hi> who, in Countenance and Stature, was very like the King; and many of the Nobility, perceiving him armed in Kingly Habiliments, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him, in a Mistake, and so died resolutely with him; but that the King himself repassed the <hi>Tweed,</hi> and was slain by some of <hi>Humes</hi> his Men, near the Town of <hi>Kelsoe</hi>; but it is uncertain, whether it were done by his Command, or else by the forwardness of his Souldiers, who were willing to gratify their Commander; for they, being desirous of Innovation, thought, that they should escape Punishment, if he were taken off; but if he were alive, they should be punished for their Cowardise in the Fight. Some Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures are also added, as, that, the same Night, after this unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Fight, the Monastery of <hi>Kelsoe</hi> was seized upon by <hi>Car,</hi> an Intimate of <hi>Hume</hi>'s, and the <hi>Abbat</hi> thereof ejected; which it was not likely he would dare to have done, unless the King were slain; and moreover, <hi>David Galbreth,</hi> one of the Family of the <hi>Hume</hi>'s, some Years after, when <hi>Iohn</hi> the Regent questioned the <hi>Hume</hi>'s, and was troublesome to their Family, is said to have blamed the sluggish Cowardise of his Allys, who would suffer that Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to rule so arbitrarily and imperiously over them, whereas he himself had been one of the Six, that had put an end to the like In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solency of the King, at <hi>Kelsoe.</hi> But these Things were so uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that when <hi>Humes</hi> was afterward tried for his Life, by <hi>Iames</hi> Earl of <hi>Murray,</hi> the King's Natural Son, they did not much preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice his Cause.</p>
               <p>However the Truth of this Matter stands, yet I shall not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal what I have heard <hi>Lawrence Talifer,</hi> an Honest and a Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Man, to report more than once. He was <hi>then</hi> one of the King's Servants, and was a Spectator of the Fight; he saw the King, when the Day was lost, set upon an Horse, and pass the <hi>Tweed</hi>; many others affirmed the same thing: So that the Report went currant, for many Years after, That the King was alive, and was gone to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> to perform a Religious Vow he had made, but would return again in due Time: But that Rumor was found as vain, as another of the same Batch, which was heretofore spread abroad by the <hi>Brittons,</hi> concerning their <hi>Arthur:</hi> And, but a few Years since, by the <hi>Burgundians,</hi> concerning <hi>Charles.</hi> This is
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:56771:239"/>
certain, That the <hi>English</hi> found the Body of the King, or of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander Elphinston,</hi> and carried it into <hi>England,</hi> and, retaining an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expiable Hatred against the Dead, they left it unburied, in a Lead Coffin, (I know not, whether their Cruelty therein were more foolish, or more barbarous,) because he had born sacrilegious Arms against Pope <hi>Iulius</hi> the Second, whom the <hi>English</hi> then sought to curry favour with; or else, as some say, because he was perjured, as having contrary to the Oath and League between them, taken up Arms against <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth: Neither of which Exprobrations ought to have been laid to his Charge; especially by <hi>such</hi> a King, who, during his Life was not constant or tight in any one Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; nor, by <hi>such</hi> a People, who had took up Arms, so often, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Bishop of <hi>Rome.</hi> Not to speak of many of the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> whom their own Writers do accuse as guilty of Perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as <hi>William Rufus,</hi> who is charged with That Crime by <hi>Polydore</hi> and <hi>Grafton; Henry</hi> the First, by <hi>Thomas Walsingham,</hi> in his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of <hi>Normandy.</hi> King <hi>Stephen</hi> hath the like Brand inured upon him, by <hi>Neobrigensis, Grafton,</hi> and <hi>Polydore: Henry</hi> the Eighth, by the same <hi>Newberry, Grafton,</hi> and <hi>Polydore.

For, by endeavouring to avoid the Name of a covetous Prince, which his Father had incurred, he laboured to insinuate himself into the Good will of the Vulgar, by sumptuous Buildings, by costly Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geants, and immoderate Largesses, so that his Exchequer was very low, and his want of Money such, that, if he had lived longer, the Merits of his former Reign would have been extinguished, or, at least, out-ballanced by his Imposition of new Taxes; so that his Death seemed to have hapned rather commodiously, than im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maturely, to him.</p>

                  </note> was slain at <hi>Flod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> and there were Three which strove for that Preferment, but upon different Interests. <hi>Gawin Douglas,</hi> upon the account of the Splendor of his Family, and his own Personal Worth and Learning, was nominated to the place by the Queen, and accordingly took Possession of the Castle of St. <hi>Andrews. Andrew Hepburn,</hi> Abbat of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> before any Archbishop was nominated, gathered up the Revenues of the place, as a Sequestrator; and he, being a potent, factious, and subtile Man, was chosen by his Monks to the Vacancy (for he alleged, that the Power of electing an Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop, by ancient Custom, was in Them) so that he drove out the Officers of <hi>Gawin,</hi> and placed a strong Garison in the Castle. <hi>Andrew Forman</hi> had obtained great Favour in the Courts both of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> by his former Services; so that, besides the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoprick of <hi>Murray</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> which he held from the beginning, <hi>Lewis</hi> the 12<hi>th</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> gave him the Archbishoprick of <hi>Bourges:</hi> And Pope <hi>Iulius</hi> had also dismissed him, loaden with many rich Preferments, for he bestowed on him the Archbishoprick of St. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews,</hi> the two rich Abbies of <hi>Dumfermling,</hi> and <hi>Aberbrothock,</hi> and made him his Legate (<hi>Ã  Latere,</hi> as they call him,) besides. But so great was the Power of the <hi>Hepburns</hi> at that time, that the <hi>Hume's</hi> being yet at Concord with them, no Man could be found that durst proclaim the Popes <hi>Bull,</hi> for the Election of <hi>Forman</hi> to that Dignity; until, at last, <hi>Alexander Humes</hi> was induced by great Promises, and, besides other Gifts, with the actual Donation of the Abby of <note n="*" place="margin">Lying with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in two Miles of <hi>Aymouth</hi> in the <hi>Merss,</hi> near the <hi>Scotish</hi> Sea.</note>

               </p>
               <p>The Queen, whilst she sat at Helm, did this one thing Worthy to be remembred, that she wrote to her Brother, that he would not make War upon <hi>Scotland,</hi> in respect to her, and her young Children; and that he would not infest the Dominions of his Cousin by his Foreign Arms, which, of its own accord, was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:56771:241"/>
into so many Domestick Factions; but that he would rather defend them against the Wrongs of others, upon the account of his Age, and the Affinity betwixt them. <hi>Henry</hi> answered very No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and Prince-like, That if the <hi>Scots</hi> desired Peace, they should have it; if War, he would make it upon them.</p>
               <p>When the Queen, by reason of her Marriage, fell from her Regency,<note place="margin">The Nobility divided about choosing a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, in the room of Q. <hi>Margaret.</hi>
                  </note> the Nobility was manifestly divided into two Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; the <hi>Douglassian</hi> Party endeavoured, that the chief Power might reside in the Queen, and that This was the way to have Peace with <hi>England,</hi> which was not only advantagious, but even necessary, for them. The other Party, headed by <hi>Humes,</hi> preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded an Umbrage of the Publick Good, and that it was against the old Laws of the Land, to choose a Woman to be Regent; as for the Queen, they would be studious of her Honour as far as they might so do by the Law, and as far as the Publick Safety would permit, and that a sufficient Proof had been given thereof, in regard that they hitherto submitted to her Government, (tho it were against the Law of their fore-Fathers) not by any legal Compulsion, but of mere good Will, and that they were ready to endure it longer, if any honest and equitable Pretence could be alleged for it. But seeing she, by her Marriage, had voluntarily deposed her self from that Dignity, she ought not to take it amiss, if they substituted another to enjoy that Office, which she had left; and which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, by the Law, she could not hold; for the Laws of <hi>Scotland</hi> do not permit Women to have the Supream Power, no not in times of Peace, much more in such troublesome days as Ours, wherein the powerfullest and the prudentest Man alive could hardly find Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies for the many growing Evils of the Times.</p>
               <p>Thus whilst each Faction strove pertinaciously about the Choice of a Regent, either out of wicked Ambition, or occult Envy, they passed over All there present, and inclined to choose <hi>Iohn,</hi> Duke of <hi>Albany,</hi> then living with good Repute in <hi>France</hi>; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>William Elphinston,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> is reported to have burst forth into Tears, in bewailing the publick Misfortune; and his Speech affected many, especially when he came to that Point of reckoning up what Men were slain in the last Fight, and how few, like Them, were left behind, of whom none was thought fit to sit at the Helm of Government: He also told them, how empty the Exchequer was, and how it had been exhausted by the late King, and how great a Portion thereof was the Queen's Joynture, and how much necessarily must be expended on the Education of the King, and then how little part would remain to maintain pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Charges; and that, tho none were more fit for the place of Regency than the Queen, yet seeing Concord could not be had on other terms, she was forced to yeild to that Party, who were for calling <hi>Iohn,</hi> Duke of <hi>Albany,</hi> out of <hi>France,</hi> to take the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency upon him, tho he thought, that the publick Misery would be rather deferred than fully healed thereby. <hi>Alexander Hume</hi> was so violent for <hi>Albany,</hi> that he professed openly in the Assembly, that if they all refused, yet he himself would go alone, and bring him over into <hi>Scotland,</hi> to undertake the Government. It is
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:56771:241"/>
thought, he did this, not for the Love of his Country, or for any private Advantage to himself, but merely out of This respect, that, being an ambitious Man, and knowing that his Interest in the People was more upon the account of his Power, than out of any real Love, therefore, himself despairing of the place, he was afraid if the Queen should have it, the <hi>Douglasses,</hi> his Neighbours, would grow too great, and his Power would abate; for the Men of <hi>Lid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disdale</hi> and <hi>Annandale</hi> had already withdrawn themselves, and had, by little and little, betook themselves to the Clanship of the <hi>Douglasses:</hi> And besides, he considered, that the Queen, by Assistanc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Iohn,</hi> and an Embassy was appointed (the chief whereof was <hi>Andrew Wood</hi> of the <note n="â€ " place="margin">A little Town in <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningham,</hi> stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the <hi>Firth</hi> of <hi>Clyd.</hi>

                  <hi>Largs,</hi> (a famous Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valeer in those days) to call him into <hi>Scotland</hi> for the Government, both upon the account of his own Virtue, and also by reason of his near Consanguinity with the King, for he was the Son of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> Brother to <hi>Iames</hi> the Third. He being thus called to the supream Government by the <hi>Scots; Francis,</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> did not think that Office unsutable to his Interest, and therefore he fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished him with Mony and a Retinue at his Departure. Before his Arrival, in regard there was no one Person to administer the Publick Government, there were many Murders and Rapines committed; and whilst the richer sort made up their private <hi>Clans</hi> and Factions, the poor desolate Vulgar were afflicted with all kind of Miseries. The chief Robber of those times was <hi>Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Robert Stran,</hi> who committed Outrages all over <hi>Athol,</hi> and the Neighbouring Parts, at his Pleasure, having 800 Men, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more, under his Command. At length, when he was at his Uncles <hi>Iohn Creighton</hi>'s, he was way-laid, apprehended, and put to Death: But there was more Mischief like to arise from the Fewd between <hi>Andrew Forman</hi> and <hi>Iohn Hepburn</hi>; yet, the Nature of them both, and the Discord, rather of their Manners than Minds, deferred the Mischief for a season, which then was just a breaking out. <hi>Iohn</hi> was profoundly covetous; and <hi>Andrew</hi> was as great a Despiser of Mony, and profuse in his Largesses. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs and Purposes of <hi>Andrew</hi> were open and manifest to the view of all; neither was there any need that he should conceal them, because his Vices were accounted Virtues by the Vulgar, and the simplicity of his Nature did Him as much Kindness among them, as the occult Craft of <hi>Hepburn,</hi> together with his malicious Dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation, his implacable remembrance of Injuries, and his desire of Revenge, did Him. And therefore <hi>Forman,</hi> hearing as yet no certainty of the coming of the Duke of <hi>Albany,</hi> neither could he be put into Possession by <hi>Hume,</hi> seeing <hi>Hepburn</hi> resided at his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle and Monastery, which he had strongly garison'd, which were at a great distance from those places in which the Power of the <hi>Hume's</hi> might be formidable, he determined, by his Friends, to try, whether he could, with Mony, either satisfy, or at least, in some degree, abate the Avarice of the Man; so that at last they came to an Agreement upon these Terms, That <hi>Forman</hi> should remit and forgive the Revenues of the last Year, which <hi>Iohn</hi> had ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered

in, as a Sequestrator; that he should surrender up to him the Bishoprick of <hi>Murray,</hi> and that he should pay him yearly 3000 <hi>French</hi> Crowns out of his Ecclesiastical Revenues, to be divided amongst his Friends. And thus the Man's implacable Hate was a little abated, and Matters settled on that side.</p>

               </note>THIS was the State of Affairs in <hi>Scotland,</hi> when <hi>Iohn</hi> Duke of <hi>Albany</hi> arrived at <hi>Dunbarton,</hi> on the 20<hi>th</hi> day of <hi>May,</hi> in the Year of our Salvation 1515, with the exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gratulation of all good Men.

            <p>Moreover, <hi>Iames,</hi> the Natural Son of the late King, was made Earl of <hi>Murray,</hi> a young Man of such virtuous Endowments, that he far exceeded all the hopes Men had conceived of him.

               <hi>Iohn Hepburn</hi> had so insinuated himself into the Regent, by the help of his Friends, whom he had privately greased in the Fist; and afterwards by his obsequiousness, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of knowing the old Customs of the Country, he got his Ear, who of himself was ignorant of <hi>Scotish</hi> Affairs, insomuch that none was credited, in Matters of great Moment, but He alone; He was sent abroad with Commission, by the Regent, all over <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to inquire into Their Offences, who oppressed the Vulgar, and made them as their Slaves. He obtained that Office principally upon these Grounds; First of all, he acquainted the Regent, What new Discords and old Fewds there were in every County; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, what Factions there were, and who were their respective Heads: Hitherto his Relations were true, for the Things were known to all. But if any Occasion were offered to speak of <hi>Hume,</hi> he stirr'd up some to complain of his Enormity; so that by the Imputation, partly of True, and partly of Feigned, Crimes, the Regent's Ears
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:56771:242"/>
were shut against all Defence, he could make. But when he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most gone over the whole Kingdom, and expresly declared the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liances, Affinities, and Leagues which had interceded between each several Family; and had persuaded the Regent, That no Man of Power, tho' a Criminal, could be punished without the Offence of his Clans; and that, not so much for the Enmity and Conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of their Kindred, as, that the Punishment reaching to a few, yet the Example would extend to a great many more; whom a similitude of Faults, and a like fear of Punishments, out of Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies would make Friends; so that these great and large spreading Factions were not able to be punished by the Force of <hi>Scotland,</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and therefore it was adviseable to desire an Auxiliary Strength from the King of <hi>France,</hi> to break this Knot of Contumacious Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders; and that this would be of use to <hi>France,</hi> as much as to <hi>Scotland.</hi> In the mean time, the Heads of the Factions were to be kept under, and (if it were possible) taken off, yet with that prudence, that they might not think too many of them to be aimed at at once. The Heads of the Factions at present were Three; of them,<note place="margin">

               <hi>Archibald Douglas</hi> was wonderfully popular, insomuch that the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar doted on him: His Name was much adored, by reason of the great Merits of his Ancestors; besides, he was in the flower of his Youth, and relied so much on his Affinity with <hi>England,</hi> that he bore a Spirit too big for a private Man. As for <hi>Hume,</hi> he was formidable of himself, and yet rendred more <hi>so,</hi> because he was confirmed in his Power by length of Time. Neither did he stop here, but made an invidious commemoration of what the <hi>Hume</hi>'s had acted against the Regent's Father and Uncle; of all which, tho' the <hi>Hepburns</hi> were partakers, yet he cast the <hi>Odium</hi> upon the <hi>Hume</hi>'s only: He often mentioned his Cowardise in the last Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel against the <hi>English</hi>; and the Talk abroad about the King's Death reflecting upon him, together with the repairing of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> Castle, which was done by his connivance; these things he repeated with great earnestness before the Regent. As for <hi>Forman,</hi> (says he) 'tis true, he was not to be feared upon the account of his Kindred, or any Nobleness of Descent, yet he would make a great accession of strength to what Party soever he inclined, because all the Wealth of the whole Kingdom was gathered together (as it were) into one House, for he was able to supply the present Want of the Party he sided with, with Mony; or else, by his Promises, (all Things being then in his Power) he could draw many into the Partnership of the same Design with himself. This was <hi>Hepburn</hi>'s Speech to the Regent.</p>
            <p>The noted Fewds, that had passed between <hi>Hepburne</hi> and <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> were the Cause, that <hi>Hepburne</hi> was not so much believed, in that part: And besides, his Estate was not so much to be envied, for he rather loved to lay it out, than hord it up; neither was he so munificent to any, as to the <hi>French</hi> that waited on the Regent; and besides, his desire was more to join all Parties in an universal Concord, than to addict himself to any one Faction. But the suspicion of the <note n="*" place="margin">

               </note> Lord of the <hi>Marches</hi> sunk deeper into the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent's Mind, which was manifest by the aversion of his Mind from
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:56771:243"/>
him; and because his Countenance was not so friendly to him, as before: So that after a few Months, <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Hume,</hi> in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies himself to the Queen and <hi>Douglas.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Alexander Hume,</hi> perceiving that he was not entertained by the Regent answerable to his hope, began to have secret Meetings with the Queen and her Husband: In those Congresses, <hi>Hume</hi> grievously lamented the State of the Publick, that the King, in that Age wherein he could not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand his own Misery, was fallen into the Hands of an Exile, one born and brought up in that Condition; who, by a wicked Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, had endeavoured to rob his Elder Brother of the Kingdom: And, He being the next Heir, Who did not see that all his Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours were, to settle other Things according to his Mind, and then to pack the innocent Child out of the World, that He might translate the Kingdom to himself; that so, what his Father had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piously designed, he himself might as wickedly accomplish? There was but one Remedy in the Case, and that was, for the Queen to retire with her Son into <hi>England,</hi> and there to put her Self and Concerns into the Protection of her Brother.</p>
            <p>These things being brought to the Regent's Ears, were easily believed by him; but, being a Man of an active Spirit, and of quick dispatch in Business,<note n="*" place="margin">

               <hi>Iohn,</hi> the Regent, was very much concern'd at all their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and therefore he presently sent Embassadors into <hi>England,</hi> to acquit himself before <hi>Henry,</hi> that he had done nothing, why the Queen should fear him, or be in the least disaffected towards him; neither had he acted any thing against those, who accompanied her in her Flight and Departure, but that they might enjoy their Country, their Freedom, and, if they pleased, their Estates. Thus publickly he wrote to the King: But besides that, he did not omit secretly to promote the return of the <hi>Hume</hi>'s and <hi>Douglas,</hi> by the mediation of their Friends; he made them many large Promises, till he had brought them over to his Will.<note place="margin">But, upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, return home again.</note> Whereupon, the rest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned Home; but the Queen being big, and near the Time of her Delivery, was constrained to stay there, where she brought forth a Daughter named <hi>Margaret,</hi> of whom in due place: But as soon as she was able to travel, she had a Royal Accommodation and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue sent from <hi>London</hi> to bring her up thither, where she was ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably and nobly received by <hi>Henry,</hi> her Brother, and <hi>Mary,</hi> her Sister, (who upon the death of her Husband, <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> had a little before returned into her own Country.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:56771:243"/>And yet the Suspicions before raised in <hi>Scotland,</hi> were not much abated, either by the departure of the Queen, or by the return of some of her Retinue: For <hi>Gawin Douglas,</hi> Uncle to the Earl of <hi>Angus, Patrick Pantar,</hi> Secretary of State to the former King, and <hi>Iohn Drummond</hi> chief of his Family, were sent to several Prisons and banished. And <note n="(a)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Alexander Hume</hi> raises an Insurrection,</note> 
               <hi>Alexander Hume</hi> was summon'd to appear before the Assembly of Estates, on the 12<hi>th</hi> day of <hi>Iuly,</hi> in the Year of <hi>Christ</hi> 1516; but he, not appearing, was condemned, and his Goods confiscate. He was inraged at this contumelious Wrong, (for so it was in his Eye) and to drive out one Fear by another, he either sent in, or else incouraged, Tories, to commit great Outrages upon the Neighbourhood: Whereupon the States order'd the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent to raise Ten thousand Horse and Foot, to repress those Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies, and either to take <hi>Hume,</hi> or else drive him out of the Country. But before it came to Blows, <hi>Hume,</hi>
               <note place="margin">But submits, and is made Prisoner.</note> by the persuasion of his Friends, surrendred himself to the Regent, and so was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> to be a Prisoner under <hi>Iames Hamilton</hi> Earl of <hi>Arran,</hi> his Sister's Husband, who was to be esteemed as a Traitor, if he suffer'd him to escape; but the Issue of that Matter fell out otherwise than any Body expected,<note place="margin">He escapes, and creates further Disturbances,</note> for <hi>Hume</hi> persuaded <hi>Hamilton</hi> to escape away with him, and to make a Party, and so to enter on the Government Himself, he being the next Heir after the former King's Children, in regard he was born of a Sister of <hi>Iames</hi> the Third; and therefore it was more equitable, that he should enjoy the next Place to the King, than <hi>Iohn,</hi> who, 'tis true, was also the Son of a Brother, but born in his Banishment; and in all other things a perfect Foreigner, one who could not so much as speak the <hi>Scotish</hi> Language.</p>
            <p>When the Regent heard of this, he went to take in <hi>Hamilton</hi>'s Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, and, placing his Brass-Guns against it, had it surrendred in two Days. In the mean time <hi>Hume</hi> made Excursions out of <hi>Merch,</hi> and pillaged the Country about, and at length burnt down a great part of the Town of <hi>Dunbar.</hi> These were the Transactions of that Year.</p>
            <p>At the beginning of the Spring, <hi>Iohn Stuart,</hi> Earl of <hi>Lennox,</hi> whose Mother was <hi>Hamilton</hi>'s Sister, join'd himself, with a great many of his Friends and Vassals, to the Rebels. These seiz'd upon the Castle of <hi>Glasgoe,</hi> and there they staid with <hi>Hamilton</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, expecting the Regents coming. The Regent had called a Council of the Nobles of his Party at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and there rais'd a suddain Force, and entred <hi>Glasgoe</hi> Castle; one Gunner, a <hi>French</hi>-Man, was punish'd as a Deserter; the rest were pardon'd by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession of <hi>Andrew Forman,</hi> who was then a Mediator for Peace between them. The Earl of <hi>Lennox,</hi> a few days after, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd into Favour, and from that day forward carry'd it with great Faithfulness and Observance towards the Regent. And not long after, first <hi>Hamilton,</hi> and then the <hi>Hume</hi>'s, return'd to Court, and had an Amnesty for what was past; it was granted to <hi>Hume</hi> with greater difficulty than to the rest, because he had rebelled so often;<note place="margin">But is quelled, with his Party.</note> and an express Condition was added, that if he offended another time after that, the memory of his old Crimes should be again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:56771:244"/>
and charged upon him. Peace being thus setled, the Regent retired to <hi>Falkland,</hi> where he staid some Months; but hearing of great Suspicions against <hi>Hume,</hi> he returned to <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> And on the 24<hi>th</hi> day of <hi>September</hi> held a Council of the Nobility, where he endeavoured, by his Friends, to draw <hi>Hume</hi> to Court. Large Promises were made to intice him so to do; but many of his Party dissuaded him; or, if he himself were resolved to go, yet he should leave his Brother <hi>William</hi> (who by his Valour and Munificence had almost obtained as great, or a greater Authority than himself) at Home, in regard the Regent would be afraid to use any high Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity against him, as long as his Brother was alive; but he being, as it were, hurried on by a Fatal Necessity, slighted the advice of his Friends;<note place="margin">Both the <hi>Hume</hi>'s come to Court,</note> and, with his Brother <hi>William,</hi> and <hi>Andrew Car</hi> of <hi>Farni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hurst,</hi> came to Court, where presently they were all clapt up in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Prisons. And, by the advice of the Council, a few days after, were tried,<note place="margin">Are impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son'd,</note> for their Lives, after the Country Custom. And yet there was no new Fact urged against them, Prince <hi>Iames,</hi> Earl of <hi>Murray,</hi> accused him for the Death of his Father, who came alive off the Field, as many Witnesses did prove. This Fact was strongly urged, but the Proofs were weak, so that they gave it over, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted only on his private Crimes, and the many former Rebellions were objected, of all which <hi>Alexander</hi> was either the Author, or at least Partaker in them; and moreover, 'twas alleged, that he did not do his Duty in the Battel of <hi>Flodden.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hereupon, the <hi>Hume</hi>'s were condemn'd, <hi>Alexander</hi> had his Head struck off the 11<hi>th</hi> of <hi>October,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tryed and Executed;</note> and his Brother, the Day after; both of their Heads were set up on an high place, as a Terror to others, and their Estates were confiscate. This was the end of <hi>Alexander Hume,</hi> the powerfullest Man in <hi>Scotland</hi> of his Time. He, in his Life-time, had raised up the Hatred and Envy of a great many Men against him; yet, those Prejudices in time abating, his Death was variously spoke of, and so much the more, because he fell not, for the perpetration of any new Crime, but merely by the Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies (as 'twas thought) of <note n="(c)" place="margin">Chiefly by the Instiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Iohn Hepburn.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Iohn Hepburn,</hi> the Abbat. For he, being a Factious Man, and eager of Revenge, bore an implacable Hatred against <hi>Hume</hi>; because, by his Means alone, he was disappointed of the Arch-Bishoprick of St. <hi>Andrews</hi>: So that, tho he had stifled his old Hatred for a Time, yet, 'twas believ'd, he push'd on the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent (who of himself was suspicious enough of, and disaffected to, the <hi>Hume</hi>'s) to the greater Severity against him, by telling him, how dangerous it would be to the King and all <hi>Scotland,</hi> if he, at his going into <hi>France,</hi> should leave so fierce an Enemy alive behind him. For, what would he not attempt in his Absence, who had despised his Authority when present? So that the Contumacy of the Man, which could not be lenified by Rewards, Honours, nor by frequent Pardons, had need be conquered by the Axe, if he would ever keep <hi>Scotland</hi> in quiet. These and such like Insinuations, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on pretence of consulting the publick Safety, being buzz'd into the Ears of a Man disaffected to them before, contributed more to the Destruction of the <hi>Hume</hi>'s, (in the Judgment of many) than any of their Crimes. When the <hi>Hume</hi>'s were put to Death, <note n="(d)" place="margin">

obtained the Respite of one Night, to provide for his Souls Health; but, by means of his Friends, and especially a <hi>French-man</hi> his Keeper, it was suspected, upon the payment of a good Sum of Money down upon the Nail, he made his Escape.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alexander Hume</hi> left three Brothers behind him, who all met with various Misfortunes in those Days; <hi>George,</hi> for a Murder he had committed, lay private, as an Exile, in <hi>England: Iohn,</hi> Abbat of <hi>Iedburgh,</hi> was banished beyond the <hi>Tay: David,</hi> the youngest, Prior of <hi>Coldingham,</hi> about two Years after the Execution of his Brothers, being called forth by <hi>Iames Hepburn,</hi> his Sisters Husband, upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of a Conference, fell into an Ambush, laid purposely for him, and was slain, being much pityed by all; that an innocent young Man, of so great hopes, should be betrayed so unworthily by one, who had little reason so to do. When Severities and Punishments had thus ranged over the whole Family of the <hi>Hume</hi>'s, at last it fell to their Enemies share, and especially to <hi>Iohn Hepburn</hi>'s, who had been so severe an Exactor of the unjust Punishment of others; yet the Destruction of one Family, once so powerful, brought such a Pannick Fear upon all the rest, that Matters were the quieter a great while after. The next <hi>December,</hi> the Regent brought the King from <hi>Sterlin</hi> to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent desires leave to pass o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver into <hi>France.</hi>
               </note> and then he desired leave of the Nobility of <hi>Scotland</hi> to return into <hi>France</hi>; every one, almost, was against the Motion, so that he was forced to stay, till late in the Spring, and then took Shipping, promising speedily to return, in case any more than ordinary Commotion should arise, which requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his Presence. For the Government of the Kingdom, in his Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, <note n="*" place="margin">He appoints seven Deputies to govern, in his absence.</note> he left the Earls of <hi>Angus, Arran, Argyle,</hi> and <hi>Huntly,</hi> the Arch-Bishops of St. <hi>Andrew</hi>'s and <hi>Glasgoe,</hi> to whom he added <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony Darcy,</hi> a <hi>French-man,</hi> Governour of <hi>Dunbar,</hi> who was injoined to correspond with him, and to inform him of all Passages in his Absence. And that no Discord might arise, out of an ambitious Principle, between such Great and Noble Personages, by reason of their Parity in the Government, he allotted to each of them their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Provinces. <hi>Darcy,</hi> the <hi>French-man,</hi> the rest condescending thereunto, had the chief Place amongst them, <hi>Merch</hi> and <hi>Lothian</hi> being appointed to be under his Government. The other Provinces were distributed to the rest, according to each Man's particular Conveniency. Mean while, the Queen,<note n="(f)" place="margin">Q. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet</hi> returns to <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </note> about a Year after she had been in <hi>England,</hi> near the end of <hi>May,</hi> returned to <hi>Scotland,</hi> and was attended by her Husband from <hi>Berwick</hi>: But they lived not to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, so lovingly, as before.</p>
            <p>The Regent, at his Departure, to prevent the budding and growth of Sedition in his Absence, had carryed along with him, either the Heads of the noblest Families, or else their Sons and Kindred, (upon a pretence of doing them Honour, but, indeed, as Pledges) into <hi>France:</hi> And he had sent others of them into different and remote parts of the Kingdom, where they had as 'twere but a larger Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. He had also placed <hi>French</hi> Governors in the Castles of <hi>Dunbar, Dunbarton,</hi> and <note n="*" place="margin">Or <hi>Inse-Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,</hi> a fortify'd Rock lying in the middle of the Forth, or Scotish Sea.</note>

               <hi>Anthony Darcy</hi> had carried it with a great deal of Equity and Prudence in his Government, especially in restraining of Robberies. The first Tumult in his Province, which tended to any thing of a War, was made by <hi>William Cockburn,</hi> Uncle to the Lord of <note n="(g)" place="margin">A Town in the <hi>Merss,</hi> a mile west of <hi>Duns.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Langton</hi>; he had driven away the Guardians of the young <hi>Ward,</hi> and had sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed upon the Castle of <hi>Langton,</hi> relying principally on the power of <hi>David Hume</hi> of <note n="(h)" place="margin">

               </note> 
               <hi>Wederburn,</hi> whose Sister <hi>Cockburn</hi> had married. Thither <hi>Darcy</hi> marched with a sufficient Guard, but they Within re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused to surrender the Castle; and moreover, <hi>David Hume,</hi> with some few nimble Horse, riding up to him, upbraided him with the cruel Death of his Kinsman <hi>Alexander</hi>; the <note n="(i)" place="margin">

               <hi>French-man,</hi> partly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusting his Men, and partly confiding in the Swiftness of the Horse he rode upon, fled towards <hi>Dunbar</hi>; but, his Horse falling under him, his Enemy overtook and slew him, and set up his Head in an eminent place on <hi>Hume</hi>-Castle; he was slain the 20<hi>th</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> in the Year 1517.</p>
            <p>Whereupon, the other Governours had a Meeting, and fearing a greater Combustion, after this terrible beginning, they made the Earl of <hi>Arran,</hi> their President, and committed <hi>George Douglas</hi> (Brother to the Earl of <hi>Angus,</hi> upon Suspicion of his being privy to the Murder newly committed) Prisoner to <hi>Inse Garvy</hi>-Castle: They also sent to the Regent in <hi>France</hi> to call him back into <hi>Scotland,</hi> as soon as ever he could. About the same time, some Seeds of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord were sown, between the Earl of <note n="(k)" place="margin">Discord between <hi>Doug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi> Earl of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi> and <hi>Andrew Car.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Angus,</hi> and <hi>Andrew Car</hi> of <hi>Farnihurst,</hi> by reason of the Jurisdiction over some Lands which did belong to the Earl, but <hi>Andrew</hi> alleged, he had Power to keep Courts in them: The rest of the Family of the <hi>Car</hi>'s sided with the Earl, but the <hi>Hamilton</hi>'s took part with <hi>Andrew,</hi> which they did, more out of hate to the <hi>Douglas</hi>'s, than for any Justice <hi>Car</hi> had, for his Pretensions; so that both Parties provided themselves against the Court-day, to run a greater hazard than the matter they strove a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout was worth. And <hi>Iohn Somerval,</hi> a noble and high-spirited young Man, of the <hi>Douglas</hi>'s Faction, set upon <hi>Iames,</hi> the Natural Son of the Earl of <hi>Arran,</hi> on the Way, and slew five of his Reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, putting the rest to flight, he also took above thirty of their Horses.</p>
            <p>When an Assembly was summoned to be held at <hi>Edinburgh, April</hi> the 29<hi>th,</hi> 1520. The <hi>Hamiltons</hi> alleged, that they could not be safe in that City, where <hi>Archibald Douglas</hi> was Governour; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, <note n="(l)" place="margin">

               <hi>Douglas,</hi> that he might not impede publick Business, about the end of <hi>March,</hi> resigned up his Government, of his own accord; and <hi>Robert Long,</hi> a Citizen of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> was substituted in his Place. The Nobility of the <note n="(m)" place="margin">The Western No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles conspire to apprehend the Earl of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus.</hi>
               </note> West part of <hi>Scotland,</hi> of which there were very many, had frequent Meetings in the House of <hi>Iames Beton,</hi> the Chancellor; their Design was, to apprehend the Earl of <hi>Angus,</hi> for they alleged, that his Power was too great and formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable to the Publick; that, as long as he was at Liberty, they should have no freedom for Debate, or Resolution. And Opportunity seemed to favour their Design; for he, having now but a few of his Vassals about him, might be easily surprized, before his Kindred came in to his Assistance. When he perceived what was agitated
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:56771:245"/>
against him, he sent his Uncle <hi>Gawin,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Dunkelden,</hi> to them, to pacify them, whom, he said, he had provoked with no Injury, and to desire them to manage the Dispute without force of Arms; for, if they could make out any just Complaint against him, he was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, in Equity, to give them all due Satisfaction. But his Speech profited not, or being made to Men prepossessed, fierce, puissant, and greedy of Revenge. And therefore <hi>Gawin</hi> could obtain no good Terms from them, but returned to <hi>Angus,</hi> and acquainted him with the Arrogance of his Enemy, and then caused his whole Family to follow the Earl; He himself, being a Priest, and infirm too, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Age, retired to his own Lodging. Some think, he did this to upbraid the unseasonable Pride of the Chancellor, who, when he ought to have been a Promoter of Peace, flew armed up and down, like a Fire-brand of Sedition. <note n="(n)" place="margin">But he defends him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self by force, and worsts them.</note> 
               <hi>Douglas,</hi> seeing there was no hopes of Agreement, exhorted his Men rather to die valiantly, than, like Dastards, to hide themselves in their Lodgings, from whence (to be sure) they would soon be pluck'd out by the Ears, to their Deaths; for their Enemies had stopp'd all Avenues and Passages, so that not a Man of them could get out of the City: All that were there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, assented to what he had spoken; and thereupon he and his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, being clad in their Armour, seized upon the broadest Street in all the Town. He had about fourscore in his Train, but all stout re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Men and of known Valour. They divided themselves into the most convenient places, and so set upon their Enemies as they came out of several narrow Alleys, at once; the first they slew, and drove the rest back, tumbling one upon another with a witness. The Earl of <hi>Arran,</hi> who commanded the opposite Party, with his Son <hi>Iames,</hi> got to a Ford and made their escape by the <hi>North-Lough</hi>; the rest ran several ways for shelter to the Convent of the <hi>Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans.</hi> Whilst these things were acting, there was a mighty Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bustion all over the Town; and, in the midst of the Bustle, <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am, Angus</hi>'s Brother, enters the City, with a great Party of his Clan-ship. When <hi>Douglas</hi> had got this Accession to his former Strength, tho there were abundance of his Enemies in the Town, yet he made a Proclamation, by a Trumpeter, that none should dare to appear in the Streets, with Arms about them, but his Friends and Party. Those that desired Passes to depart quietly, had them easily granted; there went out, in one Company, about 800 Horse, (besides those who had taken their Flight, before) with greater Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominy than Loss. For there fell not above 72, but amongst them, were Men of Note, as the Brother of the Earl of <hi>Arran</hi> and <hi>Eg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lington</hi>'s Son. This was done the 30<hi>th</hi> day of <hi>April,</hi> 1520. To revenge this Disgrace, the <hi>Hamilton</hi>'s besieged <hi>Kilmarnock</hi> (a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle in <hi>Cuningham); Robert Boyd,</hi> a Friend of the <hi>Douglas</hi>'s, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded it, but they soon left it, without effecting any thing. The next Year, <hi>Douglas</hi> came to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> on the 20<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Iuly,</hi> bringing with him the <hi>Hume</hi>'s, which had been banished, and there he took down the Heads of <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>William Hume,</hi> which had been set up on Poles.

The Earl of <hi>Angus,</hi> Head of that Family, he sent into <hi>France</hi>; he caused the Pope, to call over his Uncle, the Bishop of <hi>Dunkelden,</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> to purge himself there from some imputed Crimes; who, the Year after in his Journy to <hi>Rome,</hi> fell sick of the Plague in <hi>London,</hi> and died: His Virtues were such, that he was very much lamented; for, besides the splendor of his Ancestry, and the comliness of his Personage, he was Master of a great deal of Learning, (as for those Times) and being also a Man of high prudence, and singular Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, even in troublesome Times, he was much esteem'd, in point of Faithfulness and Authority, even by contrary Factions; he left behind him considerable Monuments of his Ingenuity and Learning, written in his Mother-Tongue The next Year after the return of the Regent, a Parliament was held, and an Army levyed, appointed to rendevouz at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> on a set day; whither they came accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, and pitch'd their Tents in the Fields, near <note n="*" place="margin">In <hi>Mid-Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian.</hi>

The specious Pretences, cast abroad amongst the Soldiers, pleased them well enough; for if they had levyed an Army in favour of the <hi>French,</hi> lest the <hi>English</hi> might bring their whole Strength upon them, it was sufficient for that purpose, only to make a shew of War; but, if the Interest of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> were considered, Matters were not well setled at home, and their King was but a Child; so that, 'twas most adviseable for them, at that time, only to be on the Defensive, and to keep their own Country in quiet; for, if they should march forward, the blame, even of fortuitous Miscarriages, might be laid to their charge, and an account of such their Misfortunes might be required at their Hands, in a very short time. Lastly, tho they were never so wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to march forward against the Enemy, and so to slight the common Danger, as well as to overlook their own Concerns at Home; yet they were afraid the <hi>Scots</hi> would not be obedient to Command in an Enemies Country; great heed therefore was to be taken, lest, by Emulation, Envy, or late Disgusts, some notable Affront, or shameful Loss, might be received. The Regent, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving it in vain to oppose, was fain to yield; yet, that he might not seem to have acted a Pageantry only, with such vast Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:56771:246"/>
in marching his Army, as far as the <hi>Solway,</hi> he suborned a fit Person, who used to traffick into <hi>England,</hi> to acquaint <hi>Dacres,</hi> then Lord Warden of the <hi>English</hi> Marches, that some good might be done, if he did treat with <hi>Iohn</hi> the Regent. He willingly heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the Proposal, because he was unprovided for Defence, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver imagining, that the <hi>Scots</hi> would have made an Irruption into <hi>England</hi> on that side; nor, indeed, scarce believing, that they would have made any such Attempt at all. Whereupon he sent an Herauld of Arms, and had a Passport to come and go, with safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, into the Camp. The next Day, <hi>Thomas Dacres</hi> and <hi>Thomas Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave,</hi> with about twenty more brave Cavaliers, came to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent's Tent; where they had private Discourse together, all alone, each having their Interpreters. <hi>Dacres,</hi> being taken unprovided,<note place="margin">Whereupon he claps up a Truce with the <hi>English,</hi> and r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Those of the <hi>Scots,</hi> who were the greatest Hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances of the Action, to avert the blame from themselves, spread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad Reports, that <hi>Dacres</hi> had bought a Peace from the Regent, for a Sum of Money, of which, Part was in Hand paid, the rest pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised, but never paid. Thus they endeavoured to disparage the Conference, amongst the Vulgar.</p>
            <p>The Regent went again, on the 25<hi>th</hi> of <hi>October</hi> into <hi>France,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Regent, a second time, goes into <hi>France.</hi>

Whilst these Things were acting in <hi>Teviotdale,</hi> the Horses of the English Army were so terrified in the Night, ('tis not known, upon what occasion) that about 500 of them broke their Bridles, running up and down the Camp, and overturning all that were in the way; some of the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers they trampled down and trod upon; and then ran out into the open Field, as if they had been mad, and so became a Prey to such of the Country <hi>Scots,</hi> as could take them up. Hereupon, there was a great Consternation in the whole Camp, all crying out <hi>Arm, Arm,</hi> neither could the Tumult be appeased, till the next Morning. Three days after, the <hi>English,</hi> without making any further At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,<note place="margin">The <hi>English</hi> Army retreats.</note> disbanded their Army, and returned Home.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Albany,</hi> knowing, that all the Ports on the <hi>French</hi> Shore were way-laid, by the <hi>English,</hi> to intercept him in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn; being inferior in Strength, resolv'd to piece it out by Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem; whereupon, he kept not his Navy together in any one Port, but so dispersed them into several Harbours, (here one Ship, there another) that there was no appearance at all of any Warlike Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: And besides, he quartered his Soldiers in the Inland-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, that no Body could imagin, he designed to ship them; so that the Admiral of the <hi>English</hi> Fleet, who waited to disturb his Passage, till the 13<hi>th</hi> of <hi>August,</hi> was weary to rove up and down in the Sea any longer, to no purpose; and, understanding by his Spies, that there was neither Fleet, nor Army, on all the <hi>French</hi> Coasts, he withdrew his Fleet, as supposing, <hi>Iohn</hi> would not wag, till the next Spring. The Duke of <hi>Albany,</hi> being informed of the Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the <hi>English,</hi> presently drew together his Navy of 50 Ships, aboard of which were 3000 Foot,<note place="margin">The Regent arrives in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> from <hi>France,</hi> a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time.</note> and an 100 Curiasiers; and so, after the Autumnal Aequinox, he set sail from <hi>France,</hi> and by the 24<hi>th</hi> of <hi>September</hi> made the Isle of <hi>Arran</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be the same day, wherein the <hi>English</hi> burnt <hi>Iedburgh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shew'd before, how miserable the State of Affairs in <hi>Scotland</hi> was, the last Summer. The Nobles were at variance one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; the <hi>English</hi> wasted all the Countries near them; they were Masters of the Sea, and thereby all hopes of Foreign Aid were cut off. The Design of the Enemy herein, was, to take down the Pride of the <hi>Scot,</hi> and, by Sufferings, to incline him to a Pacificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; neither were those <hi>Scots</hi> that were adverse to the <hi>French</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, less addicted thereto, for they earnestly desired a perpetual Peace with <hi>England</hi>; of which Faction, the Queen was the Chief. For when <hi>Hume</hi> was taken off,<note place="margin">Q. <hi>Margaret,</hi> with her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Henry</hi> the 8<hi>th</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> persuade the <hi>Scots</hi> to break with the <hi>French,</hi> with their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force it.</note> 
               <hi>Douglas</hi> pack'd away, and the other Nobles were judg'd rather fit to <hi>follow,</hi> than to <hi>lead,</hi> in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of Matters; all those that were not Favourers of the <hi>French</hi> Interest, applyed themselves to the Queen. She, on the other side, to gratify her Brother, and also to draw the Power into her own Hands, dissembled her private Ambition, and exhorted them, saying, that now was the time to free their young King, who was almost of Age, from the Bondage of a Stranger; and also, to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:56771:247"/>
deliver themselves from the same Yoke; for the Queen now labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to strengthen her Party against her Husband, whom she long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore began to disgust: Besides, the King of <hi>England</hi> sent frequent Letters, stuft with large Promises, to the Nobles of <hi>Scotland,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring them, to promote his Sisters Designs: He told them, it was not his Fault, that there was not a perpetual Amity between the two neighbouring Kingdoms; and that he, with others, did much desire it at this time; not for any private end of his own, but to make it appear, that he bore a respect to his Sister's Son, whom he was resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to support, and gratify, as much as ever he was able. And if the <hi>Scots</hi> would be persuaded to break their League with <hi>France,</hi> and to strike in with <hi>England,</hi> they should quickly find, his aim was not Ambition, but Love and Concord only. That <hi>Mary,</hi> his only Daughter, being married to <hi>Iames,</hi> by that Affinity, the <hi>Scots</hi> would not come over to the Government of the <hi>English,</hi> but the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> to That of the <hi>Scots.</hi> That Enmities as great as theirs, had intervened betwixt Nations, heretofore, which, yet, by Alliances, mutual Commerce, and interchangeable Kindnesses, had been whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abolish'd and extinct. Moreover, he reckon'd up the Advantages, or Inconveniencies, which might accrue to either Nation, by this Union with each other, rather than with the <hi>French</hi>; as, that they were one People, born in the same Island, brought up under the same Climate, agreeable one to another in their Language, Manners, Laws, Customs, Countenance, Colour, and in the very Lineaments of their Bodies; so that they seemed rather to be <hi>one</hi> Nation than <hi>two</hi>: But as for the <hi>French,</hi> they differed from them, not only in Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate and Soil, but also in the whole course of their Conversations. Besides, if <hi>France</hi> were an Enemy, she could do no great damage to <hi>Scotland</hi>; and, if a Friend, yet she could not be highly advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; as for the Assistance of <hi>England,</hi> That was near at Hand; but <hi>French</hi> Aid, was much more remote, there was no Passage for it, but by Sea; and therefore, it might be prevented by Enemies, or else hindered by Storms. They were therfore desired to consider, how inconvenient it was for the management of Affairs, and how unsafe for the Publick, to hang the hopes of their, and the Kingdoms, Safety, upon so unconstant and variable a thing, as a blast of Wind. How much they might expect from absent Friends, against present Dangers, may be easily perceived by the Actions of the last Summer, wherein the <hi>Scots</hi> not only felt, but even saw with their Eyes, how the <hi>English</hi> did baffle them, being forsaken by their Friends, and came upon them with all their Strength, ready to devour them; but the <hi>French</hi> Aid, so long looked for, was kept back by the <hi>English</hi> Navy, in their own Harbours.</p>
            <p>These were the Allegations for a Peace with <hi>England:</hi> And not a few, being convinced thereby, inclined thereunto; but Others ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued to the contrary, for there were Many in that Assembly,<note place="margin">But the <hi>French</hi> Faction in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> oppose in, with their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</note> whom the <hi>French</hi> had brib'd; and some, who had got great Estates out of the publick Losses, for fear they should lose them, did abhor the thoughts of Peace. There were others, who suspected the readiness and facility of the <hi>English,</hi> in making such large Promises, especially since matters in <hi>England</hi> were manag'd, for the most part, at the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:56771:248"/>
will and pleasure of <hi>Thomas Woolsey,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cardinal <hi>Woolsy</hi> a self-ended and ambitious Statesman.</note> a Cardinal, a Man wicked and ambitious, who referr'd all his Designs to his own private Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and the inlargement of his Power and Authority; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he accommodated them to every turn of the Wheel of Fortune, as men say. All these did equally favour a League with <hi>France,</hi> tho induced thereunto on different Grounds. They alleged, that the sudden Liberality of the <hi>English</hi> was not free and gratuitous, but done out of Design; and that This was not the first time, that they had us'd such Arts to intrap the unwary <hi>Scots.</hi> For <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>First,</hi> (said they) when he had sworn and obliged himself, by all the Bonds of Law and Equity, to decide the thing in Dispute, and therefore was chosen Arbitrator by the <hi>Scots,</hi> had, most injuriously, made himself King of <hi>Scotland</hi>; and of late <hi>Edward</hi> the 4<hi>th</hi> had betrothed his Daughter <hi>Cicely</hi> to the Son of <hi>Iames</hi> the 3<hi>d</hi>; but when the young Lady grew up to be marriageable, and the day of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summation thereof almost appointed, he took the opportunity of a War, which arose upon the account of our private Discords, and so broke off the Match: And that the <hi>English</hi> King aim'd at nothing else now, but to cast the tempting bait of Rule before them, that so he might make them really Slaves; and, when they were desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of Foreign Aid, might subdue them at his Pleasure, and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares, with all his force. Neither was that Position a true one, wherein the contrary party did pride themselves, <hi>That an Allyance near at hand was better than one farther off</hi>; For causes of Dissension would never be wanting among those which were near; which were oftentimes produc'd, even by sudden chances; and sometimes, great Men would promote them, upon every light occasion; and then the Laws of Concord will be prescrib'd by him, who hath the longest Sword. That there was never such a firm and sacred Bond of Friendship, between Neighbouring Kingdoms, which, upon occasions offer'd, or fought for, was not often violated; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could we hope, that the <hi>English</hi> would more refrain now from violating such a League, than they formerly did, against so many Kings of their own Blood; 'tis true, the Sanctity of Leagues, and the Religion of an Oath for the faithful Performance of Pacts and Agreements are firm Bonds and Ingagements to good Men; but amongst those which are bad, they are but as so many Snares and Gins, and give only opportunity to deceive; and such an Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity is most visible in a Propinquity of Borders and Habitations, in the Sameness of a Language, and in a Similitude of Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But if all these things were otherwise, yet, (proceeded they) there are Two things to be regarded and provided for: First, that we reject not our old Friends, even without an hearing, who have so oft well deserv'd of us. The other, that we do not here spend our time in Quarrels and Disputes, especially about a Business, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in nothing can be determin'd, but in an Assembly of all the Estates of the Kingdom. Thus stood the Inclinations of those of the <hi>French</hi> Faction; and so they obtain'd, that no Determination should be made, till they receiv'd certain News of the <hi>French</hi> Supplies.</p>
            <p>When the return of the Regent was made known, it mightily rejoiced his Friends, strengthned the wavering, and kept back
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:56771:248"/>
many, who favour'd the League with <hi>England,</hi> from complying with it. He sent his Warlike Provisions up the River <hi>Clyde</hi> to <hi>Glas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe,</hi> and there muster'd his Army; He also publish'd a Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the Nobility should attend him at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> where he made an elegant Speech to them, commending their Constancy in maintaining their ancient League, and their Prudence in rejecting the perfidious Promises of the <hi>English</hi>: He highly extolled the Goodwill, Love, and Liberality of <hi>Francis,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Scots</hi>; and exhorted them, to lay aside their private Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosities and Fewds; and, seeing foreign Aid was come into them, to revenge their Wrongs, and to repress the Insolence of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, by some notable blow.

On the other side, the Queen, who, as I said before, was disaffected towards her Husband, was much

troubled at his coming, and sought by all means to undermine him. And moreover <hi>Hamilton,</hi> out of the Relicks of his old Hatred, was none of his Friend; besides, he fear'd, lest <hi>Douglas,</hi> who he knew would not be content with a second place, should mount the Saddle, and make him truckle under; so that he strove to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his own Dignity, and opposed him with all his Might.

As soon as the Noise of the Fact was spread over the City, many mounted their Horses, and pursued the Murderers some Miles, in order to their apprehension; but, understanding that <hi>George Douglas,</hi> Brother to the Earl, was in their Company, and many more of <hi>Douglas</hi>'s Faction, with the Kindred of <hi>Hume,</hi> not knowing with what intent they came out, whether to catch, or to defend, the Murderers, they desisted from their Pursuit; whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on strange Reports were divulged abroad concerning the <hi>Douglasses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for <hi>Calen Cambel,</hi> he had already withdrawn himself from the Triumvirate; and the Earl of <hi>Lennox,</hi> though he followed the King, yet, in regard the <hi>Douglasses</hi> drew all Offices of publick Advantage to themselves, he gave many Testimonies of his Dislike, and that his Mind was quite alienated from them. But they, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing confident of their Power, slighted the Reports and ill-will of others; mean while, the King, though he were us'd more indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently than was fit, that so his infirm Spirit might be the longer in Subjection to them; yet notwithstanding, by little and little, grew weary of their Government, being also alienated from them by his Domesticks, who laid to their charge Actions, some true, some false, and interpreted the doubtful in the worst sense; whereupon, he held secret Cabals with such as he could trust, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning vindicating himself into his Freedom and Liberty: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was he afraid to open the Secrets of his Heart to <hi>Iohn</hi> Earl of <hi>Lennox,</hi> one of his Nobles; for, besides his other Virtues of Mind and Body, he was an honest and fine-spoken Man, and excellently compos'd to conciliate and win upon Men, by a natural Sweetness of Manners and Deportment: Him he made privy to his Designs; and whilst they were consulting concerning the Time, Place, and Manner of it's Accomplishment,<note place="margin">At which, the Nobility is much discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to take the King, by Force, out of his Hands.</note> 
               <hi>Douglas</hi> was making many Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditions against the Banditty, but with no great Success; at length, about the end of <hi>Iuly,</hi> he resolv'd to carry the King into <hi>Teviotdale,</hi> as supposing, that his presence would be advantageous, by striking a Terror into the Licentious. Thus an Assembly being held at <hi>Ied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> the King call'd together all the Heads of the chief Families round about, and commanded them to apprehend those Criminals, every one within his own Precinct, of which he then gave them a List: They willingly and industriously obey'd this Command, so that, the Heads of the Thieves were many of them put to Death, and Others were spared in hopes of Amendment. Thus, whilst the Minds of all were very merry and jocund; they, who had a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign

               <hi>Walter Scot,</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving not far from <hi>Iedburgh,</hi> had great Clanships in the Counties thereabouts. The manner of the accomplishing their Project was thus laid; <hi>Walter</hi> was to invite the King to his House, and there he was to remain with his own good liking, till greater Forces came in, at the Noise of the thing: But their Design seem'd to be disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, either by Chance, or upon some private Intimation. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the King was carried back to <hi>Mulross.</hi> Yet <hi>Walter</hi> was not discouraged, but proceeded on strait in his Journy to the King: when he was but a little way off, frightful News were brought to the <hi>Douglasses,</hi> that <hi>Walter</hi> was at hand, well-arm'd, and a great Troop of arm'd Men accompanying him. So that there was no doubt to be made, but he, being a factious Man, and withal, good at his Weapon, did intend some Mischief; insomuch that they all presently ran to their Arms. <hi>Douglas,</hi> tho inferior in number, yet knowing that the Men he had of his own, were choice ones; and besides that, he had several valiant Persons of the Family of the <hi>Carrs</hi> and <hi>Humes</hi>'s in his Train, with <hi>Iohn Hume</hi> and <hi>Andrew Carr</hi> their Principals, resolv'd to put it to a Battel: In the very nick of time, <hi>George Hume</hi> had almost spoil'd all, who, when <hi>Douglas</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to alight from his Horse, and manage his part in the Fight; answered, He would not so do; no, not if the King himself commanded him. They fought eagerly and couragiously on both sides, as Men who had their King (the price of the Combat) their Spectator. <hi>Iohn Stuart</hi> stood near the King, without striking a Stroke, only as a Spectator of the Fight.</p>
            <p>After a sharp Encounter, <hi>Walter</hi> was wounded, and then his Men gave ground: but the Joy of the <hi>Douglasses</hi> Victory was much al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed by the Loss of <hi>Andrew Carr,</hi> who for his singular Virtues was, equally lamented by both Parties. Upon the account of his being slain, there ensued a perpetual Feud between the Families of the <hi>Carrs</hi> and the <hi>Scots,</hi> which was not ended without Blood. From that time forward, <hi>Iohn Stuart,</hi> who carried himself as a Neuter in the Fight, being afore suspected by the <hi>Douglasses,</hi> was now account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their open Enemy, so that he departed from the Court. These things were acted <hi>Iuly</hi> 23. in the Year 1521.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Douglassians,</hi> perceiving themselves subject to the Envy of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, sought to strengthen their Faction by new Acquists; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they made up the old Breach betwixt them and the <hi>Hamiltons,</hi> a Family much abounding in Wealth, Power and Number, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from Court.

               <hi>Iohn Stuart</hi> had the advantage of being highly favoured by most People; and having also privately obtain'd the King's Letter to the chief of the Nobility, who, he thought, would have kept his Counsel, he mightily strengthened his Party. And therefore in a Convention of his Faction at <hi>Sterlin,</hi> where were also present <hi>Iames Beton,</hi> some other Bishops, and many Heads of the noblest Families; he openly propounded to them the Design of asserting the King to his Liberty. This was unanimously agreed to, and tho the Day for mustering their Forces was not yet

come; yet, hearing that the <hi>Hamiltons</hi> were gathered together at <hi>Linlithgow</hi> to intercept their March, it was judged adviseable to attack them, before they join'd with the <hi>Douglasses</hi>; and accordingly with the present Force which he had, he marched directly towards them: But the <hi>Hamiltons</hi> having Intelligence that <hi>Iohn</hi> would march out of <hi>Sterlin</hi> that Day, early in the Morning had called the <hi>Douglassians</hi> out of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> to their Assistance, before. But the King, besides other Obstacles, did somewhat retard them, by pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself <hi>not well</hi>; so that he rose later out of his Bed that day, than ordinary; and besides, he march'd very slowly; and upon the way would often turn aside to ease Nature, as if he had been troubled with a Lask. And when <hi>George Douglas</hi> had in vain flattered him, to make more haste, at last he brake forth into this menacing Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, Sir, said he, <hi>Rather than our Enemies should take you from us, we will lay hold on your Body; and if it be rent in pieces, we will be sure to retain one part thereof.</hi> Those Words struck a deeper Impression on the King's Mind, than is usual in one of his Age; insomuch, that when the <hi>Douglasses</hi> were banish'd many Years after, and he had some Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to recal the rest of them, he could not endure to hear any body speak of a Reconciliation with <hi>George.</hi> The <hi>Hamiltons,</hi> betwixt fear of their Enemy approaching, and hope of Aid at hand, had set themselves in Array at the Bridg of the River <hi>Aven,</hi> which is about a Mile from <hi>Linlithgoe,</hi> they plac'd a small Guard at the Bridg, and the rest of their Forces on the Brow of the Hills, which they knew the Enemy must pass. <hi>Lennox,</hi> seeing that his Passage over the Bridg was stopp'd, commanded his Men to pass over a small River, a little above, by a Nunnery (call'd <note n="*" place="margin">A Mile above the Bridg near <hi>Linlithgo.</hi>

               <hi>Manuel</hi>) and so to beat the <hi>Hamiltonians</hi> from the Hills, before <hi>Douglas</hi>'s Forces had join'd them. The <hi>Lennoxians</hi> made towards their Enemies tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough thick and thin, as we say; but by casting down of Stones from the Hills, they were much prejudiced; and when they came to handy Blows, the Word was given, that the <hi>Douglasses</hi> were at hand; and indeed they, from their March, ran in hastily into the Fight, and soon carry'd the Day; so that <note n="â€–" place="margin">

               <hi>Lennox</hi>'s Men were grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vously wounded and put to flight. The <hi>Hamiltonians,</hi> especially <hi>Iames</hi> the Bastard, used their Victory with a great deal of Cruelty; <hi>William Cuningham,</hi> Son to the Earl of <hi>Glencarn,</hi> receiv'd many Wounds, but his Life was saved by the <hi>Douglasses</hi> his Kinsmen. <hi>Iohn Stuart</hi> was slain, much lamented by the Earl of <hi>Arran,</hi> his Uncle; and also by <hi>Douglas</hi> himself, but most of all, by the King; For he had sent <hi>Andrew Wood</hi> of the <hi>Largs,</hi> his Favourite, before, (as soon as ever as he had heard of the Fight, by the clashing of the Armour) to save <hi>Lennox</hi>'s Life, if possible, but he came, as we say, a day after the Fair.</p>
            <p>After this Victory, the <hi>Douglasses,</hi> to keep down the Faction of their Enemies,<note place="margin">Great Severity used by the <hi>Douglasses</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Lennox</hi>'s Party.</note> and make them subject to their Will, proceeded in the Law against those who had taken up Arms against their King, as they phrased it; so that, for fear of a Trial, many were forc'd to compound with them for Mony; some put themselves into the Clanship of the <hi>Hamiltons</hi>; others, into that of the <hi>Douglasses</hi>; but the most obstinate were called to the Bar: Amongst whom was

               <hi>Gilbert</hi> Earl of <hi>Cassils,</hi> who, when he was press'd by <hi>Iames Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> the Bastard, to shrewd himself under the Protection of the <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miltons,</hi> out of the Greatness of his Spirit made this Answer, <hi>That there was an old League of Friendship made between both their Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers; in which his Grandfather was always named</hi> First, <hi>as the more honourable.

               <hi>Hugh Kennedy,</hi> his Kinsman, made Answer for him, That he had not taken up Arms <hi>against</hi> the King, but <hi>for</hi> him, for he was commanded by the King to be at that Fight, and, if it were needful, he proffered to produce the King's Letters to that purpose. The <hi>Hamiltons</hi> were much troubled at his Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: For indeed, the King had wrote to <hi>Gilbert,</hi> when he went from Court, as well as to others, That he should take part with <hi>Iohn Stuart.</hi> But seeing the Battel was at hand, insomuch that he could have no time to call together his Clanship and Kindred, as he was upon the way, he turn'd aside, with those of his Family that were with him, to <hi>Sterlin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Violence of the <hi>Hamiltons</hi> was somewhat abated by this Trial, but <hi>Iames,</hi> the Bastard, burnt with a mortal Hatred against <hi>Kennedy</hi>; and a few days after, as he was returning home he caus'd him to be murther'd upon the way, by means of <hi>Hugh Cambel</hi> Laird of <hi>Air.</hi> This <hi>Hugh,</hi> the same day the Murder was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, (which he had commanded his Vassals to execute, that so he might avert all Suspition of so horrid a fact from himself) went to <hi>Iohn Erskin</hi>'s House, whose Wife was Sister to <hi>Gilbert Kennedy</hi>'s Wife; She, as soon as ever she heard of this cruel Murther, did not cease to upbraid him most grievously therewith, to his very face. Thus the noble Family of the <hi>Kennedy</hi>'s was almost quite extinguished; the Son of the Earl, after his Father was slain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but a Child, fled to his Kinsman <hi>Archibald Douglas,</hi> who was then Lord Treasurer, and put himself and his Family under his Protection; he lovingly receiv'd him, and such was the great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity of his promising Years, that he designed him for his Son-in-law. <hi>Hugh Cambel</hi> was summon'd to appear, but his Crime being manifest, he fled out of the Land Neither did the <hi>Douglasses</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise their Revenge and Hatred less fiercely upon <hi>Iames Beton,</hi> for they led their Forces to St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> seized upon, pillaged and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined his Castle, because they counted him the Author of all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects the Earl of <hi>Lennox</hi> had undertaken; but he himself went un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der frequent Disguises, because no Man durst entertain him openly, and so escaped.

            <p>At the beginning of the next Spring, <hi>Douglas</hi> made an Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into <hi>Liddisdale,</hi> where he slew many of the Thieves, falling upon them unawares in their Hutts, before they could gather them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves together for defence; twelve of them he hang'd up, and

For he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took a Journey to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> with an intent to revenge the Death of his Lord who was slain; and there he casually lighted upon a Man of the same Family and Fortune with himself; he demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of him, whether he had seen <hi>Iames Hamilton</hi> the Bastard, in the City; who answer'd him, he had; What, said he, <hi>Thou un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefullest of Men, hast thou seen him, and would'st thou not kill him, who slew so good a Master as we Both had; get thee gone with a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; all Misery betide thee.</hi> And thereupon he presently hastned on in his designed Voyage, and came directly to Court. There were then in a large Court, which is before the Palace in the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs, about 2000 arm'd Men of <hi>Douglasses</hi> and <hi>Hamilton</hi>'s De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendants, ready prepared for the Expedition, I spake of before; he, seeing them, past by all the rest, and fix'd his Eye and Mind on <hi>Hamilton</hi> only, who was then coming out of the Court-yard in his Cloak without his Armor, when he saw him in a pretty long Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, (and somewhat dark) which is over the Gate, he flew at him, and gave him six Wounds, one of them almost pierc'd to his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, others of them he pretty well avoided by the Flexure of his Body, and by warding them off with his Cloak which he held before him; and then the Groom presently mixt himself among the Croud; immediately a great hubbub was raised, and some of the <hi>Hamiltons</hi> suspected, that the <hi>Douglasses</hi> had done so horrid a Fact, out of the relicks of their old Feuds; so that those two Factions had almost like to go together by the Ears; at last, when their Fear and Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise was allay'd, they were all commanded to stand in single ranks, by the Walls which were round about the Court-yard; there the Murderer was discovered, as yet holding the bloody Knife in his hand. Being demanded, what he was, and whence and for what he came thither? he made no ready Answer; upon which he was dragg'd to Prison, and put to the Rack, and then he confess'd im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately,<note place="margin">The Groom apprehended and tortured, yet dies very resolutely.</note> that he had undertaken the Fact, in revenge of his good Lord and Master, and that he was sorry for nothing, but that so famous an Attempt did not take effect; he was tortur'd a long time, but discover'd no Body, as privy to his Design; at, last he was condemned and carried up and down the City, and every part of his naked Body was nipp'd with Iron Pinchers red hot; and yet, neither in his Speech, nor in his Countenance, did he discover the least sense of Pain; when his right Hand was cut off, he said, that it was punish'd less than it had deserved, for not sufficiently se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conding the Dictates of so stout a Spirit.

               <hi>Alexander</hi> was so astonished at that word, that he was never himself from that day forward, and not long after he died in a Fit of Madness.</p>
            <p>All this time, and for a great part of the Year ensuing, the <hi>Doug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasses,</hi> being severally intent upon other Matters and Concerns, were secure, as to the King's Departure from them; because they believed, that now his Mind was fully reconciled to them by those Blandishments and immoderate Pleasures they had indulg'd him in. And besides, they thought, if he had a mind to remove, there was no Faction strong enough to oppose them, neither was there any strong Garison, whither to retire, but only <hi>Sterlin</hi> Castle, which was allotted to the Queen for her Habitation; but then it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted for a time, by the Queen's Officers, when she hid her self for fear of the <hi>Douglasses</hi>; and when the Tumult was a little ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peased, 'twas somewhat fortified, but rather for a Shew, than for any real Defence. <note n="*" place="margin">The King frees himself from the <hi>Dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glasses.</hi>

Journey, but the Earl and his Brother <hi>George</hi> thought it best to obey the Edict. Thus they went back to <hi>Linlithgo,</hi> resolving to stay there, till they heard some more News from the Court. In the mean time, the King, with great Diligence, sent Messengers, even to the furthest parts of the Kingdom, to call in all the Nobles, who had a Priviledg of voting, to an Assembly at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> to be celebrated <hi>Septemb.</hi> the 3<hi>d.</hi> next ensuing. In the Interim, He at <hi>Sterlin,</hi> and the <hi>Douglasses</hi> at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> gathered Forces about them, but it was rather to defend themselves, than offend one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

The <hi>Douglasses</hi> being now driven to their last shifts, endeavoured to seize upon <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> which was void by the King's Departure, and accordingly they sent <hi>Archibald</hi> thither, with some Troops of Horse; their Design was to keep out the King, and so to dissolve the Parliament: But (on the 7<hi>th</hi> of the <note n="â€–" place="margin">

The same day that the King came out of <hi>Sterlin,</hi> there fell such mighty Showers of Rain from the Heavens, and the Brooks and Rivers did so overflow their Banks, that the King's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue was scatter'd into many parties, so that they came much ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rassed, and late in the Night, to <hi>Edinburgh</hi>: They were so mightily batter'd with the Violence of the Storm, that a very few Horse, if they had charged them, might have done them a great deal of Mischief.

There was only one Man found in this Assembly, by name <hi>Iohn Bannatine,</hi> a Vassal of the <hi>Douglasses,</hi> who was so bold as to make a publick Protestation against all that was acted against the Earl, because (as he alleged) his Non-appearance at the day limitted was occasion'd by his just Fear.</p>
            <p>A few days after, <hi>William,</hi> another Brother of the Earl's, Abbat of the Monastery of <hi>Holy Rood,</hi> died of Sickness, trouble of Mind and Grief, for the present Posture of Affairs. <hi>Robert Carncross,</hi> one meanly descended, but well monyed, bought that Preferment of the King, who then wanted Mony; eluding the Law against Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, by a new kind of Fraud.

They, who were the Causers of his Death, gave forth, That he had promised to bring that part of <hi>Scotland</hi> for some Miles, under the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the <hi>English,</hi> if he himself might be well considered for that Service: But, on the other side, the <hi>English</hi> were glad of his Death, for they were thereby freed of a dangerous Enemy. Six of his sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving Companions, the King kept as Hostages; but, in regard their Fellows were no way deterred thereby, from committing the like Insolencies, in a few Months they were hanged also. And the King took new Hostages of those who staid at home; for the <hi>Lid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disdale</hi> Men left their homes, and passed over in Troops to <hi>England,</hi> making daily Incursions, and great Spoil in the neighbouring Parts.</p>
            <p>Not long after, the King restor'd the noble Men to their Liberty, having first taken Hostages from them; Of these, <hi>Walter Scot,</hi> to gratify the King, killed <hi>Robert Iohnston,</hi> a noted Tory amongst

the Thieves, which bred a deadly Feud between the two Families, to the great loss and prejudice of them both.</p>
            <p>The next Year, which was 1531, there happened a matter very memorable, neither did the Obscurity of the Author, nor the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity of the Time, which made a strict Enquiry thereinto, abate any thing of Mens Admiration of the Novelty thereof. One <note n="â€–" place="margin">The strange, and (seeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) miraculous Fast of one <hi>Iohn Scot,</hi> for many weeks together, with his Story.</note> 
               <hi>Iohn Scot,</hi> a Man of no Learning, nor of any great Experience in Business, neither had he a subtil Wit of his own to impose Tricks upon Men, being overthrown in a Law-suit, and not having Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to pay Damages, hid himself some days in the Sanctuary of the Monastery of <hi>Holy-Rood-House,</hi> without eating or drinking any thing at all. When the thing was known and related to the King, he commanded that his Apparel should be chang'd and diligently search'd, and so caus'd him to be kept apart from all Company in the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> where every Day Bread and Water was set before him, but he voluntarily abstained from all human Food for thirty two days. After that time, as if he had been sufficiently tried, he was brought forth naked into publick view, where, the People flocking about him, he made them a long, but sorry, Speech, in which there was nothing memorable, but that he affirm'd, he was assisted by the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> to fast as long as he himself pleased. This Answer, savouring of Simplicity, rather than Craft, he was released from his Imprisonment, and went to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he was also imprison'd by Pope <hi>Clement,</hi> until he had fasted long e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to convince him of the Truth of the Miracle: Then they clothed him with the Habit that Priests say Mass in, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed many Presents on him, and gave him a Testimonial under the <hi>Leaden-Seal,</hi> which is of great Authority amongst the Papists: Whereupon he went to <hi>Venice,</hi> where he also confirm'd their Belief by his miraculous Fasting; and, alleging, That he was obliged by a Vow he had made, to visit <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> he receiv'd of them fifty Ducats of Gold for his Charges on the way. At his Return, he brought back some Leaves of Palm-trees, and a Bag full of Stones, which, he said, were taken out of the Pillar, which Christ was tied to, when he was scourg'd. In his Return, he past through <hi>London,</hi> and mounted the Pulpit in <hi>Paul</hi>'s Church-yard, and, in a great Audience of People, preached much about the Divorce of King <hi>Henry</hi> from his Queen, and of his Defection from the See of <hi>Rome</hi>; his Words were bitter, and if he had been looked upon of any Repute for Wisdom, he must have eaten them again; but, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing imprisoned for some time, and having wholly abstained from Food for almost fifty days together, he was dismiss'd. When he came back to <hi>Scotland,</hi> he would have joined himself to one <hi>Thomas Doughty,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Thomas Dough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> a great Cheat.</note> who about that time came from <hi>Italy,</hi> and had built a Church dedicated to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> out of the Alms the People had given him, and had got great Gain by his feigned Miracles. But the Life of this <hi>Thomas</hi> was sufficiently known to be very wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and the Cheats of his pretended Miracles were discovered, yet no Man durst openly gainsay him, for fear of the Bishops, who, by this their new <hi>Atlas,</hi> sought to prop up the Pile of their Purgatory, then a tottering; and he, to requite them for their Courtesy, when
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:56771:255"/>
any of the richer sort of Priests came to the Place, where he was to say Mass, had still one Beggar or other ready at hand, to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit himself mad, or diseased in Body, that so (forsooth) by his Massing, he might be recovered and healed. But <hi>Thomas</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected <hi>Iohn Scot,</hi> because he was not willing to admit any other into the Society of his Gain, and thereupon he hired an obscure Cell in the Suburbs of <hi>Edinburgh</hi>; and there, having erected an Altar, and furnished it according to his Ability, he set up his own Daughter, who was young, but very beautiful, with Wax-Tapers lighted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout her, to be adored, instead of the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi> But that way of Gain not answering his Expectation, he returned to his old course of Life, having gain'd nothing by all his preposterous Dissimulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Sanctity, but to let all Men know, that he wanted not a Will, but Ability rather, to become an errand Cheat.</p>
            <p>At the beginning of the following Year, which was 1532, the Earl of <hi>Bothwel</hi> was committed Prisoner to <hi>Edinburgh</hi>-Castle, <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary</hi> 16, because he had taken a private Journy into <hi>England,</hi> and there had secret Conference with the Earl of <hi>Northumberland. Iohn Sunderland,</hi> a Knight, by reason of the great Prudence, Integrity and Authority, which he had amongst all good Men, even beyond his State and Degree, was sent to <hi>Hermitage</hi> (a Castle of <hi>Liddis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale</hi>) to restrain the Incursions of Thieves and Robbers.</p>
            <p>Of ancient time, there had been no fix'd Days, nor any set Place, appointed for Matters of <hi>Nisi Prius,</hi> to be handled by the Judges, until <hi>Iohn</hi> Duke of <hi>Albany</hi> had obtained of the Pope, that a yearly Sum of Mony, as much as was sufficient to pay a Salary to a few <note place="margin">Fifteen Judges with Salary, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Matters in <hi>Scotland</hi>;</note> Judges, should be charged on the Ecclesiastical Order, and 'twas to be levied on every one, according to the value of his Benefice: <hi>Gawin Dunbar,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Aberdene,</hi> hereupon made his Appeal to the Pope, in the behalf of himself and other Priests. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy held from the 11<hi>th</hi> of <hi>March</hi> to the 24<hi>th</hi> of <hi>April</hi>; and then there was a College of Judges settled at <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> At their first Sitting,<note place="margin">But quickly disused.</note> they devised many advantageous Projects for the equal distribution of Justice, yet the hoped Event did not follow. For seeing in <hi>Scotland</hi> there are almost no Laws, but Decrees of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states, and many of them too made not for perpetuity, but tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary; and the Judges hinder the enacting of Laws what they can: The Estates of all the Subjects were committed to the Pleasure of fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Men, who were to have a perpetual Power, and even a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical Government, for their Wills were their Laws. In favour of the Pope, they were very severe against the <hi>Lutherans</hi>; and the Pope, on the contrary, to gratify a King so well deserving at his Hands, gave him the Tithes of all Parsonages, for the next Year following.</p>
            <p>This Year, the <note n="*" place="margin">The <hi>English</hi> make War up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>English</hi> perceived that the State of Affairs in <hi>Scotland</hi> grew every day more quiet than other; but yet, that they were destitute of foreign Aid, because they themselves had joined with the <hi>French</hi> against <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Emperor.</hi> Hereupon they sought out an occasion for a War. In <hi>April</hi> they made an Expedition out of <hi>Berwick,</hi> and spoiled <hi>Coldingham, Douglas,</hi> and many other neighbouring Towns, and drove away great Booty. They had no
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:56771:256"/>
apparent Provocation, neither did they denounce War before-hand. How eager they were upon War, appears by that King's Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion soon after publish'd, wherein 'twas said, that the Garison of <hi>Berwick</hi> was provoked by some licentious and contumelious Words, which the <hi>Scots</hi> had let fall. But the Words mentioned in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation carry no Contumely in them at all. But, this Cause not seeming just enough for a War, they demanded <note n="â€ " place="margin">Upon the River <hi>Esk.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Canabie,</hi> a small Village in the Borders, with a poor Monastery in it, as if it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to them, which they never pretended to, before; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, that the <hi>Douglasses</hi> might be restor'd. For the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> perceiving, that his Aid was absolutely necessary to the <hi>French</hi> King, so that he could by no means want it; and also knowing, that he had him fast in a League, wherein the Interest of <hi>Scotland</hi> was not considered; hereupon, he thought it no hard Matter to bring the <hi>Scots</hi> to what Conditions he pleased: Moreover, because the Emperor was alienated from him by the Peace with <hi>France,</hi> and the Divorce with his Aunt; and the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> did raise up Wars amongst all Christian Princes, he thought he should omit a great opportunity at home for innovating of things, if he neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected That: The King of <hi>Scots,</hi> that he might not be unprovided against this Storm, by a publick Proclamation, made all over the Kingdom, appointed his Brother, the Earl of <hi>Murray,</hi> to be his Vicegerent; and because the Borderers of themselves were not able to cope with the <hi>English,</hi> who had also a great number of Auxilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries with them, he divided the Kingdom into four Parts, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded each of them to send out the ablest Men amongst them with their Clans, and Provision for fourty Days. These Forces, thus succeeding one another by turns, made great Havock in the Towns and Castles in those Parts; so that the King of <hi>England</hi> was frustrated in his Expectation, seeing the War was likely to be drawn out in length; and other Concerns were also to be cared for by him, and therefore he was willing to hearken to a Peace, but would have it fought for at his Hands; for he thought, it was not for his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, either to offer it, or to seek it of himself. And therefore it seem'd most convenient to transact the Matter by the King of <hi>France,</hi> the common Friend to both Nations. Whereupon the <hi>French</hi> King sent his Embassador, <note n="â€–" place="margin">The <hi>French</hi> Ambassador mediates a Peace between the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Scotish</hi> Kings.</note> 
               <hi>Stephen D'Aix,</hi> into <hi>Scotland,</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, by whose Default such a War was commenced between the two Neighbour-Kings. The King of <hi>Scots</hi> clearly acquitted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self from being any Cause of the War; he also made a Complaint to him, how long his Ambassadors had been detained in <hi>France,</hi> without Hearing: And, at the Ambassador's Departure, he sent Letters by him to his Master, desiring him to observe the ancient League, which was renewed by <hi>Iohn</hi> the Regent at <hi>Roan</hi>; he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so sent <hi>David Beton</hi> into <hi>France,</hi> to answer the Calumnies of the <hi>English,</hi> and, besides, to treat concerning the keeping of the old League, and to contract a new Affinity between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> He also sent Letters, by him, to the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> very bitter and full of Complaints, concerning those matters, which had been transacted and agreed between <hi>Francis</hi> their King, and <hi>Iohn,</hi> Regent of <hi>Scotland</hi>; how that ancient Friendships, Pacts and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:56771:256"/>
Agreements were slighted in behalf of Those, who were once their common Enemies. His Ambassador <hi>Beton</hi> was commanded, if he saw that the things, he had in Command, did not succeed well in <hi>France,</hi> to deliver those Letters to the Council of the Judges, and presently to withdraw himself into <hi>Flanders,</hi> with an Intent (as it might be conjectured) to make a League, Agreement and Affini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, with the Emperor.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, War was waged in <hi>Britain,</hi> and Disputes were manag'd at <hi>New-castle,</hi> concerning the Lawfulness thereof; when the Embassadors sent from both Nations, could not agree on terms of Peace, <hi>Monsieur Guy Flower</hi> was sent over by the King of <hi>France</hi> to compose matters: The <hi>Scotish</hi> King told him, that he would gratify his Master, as far as ever he was able, and also he had some Communication with him, as much as was seasonable at that time, concerning the conjugal Affinity, about which he had sent Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors before, which were then in <hi>France. Flory,</hi> or <hi>Flower,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus the Umpire for Peace; the Garisons were withdrawn on both sides from the Borders, and a Truce was made, which was afterwards followed with a Peace: When the Peace was settled, the King having for some Years last past, transacted Business with the King of <hi>France,</hi> and with the <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Iames</hi> tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacts with the French King, and afterwards with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, about a Match;</note> Emperor by his Embassadors, about a matrimonial Contract, now being freed from other cares, his Thoughts were more intent that way, than ever. For, besides the common causes which might incline him to some potent Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, he was thoughtful how to perpetuate his Family by Issue of his Body, he himself being the last Male that was left alive; inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that his next Heirs had already conceived a firm hope in their Minds of the Kingdom, which did not a little trouble Him, who was otherwise suspicious enough of himself: And indeed, things did very much concur to raise them up to that hope; as for instance, their own domestick Power, the Kings being a Batchelor, his Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turousness in slighting all Danger, so that he would not only stoutly undergo all Hazards, but often court and invite Them; for with a small party, he would march against the fiercest Thieves, and tho they were superior in number, yet he would either prevent them by his Speed, or else fright them by the Reverence of his Name, and so force them to a Surrender; he would sit Night and Day on Horse-back in this Employment, and if he did take any Refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Food, 'twas that which he lighted on by chance, and but little of that neither.</p>
            <p>These Circumstances made the <note n="â€ " place="margin">Which the <hi>Hamiltons</hi> la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to hinder.</note> 
               <hi>Hamiltons</hi> almost confident of the Succession, yet it seem'd to them a long way about to stay for either fortuitous or natural Dangers, and therefore they studied to hasten his Death by Treachery. A fair Opportunity was offer'd them to effect it by his Night-Walkings to his <hi>Misses,</hi> having but one or two in his Company. But all these things not answering their Expectation, they resolved to cut off the hope of lawful Issue, by hindring his Marriage, what they could; although <hi>Iohn</hi> Duke of <hi>Albany,</hi> when he was <hi>Regent,</hi> seemed to have made sufficient Provision against that Inconvenience, for when he renewed the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient League between the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Scots</hi> at <note n="â€–" place="margin">The chief Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Normandy.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Roan,</hi> he had inserted
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:56771:257"/>
one Article, that <hi>Iames</hi> should marry <hi>Francis</hi>'s eldest Daughter. But there were two Impediments in the way, which almost broke off, and cut this League asunder. For <hi>Francis,</hi> being freed out of the Hand of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> by the Industry and Diligence principally of <hi>Henry</hi> the 8<hi>th,</hi> had entred into so strict a League with the <hi>English,</hi> that the <hi>Scotish</hi> League was much intrenched upon thereby; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, the eldest Daughter of <hi>Francis</hi> was deceas'd a while before, and therefore <hi>Iames</hi> desired <hi>Magdalen,</hi> his next Daughter, to Wife, and sent Embassadors over to that purpose; but her Father excused the matter, alleging, that his Daughter was of so weak a Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Body, that there was little hopes of Children by her; no, nor hardly any Likelihood of her Life it self, for any long time.</p>
            <p>About the same time, there was an Affinity treated of with <hi>Charles</hi> the Emperor by Embassadors, and at length the 24<hi>th</hi> day of <hi>April,</hi> 1534. The Emperor sent <hi>Godscalk Ericus,</hi> that the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter might be carry'd with greater Secrecy, from <hi>Toledo</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> through <hi>Ireland,</hi> to <hi>Iames.</hi> After he had declared the Commands, he had in charge from the Emperor, concerning the Wrongs offer'd to his Aunt <hi>Catharine</hi> and her Daughter, by King <hi>Henry</hi>; concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the calling a general Council; concerning the rooting out the Sect of the <hi>Lutherans</hi>; and concerning contracting an Affinity. The Emperor, by his Letters, gave the King his choice of three <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rys,</hi> all of them of his Blood; they were, <hi>Mary</hi> Sister to <hi>Charles,</hi> a Widow,<note n="*" place="margin">Three <hi>Maries</hi> offered by <hi>Charles</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, to King <hi>Iames,</hi> out of which to chuse a Consort.</note> ever since the Death of her Husband <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Hungary,</hi> who was slain in Battel by the <hi>Turks; Mary</hi> of <hi>Portugal</hi> the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his Sister <hi>Leonora</hi>; and <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> his Niece by his Aunt <hi>Catharine</hi>: And because <hi>Charles</hi> knew, that King <hi>Iames</hi> was more inclinable to this last Match, he also shewed a greater Propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion thereunto, that so he might take off <hi>Iames</hi> from his valuing of, and adhering to, the League with <hi>Francis,</hi> and at the same time might set him at ods with <hi>Henry. Iames</hi> made answer, that the Marriage with <hi>England</hi> was indeed, in many respects, most ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous, if it could be obtained, but 'twas a Business of uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Hope, but of great Danger and Toil, and would be encum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber'd with so many Delays, that his single Life, he being the last of his Family, could hardly bear it; and therefore of all <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Neices, he told Him, that the Daughter of <hi>Christiern</hi> King of <hi>Denmark</hi> was most convenient for him, who was begotten upon <hi>Isabel,</hi> the Sister of <hi>Charles.</hi> A while after, <hi>Charles</hi> answered this his Demand from <hi>Madrid,</hi> that she was already promised to another, and though <hi>Caesar</hi> by offering Conditions seem'd rather to prolong the matter, than really to bring it to pass, yet the Treaty was not wholly laid aside. Matters being quiet at home, <hi>Iames</hi> resolved to go a Ship-board to take a View of all his Dominions round about, and to curb the stubborn Spirits of the <hi>Islanders,</hi> and make them more obedient.<note n="â€ " place="margin">King <hi>Iames</hi> visits the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cades,</hi> and other Isles of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>

In an Assembly which the King caused to be convened at <hi>Iedburgh,</hi> in order to the suppressing of the Robbers thereabouts; <hi>Walter Scot</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned of high Treason, and sent Prisoner to <hi>Edinburgh</hi> Castle, where he remained, as long as the King lived. The same Month of <hi>August,</hi> when <hi>Francis</hi> (as I said before) had excused his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Marriage on account of her Health, but withal had offer'd him any other of the Blood Royal: The King sent Embassadors into <hi>France, Iames</hi> Earl of <hi>Murray, Vice-roy</hi> of the Kingdom, and <hi>William Stuart</hi> Bishop of <hi>Aberdene</hi> (those Two went by Sea) and <hi>Iohn Erskin</hi> by Land, because he had some Commands to deliver to <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>England</hi> by the way.

               <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Vendosme,</hi> a Lady of the Blood was offer'd to them, as a fit Wife for their King: Other points were accorded easily enough, but the Embassadors, fearing, that this Marriage would not please their Master, would make no Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pousal, till they had acquainted him therewith. In the mean time, <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> to trouble a matter which was upon the point of concluding, in <hi>November,</hi> sent the Bishop of St. <hi>Davids</hi> into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> who brought <hi>Iames</hi> some English Books, containing the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses's</hi> of the Christian Religion, desiring <hi>Iames</hi> to read them, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently to weigh what was written therein; but he gave them to some of his Courtiers, who were most addicted to the Sacerdotal Order, to inspect: They, before ever they had scarce look'd on them, condemn'd them as <hi>Heretical</hi>; and moreover, they highly gratulated the King, that he had not polluted his Eye (so they phrased it) with reading such pestiferous <note n="â€ " place="margin">

And next, the Priests also were mightily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it; and their Pretences were seemingly just and honest, as first, the danger he would run, if with a small Retinue he should put himself into the Power of his old Enemy,<note place="margin">Tho afterwards disappointed upon several pretences.</note> for then he must comply with his Will, though it were never so much against his Own: They also recited the Examples of his Ancestors, who, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by their own Credulity; or else by the Perfidiousness of the Enemy, were drawn into a Nouse; and from flattering Promises of Friendship, had brought home nothing but Ignominy and Loss: They also urg'd the unhappy Mistake of <hi>Iames</hi> the First, who, in a time of Truce, landing, as he thought, in his Friends Country, was there kept Prisoner eighteen Years; and, at last, had such Conditions imposed upon him, which he neither lawfully could, nor ought to have accepted; and then, said they, he was avarici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously sold to his own Subjects. Moreover, first <hi>Malcolm,</hi> after him his Brother <hi>William,</hi> Kings of <hi>Scotland,</hi> were brought on the Stage, who were inticed to <hi>London</hi> by <hi>Henry</hi> the 2<hi>d.</hi> and then carried over into <hi>France,</hi> to make a shew of assisting in a War there, against the <hi>French</hi> King, their old Ally. But (say they) if it be objected, <hi>Henry</hi> the 8<hi>th</hi> will do none of these things; they answered first, How shall we be assured of that? next, Is it not a point of high Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence, to venture ones Fortune, Life and Dignity, which are now in ones own Power, into the Hands of another? Besides, the Priests saw, that all their Concerns were now at stake, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they must, now or never, stand up for them; in order where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, they caused <hi>Iames Beton,</hi> Arch-bishop of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> and <hi>George Creighton,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Dunkelden,</hi> two old decrepit Men, to come to Court, there to baul it out, That Religion would be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed by this Meeting and Interview, even, That Religion, (said they) which had been observed so many Ages by their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors; and which had all along preserved its Defenders, till now; The Ruin of which would be attended with the total Destruction of the Kingdom, also; to forsake that Religion, upon every light Grounds, especially in such a time, wherein the whole World doth conspire together, with Arms in their Hands, for its Preservation, could not be done without great Danger at present, and Infamy for future; yea, it would be a thing of great Wickedness and Impiety also. With these Engines they battered <hi>Iames</hi>'s Mind, which, of it self, was inclined enough to Superstition; and moreover, they corrupted those Courtiers, who could do most with him, desiring them, in their Names, to promise him a great Sum of Mony; so that hereby, they wholly turned away his Mind from the Thoughts of an Interview. <note n="*" place="margin">

(as indeed he had reason so to do) and thus the Seeds of Dissension were again sown between the two Kings.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the King was weary of his single Life, and by reason of foreign Embassies, and his Court-Distractions at home, was variously agitated in his Thoughts; all pretended the publick Good, but some aimed at their own private Advantage under that Vail, and though many persuaded him to an Affinity with <hi>Charles,</hi> in regard of the flourishing Estate of the <hi>Empire</hi> at that time, yet he rather inclined to an Alliance with <hi>France.</hi> And therefore, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the matter could not be ended by Embassadors,<note place="margin">King <hi>Iames</hi> sails over in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>France,</hi>

But a Tempest arising, and being also toss'd with contrary Winds, the Pilot ask'd him, what course he should steer? If there be a necessity, said he, <hi>Land me any where but in</hi> England: Then his Mind was understood. He might have return'd home, but he was willing rather to sail round <hi>Scotland,</hi> and to try the Western Ocean; there also he had very bad Weather, and by the advice of a few of his Domesticks as he was asleep, he was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried back again; when he was awake, he took the matter in such great Indignation, that for ever after he bore an implacable Hatred against <hi>Iames Hamilton,</hi> (whom he also disgusted before, upon the account of the killing the Earl of <hi>Lennox</hi>) neither was he well pleased with the rest of the Authors of that Counsel, ever after; and there were some, who, in compliance with the King's angry Humour, buzz'd him in the Ears, That the <hi>Hamiltons</hi> under a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of a serviceable Attendance and Duty, had accompany'd him on purpose to undermine his Voyage. However he put to Sea again with a great Train of Nobles, <hi>September</hi> the 1<hi>st,</hi> and in ten days arrived at <hi>Diep</hi> in <hi>Normandy</hi>; from thence, that he might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the News of his Arrival, he went disguis'd, and in great speed to the Town of <hi>Vendosme,</hi> where the Duke then was, and saw his Daughter, which pleased him not, so that he presently made haste to Court; he came unexpectedly upon <hi>Francis</hi> and the whole Court, and yet was honourably receiv'd by him; and on the 26<hi>th</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> almost against his Will,<note place="margin">And marries <hi>Magdalene,</hi> that King's Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</note> he bestow'd in Marriage his Daughter <hi>Magdalene</hi> upon him; For her Father (as I related before) judging his eldest Daughter, by reason of her sickly temper, unfit to bear Children, offer'd him his youngest, or any other Woman of the <hi>French</hi> Nobility, for a Wife: but <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Magdalene</hi> had contracted a Friendship by Messengers, which was confirmed by the mutual Sight, Meeting and Discourse one with another, so that neither of them could be diverted from their purpose. The Marriage was celebrated <hi>Ianuary</hi> the 1<hi>st,</hi> in the Year 1537, to the great Joy of all: and they both arrived in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> the 28<hi>th</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> being attended by a <hi>French</hi> Navy.

               <g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and was either privy to, or else Partaker or Author of, all his bad Actions: He, being not as much respected by him, as he thought he deserv'd, deserted him, and apply'd himself to his Enemy,<note place="margin">

               <hi>Huntly</hi>; and before him, accused <hi>Forbes</hi> of Treason, or (as many think) he there plotted the Accusation, with <hi>Huntly</hi> himself, against him) <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Forbes,</hi> many Years before, had a Design to kill the King. The Crime was not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently prov'd against him,<note place="margin">'Twas thought unjustly.</note> nor by fit and unexceptionable Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, neither was the Plot of his Adversaries the <hi>Huntlys</hi> against his Life, hid in the Process; yet, on the 14<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Iuly,</hi> the Judges, who were most of <hi>Huntly</hi>'s Faction, condemn'd him, and he had his Head struck off. His Punishment was the less lamented, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, though Men believed him guiltless, as to the Crime he suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for; yet, they counted him worthy of Death, for the Flagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiousness of his former Life. <hi>Straughan,</hi> the Discoverer, because he had concealed so foul an Offence so long; was banish'd <hi>Scotland,</hi> and liv'd many Years after in <hi>France,</hi> so deboistly and filthily, that Men thought him a fit Instrument for any wicked Prank whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. The King, not long after, as if he had repented of his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity against <hi>Forbes,</hi> took another Brother of the <hi>Forbes</hi>'s into his Family, and another he advanced to a rich Match, restoring to them their Estate, which had been confiscate.</p>
            <p>A few Days after, there was another Trial, which, on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Family of the accused Parties, the Novelty of the Wickedness charged on them, and the heinousness of the Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was very lamentable. <hi>Ioan Douglas,</hi> Sister to the Earl of <hi>Angus,</hi>

All these, tho they lived continually in the Country, far from Court, and their Friends and Servants could not be brought to witness any thing against them, yet were put on the Rack, to make them confess, and so were condemn'd, and shut

up in <hi>Edinburgh</hi>-Castle. The fifth day after <hi>Forbes</hi> was executed, <hi>Ioan Douglas</hi> was burnt alive,<note place="margin">For which she suffers Death, being burnt alive.</note> with the great Commiseration of all the Spectators: The Nobleness, both of her self and Husband, did much affect the Beholders; besides, she was in the vigour of her Youth, much commended for her rare Beauty, and, in her very Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, she shewed a manlike Fortitude. But that which Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were most concern'd for, was, That they thought the Enmity against her Brother, who was banish'd, did her more prejudice than her own (objected) Crime: Her Husband endeavoured to escape out of the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> but the Rope being too short, to let him down to the Foot of the Rock, he brake almost all the Bones of his Body in the Fall, and so ended his Days. Their Son, a young Man, and of greater innocent Simplicity, than to have the Suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of such a Wickedness justly charged upon him, was shut up Prisoner in the Castle; and, after the King's Death, was released, and recovered the Estate, which had been taken away from his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents. Their Accuser was <hi>William Lyons</hi>; he afterwards perceiving, that so eminent a Family was like to be ruined by his false Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, repented when it was too late, and confess'd his Offence to the King; and yet he could not prevail, to prevent the Punishment of the Condemned, or to hinder their Estates from being confiscate.</p>

Also this Year, and the former, Matters were rather some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what hushed than fully composed; some Men wanting rather a Leader, than an Occasion, to rebel: For, tho many desired it, yet no Man durst openly avow himself Head of any Insurrection. And now the King having Heirs to succeed him, and thereby be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming more confident of his Settledness and Establishment, began to slight the Nobility, as a sluggish and unwarlike Generation, and not likely to attempt any thing against him, whose Family was now rivetted and confirmed by Issue-Male: So that he applied his Mind to sumptuous and unnecessary Buildings; he stood in need of Mony for that Work; and, in regard he was as Covetous as he was Indigent, both Factions of Nobles and Priests were equally afraid, and each of them indeavoured to avert the Tempest from falling upon them, that it might light on the Other. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, whenever the King complain'd of the Lowness of his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer amongst his Friends, One Party would extol the Riches of the Other, as if it were a Prey ready for the Seisure; and the King hearkned sometimes to the One, and sometimes to the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:56771:260"/>
and so kept both in Suspence, between hope and fear: So that when <note n="*" place="margin">Ambassadors from <hi>England,</hi> to desire an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview at <hi>York.</hi>
               </note> Ambassadors came at that time out of <hi>England,</hi> to Court, to desire the King to give his Uncle a Meeting at <hi>York,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising some mighty Advantages by that Interview, and making a large Harangue concerning the Love and Good-will of their King towards him: The Faction, which was adverse to the Priests, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded him, by all means, to meet at the Time and Place appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: When the Sacerdotal Party heard of this, they thought their Order would be quite undone, if they did not hinder the Meeting; and so disturb the Concord, by casting in Seeds of Discord betwixt the King and his Nobles. And, considering of all ways how to effect it, no Remedy seemed more ready at hand for the present Malady, than to attempt the King's Mind, which was not able to resist Offers of Mony, by the Promises of large Subsidies; whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">Which the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Ecclesiasticks prevent.</note> they set before his Eyes the Greatness of the Danger, the doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and uncertain Credit of an Enemies Promise; that he might have a great Sum of Mony at home, and more easily procurable. First of all, They promised to give him of their own, 30000 Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cats of Gold, year by year; and all the rest of their Estates also should be at his Service; besides, enough to obviate future Emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies, if any hapned; and as for those, who rebelled against the Authority of the <hi>Pope,</hi> and the King's, and so endeavoured to trouble the Peace of the Church, by new and wicked Errors; and thereby would subvert all Piety, overthrow the Rights of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistracy, and cancel Laws of so long standing; out of their Estates he might get above an hundred thousand Ducats more, yearly, into his Exchequer, by way of Confiscation, if he would permit them to nominate a Lord-Chief-Justice in the Case, because they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves could not, by Law, sit in Capital Causes to condemn any Man. And that, in the managing the Process against them, there would be no danger, nor any Delay in passing Sentence, seeing so many thousand Men were not afraid to take the Books of the Old and New Testament into their Hands; to discourse concerning the Power of the Pope; to contemn the ancient Ceremonies of the Church; and to detract from that Reverence and Observance, which was due to Religious Persons, consecrated to God's Service. This they urged upon him with such Vehemency, that he appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them a Judg, according to their own Hearts, and that was <note n="â€–" place="margin">

               <hi>Iames Hamilton,</hi> base Brother to the Earl of <hi>Arran</hi>; him they had oblig'd by great Gratuities before; and besides, he was resolv'd to concili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate the King's Favour, (who long since had been offended with him) with the Perpetration of some atoning Fact, though never so cruel.</p>
            <p>About the same time, there came into <hi>Scotland, Iames Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> Sheriff of <hi>Linlithgoe,</hi> and Cousin-German to the former <hi>Iames:</hi> He, after a long Banishment, when he had commenced a Suit against <hi>Iames</hi> the Bastard, and had obtained leave to return, for a time, to his own Country; understanding in what Danger he and the rest of the Favourers of the Reformed Doctrine, were in, sent his Son in a Message to the King, as he was about to pass over into <hi>Fife</hi>; and having gotten him opportunely, before he went aboard, he
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:56771:260"/>
filled his Head, which was naturally suspicious, with fearful Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages, That this Commission granted to <hi>Hamilton,</hi> would be a Capital Matter, and pernicious to the whole Kingdom, unless he did prevent this Sophistry by another Wile. The King, who was then hastning into <hi>Fife,</hi> sent the young Man back to <hi>Edinburgh</hi> to the Court, called the <hi>Exchequer</hi>-Court, where he also commanded to assemble <hi>Iames Lermont, Iames Kircaldy,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Erskin,</hi> of whom one was the Master of the Houshold, the other Lord High Treasurer, neither of them averse from the Reformed Religion; the Third was highly of the Popish Faction, and his Secretary. These were all ordered to meet: And the King commanded them to give the same Credit to the Messenger, as they would do to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, if he were present; and so took the Ring off his Finger, and sent it them as a known Token between them: They laid their Heads together, and apprehended <hi>Iames</hi> just after he had dined, and had fitted himself for his Journy, and committed him Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to the Castle. But having Intelligence by their Spies at Court, that the King was pacified, and that he would be released, besides the publick Danger, they were afraid also for their particular selves, lest a Man, factious and potent, being released, after he had been provoked by so great an Affront and Ignominy,<note place="margin">But prevented from executing his Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</note> should after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards study a cruel and bitter Revenge against them: Whereupon they speedily hastned to Court, and inform'd the King of the Immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency of the Danger, of the naughty Disposition, Fierceness and Power of the Man, all which they augmented, to raise the greater suspicion upon him;<note place="margin">Imprisoned,</note> so that they persuaded the King not to suffer so crafty, and withal so puissant, a Person, being also provoked by this late Disgrace, to be set at Liberty, without a legal Trial. Whereupon the King came to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Seton,</hi> where he caused <hi>Iames</hi> to be brought to his Trial,<note place="margin">Tried,</note> and in a Court legally constituted, according to the Custom of the Country, he was condemned, and had his Head struck off,<note place="margin">Condemned, and put to Death.</note> his Body was cut up after his Execution, and his Quarters hanged up in the publick Places of the City. The Crimes objected against him, in behalf of the King, were, That on a certain Day he had broke open the King's Bed-Chamber, and had designed to kill him, and that he had driven on secret Designs with the <hi>Douglasses,</hi> who were declared publick Enemies. Few were grieved for his Death, (because of the Wickedness of his former Life) save only his own Kindred, and the Sacerdotal Order, who had placed all the Hopes of their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, in a manner, upon his Life only.</p>
            <p>From that time forward, the King increased in his Suspicions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Nobility; and besides, he was exercised with sundry distracting Cares, insomuch that his unquiet Mind was much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with Dreams in the Night.<note place="margin">King <hi>Iames</hi> presaging Dream.</note> There was One more remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than the rest, which was much talked of, That in his Sleep, he saw <hi>Iames Hamilton,</hi> running at him with his drawn Sword, and that he, first, cut off his Right Arm, then his Left, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him shortly to come, and take away his Life, and then disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared; when he awoke in a Fright, and pondering many things about the Event of his Dream, at last Word was brought him, that

               <hi>Oliver Sinclare</hi> was lifted up on high by those of his Faction, and, leaning upon two Spears, caused the King's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to be read; at which, the whole Army was so offended, and especially <hi>Maxwel,</hi> that they broke their Ranks and ran in, higly piggly, one among another: Their Enemies, tho accustomed to Wars, yet never hoped for so great an Advantage, when, from the upper Ground, they beheld all things in such a Confusion amongst them, ran in upon them with a great Shout, (as their manner is) and so assaulted them as they were in a Fright, and hovering be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the design of Flying or Fighting; and thus Horse, Foot and Baggage were all driven confusedly into the next Marshes, where many were taken by the <hi>English,</hi> more by the <hi>Scotish</hi> Moss-Troo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and sold to the <hi>English.</hi> When this loss of his Army was brought to the King, who was not far off, he was moved, beyond measure, with Indignation, Anger and Grief, insomuch, that his Mind was distracted Two ways; sometimes, to take Revenge of the perfidiousness of his own People, (as he called it) and sometimes to make Preparation for a new War, and Retrieval of his Affairs.

concerning weighty Matters, even on the High-way, as he rode on a Journy, with a great deal of Readiness and Prudence: He was of easy Access, even to the poorest. But his great Virtues were almost equalled by as many Vices, yet they had this Allevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, That they seemed imputable rather to the Time he lived in, than to his own Disposition and Nature. For such an universal Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiousness had over-run All, that Publick Discipline could not be retrieved, but with a great deal of Severity and Strictness. That which made him so covetous of Money, was, That, when he was under the Tutelage of others, he was educated in great Parsimony, and as soon as ever he came to be of Age, he entered into an empty Palace; for all his Houshold-Stuff was embezill'd: So that, all the Rooms of his House were to be new-furnish'd, at once; and his Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians had expended his own proper Patrimony on those uses, which he wholly disapproved; besides, the Instructors of him in his Youth, made him more inclinable to Women, because, by that means, they hoped to have him longer under their Tuition. A great part of the Nobility did not much lament his Death, because he had banished some of them, and kept many others in Prison, and many, for fear of his Severity (a fresh Disgust being now added to their former Contempt) chose rather to surrender themselves to the <hi>English</hi> King, their Enemy, than to commit themselves to the Anger of their own King.</p>

            <p>THE King dying in the Flower of his Age, rather of Grief than any Disease; the Tumults of the former Times were rather hush'd asleep than compos'd, so that wise Men fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saw so great a Tempest impending over <hi>Scotland,</hi> as they had never heard of the like in ancient Records, nor had themselves seen any like: The King had not so much as ordered his own Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mestick Affairs, but had left a Daughter, born about 8 Days before his Death, Heiress to the Crown; as for those of the Nobility, who had born any sway, either they were kill'd in Battel, or else were banish'd, or taken Prisoners by the Enemy. And if they had been at home, yet, by reason of private Animosities, or of Dissension on the account of Religion, which were stifled out of fear, during the King's Life; but now, that Restraint being taken off, were likely to break forth, they were at Discord amongst themselves, so that they were not likely to act like sober Men.</p>
            <p>And besides, they had War abroad against a most Puissant King, and how he would use his Victory, every one spoke severally accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his Hope or Fear. He that was the second Heir, and next to the Crown, as he was not commonly reported to have much of Virtue, even for the management of his private Life, so he was as little noted for Counsel or Valour to manage a Kingdom. As for the <note place="margin">Cardinal <hi>Beton</hi> suborns a false Will of King <hi>Iames,</hi> therein nominating himself with three Assessors to he Vice-geren<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Cardinal,</hi> he thinking that, in these publick Calamities, he might have an Opportunity to greaten himself, that he might shew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self <hi>Some body,</hi> both to his own Order, and also to the <hi>French</hi> Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, undertook an Attempt both bold and impudent. For he hired <hi>Henry Balfore,</hi> a Mercenary Priest, to suborn a false Will of the Kings, wherein he himself was nominated to the Supream Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, with Three of the Potentest of the Nobility, to be his Assessors. He conceived an hope, that his Project would succeed, from the Disposition of the Earl of <hi>Arran,</hi> which was not turbulent, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inclinable to quietness and rest. And besides, he was near of Kin to him, for he was Son to the Cardinal's Aunt: And further, he was one of those Three Persons, who was assum'd into a Partner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship in the Government. Moreover, the Opportunity to invade the Supream Power seem'd to require haste, that he might prevent the return of the Prisoners, and of those that were banished, out of <hi>England,</hi> That so they might have no Hand in conferring of this Honour upon him, for he was afraid of their Power and Popularity; neither did he doubt, but that their Minds were alienated from him upon the score of a different Religion: That was the Cause, that presently after the King's Death he published the Edict, concerning
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:56771:263"/>
the chusing of four Governours for the Kingdom. He also bribed some of the Nobles by Promises and Gifts to ingage them to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and especially the Queen, who was somewhat disaffected to the adverse Party. But <hi>Hamilton,</hi> the Head of the contrary Faction, was a Man not ambitious,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hamilton</hi> oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</note> but rather willing to live in quiet, (as was offer'd him) if his Kindred would have suffer'd him, but they studying their own Humour and Interest, rather than his Honour, Night and Day puffed up the Mind of the young Gentleman, with strange Hopes, and advised him by no means to let slip so fair an Opportunity put into his Hands, for they had rather have Things all in a Combustion, than to live in a fix'd and private condition of Life. And besides, the Hatred of the Cardinal got them some Friends, and the Indignity of their Bondage under a Mercenary Priest. They had also some appearance of hope, which, tho uncertain in it self, yet was not inefficacious to stir up Mens Endeavours, That seeing <hi>Hamilton</hi> was the next Heir, many of them entertained such Thoughts as these, That a Female, so few days old, and which was the only Person betwixt him and the Crown, might meet with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Mischances, either casually, or by the fraud of her Supervisors, before she came to be Marriageable. Thus they laid the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Greatness of the <hi>Hamilton</hi>'s for a long time after, yet so that it seemed most adviseable to them, not to neglect the Advantage which the present State of Things did offer, and thus to cherish an hope of the future Advancement of the <hi>Hamilton</hi>'s, and if that hope did deceive them, yet it would not be difficult for them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain the Favour, or at least the Pardon, of a new Princess, who in the beginning of her Reign would study to win the Respects of all Men.</p>
            <p>Whilst Things were at this pass in <hi>Scotland,</hi> the King of <hi>England,</hi> out of his extraordinary Joy for so unexpected a Victory, sent for the chief of the <hi>Scotish</hi> Prisoners up to <hi>London,</hi> where after they had been imprison'd in the Tower, two Days; on St. <hi>Thomas</hi> day, which was the 20<hi>th</hi> of <hi>December,</hi> they were brought all through the City, where it was the longest, as if they were to be shown as a publick Spectacle to the People, and coming to <hi>Whitehal,</hi> the King's Court, they were sharply reprov'd by the <hi>Chancellor,</hi> as Violators of the League; and after he had made a large Discourse concerning the Goodness and Clemency of his King, who had remitted much of that Rigour of Justice, he might have used towards them, they were distributed into several Families, as to a larger Prison. There were seven of the Nobility, and twenty four of the Gentry, besides. But when the News came three days after, That the King of <hi>Scots</hi> was dead, and had left one only Daughter, his Heiress. <hi>Henry</hi> thought it a fit opportunity to conciliate and unite the Minds both of <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>English</hi> in a Band of Concord, by espousing his Son to their Queen. Upon this, he recalled the Prisoners to Court, and imployed some fit Persons to feel their Pulses in the Case, where being kindly entertained, and promising to afford their Assistance towards the Match, as far as they might, without detriment to the Publick, or their own Dishonour; on the First of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> at the beginning of the Year 1543, they were all released and sent back
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:56771:263"/>

               </note> they were free, and so returned home. There returned also with them the <hi>Douglas</hi>'s, two Brothers, being restored to their Country, now fifteen Years after their Banishment. They were all received with the Gratulation of the major part of the People. The Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal, who saw that this Storm gathered against him, as making no doubt, but the Prisoners and the Exiles would be both his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariants in the Parliament, had taken care to be chosen <hi>Regent</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their coming, but he injoy'd not that Honour long; for within a few days, his Fraud, in counterfeiting the King's Will and Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, being discovered, he was thrown out of his Place, and <note n="*" place="margin">The Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal's Cheat dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, and thereupon <hi>Iames Hamilton,</hi> Earl of <hi>Arran,</hi> chosen Regent.</note> 
               <hi>Iames Hamilton</hi> Earl of <hi>Arran</hi> made <hi>Regent</hi>: That which occasioned his setting up, was, because some were willing to curry favour with him, as the next Heir of the Crown; Others foresaw, so long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the Cruelty of the Cardinal in matters of Religion, and therefore provided against it, by lessening his Power. Their Fear was increas'd upon this ground, that there was found amongst the King's Papers, after his Death, a List, wherein the Names of above 300 of the Nobility were contained as Criminals, and amongst them, He, now chosen Regent, was first to have been questioned. Whereupon, his Election was very grateful to the most, because it seem'd the most probable <hi>Medium</hi> to ease the Grievances of many, and to curb the Pride of the Priests. Besides, he himself did wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly read the Books, that contained Controversies about Religion; and the Quietness and Retirement of his former Life, far remote from Court-Ambition, made many hope, that he would be sober and moderate in his Government. Besides, being out of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistracy, he had not yet discovered any Unactiveness or Sluggish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Mind.</p>

               </gap>inst this Peace, but, by disturbing some Members and Counsellors, and corrupting others, they would not suffer it so much as to be put to the Vote; so that, by the general consent of almost the whole Parliament, the Cardinal was confin'd to his Chamber till the Question was put; when he was removed out of the way, the Agreement was easily made as to the Queen's Marriage, and other Articles and Hostages were promised to <hi>Henry,</hi> to ratify the Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: The Cardinal, at the Instance of the Queen-Mother, was kept in a loose kind of Custody by <hi>Seton,</hi> who was persuaded, for a certain Sum of Mony, a while after, to let him go. When Peace seemed thus to be setled, to the great Advantage of both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, after so great a fear of an imminent War, every Body thought it would be a lasting One; and therefore the Merchants, who, for some Years before, had been hindred from trading, went thick and threefold to Sea, and laded very many Ships with the best Commodities they could procure, for the time al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:56771:264"/>
them so to do. <hi>Edinburgh</hi> sent out twelve Ships; other Cities of that Circuit (which is the richest part of <hi>Scotland</hi>) rigg'd out Ships, each according to their respective Abilities. This Fleet, in Confidence of the Peace with <hi>England,</hi> some of them drew nearer the Shores, than they needed to have done, and when the Wind was calm, there they lay at Anchor: Others entred into the Ports, open to the Injuries of the <hi>English,</hi> if any Tumult of War should arise.</p>
            <p>About the same time, <hi>Iohn Hamilton,</hi> Abbat of <hi>Pasley,</hi> and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid Painter,</hi> returned out of <hi>France.</hi> These Men now cast off the Vizard, wherewith before they had disguised themselves for many Years, and returned to their true Manners; for as if they had been educated not in the School of Piety, but of Profaneness, they were the Ring-leaders at Court, to all manner of Flagitiousness. The Cardinal being restor'd to his Liberty unexpectedly,<note place="margin">But is affron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal and his Faction, upon colourable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences.</note> being also of a proud Disposition, which was aggravated by the affront he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, and by the Ignominy accruing on the Detection of his Fraud, sought out all occasions whatsoever, to disturb this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord. First of all, he communicated the matter to the Queen <hi>Dowager</hi>; and they Both took it in great Indignation, That the <hi>Douglasses,</hi> (who, for the many Benefits they had received from the <hi>English,</hi> must needs be their fast Friends,) should immediately, after so many Years Banishment, be admitted into the Parliament-House, to debate the weightiest Affairs of the Kingdom. Besides, they all jointly feared a Change of the Establish'd Religion, the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent whereof must needs be a Breach of the League with <hi>France.</hi> Hereupon the Cardinal, by the consent of the Queen, summon'd a Convocation of Priests, and extorted from them a great Sum of Mony, as fearing the universal Ruin of the whole Papal Church. Part of this Mony was paid to some of the Nobles of the adverse Party, and many large Promises were made them besides, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade them not to give any Hostages to the <hi>English</hi>; and as for those, who were newly return'd from their Imprisonment, and had left their Children or Kindred, as Hostages for their Return, he desired them, not to prefer those (otherwise dear) Pledges before the Laws, the publick Safety, and their ancient Religion, whose Preservation was turn'd upon this Hinge alone; and that they would not run willingly into a perpetual Bondage. Besides, he caused the Ecclesiasticks to carry it proudly and disrespectfully to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>English</hi> Embassador, insomuch that the very Rabble did reproach and abuse his Retinue, and what he said, or did, was all taken in the worst Sense. But the Embassador resolv'd to bear all Affronts, and to tide it out, till the day, for delivering the Hostages, did approach, that so he might give no occasion of a Rupture on his part. And when that Day was come, he went to the Regent, and complained of the Affronts, which had been offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not so much to himself, as to his King, whom he represented, and how that the Law of Nations was violated thereby<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and moreover, he desired him to give Hostages according to the Tenor of the League newly made, that so the Amity might be kept sacred and inviolate, to the mutual Advantage of both Nations. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:56771:264"/>
as to the Affronts offered, excused himself, and said, he was sorry for them, and that he would speedily search into the matter, that so the Punishment of such petulant Offenders should be a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Testimony of the Love and Veneration he had for the <hi>English</hi> Nation. But as to Hostages, he answered, that he could not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them with the good Will of the States, neither was he able to compel them without publick consent. For the Government which he bore, was such, that he received as much Law as he gave, and therefore all his Measures were disturb'd by the great Sedition, which, he saw, the Cardinal had raised; that he was, as it were, carried down in the Stream of popular Fury, and could scarce maintain his own Station and Dignity. The new Hostages being thus deny'd, there was another thing as weighty as That, which fell under Debate, and that was, concerning the Nobles lately taken Prisoners of War, who, upon their Releasement, had given Hosta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and made solemn Asseverations, That, if there were not a Peace concluded, as <hi>Henry</hi> desired, upon just and fair Terms, they would surrender themselves Prisoners again. As for Them, the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal's Faction, and the rest of the Ecclesiastical Order, dealt with them, partly by Reasons, and partly by Examples, not to prefer their Estates, Kindred, Children, or any other thing, which might be dear to them, before the Love of their Country. And moreover he threatned them with Auxiliaries from <hi>France,</hi> and that all <hi>Europe</hi> did conspire for the Defence of their ancient Rites and Religion; and if they acted contrary, they would betray thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They also desired them in so dangerous a time, not to forsake their Country, for if That were safe, they might hope for more Kindred and Children, but if That were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown, then all was gone. Moreover, they discoursed much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the inexpiable Hatred betwixt the Nations, and of the Cruelty of the King, into whose Hands they were to come, thus blending Truths and Falshoods together.

               <hi>Matthew Stuart,</hi> Earl of <hi>Lennox,</hi> into his own Country, who did not only emulate the Family of the <hi>Hamiltons,</hi> but was also their deadly Enemie, being they had slain his Father at <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lithgoe.</hi> This young Man was greatly beloved, not only for his extraordinary Beauty and stately Garb in the very Flower of his Youth, but chiefly upon the account of the memory of his Father, who was so popular a Man, and also because he was a single Man, and the Extinction of such a noble Family, now reduced to a few, was in great Hazard; besides he had many Clanships at home, and had also Affinity with many other great Families. Furthermore, the former King had design'd him to be his next Heir and Successor, if he himself died without Issue Male; and he would have confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that his Intention by a Decree of the States, (who have the Sovereign Power to order such publick Affairs) if his Life had been prolonged. Yea, there were some Flatterers, which did elevate his generous Mind, already rais'd up with the expectation of great things, but not so well fortified against fraudulent Adulation, to larger Hopes; for, besides the Supreme Rule for about twenty Years, and the Domination over his old Enemies, they promised him, that he should marry the Queen Dowager; and if the young Queen, who had the Name only of Supreme Governess, should miscarry, then, without doubt, he would be the next King; and not only so, but also the lawful Heir of <hi>Iames Hamilton,</hi> lately deceased, seeing the Regent was a Bastard, and was so far from any just expectation of the Kingdom, that he could not lawfully claim the Inheritance of his own Family: Besides, they urged the Promises of the <hi>French</hi> King, who gave hopes of great Assistance, in due time. When the plain-hearted and credulous young Man was thus persuaded, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for his Voyage into <hi>Scotland. Hamilton</hi> was not ignorant of any of these things; and to the intent that he might gain an Acces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Strength to his own Party, by the Advice of those Friends whom he most trusted, he resolved to take away the young Queen from <hi>Linlithgo,</hi> where she yet was under the Power of her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for if he once got Her, then not only the Shadow of the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Name, which is an attractive thing amongst the Vulgar, would be of his Side, but also he should have the Power to bestow her in
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:56771:265"/>
Marriage, and so make himself Arbiter of the Kingdom, to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it whithersoever he pleased, which if he could obtain, then the King of <hi>England</hi> might be persuaded, if need were, to join with him.</p>
            <p>This Design was much approved; but, as is usual in Civil Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, there are Spies on both sides, who being informed thereof, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted the Cardinal therewith: He, gathering together some of the Nobility, whom he had corrupted with Mony, came to <hi>Linlithgo,</hi> and, to the great Burden of the Inhabitants, staid there some days, as a Guard to the Queen. In the mean time, <hi>Lennox</hi> arrived out of <hi>France,</hi> and was kindly received by the Regent, each of them dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling their Hate; then he went to <hi>Linlithgo</hi>; there he addres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the Cardinal, and then went to his own House, where, in a Meeting of Friends, he discours'd at large, Why he came over, at Whose Command, by Whom sent for, and upon What hopes; That he was promised, not only the chief Magistracy, but also that the Heads of the Faction, with the Queen Dowager's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, had assured him, that he should marry Her: And that, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the effecting thereof, the King of <hi>France</hi> had encouraged him to expect Aid and Assistance from thence: they all assented to his Speech, and advised him not to be wanting to the Occasion, which so freely had offer'd it self; and thus with above four thousand Men, he came to the Queen. <hi>Hamilton,</hi> who had levied and mustered his Men, and with his Kinsmen about him, was resolved to issue out of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and break thorow to the Queen, now perceiving that his Forces were too weak, by the Advice of his Friends, and out of his own Disposition also, which was inclinable to Peace, began to treat of an Accommodation: whereupon some prudent Persons were chosen on both sides, who met at the Town of <note n="*" place="margin">

               <hi>Liston,</hi> almost in the middle way between <hi>Edinburgh</hi> and <hi>Linlith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go:</hi> And an Agreement was made betwixt them on these Terms; That the Queen should be removed to <hi>Sterlin,</hi> and that Four of the prime Nobility, who had engaged themselves in neither Faction, should be chosen out to inspect her Education: And those were <hi>William Graham, Iohn Erskin, Iohn Lindsy,</hi> and <hi>William Leving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston,</hi> eminent Persons, and all Heads of illustrious Families. They, by the Consent of both Parties, took the Queen, and entred upon the Road leading to <hi>Sterlin,</hi> whilst <hi>Lennox</hi> stood in Arms with his Men, till they had travell'd far enough to be out of any Danger from the contrary Faction; and not long after, having performed the accustomed Ceremonies, she took on her the Ensigns of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, and began her Reign at <hi>Sterlin, August</hi> 21.</p>
            <p>The Regent, perceiving, that the Favour of the Vulgar, by reason of his Inconstancie, was alienated from him; and that his Forces were inferiour to those of the contrary Faction, began to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain private Conferences with them under-hand; and indeed the Cardinal, who was kin to him by the Mothers side, intended only to frighten him, that so he might bring him over to his party, rather than to subdue him by force of Arms: So that having weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him before, by taking off part of the Nobility from him, by his Largesses; and thereby rendred him cheaper, and of less Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute

amongst the <hi>English</hi>; he now, by the Intervention of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar Friends, who had more regard to Mony than Love to Truth, compell'd him to an unjust Combination, and persuading him to come to <hi>Sterlin,</hi>

And by this means, the Cardinal ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained without Envy, what he had coveted by his suborned Will, even to enjoy the advantage of the whole Government, and that by the mean-spiritedness of the Regent, and the Avarice of his Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. There seemed but one thing wanting to establish his Power, and that was the Removal of <hi>Lennox,</hi> who was a great Block in the way of his Designs; At last, the Queen Dowager and Cardinal fixed upon this Project, That, till an Answer came from <hi>France,</hi> she should hold the young Man's Mind in Suspence, giving him some hopes of marrying her.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lennox</hi> was promised to marry the Queen, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by her and the Cardinal.</note> For they had written honourably of <hi>Len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nox</hi> to the French King, as indeed they could do no other; for, next to God, they were indebted to him for restoring them to the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty they enjoyed; but withal they desired him, that seeing Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were now quieted in <hi>Scotland,</hi> by that King's Liberality and As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance, that he would be pleased to maintain the Courtesy he had done them, and to confirm the Peace which he had afforded, by calling <hi>Lennox</hi> back again. For, without that, things would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver long continue in Peace, but one or other of the Factions must be destroyed. Thus they undermined <hi>Lennox</hi> privately; but in publick he was entertained with various Divertisements by the Queen and Cardinal, insomuch that the Court loosed the Reins to Luxury and Lasciviousness, and was wholly given up to Plays and Feastings. The Day was spent in Tiltings, and such kind of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Exercises; the Night in Balls and Dancing. <hi>Lennox</hi> was incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, by Nature, to these Recreations, and was, besides, much ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed to them in the <hi>French</hi> Court. But now <hi>Iames Hepburn,</hi> Earl of <hi>Bothwel,</hi> started up as his Rival, and somewhat spurr'd up his Mind, almost ready to languish. This <hi>Iames</hi> was banished by King <hi>Iames</hi> the Fifth, but presently after his Death, he return'd home, and aspired to the Marriage of the Queen, by the same Arts, as <hi>Lennox</hi> did; and indeed the Indowments of Nature and Fortune were very eminent in Both of them, insomuch that they might be said to be rather Like than Equal. <hi>Bothwel</hi> matched him in other things; but in these <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>udicrous Combats and Feats of Arms, being inferiour to him, he left the Court, and departed to his own House. <hi>Lennox,</hi> when his Rival was removed, thought now, that all was secure on his part, and thereupon he earnestly press'd, that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises made him by the Queen and Cardinal, might be performed: But perceiving at last, that he was fraudulently dealt with, and that <hi>Hamilton,</hi> his Enemy, was advanc'd by them to Honour, Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:56771:266"/>
and the Supreme Power over all Mens Lives and Fortunes, his youthful Mind, which was not accustomed to ill Arts, but judg'd all others like himself, was so inflamed with Anger, that he brake forth into bitter Expressions, and solemnly swore, that he would suffer Want, Banishment, Death, yea any thing whatsoever, than such an Affront to go unrevenged. Hereupon he retired to <hi>Dunbarton,</hi> wholly bent on Revenge, but, as yet, uncertain what Course to take to accomplish it; there he received 30000 French Crowns from the King of <hi>France,</hi> (who had not <hi>yet</hi> certainly heard, how Affairs stood in <hi>Scotland</hi>) to enable him to strengthen his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; That Mony did somewhat relieve his diseased Mind, because it gave him hope that he was not wholly forsaken by the French King. But, being commanded to distribute the Mony by the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Queen Dowager and the Cardinal, yet he distributed part of it to his own Friends, and part he sent to the Queen. The Cardinal, who had already devoured all that Prey in his Hope, was grievously troubled not only at his Disappointment and Loss, but also at his (supposed) Disgrace therein, and therefore he advised the Regent presently to levy an Army, and to march to <hi>Glasgow,</hi> not doubting, but that he might there surprise <hi>Lennox</hi> and the Mony to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Their Design was made known to <hi>Lennox,</hi> and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he speedily levied 10000 Men, and above,<note place="margin">Upon which he retires, and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses up in Arms, and from <hi>Glas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cow</hi> marches to <hi>Leith</hi>;</note> all of his Friends and Vassals. That which much facilitated the compleating that Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, was, the Indignation of some of the Nobles, who, at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, out of Love to Religion, and Hatred of the Cardinal, had been the Instruments to advance the Regent to that high Honour; but now they had chang'd their former Good-will into Hatred, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he had delivered up, and, as much as in him lay, betrayed his best-deserving Friends, with himself, into the Servitude of their most cruel Enemy, without so much as giving them any notice thereof.</p>
            <p>This Frame of Spirit made a new, and scarce credible, Change in the <hi>Scotish</hi> Affairs; so that the Strength of the Parties being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, only they were headed by other Commanders. <hi>Hamilton</hi> and his Kin joined themselves to the Queen Dowager and the Cardinal; but his former Friends sided with <hi>Lennox:</hi> With those Forces levied on a sudden, <hi>Lennox</hi> came to <hi>Leith,</hi> and sent some into <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> to tell the Cardinal, That he needed not to march to <hi>Glasgow</hi> to fight him, for he would give him opportunity so to do, any Day when he pleas'd, in the Fields between <hi>Leith</hi> and <hi>Edinburgh</hi>; The Cardinal, who had drawn the Regent to his Party, imagined, that the Power of the adverse Party was so weakned thereby, that he hoped none durst look him in the Face; now, unexpectedly, seeing himself challenged by a greater Army than he had to defend him, in words did not refuse the Combate, but only deferr'd the Day of Fight upon several Pretences and Interposals; well knowing, that <hi>Lennox</hi> could not long keep an Army together, consisting of Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers, without Pay or Provision made for any long time; in the mean time, he endeavoured by Intreaties and Promises, to work over the Minds of those, who were most inclinable, to his Party. <hi>Lennox,</hi> seeing that the Design was to lengthen out the War, and
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:56771:267"/>
by no means to hazard a Fight; and being in no posture to begin a Siege, for want of Conveniencies necessary thereto; and also per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, that some of his Men had secret Conferences, by Night, with the Enemy: To deliver himself out of these Straits, (his Friends, who had made secret Provision for themselves, urging him also thereunto) was forced to capitulate with the Regent.<note place="margin">But was forc'd to capitulate with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.</note> And thereupon he went to <hi>Edinburgh</hi> to him, and they transacted Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters some Days together, as if they had forgot their old Hatred and Animosity.</p>
            <p>At length, when he came to <hi>Linlithgo, Lennox</hi> was advised by his Friends, that some hidden Mischief was brewing against him; so that, in the Night-time, he went privily to <hi>Glasgow,</hi> and having fortified the Bishop's Castle with a Garison, and Sufficiency of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions, he went to <hi>Dunbarton</hi>; there he received more certain In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, That the <hi>Douglasses</hi> and the <hi>Hamiltons</hi> were agreed. And because some Suspicions and Relicks of old Grudges were left betwixt the Factions; <hi>George Douglas</hi> and <hi>Alexander Cuningham</hi> were given as Hostages, the one for the Father, the other for the Brother, though this was done for a pretence and disguise of a fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Concord, and a Promise made, that they should speedily be released, yet notwithstanding they were detain'd till the coming in of the <hi>English</hi> Army. For the <hi>Hamiltons</hi> never thought themselves secure, until those Nobles, who had any Interest or Courage, were removed; that so, by the Terror of their Punishment, others might be restrained from Risings. Besides, about the same time, <hi>Lennox</hi> was informed, that the King of <hi>France</hi> was alienated from him, by the malicious Practices of his Enemies.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, <hi>Archibald Douglas</hi> Earl of <hi>Angus,</hi> and <hi>Robert Maxwel,</hi> Chief of a noble Family, came to <hi>Glasgow,</hi> to accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date Matters (if it were possible) between the <hi>Regent</hi> and <hi>Lennox</hi>; But the Regent's Council persuaded him, to apprehend the very Mediators for Peace; and thus, by a back-way, to avoid the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult of the People, they were carried out, and sent Prisoners to <hi>Hamilton</hi> Castle.</p>
            <p>In this posture of Affairs in <hi>Scotland,</hi> when not only the <hi>English,</hi> but the Chief of the <hi>Scots</hi> also, were angry with the Regent; <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>England</hi> thought it a fit opportunity for him,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> makes War upon <hi>Scotland,</hi>
               </note> to punish the Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators, not only of the League, but of the Law of Nations too; yet, before he would attack the <hi>Scots</hi> by force, he sent Letters, full of just Complaints and Threats, to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> blaming them for refusing his Alliance, which he had so freely and generously offer'd, so arrogantly as they did; yea, that they had not only rejected that Alliance, but, though he had been kind to them, they scattered the Seeds of War, and had enforc'd him to arm against his Will. These Letters did no good, whereupon he caused those Naval Forces, which he had ready, with the first opportunity, to waft over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Boulognois,</hi> to set Sail for <hi>Scotland,</hi> and to infest <hi>Edinburgh</hi> and <hi>Leith,</hi> (both which Towns had most affronted his Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors) and the Country round about them, with the Miseries of War. The Ships, arriving there, landed ten thousand Foot, <hi>May</hi> the 4<hi>th,</hi> a little above <hi>Leith,</hi> who, without any Resistance, enter
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:56771:267"/>
the Town; for most of the Towns-men were absent, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Merchandizing. The King and Cardinal, being then at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and unprovided of all things, knew not what to do, but were so surprized, that they presently set at Liberty those four eminent Persons, which they had in durance, (as aforesaid) not for any regard to the publick Safety, but partly fearing, lest other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise their Kinsmen and Tenants should refuse to fight, if not join themselves to the Enemy; and partly also, that they might redeem the Good-will of the People, who, they knew, were alienated from them, upon many accounts; but they, not daring to commit themselves to the Hatred of the Citizens, and of their Enemies too, fled to <hi>Linlithgo.</hi> The <hi>English</hi> staid three days at <hi>Leith</hi> to land their Ordnance and Baggage, and so prepar'd themselves for the Encounter. Having setled other matters, they march to <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> pillag'd and burnt the City, and then disperst themselves to spoil the neighbouring Parts, they ruin'd many Villages,<note place="margin">Burns <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> &amp;c. and retreats.</note> with some Castles and Seats of Noblemen. From <hi>Edinburgh</hi> they return'd to <hi>Leith,</hi> and having a fair Wind, set fire to the Houses, and hoist Sail, and away.</p>
            <p>About that Time, <hi>Lennox</hi> was certainly inform'd, That <hi>Francis,</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> was wholly alienated from him. For the contrary Faction, by their frequent Letters and Messages, had persuaded him, That 'twas <hi>Lennox</hi> alone, who, by reason of his old Enmity against his Fathers Enemies, did hinder the publick Concord of all <hi>Scotland</hi>; and that he was the Head of the Faction against the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, and a Favourer of the <hi>English,</hi> and one who did rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge his own private Animosities,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lennox</hi> la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy himself to the <hi>French</hi> King, against the Calumnies of the Queen and Cardinal.</note> than promote the common Cause; and that if the King would recal him into <hi>France,</hi> Peace would easily be made up amongst the rest. When <hi>Lennox</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Intelligence, by his Friends, what his Enemies had inform'd against him, he also writ to <hi>Francis,</hi> informing him, in what case he found the Affairs of <hi>Scotland</hi>; and how he, and his Friends, had, with a great deal of pains, vindicated both Queens to their Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and had put them into a posture and capacity to rule, having broken the Power of the adverse Party; and, out of a turbulent Tempest, had brought things to a great Tranquillity, and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing would be more acceptable to him, than to return into <hi>France,</hi> where he had lived well nigh longer than in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and so to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the sweet Society of his beloved Friends: But that he returned into his own Country, not of his own accord, but sent by the King, and that he had done nothing there, whereof his Majesty or himself need to be ashamed; and, if he would not abridge him of his former Favour, he would shortly answer, yea, perhaps, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, the hope he had conceived of him; but, if he should call him away, in the midst of the carreer of his Designs, then he must not only leave the Things, he had so excellently began, unfinish'd, but also expose his Friends, Kindred, and Vassals, whom he had enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in the publick Cause, and who had been almost worn out with toil and labour, to Servitude and Torment, under an impious and cruel Tyrant; who, as much as in him was, had sold both Queen and Kingdom to the Enemy; and, who observed the Pacts and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:56771:268"/>
he made to Men, no more religiously than he did the Duties of Piety towards God; for, within a few Years, he had changed his Religion Three times: neither was it to be wonder'd at in him, who looked upon Oaths and Promises, not as Bonds obliging to Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, but as lurking holes to hide Perfidiousness. And therefore, he moved earnestly, That the King, and those of his Council, would consider, whether, in so great an Affair, They would believe him, all whose Ancestors had devoted themselves, their Lives, Honours and Fortunes, for the increase of his Greatness; and who, indeed, had been honoured and rewarded by him with many Benefits, which yet were rather Testimonies of their good Acceptance, than just Rewards and Compensations of their Labours; or else a Man, who would change his Friends and Foes, at the blast of every Wind, and who depended on the Arbitrement of Fortune alone.</p>
            <p>Though many were not ignorant, that his Allegations were true, yet the <hi>French</hi> King was so influenc'd by the <hi>Guise</hi>'s, the Queen Dowager's Father and Unkle; and, who, in all things, endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to promote her Concerns, that his Heart and Ear were both shut against <hi>Lennox</hi>'s Request, insomuch, that he would not permit <hi>Iohn Cambel,</hi> a Man of approved Virtue, sent by <hi>Lennox,</hi> to have Audience, or, so much as to come into his Presence, but kept him in the nature of a Prisoner, and had Spies set upon him to watch him, that so he might not write back any thing of the Designs agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated in the <hi>French</hi> Court; yet notwithstanding this their Caution, there were some who told him all. When <hi>Lennox</hi> heard this, by the Dispatches which were sent him, his troubled Mind was vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously hurried betwixt Anger and Shame; he was ashamed to leave his Enterprize which he had begun, unfinished; and the rather, because, he thought, that he was not able to satisfy the Love of his Friends and Kindred, whom he had drawn, with him, into the same Danger, but by the Sacrifice of his Life. As for the rest, his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger was highly inflamed, especially against the Queen-Dowager and the Cardinal, by whose perfidious Contumely, he was cast into these Straits; but, he was chiefly offended with the King of <hi>France,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining, that he had brought him upon the Stage, and now in the midst of his Acting, had forsaken him, and joined himself with his Enemies. Whilst his Thoughts thus fluctuated, not knowing where to fix, News was brought him, That all the Inhabitants on this side Mount <note n="*" place="margin">Or, <hi>Grampius.</hi>

            <p>In the mean time, <hi>Lennox,</hi> being forsaken by the <hi>French</hi> King, and also cut off from any hope of other Aid, made trial, by his
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:56771:268"/>
Friends, how the King of <hi>England</hi> stood affected towards him; and finding it fair Weather there, he resolv'd for <hi>England</hi>: but, before he went, he had a great Mind to perform some notable Exploit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Hamiltons</hi>; and, communicating his Design to <hi>William Cuningham,</hi> Earl of <hi>Glencarn,</hi> They two, at a Day appointed, with their Tenants and Adherents, resolved to meet at <hi>Glasgow,</hi> and from thence to make an inroad into the County of <hi>Clydsdale,</hi> which, almost all, belonged to the <hi>Hamiltons.</hi> When the Regent heard of this, he resolved to be before-hand with them, and so to seize upon <hi>Glasgow,</hi> and thereby prevent the place of meeting; but <hi>Cuningham,</hi> with a great Party of his Men, were entered the Town before, and there expected the coming of <hi>Lennox</hi>; but, hearing of <hi>Hamilton</hi>'s coming, and of his Design, he drew out his Men into the Fields adjoining, and according to the number of those he had, set them in array, there were about 800 of them, part of his own Clanship, and part of the Citizens of <hi>Glasgow,</hi> which favoured his Cause; and thus, with greater Courage than Force, he joined Battel and fought so valiantly, that he beat the first Rank of the Enemy back upon the second; and took the Brass-pieces they had brought with them. But whilst the Fight was hot about the Regent's Quarter,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lennox</hi> and <hi>Cuningham</hi> worsted by <hi>Hamilton.</hi>
               </note> and the Matter was in great Hazard there, on a sudden, <hi>Robert Boyd,</hi> a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant and brave Man, came in with a small Party of Horse, and thrust himself into the midst of the Fight, where the hottest Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice was: He occasioned a greater Fear and Trepidation, than so small a number need to have done; for both Armies believed, that great Assistance was come into the <hi>Hamiltons.</hi> This Mistake quite changed the fortune of the Day, whilst one thought the assistance was come into his Party, the other to his Enemies. There were slain, in the Battel, about 300 on both sides; the greatest part was of the <hi>Cunningham</hi>'s, and amongst them two Sons of the Earl's, gallant Men, both: Neither was the Victory unbloody to the <hi>Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons,</hi> for they lost considerable Persons on their side too. But the greatest Mischief fell upon the Inhabitants of <hi>Glasgow,</hi> for the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, not contented with the Blood of the Towns-men which they had killed, nor with the Miseries of those, who survived; nor yet with the Plunder of their Houses, they also took away the Valves and Shutters of their Gates and Windows, and their Iron-Bars; neither did they forbear any kind of Calamity, but only the firing of their Houses, which were so torn and deformed before. The Event of this Battel wrought a great change in Mens Minds, so that <hi>Lennox</hi>'s Friends and Kinsmen refused to commit the Matter to the Hazard of a second Encounter; not so much, because their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies Force was increased, and theirs lessened; nor that, because, having lost so many valiant Men, they could not speedily gather to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether a new supply from places so remote; as, that they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to give any new Provocation to <hi>Hamilton,</hi> or, by too much Obstinacy, to offend him, under whose Government, they knew, they must shortly come.</p>

<pb n="86" facs="tcp:56771:269"/>
               <hi>England,</hi> against the advice of his best Friends, who were willing, he should have stayed some Months, in that impregnable Castle, and so waited for a change of Affairs, which, they did not doubt, but shortly would come to pass. But he was resolved for <hi>England,</hi> where he was honourably received by the King, who, besides his other Respects, gave him <hi>Margaret Douglas</hi> in Marriage; she was Sister to <hi>Iames,</hi> last King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> begot by the Earl of <hi>Angus,</hi> upon the Sister of <hi>Henry</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> a Lady in the Flower of her Age, of great Comeliness and Beauty. In the mean time, the Queen-Dowager received into her Protection That <hi>Scotish</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which, by the Departure of <hi>Lennox,</hi> was left without an Head, and which did obstinately refuse to come under the Power of <hi>Hamilton,</hi> (whose Levity they knew before, and now feared his Cruelty) for she was afraid, that they might be inrag'd in such an hurry of Things, and so desperately ingage in some new Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Hamiltons</hi> were glad at the departure of so potent an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, but yet not satisfied with the Punishments already inflicted, they used their Prosperity very intemperately: For, in the next Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention held at <hi>Linlithgo,</hi> they condemned him, and his Friends; confiscated their Goods, and banished them the Land. A great Sum of Money was raised out of the Fines of those, who redeemed their Estates out of the Exchequer, but not without great Disgust, and the high Offence of all good Men. In the midst of these Domestick Seditions,<note place="margin">The <hi>English</hi> enter <hi>Scotland</hi> with an Army, and garison <hi>Coldingham.</hi>
               </note> The <hi>English</hi> entred <hi>Scotland,</hi> and committed great Spoil and Desolation on <hi>Iedburgh, Kelso,</hi> and the Country thereabout; from thence they went to <hi>Coldingham,</hi> where they fortified the Church and the Tower, as well as they could for the time, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Works and leaving a Garison, and so departed: And the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison-Souldiers made great havock in all the adjacent parts; partly, out of a greediness for Plunder; and partly, that the Country thereabouts might not afford Provisions to the Enemy, when they besieged them. Hereupon, they, who ruled the Roast in <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Queen-Dowager, Cardinal, and Regent, by the advice of the Council, sent forth a Proclamation, That the Nobles, and the most discreet and ablest of the Commons,<note place="margin">The Regent raises an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treats shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.</note> should come in armed, with eight Days Provision, to march whither the Regent led them. In a short time, about 8000 met together, and in a very sharp Winter too, who, having battered the Tower of the Church of <hi>Coldingham</hi> with their great Guns, stood in their Arms all that Day and Night, to the great wearying of Horse and Man. The Day after, the Regent, either out of Tenderness and Inability to indure Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Toil, or fearing the Invasion of the Enemy, (for he was infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med from <hi>Berwick,</hi> a Neighbour-Town, that the <hi>English</hi> were upon their March) unknown to his Nobles, and with but a few in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, mounted on Horse back, and with full speed fled back to <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar.</hi> They, who endeavour to excuse the baseness of this Flight, say, that he was afraid, lest his Army (out of Hate preconceived on many former Accounts) would have given him up to the <hi>English.</hi> His Departure made a great Disturbance in the whole Army, and the rather, because the Cause of his Flight was unknown, and
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:56771:269"/>
therefore many thought, that 'twas the more considerable, and that they had greater Reason to fear. Hereupon some were obstinately resolved to run home, the nearest way they could, and leave their Guns behind them; Others, who would seem a little more provident and stout, were for overcharging them, that so they might break in pieces at a Discharge, and become useless to the Enemy. But <hi>Archibald</hi> Earl of <hi>Angus</hi> withstood them all, telling them, that they should not add so foul an Offence to their base Flight; but not being able to retain them, either by his Authority or Entreaty, he burst out into these Words, with a loud Voice, so that many might hear him: <hi>As for me,</hi> said he, <hi>I had rather chuse a noble Death, than to enjoy my Life, tho opulent and secure, after the admission of so foul a Fact: You, my Friends and Fellow-Soldiers, consider what you will do; as for me, I will bring back these Guns, or else I will never return back hence alive, my Honour and my Life shall go together.</hi> This Speech affected some Few, whose Honour was dearer to them than their Lives, but the rest was so disheartened by the shameful Flight of the Regent, that they broke their Ranks, and went every one scatteringly home. <hi>Douglas</hi> sent the Guns before, and he, with his Party, followed in good Order in the Rear, and tho he was prest upon by the <hi>English</hi> Horse, (whom the Tumult had excited) yet he brought the Ordnance safe to <hi>Dunbar.</hi> This Expedition, rashly undertaken, and as basely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, discouraged abundance of the <hi>Scots,</hi> and raised up the <hi>English</hi> to an intolerable height; as drawing the Cowardise of the Regent to Their Praise. And therefore <hi>Ralph Evers</hi> and <hi>Brian Laiton,</hi> two brave English Cavaleers, overran all <hi>Merce, Teviot,</hi> and <hi>Lauderdale,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The vain boast of <hi>Evers</hi> and <hi>Laiton,</hi> two <hi>English</hi> Cavaleers.</note> without any Resistance, and made the Inhabitants of those Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries submit themselves, and if any were refractory, they wasted their Lands, and made their Habitations desolate; yea, the undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbed course of their Victories made them so resolute and insolent, that they propounded the Bay of <hi>Forth</hi> to be the Boundary of their Conquest. And with this hope they went to <hi>London,</hi> and crav'd a Reward from <hi>Henry</hi> for their good Service: Their Petition was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the Council; and in debate thereof, <hi>Thomas Howard</hi> Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> who had made many Expeditions against the <hi>Scots,</hi> and had done them much Mischief, understanding, that, in that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesom Posture of Affairs in <hi>Scotland,</hi> it was no hard Matter to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run naked and unguarded Countries, and to compel the Commonalty, when they had no other Refuge, to take an Oath of Fealty to them; and withal knowing the constancy of the <hi>Scots,</hi> in maintaining their Country, and their Resolution in recovering it, when lost; upon these Considerations, 'tis reported, that he advised the King, to give them all the Land, which they could win by the Sword, and also to allow them a small Force to defend it, till the <hi>Scots</hi> therein were inured to the <hi>English</hi> Government. This Gift they willingly receiv'd, and the King as willingly gave, upon which, their vain boasting being as vainly requited, they return'd joyfully to the Borders, having obtain'd 3000 Souldiers in pay, besides the Border<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who are wont to serve without any Military Stipend. Their return mightily disturb'd all the Borderers, because they had no hopes of any help from the Regent, in regard he was influenc'd in all
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:56771:270"/>
his Counsels by a Priest, especially by the Cardinal. Hereupon, <hi>Archibald</hi> Earl of <hi>Angus</hi> being much affected with the Publick dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace,<note place="margin">The Regent, by the advice of <hi>Angus,</hi> raises a party to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,</hi>
               </note> and also concerned upon the Account of his own private Losses, (for he had large and fruitful Possessions in <hi>Merch</hi> and <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viotdale</hi>) sent to the Regent to prevent it. The Regent deplor'd his own solitude, and complain'd, how he was deserted by the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility. <hi>Douglas</hi> told him, it was his own, not the Nobilities fault, for they were willing to spend their Lives and Fortunes for the good of the Publick, but he had slighted their Advice, and was wholly govern'd by a few sorry Priests, who were Cowardly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad and Seditious at home, for they, being exempted from dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger themselves, did abusively spend the Fruits of other Mens Labours on their own Pleasures. This (said he) is the Fountain, from whence Suspicions arise betwixt you and the Nobles, which, in regard you cannot trust one another, is a great hindrance to the publick Service. But if you will communicate Counsels with them, who will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to spend their Lives in executing what shall be resolved upon, I do not despair, but we may yet perform as noble Exploits as any of our Ancestors did, in Times equally, or, at least, not much less troublesome, than the Days we now live in. But if, by our own Slothfulness, we suffer the Enemy to conquer by piece-meal, he will quickly force us to a Surrender or a Banishment, and which of the Two is more miserable and flagitious can hardly be determined. As for us Two, I know, that I am accused by my Enemies of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery, and You of Cowardise. But if you would do that speedily, which you are not able to avoid, 'tis not a fine-spun Oration, but the Field and Dint of Sword, shall wipe off both these Criminations. The Regent told him, that he would be wholly guided by him and the Nobles, whereupon a Council was summoned about an Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and by their advice a Proclamation was set forth to all the Neighbouring-Countries; That all the Nobility therein should, with all the speed they could, repair to the Regent wheresoever he should be; and they the Day after, with their present Force, which were not above 300 Horse, march'd for <hi>England.</hi> There came into them some of the <hi>Lothianers</hi> and <hi>Merch-men,</hi> but not very many, so that when they came to <hi>Mulross,</hi> upon <hi>Tweed,</hi> they resolv'd to stay there, till more Force came up to them; but the English, who were already come as far as <hi>Iedburgh,</hi> being inform'd by their Spies of the Paucity of the Enemy, march'd with about 5000 Men out of <hi>Ied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> directly towards <hi>Mulross,</hi> not doubting, but that they should surprize the Regent, and his Party unawares, being but few, and they also tyred with their March.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Scots,</hi> being informed by their Scouts of the coming of the <hi>English,</hi> withdrew themselves unto the next Hills, from thence, in Safety, to behold what Course the Enemy would take. The <hi>English,</hi> being thus disappointed of their hope, wander'd up and down in the Town and Monastery of Monks, which were pillag'd a little before, being intent upon what prey they could find, and there they staid, until break of day. Assoon as 'twas light, they were returning to <hi>Iedburgh,</hi> and the <hi>Scots,</hi> having receiv'd a supply of almost 300 of the Blades of <hi>Fife,</hi> under the Command of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:56771:270"/>
Lesly,</hi> Son to the Earl of <hi>Rothes,</hi> (a young Man, for all Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishments hardly to be match'd again in <hi>Scotland</hi>) grew there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by more incouraged, and so with a slow March, they retired to the Hills, which are about the Town of <hi>Ancram</hi>: There Walter <hi>Scot,</hi>
               <note place="margin">In <hi>Teviotdale</hi>:</note> (of whom mention is made before,) an active and prudent Person came in to them with but a few in his Company, excusing the Straitness of time, and telling them, that his whole Party would be speedily with them: His advice was, that they should send their Horse unto the next Hill, and so all of them run equal Hazard on foot, and wait for the Enemy on the low ground, for he did not doubt, but that their Servants, carrying up their Horse to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ground, would make the <hi>English</hi> believe, that they were running away, and that would occasion them to hasten their March. And accordingly, lest the <hi>Scots</hi> should get off without fighting, and be again to be sought out with a great deal of Pains; before the Night came, the <hi>English</hi> march'd up to them in three Battalions; for they <note n="*" place="margin">The <hi>English,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing overconfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, are worsted, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally by th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </note> hoped to end the Business with one light Skirmish, and because their hopes were such, each one exhorted his Fellow to make haste, though they had continued their March Night and Day before, under their heavy Arms, that so by a short Toil they might get long Rest, Renown and Glory; These Exhortations ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to their Courage, as much as the Toil of the March abated their Strength, so that their two first Battalions fell in amongst the <hi>Scots,</hi> who were prepared for the Onset, as into an Ambush, yet trusting to their number, they stood to their Arms and fought stout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. But two things (wisely foreseen) were a great help to the <hi>Scots,</hi> for both the Sun was almost at West, and darted with his full Beams in the Faces of the Enemy; and also the Wind, which was somewhat high, carried back the Smoke of the Gunpowder upon the Battalions behind, insomuch that they could not see their way; and besides, whilst they were panting, by reason of their March, it mightily troubled them with its noisom Smell: The first Battalion of the <hi>English</hi> fell back upon the second, the second on the third, where, by their Intermixtures one with another, and the pressing of the <hi>Scots</hi> upon them, they all brake their Ranks and were driven back, so that all were so full of Fear and Terror; that none knew his own Colours, or his Captain; thus whilst every one provided for his own Safety, no Man remembred the publick Danger and Disgrace. The <hi>Scots</hi> followed thick after them, so that now there was no more fighting, but slaying. At Night the <hi>Scots</hi> were called back to their Colours, and taking a View of the slain, they lost only two of their own; of the <hi>English,</hi> besides Commanders, there dyed about 200 Souldiers, and amongst them some of Note, there were about a thousand Prisoners taken, and of them above 80 Gentlemen. This Victory, happening beyond all Men's Expectation, was so much the more acceptable; the Fruit of all redounded to the Regent, but almost all the Honour to the <hi>Douglasses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About this time, by the Fraud, as 'tis thought of <hi>George Gordon</hi> Earl of <hi>Huntly,</hi> a Contention arose, in which almost all the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note n="*" place="margin">The Family of the <hi>Frasers</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most like to be quite extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish'd.</note> of the <hi>Frasers</hi> were extinguish'd. There was betwixt Them,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:56771:271"/>
and <hi>Mac Rainald</hi> an old Grudg, which had been often manifested to the loss of both Parties; and <hi>Huntly</hi> was inwardly fill'd with Indignation, that they alone, of all the Neighbouring Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, refused to come under his Clanship. For when the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Islanders gather'd together what strength they could, against the Earl of <hi>Argile,</hi> there was hardly any Man in all that Tract of the Country, but bore Arms on one side or other. But the matter being composed without Blows, as they were returning, sever'd from him another way, the <hi>Mac-Rainalds</hi> having notice of it, got their Clanships together, and set upon them most furiously, and the <hi>Frasers</hi> being fewer in number were overcome, and all slain to a Man. And thus that numerous Family, which had oft so well deserved of their Country, had been wholly extinguish'd, unless, by God's good Providence, (as we have reason to believe) 80 of the chief of the Family, had left their Wives at home great with Child, all of which in due time brought forth Male-Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and they all lived to Man's Estate.</p>
            <p>At the same time, the King of <hi>England</hi> heard, that his Army was beaten and wasted in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and that an Embassador was sent by the Regent to the King of <hi>France,</hi> to acquaint him with the Victory, and to desire Aid of him, against the Demands and Threats of the King of <hi>England,</hi> and likewise to inform against <hi>Lennox,</hi> in Defamation of his Departure into <hi>England</hi>; as for Aid, he could scarce obtain any, because the <note n="â€ " place="margin">The <hi>French</hi> assists the <hi>Scots</hi> with some small Force.</note> 
               <hi>French</hi> knew for certain, that <hi>Henry</hi> was about passing over with great Forces into <hi>France,</hi> only they sent 500 Horse, and 3000 Foot, not so much to defend the <hi>Scots</hi> from the Incursions of the <hi>English,</hi> as to hold them in play, that they might not fall with their whole Strength upon <hi>France. Henry,</hi> that Summer, did not think it fit, to send greater Forces to the Borders of <hi>Scotland,</hi> because he was of opinion, that the Garisons there were sufficient to inhibit the Excursions of the <hi>Scots</hi>; and besides, he knew well enough, that the <hi>Scots,</hi> in such a perplexed State of their affairs, could not raise a great Army that Year, to attack any well-fortified places.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Scotish</hi> Embassador in <hi>France</hi> objected some sorry matters against <hi>Lennox,</hi> in his Absence, scarce worth the answering, as, that he had concealed the Mony sent to him; that by reason of his Dissensions with the Cardinal, the cause of the Publick was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd; and as for his Departure into <hi>England,</hi> That he exaggerated, most invidiously. The King of <hi>France,</hi> who, by means of false Rumors, had conceiv'd such an Anger against <hi>Lennox,</hi> that he would by no means admit of any Compurgation or Apology against those Calumnies, and who also had imprisoned <hi>Lennox</hi>'s Brother, unheard, Captain of his Guards, when the Truth began a little to appear, as 'twere in excuse for his temerarious Fault, sought for some colour to hide it, and commanded an Examination to be made of the Crimes objected against <hi>Lennox.</hi> And the Enquiry was committed to <hi>Iames Montgomery</hi> of <hi>Lorge,</hi> Commander of the <hi>French</hi> Auxiliaries, a Man active and good enough, but a bitter E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy to <hi>Lennox</hi>; 'twas put into his Hands by the Procurement of the <hi>Guises,</hi> because they were not able to separate the cause of their

This they continued during ten Days, never going further into the Enemies Country in the Day-time, than they could return back to their Camp at Night. In the Interim, <hi>Montgomery</hi> and <hi>George Hume</hi> dealt earnestly with the Regent, that he would remove his Camp to the other side of the <hi>Tweed,</hi> that so they might make freer Inrodes upon the parts adjacent, and spred the terrour of their Army to a greater Distance, but their Solicitations were in vain. For the Regent, and those of the Council about him, were against it, because they were destitute of all Necessaries for storming of Castles; so that they disbanded the Army, and returned home. The other took up their Winter-Quarters,<note place="margin">But again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat.</note> as every one thought fit, but <hi>Montgomery</hi> went to <hi>Sterlin</hi> to the Court, where knowing of the Calumnies raised against <hi>Len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nox</hi> by his Enemies, though he himself did highly disgust him too, yet he grievously rebuked the Cardinal, that, without any considerable Provocation on <hi>Lennox</hi>'s part, he had loden so noble and innocent a Person with such calumnious Imputations, and had compell'd him, even against his Will, to join himself with the Enemy.</p>
            <p>About the same time, Inroads were made on both sides, on all parts of the Borders with various Events. <hi>Robert Maxwel</hi> the Son of <hi>Robert,</hi> a young Man of singular Valor, was taken Prisoner by the <hi>English</hi>; there was nothing memorable done besides. At the beginning of the following Winter, <hi>Montgomery</hi> return'd to <hi>France,</hi> and the Cardinal carried about the Regent with him through the Neighbouring Provinces, upon pretence to reconcile and heal the Seditions and Distempers of all Parties.

His Design was, to assault the City in two places, <hi>Grey,</hi> who had taken the whole matter on himself, attack'd it from the Bridg over the River <hi>Tay:</hi> The other Party were to carry their Guns up the Stream, and so to storm the open side of the Town; but because the Tide hindred them, they came not up in time: <hi>Grey</hi> makes his Attempt from the Bridg (from which <hi>Ruven</hi> had purposely withdrawn his Guards into the next Houses, that so it might seem to the Enemy, as if it were undefended,) and when he saw none in Arms to oppose him, he boldly march'd up into the Body of the Town; whereupon <hi>Ruven</hi> issued out of the adjoining Houses on a sudden, and gave him a brisk charge, which routed him and his whole party; but, in their Flight through narrow Passages, the one hindred another; for the last, striving to gain the Mouth of the Passage, gave a stop to the first: and in this confusion many were trod under-foot, and sixty fell by the Sword. The Cardinal, when he knew that <hi>Ruven</hi> had got the Victory, was somewhat sorry for it; yet, glad withal, that so many of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies were destroyed; for, seeing he despaired ever to make them his Friends, he counted it a Gain to him, to see them mutually to

The Cardinal, having thus past over as much of <hi>Angus,</hi> as he thought convenient at that time, brought the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, after the Winter-Solstice to St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> to indear his Mind more unto him, if 'twere possible; for, though he had his Son, the Earl of <hi>Arran,</hi> as a Pledg, yet as often as he bent his Thoughts to the Consideration of the Fierceness of the <hi>Scotish</hi> Nobility, to the Strength of the opposite Faction, and to the Inconstancy of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, he was afraid, that he might be persuaded by his Enemies, and so wrought over to them with the same Levity, as he had first joined himself with him: There he entertained him, with a small Retinue, with Sports and Pastimes twenty days at <hi>Christmas</hi>; he gave him many Gifts at present, and promised him more for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and after much Discourse together, concerning the State of the Kingdom, he came a little more secure to <hi>Edinburgh.</hi>

Thither presently they sent a party of Horse, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Offendor: but <hi>Cockburn</hi> alleged several things in excuse, on purpose to create some Delayes, that so he might have an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to convey him away secretly; of which the Cardinal being inform'd, made haste thither with the Regent, even in the dead time of the Night, and beset all the Avenues of the House; and yet their Promises, Flatteries and Threats prevailed not at all, till they sent for the Earl of <hi>Bothwel</hi> out of the next District, he, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the chief of all the <hi>Lothianers,</hi> did easily obtain, that <hi>George</hi> should be deliver'd up to Him; but first, he past his Word, that no Harm or Damage should come to him. The Priests having now gotten this Prey into their Hands, carried him from <hi>Edinburgh</hi> to St. <hi>Andrews</hi>; and there about a Month after, they assembled a great Company of Ecclesiasticks, of all sorts, to determine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his Doctrine; this was done to blind Men's Eyes with the pretence of a Judicatory, and a legal Proceeding; for all Men knew, what they would determine concerning him before-hand.

against the Servants of God, and, who had no other Crime objected against them, besides the preaching the Gospel of Jesus Christ; and especially to such, whose flagitious Lives, and brutish Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, cared not what Torments they put an innocent Man to; whose Integrity of Life, his very Enemies were forc'd to confess, even against their Will, and, for his Learning, he himself knew it to be great; that further, he himself had been formerly a great Favourer of him, and it: 'Twas by his Commendation, that he was advanc'd to the Supream Magistracy; and also, that he had given forth Edicts to declare his assent to his Doctrine pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly, and had undertook to defend it; yea, he had exhorted all in general, and each Man in particular, to read, understand, practice and exemplify it in their Hearts and Lives: Consider therefore with your self, said he, what will Men think, what will Men say of you, consider the Mercies God Almighty hath bestowed upon you: The King, an active Man, and your Enemy was taken away, who walk'd in the very same steps you now tread.

<pb n="95" facs="tcp:56771:273"/>
he would have no Recognition made; so that he was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gingly angry, and persisted in the Resolution he had taken;<note place="margin">Whereupon the Cardinal proceeds a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, by his own Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</note> and his Reply was, That he did not write to the Regent, as if he had not sufficient Authority independently without him, but for a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious pretence to the Vulgar, that his Name might be to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation. Hereupon <hi>George</hi> was brought out of Prison, and <hi>Iohn Windram,</hi> a learned Man, and an hearty, though secret, Favourer of the Cause of Religion, was commanded to mount a kind of Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit there erected, and to preach; he took his Text out of <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. which says, That <hi>the Good Seed is the Word of God, but the Evil Seed is Heresy:</hi> In his Discourse, defining Heresy, he said, It was a false Opinion, evidently repugnant to the Holy Scriptures, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with Obstinacy; and that 'twas occasioned, and also sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported and fostered, by the Ignorance of the Pastors of the Church, who did not know, how, either to convince Hereticks, or to reduce those who were gone astray, by the Spiritual Sword, which is the Word of God. Afterwards he explained the Duty of a Bishop, out of the Epistle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and shewed, that there was only <hi>one</hi> way to find out Heresy, which was to bring it to the <hi>Test</hi> of the Word of God. At length, when he made an end, though what he spoke made against the Priests, who were there assembled not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute Heresies, but to punish those who opposed their licentious Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogance; yet, as if all things went well on their side, they hale forth <hi>George</hi> to a Pulpit or Scaffold, built in the Church; that so they might observe their accustomed Form in Judgment; over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him there was another Pulpit, which <hi>Iohn Lauder,</hi> a Popish Priest, mounted, and the rest stood all about him, as 'twere, to judg; but there was not the least appearance of a Judgment, or of a free Disputation in the Case. For the Accuser thundred out many odious and abominable Slanders, such as are wont to be commonly forg'd against the Preachers of the purest Doctrine, with great A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerbity of Words; and thus having spent some hours, <hi>George</hi> was brought back again to the Castle, and lodg'd in the Governour's Chamber, spending great part of his Time that Night in Prayer: The next Morning, the Bishops sent two <hi>Franciscans</hi> to him, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint him, that his Death was at hand, and to know, whether they should confess him, as is usual in such Cases? he told them, he had nothing to do with <hi>Friars,</hi> nor had any mind to discourse them; but if they had a mind to gratify him in the thing, then he desired to confer with that learned Man which preach'd yesterday. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Bishops gave him leave to go to the Castle, and <hi>George</hi> had a long Discourse with <hi>Windram,</hi> who, after he had ceas'd weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, (which for a while he could not refrain) very friendly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of him, whether he would receive the Sacrament of the <hi>Lord's Supper?</hi> With all my heart, said <hi>George,</hi> if I may receive it under both kinds of Bread and Wine, according to Christ's Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: <hi>Windram</hi> return'd to the Bishops, and told them, that <hi>George</hi> did solemnly profess,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>George Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heart</hi>'s pious and Christian Leportment before his Death.</note> that he was innocent of the Crime of which he was accused; which he spake, not to deprecate his Death now at hand, but only to testify his Innocency before Men, as 'twas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore sufficiently known to God. The Cardinal was much inraged,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:56771:274"/>
Ay, says he, we know well enough what you are. Being further demanded, whether he would admit him to receive the Sacrament? he talk'd a little with the Bishops, and, with their Consent, made Answer, That 'twas not fit that a stubborn Heretick, condemn'd by the Church, should enjoy any Benefits of the Church. That An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer was return'd to him; and about nine of the Clock, the Friends and Officers of the Governor of the Castle sat down to Breakfast, they asked <hi>George,</hi> whether he would eat with them? Very wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, said he, and much more so than in former times, because, I perceive, that you are good Men, and Fellow-members with me of the same Body of Christ, and because, I know, that this is the last Meal I shall eat on Earth. And for you, (speaking to the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of the Castle) I desire you in the Name of God, and for that Love which you bear to our Lord and Saviour <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> that you'l sit down a while with us, and vouchsafe me the Hearing, whilst I give you a short Exhortation, and so pray over this Bread, which, as Brethren in Christ, we are about to eat, and then I will bid you Farewel. In the Interim, the Cloth was laid (according to Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom) and Bread set on, when <hi>George</hi> made a brief and clear Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course for about half an hour concerning Christ's last Supper, his Sufferings and Death. But, above all, he exhorted them to lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side Anger, Envy and Malice, and to have mutual Love impress'd on their Minds, that so they might become perfect Members of Christ, who daily intercedes for us with his Father, that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice might be accepted by him to Eternal Life. When he had thus spoken, he gave Thanks, and then brake the Bread, and gave to every one a piece; and then the Wine, after he himself had drank in the same manner, intreating them to remember the Death of Christ now in the last Sacrament with him; as for himself, a bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer Portion was prepared for him for no other reason, but his preaching the Gospel; and then having again given Thanks, he returned to his Chamber, and concluded with Prayer. A while af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, two Executioners were sent to him by the Cardinal, one of them put a black Linen Shirt upon him, and the other bound many little Bags of Gunpowder to all the Parts of his Body: In this Dress they brought him forth, and commanded him to stay in the Chamber, without the Governour's. And at the same time, they erected a Wooden Scaffold in the Court before the Castle, and made up a Pile of Wood. The Windows and Forts of the Castle over against it, were all hung with Tapestry and silk Hangings, with Cushions for the Cardinal, with his Train, to behold, and take pleasure in the joyful Sight, even the Torture of an innocent Man; thus endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to curry Favour with the Vulgar, as the Author of so no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table a Prank. There was also a great Guard of Souldiers, not so much to secure the Execution, as for a vain Ostentation of his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; and besides, Brass Guns were plac'd up and down in all conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Places of the Castle. Thus, whilst the Trumpets sounded, <hi>George</hi> was brought forth, mounted the Scaffold, and was fastened with a Cord to the Stake, and, having scarce obtain'd Liberty to pray for the Church of God, the Executioners fired the Wood, which took hold of the Powder tied about him immediately, and
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:56771:274"/>
blew it up into Flame and Smoke. The Governor of the Castle, who stood so near that he was sing'd with the Flame, exhorted him, in a few words, to be of good chear, and to ask Pardon of God for his Offences: To whom he replied,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>George Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heart</hi>'s Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, at his death, concerning the Cardinal's Fall.</note>
               <q>This Flame occasions trouble to my Body indeed, but it hath in no wise broken my Spirit: But He, who now so proudly looks down upon me from yonder lofty Place, (pointing to the Cardinal) shall 'ere long be as ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously thrown down, as now he proudly lies at his Ease.</q>
Having thus spoken, they straitned the Rope,<note place="margin">The Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>George Wiseheart.</hi>
               </note> which was tied about his Neck, and so strangled him; his Body in a few hours was consum'd to Ashes in the Flame, and the Bishop, being yet mad with Hate and Rage, forbad every body, upon great Penalties, to pray for the Deceased.</p>
            <p>After this Fact, the Cardinal was highly commended by his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and extolled to the very Skies, that he alone, when others declined it, had slighted the Authority of the Regent, and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med so noble an Exploit, whereby he had curb'd popular Insolency, and had couragiously undertook, and as happily manag'd the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the whole Ecclesiastical Order. If the Church had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had (said they) such valiant Assertors of its Liberties, it would never have been brought to that Pass, as it is at this Day, (<hi>i. e.</hi>) to truckle under, but it would have given Law to all, and received it from none. This luxuriant and superlative Joy of the Priests for their obtained Victory, did rather irritate than discourage the Minds, not only of the promiscuous Vulgar, but even of some great and noble Persons also: They fretted, that things were come to that pass by their own Cowheartedness, so that now some bold thing or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was to be attempted and hazarded, or else they were Slaves for ever. Hereupon more Company came in to them, whose Grief en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forc'd them to brake out in Complaints against the Cardinal, so that they encouraged one another to rid the Cardinal out of the way, and either to recover their Liberty, or lose their Lives; For what hope of thriving, said they, could there be under so arrogant a Priest, and so cruel a Tyrant, who made War against God as well as Men, and those, not his Enemies only, as were all such as had Estates, or were any way pious; but if he bore but a grudg against a Man,<note place="margin">The foul Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Beton.</hi>
               </note> he would hale him, as a Hog out of the Sty, to be sacrific'd to his Lusts. And besides, he was a publick Encourager and Maintainer of War, both at Home and Abroad; and in his private capacity, he mixed the Love of Harlots, with lawful Marriages. Legitimate Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock he dissolv'd at pleasure; at Home he wallowed in Lust among his Minions, and Abroad he ravag'd to destroy the Innocent. The Cardinal himself, though he did not distrust his own Power, yet knowing how People stood affected towards him, and what Reports were spread up and down concerning him, thought it his best way to strengthen his Power by some new Accession or other. Hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he went to <hi>Angus,</hi> and married his eldest Daughter to the Son of the Earl of <hi>Crawford</hi>; the Marriage was solemnized in great State, and (almost) with a Royal Magnificence. Whilst these things were acting, he received Intelligence by his Spies, That the King of <hi>England</hi> was making great Naval Preparations to infest
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:56771:275"/>
the <hi>Scotish</hi> Coasts, but especially the Inhabitants of <hi>Fife,</hi> whom he threatned most: Whereupon he returned to St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> and there appointed a Day for the Nobility, especially those, whose Estates lay near to the Sea, to meet, and to consult in common, what Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy to apply to the present Malady. And to do it more effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he determined to take a View of all the Sea-Coasts, together with the Owners of the <hi>Lands,</hi> and so in a manner to circuit about all <hi>Fife,</hi> and to fortify all convenient Places, and to put Garisons into them. Amongst the rest of the Noble Mens Sons, who came in to the Cardinal, <hi>Norman Lesly,</hi> Son to the Earl of <hi>Rothes,</hi> was one, of whom I have made mention several times before: He had done great and eminent Service for the Cardinal, but, on a time, there fell out a Dispute between them concerning a private busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, which estrang'd them a while, one from another; but <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> upon great Promises made to him, quitted his Right in the Matter contested for: After a few Months, coming to demand of the Cardinal the performance of what was promised him, they fell from plain Discourse to chiding, and afterwards to downright rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, uttering such reproachful words one to another, as were seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for neither of them; and thus they parted in a great Rage one from another; the Cardinal fretting, that he was not treated with that Deference which was due to his Dignity; and <hi>Norman,</hi> full of Wrath and Rage, as being circumvented by Fraud, so that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned home, with thoughts full of Revenge, and inveighed open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly amongst his Friends, against the intolerable Pride of the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, insomuch that they all agreed to take away his Life: And, that the matter might pass with the least Suspicion,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Norman Lesly,</hi> with a few Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisans, surprises the Castle of S. <hi>Andrews,</hi> and kills Cardinal <hi>Beton,</hi> accord-to <hi>George Wist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heart</hi>'s Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy before-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</note> 
               <hi>Norman,</hi> with five only in his Company, came to St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> and took up his usual Inn, that so the design of cutting him off might be concealed, by reason of the paucity of his Attendants. There were Ten more in the Town, privy to the Conspiracy; who all, in several Places, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected the Watch-word: With this small Company, did he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take so great an Enterprise, and that in a Town which was full of the Cardinal's Train, Kindred and Attendants. The Days were then very long, as they use to be in those Countries, towards the end of the Spring, <hi>viz.</hi> about <hi>May</hi> 7. And the Cardinal was fortifying his Castle for Defence<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> in so great haste, that the Work-men conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued at it almost Night and Day; so that, when the Porter, early in the Morning, opened the Gates to let in the Workmen, <hi>Norman</hi> had plac'd two of his Men in Ambush, in an House hard by, who were to seize the Porter; and when they had made themselves Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of the Gate, they were to give a Sign, agreed on, to the rest: By this means they all entred the Castle without any Noise, and sent four of their number to watch the Cardinal's Chamber-door, that no Tidings might be carried in to him; others were appointed to go to the Chambers of the rest of the Houshold, to call them up, (for they well knew both the Men and the Place); them they rouz'd up, being half asleep; and calling them all by their Names, they threatned immediately to kill them, if they made but the least Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry; so that they led them all, in great silence, out of the Castle, without doing them any hurt at all: When all the rest were put
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:56771:275"/>
out, then they alone were Masters of the Castle; whereupon, those, who watched at the Cardinal's Door, knocked at it. They with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in asked them their Names: they told them, and then they were let in; having, as some write, past their words, that they would hurt no body; and when they were entred, they dispatch'd the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal with many Wounds. In the mean time, a Noise was spread about the whole Town, that the Castle was taken, insomuch that the Cardinal's Friends, half drunk, and half sleeping, started out of their Beds, and cried out <hi>Arm</hi>; thus to the Castle they posted, and called out, with minacious and opprobrious words, for Ladders; other things they also brought, necessary for a Storm. They, who saw them out of the Castle, that they might blunt the present Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuousness of their Minds, and call back their mad Spirits to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider themselves, crying out to them, demanded, why they made such a bustle? for the Man was dead whom they sought to rescue, and with that word they threw the dead Body out in the sight of them all, even out of that very place, where before he had rejoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cingly beheld the Execution of <hi>George Wiseheart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereupon, many did revolve, within themselves, the Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy of human Affairs, and that unexpected Event; many also were affected with the Prediction of <hi>George Wiseheart,</hi> concerning his Death, which then came into their Minds; and many other things also, which that holy Man had foretold, not without the special Inspiration of God's Spirit, (as we have cause to believe, and as the Event soon after made appear.) The Cardinal's Friends and Kinsmen, being astonish'd at this unexpected sight, soon sculk'd away. When the matter was divulg'd all over the Kingdom, Mens Minds were variously affected, as they either hated or loved the Cardinal; some thought it a brave, others a nefarious, Fact. There were many also, who, being in a different way of Worship from him, were afraid of their Lives, and others were offended at his intolerable Arrogance; these did not only approve the Fact, but came to gratulate the Committers of it, as the Restorers of their ancient Liberties, and some of them ventured their Lives and Fortunes in their Quarrel. The Court was grievously affrighted at the News, as having lost part of their Council; but, by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of those which were present, they sent forth a Proclamation,<note place="margin">Those that slew the Cardinal, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thus the matter was protracted, partly by the Threats and vain Promises of the one party, and the Diffidence of the other, from the Month of <hi>May</hi> till the <note n="*" place="margin">

whole Months before the Castle, battering it with his Brass Guns; but, in the fourth Month, almost at the End of Winter, he dismiss'd his Army, without carrying the Place, and went to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> to be present at the Convention of Estates, which he had before indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be held in <hi>February.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They, who held the Castle, being thus freed from fear of their Enemy, did not only make frequent Excursions into the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Parts, and commit Depredations with Fire and Sword therein; but, as if the Liberty gotten by their Arms, were to be spent in Whoredoms, Adulteries, and such Vices, they ran into all the Wickedness, which idle Persons are subject to; for they measured Right and Wrong by no other Rule but their own Lust; neither could they be reclaimed by <hi>Iohn Knox,</hi>

            <p>Besides this domestick Mischief raging even in the very Bowels of the Kingdom, there was an Accession made by a War with <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>English</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </note> For the <hi>English</hi> had pass'd over the <hi>Solway</hi> with their Forces, and made People terribly afraid; they were not contented with the Pillage and Prey, but they fired some Places, took some Strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds, and put Garisons in them. Neither were Matters quieter in the other parts of the Borders; <hi>Robert Maxwel,</hi> upon whom the greatest part of the Storm fell, came to <hi>Edinburgh</hi> to crave Aid, when almost all was lost; he alleged, that the Country was desola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that their Garisons were taken and kept by their Enemies, that the Husbandman was driven away from his Habitation, and forc'd to live, in much want, on the Charity of his Friends, and that they suffered all this, because they would not change nor forfeit their Fidelity to their King; but if no Course were taken for their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, in some short time, their Miseries would compel them to give themselves up to the <hi>English</hi>; and so would their Neighbours too, for fear they should undergo the like. Hereupon, Aid was promised him to recover his Own; and the Regent marching his Army thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, formed his Camp by the River <note n="â€ " place="margin">A small River in <hi>Ewsdale.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Meggat.</hi> There the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal's Friends earnestly desired of him to call <hi>George Lesly, Norman</hi>'s Father,<note place="margin">The Regent marches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish.</hi>

From thence they marched to the Castle of <note n="â€–" place="margin">Or <hi>Lang-hope,</hi> lying near the Conduence of the Rivers <hi>Esk</hi> and <hi>Ewes</hi> in <hi>Ewsdale.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Langham,</hi> from thence they drove out the <hi>English</hi>; and, as they resolved to attempt other Forts, they were call'd back by a sudden Message.

               </note> St. <hi>Ebb,</hi> wherein were one and twenty Ships. The Regent imagining what the matter was, that they were come
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:56771:276"/>
to besiege the Castle of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> (as had been agreed between them) march'd joyfully home, there he discoursed <hi>Leon Strozy,</hi> Admiral of the <hi>French</hi> Fleet, and they both agreed to lay close Siege to the Castle, which they did, with so much Celerity, that many of the Garison-Souldiers, which were abroad could not come in, and many Country-men, which had no hand in the Conspiracy, but occasionally came into the Castle, about their private Affairs, could not get out. They planted their Brass Guns upon the Towers of two Churches, which stood near on both sides the Castle, which did so annoy the whole Court within the Castle-Walls, that the Defenders could hardly stir in or out. And afterwards they brought bigger pieces of Ordnance, and play'd upon part of the Wall, which stood between two <hi>Towers,</hi> which was soon batter'd down, because the later Buildings were not at all compacted with the former, and so it fell down with a mighty Noise. Hereupon they within, who before trusted to their Fortifications, and were ready to expose themselves to stop any Breach, now began to be afraid, and calling together a Council of War, because they fear'd the Cruelty of the Regent in revenging the Death of his Kinsman, (such Sentiments making deep Impressions on infirm Minds) they surrendred the Castle and themselves to <hi>Leon Strozy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">St. <hi>Andrews</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle taken by the Regent, with the Assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the <hi>French.</hi>
               </note> only upon Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for Life. <hi>Leon</hi> hereupon sent in his Men to pillage the Castle, wherein was found, besides a great Quantity of Provisions of all sorts, all the Cardinal's Mony and Houshold-stuff, and all the Wealth of the Garison-Souldiers, and of many others also, who had laid up their Goods there, as in a place of Refuge; there also they found the Regent's Son, who was before given in Hostage by his Father to the Cardinal, and, when he was slain, was detain'd there. The Castle was demolish'd by Advice and Order of the Council; and a few days after, <hi>Leon</hi> set Sail, with his Prisoners, for <hi>France.</hi> These things fell out in <hi>August,</hi> 1547.</p>
            <p>About the same time, News was brought, that the <hi>English</hi> had prepared great Forces both by Land and Sea to invade <hi>Scotland,</hi> and to demand the Performance of the Treaty, which was made four Years before with the Regent, concerning the Marriage of the Queen of <hi>Scotland</hi> to the King of <hi>England</hi>'s Son. This sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Report mightily affected the Regent, who was faint-hearted enough of himself, for he had then no foreign Aid, neither did he much confide in his own forces:<note place="margin">The <hi>English</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Scotland,</hi> and repulse the Regent's For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> For the Papal Faction were offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at his Levity, and the Friends of exil'd <hi>Lennox</hi> having been cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly intreated by him, retained the Seeds of their old Hatred against him; yet, upon his Proclamation, there came in great numbers to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> from thence they march'd to the Mouth of the River <hi>Esk,</hi> which runs through <hi>Lothian,</hi> and there waited for the coming of the <hi>English.</hi> In the mean time, the <hi>Scotish</hi> Horse rode up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Enemy in their March, and challenged them to fight, by this means creating some trouble to them in their Passage: But the <hi>English</hi> General, who knew that the <hi>Scots</hi> were better than his own Men at such tumultuary Skirmishes, had given Command, that none of his Troops should march out to encounter them. At last upon the Importunity of <hi>Grey,</hi> Commander of the Horse, he
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:56771:277"/>
was persuaded to send out some Troops of Horse well-armed, and of Curiasiers, which should suddenly rush in upon them, unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for Resistance; The <hi>Scots</hi> being grown fearless of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, but now astonish'd at the sudden Onset, brake their Ranks, and fled for their Lives, and about 800 of them were either slain or taken; of the <hi>English</hi> also, who prest too eagerly on the pursuit, several were taken Prisoners, amongst which were some eminent Horse-Commanders. From that day forward, there was no memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Action performed by the <hi>Scotish</hi> Horse. The <hi>English</hi> had their Camp at the Town of <note n="â€ " place="margin">Two Miles East of <hi>Mussel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough</hi> in <hi>East-Lothian.</hi>

From thence they might behold the number of the <hi>Scotish</hi> Army from the high Ground, and perceiving them to be more than they thought, they advised what course to take, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to send Letters to the <hi>Scots,</hi> that so, if just and equal Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions might be agreed on, the matter might be compos'd rather by Treaty than by Force.<note place="margin">The <hi>English</hi> send Letters to the <hi>Scots,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasory to Peace,</note> The Contents of the Letters, were;
<q>They earnestly desired the <hi>Scots</hi> to remember, that both Armies profess'd the Christian Religion, to whom (unless they did renounce their Profession) nothing ought to be more dear than Peace and Tranquillity, and nothing more to be abhorr'd than unjust Arms and War; that the cause of the present War, was not Covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Hatred, or Envy, but a Desire of perpetual Peace, which could no ways so firmly coalesce as by a Marriage, which had been already promised by the publick Decree and Consent of all the Estates, and ratified by a League, and that on such Conditions, as were more advantageous to the <hi>Scots</hi> than the <hi>English,</hi> not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them into an Estate of Servitude, but to a joint Society of Life, and Participation, and Communion, of all their Fortunes; which Marriage would be so much the more beneficial to the <hi>Scots</hi> than <hi>English,</hi> because the Weaker might expect Advantage from the Stronger, as being possess'd with a greater Fear, lest he might be wrong'd by him: And, at the present, in casting up ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of things, you are first to consider the Case, that it is very necessary your Queen should marry, that necessity was inevitable, and that it was a difficult thing to moderate it, and that the sole Power of chusing her an Husband was left to the Estates; If they would chuse a Family upon the account of Dignity and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Advantage, whom could they pitch upon better, than a Neighbour King, born in the same Island, ally'd in Blood, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted in the same Laws, educated in the same Manners and Language, and superior not in Power alone, but in all external Ornaments and Accessions of Dignity? And besides, this Marriage would bring with it a perpetual Concord, and an Oblivion of all old Grudges. But if they had Thoughts to bring in a Stranger a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monst them, to undertake the Kingdom, that differ'd from them in Language, Laws and Customs, they should consider, how many Inconveniences lodg'd in the Belly of that Design, which they might easily foresee by the Examples of other Nations, and 'twere better so to do, than to learn it by Trial and feeling the Smart thereof. As for themselves, if they found the Spirits of the <hi>Scots</hi> not wholly averse from an Agreement, they were ready
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:56771:277"/>
to remit something of the Rigour of Law, and Right; and that they would be content the young Queen should be educated under <hi>Scotish</hi> Supervisors, till she came to be marriagable, and fit, by the Advice of the Nobles, to chuse an Husband for her self; and till that time came, both sides should abstain from War and Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine; and that the Queen should not be transported beyond Sea, nor that any Treaty should be intertain'd by the <hi>Scots</hi> concerning her Marriage with the <hi>French,</hi> or any other foreign Prince: If the <hi>Scots</hi> would faithfully promise this, they would presently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part and withdraw their Forces, and as for what Damage they had done, since they entred <hi>Scotland,</hi> they would make Restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as indifferent Men should award.</q>
            </p>
            <p>These Letters were brought to the Regent, who communicated them to his Brother <hi>Iohn,</hi> Archbishop of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> whom he had assum'd into the Place and Authority of the Cardinal, and to some few others: They, in hopes of a sure Victory, gave him ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to suppress them; for they were afraid, that if the Equity of the Proposals were made known, the <hi>Scots</hi> would be taken off, and hearken to terms of Peace, and therefore they gave out through the whole Army, that the <hi>English</hi> were come on purpose to take away their Queen by force, and to reduce the Land to their own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection. And the Regent, being naturally unactive, had chosen four, no more versed in Military Affairs than himself, who did turn and wind all things at their Pleasure; those were his three Kinsmen and Allies, <hi>Iohn</hi> his Brother, Archbishop of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> and Abbat of <hi>Dumfermlin; George Dury; Alexander Beton</hi>; and the 4<hi>th</hi> was <hi>Hugh Riggs</hi> a Lawyer, noted more for his big Body, Corpulency, and bulky Strength, than for any Military Skill. These Men did so puff up the Regent with a vain hope of Victory, that, being of himself inconstant and variable in his Designs at every blast of Wind, he shut his Ears against the advice of all others.<note place="margin">Which being rejected by the Regent,</note> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, when the Regent's Privadoes had caus'd the Report, which they themselves had raised, to be spred all over the Army, they all ran hastily to their Arms. <hi>Archibald Douglas,</hi> Earl of <hi>Angus,</hi> led the Van; <hi>George Gordon,</hi> Earl of <hi>Huntly,</hi> brought up the Rear, each of them had 10000 fighting Men, and the Regent had about the same number in the main Battel. In this Posture, a Report was suddenly rais'd, that the <hi>English</hi> were fled away, and it was not altogether without ground; for they, wanting Provision, and not being able to fetch it from far, nor to forage for it in the Neighbour-hood, which was so unfurnish'd afore, thought it the best way to preserve themselves, if they left their Baggage behind them, and march'd long Marches backward, but having so many arm'd Men ready to ingage, seeing they durst not come down into the Campagn, nor could deceive the Enemy by going about, they waited his coming on the higher ground. On the other side, the Regent was impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient of Delay, and sent one to <hi>Douglas</hi> to march on with speed; but he knowing, that the <hi>English</hi> could not long keep that ground for want of Provision, and so waited to fall on the Rear, made no great haste, till he was stirr'd up by another Messenger from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, then, and not before, he past over the River. The main Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel,

and the Rear, following at a great Distance after. The <hi>English</hi> who were about to depart, perceiving <hi>Douglas</hi> to draw towards them upon the Speed, sent out <hi>Grey,</hi> Commander of the Horse with his whole Body to meet him, and stop his Carreer, till the Foot had possess'd themselves of a Neighbour-hill; or, if he saw cause, he was to disturb them in their ranks; for, seeing the major part of them were arm'd after the <hi>French</hi> mode, they thought the <hi>Scots</hi> would never be able to bear the brunt of their charge: But a Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gade of the <hi>Scots</hi> marching in close order together,<note place="margin">He gives them Ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

The <hi>Scots</hi> were held from marching forward to the opposite Hill, chiefly upon this account, because they perceived <hi>Iambo</hi> a Spaniard, with some Troops of his Country-men, Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuisiers, to come down obliquely from the Hill, as if he would fall on their Flank; and therefore, that no sudden Emergency might cause them to divide their Brigade, and also that they might not be attack'd on their Flanks, they wheeled about leisurely from the right ascent of the Hill. The main Battel, when they saw the Van to leave their Station, thought, that they were running away, so that they also broke their Ranks, and betook themselves to their Heels. The <hi>English,</hi> seeing this from the high Grounds, sent out their Horse,<note place="margin">But receives a great Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw.</note> and trod many of them under foot in the pursuit. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all this March from <hi>Esk</hi> to the <hi>English</hi> Camp, the <hi>English</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy plaid upon the Flank of the <hi>Scots</hi> out of their Ships, and did them much Mischief. All the Ways were strow'd with Arms, by reason of the great Slaughter which was made, and many also were drown'd in the River. The <hi>English</hi> were most severe against the Priests and the Monks, (for those of that Tribe, who were lusty and able to bear Arms, came into the Field) and there were many who imputed the loss of the Day to them, who had arrogant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refused honest Conditions of Peace, and who, if they had the Victory, would have used it as cruelly towards their own Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, as their Enemies. In the first Charge, the <hi>English</hi> lost about 200 Horse, but of the <hi>Scots</hi> there fell the prime of all the noblest Families, with their Relations and Tenants, who counted it a flagitious thing to desert them; many were taken in the Pursuit. The High-landers gathered themselves together in a round Body, kept their Ranks, and returned safe home; for, at first, they march'd through craggy places, and inconvenient for Horse, and if they were sometimes necessitated to descend into the Plains, yet the <hi>English</hi> Horse, who followed the Pursuit scatter'dly, durst not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack them.

            <p>Their sudden Departure gave some Relief to the <hi>Scots,</hi> and a breathing-time for them to meet together to consult about the main chance. The Regent, presently after the Fight,<note place="margin">The <hi>English</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat out of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </note> came with that part of the Nobles which were with him to the two Queens at <hi>Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi> and to the Nobility attending there; the Regent and his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were very sad and dejected for the Calamity which happen'd by their Default, and the Queen <hi>Dowager</hi> gave forth many outward Signs of Grief in her Speech and Countenance, but they which knew her Heart did judg, that she was not much troubled to see the Arrogance of the <hi>Hamiltons</hi> so curbed; but to be joyous in a publick Calamity, they who use to cover the Faults of Princes under honest Disguises, are wont to call Greatness of Mind. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, the <hi>Dowager,</hi> ever since the Death of the Cardinal, had used all ways and means to throw the Regent out of his Office, and to invest the supream Authority in her self, but she knew she could never effect it, as long as They were uppermost, and had all forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied places in their Hands: In all her Discourse, she heighten'd the Fear she had from the <hi>English,</hi> and complained of the Weakness of their own domestick Forces, and propounded the Dangers imminent from the civil Dissensions amongst them: She communicated her Design to those, who she knew, were ill affected towards the <hi>Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons.</hi> When the Nobles were in Consultation about the grand Affairs of the Kingdom, a Decree was made, that the Queen should retire to <hi>Dunbarton,</hi> whilst the Nobility did debate concerning the Estate of the Kingdom: <hi>Iohn Erskin</hi> was made Governour of it, an unquestionable Favourer of the Queen's Faction, and <hi>William Levingston,</hi> a Friend to the <hi>Hamiltons,</hi> was join'd in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission with him. Embassadors were also sent into <hi>France</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand Aid of their King <hi>Henry</hi> against their common Enemy, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the League made with him: Hopes was also given them, that the Queen would come over into <hi>France,</hi> and marry the <hi>Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin</hi>; but the <hi>French</hi> were intent upon their own Affairs, and therefore their Auxiliaries were slower than the present Danger re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</p>
            <p>In the mean time,<note place="margin">The <hi>English</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain enter <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
               </note> the <hi>English</hi> entred <hi>Scotland</hi> on both sides of the Borders: The Earl of <hi>Lennox,</hi> as if he had been sent for by his Friends, came to <hi>Dumfries</hi>; for his Father-in-Law <hi>Angus,</hi> and his old Friend <hi>Glencarne,</hi> had promised him two thousand Horse and Foot of the neighbouring Parts to assist him, if he would leave the <hi>English,</hi> and come over to them; but when he came at the Place
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:56771:279"/>
appointed, there were hardly Three hundred come together, and those too of such, who used to live on Robberies. These and some other things of the like Nature, being very suspicious, and speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the wavering Mind of <hi>Iohn Maxwel,</hi> who had already given Hostages to the <hi>English,</hi> made <hi>Lennox</hi> believe that he was betrayed, and therefore he resolved to circumvent his Enemies with the like Fraud; he retained with him <hi>Glencarn, Iohn Maxwel,</hi> and other chief Men of the <hi>Scots,</hi> who had treated with him concerning his Transition and Return into his own Country, and in the middle of the Night march'd toward <hi>Drumlanerick,</hi> with six hundred Horse, part of the <hi>English</hi> and part of the <hi>Scots,</hi> who had yielded to them; when they came to the appointed Place, he sent out five hundred, to commit what Spoil they could in the neighbouring Parts, that so he might draw out <hi>Iames Douglas,</hi> Owner of the Castle, into his Ambush; he, imagining such a thing, kept within his Hold till 'twas Day; and then, being out of fear of Treachery, he marched out with his Men, and pass'd over the River <hi>Nith,</hi> and press'd straglingly upon the Plunderers, charging their Rear, as they were retreating.

This light Expedition struck such a Terror into the greatest part of <hi>Galway,</hi> that they strove which of them should yield first to the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,</hi> partly to gratify <hi>Lennox,</hi> and partly fearing, lest, being forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by their Neighbours, they should lie open to all Affronts. The <hi>Scotish</hi> Regent fearing, lest in such a general Hurly-burly, if he did attempt nothing, he should altogether dispirit his Men, who were discourag'd enough before, besieg'd the Castle of <hi>Brockty,</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving laid before it almost three Months, without performing any thing considerable, he drew off his Men, leaving only an hundred Horse under the Command of <hi>Iames Halyburton,</hi> an active young Man, to infest the neighbouring Places, and to hinder any Provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from being carried in by Land to <hi>Brockty,</hi> or to the Garison which the <hi>English</hi> had plac'd on an Hill adjoining. These Matters pass'd at the End of that Year.

They landed at <hi>Leith,</hi> and were ordered to quarter at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> till they had recovered their Sea-sickness. The Regent, and the Forces with him, marched to <hi>Hadington,</hi> where they beset all Passages, and laid a close Siege to the Place. He sent out a Proclamation into all Parts, in pursuance whereof, in a short time, there came into him about eight thousand <hi>Scots.</hi> There the Nobility assembled, and the Consultation was renewed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Queen's going into <hi>France,</hi> and marrying the <hi>Daulphin</hi>; a Council was called in a Monastery of Monks, without <hi>Hadington,</hi> in the very Camp. In that Convention there were various Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes; some said, that if they sent away the Queen, they must expect perpetual War from <hi>England,</hi> and Bondage from the <hi>French</hi>; others were of opinion, that by reason of Agreement in Religion, and the Condition of the present Times, it was best to embrace the Terms offered by the <hi>English,</hi> which were a Ten Years Peace, with no bad Covenants or Obligations on the <hi>Scots.</hi> For the whole of the League was, That, if the King of <hi>England,</hi> or Queen of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> died within ten years, all things should be, on both sides, as they were before; and though no fortuitous Event should happen between, yet the Kingdom might be hereby freed from its present Pressures, which had almost broke its Strength; and the Souldiery, which were almost all lost in the late Battel, might have time to grow up and increase in a long continued Peace; and, that intestine Discord being laid asleep, they might more maturely consider of the Grand Affairs, than they could do amongst Drums and Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets: And in such Consultations, Delays were oftentimes of great Advantage, and rash Festination was attended with speedy Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: Thus They. But all the Papists favoured the <hi>French,</hi> and some others too, whom <hi>French</hi> Bounty had either forestalled, or else had rais'd up to great hopes of Advantage; amongst whom, was the Regent; he had an yearly Revenue of 1200 <hi>French</hi> Pistols pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised him, and the Command of an 100 Curiassiers; so that the most Voices carried it, for the Queen's going into <hi>France:</hi> The Fleet, which was to convey her, rode at <hi>Leith</hi>; and,<note place="margin">The Queen of <hi>Scotland</hi> sails into <hi>France.</hi>
               </note> making as if they would go away, they sailed about all <hi>Scotland,</hi> and came to <hi>Dunbarton,</hi> where the Queen went on Ship-board, (having staid some Months for its Arrival) in the Company of <hi>Iames</hi> her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Iohn Erskin,</hi> and <hi>William Levingston:</hi> She was tossed with much foul Weather, and contrary Winds, but at last landed in <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taign,</hi> a Peninsule in <hi>France,</hi> and, by easy Journies, went to Court.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Scotland,</hi> whilst the War stopp'd at <hi>Hadington,</hi> yet the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People in several Places were not wanting to the present Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.

               </note> where the Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Unaccessibleness of the Place, made those within less watchful, and so they killed the Sentinels, and took the Castle. And not long after, when the Governor of <hi>Fascastle</hi> had command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Country thereabouts to bring in a great quantity of Provisions into the Castle, at a certain Day. The Country, upon this occasion,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:56771:280"/>
came numerously in, and unlading their Horses, they took up the Provision on their backs, to carry them over a Bridg, made betwixt two Rocks, into the Castle; assoon as ever they were entred, they threw down their Burden, and upon a Sign given, slew the Guards, and, before the rest of the <hi>English</hi> could come in, they seized on their Arms, and placed themselves in the Avenues; and thus, set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Gates open for their whole Party to enter, they made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves Masters of the Castle. In the mean time, the Naval Force of the <hi>English</hi> was not idle; for the whole stress of the Land-War lying upon <hi>Hadington,</hi> their Commanders thought that the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Parts were weakned and spoiled of all Defence, so that they resolved to land in <hi>Fife.</hi> And accordingly they pass'd by some Sea-Towns, which were well inhabited, and came to <note n="â€–" place="margin">Standing on the <hi>Firth</hi> of <hi>Forth</hi> in <hi>Fife.</hi>
               </note> St. <hi>Minnans Kirk,</hi> a Place peopled well enough, that from thence they might march by Land, to greater Towns, but less fortified, where the Pillage might be more worth their Labour. <hi>Iames Stuart,</hi> the Queen's Brother, receiving the Alarum, which the People of Saint <hi>Andrews,</hi> and a few of the Country-men which were left at home, made towards them, and in his way many of the Neighbourhood struck in with him.

But as they were making to Shoar in the dark, they discovered themselves by their own Imprudency, by hanging out Lights in every Boat; <hi>Iohn Erskin</hi> of <hi>Downe,</hi> Governour of the Town, commanded his Men to arm, without making any Noise, and he divided them into three Bodies;<note place="margin">The <hi>English</hi> Seamen land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>Scotland</hi> in two places, are twice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsed.</note> he placed some behind an earthen Bank, which was rais'd on the Shoar, to hinder their landing; he, with some Archers lightly arm'd, made directly towards the Enemy; and a third Band of Servants and promiscuous Vulgar, he plac'd behind a Neighbour Hill, adding a few Souldiers to them, to govern the Rabble; Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters being thus order'd, he with his Archers fell upon the Enemy in their Descent, and maintain'd a sharp Dispute with them, till in a tumultuary kind of Fight, he had drawn them on to the Banks, there he join'd his other Party, who stood ready at their Arms, and they all fell on the Enemy; yet they had not given Ground, unless the last Body had shewn themselves with Colours flying from the next Hill; then they made such haste to their Ships, that of about
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:56771:280"/>
800, which came on Shoar, hardly the third part escaped to their Ships.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, great Salleys were made about <hi>Hadington,</hi> not without loss on either side, but most, of the <hi>English</hi>; whereupon they being in some want of Provisions, and fearing a greater, and perceiving also, that the Relief prepared came slowly on, and that they were so weakned, as to be hardly able to admit of the Delay: In the Interim, two brave Souldiers, <hi>Robert Bovy</hi> and <hi>Thomas Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> were commanded to march thither from <hi>Berwick,</hi> with 1000 Foot and 300 Horse, and to make all the Speed they could. These all fell into an Ambush laid for them, and scarce a Man of them escaped alive. The <hi>English</hi> resolved to send more Aid, but the <hi>French,</hi> discovering their Design, beset the narrow Passages, by which they were to march; but <hi>Dessius,</hi> being deceived by one of the Enemies Scouts which he had taken, who told him, that the <hi>English</hi> were far off, and were marching another way to relieve the Besieged, left the Straits he had possess'd, and went to another Place; in the Interim,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hadington</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged by the <hi>Scots,</hi> but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved by the <hi>English.</hi>
               </note> the <hi>English</hi> marched thorow to their intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Post, without any hindrance. They brought with them 300 fresh Men, Powder and Bullet, and such other Provision as the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison stood in most need of.</p>
            <p>Whilst these things were acted at <hi>Hadington,</hi> which did not at all make to the Main of the War, News was brought, that the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> had levied a compleat Army to raise the Siege: Whereupon <hi>Dessius,</hi> knowing, that he was not able to encounter the Forces which were a coming, removed his Leaguer farther off from the Town, and sent back his Great Guns, all but six small Field-Pieces, to <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh.</hi> Upon the Coming of the <hi>English</hi> Army, the Siege was rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, because the <hi>Scots</hi> Commanders would not hazard the State of the Kingdom upon a single Battel; so that the <hi>Scots</hi> marched every one the next way home; the <hi>French</hi> also, though much press'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the <hi>English,</hi> yet got well off. The <hi>French</hi> Souldiers,<note place="margin">A Mutiny be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Scots</hi> at <hi>Edinburgh.</hi>
               </note> in their Return, slew the Governour of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and his Son, together with some of the Citizens who joined with them, because they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused to admit them into the Town with all their Forces, in regard, they knew, they could scarce keep them from plundring. <hi>Dessius</hi> in the Interim, lest the Sedition should increase, drew off; and withal supposing, that the Enemy would be more secure at <hi>Hading<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> because of their good Success, resolved to make an Attempt to surprize it on a sudden. Thither he marched all that Night, and by break of Day slew the Sentinels, and came up to the Walls; they took the Fort before the Gate, kill'd the Watch, some endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to break open the Gate; they also seized upon the Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the <hi>English.</hi> In this hurry, the Noise of those who were breaking open the Gates, and the Huzza's of the <hi>French,</hi> crying out, <hi>Victory, Victory,</hi> rous'd up the <hi>English</hi> from their Sleep, which they had newly fallen into. In this great hurly-burly,<note place="margin">The design of the <hi>French</hi> to surprize <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dington,</hi> disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed.</note> a Souldier set fire to a Brass Gun, placed casually against the Gate, that he might, in a present Danger, make Trial of a doubtful Remedy. The Bullet broke through the Gate, and made a Lane in the thick Ranks of the <hi>French,</hi> so that, what between the Exclamations of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:56771:281"/>
crying out <hi>Victory,</hi> and the Noise of the Gates which were broken, such a confused Clamor was carried to the Rear, that they were surprized with Fear, not knowing the Cause, and so fled, which occasioned the rest to follow after. The <hi>French</hi> being thus repuls'd with Loss, march'd into <hi>Teviotdale,</hi> which the <hi>English</hi> had done great Damage to; there, under the Conduct of <hi>Dessius,</hi> they drove the Enemy from <hi>Iedburgh,</hi> and made many Inrodes into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Ground, not without considerable Advantage. At length, when they had wasted all the Country,<note place="margin">The <hi>French</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gusted by the <hi>Scots,</hi> for their Cruelty and Oppressions.</note> besides their daily Duty, they were also in great Want, and the Commonalty pitied them the less, because of their Prank at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> for they looked upon that seditious Attempt as a Step to Tyranny. And from that time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, the <hi>French</hi> did nothing worth speaking of. The King of <hi>France</hi> was made acquainted by Letter from the Regent, and Queen Dowager, how <hi>Dessius</hi> spent much time on light Expeditions, and unprofitable ones, and that he was more injurious to his Friends than Enemies, and that the <hi>French</hi> Souldiers were grown so inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, since the Tumult at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> that, by reason of the intestine Discord,<note place="margin">

Dessius</hi> thought it would be for his Honour to recover the Island <hi>Keith,</hi> which was taken a few Days before, and was begun to be fortified; so that he got together a Fleet at <hi>Leith,</hi> and went aboard with a select Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>French.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dessius</hi> takes the Island <hi>Keith</hi> from the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,</hi> before his Departure.</note> The Queen was a Spectator of the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and egging them on, sometimes particularly, sometimes all in general, after he had landed in the Island, he drove the <hi>English</hi> into the highest Angle thereof, kill'd almost all their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, and compell'd them to a Surrender, but not without Blood. This was his last noble piece of Service in <hi>Britain,</hi> and then he surrendred up his Army to <hi>Termes. Termes</hi> drew forth the Army out of their Winter-Quarters, and commanded them to march towards the Northern Shires, he himself, <hi>Dessius</hi> being dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss'd, followed soon after, and laid Siege to the Fort of <hi>Brockty,</hi> and in a short time took it, and also the Castle adjoining, from the <hi>English,</hi> putting almost all of both Garisons to the Sword. When he was returned into <hi>Lothian,</hi> his great Care was, to hinder Provisions from being carried to <hi>Hadington</hi>; when, lo, upon a sudden, a great Army of <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Germans</hi> shewed themselves ready for the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter; whereupon he drew his Men backward, till he came to a Place of greater Safety. In the Interim, the <hi>Scots</hi> Cavalry, which skirted upon the Enemy on every side, perceiving the <hi>German</hi> Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage to be unguarded, plunder'd them in a moment.

For they who sat at helm, the Regent, and his Brother, the Archbishop of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> were both extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cruel and avaritious, and the Archbishop very licentious in his Conversation also; for, as if the Reins lay wholly loose on his Neck, his own Will was his Law. The first Presage of the ensuing Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, was, the suffering the Murder of <hi>William Creighton,</hi> an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Person, to go unrevenged; he was slain by <hi>Robert Semple,</hi> in the Regent's own Palace, and almost in his sight, and yet the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer was exempted from Punishment, by the Intercession of the Archbishop's Concubine, who was Daughter to <hi>Semple.</hi> This Archbishop, as long as the King liv'd, was one of his Confidents, and pretended a great Zeal for the Reformed Religion; but when the King was dead, he ran headlong into all flagitious Courses, and, amongst the rest of his Mistresses, he took away this young Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>Semple</hi> from her Husband, who was his Country-man and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and kept her almost in the Place of a lawful Wife, though she were not handsom, nor of good Report neither, but only noted for Wantonness. After this, followed the Death of <hi>Iohn Melvil,</hi> a a Noble-Man of <hi>Fife,</hi> who was a great Intimate of the last King's; Some Letters of his were intercepted, written to a certain <hi>English</hi>-man, in the behalf of his Friend, a Prisoner there; and though there could be no suspicion of Treason in the Case, yet the Author of them had his Head cut off. And that which made the Matter more foul, was, That his Estate was given to <hi>David,</hi> the Regent's youngest Son; the Loss, arising by these wicked Practices, reach'd but a few, but the Envy of them extended to many, and the bad Example almost to all.<note place="margin">The Regent's Government disrelished, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially after the Martyrdom of <hi>George Wiseheart.</hi>
               </note> This Unskilfulness of the Regent's mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the Government, together with the Sluggishness of all his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Life, did mightily offend the Commons; so that he every day grew more cheap than other, especially after the Suffering of <hi>George Wiseheart</hi>; for Most did impute the following Calamities to the Death of that Religious Man, especially they, who knew the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Doctrine which <hi>George</hi> held forth, and admired the Unbla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mableness of his Life; and moreover, who look'd upon him as Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely inspired, because of the many and true Predictions which he had made. Hereupon, the Authority of the Regent grew every day less than other; and soon after these, followed another, and that a more spreading, Mischief, which drew a general Complaint, not at all to be hid, against him. There were Juridical Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:56771:282"/>
appointed to be held throughout the whole Kingdom, the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence was, to suppress Robberies, but the Event shewed, that 'twas nothing else, but to cover Oppression, under a plausible Name. For Mony was extorted from all, Good and Bad, as much from honest Men as Thieves, and both were punish'd, not according to great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Crime, but of Estate. Neither could he keep off his Cruelty and Avarice from the Reformed, though he himself had formerly profess'd to be one of the Party, and now he had not the Cardinal as a Blind for his Crimes; yea, the Mony, thus basely got in the Name of the Regent, was as profusely, and unadvisedly spent, by the Lust of his Brother.</p>

               </note>MAtters being thus composed at home, the Queen <hi>Dowager</hi> took up a Resolution to sail over into <hi>France,</hi> partly to visit her own Country, her Daughter and Kindred; partly to secure her hopes in attaining the supream Power, which seemed to be freely cast upon her, and accordingly she chose those to attend her on her Journy, who were Favourers of her Design. For the crafty and ambitious Woman was full of hopes, that the Regent would, by his own Vices, ruin himself, that so she might be advanced in his room; she staid with the <hi>French</hi> King above a Year, in which time, she informed him in the state of Affairs of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who heard her graciously, and, by means of her Brothers, she easily obtain'd of him, what she desired. The King of <hi>France,</hi> the better to bring about his Designs without any Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult in <hi>Scotland,</hi> advanc'd to Honours all those of the <hi>Scotish</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, each Man according to his Degree, who had adhered to the Queen <hi>Dowager</hi>: They also which were of kin to the Regent, were highly advanced; his Son <hi>Iames</hi> was made Captain over all the <hi>Scotish</hi> Auxiliaries in <hi>France,</hi> and a yearly Pension of 12000 <hi>French</hi> Pistols promised him. <hi>Huntly</hi> (whose Son had married his Daughter) was made Earl of <hi>Murray.</hi> Of the Sons of <hi>Rothes,</hi> by different Mothers, who quarrelled about their Patrimony, the youngest, who was Kin to the <hi>Hamiltons,</hi> was made Earl. The King of <hi>France,</hi> by the Advice of the Queen Dowager, sends for <hi>Robert Carnagy,</hi> one of the Regent's Privado's, who was lately sent over by him into <hi>France,</hi> to give that King Thanks for his often As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance of the <hi>Scots</hi> against the <hi>English,</hi> and also <hi>Iames Painter,</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador for some Years in <hi>France,</hi> in behalf of the <hi>Scots,</hi> besides <hi>Gawin</hi> Abbat of <note n="*" place="margin">A Monastery 4 Miles North of <hi>Irwin,</hi> near the <hi>Irish</hi> Sea in <hi>Cuningham.</hi>

               <hi>Kilwinning,</hi> all firm to <hi>Hamilton</hi>'s Faction. He declares to them, what he had before treated with the <hi>Guises.</hi> The Sum whereof was, That the Regent would do the King an accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble piece of Service, if he would give leave to the Queen Dowager to govern, that little time of Magistracy which was left him, which,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:56771:282"/>
as 'twas but a just and equal Request agreeable to their Laws; so, if he complied with him therein, he would take care, that it should not be prejudicial to his Interests; yea, he should find, that by this means he had procur'd to himself a fast and munificent Friend in him: He wishes them to inform him, how he had at present freely, and of his own accord, rewarded some of his Friends, by which he might easily judg, what Courtesies to expect from him for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Thus <hi>Carnagy,</hi> laden with great Promises, was dismiss'd home; and a while after <hi>Painter,</hi> the <hi>Scotish</hi> Embassador, Bishop of <hi>Ross,</hi> was bid to follow him. He, as being a Man of great E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquence and Authority, dealt with the Regent and his Friends, to give up the Administration of Affairs into the Hands of the Queen-Dowager; and, with much ado, he obtained it: So that for his Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and Faithfulness in that Service, the King of <hi>France</hi> gave him an Abby in <hi>Poictou.</hi> The Queen, being now so secure of the Success of things in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and having made sufficient Provision, as she thought, how to deprive the <hi>Scots</hi> of their ancient Liberty, and to bring them <hi>Alamode-a-France,</hi> was accompanied by <hi>Monsieur D'Osel,</hi> as Embassador, to carry things on, a shrewd Man, whose Counsel she was to use in all things; and so she returned home by Land through <hi>England.</hi> The next Year after her Return, she fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Regent, who kept Assizes in almost all Parts of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and so by degrees made the Nobility her own. In this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress, some few Offendors were punished, the rest were fined. The Queen could not approve such Proceedings, and yet she was willing enough to hear them. For she judged, that what Favour the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent lost, it all returned upon Her. In the mean time, having won over the Nobility to her,<note place="margin">The Regent, by Directions from <hi>France,</hi> persuaded to resign his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;</note> she used some Friends to deal with the Regent, that he would freely resign up the Government; his Kindred, upon the view of his Strength, perceived, that his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure was low, and his Friends few, and that he would have much ado to level and clear up his Accounts; for King <hi>Iames</hi> the Fifth, at his Decease, had left a great deal of Mony, Arms, Ships, Horses, Brass-Guns, and abundance of Houshold-stuff (all which he had la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish'd out amongst his Friends in a few Years.) And that his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count would be speedily called for, the Queen being now almost of Age. And if he would extricate himself out of all these Troubles, by quitting the Government, it would be no great Loss; for there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he would but give up the Rule wholly to the <hi>French,</hi> which was intirely manag'd by their Counsels before: And he would have this Advantage also, that by laying down the invidious Title of <hi>Viceroy,</hi> or <hi>Regent,</hi> which however he could not long keep, he would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure Safety and Security to <hi>Himself</hi> and <hi>His.</hi> This Prospect plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, so that an Agreement was made on these Conditions,<note place="margin">Which he doth afterwards, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Terms.</note> That for what Goods of the late King's <hi>Hamilton</hi> had made use of, the <hi>French</hi> King would see, that he should be indemnified, and also that he should be free from any Account, on the pretence of Overseership; only he was to take an Oath to restore what did appear not imbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zill'd, yet in this he did not perform his Promise.

Another Condition was also added by the Suffrage of all the Estates; that, if the Queen died without Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, <hi>Hamilton</hi> should be the next Heir. These were the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Surrender, which were sent into <hi>France,</hi> that they might there be confirmed by the Queen, and some to be <hi>Guarrantees.</hi> The Queen, by the Advice of her Mother, makes <hi>Henry</hi> the 2<hi>d</hi> King of <hi>France, Francis</hi> Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> and Cardinal <hi>Charles</hi> his Brother, the Guarrantees; and the Regent, tho, by persuasion of <hi>Painter,</hi> he had promis'd to relinquish the Government, and the time to do it was at hand, yet when it came to the point, according to his wont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Inconstancy, he was at a great stand; for he began to consider, how grievous a thing it would be for him, to fall down from the Supreme Magistracy to a private Life, for then he should be obno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xious to those, whom in his Government he had wronged: Hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he began to elude his Promise, and to frame Excuses, in regard the Queen was not yet full twelve Years old: Thus, tho those Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations might have been answer'd, yet the Queen Dowager chose rather to retire to <hi>Sterlin,</hi> and there to expect the Expiration of the Set-time, for the giving up his Charge, than to make any Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel about a small matter, tho never so true.</p>
            <p>In this her Retirement, the greatest part of the Nobility came in to her, (Fortune favouring her side,) whom she sought by all means to ingage in her Faction, and those she had ingag'd, she fix'd and confirmed, filling them all with abundance of hopes, and making many Promises in general and in particular, how obliging she would be to them all when she was advanc'd to the Government, which they all knew should shortly follow; she prevailed so much by these Artifices, that only two of the Nobility remained with the Regent, <hi>Iohn</hi> his base Brother, and <hi>Levingston</hi> his near Kinsman. All the rest past over to the Queen. This Solitude of the Regent's Court, and the Fulness of the Queen's, was a Signification to him, how all the Estates were alienated from him, hereupon he repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himself, and was glad to accept of those Terms, which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected before, only with this addition, That the Queen <hi>Dowager</hi> would procure them to be ratifi'd by the Three Estates in the next Parliament, and also by the Guarrantees in <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About the same time, Matters were very troublesome in <hi>England,</hi> by reason of the Death of King <hi>Edward</hi> the 6<hi>th,</hi>
               <note place="margin">K. <hi>Edward</hi> the 6<hi>th</hi> of <hi>England</hi> highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended.</note> a young Prince of high Expectation, by reason of his rare Ingenuity, and Propension to all kind of Virtue, which was both connate with him, and also cultivated by Learning and Study.</p>
            <p>At the beginning of the next Spring, the Nobility assembled at <hi>Sterlin,</hi> where, in a full Assembly, the Transactions with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent were confirm'd, which the Queen and Guarrantees had sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed; this Addition was also made, That the Regent should keep a Garison at <hi>Dunbarton:</hi> and, to compleat all, a Parliament was Indicted at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> to be held the 10<hi>th</hi> day of <hi>April,</hi> then
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:56771:283"/>
next following, where all the Pacts and Agreements approved by the Guarrantees (as hath been said) were produced; and when they were read, the Regent arose, and openly abdicated himself from the Magistracy, and gave up the Ensigns of his Government to <hi>D'Osel,</hi> who received them in the behalf of the Queen, who was absent; and, by command, delivered them up to her, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them by a general Consent; and thus being advanced into the Regent's place,<note place="margin">The Queen Dowager made Regent.</note> she was carried with great Ceremony through the City to the Palace in the Suburbs. And the Regent, who at his Entrance into the Parliament, was attended with a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Nobility, and had the Sword, Crown and Scepter, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried before him according to Custom, now, being degraded, mixt himself amongst the Croud, in the Year 1559.</p>
            <p>This was a new Sight in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and never heard of before that day, that a Woman should be, by the Decree of the States, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to the Helm of Government. Though matters thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to the <hi>French</hi> Interest, yet the <hi>Scots</hi> would never yield, that the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> should be garison'd by them; if so, they feared if the Queen died without Issue, the <hi>French</hi> would then make it the Seat of their Tyranny; so that 'twas put into the Hands of <hi>Iohn Erskin,</hi> as an indifferent Person, who was to surrender it to None, but by the Command of the Estates.</p>
            <p>After this, when the State of the Publick seemed to be somewhat settled, the Queen-Regent (as then she was called) sent out <hi>George Gordon,</hi> Earl of <hi>Huntly,</hi> to apprehend <hi>Iohn Murderach,</hi> chief of the Family of the <hi>Mac-Reynalds,</hi> a notorious Robber, who had plaid many foul and monstrous Pranks: 'Tis thought, that <hi>Gordon</hi> did not play fair in this Expedition, so that when he return'd, without doing the Business he was sent about,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Huntly</hi> impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned,</note> he was kept Prisoner till the time appointed for his Answer; In the Interim, his Kindred excused him, and laid the Blame of the Miscarriage upon the Clanship of <hi>Catan:</hi> thus they spread false Reports amongst the Vulgar, for they gave forth, tho untruly, that the <hi>Macintoshes</hi> had spoiled the Design, by reason of their Animosity against the <hi>Gordons.</hi> This Hatred between these two Clans arose upon this occasion; When the Queen prepared for her Expedition into <hi>France, Gordon</hi> kept <hi>William</hi> chief of the <note n="â€–" place="margin">Or <hi>Macin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toshes.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Catan</hi>-Family, as his Prisoner, a young Man well edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated by the care of <hi>Iames</hi> Earl of <hi>Murray.</hi> There was no Crime prov'd against him, but only because he would not put himself un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Clanship or Clientele; and besides, it turn'd to his Prejudice, that he was of Kin to <hi>Murray,</hi> as being his Sister's Son. <hi>Gordon,</hi> having thus provok'd the Young-man, did not think it safe to vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe him his Liberty, and so leave him behind him, neither could he find sufficient cause to put him to Death. And therefore he, by means of his Friends, persuades the Young-Man, who was not versant in such ill Arts, to commit his cause wholly to him. For by this means, <hi>Gordon</hi>'s Honour, and his own Safety might be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured. <hi>Gordon,</hi> being thus made Master of the Life and Death of his Enemy, dissembled his Anger, and deals with his Wife, to put the Young-man to Death in his absence; for, by this means, he thought to cast off the Odium of the Fact upon her: but it fell out
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:56771:284"/>
quite otherwise; for all Men knew the paultry Disposition of <hi>Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>; and they were as well satisfi'd in the Integrity of his Wife, who was a choice Woman, and had carried her self like a Regular and Noble Matron in all the rest of her Life, so that every Body was satisfied that <hi>Gordon</hi> was the Author of that Counsel to his Wife. <hi>Gordon</hi> being thus in Prison, the Queen Regent's Council were of different Opinions as to his Punishment; some were for his Banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment during some Years into <hi>France</hi>; others for putting him to Death. But both those Opinions were rejected by <hi>Gilbert</hi> Earl of <hi>Cassils,</hi> the chief of his Enemies. For he, foreseeing by the present State of things, that the Peace betwixt the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>French</hi> would not be long-liv'd, was not for his Banishment into <hi>France,</hi> for he knew a Man of so paultry a Spirit, and so revengeful of those who did scandalize or emulate him, would in the War, which the Insolency of the <hi>French</hi> was like speedily to occasion, be as a Firebrand and a Commander for the Enemy. And he was more against his putting him to Death, because he thought no private offence worthy of so great Punishment, as to inure the <hi>French</hi> to spill the Blood of the Nobility of <hi>Scotland.</hi> And therefore he went a middle way, that he should be fin'd and kept in Prison, till he yielded up the Right, which he pretended to have over <hi>Murray.</hi> And that he should suffer all the Royal Revenues, arising out of the <hi>Orcades, Schetland</hi> Isles, and <hi>Mar,</hi> to be quietly gathered by such Collectours, as the Queen-Regent did appoint, and he himself should not meddle with any of the Publick or Regal Patrimony; and likewise surrender up his Presidency over some Juridical Courts,<note place="margin">But released, upon Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> which did bring him in great Profit. Upon these Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he was dismiss'd, and having thus addulc'd the Mind of the Regent, and those that could do most with her, at last he was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the Privy Council.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, all Court-Offices, which had any thing of Gain to move Competitorship, were, by <hi>Gordon</hi>'s Advice, given to Strangers, on purpose that he might breed a Disgust betwixt the Queen Regent, and the Nobility of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and so take De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, though not an honest or creditable one, in their mutual Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test, and destroying one another; and the Earl of <hi>Cassils,</hi> who fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saw this Tempest before it came, began now to be accounted as a Prophet.</p>
            <p>After this, Matters were quiet till <hi>Iuly,</hi> in the Year 1555. and the Queen-Regent having gotten this respite from War, apply'd her self to rectify the Disorders of the State: She went to <hi>Inverness,</hi> and held publick Conventions in the Nature of Assizes, in all accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom'd places, wherein many Disturbers of the publick Peace were severely punish'd; she sent <hi>Iohn Stuart,</hi> Earl of <hi>Athol,</hi> against <hi>Iohn Murderach,</hi> to effect that which <hi>Gordon,</hi> in his Expedition, had failed in. He, besides that Fortitude and Constancy, (Virtues pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to him) was also so prudent and successful, that he took him, his Children and whole Family, and brought them to the Queen. But <hi>Murderach</hi> being impatient of sitting still, or else excited by the sting of an evil Conscience, deceiv'd his Keepers, scap'd out of Prison, and fill'd all places again with Blood and Rapine. The
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:56771:284"/>
Regent hearing of this, was forced to undertake a Voyage, sooner than she determined, to bring him and other Malefactors to Justice; which having done, she returned; and, in a publick Assembly, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored some of those who slew <hi>Cardinal Beton,</hi> that were popular Men, (whom the late Regent had banish'd) from their Exile; by which Fact of hers, she procur'd not so much applause, as she did Ill-will from the many new Taxes she devised. It was thought, that <hi>D'Osel, Ruby,</hi> and those few <hi>French</hi> about the Regent,<note place="margin">The Queen Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, by the Advice of the <hi>French,</hi> raises new Taxes,</note> put Her upon those new Projects to raise Mony, <hi>i. e.</hi> that Mens Estates should be survey'd and registred in Books made for that purpose, and that every one should pay yearly a certain Sum tax'd upon him out of it, into a Treasury to be set apart for that end, as a Fund for War; for, with that Mony, thus kept in a peculiar Treasury, Mercenary Souldiers were to be raised to guard the Borders, and so the Nobility might remain quiet at home, except some great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasion were made by the Enemy, which an ordinary Force could not resist. The poorer sort were much aggrieved at this new pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niary Imposition, and inveigh'd openly against it with bitter Words; but the greatest part of the Nobles kept their Disgust within their own Breasts, every one fearing, that if he should first oppose the Will of the Queen Regent, the whole Envy of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusal would fall upon him, alone. But the next Rank of People were as angry with the Nobles, for betraying the publick Liberty by their Silence, as they were with the Queen; and thereupon about 300 of them met together at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and chose <hi>Iohn Sandeland</hi> of <note n="*" place="margin">In <hi>Mid-Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Calder,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Weems,</hi> out of their whole Body, and sent them to the Queen-Regent, to represent to her the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miny in paying this Tax,<note place="margin">But the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</note> and therefore they desired it might not be sessed nor levied upon them, because of their Poverty, both pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and private; and also to inform her, how their Ancestors had not only defended themselves and their Substance against the <hi>English,</hi> when much more powerful than now they are, but also had made often Inrodes into <hi>England</hi>; and that themselves had not so far de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated from their Ancestors, but that they were willing to lay down their Lives and Fortunes for the Good of their Country, if need required. And as for the levying of Mercenary Auxiliaries, that 'twas a matter full of Danger, to commit the State of <hi>Scotland</hi> to Men, without either Lands or Hopes, but who would do any thing for Mony; and, if occasion were offered, their profound Avarice would invite them to attempt Innovations, so that their Faithfulness hung only on the Wheel of Fortune: but suppose, they were well qualified, and had a greater Love to the Country, than Respect to their own Condition, yet was it likely, nay, was it not incredible, that Mercenaries should fight more valiantly, to defend the Estates of others, than the Masters of them would do, each Man for his own? Or, that a regard to a small Stipend or Pay, which was likely to cease in time of Peace, would raise up greater Courage in the Minds of the Ignoble, than in the Nobility, who sought every Man for his Fortune, Wife, Children, Religion and Liberty? Besides, this Project (said they) concerns the very Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals of the <hi>Scotish</hi> Empire, and 'twas a thing of greater Consequence,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:56771:285"/>
than to be debated at this time, and in this Age of our young Queen; for, if 'twere granted, it could be effected without any Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, yet this new way of managing a War, is both useless, and also much feared and suspected by the most, especially since, out of the Tribute of the <hi>Scots,</hi> Men none of the richest, Mony enough could hardly arise to maintain a Guard of Mercenaries, for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Borders; and therefore 'twas to be feared, that the Event of this Counsel would be, to open the Door of the Borders to the Enemy, not to shut it. For if the <hi>English,</hi> living in a richer Kingdom, should erect a fuller Treasury for that use, there was no doubt, but they might maintain Forces, double to ours with less Grievance to their own People; and then they would break in, not only upon the Borders, but even into the very Body of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. The other part of their Oration, I know not, whether it be not better to suppress in Silence, than to declare it amongst the Vulgar: some Mutterings there were; Who will collect this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny? What great part of it must necessarily be expended upon Distrainers and Treasurers, as a Reward for their pains? Who will undertake that it shall be spent for publick Uses, and not on pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Luxury? 'Tis true, the Probity and Temperance of our noble Princess, who now rules, gives us great Hope, yea Confidence, that no such thing will be; yet, if we consider, what hath been done by others abroad, and by our selves at home, we cannot contain or so govern, our selves, but must needs fear, that what hath <hi>once</hi> been done, may possibly be done <hi>again.</hi> But to let these things pass, which perhaps we have no cause to fear; let us come to that, wherein our Ancestors plac'd their greatest hope of Defence, to maintain their Liberty against the Arms of an overpowring Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. There was no King of <hi>Scotland</hi> ever judg'd wiser than <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> the first of that Name, and all confess, he was the most vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant. He, at his Death, as he had often done in his Life, out of a Prospect to the good of his Subjects, gave this advice, That the <hi>Scots</hi> should never make a perpetual Peace, no nor One for any long time, with the <hi>English.</hi> For he, out of the Wisdom of his own Nature, and also by his long Experience, and Exercise under both Conditions, prosperous and adverse, knew well enough, that, by Idleness and Sloth, the Minds of Men would be broken with De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights and Blandishments of Pleasures, and their Bodies also grow languid; for when severe Discipline and Parsimony is extinct, Luxury and Avarice do grow up as in a Soil untill'd, accompany'd also with an Impatience of Labour, and a Slothfulness, occasioned by continu'd Ease, averse from and hating a military Life; by which Mischiefs, the Strength of Body and Mind, being enervated and weakned, doth abandon Virtue, which is exercised by Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and that a short and unaccustomed Ease and Pleasure is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ballanced by some notable Calamity to ensue.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Upon which, she desists.</note>Upon this Oration, the Queen-Regent, fearing an Insurrection, if she had persisted in her opinion, remitted the Tribute, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd her Error; 'tis reported, she was often heard to say, that it was not Her self, but no obscure Men of the <hi>Scots</hi> themselves, who were the Authors and Architects of that Design: By those
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:56771:285"/>
Words, some thought she meant <hi>Huntly,</hi> a Man fierce of his own Disposition, and newly released from Prison, and, as it seems, more mindful of the Injury of his Imprisonment, than of the respect shewed in his Deliverance. And therefore when he saw, that the Regent was intent upon this one thing, to accustom the <hi>Scots</hi> to pay Tribute, fearing that thereby her Power would increase, and the Authority of the Nobility would be weakned and infring'd; in regard she, being a Foraigner, sought to bring all things into the Power of her own Country-men, it was thought he gave this Counsel to her which suited well with her Mind, as to the raising of Mony, which she was then about; for otherwise, the advice was plainly Destructive, Hostile and Pernicious; for he knew well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, that the <hi>Scots</hi> would not pay such great Taxes, neither would they be as obedient Subjects, as they had been before; some thought, that <hi>David Painter,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Ross,</hi> found out this way of Tax, for he was a Man of a great Wit, and learned besides; he had receiv'd many Courtesies from the <hi>Hamiltons,</hi> and was a Friend to their Family and Designs.</p>
            <p>The next year, which was 1557, whilst the Embassadors of <hi>Scotland</hi> were treating about Peace at <hi>Carlisle,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Embassadors from <hi>France,</hi> desiring the <hi>Scots</hi> to make War against <hi>England,</hi>
               </note> the King of <hi>France</hi> sent Letters to <hi>Scotland,</hi> to desire the Regent to declare War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>England,</hi> according to the League. The Cause was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be, because the Queen of <hi>England</hi> had assisted <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> her Husband, who was ingag'd in a fierce War against <hi>France,</hi> by sending him Aid into <hi>Belgium.</hi> The <hi>English</hi> Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors return'd, without confirming any settled Peace or War either; whereupon the Regent call'd together the Nobility at the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry of <note n="*" place="margin">On the North side of <hi>South-Esk,</hi> near <hi>Dalkeith,</hi> in <hi>East-Lothian.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Newbottle,</hi> where She declar'd to them the many Incursi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the <hi>English</hi> had made upon <hi>Scotish</hi> Ground, what Preys they had taken, and when Restitution was demanded, none was made, so that She desir'd the <hi>Scots</hi> to denounce War upon <hi>England,</hi> both to revenge their own Wrongs, and also, by the same labour, to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist the King of <hi>France</hi>; yet she could not prevail with the Nobility to begin first; and therefore by the advice, as 'tis thought, of <hi>D'Osel,</hi> she brought about the matter another way; She commanded a Fort to be built at the Mouth of the River <note n="â€ " place="margin">The Town of <hi>Eye-Mouth</hi> in the <hi>Merss.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Aye,</hi> against the sudden In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursions of the <hi>English,</hi> wherein also she might safely lay up great Guns and other Necessaries for War, as in a safe Magazine; from whence she might fetch them upon occasion, and so save labour of carrying them from the remoter parts of the Kingdom, whereby much time would be spent; and, besides the troublesomeness of the Carriages, opportunity of Action would be lost. These Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies were visible enough, but she had another Reach in it, she knew, that the <hi>English</hi> would do their utmost to hinder the Work, and not suffer a Garison to be erected under their Noses, so near <hi>Berwick:</hi> Thus the Seeds of War (which she desired) would be sown, and the fault of taking up Arms cast upon the Enemy: And the Event answered her Expectation. For the <hi>Scots,</hi> being provoked by the wrongs of the <hi>English,</hi> whilst they were compell'd to defend their own Borders, easily assented to the Regent's desire, to make War upon <hi>England</hi>; whereupon the Embassadors sent into <hi>England,</hi>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:56771:286"/>
to make a Peace, were call'd back, a Proclamation was made, and a Day appointed for a general Rendezvouz at <hi>Edinburgh</hi>; when the Camp was form'd at <note n="*" place="margin">In <hi>Teviot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale,</hi> on the South side of <hi>Tweed,</hi> below <hi>Kelso.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Maxwel Heugh,</hi> and the Council had not yet decreed any thing concerning the manner of carrying on the War, they, who were forward to gratify the Regent, and to oblige the <hi>French,</hi> ran up and down plundering about <hi>Werk Castle,</hi> scituate in the Borders of <hi>England: D'Osel</hi> had brought some <hi>French</hi> Troops thither,<note place="margin">Difference between <hi>D'O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Embassador, and the <hi>Scots</hi> Nobility.</note> and some Ordnance, as many as he thought were suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to take in the Castle, and he carried them over the <hi>Tweed,</hi> without staying for the Order of the Council, which did highly incense the <hi>Scots</hi> Nobles against him; for, by his so doing, he seem'd to aim at the Vindicating the whole Honour of such an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition to Himself rather than to his Master, and also to make the <hi>Scots</hi> to be obnoxious to, and under, his Command, who were wont to have the chief Command themselves. Thus the <hi>Scots</hi> were mightily offended, that they were so slighted by a private Man, and a Stranger too, so as to be led by the Nose by him, without so much as asking their Opinions, as was formerly wont to be done; so that by doing things of his own Head, without consulting the Nobles, he had arrogated more to himself, than ever any of their own Kings had done.</p>
            <p>Hereupon, the matter was deliberated in Council, where it was unanimously agreed, that they would not venture the strength of the Kingdom against an Enemy, at the humour of every private Person; especially, seeing they were never wont to obey their own lawful Princes in that Case, but after Matters had been open'd and seriously debated in Council, before they were resolv'd upon; and therefore <hi>Osel's</hi> Imperiousness in the Case was nothing else but an Essay,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>D'Osel</hi> vails Bonnet to them.</note> to try, how capable they were to bear the yoke of Slavery; Whereupon, they commanded <hi>Osel</hi> to draw back the Ordnance, and if he refus'd, he should be punish'd as a Traitor. The Queen-Regent, and <hi>Osel</hi> himself, did highly resent this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front; The Regent thought, that her Majesty was impair'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by; and the other, that his Master's Honour (whose Embassador he was) was concern'd: but they being the weaker, were forc'd to yield for the present; and there seemed no remedy to occur, but that the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> who was now marriageable, should marry the <hi>Dauphin</hi> as soon as conveniently it could be effected; for then the Wife, being in the Power of her Husband, the Authority of the Council would be much lessened.</p>
            <p>During that Winter, there were various Excursions made, and with different Success, but One was most memorable at the foot of the <hi>Cheviot-hills,</hi> where a fight was maintain'd a long while, between the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> and <hi>Andrew Carr,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>Scots</hi> under <hi>Andrew Carr,</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown by the Duke of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk.</hi>
               </note> the Victory was a long time doubtful, but at last inclin'd to the <hi>English,</hi> and <hi>Carr</hi> was taken Prisoner, many brave Men being wounded on both sides. Hereupon, an Assembly was Indicted at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> to be held in <hi>October,</hi> to hear the Letters sent from the <hi>French</hi> King. In them, after a prolix Enumeration of the ancient Leagues betwixt them, and their mutual Obligations one to another, he desir'd the <hi>Scots</hi> Parliament, that a choice might be made of fit Persons, out of all
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:56771:286"/>
the Three Orders, with ample Commission, who, in regard his Son, the <hi>Dolphin,</hi> about the end of <hi>December,</hi> was entring upon the Year fit for Marriage, according to the Law, might be sent Embassadors to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the Marriage, which was almost already made, (for the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> had been transported over into <hi>France,</hi> upon that hope) and so the Two Nations, which were anciently Confederate, would now coalesce into one Body; and the old Friendship, betwixt both People, would be connected by an indissoluble Bond. This if they would do, he made them Magnificent Promises, that whatever fruits of Benevolence they did hope for from Allies, the same they might expect from him.</p>
            <p>Tho all the <hi>Scots</hi> knew, to what end this haste of the <hi>French</hi> King was directed, and that there were shortly like to be Disputes between them concerning their Liberties, yet they all came, in great Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to the Indicted Parliament, where, without any much adoe, eight Embassadors were chosen, to go over into <hi>France,</hi> to finish the Marriage: Three of the Nobility, <hi>Gilbert Kennedy</hi> Earl of <hi>Cassils, George Lesly</hi> Earl of <hi>Rothes</hi>; to whom was added, <hi>Iames Fleming</hi> Earl of <note n="*" place="margin">In <hi>Lennox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire.</hi>

               <hi>Montross,</hi> of a Knights Family, but comparable for Dignity, to any Noble Man. After they had set Sail, and were yet on the Coast of <hi>Scotland,</hi> they were toss'd with a very high Wind; and being farther at Sea, they met with such a grievous Tempest, that Two of the Ships were Sunk, not far from <hi>Boloign</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> a Town of the <hi>Morini.</hi> The Earl of <hi>Rothes</hi> and the Bishop of the <hi>Orcades</hi> were carry'd to Land in a Fisher-boat, and were the only Two that escap'd of all the Passengers therein. The rest of the Fleet, having long com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated with the Waves, at length arriv'd in other lesser Ports of <hi>France,</hi> where, when all the Embassadors were again met, they hasten'd to Court. There they began the Treaty about the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; all yielded to it, but the <hi>Guises</hi> were mighty forward to have it hasten'd, both because they judg'd that Affinity would be a great accession of Authority to their Family, as also because oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity seem'd to favour their Design, in regard <hi>Annas</hi> Duke of <hi>Momorancy,</hi> who was esteem'd the wisest of all the <hi>French</hi> Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and who was most likely to oppose the Match, was a Prisoner of War. He indeed was not willing the matter should be so precipitated, as for many other Causes, in the Judgment of many, very just and considerable; so, because the Power of the <hi>Guises</hi> (which was suspected by the Wise, and began to be intolerable to all) might not grow to that height, as to be unsafe for Kings them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.

            <p>The Court, for some time, being transported with these nuptial Revels, when they came to themselves, call'd the <hi>Scots</hi> Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors into the Council, where the Chancellor of <hi>France</hi> dealt with them to produce the Crown, and the other Ensigns of the Kings, and that the Queen's Husband should be created King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> according to Custom. To whom the Embassadors an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd, in short, That they had receiv'd no Commands concerning those Matters. The Chancellor reply'd, That no more was desir'd of them at present, than what was in their Power, <hi>viz.</hi> That when these Matters came to be debated in the Parliament of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> that they would give their Suffrages in the Affirmative, and give it under their Hands, that they would so do. That demand seem'd to be fuller of Peremptoriness than the former, and therefore they thought it best to reject it with great vehemency and disgust. Insomuch that their Answer was, That their Embassy was limited by certain Instructions and Bounds, which they neither could, nor would, transgress, but if they had been left free from any restriction at all, yet it was not the part of faithful Friends, to require That of them, which they could not grant without certain Infamy and Treachery, tho there were no danger of Life in the Case; That they were willing to gratify the <hi>French,</hi> their old Allies, as far as the just Laws of Amity requir'd, and therefore they desir'd them to keep within the same Bounds of Modesty, in making their Demands.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Some of the <hi>Scots</hi> Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors die in <hi>France,</hi> and the rest return home.</note>Thus the Embassadors were dismiss'd the Court; and tho they hasten'd home, assoon as they could; yet, before they went a Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board, four of the chief of them, <hi>Gilbert Kennedy, George Lesly, Robert Reed,</hi> and <hi>Iames Fleming,</hi> all very virtuous and true Patriots, departed this Life, as also did very many of their Retinue, not without suspicion of Poison. It was thought, that <hi>Iames,</hi> the Queen's Brother, had also taken the same Dose, for, altho by reason of the Strength of his Constitution and his youthful Age, he escap'd Death at that time, yet he lay under a dangerous and constant weakness of Stomach, as long as he liv'd.</p>
            <p>That Summer, Matters were at that dubious pass in <hi>Britain,</hi> that there seem'd rather to be no Peace, than a War: For there were Skirmishes on both sides, Preys driven, and Villages burnt; Incursions were mutually made, and not without Blood: Two of the Nobility of <hi>Scotland</hi> were carry'd away Prisoners by the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish, William Keith,</hi> Son to the Earl of <hi>Merch</hi>; and <hi>Patrick Grey,</hi> chief of a Family (so call'd) amongst the <hi>Scots</hi>; the rest of the Military damages fell upon mean Persons.</p>

            <p>This year, and the year before, the Cause of Religion seem'd to lie Dormant, for it being somewhat crush'd by the Death of <hi>George Wiseheart,</hi> one Party accounted themselves well satisfy'd, if they could worship God in their own Tongue, in private Assemblies, and dispute soberly concerning Matters of Divinity; and the other Party, after the Cardinal was slain, shew'd themselves rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute of an Head, than undesirous of Revenge; For he who suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in his Place, did rather covet the <hi>Mony</hi> than the <hi>Blood</hi> of his Enemies, and was seldom Cruel, but when it was to maintain his Licentiousness, and to expend on his Pleasures.</p>
            <p>In <hi>April, Walter Mills,</hi> a Priest, none of the most learned, was yet suspected by the Bishops, because he left off to say Mass; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he was haled to their Court. Though he was weak by Constitution of Body, and Age, extream Poor, and also brought out from a nasty Prison, and lay under such high Discouragements; yet he answer'd so stoutly and prudently too, that his very Enemies could not but acknowledg, That such greatness and confidence of Spirit in such an enfeebled Carkase, must needs have a support from on High. The Citizens of St. <hi>Andrews</hi> were so much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected at the wrong done him, that there was none found who would sit as Judg upon him, and all the Tradesmen shut up their Shops, that they might sell no Materials toward his Execution, which was the Cause of his Reprieve, for one day more than was intended. At last one <hi>Alexander Somerval,</hi> a Friend of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop's, was found out, a naughty Fellow,<note place="margin">

               <hi>Meffen,</hi> an eminent Preacher of God's Word in those days, to come to his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer. There was a great Assembly of the Nobles at the time, so that the Matter seem'd to tend towards a Tumult; whereupon the Process was deferr'd to another time, several were condemn'd, but it was of those which were Absent; who, that they might not be terrify'd with the severity of the Punishment, were commanded to come in by the 1<hi>st</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> and pardon was promis'd them, if they recanted.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:56771:288"/>The same 1<hi>st</hi> of <hi>September</hi> was St. <hi>Giles</hi> day, whom the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> do venerate as their Tutelar God, carousing to him in great Goblets, and making high Entertainments for their Neighbours and Guests. The Regent, fearing, lest in such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd Rable, some Tumult should arise, was willing to be present her self at the Wake. The Papists were very glad of her Coming, and easily persuaded her to see the Show and Pageant, wherein St. <hi>Giles</hi> was to be carried about the City;<note place="margin">St. <hi>Giles</hi>'s Show, the Tutelar of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> fou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly spoiled.</note> but St. <hi>Giles,</hi> alas! did not appear, for he was stol'n out of his Shrine by some body or other. However, that St. <hi>Giles</hi> might not want a Pageant, nor the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens a Show upon such a Festival Day, there was another young <hi>Giles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> (forsooth) set up in his room. After the Regent had accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied him thro the greatest part of the Town, and saw no danger of any Insurrection, she retired, weary as she was, into an Inn to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose her self. But presently, the City-Youths pluck'd down the Picture of <hi>Giles</hi> from the Shoulders of those who carried him, threw him into the dirt, and spoiled the Glory of the whole Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geantry. The Priests and Friars, running several ways for fear, created a belief of a greater Tumult; but when they had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, that there was more Fear than Danger in the thing, and that the whole Matter was transacted without Blood, they crept again out of their holes, and gathered themselves together to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult about the main Chance; where, though they were quite out of hopes to recover their ancient Repute, yet they dissembled Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as if their former Power had remained: And to try how to retrieve their Affairs in so desperate a Case, they sought to strike Fears into their Enemies, and appointed a Convocation to be held at <hi>Edinburgh, November</hi> 8. When the Day of their Convening came, the Priests met in the Church of the <hi>Dominicans,</hi> and there cited <hi>Paul Meffen</hi> by Name, whom in a former Assembly they had commanded to appear;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Paul Meffen</hi> ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished by the <hi>Papists,</hi> but yet harbor'd by the Inhabitants of <hi>Dundee.</hi>
               </note> he, not appearing, was banish'd, and a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Punishment denounc'd on those, who should receive him into their Houses, or supply him with any Necessaries, to support his Life. But that Commination did not terrify the Inhabitants of <hi>Dundee</hi> from doing their Duty, for they supplied him with Provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and harbor'd him from one House to another; yea, and they dealt with the Regent, by some Men who were gracious at Court, that his Banishment might be remitted; but all the Priests mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly withstood it, and besides, they offered a great Sum of Mony to hinder it, so that nothing could be done.</p>
            <p>Whilst these things were acting, some eminent Persons, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of <hi>Fife</hi> and <hi>Angus,</hi> and some chief Burgers of several Towns, travell'd over all the Shires of <hi>Scotland,</hi> exhorting all the People to love the sincere preaching of the Word, and not to suffer themselves, and their Friends of the same Opinion in Religion with themselves, to be oppress'd and destroy'd by a small and weak Faction, alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if their Enemies would transact the Matter by Law, they should easily cast them; but if they chose Force rather, they were not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior to them. And they had Schedules, or writing Tables, ready, for those who were pleased therewith to subscribe their Names:<note place="margin">The first Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of the <hi>Reformed,</hi> in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </note> These first assumed the Name of a <hi>Congregation,</hi> which was made
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:56771:288"/>
more famous afterwards by Those, who joined themselves thereto.</p>
            <p>These Assertors of the purer and Reform'd Religion, foreseeing that Matters would soon come to some Extremity, by joint Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent determin'd to send some Demands to the Queen, which unless they were granted, there was likely to be no Face of a Church; neither could the Multitude be restrained from <hi>Insurrection.</hi> They chose Sir <hi>Iames Sandeland</hi> of <note n="*" place="margin">Or <hi>Cader,</hi> in <hi>Mid-Lothian.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Calder,</hi> a worthy Knight, venerable both for his Age, and for his well-spent Life, to carry their Desires to the Regent, who open'd to her the necessity of sending such a Message, and requested, in the Name of all who stood for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of Religion,<note place="margin">The just Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posals of the <hi>Reformers</hi> to the Queen-Regent,</note> That all publick Prayers and the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of the Sacraments should be celebrated by Ministers in their Mother-Tongue, that all People might understand them; That the Election of Ministers, according to the ancient Custom of the Church, should be made by the People; and That they who presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded over that Election, should enquire diligently into the Lives and Doctrines of all that were to be admitted; and, if by the negligence of former Times, unlearned and flagitious Persons had crept into Ecclesiastical Dignities, That they might be removed out of the Ministry, and fit Persons substituted in their places. The Priests were even mad, and storm'd mightily, that any Man durst to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear and own so impudent a Fact, as they call'd it; but when their Heat was a little allay'd, they answer'd, that they would refer the Matter to a publick Disputation; and indeed, what danger could there be in That, when they themselves were to be Judges in their own Case? On the other side, the Sticklers for the Reformation alleged, That the Matter ought not to be determined by the Wills of Men, but by the plain Words of Holy Scripture. The Priests propounded also other Terms of Agreement, but such ridiculous ones, that they are not worthy of an Answer, as, If the Reformers would keep up the Mass in its ancient Honour, if they would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg Purgatory after this Life, if they would yield to pray to Saints, and for the Dead, that then they would also yield, that they should pray in their Mother-Tongue, and celebrate the Sacraments, Baptism and the Lord's Supper, in the same. The Reformers pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the Regent, (as before) that, in so just a Cause, she would please to gratify them with an Answer, agreeable to Equity and Reason. The Regent favoured the Cause of the Priests, and secretly promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed them her Assistance, as soon as opportunity was offered. And she commanded the adverse Faction to use Prayer, celebrate the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, and perform other Religious Exercises in their Mother-Tongue, but without Tumult, only their Teachers were not to make any publick Sermons to the People at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> or <hi>Leith.</hi> Though this Condition was carefully observ'd by them, yet many Testimonies, that her Affection was alienated from them, did dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear; and the Papists at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> us'd almost the same An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers to the Demands which were brought in by the Nobility, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this they added farther, That as to the Point of electing Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, in such kind of Questions, they were to stand to the Canon-Law, or to the Decrees of the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> Neither did they, in that Assembly, determine any thing in their own Matters,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:56771:289"/>
only they commanded the Bishops to send secret Informers into all Parishes of their Diocesses, who were to take the Names of all the Violators of the Papistical Laws, and bring them in to them; and though they plainly perceived, that their Threats were little estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, yet, trusting to the publick Authority which was on their side, and having Confidence in the Arms of <hi>France,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Which the Priests, by the Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Queen-Regent, oppose.</note> they insulted over their Inferiours as imperiously, as ever they did before. To miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate their Minds in some sort, and to deprecate their severe and bitter Sentence against the Preachers of the Gospel, <hi>Iohn Erskin,</hi> Lord of <hi>Down,</hi> a Man learned, good and courteous, was sent to them; he intreated them, out of that Piety, which we all owe to God, and Charity towards Men, that they would not think it much, at least, to tolerate People to pray to God in their Mother-Tongue, when they were met together for that Service, for That was accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Scripture-Command. They were so far from granting his Request, that they us'd him with more bitter and arrogant Words than formerly, adding also more cruel Threatnings and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches; and, lest they might seem to have acted nothing in that Assembly, they caused some thread-bare Popish Laws to be printed, and fastned upon the Doors of Churches, which, because they were commonly sold for a Groat,<note place="margin">The <hi>Quadranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> or <hi>Triobolar,</hi> Faith, what?</note> the Common People called them the <hi>Quadrantary,</hi> and sometimes the <hi>Triobolar,</hi> Faith.</p>
            <p>Moreover, they, who the Year before, had perform'd the Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy in <hi>France,</hi> came into the Assembly, and easily obtained, That their Transactions should be ratified: And after that, the <hi>French</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador was introduc'd, who, after he had made a long Oration con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ancient and long-continued good Will of the <hi>French</hi> Kings toward all the <hi>Scotish</hi> Nation, did earnestly desire of them all, both singly and jointly, that they would set the Crown (which he, by a new and monstrous Name, call'd <hi>Matrimonial</hi>) upon the Head of the Queen's Husband, alleging, that he would gain but an empty Name, without any accession of Power or Profit; he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so us'd many other flattering Words, not necessary here to be repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which, the more accurate they were in a trifling business, by so much the more they were suspected, as Coverts of concealed Fraud; yet the Embassador, partly by immoderate Promises, and partly by earnest Intreaties,<note place="margin">The <hi>Scotish</hi> Crown order'd to be sent to the <hi>Daulphin</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> who had married the Queen.</note> and partly by the Favour of some, who collogued with the future Power, gain'd the Point, that the Crown was ordered for the <hi>Daulphin</hi>; and <hi>Gilespy Cambel,</hi> Earl of <hi>Argyle,</hi> and <hi>Iames</hi> the Queen's Brother, were chosen to carry it to him. These Persons, perceiving, that they were sent abroad to their own Ruin, in regard the <hi>French</hi> Ambition hung as a Storm rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to fall upon all their Heads, made no great haste to fit up their Equipage, but deferred their Preparation from day to day, until they had ponder'd all things, and taken surer measures of what was likely to ensue, especially since now a nearer and eminenter degree of Honour offered it self. For <hi>Mary,</hi> Queen of <hi>England,</hi> being dead, the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> carried her self as her Heir, and bore the Arms and Ensigns of <hi>England,</hi> engraving the same on all her Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sholdstuff, and domestick Furniture; and though <hi>France</hi> was at that time miserably distressed in asserting their Power and Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:56771:289"/>
over <hi>Milain, Naples</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> yet,<note place="margin">The Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> upon the Death of <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumes the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Arms of <hi>England.</hi>
               </note> she added to the rest of her Miseries this Mock-Title of <hi>England.</hi> The wiser sort of the <hi>French</hi> saw this well enough, but they were forc'd to comply with the <hi>Guises,</hi> who then could do all at Court, for by this vain kind of Splendor, they thought to add much to the <hi>French</hi> Name.</p>
            <p>Besides, the Regent having receiv'd the Decree concerning a Matrimonial Crown, seem'd to have put on a new Disposition, for she turn'd her ancient Affability, which was acceptable to all, into an Imperious Arrogance; and instead of gentle Answers, wherewith before she did addulce both Factions, as, That it was not long of her, but of the Times, that she could not promise so largely as she desir'd, before that Decree was past; now she thought her self cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and therefore us'd another kind of Language and Deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. A Parliament was summoned to be held at <hi>Sterlin, May</hi> 9. and whereas she had often said, that now she was free from other Cares, she would not suffer the Majesty of the Government to be debased, but that she would indeavour to restore it to its ancient Veneration, by some eminent Example. These Words portended a Storm insuing, and therefore many applied to her for her Favour, and, amongst the rest, to make their Request more exorable, upon the account of the Dignity of the Messengers, <hi>Alexander Cuning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> Earl of <hi>Glencarn,</hi> and <hi>Hugh Cambel</hi> Sheriff of <hi>Air,</hi> a worthy Knight, were sent to her. When they came, she could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain her self, but must needs utter this Speech,<note place="margin">The imperious Answers of the Queen-Regent to the Agents of the <hi>Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> with their tart Reply.</note> as a Witness of her Impiety, <hi>Do you, and your Ministers, what you will or can, yea, though they preach never so sincerely, yet they shall be banish'd the Land.</hi> They replied, in great Humility, <hi>That she would call to mind what she of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten promised them:</hi> She answer'd, <hi>That the Promises of Princes were no further to be urged upon them for performance, than it stood with their Conveniency:</hi> Whereupon they rejoin'd, <hi>That then they renounced all Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance and Subjection to her,</hi> and advised her to consider, what Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience was likely to ensue hereupon; she was unexpectedly struck with this Answer, and said, <hi>She would think upon it.</hi> And when the fierceness of her Anger seemed somewhat to abate, it was again kindled much more fiercely, as by a new Firebrand, when she heard, that the Inhabitants of St. <hi>Iohnstons</hi> had publickly embraced the <hi>Reformed Religion</hi>; whereupon, she turned to <hi>Patrick Ruthen,</hi> Mayor of the Town, commanding him to suppress all those Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults for innovating of Religion; his Answer was,<note place="margin">Magistrates have power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Mens Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states, not their Consciences.</note> 
               <hi>That he had Power over their Bodies and Estates, and those he would take care should do no hurt, but that he had no Dominion over their Consciences:</hi> At which Answer, she was so inrag'd, that she said, she hoped none would think it strange, if he were shortly made to repent his stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born Audacity; she also commanded <hi>Iames Haliburton</hi> Sheriff of <hi>Dundee,</hi> to send <hi>Paul Meffen</hi> Prisoner to her, but he was advised thereof by the Sheriff, and so gave way to the Time, and slipp'd out of the Town; she wrote also to the Neighbour-Assemblies to keep the <hi>Easter</hi> following after the <hi>Popish</hi> Manner; but when none obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her therein, she was so inrag'd, that she cited all the Ministers of the Churches of the whole Kingdom to <hi>Sterlin,</hi> to appear there on the 10<hi>th</hi> of <hi>May</hi> ensuing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:56771:290"/>When that Matter came to be noised abroad, the <hi>Evangelicks</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted one another, that they and their Ministers would also ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear at the Meeting, so that there was a great Multitude of those that were likely to be at that Assembly, which though they came unarmed, yet the Regent feared, that things would not go well on her side; whereupon she sent for <hi>Iohn Erskin</hi> of <hi>Down,</hi> who hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to be in Town at that time, and dealt with him to cause the unnecessary concourse of the People to withdraw, which would not be very difficult for him to do, because of the great Authority he had amongst them, and, in the mean time, she promised, she would act nothing against the Men of that Persuasion. Many there were, who being made acquainted with this Promise of the Regent, changed their purpose of going thither, and returned home, yet nevertheless, she, on the day appointed for the Assembly, call'd over the Names of These, who were summon'd, and such as did not answer to their Names, she outlawed: <hi>Erskin,</hi> seeing what lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Credit was to be given to her Promises, and fearing to be seized on by Force, had withdrawn himself, and found the Nobles of <hi>Strathearn, Angus</hi> and <hi>Merns,</hi> yet in a Body, though doubting of the Faith of the Queen: They, finding by his Discourse, (what they suspected before) that the Queen's Rage was unappeaseable, and that the Matter could no longer be dissembled, prepared themselves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst open Force.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> preaches at <hi>Perth,</hi> upon which, the Commonalty destroy the Idols and Shrines for Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Worship.</note>Matters standing in this ticklish Posture, <hi>Knox</hi> assembled the Multitude at <hi>Perth,</hi> and made such an excellent Sermon to them, that he set their Minds, already moved, all in a Flame. After Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, the greatest part of the Audience went home to Dinner, but a few of the meaner sort, such as were also inraged with Anger and Indignation, staid behind in the Church. Amongst them a poor Priest, thinking to try, how they stood affected, prepared himself to say Mass, and drew out a large Frame, or rather Idol-case, in which was contained the History of many <hi>Saints,</hi> curiously ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. A Young-Man standing by, cried out, That what he did, was intolerable, upon which the Priest gave him a Box on the Ear, the Youth took up a Stone, and thinking to hit the Priest, the Blow lighted on the Frame, and brake one of the Pictures; the rest of the Multitude, being in a Rage, some fell upon the Priest and his Frame, others upon the rest of the Shrines and Altars, and thus, as 'twere in a Moment of time, they demolish'd all the Monuments of superstitious, or profane, Worship.</p>
            <p>These things were done by the meaner sort, while the richer were at Dinner; with the same furious Violence, they ran several ways to the Monastery of the Friars, the rest of the common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple still flocking in to them: And though the Friars had provided some Aid against such Assaults, yet no force was able to resist the rash Violence of the Multitude. The first assault was made upon the Idols and the Furniture for their Worship, and then the poorer sort ran into the Prey. The <hi>Franciscans</hi> were furnish'd with Hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdstuff, not only plentiful but stately, more than would serve ten times as many, as they were. The <hi>Dominicans,</hi> though not so opulent as they, yet had enough to evince their Profession of Begging
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:56771:290"/>
to be a very vain one, so that one wittily called them not <note n="*" place="margin">Friars <hi>Mendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants,</hi> call'd Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars <hi>Manducants.</hi>
               </note> Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars <hi>Mendicants,</hi> but Friars <hi>Manducants.</hi> The poor seized on all the Wealth, for they, who had Estates, did so stave off and prevent all Suspicion of Covetousness from themselves, that they suffered some of the Monks, and especially the <hi>Prior</hi> of the <hi>Carthusians,</hi> to depart away laden with Gold and Silver; yea, the Abstinence of the military Men from Plunder was as incredible, as their Celerity in demolishing the Buildings was admirable. For those large Houses of the <hi>Carthusians</hi> were so hastily overthrown, yea, and the Stones carried away, that, within two days time, there was hardly the Sign of any Foundation left. When the Tidings of these Matters were brought to the Queen, with some Exaggerations, they so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed her lofty Spirit, that she solemnly swore, That she would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate this nefarious Wickedness with the Blood of the Citizens, and with the burning of the City. The Inhabitants of <hi>Cowper</hi> in <hi>Fife,</hi> hearing of the Procedure of Affairs at <hi>Perth,</hi> they also, by general consent, either broke the Images, or threw them out of the Church, and thus cleansed their Temple: At which the Parson of the Parish was so grieved, that, the Night following, he laid vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Hands on himself. The Regent was amazed to hear this News, and sent for <hi>Hamilton,</hi> the Earls of <hi>Argyle</hi> and <hi>Athol,</hi> with their Allies and Clanships, to come to her; and though she desired, by her hasty Proceeding, to prevent the Preparations of her Enemies,<note place="margin">The Regent disgusts the Carriages of the Reformed, and prepares Force against them.</note> yet the Carriage of the Brass-Ordnance was so tedious, that it was about the 18<hi>th</hi> Day of <hi>May,</hi> before they came to the parts adjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that City. When the Nobles that were at <hi>Perth,</hi> heard of the Preparations that the Regent had made against them, they also sent Messengers to their Friends, and to the Reformed all about, not to desert them in this last Extremity of Life and Fortune. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, all the Commonalty thereabout came zealously and speedily in, and some also out of <hi>Lothian,</hi> that they might not be wanting to the common Danger. But <hi>Alexander Cuningham,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cuningham,</hi> Earl of <hi>Glen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carn,</hi> stands up stoutly for the Reformation.</note> Earl of <hi>Glencarn,</hi> exceeded them all in his Force and Festination, for he, hearing, how things stood, gathered together 2500 Men, part Foot, part Horse, and led them on Night and Day, through rough and uncouth places, till he came to <hi>Perth. Iames Stuart,</hi> natural Son of the last King, and <hi>Gilespy Cambel,</hi> Earl of <hi>Argyle,</hi> were as yet in the Army of the Regent. For, though they were the chief Authors of Reforming Religion, yet because all hopes of Concord were not quite lost, they staid there: That so, if Peace might be made on just Terms, they might do some Service to their Friends; but, if the Minds of the Papists were wholly averse from Peace, then they resolved to run the same hazard with the rest, at <hi>Perth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Regent, being before inform'd by her Spies, that the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my were above 7000 strong, all very hearty, and resolved to fight, though she had with her almost an equal number of <hi>Scots,</hi> besides the <hi>French</hi> Auxiliaries, yet was loath to venture all upon a Battel. And therefore she sent <hi>Iames Stuart,</hi> and <hi>Gilespy Cambel,</hi> (whom I named before) to treat with the Enemy; They, on their part, chose out <hi>Alexander Cuningham,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Erskin</hi> of <hi>Down,</hi> to treat with them. The Queen was now somewhat more placable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:56771:291"/>
she heard, that <hi>Glencarn</hi> had also join'd his Forces with the rest of the Oppugners of Idolatry.<note place="margin">A Temporary Agreement made between the Regent, and the Reformed,</note> Whereupon the four Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners made an Agreement, That all military Men of the <hi>Scots</hi> should be disbanded on both sides, and the Regent should have Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to enter the Town, and stay there with her Retinue for a few days, till she had refreshed her self from the Toil of her Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; yet so, that they were not to injure any of the Towns-men in the least; as for the <hi>French,</hi> none of them were to enter, or to come within three Miles of the Town; all the other Differences were referred to the Decision of the next Parliament. Thus the present Insurrection being quieted without Blood, the Assertors of the Reformation departed joyfully, for they desired not to make a War, but only to defend themselves; and thereupon they gave God Thanks, who had given an unbloody end to the War. The Earl of <hi>Argyle,</hi> and <hi>Iames Stuart,</hi> left the Regent at <hi>Perth,</hi> and went to St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> there to refresh themselves after their former Toiles. But she, the Volunteers being disbanded on both sides, having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the place with a small Retinue, was honorably received, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Ability of the Citizens. The <hi>French</hi> Mercenaries passing by the House of <hi>Patrick Murray,</hi> an honest and worthy Towns-man, six of them, all levied their Pieces against a Balcony, out of which his whole Family looked to behold the Sight; upon the Discharge, they killed only <hi>Patrick</hi>'s Son, a Youth of thirteen Years of Age: The Body was brought to the Queen, and when she heard of what Family he was, she said, that the chance was to be lamented, and so much the rather, because it lighted on the <hi>Son,</hi> not on the <hi>Father</hi>; but that she could not prevent, nor help, such ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual Acccidents. This her Speech gave all to understand, that she would no longer stand to her Agreements, but till she had Force great enough to her Mind, and her Deeds confirmed the Truth of the Suspicion: For, within three days after, she began to turn all things topsy-turvy; some of the Citizens she fined, others she ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd, and chang'd their Magistrates, without any judicial Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings; and, going to <hi>Sterlin,</hi> she left some mercenary <hi>Scots,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>French</hi> Pay, in the Town to garison it; whereby she pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, she had not broken her Word, which was, that the City should be left free, and no <hi>French</hi> Man enter into it. When 'twas objected to her, that, by the Agreement, all those were to be accounted <hi>French,</hi> who had sworn Fealty to the <hi>French</hi> King, then she had recourse to that common Refuge of the Papists,<note place="margin">Which the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent eludes, what she can, by undue Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences.</note> That <hi>Promises were not to be kept with Hereticks,</hi> but her excuse would have been as honest, if she told them, that she had no Obligation lay on her Conscience, but that she might lawfully take away both Life and Goods, from such a sort of People as they were; and moreover, <hi>That Princes were not to be so eagerly pressed for the Performance of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises.</hi>
            </p>

               </gap> like to be lasting; and besides, the things which followed gave fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occasion to conceive a sinister Opinion of her: For she prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Iames Stuart,</hi> and <hi>Gilespy Cambel,</hi> with threatning Letters, and Commands, denouncing the extremity of the Law against them,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:56771:291"/>
unless they came in to Her: As for the Army of the adverse Faction, she disregarded That, because she knew, it was made up of Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunteers, and such as fought without Pay, and when they were dismiss'd, they would not easily be brought together again. After she had restor'd the Mass, and setled other things, as well as she could, she left a Garison in the Town, as I said before, and went towards <hi>Sterlin</hi>: she was very desirous to have the Possession of that <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Perth.</hi>
               </note> Place, in regard 'twas scituate almost in the Middle of the whole Kingdom, and was the only walled Town therein; and besides, the neighbouring Nobility was averse from the Papists, and therefore she desir'd to put this Curb upon them. Moreover, it had many conveniencies, and especially for conveyance of Land or Sea-Forces, for the Tide comes up thither by the River <hi>Tay,</hi> which washeth the Walls thereof, and so it affords passage for Commerce with foreign Nations, and 'tis almost the only Town, to which access may be had by Land, even from the utmost bound of the Kingdom: As for other Towns, the passages to them are impeded and intercepted by long Bayes, running in from the Sea, and the passage is slower through them, by reason they have not that Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Ships as to carry a great multitude at once; so that oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Passengers are stopt many days by contrary Winds, or by the violence of Tempests.</p>
            <p>For these Reasons, <hi>Perth</hi> is accounted the most convenient Place, for holding Assemblies, and also for gathering Forces from all Parts of the Kingdom. But at that time, the Regent got not so much advantage by the commodious Scituation of the Place, as she reap'd Envy, by violating her Faith, in breaking her Capitulations; for that was the <hi>Last</hi> day of her Felicity, and the <hi>First,</hi> wherein she was publickly contemn'd. For when the matter came to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulg'd, it gave occasion of many Insurrections in all parts of the Kingdom. For the Earl of <hi>Argyle,</hi> and <hi>Iames Stuart,</hi> perceiving, that their Credit was crack'd by the Violation of that Truce, which they were the Authors of, convocated the Neighbour-Nobility at St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> and join'd themselves to the Reform'd, and wrote to their Confederates of the same Sect, that the Regent was at <hi>Falcoland</hi> with <hi>French</hi> Forces, and that she was intent on the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of <hi>Cowper</hi> and St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> and unless help were presently sent, all the Churches in <hi>Fife</hi> would be in great danger. Whereupon,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Argyle,</hi> and <hi>Iames Stuart,</hi> join them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with the Reform'd, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, because of her breach of Promise.</note> a great multitude came presently in to them from the neighbouring Parts, mightily inrag'd against the Queen and her Forces. They thought themselves to wage a War against a faithless and barbarous People, that had no respect to Equity, Right, Faith, Promises, or the Religion of an Oath, but esteem'd so lightly of them, that they would say and unsay, do and undo, at every waving blast of hope, and uncertain gale of smiling Fortune; and therefore, for the future, no Conditions or Articles of Peace were to be hearkned to, unless one Party were extinguish'd, or, at least, Strangers were driven out of the Kingdom, so that they prepared themselves to overcome, or die.</p>
            <p>By these and such like Speeches,<note place="margin">The Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers,</note> the Minds of all present were so inflam'd, that first of all they made an assault on <hi>Carail,</hi> a Town
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:56771:292"/>
scituate in the furthest Angle of <hi>Fife,</hi> where they overthrew the Altars, broke down the Images, and spoil'd all the <hi>Apparatus</hi> of the Mass-Trade, and that which was almost incredible in the Case, Anger prevail'd more in the Minds of the Vulgar, than Avarice. From thence they went to St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> where they spoil'd the Temples of the other Saints, and levell'd the Monast'ries of the <hi>Franciscan</hi> and <hi>Dominican</hi> Friars to the Ground. And though all this was done, almost under the Nose of the Arch-bishop, who had a sufficient Number of Horse, which were able, as his hopes were, to defend the Town; yet, seeing the eagerness of the People, and such a numerous concourse of Volunteers, he withdrew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self and his Followers from the Fury of the Multitude, and went to <hi>Falk-land</hi> to his Kindred and Clans. The Regent was so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd at the hearing hereof, that, without any further Deliberation, she commanded a March the next day, and sent Quarter-Masters before, to assign Quarters for the <hi>French</hi> at <hi>Cowper</hi>; she also sent abroad her Commands to all Places, that all who were able to bear Arms should follow her to <hi>Cowper</hi>; besides, she gave a Watch-word to the present Force of the <hi>French,</hi> and the <hi>Hamiltons,</hi> that they should be all ready to be in Arms, on sound of Trumpet. This Design of hers was made known to the Reformers, by their Spies and Scouts; whereupon, their Friends and Acquaintance were summon'd to repair to those, who were already Assembled; and to prevent the Design of the Regent, they march'd presently to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Cowper</hi>; and at the same Instant, the Inhabitants of <hi>Dundee,</hi> and the Nobles of the adjacent Country, to the Number of about 1000 Men, upon the same Alarum, join'd themselves with them. That night they abode there, but the next Morning early, they drew their Forces out of the Town, and stood in Array in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining Fields, expecting the Army of the Papists, and gathering up their own Forces, as they came gradually and stragglingly in. In the Camp of the Regent, there were 2000 <hi>French,</hi> under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of <hi>D'Osel,</hi> and a 1000 <hi>Scots,</hi> led by <hi>Iames Hamilton,</hi> Duke of <note n="*" place="margin">In <hi>Poictou</hi> in <hi>France.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Chastel-herault,</hi> as he was then call'd. These sent their Guns be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them in the 2<hi>d</hi> Watch, and marching early in the Morning, came all so near, as to see the Enemy, and to be seen by them. There was a small River between them, where, at convenient Posts;<note place="margin">The Queen marches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, and they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare to defend themselves,</note> their great Guns were Planted; 500 Horse were sent before, to make light Skirmishes with the Enemy, and also to hinder their passage over the River, if they should attempt it. The alacrity of these Men gave some stop to the <hi>French,</hi> which was further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd by the coming in of <hi>Patrick Lermont,</hi> Mayor of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> with 500 Citizens in Arms, who, for the conveniency of their March, being stretch'd out in length, made a Show of a far greater Number, than they were: This kept them from discovering the Number and Order of their Enemies, which they much desir'd to know; neither could they discover, the Commanders were at hand, that so they might give Notice to their Fellows, as they were commanded. And therefore, some of the <hi>French</hi> went to the top of an high hill adjoining, that so they might have as full a view of the Enemy, as they could, from such a distance; from thence they
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:56771:292"/>
discover'd many Bodies of Horse and Foot, with small distances betwixt them, and behind them a great number of Baggagers and Waggon-men, which made a long Show, at the edg of a certain Valley; so that they thought, That that whole numerous Party was laid in Ambush for them; and this News they carry'd to their Fellows, aggravating all things beyond what they were, indeed. Whereupon, the Commanders of the Army, by the advice of the Council, sent to the Regent, who staid behind at <hi>Falkland,</hi> to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint Her, how Matters stood, that the <hi>Scots</hi> seem'd more numerous than they expected, and more ready to fight; and, on the contrary, their own Men did grumble; and some of them did publickly give forth, That they scorn'd, for the sake of a few Strangers, to be led to an Engagement against their own Country-Men, Friends and Kindred; Whereupon, by the assent of the Queen, Three Embassadors of the Nobles were sent from <hi>Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> such as had some Friends, or Sons, in the Enemies Army. These Embassadors could not clap up a Peace, because the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers, having been so often deluded by vain Promises, gave no credit to their Concessions; and the Regent, at that time, had not any other Voucher to make good her Stipulation; and if she had, she thought it to be below her Dignity to produce it. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, there was another difficulty in the Case, which was the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion of Foreigners out of the Kingdom, (a thing principally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted upon) and that she could not do, without acquainting the <hi>French</hi> King; so that only dilatory Truces were made, not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline their Minds to Peace, as they had often experienc'd before, but to procure foreign Aid; only this was accorded betwixt them, That the <hi>French</hi> Forces should be transported into <hi>Lothian,</hi> and a Truce should be made for 8 Days, till the Regent sent some Paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficators of her own to St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> to propound equal Conditions of Peace to both Parties. But the Reformers, plainly perceiving, that the Regent did but protract Time, till she passed her Army over the next <hi>Firth,</hi> because then she could not compose things to her own Advantage, the Earl of <hi>Argyle,</hi> and <hi>Iames Stuart,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, under the command of <hi>Argyle</hi> and <hi>Stuart,</hi> take <hi>Perth, Cowper, Linlithgo</hi> and <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and purge them from monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry.</note> dealt with her by Letters, that she would withdraw the Garison out of <hi>Perth,</hi> and leave the City to its own Laws, as she promised, when she was admitted into it, and that the envy of her breach of Covenant was cast upon them, who were the Authors of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement. The Regent, giving no Answer to these Letters, they turn'd their Ensigns towards <hi>Perth,</hi> from whence miserable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints and Groans for Relief were daily brought them. For the Laird of <hi>Kinfans,</hi> a neighbouring Laird, whom the Regent, at her Departure, had made Governor of the Town, to shew his Officiousness, did mightily vex the Citizens; for taking the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of his Command over them, he indulg'd his own private Passions, and reveng'd the old Grudges, which he had with many of them, even to extremity, banishing some, and spoiling others, on the account of Religion; and he also allow'd the like Liberty to his Souldiers.</p>
            <p>The Forces, which were at <hi>Cowper,</hi> understanding of these In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, done to their Friends and Partners in the Reformation, beat
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:56771:293"/>
up a March thither, very early in the Morning, they besieg'd the Town, which, after a few days, was Surrendred to them; <hi>Kinfans</hi> was outed of his Governorship, and <hi>Patrick Ruven,</hi> the old Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, substituted in his Place; afterward they burnt <hi>Scone,</hi> an old and unpeopled Town, because, contrary to their Faith given, they had slain one of their Number.</p>
            <p>By their Spies they were inform'd, that the Regent was sending a Garison of <hi>French</hi> to <hi>Sterlin,</hi> that so they, who were beyond the <hi>Forth,</hi> might be cut off from the rest. To prevent this Design, <hi>Gilespy Cambel,</hi> and <hi>Iames Stuart,</hi> late in the Night, with great silence, remov'd from <hi>Perth,</hi> and enter'd <hi>Sterlin,</hi> where they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently overthrew the Monast'ry of the Friars. They also purg'd the other Churches about the City, from all Monuments of Idolatry; and thus, after 3 Days, they march'd towards <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy'd the superstitious Relicks at <hi>Linlithgo,</hi> a Town in the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; and though they were but a very few in Number, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Souldiers, as if the War had been ended, slipping home to to their domestic Affairs, yet they cut the Combs of the Papists in so many Towns; yea, so great a Terror did seize upon the merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Troops of the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> that they fled, with all their Baggage, which they could draw after them, to <hi>Dunbar.</hi> The <hi>Scots</hi> Nobles, who were the Leaders of the Reformation, staid there several days to order Matters; For, besides cleansing of the Temples from all the Massifying Trade, they appointed Preachers to expound the Word of God, purely and sincerely, to the People.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, word was brought from <hi>France,</hi> that King <hi>Henry</hi> the 2<hi>d</hi> was dead, which News increas'd the Joy, but les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen'd the Industry, of the <hi>Scots</hi>; for many now betook themselves to their private Affairs, as if all the Danger had been over. On the other side, the Regent, fearing lest She, and the <hi>French,</hi> should be expell'd out of all <hi>Scotland,</hi> was highly vigilant and intent upon all Occasions. First, she sent forth Scouts to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> to fish out the Enemies Designs, by whom being inform'd, that the Common Souldiers had disperst themselves, and that the few, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd, kept no Military Discipline nor Watch, she thought not fit to omit such an Opportunity, but march'd with the Forces, which she had, directly to <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> Duke <hi>Iames Hamilton,</hi> and <hi>Iames Douglas,</hi> Earl of <hi>Morton,</hi> very dutifully met Her, but they not being able to compose Matters, only got this Point, That the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict should not begin that Day. At length, after many Conditions had been canvass'd on both sides, on the 24<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Iuly,</hi> in the Year 1559, a Truce was made to last till the 10<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Ianuary</hi>; The sum of the Terms,<note place="margin">A Truce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, and the Reformers.</note> were, That no Man should be compell'd in matters of Religion; That no Garison should be plac'd in <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi>; That the Priests should not be hindred from receiving the Fruits of their Lands, Tithes, Pensions, or other Incomes, freely; That none should demolish Churches, Temples, Monastries and other Places, made for the use of Priests, or should transfer them to other uses; And that the day after, the Mint, for coining Mony, and the Royal Palace, with all the Furniture they found there, should be restor'd to the Regent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:56771:293"/>She was more careful to keep the Articles of this Truce, in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, because She had shewn so much distasteful Levity, in keeping the Pacts, made in former times; yet notwithstanding, She, under-hand, by Men of her own Faction, caus'd the <hi>Scots</hi> to be irritated, who were by Nature inclinable to Passion, and so gave occasion of harassing the miserable Vulgar. But having no colour for her Project, sufficient to disguise her Cruelty, under the pretence of Law, she caus'd false Reports to be spread abroad, That Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion was but made a pretence for Rebellion, but the true Cause of rising in Arms, was, that, the lawful Line being Extinct, the Kingdom might be transferr'd to <hi>Iames,</hi> the late King's Bastard-Son. When she perceiv'd, that the Minds of Men were somewhat possess'd by those, and such other kind of lying, Reports, she sent some Letters to the said <hi>Iames,</hi> pretending, that they came from <hi>Francis</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> King and Queen of <hi>France,</hi> wherein he was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braided with the Commemoration of the pretended Courtesies he had received, and withal was grievously threatned, if he did not lay aside his Design of Revolting, and return to his Duty. <hi>Iames</hi> answer'd thereunto, That he was not conscious to himself, either in word or deed, of any Offence, either against King, Regent, or Laws; but, in regard the Nobility had undertaken the Cause of reforming Religion, which was decay'd, or rather had join'd themselves to those who were <hi>first</hi> therein, he was willing to bear the envy of those Things, if any did arise, which were acted in Common by himself and others, they aiming at nothing therein, but the Glory of God; neither was it just for him to desert that Cause, which had <hi>Christ</hi> himself for its Head, Favourer and Defender, whom unless they would voluntarily deny, they could not surcease their enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize. Setting that Cause aside, he and others, who were branded with the invidious Name of Rebels, would be most obsequious and Loyal in all other Things. This Answer was given to the Regent, to be sent into <hi>France,</hi> where 'twas look'd upon as proud and contumacious, whereas some esteem'd it modest enough, and within compass, especially, as to the Point of upbraiding him which Courtesies, whereas, in Truth, he had receiv'd none, unless such as were common to all Strangers.</p>
            <p>Amidst these things,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>French</hi> Auxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaries arrive, to strengthen the Regent,</note> a thousand <hi>French</hi> Mercenaries arriv'd at <hi>Leith,</hi> and also the Earl of <hi>Arran,</hi> Son to <hi>Iames Hamilton,</hi> late Governor, came to the Convention of the Nobles, which were held at <hi>Sterlin.</hi> The Regent became now cock-sure, upon the Arrival of the <hi>French,</hi> and began openly to apply her Mind to subdue all <hi>Scotland</hi> by Force. But the Cause of the Earl of <hi>Arran's</hi> Return, was this, He was more Eager and Zealous in the Cause of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than was safe for him in those Times, and therefore he was design'd to be put to Death, by the <hi>Guises,</hi> who were the Favorites of <hi>Francis</hi> the Younger, for the Terror of the inferior Orders of Men; yea, the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> was so bold in a Speech, which he made in the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> inveighing against the Cause of Reformation, that, he said, they should shortly see some emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Man suffer upon that Account, who was little inferior to a Prince. He, being made acquainted therewith, and withal calling
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:56771:294"/>
to Mind, that he had, a little before, been free in his Discourse with the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> upon that Head, by the Advice of his Friends, provided for his Safety by a secret Flight; and, contrary to all Mens Expectation, came home in the midst of his Countries Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, join'd himself with the part of the Reformers, procur'd his Father also to join with them, and so he reconcil'd many to him, who had been his Enemies before, upon old Grudges.</p>
            <p>The chief of the Party, there present, being inform'd, That, for certain, some Auxiliaries were arriv'd, and others were levying to be speedily sent over to <hi>Leith,</hi> which was strongly fortifi'd to be made a Magazine for Provisions and Ammunition for War; and, That the <hi>French</hi> intended to make use of that Town, as a Place to secure their Retreat,<note place="margin">Which dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gusts the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</note> if they were distress'd; and as a Port to receive their Friends, if they prosper'd. Hereupon the <hi>Scots</hi> gather'd their Forces together, and indeavour'd to besiege <hi>Leith,</hi> but in vain. For the Regent and the Governor of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> Castle, who had not yet join'd himself with the Reformers and Vindicators of publick Freedom, had the Possession of almost all the Brass-Guns in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>; and besides, the Party had not strength enough, to shut up a Town in a formal Siege, which had the Sea on one side, and was also divided by a River.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the King of <hi>France,</hi> being inform'd, how Matters stood in <hi>Scotland,</hi> sent thither <hi>L'abros,</hi> a Knight of the Order of the <note n="*" place="margin">Or, of St. <hi>Michael.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Cochle,</hi> with 2000 Foot, to assist the Queen in the maintenance of the Popish Religion; There were also sent with him the Bishop of <hi>Amiens,</hi> and 3 Doctors of the <hi>Sorbon,</hi> to dispute matters Controverted, by Arguments, if need were; The arrival of them did so raise up the dejected Spirit of the Regent,<note place="margin">Embassadors from <hi>France.</hi>
               </note> that she solemnly Swore, she would now be speedily reveng'd of God's Enemies and the King's. There were then 12 of the chief Nobility assembled at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> which gave answer to Mr. <hi>D'Labros</hi> and the Bishop,<note place="margin">Their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd by the Reformed.</note> who alleged, they were sent over Embassadors, and therefore desir'd a day to propound their Demands, <hi>viz.</hi> That they did not seek Peace, as they pretended, but that they threatn'd War; otherwise, if it were only to Dispute, to what purpose was it to bring so many arm'd Forces? As for themselves, they were not so imprudent, as to commit themselves to a Dispute, where they must be forc'd to accept what Conditions, their Enemies pleas'd. But if a Pacification might be acceptable to them, they also would take Care, that they might not seem to be compell'd by Force, but over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by Reason; and if they did really aim at what they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, they should send back the Foreign Souldiers, and meet unarm'd, as they had done before; that so the Matter might be determin'd by Equity and Right, not by Force of Arms: This they said to the Embassadors. As to the fortifying <hi>Leith,</hi> they wrote back the Regent, to this purpose;</p>
            <p>That they did much admire, the Regent had, without any Provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, so soon forgot, and receded from her Agreements, as, by driving out the ancient Inhabitants of <hi>Leith,</hi> and placing a Colony of Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers there, and so erecting a Fort over all their Heads to the ruin of their Laws and Liberties, she had done; and therefore, they ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:56771:294"/>
desir'd her, to desist from so pernicious a Counsel, which was temerariously undertaken by her against the Faith of her Promises, against the publick Utility, Law and Liberty; lest otherwise, they should be compell'd to call for the aid of all the People, in the Case.</p>
            <p>About a Month after,<note place="margin">The Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers expostu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late with the Regent.</note> they sent an Answer from a Convention at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> to the same Purpose, withal adding This to their former Requests, That She would demolish all the new Fortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and send away all Strangers, and Mercenaries, that so the Town might be free for Traffick and mutual Commerce, which if She refus'd to do, they would look upon it as a sure Argument, that she was resolv'd to bring the Kingdom into Slavery, which Mischief they would do all they could to prevent.</p>
            <p>The Regent, three days after, sent <hi>Robert Forman,</hi> Principal Herauld, (King of Arms as they call him) giving him these Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, in answer to them. First of all, you shall declare to them,<note place="margin">The Regents answers to their Demands.</note> that I am mightily surpriz'd, and look upon it as an unexpected thing, that any other Man should claim any Power here, besides my Son in Law and Daughter, on whom all my Authority de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends. The former Actings of the Nobles, and these their present Postulations, or rather Commands, do sufficiently declare, that they acknowledg no Authority, Superior to themselves. That their Petition, or rather their Threats, though guilded over with smooth Words, were not at all new to Her. Next, you shall require the Duke of <hi>Castle-herault,</hi> to call to Mind, what he promis'd to me, by word of Mouth, and to the King by Letters, that he would not only be Loyal to the King, but also would take effectual Care, that his Son, the Earl of <hi>Arran,</hi> should not mix himself in these Tumults of his Country; you shall ask him, Whether his present Actings do correspond with those Promises? To their Letters you shall Answer, That, for the sake of the publick Tranquillity, I will do, and so I promise, whatsoever is not contrary to Piety towards God, or Duty towards the King; as for the destruction of Law and Liberty, it never entred into her Heart, much less to subdue the Kingdom by Force. For whom, said She, should I conquer it, seeing my Daughter doth now, as lawful Heiress, possess it. As to the Fortification at <hi>Leith,</hi> you shall ask, Whether ever She attempted any thing therein, before they, in many Conventions, and at length, by a mutual Conspiracy, had openly declar'd, That they rejected the Government, set over them by Law; and, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out her Advice or Notice, though She held the Place and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of a chief Magistrate, had broke the publick Peace, at their Pleasure; and had strengthned their Party by taking of Towns, and had treated with old Enemies for establishing a League; yea, that now many of them kept <hi>English</hi> in their Houses; so that, to omit other Arguments, What Reason have they to judg it lawful for themselves to keep up an Army at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> to invade those who are in Possession of the Government; and yet it must not be lawful for me to have some Forces about me at <hi>Leith,</hi> for my own Defence? Their aim is principally This, to compel Me, by often shifting of Places, to avoid their Fury, as I have hitherto done:
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:56771:295"/>
Is there any mention in their Letters about Obedience to lawful Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates? Do they discover any Way to renew Peace and Concord? By what Indication do they manifest, that they are willing, that these Tumults should be appeased, and all things reduced to their former State? Let them colour and guild their Pretensions how they please, with the shew of publick Good, yet, 'tis plain, that they mind nothing less; for if that one thing were a <hi>Remora</hi> to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, I have often shewed the Way that leads thereto. They them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves are not ignorant, that the <hi>French,</hi> at the Command of their own King, had long since quitted <hi>Scotland,</hi> if their Actings had not occasion'd their longer Stay. And therefore, if now they will offer any honest Conditions, which may afford a probable ground of hope, that the Majesty of the Government may be preserved, and that they will, with Modesty, obey their Superiours, I shall refuse no Way of renewing Peace, nor omit any thing relating to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Good; neither am I only thus affected towards them, but the <hi>French</hi> King is of the same mind too, who hath sent over an Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious Knight of the Order of St. <hi>Michael,</hi> and another prime Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Person, with Letters and Commands to that purpose, whom yet they had so slighted, as not to vouchsafe them an Answer, no, nor Audience neither. And therefore you shall require the Duke, the other Nobles, and Country-men of all sorts, presently to sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate themselves, otherwise they shall be proclaimed Traitors.</p>
            <p>To this Letter, the Nobles sent an Answer the day after, which was <hi>October</hi> 23. to this purpose;<note place="margin">The Rejoinder of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Nobility, to the Regent's Answer.</note>
               <q>We plainly perceive, by your Letters and Commands, sent us by your Herauld, how you persist in your Disaffection to God's true Worship, to the Publick Good of the whole Country, and to the Common Liberty of us all; which, that we may perserve according to our Duty, we do, in the Name of our King and Queen, suspend and inhibit that publick Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration, which you usurp under their Names, as being fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded, that your Acting<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap> are quite contrary to their Inclinations, and against the Publick Good of the Kingdom: And as you do not esteem us a Senate and publick Council, who are the lawful Inhabitants of this Kingdom and Country; so we do not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg you as Regent, in supream Authority over us, especially since your Government (if you have any such entrusted to you, by our Princes) is, for weighty and just Reasons, abrogated by us, and that in the Name of those Kings, to whom we are born Counsellors, especially in such Things as concern the Safety of the whole Common-wealth. And though we are determined to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo the utmost Hazard for the freeing of that Town, wherein you have a Garison, from foreign Mercenaries, which you have hired against us; yet, for the Reverence and due Respect we bear you, as the Mother of our Queen, we earnestly intreat you, to withdraw your self, whilst Necessity compels us to reduce that Town by Force, which we oft endeavour'd to gain by fair Means. And withal we desire, that, within the space of twenty four hours, you would withdraw likewise Those, who challenge the Name of Embassadours to themselves, and forbid them either to decide Controversies, or to manage Civil and Martial Affairs; and also,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:56771:295"/>
that all Mercenary Souldiers in that Town would retire likewise, for we would willingly spare their Lives, and consult their Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, both by reason of that ancient Amity, which hath interceded betwixt the Kings of <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>France</hi>; and also, by reason of the Marriage of their King with our Queen, which doth equita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ingage us, rather to encrease our Union, than diminish it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The same Day, the Herauld also related, that, the Day before, in a full Assembly of Nobles and Commons, it was voted, That all the Regent's Words, Deeds and Designs tended only to Tyranny, and therefore a Decree was made to abrogate her Authority,<note place="margin">They abrogate the Regent's Power.</note> to which all of them subscribed, as most just: Moreover, they did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit the Trust her Son-in-Law and Daughter had committed to her; they also forbad her to execute any Act of publick Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, till a general Convention of the Estates, which they deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to summon, as soon as conveniently they could. The 25<hi>th</hi> day, the Nobles sent an Herauld to <hi>Leith,</hi> to warn all the <hi>Scots</hi> to depart out of the Town within the space of twenty four hours, and to separate themselves from the Destroyers of publick Liberty. After these Threats, Horsemen made Excursions on both sides, and the War began, yet without any considerable Slaughter. In the beginning of this Action, there fell so great and sudden a Terror upon the Cause of the Reformed, which did mightily disturb them for the present, and also cut off all hopes of Success for the future. For the Regent, partly by Threats, and partly by Promises, had wrought off many, who had given in their Names to the Reformers, from the Faction of the Nobles; and besides, their Camp was full of Spies, who discovered both their Words and Actions, yea, those which they thought were concern'd to be kept most secret, to the Regent; and when <hi>Iames Balfure</hi>'s Servant was taken, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Letters to <hi>Leith,</hi> the Suspicion lighted on a great many, and the Fear diffus'd it self over the whole Body: And moreover, the Mercenary Souldiers mutinied, because they had not their Pay down upon the Nail; and if any one indeavoured to appease them, he was grievously threatned by them. But Men did less admire the Sedition of such Men, who had neither Religion nor Honesty, than they did the Imbecillity and Faintheartedness of the Duke of <hi>Castle-herault,</hi> who was so amazed at the Fear of his Neighbours, that his Terror discouraged the Minds of many. Those, who were most couragious, endeavoured to apply Remedies to these Miseries; and their first Consultation was, to appease the Mercenaries: And, seeing the Nobles, which remained, could not make up a Sum suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to quiet and pay them, some declining through Covetousness, others pleading Inability; at last, they agreed to melt down all their Silver-Plate; and when the <hi>Say-masters</hi> were ready to assist therein, the Mints or Stamps, I know not by whose Fraud, were taken away.</p>
            <p>The only ground of Hope was from <hi>England,</hi> which was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judg'd too slow. At last, they resolved to try the Fidelity of their private Friends, and thereupon they sent <hi>Iohn Cockburn</hi> of <note n="*" place="margin">In <hi>East-Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Ormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston</hi> to Sir <hi>Ralph Sadler,</hi> and Sir <hi>Iames Croft,</hi> two Knights of known Valour, (who, at that time, were Officers at <hi>Berwick</hi>) to
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:56771:296"/>
obtain of them a small Sum of Mony,<note place="margin">The Reformers meet with great discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements, by the prevailing of the <hi>French,</hi> and desire Aid from <hi>England.</hi>
               </note> to serve their present Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. This their Design, though they kept it as private as they could, was yet discovered to the Regent, who commanded the Earl of <hi>Bothwel</hi> to waylay him in his Return. He, though in a few days before, he had taken a solemn Oath, that he would not prejudice the Cause of the Nobles in the least; yea, though he had given them hopes, that he would join himself to their Party, yet nevertheless lay in Ambush for <hi>Ormiston,</hi> assaulted him unawares, wounded and took him Prisoner, and so became Master of all the Mony, that he brought: When the noise of this Exploit was brought to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> it alarm'd the Earl of <hi>Arran,</hi> and <hi>Iames Stuart,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all the Horse to draw out, not so much for desire of Revenge, as to free <hi>Ormiston,</hi> (if he were alive) or, at least, to put a stop to their March, that he might not be convey'd to the Regent. But <hi>Bothwel,</hi> having notice thereof by a Spy, prevented their coming by his Flight.</p>
            <p>The same Day, the Governour of <hi>Dundee,</hi> with the Towns-men thereof, and a few Volunteers, marched towards <hi>Leith,</hi> and placed their Ordnance on an adjoining Hill. The <hi>French,</hi> who were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by their Scouts, that almost all the Enemies Horse were ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, drew forth some Troops, to cut off those few Foot, whose Paucity they saw. The <hi>Dundeans</hi> stood a while in hope of Relief, but in regard those few Mercenaries which followed them, turned their backs almost at the first Charge, they also retired, leaving their Guns behind them, until at length a Noise was raised in the Rear, that the <hi>French</hi> were gone another way towards the Gates of the City, to seize them, and so to keep them out; upon this bruit, there was such an universal Perturbation, that every one shifted for himself, the best he could; and whilst each Man endeavour'd to save one, the Weak were trodden under foot by the Strong; so eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry body look'd to his own Particular, and there was no Provision made in common for them all. The Papists, on this Emergency, crept out of their lurking Holes, and did openly reproach them. Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that they, who ever pretended great Zeal for the Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, began partly to withdraw themselves secretly, and partly they consulted, how to desert the whole business.</p>
            <p>On the 5<hi>th</hi> Day of <hi>November,</hi> when News were brought, that the <hi>French</hi> were march'd out to intercept some Provisions, coming towards <hi>Edinburgh</hi>; besides the Disagreement of the Reformed amongst themselves, the Mercenaries could scarce be got out of the Town, to oppose them. The Earl of <hi>Arran,</hi> and <hi>Iames Stuart,</hi> and their Friends went out first against them, with whom there joined many worthy and valiant Persons. They charged the <hi>French</hi> more fiercely than prudently, so that they were near upon the point, to have been shut out from <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and so to have paid for their Rashness. For the Marishes on the one side, and the adjacent Wall of an Orchard, left them but a narrow space for their March, and That also open to the <hi>French</hi> Musketeers; so that they were trodden under foot, partly by their own Men, and partly by the Enemies Horse. In this Trepidation, they had been all certainly cut off, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less the Commanders, leaping from their Horses, had put themselves
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:56771:296"/>
into equal Danger with the rest; some of the common Souldiers, seeing this, stopp'd for Shame, amongst whom was <hi>Alexander Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liburton,</hi> a Captain, a stout young Man, and very forward in the Cause of Religion, he was grievously wounded, taken Prisoner, and soon after died of his Wounds.</p>
            <p>After this Conflict, in which there fell about twenty five, many withdrew themselves, and others were upon the point of Despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; but the Earl of <hi>Arran,</hi> and <hi>Iames Stuart,</hi> promised to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue their Endeavours, if but a small Company of them would keep together; when all, in a manner, refused so to do, the next Consultation was, to leave the City, and, as the Nobles had decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in the second Watch, they began their March, and the Day after came to <hi>Sterlin.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iohn Knox</hi>'s en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</note> There <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> made an excellent Sermon to them, wherein he erected the Minds of many, into an assur'd hope of a speedy Deliverance out of these Distresses. Here it was agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon, in a Convention, that, because the <hi>French</hi> were continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally strengthen'd and increas'd with new Supplies, they also would strengthen their Party, by foreign Aid; and in order there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, <hi>William Maitland</hi> was sent into <hi>England,</hi> a young Man of great Prudence and Learning; he was to inform the Queen, what eminent Danger would accrue to <hi>England,</hi> if the <hi>French</hi> were suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to fortify Places, and plant Garisons in <hi>Scotland,</hi> in regard they sought the Destruction, not of Religion only, but of Laws and Liberties too; and if the <hi>Scots</hi> were overcome by Force or Fraud, yea, if they were reduced to Servitude by unjust Conditions, they would have an easier step to infringe the Power of the <hi>English.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>English,</hi> after a long Debate of the Matter, at length,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>England</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves to send Aid to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </note> gave some hopes of Assistance: Whereupon, the Noblemen, who were the Assertors of Liberty, divided themselves into two Parties; Some abode at <hi>Glascow,</hi> that they might command the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Provinces, and defend their Partners in the Reformation from Wrong; Others were sent into <hi>Fife.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> did what Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief they could to their Enemies; but, being troubled to hear of the <hi>English</hi> Supplies, they endeavoured to subdue the Relicks of the contrary Faction, before their Coming; and first, they marched against that Party which was in <hi>Fife:</hi> First, in their March they plundered <hi>Linlithgo,</hi> and the Estates of the <hi>Hamiltons</hi>; from thence they march'd to <hi>Sterlin,</hi> where they staid no longer, but till they could pillage the <hi>Towns-men,</hi> and then pass'd over the Bridg, and led their Army along the Shore of the River, which was full of Towns and Villages, well inhabited. They ransack'd all they met with, and at last, came to <note n="*" place="margin">A Borough Royal in <hi>Fife.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Kinghorn.</hi> The <hi>Scots,</hi> to stop their Career, put a small Garison into a Town, called <hi>Dysert:</hi> Here the <hi>French</hi> made light Skirmishes for twenty Days together; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they could not wreek their Fury upon the Masters, they did it upon the bare Walls of their Houses, and raz'd a Village, called <hi>Grange,</hi> belonging to <hi>William Kircaldy,</hi> from the very Foundation. He, knowing that the <hi>French</hi> were wont to make often Excursions from thence to plunder the Country-People, a little before day, plac'd himself in Ambush, and observing Captain <hi>L'abast,</hi> a <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyard,</hi> to march out with his Company, he kept himself close so
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:56771:297"/>
long, till the <hi>French</hi> were above a Mile from their Garison, and then his Horse started up, and intercepted them from their Fellows. The <hi>French</hi> had but one way for it, in those Circumstances, and that was to enter a Country-Village near at hand, and so to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to defend themselves behind Walls and Hedges. The <hi>Scots,</hi> being irritated by the former Cruelty of the <hi>French,</hi> were utterly unmindful of their own Safety, while they were intent to attend their Enemies, (though they had no Arms, but Horsemens Lances) yet broke down all which was in their way, and rush'd in upon them; the Captain, who refused to take Quarter, and fifty of his Men, were slain, the rest they sent Prisoners to <hi>Dundee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They who were at <hi>Dysert,</hi> as in a setled Post, met at <hi>Cowper</hi>; out of them and others, that were at <hi>Glasgow,</hi> there were some Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons chosen to be sent to <hi>Berwick,</hi> to agree the Terms of the League with the <hi>English.</hi> The chief Articles were these,
<q>That if any Strangers should enter <hi>Brittain</hi> in a Warlike manner, each of them should aid and assist one another; That the Queen of <hi>England</hi> should pay the <hi>Scots</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> and also the <hi>English</hi> Auxiliaries in <hi>Scotland</hi>; That the Prey taken from the Enemy should belong to the <hi>English,</hi> but the Towns and Castles should presently be restored to the right Owners; That the <hi>Scots</hi> should give Hostages, which were to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in <hi>England,</hi> during the Marriage of the <hi>French</hi> King with the Q. of <hi>Scots,</hi> and if that Marriage were disanull'd, one year after.</q>
            </p>
            <p>These Transactions past at <hi>Berwick, February</hi> 27, 1570. One thing the <hi>English</hi> gave strict warning of to the <hi>Scots,</hi> which was, that they should not join in a set Battel, and so hazard all, before the Aids of their Friends came; for the <hi>English</hi> Nobles were much afraid, that the over-eager Spirits of the <hi>Scots</hi> would precipitate the whole matter into an irrecoverable Mistake.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the <hi>French,</hi> having plundered <hi>Dysert</hi> and <hi>Weemes,</hi> had a Debate among themselves, Whether they should march directly towards the Enemy, or else go all along the Shore to S. <hi>Andrews,</hi> and so to <hi>Cowper.</hi> This later opinion prevailed, because, by reason of the great Snow, which had fallen, all the High-ways were so clogged, that the Horse, without great Inconvenience, could not march thrÃ´ the Mid-land Countries; wherefore passing along a little by the Sea, when they came to the Promontory, called <note n="*" place="margin">In <hi>Fife.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Kincraige, (i. e.</hi> the Head or end of a Rock,) some of them got thereupon, where there was a large Prospect into the Sea, and they came down in great Joy, and told their Fellows, that they discovered eight great Ships, of the first Rate, at Sea; whereupon the <hi>French</hi> did cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly conclude, that those Vessels had brought them over Aid, which they had long before expected; and therefore they saluted them, as the Custom is, with the Discharge of their great Guns, and congratulated one another, invited them on Shore, resolving to pass that day in a great deal of Mirth and Jollity; not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, one or two Boats landed from the contrary Shore of <hi>Lothian,</hi> they (haivng,<note place="margin">A Fleet of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> appear, to aid the <hi>Scots</hi> Reformers, which terrifies the <hi>French.</hi>
               </note> in their passage, had some Discourse with the Passen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, in those Foreign Ships) made a Discovery, that it was a Fleet of <hi>English</hi>; and withal, that the Report was, that the Land-Forces of the <hi>English</hi> were not far from the Borders of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:56771:297"/>
Hereupon, there was a sudden change of Spirit among them, and their unseasonable Laughter was turned into Fear and Trembling; so that presently they catch'd up their Colours, and retreated, part of them to <hi>Kinghorn,</hi> others to <hi>Dumfermlin,</hi> many of them leaving their Dinners behind them, for very haste; for they were afraid<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> lest the Garison, which they had left at <hi>Leith,</hi> might be cut off, and they themselves exposed to the Fury of the Enemy, who lay about them in all Quarters, before they could gather all their Strength into a Body.</p>
            <p>During this whole March, they plundered more of the Papists, who came in thick to them, than of their Enemies. For of them, the richer sort had withdrawn a great part of their Estates into re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote places of Safeguard; as for those, who had not thus secured their Estates, the <hi>French</hi> Commanders being lifted up with their present Success, and also with the hopes of Aid from <hi>France,</hi> which was every day expected, in Confidence whereof they hoped to be perpetual Lords of those Countries; hereupon, they reserved the richest Farms and Villages, which most abounded with all kind of Provisions, unplundered, as a peculiar Prey for themselves. But the Papists were either exhausted by the frequent Invitations of the principal Commanders, to feast at their Houses, under a Pretence of Friendship; or else, were privately pillaged by the common Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers; or, at least, in their Retreat, were openly spoiled by the <hi>French,</hi> who were in great want of Provisions, and that not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out bitter Exprobrations of their Cowardise in Fighting, and their Avarice, in not relieving their Friends, which things (said they) we leave to you to judg, how near a-kin they are to plain Perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness. This contumelious Pride,<note place="margin">The <hi>French</hi> lose the hearts even of the <hi>Scotish</hi> Papists them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, by their Insolencies and Plunderings.</note> joined with the Rapacity of the <hi>French</hi> Faction, quite turned the Hearts of many from them; and not long after, the <hi>Fife</hi> Men, being compell'd, partly by Fear of their Enemies, and partly by the Wrongs received by their own <hi>Partizans,</hi> joined themselves to the Reformers; and, at last, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Countries did universally revolt from the Outlandish, and shewed themselves as eager in repressing the Tyranny of the <hi>French,</hi> as the other <hi>Scots</hi> did in asserting their Religion.</p>
            <p>The Spring was now at hand, and both Parties hastened to draw their Forces together into one place. The Earl of <hi>Martigues,</hi> a stout and noble Young-Man, landed from <hi>France</hi> in two Ships,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>French</hi> Aid ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to assist the Regent;</note> bringing with him about 1000 Foot, and a few Horse; he and his Souldiers presently went on Shore, but the Ships were taken in the Night by the <hi>Scots.</hi> About the same time, the Marquess of <hi>Elbeuff,</hi> Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Regent, who was bringing Aid of Men and Mony in eight Ships, returned back into the Haven, whence he set Sail, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for Fear, because the Sea was full of <hi>English</hi> Ships, and partly excusing himself, for the Badness of the Weather. Moreover, a new Fleet of <hi>English</hi> was sent in to second the former, who flew up and down the whole Chanel, and held <hi>Keith</hi>-Island besieged, stopping all manner of Provision from passing by Sea into <hi>Leith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time, the chief of the Assertors of Liberty, who commanded in <hi>Fife,</hi> went to <hi>Perth,</hi> and after three Days Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence there with <hi>Huntly,</hi> they won over all that Northern part of
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:56771:298"/>
               <hi>Scotland</hi> to their Party; and Order was soon after given, that they should all assemble and rendevouz at the end of <hi>March.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the same time, all the chief Reformers had a Meeting at <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lithgo</hi>; from thence they went to <hi>Hadington,</hi> and, on the first of <hi>April,</hi>
               <note place="margin">So doth an <hi>English</hi> Army, to aid the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers.</note> they joined the <hi>English</hi>; there were in the <hi>English</hi> Army above 6000 Foot, and 2000 Horse: The next Night, they pitched their Tents at <hi>Preston.</hi> The same day, the Regent, to withdraw her self from the Danger now nearly approaching, and to avoid the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain Hazard of War, retired, with some few of her Domesticks, into the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh; Iohn Erskin</hi> was Governour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, a Man of approved Piety and Carefulness, he had received the Command of it, by a Decree of the publick Council, as hath been before related, but upon this Condition, That he should render it up to none, unless by the Command of the same Council. The <hi>French</hi> saw, that the Possession of this Castle was of huge Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to their Affairs, and therefore they used great Endeavours to obtain it by Treachery. The Governour, though he were not ignorant of their Intentions towards him, and had so fortified the Castle, and made such other diligent Provision, that 'twas secure, either from Force or Fraud; yet, was not willing to exclude the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, at such a time; but, in receiving her into the Castle, he took great care, that both she and the Castle might be still under his Command. The Nobles, who were the Assertors of publick Liberty, though before they had often found, that her Mind was obstinately averse against the Cause, which they had undertaken, yet thought it adviseable not to pretermit the present Occasion, as hoping, that the Fear of the War, approaching nearer to her, and the Uncertainty of Aid from a remote Country, might incline her Mind to peaceable Counsels. Whereupon, the chief of the Party had a Meeting at <hi>Dalkeith,</hi> from whence they wrote to her to this purpose;</p>
            <p>
               <q>We have oft-times heretofore earnestly intreated you, both by Letters and Messengers,<note place="margin">The Reformers last Letter to the Regent.</note> to send away the <hi>French</hi> Souldiers, who do yet, another Year, grievously oppress the poor Country-People; yea, they raise up a just Fear in the Commonalty, that they shall be reduced into miserable Bondage; from which Fear, we have many times requested you to free us, but when our just Intreaties prevail'd nothing with you, we were inforced to represent our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable Estate to the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> as the nearest Princess to our Borders, and to desire Aid of her, to expel the Strangers, who threatned to make us Slaves, out of our Kingdom, and that by Force of Arms, if it could not otherwise be done; and though, she, out of a sense of our Calamities, hath undertaken our Cause; yet, that we might perform our Duty towards the Mother of our Queen, and might prevent the Effusion of Christian Blood, as much as is possible, and might then have Recourse to Force of Arms, when we have tried all other Ways to obtain Right without Success, do as yet deem it a part of our Modesty, again to pray you, to command the <hi>French</hi> Souldiers, with their Commanders and Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, to depart immediately out of the Land. In order to the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment whereof, the Queen of <hi>England</hi> will not only afford
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:56771:298"/>
them a safe Passage through her Kingdom, but will also assist with her Fleet to transport them. If this Condition be rejected, we call God and Man to Witness, that we take up Arms, not out of Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, or any wicked Intent, but inforc'd thereto by mere Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that so we may try the Extremity of Remedies, that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Wealth, our Selves, our Estates, and Posterities, might not be precipitated into utter Ruin. And yet notwithstanding, though we, at present, suffer very heavy Pressures, and heavier ones are near at hand, no Danger whatsoever shall ever inforce us to depart from our Duty towards our Queen, or from the King her Husband, in the least tittle, wherein the Destruction of our ancient Liberty, and the Ruin of our Selves, and our Posterity, is not concerned. As for you, most benign Princess, we beseech you again, that, weighing the Equity of our Demands, the Inconveniencies attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing War, and how necessary Peace is to this your Daughter's King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, so miserably harrassed, you would afford a favourable Ear to our just Requests; which if you shall do, you will leave a grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and pleasant Memory of your Moderation amongst all Nations, and will also provide for the Security of the greatest part of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.

            <p>The 6<hi>th</hi> Day of <hi>April,</hi> when the <hi>English</hi> drew near by the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side, about 1300 <hi>French</hi> march'd out of <hi>Leith,</hi> and possessed a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle rising Hill, at the end of the Plain, because they thought that the <hi>English</hi> would pitch their Tents there. There was a sharp Fight for above five Hours, for the recovering and keeping the Place, with no small Loss on both sides; at last, the <hi>Scotch</hi> Horse, with great Violence, rush'd in amongst the thickest Band of the <hi>French,</hi> and drove them back in great Astonishment into the Town; and if the <hi>English</hi> Horse had come in sooner than they did, as 'twas agreed, they had been all excluded from their Fellows, and so cut off.</p>
            <p>After this Onset, there were Conferences managed between the Parties, but in vain, for the <hi>English</hi> did despise all Truce, and ever and anon made some light Excursions, yet not without Blood;<note place="margin">Skirmishes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,</hi> and the <hi>French.</hi>
               </note> 'tis not necessary to recount them. On the 22<hi>d</hi> of <hi>April, Iohn Monluck,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Vallence</hi> in <hi>Savoy,</hi> was first carried into the <hi>English</hi> Camp, then into the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> to the Regent, where he had a Conference with her three Days, and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the <hi>Scotish</hi> Nobles; the Terms of Concord could not, then neither, be agreed on, because the <hi>Scots</hi> persisted peremptori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in their Demand, that the foreign Souldiers should return home. Hereupon, the <hi>English,</hi> because the distance between their Camp and the Town was too great for their Ordnance to do any Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, so that their Batteries signified little or nothing, removed their Camp on the other side <hi>Leith</hi>-River, near the Town, where they might more certainly annoy the Enemy, and also have frequent Skirmishes with him, Hand to Hand. On the last day of <hi>April,</hi> about two Hours before Sun-set, a casual Fire seized upon part of the Town, which, being assisted by the Violence of the Winds, burnt fiercely till the next Morning, destroying many Houses, and
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:56771:299"/>
making a great Devastation, yea, it took part of the publick Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, and consum'd a great deal of Provisions. In this hurly-burly, the <hi>English</hi> were not wanting to the occasion, for they turn'd their great Guns upon that part, and plaid so hot upon the People, that they durst not come to quench the Fire; yea, they enter'd the Trenches, and in some places measur'd the height of the Walls, so that if the <hi>French,</hi> at the beginning of the Combustion, fearing some Treachery, had not run thick to the Walls, and thereby prevented their loss in such a general Consternation, that very day had put an end to the War.</p>
            <p>On the 4<hi>th</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> the <hi>English</hi> set fire to the Water-Mills, which were near the Town; one of them they burnt down before day, the other, the next day after; the <hi>French,</hi> in vain indeavouring to quench the Flames. On the 7<hi>th</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> the Besiegers set Ladders to the Walls to make an Assault, but the Ladders were too short, so that they were beaten off, many wounded, and 160 slain: The three following days, the <hi>French</hi> were imploy'd, with great Labour and Hazard, in repairing the Walls, the <hi>English</hi> continually play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon them where they saw the greatest Numbers. The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists were extreamly puft up with this Success, so that now they promis'd to themselves, that the <hi>English</hi> would depart, the Siege would be rais'd, and the War be finish'd. But the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Scots</hi> were nothing discourag'd by this Blow, but exhorted one another to Constancy, and the <hi>English</hi> promis'd to stay, till they heard their Queen's pleasure from her Court. In the mean time, Letters came from the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> which did mightily incourage all their Spirits. For he wrote to <hi>Grey,</hi> the chief Commander, wishing him to continue the Siege, and that he should not want Souldiers, as long as there was a Man able to bear Arms in his Province, (which was very large, reaching from <hi>Trent</hi> to <hi>Tweed</hi>) and, if need were, he himself would come in Person into the Camp, and, as a sure Pledge thereof, he caus'd his own Tent to be erected in the Camp; and, in a few days, sent in 2000 Auxiliaries; so that the Memory of the former loss was quite worn out, and, with great alacrity they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new'd the War; and from that day forward, though the <hi>French</hi> made frequent Sallies, yet hardly one of them was prosperous to their Party.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the Queen of <hi>England</hi> sent <hi>William Cecil,</hi> a learned and prudent Person,<note place="margin">Embassadors from <hi>England.</hi>
               </note> who was then the chief Manager of Affairs in <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Nicholas Wotton,</hi> Dean of <hi>York,</hi> into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to treat about a Peace; they were commanded to confer Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels with <hi>Randan</hi> and <hi>Monluck</hi> of the <hi>French</hi> Party, concerning Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of Peace. For the Kings of <hi>France</hi> thought it a thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their Dignity, to enter into an equal dispute with their own Subjects. The fame of this Conference was the Cause, that, as if all Controversies had been already decided, a Convention was In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to be held in <hi>Iuly.</hi> In the mean time, the Queen Dowager died in the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi>

               <hi>Iune</hi> 11, worn out with Sickness, and with Grief. Her Death did variously affect the minds of Men, for some of them who fought against Her, did yet bewail her Death, for she was indowed with a singular Wit, and had also a
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:56771:299"/>
Mind very propense to Equity; she had quieted the fiercest High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers, and the furthest Inhabitants of the Isles, by her Wisdom and Valour; some believ'd, that she would never have had any War with the <hi>Scots,</hi> if she had been left free to her own Disposition; for She so accommodated her self to their Manners, that she seem'd able to accomplish all things without Force; but the Misery was, Though the Name of Governess resided in Her, neither did she want Virtues, worthy of so great a Dignity, yet she did, as it were, rule precariously, because, in all Matters of Moment, she was to receive Answers, like so many Oracles, from <hi>France.</hi> For the <hi>Guises,</hi> who were then the powerfull'st in the <hi>French</hi> Court, had design'd the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as a Peculiar to their Family; and accordingly, they advis'd their Sister, to be more severe in as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serting the Papal Religion, than either her own Disposition, or those Times, could well bear. This she gave some evident hints of; for she hath been heard to say, that if Matters were left to her own Arbitrement, she did not despair, but to compose them upon no unequal Conditions. Some others were of opinion, that she alleged those things rather popularly than really, as her Mind was, and that not only with an intent to avert the fault or envy of Mal-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration from her Self; but also, that, under a pretext of asking Advice, she might spin out the time in delay, whilst She sent for foreign Aid; and so, by yielding, she might blunt the vehement edg of the <hi>Scots</hi>; and, in time, suffer their angry mood to abate, in regard, she was of Opinion, that the <hi>Scots</hi> Troops, being Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers, after one or two Disbandings, could not again be easily got together, because they were made up of Men, who were not under Pay, nor under any certain Command. And the Inconstancy of the Queen, in keeping her Promises, was no obscure evidence of this her Dissimulation, for She did not expect the end of a Truce, which, by Conditions, she was oblig'd to do, in renewing a War; but if any specious Advantage were offer'd, she would adventure to do it, Arbitrarily, of her own Head. Others there were, who cast the blame of all things, which were avariciously or cruelly act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or which were attempted by Fraud or Calumny, upon those who were her Counsellors, in managing Affairs. For when She undertook the Regency, at the very First, some <hi>French</hi> Counsellors were join'd to her Assistance, as <hi>Osel,</hi> Embassador of the King of <hi>France,</hi> a Man quickly, and vehemently, passionate,<note place="margin">The Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of the <hi>French</hi> Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors, in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </note> otherwise a good Man, and well-skill'd in the Arts, both of Peace and War; he was one that directed his Counsel rather by the Rule of Equity, than the Will and Pleasure of the <hi>Guises.</hi> One Monsieur de <hi>Ruby</hi> was join'd to him, as his Companion, a Lawyer of <hi>Paris,</hi> who was to dispute Matters of Law, if any such did occur; He, in his pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Administration, conform'd all things, as much as he could, to the Manners and Laws of <hi>France,</hi> (as if That alone were the right Way to govern a Commonwealth) by which means he rais'd a suspicion of Innovation upon him; and though others might share the Guilt of the same Crime with him, yet he alone, in a manner, bore the blame and envy of it. But these Two commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted no Offence, which was remediless and uncurable.</p>

               <note place="margin">Three <hi>French</hi> Generals in <hi>Scotland,</hi> with their respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters.</note>Towards the end of the War, there were three <hi>French</hi> Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, having distinct limits allotted them, who manag'd Military Affairs in <hi>Scotland; viz,</hi> The Count <hi>Martigues,</hi> of the House of <hi>Luxemburgh,</hi> who was afterwards made Duke of <hi>D'Estames; L'abros,</hi> of a Noble, or Equestrian Family, highly experienc'd in Military Matters; and a Third was the Bishop of <hi>Amiens,</hi> accompanied with some Doctors of the <hi>Sorbon,</hi> as if the Matter were to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd by the Pen, not the Sword. All the Counsels of these Three did tend to open Tyranny. <hi>Martigues</hi> his Advice was, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy all the Country near to <hi>Leith,</hi> by Fire and Sword, that so the desolateness of the Country, and the want of Necessaries, might compel the <hi>Scots</hi> to raise the Siege. But if that Counsel had took Effect, many peaceable Persons, poor besides, and, for the most part, Papists too, would have been destroy'd, and the Besieged would have had no benefit neither; for the Sea being open, Provisions might easily have been brought by Ships, from all the Maritim pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> into the Leaguer of the Besiegers, and the devastation of the Land and Soil would have redounded as much on the Papists, as on the Embracers of the True Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>L'abros</hi> was of opinion, That all the Nobility of <hi>Scotland</hi> were to be cut off, without distinction, and that a thousand <hi>French</hi> Curias<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siers were to be garison'd on their Lands, who were to keep under the common Sort, as Vassals. This his Design was discover'd by some Letters of his, intercepted, which were going for <hi>France</hi>; and 'tis scarce credible, how the Hatred against the <hi>French,</hi> begun up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on other Causes, was increas'd thereby.</p>
            <p>As for the Bishop of <hi>Amiens,</hi> he would have had all Those to be seiz'd on, and put to Death, without pleading in their own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, whom he thought not so favourable to the Pope's Cause, as he would have them; yea, all Those, who were not so forward to assist the <hi>French</hi> Party, as he expected; and he mightily blam'd the <hi>French</hi> Souldiers, for suffering those, who were disaffected to their King, to strut it openly up and down; One he particularly aimed at, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>William Maitland,</hi> a Noble and learned Man, whom, because the <hi>Sorbonists</hi> could not refute by their Reasons, the Bishop design'd to take off by the Sword; yea, he upbraided the <hi>French</hi> Souldiers for permitting him to live, and advis'd them to kill him; which he having notice of, took his opportunity to withdraw himself from the <hi>French,</hi> and so escap'd into the <hi>Scots</hi> Camp.</p>

            <p>A Few days after the Death of the Regent, a Truce was made for a short time, to hear the Embassadors,<note place="margin">After the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent's death, Peace conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded between the Parties, by which the <hi>French</hi> were to leave <hi>Scotland</hi>; a point the Regent would never yield to in her Life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, though often press'd thereto.</note> who were come to treat of Peace out of both Nations, <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>England.</hi> Hereupon, the Nobles assembled; These could not effect any thing; the greatest obstacle to an agreement, was, That the <hi>French,</hi> who, the Winter before, had obtain'd great Booties out of the neighbouring Parts, refus'd to depart, unless they carry'd their Baggage, and plunder, along with them. This was denied them; Whereupon, Irruptions were made more fierce than ever, though not so prosperous to the <hi>French.</hi> At length, when both sides were weary of the War, and the Inclinations to Peace could no longer be dissembled, the Embassadors, on both sides, met again in a Conference: The things, which most inclin'd all to Peace were these; The <hi>French</hi> had no hopes of any relief, and their Provisions grew daily scant, and were not likely to hold out long, so that their Condition was almost wholly desperate. And for the <hi>English,</hi> they were wearied out with the long Siege, and wanted Necessaries as well as the <hi>French,</hi> so that They likewise desir'd an end of the War. And the <hi>Scots</hi> too, receiving no Pay, could hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be kept from running away; So that they easily hearkned to a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulation. Thus, by the joint Consent of all Parties, on the 8<hi>th</hi> day of <hi>Iuly,</hi> in the Year of our Lord 1559, Peace was Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd on these Conditions, That the <hi>French</hi> should Sail away in 20 days, with their Bag and Baggage; and seeing they had not Ships enough to transport them all over at present, they were to hire some from the <hi>English,</hi> leaving Hostages, till they were safely return'd; That <hi>Leith</hi> should be render'd up to the <hi>Scots,</hi> and the Walls thereof demolish'd; That the Fortifications lately made by the <hi>French</hi> at <hi>Dunbar,</hi> should be slighted; That these Articles, being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, the <hi>English</hi> should immediately reduce their Forces; That <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> by the consent of her Husband <hi>Francis,</hi> should grant an Oblivion, of all that the <hi>Scotish</hi> Nobility had done or attempted, from the 10<hi>th</hi> day of <hi>March</hi> 1559, till the 1<hi>st</hi> of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust,</hi> 1560. And that a Law should be made to that purpose, to be confirm'd in the next Parliament there, (which was appointed to be in <hi>August.</hi>) And <hi>Francis</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> were to give their Consent to the holding that Assembly. That 60 of the <hi>French</hi> should keep the Island of <hi>Keith,</hi> and the Castle of <hi>Dunbar,</hi> that so, the Queen might not seem to be ejected out of the Possession of the whole Kingdom at once. After this departure of the foreign Souldiers, there was a great Tranquillity, and Cessation from Arms, till the Queen's Return. The Assembly of the Estates were kept at <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> wherein the greatest Debate was, about promoting the Reform'd Religion. The Statutes made were sent into <hi>France,</hi> for the Queen to give her consent to, and subscribe. This was done, rather to sound her Mind, than out of any hope to obtain any thing
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:56771:301"/>
from Her. Embassadors also were dispatch'd for <hi>England,</hi> to give them thanks for their Assistance so seasonably afforded.</p>

                  <hi>Sandeland,</hi> Embassador from <hi>Scotland</hi> to <hi>France.</hi>
               </note>Not long after, <hi>Iames Sandeland,</hi> Knight of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> came unto the <hi>French</hi> Court, a Man as yet free from the Discords of the Faction; his business was, to excuse things past, and to pacify the the Grudges remaining since the former Wars, and so to try all ways to establish Peace and Concord. But his arrival hapned to be in very troublesome times, for the whole Conduct of the <hi>French</hi> Affairs was then in the Hands of the <hi>Guises</hi>; who, when they perceiv'd, that neither Threatnings nor Flatteries did prevail, endeavour'd to oppress the contrary Faction by force of Arms; and when they could lay no other plausible Crime against their Contrariants, they accus'd them of High-Treason, for betraying the Kingdom. Hereupon, the King of <hi>Navarr,</hi> was condemn'd to perpetual Imprisonment; and his Brother, the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> sentenc'd to Death; <hi>Annas,</hi> Duke of <hi>Momorancy,</hi> and the two Sons of his Sister, <hi>Iasper</hi> and <hi>Francis Colignes,</hi> and their Kinsman the <note n="*" place="margin">A <hi>Vidam,</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> is a Baron, holding of a Bishop.</note> 
               <hi>Vidam</hi> of <hi>Charters,</hi> were destin'd to the Slaughter; and besides those, above 7000 more were put into the black List of Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals. Moreover, all means were us'd to terrify the People. The City of <hi>Orleans</hi> was full of Foot-Souldiers, Guards of Horse were posted all up and down the Country;<note place="margin">A Massacre design'd in <hi>France,</hi> by the <hi>Guises.</hi>
               </note> all the High-ways were beset by them; Sentence was past, by a few Men in the Court, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Lives, Fortunes and good Names of the honestest Men; all the Steeples of Churches and Towers round about the Walls, had their Windows shut up, and their Gates and Doors fortified, being design'd for Prisons; Criminal Judges were call'd together out of the whole Kingdom; The manner of Punishment was thus design'd, That as soon as the Frost broke, and the River <hi>Loir</hi> was navigable, the King should go to <hi>Chinon</hi> in <hi>Poictou,</hi> at the Mouth of the River <hi>Vien</hi>; and then the <hi>Guises,</hi> with a few of their Partizans, at the Command of the Court-Cabal, (of which They were the chief) should perform the Execution. Mean while, <hi>Sandeland</hi> came to Court, not so much humbly to desire Pardon for what was past, as to excuse his Country-Men, laying all the blame of the Tumults upon the <hi>French.</hi> The <hi>Guises</hi> receiv'd him very coursly, blaming him, that he, being a Man dedicated to the <hi>Holy War,</hi> had undertaken to manage the Commands of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, upon the Account of that execrable Heresy, which the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of all Nations had highly condemn'd, in the Council of <hi>Trent</hi>; yea, many of them did admire, not at the Folly, but even Madness, of the <hi>Scots,</hi> that they, being but a few, and disagreeing amongst themselves; and besides, destitute of Mony, and other Warlike Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations, should dare to provoke so potent a King, who was now at quiet from any foreign Enemy. Between these fretful Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Threatnings, the King fell suddenly Sick. The Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sador was dismiss'd without any Answer; but the Message of the Kings Death reach'd him at <hi>Paris,</hi>

                  <hi>December</hi> 5.</note> in the <hi>Nones</hi> of <hi>December,</hi> whence he made haste home, hoping for better things for future.</p>
            <p>The News of the King's Death, being divulg'd, did not so much erect the Minds of the <hi>Scots,</hi> being in great Suspence, by reason
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:56771:301"/>
of their imminent Dangers, as it fill'd all <hi>France</hi> with Faction,<note place="margin">The Death of <hi>Francis,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King.</note> and the Poison of domestick Discords; <hi>Iames,</hi> the Queen's Brother, <hi>Scotland</hi> being now freed from the Domination of the <hi>French,</hi> by the Death of <hi>Francis,</hi> made what haste he could to the Queen; who, when her Husband was dead, went to <hi>Lorrain</hi> to her Uncles, either as a Recess to her <hi>Grief,</hi> or else out of womanly Emulation, that she might not be near her Mother-in-Law, who, by reason of the Slothfulness of <hi>Anthony Burbon,</hi> King of <hi>Navar,</hi> did, by degrees, derive the whole Administration of Affairs into her own Hands. There <hi>Iames,</hi> the Queen's Brother, having setled things in <hi>Scotland</hi> for a Season, found her; and, after much Discourse, the Queen told him, she had a mind to return to <hi>Scotland,</hi> and fix'd a Day,<note place="margin">The Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> resolves to return from <hi>France.</hi>
               </note> by which they might expect her, her Uncles being also of the same Opinion: For, before <hi>Iames</hi>'s Coming, there had been great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultation about the Matter, some alleging the Difficulty of the Voyage, especially the Queen of <hi>England</hi> being nothing favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; besides, she was to go to a barbarous People, and naturally seditious, who were hardly kept in quiet by the Government of Men. Moreover, she had fresh Examples, before her Eyes, of her Father and Mother, whom, when they could not, or durst not, openly oppress, by sundry Artifices they drove them to Despair; so that she would be in daily peril, either of her Honour, or of her Life, amongst them. On the other side, they who were skill'd in the Affairs of <hi>Scotland,</hi> did urge, that the Seditions, arising there, were occasion'd oftner by default of the Princes than the People, in that they endeavour'd to reduce that Kingdom to an Arbitrary and boundless Rule, which, time out of mind, had been circumscrib'd and manag'd within due Bounds of Law; and That such a Nation, which was more warlike than opulent, could never endure. But all those Kings, who never attempted to infringe the Liberties of the People, were not only free from private Enemies, and popular Tumults, but also reigned, much beloved of their Subjects, famous Abroad, and unconquered by their Enemies: But the best, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most only Way at present to quiet things, was, to attempt no Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration in the State of Religion, as then establish'd. These were the Debates, as publickly bruited on both sides. But there were other more prevailing Causes with her Uncles; for they, in the Troubles of <hi>France,</hi> cherishing rather great, than honest Hopes, thought, if the Queen were absent, she would be more in their Power, than if she staid in <hi>France</hi>; and that Neighbour-Princes, in hopes to carry her for a Wife, would seek their Friendships, and use them, as Mediators. In the mean time, one or other of their Faction would preside over the Management of Affairs in <hi>Scotland.</hi> Besides, the Queen's Resolution swayed much in the Case, who was determined to return into her own Country; for her Husband was dead; and her Mother-in-Law, (who manag'd Matters of State) being something alienated from her, she saw, she should be cheap at that Court; and tho she had been but a little used to Government, yet a Woman, young, of a flourishing Age, and a lofty Spirit too, could not endure to truckle under another; she had rather have any Fortune in a Kingdom, than the richest without one; neither
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:56771:302"/>
could she hope, that her Condition would be very honourable, the Power of the <hi>Guises</hi> being weakned by the adverse Party, at the first brush: Besides, the Persuasions and Promises of her Brother <hi>Iames</hi> serv'd much to weigh down the Ballance; for he assur'd her, she would find all Quiet at home, especially seeing he was a Man, to whose Faith she might safely commit her self, being her natural Brother, and who, from his Youth, had performed many noble and brave Exploits, and so had got great Credit and Renown amongst all Men.<note place="margin">An Embassador from <hi>France,</hi> with his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and the Answers of the <hi>Scotish</hi> Nobility thereunto.</note> Whilst the Queen was intent on these Matters, <hi>Noal,</hi> a Senator of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> who was sent out of <hi>France,</hi> came into <hi>Scotland,</hi> a little after the end of the publick Convention, and was put off till the next Assembly, which, in order to the setling publick Matters, was Indicted to be held at <hi>Edinburgh, May</hi> the 21<hi>st</hi>; yet the Nobles, who met there at the time, in great abundance, did not sit, because they were as yet uncertain of the Queen's Will and Pleasure. In the mean time, <hi>Iames Stuart</hi> returned from <hi>France,</hi> and brought a Commission from the Queen, giving them Liberty to sit, and enact Laws for the Good of the Publick: Then the <hi>French</hi> Embassador had Audience; the Heads of his Embassy were, That the ancient League with the <hi>French</hi> should be renewed, and the new one with the <hi>English,</hi> broke; That Priests should be restor'd to their Estates and Dignities, whence they had been eject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. To which Answer was given; As to the <hi>French</hi> League, that they were not conscious to themselves, that they had broken it in the least; but that it had been many ways infring'd by the <hi>French</hi> themselves, and especially of late, in their opposing the publick Liberty, and indeavouring to bring a miserable Yoke of Bondage upon a People, which were their Allies, and giving no occasion on their part. As for the League with <hi>England,</hi> they could not dissolve it, without a brand of the greatest Ingratitude imaginable, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compensing so great a Courtesy with the highest Injury, as to join against those, who had been the Deliverers of their Country. As for the Restitution of Priests, they told him, That those he call'd Priests, they knew no use or need of their Office in the Church. In that Parliament,<note place="margin">The <hi>Scots</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishes all Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries.</note> a Statute was made to demolish all the Monasteries of the Monks, and Men were presently sent abroad into all Parts of the Land, to put it in Execution.</p>
            <p>Matters being prepar'd in <hi>France</hi> for the Queen's Journy, her inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Friends, who govern'd her Counsels, advis'd her, for the present, wholly to pretermit and pass over Matters about Religion, though some gave her rash Counsel, to arm on that account, and kill all that opposed. The chief of which were <hi>Dury,</hi> the Abbat of <hi>Dum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fermling,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Sinclare,</hi> lately design'd Bishop of <note n="*" place="margin">A Town built on the River <hi>South-Esk,</hi> in <hi>Angus.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Brechin</hi>; and she her self was by Nature, as also by the persuasion of her Kindred, so inclinable to their Counsel, that sometimes Threats broke out from her, as if it were against her Will, which were catch'd up at Court, and spread amongst the Vulgar: And she would divers times boast, among her Familiars, that she would follow the Example of her Kinswoman, <hi>Mary,</hi> Queen of <hi>England.</hi> Wherefore the Main of her Counsels tended to this, to feed the Men of her own Faction with hopes at present, and to suppress the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:56771:302"/>
opposite Party by degrees; and when she was well setled in her Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, then to declare her mind. And this seem'd not hard to do, seeing the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> was lately begun, on pretence to restore the decay'd Manners of the Church, but indeed, to extirpate the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors of the true Religion, as, by the Decrees of that Cabal, was afterwards declared. Besides, her Uncles did mightily animate the Queen, by shewing her the Power of the Papal Faction, whose Head, by the Decree of the Council, <hi>Francis,</hi> the eldest Brother of the <hi>Guises,</hi> was to be. In the mean time, <hi>Charles</hi> the Cardinal, amidst so many publick Cares, was mindful of himself, and advis'd the Queen, not to carry her Housholdstuff and Furniture, which were of great value, as 'twere, into another World, but to leave them with him, till she might be assur'd of the Event of her Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. She knew the Man and his Craft well enough, and therefore answer'd him, That seeing she ventur'd her self, she might as well trust her Goods as her Person. When all was resolv'd upon, they sent into <hi>England,</hi> to try, how that Queen stood affected to the Voyage; <hi>D'Osel,</hi> the Envoy, was well entertain'd there, and sent back presently into <hi>France,</hi> to tell the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> that if she pleas'd to pass through <hi>England,</hi> she should have all the Respect, which she could desire from a Kinswoman and an Ally; and that she would take it as a great Favour, besides; but if she shunn'd her Interview, she would look upon it as an Affront. For the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Queen had prepar'd a great Fleet, the pretence was, to scour the Sea of Pyrates; but some thought that 'twas to intercept the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> if she adventured to pass against her Will. They took one Ship, wherein the Earl of <hi>Eglington</hi> was, and brought her to <hi>London,</hi> but dismiss'd her again in a little time. But, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Design was, in providing a Fleet, if any Danger was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, Providence did prevent it; for, when the <hi>French</hi> Gallies came upon the Main, a Mist followed them for several days, till they came into <hi>Scotland,</hi> the 21<hi>st</hi> day of <hi>August.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The News of the Queen's Arrival being divulged abroad,<note place="margin">The Queen ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> with vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Descants thereupon.</note> the Nobility, from all parts of the Kingdom, came hastily in, as to a publick Show, partly to congratulate her Return; some also came, to put her in mind of the Services they did her, in her ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, that so they might preoccupate her Favour, and prevent the Cavils of their Enemies: Others came, to give a guess of her fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Regiment, by her first Entrance into the Kingdom: upon these different Grounds, all did equally desire to see their Queen, which was so unexpectedly cast upon them, after such various E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents of changeable Providences. They considered, that she was born amidst the cruel Tempests of War, and lost her Father in about six days after her Birth; that she was well educated, by the great care of her Mother, the choicest of Women; but between Domestick Seditions and Foreign Wars, she was left, as a Prey to the strongest side; and even almost before she had a sense of Misery, was exposed to all the Perils of inraged Fortune: That she left her Country, being as 'twere, sent into Banishment, where, between the Fury of Arms, and the Violence of the Waves, she was hardly preserved. 'Tis true, Her Fortune somewhat smiled upon her,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:56771:303"/>
and advanced her to an Illustrious Marriage, but her Joy was not lasting, but transitory; for, her Mother and Husband dying, she was cast into a Mourning Widow'd Estate, having the <hi>new</hi> King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom she received, and her <hi>old</hi> one too, standing on very ticklish Terms. Furthermore, besides the Variety of her Dangers, the excellent Meen of her Beauty, the Vigour of her adult Age, and the Elegancy of her Wit, did much commend her. These Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishments, her courtly Education had either much increas'd, or, at least, made them more acceptable, by a false Disguise of Virtue, not sincere, but adumbrated only to a kind of Similitude thereof, which made the Goodness of her Nature, by her desire to please and ingratiate her self, less acceptable, and so nipp'd the Seeds of Virtue, by the Blandishments of Pleasure, that they might not come to bring forth any ripe Fruit in their Season. As these things were grateful to the Vulgar, so the more Intelligent saw through them; yet, they hoped, that her soft and tender Age might be easily bettered and amended, by Experience. Amidst these Gratulations, there was a light Offence happened, but it struck deep into the Minds of either Faction. The Nobility had agreed with the Queen, that no Alteration should be made, in point of the Religion received, only she and her Family were to have Mass, and that in private, too. But while the Furniture for it was carrying through the Court into the Chappel, one of the Company catch'd the Torches out of his Hands that carried them, and broke them; and unless some moderate Men had come in, and prevented it, all the rest of the <hi>Apparatus</hi> had been spoiled too. That Action was differently interpreted amongst the Vulgar; some blamed it, as a Fact too audacious; some said, 'twas to try Mens Patience, how far it would bear; others affirmed, and spake it pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly, that the Priests ought to be punish'd with the Punishment, appointed in the Scriptures, against Idolatry. But this Commotion was nipp'd in the very bud by <hi>Iames</hi> the Queen's Brother, to the great, but hidden Indignation of <hi>George Gordon,</hi> who was willing to lay hold on all occasions of Disturbance: And here, thinking an Opportunity was open to curry Favour, he went to the Queen's Uncles, then present, and promised them to reduce all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, beyond <hi>Dunkelden,</hi> to the old Religion. But they suspected the matter, as having heard enough of the Disposition of the Man, and fearing, lest he should raise a new Storm to no purpose, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated the matter to <hi>Iames,</hi> the Queen's Brother. The rest of the Year was spent in Balls and Feastings, and in sending away the <hi>French,</hi> who, out of Civility, had attended the Queen, and were then honourably dismiss'd, only one of her Uncles, the Marquess of <hi>Elbeuff,</hi> staid behind. Amidst these Matters, <hi>William Maitland</hi> junior was sent Embassador into <hi>England,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Maitland</hi> sent Embassador in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>England</hi>;</note> to complement that Queen, as the Custom is, and to acquaint her, how highly she stood affected towards her, and how much she desired to maintain Peace and Concord with her: He also carried to her Letters from the Nobility, in which was mentioned a Friendly Commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of former Courtesies and Obligations; but one thing they ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly desired of her, and That was, that, both publickly and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:56771:303"/>
she would shew her self friendly and courteous towards their Queen; and that being provoked by good Offices, she would not only persevere in her ancient Friendship, but add daily stronger Obligations (if possible) hereunto. As for their part, it should be their earnest Study and Desire, to pretermit no occasion of perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuating the Peace betwixt the two Neighbour-Kingdoms. That there was but One sure way, to induce an Amnesty of all past Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, and to stop the Spring of them for ever, if the Queen of <hi>England</hi> would declare, by an Act of Parliament, firmed by the Royal Assent, That the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> was Heiress to the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> next after her Self and her Children, (if ever she had any.) After the Embassador had asserted the Equity of such a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, and how beneficial it would be to all <hi>Britain,</hi> by many Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he added in the close,
<q>That she, being her nearest Kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman, ought to be more intent and diligent than others, in having such an Act made, and that the Queen did expect that Testimony of Good-will, and the Respect from her.</q>
To which the Queen of <hi>England</hi> answered in these Words,
<q>I expected another kind of Embassy from your Queen; I wonder she hath forgot, how that, before her Departure out of <hi>France,</hi> after much urging, she at last promised, that the League, made at <hi>Leith,</hi> should be confirmed,<note place="margin">Who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suades Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> by many Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> her Successor.</note> she having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised me faithfully it should be so, as soon as ever she returned into her own Country. I have been put off with Words long enough; now 'tis time, (if she have any respect to her Honour) that her Deeds should answer her Words.</q>
To which the Embassador an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
<q>That he was sent in this Embassy, but a very few days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Queen's Arrival, before she had entred upon the Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any publick Affairs; That she had been hitherto taken up in treating the Nobility, many of whom she had never seen before, who came from divers parts to perform their dutiful Salutations to her; but she was chiefly imployed about setling the State of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which, how difficult and troublesome a thing it is, (said he) you your self are not ignorant: Hence, (he proceeded) your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty may easily understand, that the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> had no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant time at all before my Departure; neither had she as yet called fit Men to her Council, to consult about various Affairs; especially, since the Nobility, that liv'd in the furthest parts towards the North, had not been yet to attend her, before his Coming, without whose advice, Matters of such publick Moment, could not, nor ought not, to be transacted.</q>
Upon which the <hi>English</hi> Queen was something moved, and said,
<q>What need had your Queen to make any Consultation about doing that, which she hath obliged her self to under her Hand and Seal? He replied, I can give no other Answer at present, for I received nothing in command about it, neither did our Queen expect, that an account thereof would now be required of me; and you may easily consider with your self, what just causes of Delay, she, at present, lies under.</q>
After some Words had past betwixt them, upon these matters, the Queen returned to the main Point,
<q>I observe, said she, what you most insist upon, in behalf of your Queen, and in seconding the Requests of the Nobles, you put me in Mind, that your Queen is descended
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:56771:304"/>
from the Blood of the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> and that I am bound to love her by a natural Obligation, as being my near Kinswoman, which I neither can, or will, deny; I have also made it evident to the whole World, that, in all my Actions, I never attempted any thing against the Weal and Tranquillity of her self and her King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: Those, who are acquainted with my inward Thoughts and Inclinations, are conscious, that though I had just cause of Offence given, by her using my Arms, and claiming a Title to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, yet I could never be persuaded, but that these Seeds of Hatred came from others, not from her self. However the case stands, I hope, she will not take away my Crown whilst I am alive, nor hinder my Children (if I have any) to succeed me in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: But if any Casualty should happen to me before, she shall never find, that I have done any thing, which may, in the least, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice the Right she pretends to have to the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi>; what that Right is, I never thought my self obliged to make a strict Disquisition into, and I am of the same Mind still, I leave it to those who are skilful in the Law to determine. As for your Queen, she may expect this confidently of me, that if her Cause be just, I shall not prejudice it in the least; I call God to witness, that next to my self, I know none that I would prefer before her; or if the matter come to a Dispute, that can exclude her: Thou knowest, says she, who are the Competitors: By what Assistance, or in hopes of what Force, can such poor Creatures, attempt such a mighty thing?</q>
After some further Discourse, the Conclusion was short,
<q>That it was a matter of great Weight and Moment, and that this was the first time, she had entertained any serious Thoughts about it, and therefore she had need of longer time to dispatch it.</q>
A few days after, she sent for the Embassador again; and told him,</p>
            <q>
               <p>That she extreamly wondred, Why the Nobles should demand such a thing of her, upon the first Arrival of the Queen, especially, knowing, that the Causes of former Offences were not yet taken away: But what, pray, do they require? That I, having been so much wrong'd, should, before any Satisfaction receiv'd, gratify her in so great a matter. This Demand is not far from a Threat: If they proceed on in this way, let them know, that I have Force at home, and Friends abroad, as well as They, who will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend my just Right. To which he answered, That he had shewn clearly, at first, how that the Nobility had insisted on this hopeful <hi>Medium</hi> of Concord, partly out of Duty to their Queen, in a Prospect to maintain her Weal, and increase her Dignity; partly out of a Desire, to conciliate and settle publick Peace and Amity. And, that they deal more plainly with you, than with any other Prince, in this Cause, proceeds from your known and experienc'd Good-Will towards them, and also upon the account of their own Safety; for, they knew they must venture Life and Fortune, if any Body did oppose the Right of the Queen, or any War should a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise betwixt the Nations, on that ground. And therefore their Desires did not seem unwarrantable or unjust, as tending to the era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicating the Seeds of all Discords, and the settling a firm and solid Peace. She rejoined, If I had acted any thing which might dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:56771:304"/>
your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>. However, I take not the good Intention of your Nobility <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
                  </gap>, and the rather, because 'tis an Evidence to me, that they have a Desire to promote the Interest and Honour of their Queen; and I do put as great Value on their Prudence, in providing for their own Security, and in being tender of shedding Christian Blood, which could not be avoided, if any Faction should arise to challenge the Kingdom; But what such Party can there be, or where should they have Force? But to let these Considerations pass, suppose me inclinable to assent to their Demands, do you think, I would do it, rather at the Request of the Nobles, than of the Queen her self?</p>
               <p>But there are many other things, which avert me from such a Transaction. First, I am not ignorant, how dangerous a thing 'tis, to venture on the Dispute. The Disceptation concerning the Right of the Kingdom, I have always mightily avoided; for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy hath been already so much canvass'd in the Mouths of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, concerning a just and lawful Marriage, and what Children were Bastards, and what Legitimate, according as every one is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to this or that Party, that, by reason of these Disputes, I have hitherto been more backward in marrying. Once, when I took the Crown publickly upon me, I married my self to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and I wear the Ring, I then put on my Finger, as a Badg thereof; however, my Resolution stands, <hi>I will be Queen of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>as long as I live.</hi> And when I am dead, let that Person suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in my place, which hath most Right to it; and if That chance to be your Queen, I will put no Obstacle in her way; but if ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath a better Title, 'twere unjust to require of me, to make a publick Edict to his Prejudice. If there be any Law against your Queen, 'tis unknown to me, and I have no great Delight to sift into it; but if there should be any such Law, I was sworn at my Coronation, that I would not change my Subjects Laws. As for your second Allegation, That the Declaration of my Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor will knit a stricter Bond of Amity betwixt us, I am afraid rather, it will be a Seminary of Hatred and Discontent; What, do you think I am willing to have my Grave-Clothes always before my Eyes? Kings have this Peculiarity, that they have some kind of Sentiments against the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
                  </gap> own Children, who are born lawful Heirs to succeed them. Thus <hi>Charles</hi> the 7<hi>th</hi> of <hi>France</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what disgusted <hi>Lewis</hi> the 11<hi>th</hi>; and <hi>Lewis</hi> the 3<hi>d, Charles</hi> the 8<hi>th</hi>; and of late, <hi>Francis</hi> ill-resented <hi>Henry.</hi> And, how is it likely, I should stand affected towards my Kinswoman, if she be once declared my Heir? Just as <hi>Charles</hi> the 7<hi>th</hi> was towards <hi>Lewis</hi> the 11<hi>th.</hi> Besides, and that which weighs most with me, I know the Inconstancy of this People; I know, how they loath the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent State of things; I know, how intent their Eyes are upon a Successor. 'Tis natural for all Men, as the Proverb is, <hi>to worship rather the rising, than the setting Sun:</hi> I have learn'd, That from my own Times, to omit other Examples; when my Sister <hi>Mary</hi>
                  <pb n="158" facs="tcp:56771:305"/>
sat at <hi>Helm,</hi> how eagerly did some Men desire to see Me plac'd in the Throne? how Solicitous were they in advancing Me thereto: I am not Ignorant, what Danger they would have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone, to bring their Design to an Issue, if my Will had concurr'd with their Desires: Now, perhaps, the same Men are otherwise minded; just like Children, when they dream of Apples in their Sleep, they are very joyful; but, waking in the Morning, and finding themselves frustrate of their hopes, their Mirth is turn'd into Mourning. Thus I am dealt with by Those, who, whilst yet I was a private Woman, wish'd Me so well: If I look'd upon any of Them a little more pleasantly than ordinary, they thought presently with themselves, that, as soon as ever I came to the Throne, they should be rewarded rather at the Rate of their own Desires,<note place="margin">Courtiers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable, and selfish, in their Affections to their Prince.</note> than of the Service they perform'd for Me; but now, seeing the Event hath not answer'd Expectation, some of them do gape after a new change of Things, in hope of a better Fortune. For the Wealth of a Prince, though never so great, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not satisfy the unsatiable desires of all Men. But if the Good-will of my Subjects do flag towards Me; or, if their Minds are chang'd, because I am not profuse enough in my Largesses; or, for some other trivial Cause, what will be the Event, when the Malevolent shall have a Successor nam'd, to whom they may make their Grievances known, and, in their Anger and Pet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take themselves? What danger shall I then be in, when so power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a Neighbour-Prince is my Successor? The more Strength I add to her in ascertaining her Succession, the more I detract from my own Security; This Danger cannot be avoided by any Precautions, or by any Bonds of Law; yea, those Princes, who have hope of a Kingdom offer'd them, will hardly contain themselves within the Bounds either of Law or Equity. For my part, if my Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor were publickly declar'd to the World, I should think my Affairs to be far from being setled and secure.</p>
            </q>
            <p>This was the Sum of what was truly acted at that Conference.</p>
            <p>A few days after, the Embassador ask'd the Queen, Whether she would return any Answer to the Letter of the <hi>Scotish</hi> Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity?
<q>I have nothing, said She, at present to Answer, only I commend their Sedulity and Love to their Prince; but the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is of such great weight, that I cannot so soon give a plain and express Answer thereunto; but, when your Queen shall have done her Duty, in confirming the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>eague she oblig'd her Self to ratify, then 'twill be seasonable, to try my Affection towards Her. In the mean time, I cannot gratify her in her Request, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diminution of my own Dignity. The Embassador reply'd, He had no Command about that Affair, nor ever had any discourse, with his Mistress concerning it, neither did he then propound the Queen's Judgment concerning the Right of Succession, but his Own, and had brought Reasons to inforce it; but, as for the Confirmation of the League by her Husband, 'twas inforc'd from the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> without the consent of Those, whom the ratifying or disanulling thereof, did much concern; neither was it a thing of such Consequence, as therefore to exclude Her,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:56771:305"/>
and her Posterity, from the Inheritance of <hi>England</hi>; I do not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, said he, by Whom, When, How, by What Authority, and for What Reason, that League was made, seeing I had no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to speak of any such Matter. But this I dare affirm, That though 'twere confirm'd by Her, in compliance with her Husband's desire, yet, so great a stress depending on it, his Queen, in time, would find out some Reason or other, why it should, and ought, to be dissolv'd; I speak not this (said he) in the Name of the Queen, but my intent is to shew, that our Nobility have cause for what they do, that so, all Controversies being pluckt up by the Roots, a firm and sure Peace may be establisht betwixt us.</q>
            </p>
            <p>After much discourse, <hi>Pro</hi> and <hi>Con,</hi> about the League, the Queen was brought to this, That Embassadors should be chosen on both sides to review it, and to regulate it, according to this Form, That the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> should abstain from using the Arms of <hi>England,</hi> and from the Titles of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> not to use the <hi>English</hi> Arms, in Queen <hi>Elizabeth's</hi> time.</note> as long as the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> or any of her Children, were alive. On the other side, the Queen of <hi>England</hi> was to do nothing, neither by her Self, nor her Posterity, which might prejudice the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> or impair her Right of Succession. These were the Affairs transacted in this Embassy; which, while they were treated of abroad, in order to settle Peace, Sedition had almost broke out at home. There was Mass allow'd to the Queen and her Family, (as I said before) concerning which, when the Edict was publish'd, there was one of the Nobility which oppos'd it, <hi>viz.</hi> the Earl of <hi>Arran</hi>; the Queen being much offended thereat, tho she dissembled her Anger. The next offence was, against the <hi>Edinburgers,</hi> they use ordinarily to chuse their Magistrates, <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember</hi> 29; at that time, <hi>Archibald Douglas,</hi> the Sheriff, according to Custom, Proclaim'd, That no Adulterer, Fornicator, Drunkard, Mass-Monger, yea, or obstinate Papists, after the First of <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> should stay in the Town, great Penalties being denounc'd against the Disobeyers thereof. When the Queen was inform'd hereof, she committed the Magistrates to Prison, without hearing them, and commanded the Citizens to chuse new Magistrates, injoining them to set the Gates open to all her good Subjects, not without the secret Indignation, and Laughter, of some, that Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitious Persons should be accounted such good Subjects, and her most faithful Ministers and Servants. The Queen, finding, that the Citizens took this Matter more patiently than she expected, by degrees attempted greater Matters. Her Mass was before but privately celebrated, without any great Solemnity; but, on the 1<hi>st</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> she added all the gaudry of Popish Offices to it. The Reform'd Ministers of the Gospel took this very grievously, and complain'd much of it in their Pulpits, putting the Nobility in mind of their Duty.

                  </gap> Opinions thereupon.</note> a Dispute was agitated betwixt a Few in a private House, Whether 'twere lawful to restrain Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, which was likely to spread and ruin all? or, Whether they might, by Force, reduce the chief Magistrate to the Bounds of the Law, who set no limits to his own Arbitrariness? The Reform'd Ministers persisted constantly in their Opinion, which had been
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:56771:306"/>
approv'd in former times, That a Magistrate might be compell'd by Force to do his Duty. The Nobles were more unstedfast in their Resolutions, either to curry favour with the Queen, or, out of hopes of Honour and Reward; yet 'twas decreed for Them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Superior in Number and Greatness.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the Court was drown'd in Vice, and loos'd the Reins to all Luxury; neither was it awakened by the News of the Moss-Troops, inhabiting the <hi>English</hi> Borders, who, as if by permission, did freely plunder, and kill'd all that oppos'd them. <hi>Iames,</hi> the Queen's Brother, was sent, with a delegated Power, to suppress them, not so much, as many thought, to honour him, as to expose him to danger. For, as his Power was distaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the Queen, so his innocent Carriage was more offensive in reproving her for her Faults, and stopping her Carreer to Tyranny. But God, beyond all Mens hope, prosper'd his just endeavours; he hang'd 28 of the Robbers, the rest he suppress'd, either by the sole Terror of his Name, or else, by making them give Hostages for their good Behaviour. The Queen seem'd to her Self to have got some Liberty by his Absence, for she was not well pleas'd with the present state of Things; partly, by reason of the Controversies in Religion; and partly, because Matters were manag'd more strictly than a young Woman, who had been educated in the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptest of all Courts, (as interpreting lawful Domination to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seemly for Princes, as if the Slavery of others was their Liberty) could well endure; so that sometimes she was heard to speak some high discontented Words; yea, the Foundation of Tyranny seem'd to be laid: for, whereas all former Kings intrusted their Safety only to the Nobility, she determin'd to have a Guard for her Body; but could find no pretence to bring it about,<note place="margin">The Queen designs to have a Guard for her Body, <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamode</hi> of <hi>France.</hi>
               </note> neither could she give any reasonable colour for her desire, but only vain courtly Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence, and the Usage of foreign Princes. The Deportment of her Brother, the more unblameable it was, troubled her the more, in regard it cut off any opportunity to feign Crimes, or fasten Suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions on him; as also, because she knew he would not endure her loose living; besides, the People were so affected, that they would take a Guard for her Body, as a manifest Omen of Tyranny: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, her restless Mind, determining by any means whatsoever, to effect, what she had once resolv'd upon, devis'd this Stratagem; She had a Brother nam'd <hi>Iohn,</hi> an ambitious Man, and not so strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conversationed, as <hi>Iames</hi> was; he was easily persuaded to be obsequious to the Queen, and thereupon was dearer to Her, as a fitter Instrument to raise Tumults. She communicates her Design to him, in the absence of <hi>Iames,</hi> about raising a Guard; The Plot was laid thus, There was a noise of a Tumult to be bruited a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad in the Night, as if <hi>Iames Hamilton,</hi> Earl of <hi>Arran,</hi> would have surpriz'd the Queen, who had but a few Men to guard Her, and so have carried her to his Castle, 14 Miles off. This story, they thought, would take with the Vulgar, both because the Queen was averse from him, and he extreamly in Love with Her, both which were publickly known; This Tumult was made as the Plot was, and Horsemen scouted about the Neighbour-fields, a good
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:56771:306"/>
part of the Night; and, in the Morning, a Guard was set at the Court-gate, some fretting, others smiling thereat; The Authors of this project, though they knew themselves that they were not believ'd, yet were mightily pleas'd, as secure of Mens opinions, and knowing, that none, there present, durst oppose them. Upon this beginning, the Court ran headlong into Wantonness and Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; notwithstanding, as yet, Justice was equally administred, and Offences punish'd; for the chief management of Affairs was in <hi>Iames,</hi> the Queen's Brother, who, for his Equity and Valor, was dear to all; He us'd, as his chief Counsellor, <hi>William Maitland,</hi> a young Man of a great Judgment, having already given large Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments thereof, and rais'd up higher Expectations, for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Their joint virtuous Counsels kept things quiet at Home and Abroad, and 'twas as well, as good Men could wish; As for the Factious, they could rather fret, than complain justly.</p>
            <p>Amidst these things, a Debate arose in the Court, which held them play three whole Months. They, who had been Kings or Regents in former times, had exhausted the publick Treasure,<note place="margin">The Queen raises her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues out of Estates of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticks.</note> (which was never great in <hi>Scotland</hi>) the Queen was immoderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expenceful; The Estates of the Nobility and Commonalty, in the late Tumults, were mightily wasted; so that now, nothing remain'd to maintain Court-expences, but the Ecclesiastical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues. Whereupon, the chief of the Clergy were sent for to Court, and some of the prime Nobility were added to that Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that could either cajole them by Persuasion, or compel them by Force. After a long Dispute, the Ecclesiasticks, being overcome rather with the sense of their own Weakness, than the weight of any Reason, the Conclusion was, That a 3<hi>d</hi> part should be taken off from Ecclesiastical Revenues, wherewith the Queen should maintain <hi>Orthodox</hi> Ministers, and reserve the rest for her own use. This Conclusion was pleasing to none: The rich Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticks grudg'd, that any of their old Revenues should be par'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; and the Reform'd Ministers expected no good from the Queen: yet indeed, though a great shew was made, she got no great matter by it; For many of the old Possessors had their 3<hi>ds</hi> forgiven; many, both Men and Women, had the Wages for their houshold Service, and Expence, paid out of it, for many Years; many got Pensions and Supports for their old Age. That Winter, the Queen created her Brother <hi>Iames,</hi> Earl of <hi>Marr,</hi> with the great assent of all good Men; For giving Honour to Virtue,<note place="margin">

               </note> all did praise Her; that she allow'd some Grains to propinquity in Blood, none did dispraise Her; and many thought, she had done well for the Publick, in advancing a Person to Honour, who was of an Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrious Stock, and had so highly deserved of his Country, that so he might preside over publick Affairs, with the greater Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; yea, some thought, that this Favour of the Queen's was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to reconcile him to Her, who, she knew, was offended at the Carriage of the Court, in his absence. Besides, he had a Wife provided for him, <hi>Agnes Keith,</hi> Daughter of the Earl of <hi>Merch,</hi> at which Marriage, there was such magnificent Feasting, or, rather, such immoderate Luxury, that the Minds of his Friends
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:56771:307"/>
were grievously offended, and his Enemies took occasion of exclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming and envying; and the more, because he had been so temperate, all the former part of his Life. Not long after, <hi>Murray</hi> was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed upon him, instead of <hi>Marr</hi> (which was found the ancient Right of <hi>Iohn Erskin.</hi>

               </note>) <hi>Gordon,</hi> being depriv'd, first of <hi>Marr,</hi> then of <hi>Murray,</hi> over which Country he had been long Governour, look'd upon himself as robb'd of his Patrimony, and therefore levelled all his Designs at the Overthrow of his Corrival. And besides, he had many other Motives thereunto. For, being far the richest Man in all <hi>Scotland,</hi> by reason of the Rewards his Ancestors had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, for their Service to the Crown, and also himself had augment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Power of his Family by ill Arts. First, he overthrew <hi>Iohn Forbes,</hi> (as I said before) by false Witnesses: Next, when <hi>Iames Stuart,</hi> Brother of <hi>Iames</hi> the Fifth, died without Children, he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd of them, who sat at Helm, the Stewardship of <hi>Murray,</hi> whereby he carried himself as Heir, and arriv'd at such a pitch of Greatness, that all his Neighbours laid down their Emulation, and and rested quietly under his Authority, I had almost said, his Vassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages.</p>
            <p>But whilst others submitted to him, either for fear of Danger, or Patience to bear the Yoak, he was much troubled with the Disre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of one Man, or, as he called it, Pride; and that was of <hi>Iames Macintosh,</hi> chief of a great Family amongst the old <hi>Scots</hi>; he was born, and brought up, amongst the brute Highlanders, us'd to the Prey; but yet, whether 'twere by a secret instinct of Nature, or else by good Instructors, he arriv'd at that degree of Courtesy, Modesty, and decent Behaviour, that he might vie with those, who had the greatest care us'd in their virtuous Education. <hi>Gordon</hi> sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected this young-Man's Power, for, he knew, he could not use so good a Disposition, as an Instrument for his wicked Purposes; and therefore, on a sudden, he laid Hands on him, and cast him into Prison; but, not able to find any Crime in him worthy of Death, 'tis reported, he suborn'd some of his Friends to persuade him, to submit himself and his Cause to him, for That, they told him, was the only Way to be delivered honourably out of Prison, and also to have the Friendship of so powerful a Man, as <hi>Gordon.</hi> Thus the simple and plain-hearted Man was cheated into his own Destruction; yet <hi>Gordon,</hi> being willing to avoid the Envy of his Death, dealt with his Wife to bear the blame of it; she being a Woman of a stern manly Courage, presently undertook the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iames Macintosh</hi> unjustly put to death by <hi>Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> and his Wife.</note> and, in the absence of her Husband, the poor innocent betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed young-Man had his Head cut off. His Neighbours were either so astonish'd at this Man's Punishment, or else were so aton'd with Gifts, that the whole Country, beyond the <hi>Caledonians,</hi> was under his Jurisdiction alone; so that, being a Man ambitious of Power and Glory, he took it very ill, that <hi>Iames,</hi> Earl of <hi>Murray,</hi> was set up, as his Rival; and, being impatient of the present State of things, he took all occasions to promote Disturbances, and did dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly calumniate his Proceedings in publick; yea, he gave a Book, written with his own Hand, to the Queen, wherein he accused him to affect Tyranny, but he back'd it with very slender Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>

               </note> was thereby excited to attempt against the said Earl of <hi>Murray</hi>; for, having spent his Youth wantonly amongst Whores and Bauds, he was reduc'd to that pass, as either to raise up a Civil War, or else to support his Poverty by some audacious Fact: When he had conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all ways to compass his Design of disturbing the Publick Peace, he thought it his best course to set <hi>Murray</hi> and the <hi>Hamiltons</hi> together by the Ears; his Hope seemed sure to destroy one of the Parties thereby, no matter which. First then, he goes to <hi>Murray,</hi> and endeavours to persuade him, to root out the <hi>Hamiltons,</hi> a Family distasteful and obnoxious to the Queen, the whole Kingdom, and especially to himself; and he offered him his Assistance therein, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leging, that the thing would not be unacceptable to the Queen, in regard, besides the common ground of Hatred, that Princes bear against their Kindred, as desirous of their Ruin, the Queen had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so some particular and just Causes of Offence; either because of his Affection to the Evangelical Doctrine and Discipline, of which <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran</hi> was the only Assertor, for which also he had incurr'd the Hatred of the <hi>Guises</hi> in <hi>France</hi>; or else, for the hard Words he had lately given to one of the Queen's Uncles, the Marquess of <hi>Elbeuf,</hi> then in <hi>Scotland.</hi> But <hi>Murray,</hi> being an honest conscientious Man, scorn'd to commit so base a Fact. Whereupon, <hi>Hepburn</hi> went to the <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miltons,</hi> and offered his Service to them, to destroy <hi>Murray,</hi> whose Power they could not well brook; he told them, That he was the only Man, who was an Obstacle to their hopes, and an Impeder of their Concerns; if he were taken away, the Queen must needs be in their power, whether she would or no; and the Means were facile and easy. The Queen was then at <hi>Falkland,</hi> a Castle seated in a Town of the same Name: There is a small Wood in the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, wherein <hi>Deer,</hi> of the nature of Stags (mistakenly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Fallow-Deer,</hi> by the Country) were kept and fed. The Queen might be easily surpriz'd, as she went thither, every day, or to any neighbour-place, with a small Retinue, at which time, 'twere ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry easy to destroy <hi>Murray,</hi> being unarm'd, and suspecting no such thing, and to get the Queen's Person into their Hands: he quickly persuaded the rest; and a time was appointed to perform the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise; only the Earl of <hi>Arran</hi> did execrate the Wickedness, and sent Letters privately to <hi>Murray,</hi> acquainting him with the Series of the whole Plot: <hi>Murray</hi> writes back to him, by the same Messenger; but <hi>Arran</hi> being casually absent, the Letters were given to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Whereupon, a Consultation being held, <hi>Arran</hi> was shut up a close Prisoner, by his Father, from whence, making his Escape by Night, he went towards <hi>Falkland</hi>: As his Escape was made known, Horsemen were sent after him, all over the Country, to fetch him back again, but he hid himself in a Wood, and frustrated their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, for that Night; and in the Morning, came to <hi>Falkland,</hi> where he discovered the whole Order of the treasonable Design. Not long after, <hi>Bothwel,</hi> and <hi>Gawin Hamilton,</hi> who had underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, with a Party of Men, to commit the Fact, follow'd him, and, by the Queen's Command, had a Guard set upon them, as Prisoners,

That Night, when he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, his Mind was so divided between Piety and Love, that he was almost besides himself; his Countenance and Speech gave evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent signs of some Perturbation of Spirit; besides, there were other Causes, which might affect the young Man's Mind. For, whereas he had been brought up magnificently, till that very Day, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Greatness of his Family; his Father, being a covetous Man, by the persuasion of some Counsellors, who nourish'd that Vice in him, reduc'd him only to one Servant, who, before, had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Attendants. They, who attempted the Exploit, were sent to divers Prisons; <hi>Bothwel</hi> to <hi>Edinburgh</hi>-Castle, <hi>Gawin</hi> to <hi>Sterlin,</hi> till their Cause was tried; <hi>Arran</hi> was sent to St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> whither the Queen was going, to be there kept in the Archbishop's Castle; there, in his lucid Intervals, he wrote such wise and prudent Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to the Queen, concerning himself and others, that many were suspicious, he had counterfeited himself mad, only to free his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the Treason: As for the rest, he constantly and sharply accus'd them; insomuch, that when he was brought to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and so private a Conspiracy could not be prov'd by other Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, he proffer'd to fight with <hi>Bothwel,</hi> himself. About the same time, <hi>Iames Hamilton, Arran</hi>'s Father, first wrote, and after that came, to St. <hi>Andrews</hi> to the Queen, earnestly desiring her to take Surety for his Son, <hi>Bothwel,</hi> and <hi>Gawin Hamilton,</hi> and leave them to him, but he could not be heard. At the same time also, the Queen took <hi>Dunbarton</hi>-Castle, the strongest in all <hi>Scotland,</hi> which <hi>Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> had held,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dunbarton</hi>-Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle taken by the Queen.</note> ever since he was Regent. <hi>George Gordon,</hi> being an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to <hi>Murray,</hi> was now grown to a far greater hate of <hi>Hamilton,</hi> his Son's Father-in-Law, who was accus'd of so manifest a Crime, and almost convicted thereof; he thought now, he had a good op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to rid his Enemy out of the way, especially when Two such noble Families were join'd to his side. And first, he caus'd a Tumult to be rais'd in the Town, then but thin of Company, by his own Friends, hoping, that <hi>Murray</hi> would come out from the Court, to appease it by his Authority; and then, being unarm'd, he might be easily slain in the Croud. This Project did not succeed, as he would have it;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gordon</hi>'s Plot to kill <hi>Murray,</hi> prevented.</note> and therefore he sent some of his Septarm'd into the Court, to do the Fact; they entred in the Evening, and were to kill <hi>Murray,</hi> as he was returning to his Lodging from the Queen, who was wont to keep him late at Night; that time seem'd fittest, both to commit the Fact, and to escape after it was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. When the Matter was discovered to <hi>Murray,</hi> he would not have believ'd it, unless he had seen it with his Eyes; and therefore he got some few of his faithfullest Friends, (to prevent all Suspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:56771:308"/>
and took one or two of the <hi>Gordons</hi> in their Armour, as he grop'd with his Hand in the Passage. The Matter being brought to the Queen, <hi>Gordon</hi> was sent for, who pretended, that some of his Retinue, that were about to go home, had arm'd themselves, but, upon some occasion or other, were detain'd; this Excuse was rather receiv'd than approv'd of; and so they departed, for that time. That Summer, by the Mediation of Embassadors on both sides, it was propos'd,<note place="margin">An Interview designed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Queens of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> at <hi>York,</hi> but disappointed.</note> That the Queens of <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>England</hi> should have an Interview at <hi>York,</hi> there to debate many Controversies; but when they were almost ready for their Journy, the Matter was put off till another time. The Cause of deferring the Conference, was vulgarly bruited, because the Duke <hi>D'Aumale,</hi> one of the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the <hi>Guises,</hi> had intercepted and opened the Letters of the <hi>English</hi> Embassador, then at the <hi>French</hi> Court; and that by his means principally, the <hi>English</hi> Ship, which carried another Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sador, was taken and plunder'd.

But, as that Fact did procure him the Love and Reverence of good Men, so it did daily more and more excite the Minds of the Envious to his Destruction; for, whereas Three very potent Families had plotted his Ruin, so the Accession of the <hi>Guises</hi> made a Fourth; for they, being willing to restore the old Popish Religion, and knowing, they could never ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it, as long as <hi>Murray</hi> was alive, imploy'd their utmost Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to remove him out of the way; many concurrent Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances did contribute to the seeming Feasibility of the Attempt; especially because the <hi>French,</hi> who had accompanied the Queen to <hi>Scotland,</hi> being return'd home, had related, what great Interest and Power <hi>Gordon</hi> had, how unquiet his Mind was, and what Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of Assistance he had made, to introduce the Mass: All these things they aggravated in their Discourse, to the height. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Matter was debated by the Papists, in the <hi>French</hi> Court; and This Way of effecting it resolv'd upon; They write to the Queen, to cherish the mad Spirit of <hi>Gordon,</hi> by large Promises, That she should rather pretend than promise, to marry <hi>Iohn,</hi> his Son; That so, being hoodwink'd with that Hope, they might lead him whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they pleas'd; and also, they gave her the Names of those in a List, whom they would have destroy'd and slain. Besides, Letters from the Pope, and the Cardinal, were sent to her, to the same Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; For, whereas her Revenue was not sufficient to maintain that immoderate Luxury, to which she had used her self, she craved some pecuniary Aid of the Pope, as if it were to manage a War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst those, who had revolted from the <hi>Roman</hi> Church: The Pope wrote something obscurely; but the Cardinal plainly, That she should not want Mony for that War, yet so, that Those must be first slain, whose Names were given her in a Scrole.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:56771:309"/>The Queen shewed these Letters to <hi>Murray,</hi> and to the rest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd for the Slaughter; either, because, she thought, they would have some notice of it another way; or else, to make them believe, she was sincere towards them, as not hiding from them any of her secret Counsels. Thereupon, all other things being fitted for the Attempt, the Queen pretended a great desire to visit the Parts of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which lie Northwards; and <hi>Gordon</hi> promoted her Desire, by his forward Invitation.

Gordon</hi> was not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant hereof; and therefore, to cast the Ballance, he promis'd, by his Wife, to restore the Roman Religion: The Queen was glad of that; yet there was one Impediment, and that no great one, which kept her from assenting to him, and that was, that she did not think it to stand with her Honour, to be reconciled to <hi>Iohn,</hi> his Son, (who, a few days before, had been committed to Prison for a Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult raised at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> but had made his Escape,) unless he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to <hi>Sterlin,</hi> to be there a Prisoner of State, at least, for a few days. The Queen insisted upon this, not so much for that Cause, which was pretended, as that she might have her way clear, when <hi>Murray</hi> was kill'd, and might not be compell'd to marry, when her Lover was absent: <hi>Gordon</hi> was willing to satisfy the Queen, yet made some scruple to give up his Son, as a Pledg, into the Hands of a Man, who was the most adverse, of all others, to his Designs, (and that was <hi>Iohn,</hi> Earl of <hi>Marr, Murray</hi>'s Uncle, Governour of <hi>Sterlin</hi>-Castle) especially being uncertain, how the Queen would take the Murder, when it was committed. Whilst these cunning Wits endeavoured to impose one upon another, and were mutually suspicious, the Queen affirming, that the Delay was not in her part, that the Matter was not dispatched; and yet she us'd no Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, neither. <hi>Iohn Gordon,</hi> to shew himself officious, and to watch all Events, had got together about a Thousand of his Friends and Tenants well-arm'd, and had quarter'd them in the Vicinage, near the Town. But <hi>Murray,</hi> though not guarded, as he would, yet saw, that all these things were prepar'd for his Ruin, for so he had been advertised by his Friends, both from the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Courts; neither was he much confident of the Queen, yet, in the day-time, he perform'd his accustom'd Services in the Court; and at Night, had only one or two of his Servants to watch in his Chamber; and being often inform'd of the Plots of his Enemies

against him, yet, by the Help of his Friends, he disappointed all their Purposes, without any Noise.</p>
            <p>About the same time,<note place="margin">

               <hi>Bothwel</hi> was let down by a Rope out of a Window, and so escaped from the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> Matters stood at a stay at <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> by reason of the Dissimulation on both sides. And the Queen, intending to make a further Progress, was invited by <hi>Iohn Lesly,</hi> a Noble Man, and Client of <hi>Gordons,</hi> to his House, about twelve Miles off; that being a lonesome Place, seem'd fit to the <hi>Gordons,</hi> to commit the Murder: But <hi>Lesly,</hi> who knew their secret Design, interpos'd and dissuaded them from it, not to put that brand of Infamy on himself and his Family, that he should betray the Queen's chief Brother, a Man not otherwise bad, against whom he had no private Grudg, to the Slaughter. The next night, they pass'd over quietly enough at <hi>Rothymay,</hi> a Town of the <hi>Abre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nethies,</hi> because, the day after, they determin'd to lodg at <note n="â€–" place="margin">Or, <hi>Strathbogy.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Strabog,</hi> a Castle of the <hi>Gordons</hi>; so that they deferr'd the Murder till that time, because there All would be in their power. In their Journy, <hi>Gordon</hi> had a long Discourse with the Queen, and at last, he came to this, plainly to desire the Queen to pardon his Son <hi>Iohn,</hi> that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a young Man, and ignorant of the Laws, he had made his Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape out of Prison, into which he was cast for no hainous Offence, only for a Commotion, which was not rais'd by him, neither. But the Queen urg'd, that her Authority would be vilified, unless his Son did return, at least for some days, into another Prison, though a larger one; that so, his former Fault being, as 'twere, expiated, he might more creditably be dismiss'd: Though it were but a slight Command, yet <hi>Gordon,</hi> who was willing to omit no opportunity of committing the design'd Fact, did obstinately refuse to comply with it, either, because he might cast the blame of the Murder upon his Son, if the Queen did not approve it, when 'twas done; or, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, if the thing should be done in the Absence of his Son, though she were not unwilling thereto, yet he should be kept as an Hostage. The Queen was so much offended at this Stubbornness of <hi>Gordon,</hi> that, when she was almost in sight of his House, she turn'd aside ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way; so that the whole Plot, so wisely contriv'd, as they thought, was now quite cast off the hinges, till they came to <hi>Inver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi> For there, besides <hi>Gordon</hi>'s being Lord President for the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration of Justice, he also commanded the Queen's Castle, which was seated on an high Hill, and commanded the Town; and besides, the whole Country thereabouts were his Vassals. The Queen determined to lodg in the Castle,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gordon</hi>'s bold Attempt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Queen her self,</note> but was not suffer'd by the Guards; being thus excluded, she began to fear, in regard she was to lodg all Night in an unfortified Town; and in the mean time, <hi>Huntly</hi>'s Son had about a Thousand choice Horse now in Arms, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides a promiscuous Multitude of the Parts adjacent. But the Queen, taking Counsel from her present Circumstances, set a Watch at all Avenues into the Town; she commanded the Ships, which had brought her Provisions, to ride ready in the River, that if her Guards were beaten off, she might have a Retreat to Them. In the midst of the Night, some Scouts was sent out by <hi>Huntly</hi>; and the first Watch let them pass on purpose, till they came to a
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:56771:310"/>
narrow Passage, there they were all surrounded and taken; and, of the Highlanders, the <hi>Macintoshes</hi> Tribe, as soon as they understood they were to fight against the Queen, forsook <hi>Huntly,</hi> and came to her, the day after, into the Town. A great Multitude of the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers, when they heard of the Danger of their Prince, part by Persuasion, part of their own Accord, came in, and especially the <hi>Frazers</hi> and <hi>Monroes,</hi> valiant Families in those Countries: The Queen, now being secure against any Force, began to besiege the Castle: The Besieged were not enough for Number, neither was it well fortifi'd or prepared to indure a Siege, so that it was sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendered to her; the chief Defendants were put to Death, the rest were sent to their own homes. The Nobility came in on all parts; upon the coming of some,<note place="margin">Disappointed.</note> others were permitted to go home; so, on the 4<hi>th</hi> day after, with a Guard strong enough, she returned to <hi>Aberdeen.</hi> There, being freed from Fear, she was mightily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed with Hatred against <hi>Gordon,</hi> and being eager to be revenged, she again received her Brother, outwardly, into her Favour, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending, that her Dependance was wholly on him: Yea, she in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to persuade others, that her Safety was bound up in his Life. Hereupon, <hi>Gordon,</hi> perceiving, that the whole Face of the Court was altered; that the Earl of <hi>Murray,</hi> lately design'd for the Slaughter, was now in great Favour; and that himself was fallen from the top of his Hopes, into a mortal Hatred; and perceiving, he was gone further, than would admit a Retreat and Pardon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took himself to desperate Counsels; he thought no Remedy better for his present Danger, than, by all means, to get the Queen into his Power; and though, he knew, he should grievously offend her at present by the Attempt, yet he did not despair, but her womanly Heart might be made flexible, by Observance, Flattery, and the Marriage of his Son, of which her Uncles were supposed to be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivers.</p>
            <p>This Design he communicated to his Friends, and resolved, by some means or other,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gordon</hi>'s design against <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray</hi>'s Life.</note> to remove <hi>Murray</hi> out of the way; for if that were done, there was none besides, to whom the Queen would commit the Government; or, who was able to manage it. His Spies gave him hope of the Feasibility of the thing; and amongst others, <hi>George Gordon,</hi> Earl of <hi>Sutherland,</hi> who was a daily Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant at Court, and, pretending good Will to the Queen, did fish out all her Counsels, and, by fit Messengers, acquainted <hi>Huntly</hi> therewith; yea, he did not only observe the opportunities of Time and Place, but also promised his Assistance to effect it. Besides, the Town was open on every side, and fit for any private Attempt; the Inhabitants, either by Largesses won, or by Alliances joined, or with Fear terrified, would attempt nothing to the contrary. The High-landers were dismiss'd with the Earl of <hi>Murray</hi>; there were but a few, and they came too from remote parts, whom he did not much fear to disoblige: And seeing all the Neighbour-Countries were in his Power, the matter might be transacted without Blood, only one Man's Death might put the Queen into his Hands, the other Wounds might be easily cured: These things drove him on to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt the Matter, and when the Way to accomplish it was now
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:56771:310"/>
fix'd, some Letters of the Earl of <hi>Sutherland</hi> and <hi>Iohn Lesly</hi> were intercepted, which discover'd the whole Intrigue. <hi>Sutherland,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Discovery, fled for it, but <hi>Lesly</hi> acknowledged his Fault, and obtained his Pardon, and ever after, as long as he liv'd, performed true and faithful Service, first to the Queen, then to the King. <hi>Huntly,</hi> who, with a great Body of Men, waited the Event of his Design, in a place almost inaccessible by reason of the circumjacent Marishes, by the advice of his Friends, determined to retreat to the Mountains; but many of the Neighbour Nobility then with the Queen, being his Friends, he trusted to their Promises, and therefore altered his Resolution, and determined to abide the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of a Battel in that advantagious Place; <hi>Murray</hi> had scarce an 100 Horse, in which he could confide; but there followed him of the Nobles, then present, <hi>Iames Douglas,</hi> Earl of <hi>Morton,</hi> and <hi>Patrick Lindsy</hi>; with these, he march'd forth against the Enemy, the rest were Country-Men of the Neighbour-hood, gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, about 800, whom <hi>Huntly,</hi> for the most part, had corrupted before, and were more likely to draw on <hi>Murray</hi>'s Party to their Ruin, than give them any Aid; yet they made mighty Boastings in words, promising, That they themselves, without any other help, would subdue the Enemy; Others should but look on, and be Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators only. Some Horsemen were sent before, to keep all Passages about the Marish, that <hi>Huntly</hi> might not escape; the rest march'd softly after, and though, the Night before, many of the <hi>Gordonians</hi> had slipped away, yet he had still with him above 300 Men, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining themselves in their Posts. When <hi>Murray</hi> came thither, he stood with his Party, in Order and Rank, on a small Hill, where he overlook'd all the Marish; the rest, as they were advancing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Enemy, gave evident Tokens of Treachery, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Boughs of Heath on their Helmets, (for that Plant grows in abundance in those Parts) that they might be known by the Enemy. When they came near, the <hi>Huntleans,</hi> secure of the Success, hasten to them, and seeing the adverse Army disordered, by the Traitors, and put to Flight, that they might more nimbly pursue them, they cast away their Lances, and, with their drawn Swords, to terrify those Ranks that stood, they cried out <hi>Treason, Treason,</hi> and made with great Violence at the Enemy. The Traitors, thinking, that they should also put to Flight the standing Party, made haste to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it; But <hi>Murray,</hi> perceiving no hope in Flight, and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing remain'd, but to dye nobly, cried out to his Party, to hold out their Lances, and not to let those that were running away, come in amongst them: They, being thus unexpectedly excluded from both Wings, passed by in great Disorder.

Fault, what Slaughter was made that Day, 'twas They that did it. There were 120 of the <hi>Huntleans</hi> slain, and 100 taken Prisoners; of the other Army, not a Man was lost. Amongst the Prisoners, was <note n="*" place="margin">The <hi>Gordons</hi> taken Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</note> 
               <hi>Huntly</hi> himself, and his two Sons, <hi>Iohn</hi> and <hi>Adam</hi>; the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being an old Man, corpulent and pussy, dyed under the Hands of those that took him. The rest, late at Night, were brought to <hi>Aberdeen.

            <p>A few days after, <hi>Iohn Gordon</hi> was put to Death, not without the Trouble of many,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iohn Gordon</hi> put to Death.</note> for he was a manly Youth, very beautiful, and entring on the prime of his Age, not so much designed for the Royal Bed, as deceived by the Pretence thereof; and that which moved no less Indignation than Pity, was, that he was beheaded by an unskilful Headsman. The Queen beheld his Death with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Tears, but, as she was prone to conceal and counterfeit Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, so, various Descants were made upon her Grief and Passion; and the rather, because many knew, that her Brother was as much hated by her, as <hi>Huntly:</hi> She pardoned <hi>Adam,</hi> because he was but young; <hi>George</hi> the eldest Son, in this desperate case, fled from his House to his Father-in-Law <hi>Iames Hamilton,</hi> there to shelter him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; or else, by his Mediation to obtain his Pardon. As for <hi>Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>'s Followers, according to the Degrees of their Offences, some were fined, others banish'd the Land; many sent packing into re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote parts of the Kingdom, that they might make no more Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions at home: Those, who lighted upon powerful Intercessors, were remitted their Offence, and taken into former Grace and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour: Matters being thus settled, or, at least, appeased for the present, the rest of the Winter was spent in Peace.</p>

               <hi>Bothwel,</hi> who had escap'd out of Prison, was, by a Proclamation, commanded to render himself again, and in Default thereof, he not obeying, was declared a publick Enemy. When the Queen was returned from <hi>Aberdene</hi> to St. <hi>Iohn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston's, Iames Hamilton</hi> came to her, to beg Pardon for <hi>George Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> his Son-in-Law; he received an Answer not wholly severe, yet was forced to deliver up his Son-in-Law, who was sent Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to <hi>Dunbar,</hi> and, the next Year after, which was 1563, on the 7<hi>th</hi> of the Calends <note n="â€ " place="margin">

            <p>Now the time of the Parliament drew near, which was sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd to be held the 20<hi>th</hi> day of <hi>May,</hi> where the Queen, with the Crown on her Head, and her Royal Robes, went in great Pomp to the Parliament-house, a new Spectacle to many, but that Men had been accustom'd to bear the Government of Women in her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's and Grandmother's Days.

This Young Man, being of an high Linage, and very beautiful, the Son of her Aunt, the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> received very courteously, and delighting daily in his Society, the common Speech was, That she would marry him; neither was the Nobility against it, because they saw many advantages might redound to <hi>Britain,</hi> by that Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, if it might be made by the Queen of <hi>England</hi>'s Consent. Both of them were in an equal Degree of Consanguinity from her, and she was so far from being against it, that she was willing rather to seem the Author of it, and so to lay some Obligation upon her, in making the Match; besides, she thought it for her Advantage, to humble the Power of her Kinswoman, by this condescending Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, that it might not swell beyond what was safe and fit for Neighbours. But when all was concluded on, there fell out a Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness which retarded all, and turn'd every thing, as it were, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side down; to make it plain, I must fetch the Original Story, a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle higher.</p>
            <p>There was one <note n="â€–" place="margin">The Story of <hi>David Rize.</hi>

<pb n="172" facs="tcp:56771:312"/>
into <hi>Scotland</hi>; but, <hi>Morettius</hi> being a Man of no great Estate, and looking upon his Service as unnecessary and useless, he resolved to stay in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and try his Fortune there, especially because he had heard, that the Queen was delighted in Musick, and was not ignorant of the Grounds of it, her self. Whereupon, to make way to her Presence, he first dealt with her Musicians, of which many were <hi>French,</hi> to admit him into their Society, which they did; and having plaid his part once or twice, was lik'd very well, whereupon he was made one of their Set and Company, and he so complied with the Queen's Humour, that, partly by flattering her, and partly by undermining others, he grew into high Favour with her, and into the extream Hate of his Fellows; neither was he content with this favourable blast of Fortune, but he despised his Equals too, and, by sundry Criminations, worm'd them out of their Places; then he rose higher, and began to treat about Matters of State, and, by degrees, was made Secretary; and, by that means, had opportunity of private Converse with the Queen, apart from others.</p>
            <p>The sudden advance of this Man, from a low, and almost beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly, Estate, to such a Power, Wealth and Dignity, afforded Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Discourse to the People; His Fortune was above his Virtue; and his Arrogance, Contempt of his Equals, and Contention with his Superiours, were above his Fortune. This Vanity and Madness of the Man was much increas'd and nourish'd by the Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery of the Nobility; who sought his Friendship, courted him, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd his Judgment, walk'd before his Lodgings, observing his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress and Egress: But <hi>Murray</hi> alone, who had no Dissimulation in his Heart, was so far from fauning on him, that he gave him many a sour look, which troubled the Queen, as much as <hi>David</hi> himself; But he, on the other side, to uphold himself in his Station against the Hatred of the Nobles, did apply himself, with great Adulation, to the young <note n="â€ " place="margin">

               </note> Gentleman, who was to be the Queen's Husband; so that he came to be so familiar with him, as to be admitted to his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and Bed-side, and to secret Conference with him; where he persuaded him, out of his unwary Credulity and Forwardness to compass his Desires, that he was the chief occasion to make the Queen to cast her Eye upon him: Besides, he cast in Seeds of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord betwixt him and <hi>Murray,</hi> every day, as knowing, that if he were removed, he should pass the residue of his Life without Affront or Disturbance.</p>
            <p>There was now much talk abroad, not only of the Queen's Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage with <hi>Henry,</hi> and his secret recourse to her; but also of the too great Familiarity betwixt her and <hi>David Rize: Murray,</hi> who, by his plain downright advice to his Sister, got nothing, but her Hatred, resolved to leave the Court, that so he might not be thought the Author of what was acted there. And the Queen was willing enough, that so severe a Supervisor of her Actions should with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw, especially in a Season, whilst she was strengthning the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Faction: For she recall'd those which were banish'd, <hi>Bothwel,</hi> from <hi>France; George Gordon,</hi> Earl of <hi>Sutherland,</hi> from <hi>Flanders</hi>; the other <hi>George Gordon,</hi> Son to the Earl of <hi>Huntly,</hi> she delivered out
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:56771:312"/>
of Prison, and restored to his former Place and Dignity. When <hi>Bothwel</hi> was return'd from <hi>France, Murray</hi> accuses him of the Treasonable Practices he had lately committed against him: Some of those Noble-Men, and Gentlemen, who were his Familiars in <hi>France,</hi> were Witnesses against him. The Matter was clear, foul, and heinous. A Day was appointed for the Trial, but the Queen first dealt earnestly with her Brother, to desist from the Prosecution; which he refused, judging his Credit to be much at stake, which way soever the balance did incline, in the Case. What did the Queen do next, but wrote Letters to many of the Nobility, not to appear at the time appointed? and as <hi>Alexander,</hi> Earl of <hi>Glencarn, Murrays</hi> intimate Friend, was passing by <hi>Sterlin,</hi> she sent for him, out of the way, to her; yet all good Men were so well agreed in the Case, that <hi>Bothwel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bothwel</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voids his Trial.</note> being precondemn'd in his own Conscience, and moved with the general detestation of the wicked Attempt, durst not abide the Trial. This favour of the People to <hi>Murray,</hi> did so inrage the Queen's Mind against him, that she hastned his, long before design'd, End, and the Manner to accomplish it, was This: <hi>Murray</hi> was to be sent for to <hi>Perth,</hi> where the Queen was with a few Attendants, there <hi>Darnly</hi> was to discourse him, and, in the Conference, they all knew, he would speak his mind freely; and then a Quarrel would arise, upon which <hi>David Rize</hi> was to give him the first blow, then the rest were to Wound him to Death. <hi>Murray</hi> was made acquainted with this Conspiracy by his Friends at Court, yet, come what would, he resolved to go; but, as he was on his Journy, being again advis'd by <hi>Patrick Ruven,</hi> he turned aside to his Mother's house, near <hi>Loch Levin,</hi> and, being troubled with a Lask, excused himself and staid there. Thither some of his Friends came to visit him, upon which, a Report was presently spread, that he staid there, to intercept the Queen and <hi>Darnly</hi> in their Return to <hi>Edinburgh</hi>; whereupon Horsemen were sent out, but they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered no Men in Arms, or sign of any Force, yet the Queen made such haste, and was so fearful in this Journy, as if some great Danger had been at hand.</p>
            <p>The Marriage was now at hand, and a great part of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility call'd together at <hi>Sterlin,</hi> That so the Queen might coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance her Will and Pleasure with some pretence of Publick Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent. Most of those, they sent for, were such, as, they knew, would easily give their Assent; or else, that durst not oppose: Many of those, so congregated, assented to the Motion, Provided always, that no Alteration should be made in the <hi>then</hi> establish'd Religion; but the Most did it to gratify the Queen, only <hi>Andrew Stuart,</hi> of <hi>Ochiltry,</hi> openly profest, that he would never give his Consent to the admission of a Popish King. As for <hi>Murray,</hi> he was not averse from the Marriage, (for he was the first Adviser, that the young Man should be call'd out of <hi>England</hi>) but he foresaw, what Tumults it would occasion, if it were celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted without the consent of the Queen of <hi>England</hi>; besides, he promis'd to procure her Consent, that so all things might go on favourably, Provision being made about Religion; but, perceiving,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:56771:313"/>
that there would be no freedom of Debate in that Convention, he chose rather to be absent, than to declare his Opinion, which might prove destructive to himself, and no way advantagious to the Commonwealth.</p>
            <p>Moreover, there was a Question started and discours'd, amongst the Vulgar,<note place="margin">Various Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Queen's marriage with <hi>Darnly.</hi>
               </note> Whether the Queen, upon her Husbands death, might not marry any other Man, whom she pleas'd? Some were of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, That a Queen might have the same freedom, as Men, even of the Commonalty, have; Others, on the contrary, affirming, That the Case was different, in reference to Heirs of Kingdoms, where at once, an Husband was to be taken to a Wife, and a King to be given to the People; and That it was far more Equitable, that the People should provide an Husband for <hi>one</hi> young Queen, than that a young Queen should chuse a King for <hi>all</hi> the People.</p>
            <p>In the Month of <hi>Iuly,</hi> came an Embassador from <hi>England,</hi> who declar'd, That his Mistress did much admire, That, seeing they were both equally allied to Her, they should precipitate so great an Affair without acquainting her therewith; and therefore She earnestly desir'd, that they would stay a while, and weigh the thing a little more seriously, to the great Advantage, probably, of both Kingdoms. This Embassy effected nothing. Whereupon Sir <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas Throgmorton</hi> was sent by the Queen of <hi>England</hi> to tell <hi>Len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nox</hi> and his Son, that they had a Convoy from her, to return at a set Day, and that Day was now past; and therefore, she com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to return, which if they did not, they were to be banish'd, and their Goods Confiscate. They were not at all terrified with the Commination; but persisted in their purpose. In the mean time, the Queen being sensible, that it would seem a very incongruous Match, if She, who was lately the Wife of a Great King, and besides, the Heir of an Illustrious Kingdom, should marry a private young Man, who had no Title of Honour conferr'd upon him, she made an Edict, proclaiming <hi>Darnly</hi> Duke of <hi>Rothsea,</hi> and Earl of <hi>Ross.</hi> Moreover, the Predictions of wizardly Women, in both Kingdoms, did contribute much to hasten the Marriage, who prophesy'd, that, if it were Consummate before the end of <hi>Iuly,</hi> it foretold much future Advantage to them Both; if not, much Reproach and Ignominy. Besides, Rumors were spread abroad of the Death of the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> and the Day mention'd, before which she should die. Which Prediction seem'd not so much to divine things, as to declare a Conspiracy of her Subjects against her. This also added much to the Queen's haste, she knew, her Uncles would be averse from the Marriage; and, if it were longer delay'd, she fear'd, they would cast in some <hi>Remora,</hi> to disturb the Thing, now almost finish'd.</p>
            <p>For, when the secret Decree and Resolution was made, to carry on the <hi>Holy War</hi> thrÃ´ all Christendom, and <hi>Guise</hi> was appointed General of the League to extirpate the Reform'd Religion, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he nourish'd high and ambitious Hopes, and therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd, by his Sisters Daughter, so to trouble <hi>Britain</hi> with do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mestic Tumults, that they should not be able to Aid their Friends beyond Sea. And <hi>David,</hi> who could then do most with the Queen,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:56771:313"/>
urg'd, That the Marriage would be highly advantagious to all Christendom, because <hi>Henry Darnly,</hi> and his Father, were stiff Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers of the Popish Religion, were very Gracious in both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, allied to great Families, and had large Clanships under them. This, being long debated, was at last carried; For, he knew, That if the Marriage were made by the Consent of the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> and the Nobility of <hi>Scotland,</hi> that he should lose two great Points; One, that he should be no ways ingratiated, as before; and the Other, that <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Viz.</hi> Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> Religion would be secur'd. But if the Queen adher'd to the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> then he promis'd Honours, Ecclesiastical Dignities, heaps of Mony, and unrivall'd Power, to himself; So that, turning every Stone, He at last pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd, that the Marriage should be hasten'd. The <hi>Scots</hi> not being much for it, and the <hi>English</hi> very much against it.</p>
            <p>Note, <hi>That the Name of</hi> Henry <hi>is joined with</hi> Mary, <hi>in the Title, tho before their Marriage, is accounted for at the Close of the Catalogue of the</hi> Scotish <hi>Kings, prefixed before the Body of this History.</hi>

               </note> and <hi>O Yes</hi> being made, Proclamation thereof was publickly read, with the applause of the Multitude, <hi>God Save Henry</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> King and Queen of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and, the day after, they were proclaim'd in like Manner, by an Herauld at <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> This Matter did grievously offend the Nobility, and the Commons also; yea, some fretted and openly storm'd, That 'twas a thing of the worst Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that ever was. For, To what purpose was it, to call a Council about making a King; and never to ask their Advice; nor to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with their Authority, but to set up an Herauld instead of a Senate; and a Proclamation for a Statute of Parliament, or Order of Council? so that it was not (said they) a Consultation, but an Essay rather, how the <hi>Scots</hi> would bear the yoke of Tyranny. The absence of so many Nobles increas'd the Suspicion: The chief Nobility were away, <hi>Iames</hi> Duke of <hi>Castle-herault,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Which dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gusts many of the Nobility.</note> 
               <hi>Gilespy</hi> Earl of <hi>Argyle, Iames</hi> Earl of <hi>Murray, Alexander</hi> Earl of <hi>Glencarn, Andrew</hi> Earl of <hi>Rothes,</hi> and many others of Rich and Noble Families. Heraulds were sent to them to command them to come in, which they not doing, were banish'd, and went most of them into <hi>Argyle,</hi> and their Enemies were recall'd to Court. The King and Queen having got as much Force together, as they thought were sufficient to subdue the Rebels, with 4000 Men came to <hi>Glasgow.</hi> The Rebels kept themselves at <hi>Pasley,</hi> where various Consultations were held, according to the Disposition of the Parties. The King and Queen sent an Herauld at Arms to have the Castle of <hi>Hamilton</hi> surrendred to them; which not being done, they prepare themselves for the Fight. The contrary Faction was at variance one with another, and divided into several Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. The <hi>Hamiltons,</hi> who had the greatest Power in those Parts, were of Opinion, That no firm Peace could be made, till the King and Queen were Both taken out of the way; as long as they were safe, nothing could be expected, but new Wars, continual
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:56771:314"/>
Plots, and a counterfeit Peace, worse than an open War, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Men, (said they) may forget Injuries offer'd them, being weary of prosecuting them; yea, sometimes they were recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens'd with great Advantages; but the Wrath of Princes was not to be quench'd, but by Death only. But <hi>Murray</hi> and <hi>Glencarn,</hi> who understood, that their discourse was not founded on the Good of the Publick, but their own private Advantage, (for, upon the Queen's death, they were the next Heirs to the Crown) did equally abhor the Princes death, and <hi>Hamiltons</hi> Government too, which they had lately experienc'd, to be Avaritious and Cruel; so that, They were for milder Counsels, and, in regard, 'twas a civil Dissension, wherein, as yet, there was no blood shed; the Dispute having been hitherto managed by Votes not Arms, they thought it fit, if possible, to end it by an honest Agreement. Hereunto, they thought, many in the King's Army would hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, as being desirous of Peace, and would not be wanting to plead for Those, that, in Defence of their Liberties, were inforc'd to take up Arms. As for the King and Queen, They, being yet young, might not perhaps be so Provident; and, for their Parts, they had not yet so far transgrest, as to indanger the Common-wealth; as for smaller Injuries, which affected their Names and Reputations only, 'twas fitter they were cured by other Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, than Death. For, they remembred, 'twas an old Caution transmitted from their Ancestors,<note place="margin">A Politic Maxim, both Prudent, and also Equitable.</note> for Imitation, <hi>That, in the Lives and Manners of Princes, their hidden Vices ought to be concealed; their doubtful Ones taken in the best sense; and their open Ones, so far born with, as they did not endanger the Ruin of the Publick.</hi> This Opinion pleased the most, and the rest of the <hi>Hamiltons</hi> acquiesced therein, and resolved to be quiet, only <hi>Iames,</hi> chief of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, with 16 Horse, remained with the Nobility; who, being lessened by the recess of the <hi>Hamiltons,</hi> were not able to give Battel to the Enemy, nor yet to break through, each to his own <hi>Clan,</hi> and therefore they yielded to the Times, and came that Night to <note n="*" place="margin">A Town standing on the West-side of <hi>Clyde,</hi> 2 Miles above <hi>Bothwel</hi>-Bridg.</note> 
               <hi>Hamilton,</hi> and the next Day to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> to consult how to manage the War: But, in regard the Castle which command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Town, continually plaid upon them, and their Friends could not come in so soon from remote Parts, as was requisite; and moreover, the King and Queen were reported to be near them with their Forces, by the great Persuasions and Promises of <hi>Iohn Maxwel</hi> of <hi>Herreis,</hi> they directed their Course towards <hi>Dumfreiz.</hi> The King and Queen returned back to <hi>Glascow,</hi> and left the Earl of <hi>Lennox,</hi> their Lieutenant, in the Country towards the South-West, they themselves went afterward to <hi>Sterlin,</hi> and thence into the middle of <hi>Fife.</hi> They made the greatest part of the Nobility take an Oath, That if any Commotion arose from <hi>England,</hi> they would faithfully oppose it; the rest were punish'd, some by Fine, some by Banishment. The Goods of those, who fled into <hi>England,</hi> wherever they could find them, were seized upon, and they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Commissions of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer</hi> to be held in all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,<note place="margin">The Nobles, that rose up in Arms, are quelled.</note> to enquire into the Remains of the Rebellion.</p>
            <p>On the 9<hi>th</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> they drew forth their Army out of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinburgh,</hi> and march'd towards <hi>Dumfriez. Maxwel,</hi> who, till that
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:56771:314"/>
time, had pretended to be highly of the Party, which was against the King, thinking it now a fit opportunity to cater for himself, went forth to meet them, as if he would have interceded for Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, for the whole Party. He dealt with them, to have part of his Father-in-Laws Estate, which he had a great mind to have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow'd upon him; they look'd upon him, as an active subtil Man, fit for Counsel and Business, and granted his Request; whereupon, he return'd to the Rebels, and told them, he could do them no good; and therefore they must all shift for themselves: <hi>England</hi> was near at hand, if they would retire thither, after he had settled his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs at home, he would follow them, and live and die with the Party; In the interim, he got a thousand Pounds from <hi>Murray</hi>; upon the account of Mony, which, he alleged, he had expended in listing some Horse; For, being commanded to raise some few Troops of Horse, he caused all his Domesticks to appear as if they had been Souldiers, formally listed. The Rebels were terrified at the coming of the King and Queen, and at <hi>Maxwels</hi> revolt from them; So that the King and Queen, hereupon, did what they pleas'd; They drove away most of the Leaders of the Faction, and the rest were intent on the Event of their Danger, so that about the end of <hi>October</hi> they return'd to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and all things were quiet in <hi>Scotland,</hi> till the beginning of the next Spring.</p>
            <p>A Convention of all the Estates of the Kingdom was Indicted to be held in <hi>March,</hi> that so the Goods of those who were banish'd might be Confiscate,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rize</hi> persuades the Queen to cut off some of the <hi>Scotish</hi> Nobility, and to entertain Foreigners, as a Guard to her Person.</note> their Names struck out of the Roll of the Nobility, and their Armorial Ensignes torn in Pieces; neither of which the Kings of <hi>Scotland</hi> can lawfully do, without an Act of Parliament. In the interim, <hi>David,</hi> perceiving the Court to be empty of Nobility, and thinking it an opportunity to shew and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the Excessiveness of his Power, did suggest severe Counsel to the Queen, daily pressing her to cut off some of the chief of the Faction; if a few of them (said he) were executed, the rest would be quiet; and in regard, he thought, the Queen's Guard, being <hi>Scots</hi>-men, would not easily consent to the cruel Murder of the Nobility, he was very intent to have them thrown out of their Places, and to introduce Foreigners into their Rooms, (a Project, that is wont to be the beginning of all Tyranny;) first, Mention was made of sending for some <hi>Germans</hi> over for that Service; because that Nation were highly faithful to their Princes: But, when <hi>David</hi> had considered seriously with himself, he thought it more condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive to his Interest to have <hi>Italians</hi>; first, because, being his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-Men, he presumed, they would be more at his Devotion; next, that being Men of no Religion, they would be fitter to make Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbances, so that, he thought, they might easily be induc'd to venture upon any Design, Right or Wrong; for, being wicked and indigent Persons, born and bred up under Tyrants, us'd to War, and being far from their own home, they car'd not what became of <hi>Britain,</hi> and therefore seem'd most Proper to attempt Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Hereupon, Souldiers of Fortune were privately sent for out of <hi>Flanders</hi> and other Countries of the Continent; but they were to come in by Piece-meal, as 'twere, One by One, and at several times,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:56771:315"/>
too, that the Design might not be discover'd: It would be more dangerous (said he) to offend any one of those Ruffians, than the Queen her Self.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The Queen, after her hasty Marriage, is as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soon alienated from the King, who, at the instigation of <hi>Rize,</hi> is plausi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly dismist from Court.</note>But, as <hi>David's</hi> Power and Authority, with the Queen, did daily increase, so the King grew Cheaper with her every Day; for, as She had been rashly precipitate in making the Marriage, so She as soon repented, and gave manifest Tokens of her alienated Mind. For, as presently after the Marriage was celebrated, she had pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly Proclaim'd him King by an Herauld, without the consent of the States, and afterwards, in all her Mandates till that time, the King and Queens Name were exprest, now she chang'd the Order, keeping both Names in, but setting her own, First. At length, the Queen, to deprive her Husband of all opportunity to do Courtesies for any, found fault with him; that, whilst he was busy in Haw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and Hunting, many State-Matters were acted unseasonably; or else, were wholly omitted; and therefore it would be better, that She might subscribe her Name for them Both; and, by this means, he might enjoy his Pleasure, and yet no publick Business be retarded. He was willing to gratify her in every thing, and yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be dismist upon such frivolous Grounds, that so, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from the Council and Privity of publick Affairs, the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation for all Boons might rebound to the Queen her self. For, she thought thus with her self, that if her Husband's Favour could do no good Offices for any, and his Anger were formidable to none, he would, by Degrees, grow to be despis'd by all; and to increase the Indignity, <hi>David</hi> was substituted, with an Iron Seal, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press the King's Name on Proclamations. He, thus fraudulently cheated out of publick Business, lest he might also prove an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupter of their private Pleasures, in a very sharp Winter, was sent away to <note n="*" place="margin">Or, <hi>Pebils.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Pebly,</hi> with a small retinue, far beneath the Dignity of some private Persons, for a Prey rather than Recreation. At the same time, there fell such a quantity of Snow, that, the Place not being very Plentiful, and besides, troubled with Thieves; He, that was always bred up at Court, and used to a liberal Diet, was in great hazard of wanting Necessaries, unless the Bishop of the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cades</hi> had casually come thither; for he, knowing the scarcity of the Place, brought him some Wine, and other Provisions, for his use.</p>
            <p>The Queen was not content to advance <hi>David,</hi> and, as 'twere, to shew him to the People, from such an obscure Original, on the account before mention'd; but she advis'd another way, how to cloath him with domestick Honour: For, whereas the Queen had, for some Months before, permitted more Company than was u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual to sit with her at her Table; that so, in the Croud, <hi>David's</hi> place might be less envy'd; by this shew of Popularity, she thought, to gain the point, that the unaccustomedness of the Sight would, by the Multitude of Guests and daily Usage, be somewhat alleviat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and so Mens high Stomachs, by degrees, be inur'd to bear any thing. At last it came to this, That but he and one or two more fat at Meat with Her; and, that the straitness of the Room might take off something from the envy of the thing, sometimes she
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:56771:315"/>
would eat her Junkets in a small Parlor, sometimes at <hi>David</hi>'s own Lodgings. But the Way she thus took to abate, did but increase, the Reflections, for it maintained Suspicions, and gave occasion to odd Discourses. Mens Thoughts were now inclin'd to the worst, and it serv'd to inflame them, That in Housholdstuff, in Apparel, and in the Number of brave and stately Horses, he exceeded even the King himself; and it made the matter look the worse, that all this Ornament did not credit his Face, but rather his Face spoil'd all this Ornament.</p>
            <p>But the Queen, not being able to amend the Faults of Nature, endeavour'd, by heaping Wealth and Honour upon him, to raise him up to the degree of the Nobles, that she might cover the Meanness of his Birth, and the Defects of his Body too, with the Vail of his lofty Promotions. But he was to be advanced by degrees, lest he might seem to be but a poor Mercenary Senator. The first Attempt was made, on the account of a piece of Land near <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> the <hi>Scots</hi> call it <note n="*" place="margin">A Castle on <hi>North-Esk,</hi> two Miles above <hi>Dalk<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Malvil:</hi> The Owner of the Land, his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-Law, and others, that were best able to persuade him, were sent for, and the Queen deals with the present Owner, to part with his Possessions; and she desir'd his Father-in-Law, and Friends, to persuade him to it: But this Matter not succeeding, the Queen took the Repulse, as an Affront to her; and, which was worse, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> took it very heinously, also. These Things being noised abroad, the Commonalty did bewail the sad State of Affairs, and expected that things would grow worse, if Men, eminent for their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, Estates and Credits, should be outed of their ancient Patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, to gratify the Lust of a beggarly Varlet; yea, many of the elder Sort call'd to mind, and told others of that time, when <hi>Cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burn</hi> wickedly slew the King's Brother; and, of a <hi>Stone-cutter,</hi> was made Earl of <hi>Marr,</hi> which rais'd up such a Fire of Civil War, that could not be extinguish'd, but by the Death of the King, and almost the Destruction of the Kingdom. These things were spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken openly, but Men in private did mutter much more, (as it useth to be in Matters not very creditable): Yet the King would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be persuaded to believe it, unless he saw it with his own Eyes; so that, one time, hearing,<note place="margin">The King, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

                  </gap> made sensible of <hi>Rizes</hi> scandalous Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity with the Queen, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy him.</note> that <hi>David</hi> was gone into the Queen's Bed-Chamber, he came to a little Door, of which he always carried the Key about him, and found it bolted in the inside, which it never us'd to be; he knock'd, no body answered; whereupon, concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving great Wrath and Indignation in his Heart, that Night he could not sleep. From that time forward, he consulted with some few of his Servants, (for he durst trust but a few, many of them having been corrupted by the Queen, and put upon him, rather as Spies of his Actions, than Attendants on his Person) how to rid <hi>David</hi> out of the way; they approved his Design, but could not find out a probable Way to effect it; that Consultation had been managed for some days, when other of his Servants, who were not of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacy, suspected the matter, and there being evident signs of it, they acquainted the Queen therewith, and told her, They would bring her to the place where they were, and they were as good as their Words; they observ'd and watch'd the opportunity, when others
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:56771:316"/>
were shut out, and the King had only his Confidents with him; the Queen, as if she were passing through his Chamber to her own, surprized him, with his Partisans; whereupon, she inveighed against him most bitterly, and highly threatned his Domesticks, telling them, all their Plots were in vain, she knew all their Minds and Actions, and would remedy them well enough, in time.</p>
            <p>Matters being brought to this pass, the King acquaints his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with his sad Condition; they both concluded, That the only Remedy for the present Malady, was, to reconcile that part of the Nobility which were present, and to recal those that were absent; but great haste was required in the thing, because the Day was near at hand, wherein the Queen resolved to condemn the Nobles that were absent, she having Indicted a Convention of the Estates for that purpose, against the Wills of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>English</hi> Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, who interceded in the Case: For they knew, that the Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed had committed no such heinous Offence; and besides, they fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saw the Danger that would insue.</p>
            <p>About the same time, the Queen of <hi>England</hi> sent her a very large and obliging Letter, full of prudent Advice, in reference to the present Estate of <hi>Scotland,</hi> endeavouring to incline her Kinswoman, from a wrathful, to a reconcilable Temper. The Nobility knew, that such Letters were come, and they guess'd at What the Contents were; and thereupon, the Queen counterfeited a civiller Respect to them than ordinary, and began to read them in the presence of many of them;<note place="margin">The Perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riness of <hi>Rize.</hi>
               </note> when she was in the middle, <hi>David</hi> stood up, and bid her, <hi>Read no more, she had read enough, she should stop</hi>; that Carriage of his seemed to them rather arrogant than new, for they knew, how imperiously he had carried it towards her heretofore, yea, and sometimes he would reprove her more sharply, than her own Husband ever durst do.</p>
            <p>At that time, the Cause of the Banish'd was hotly disputed in the Parliament-House; some, to gratify the Queen, would have the Punishment, due to Traitors, to be pass'd upon them; others contended, that they had done nothing worthy to be so severely treated. In the mean time, <hi>David</hi> went about to all of them, one by one, to feel their pulses, what each ones Vote would be concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Exiles, if he was chosen <note n="â€–" place="margin">Or, <hi>President.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Speaker,</hi> by the rest of the Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; he told them plainly, the Queen was resolved to have them condemn'd, and 'twas in vain for any of them to contend against it; and besides, he would be sure to incur the Queen's Displeasure thereby. His Design in this, was, partly to confound the weaker Spirits betwixt Hope and Fear, and partly to exclude the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd out of the number of the Judges select, or Lords of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles; or, at least, that the major Part might be of such a Gizard, as would please the Queen. This audacious Improbity of so mean a Fellow, was fear'd by some, and hated by all. Whereupon, the King, by his Father's Advice, sent for <hi>Iames Douglas,</hi> and <hi>Patrick Lindsy,</hi> his Kinsmen, one by the Father, the other by the Mother's side; they advise with <hi>Patrick Ruven,</hi> an able Man both for Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and Execution, but he was so weakned with a lasting Disease, that, for some Months, he could not rise out of his Bed; however,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:56771:316"/>
they were willing to trust him, amongst some few others, in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of so great Concernment, both by reason of his great Prudence, and also because his Children were Cousin-Germans to the King. The King was told by them, what a great Error he had committed before, in suffering his Kinsmen and Friends to be driven from Court, in favour of such a base Rascal, as <hi>Rize</hi>; yea, he himself did, in effect, thrust them out from the Court with his own Hands, and so had advanced such a contemptible Mushroom, that now he himself was despised by him; they had also much other Discourse concerning the State of the Publick: The King was quickly brought to acknowledg his Fault, and to promise to act nothing for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, without the Consent of the Nobility.</p>
            <p>But those wise and experienc'd Counsellors thought it not safe to trust the verbal Promises of an Uxorious young Man, as believing, that he might, in time, be enticed by his Wife, to deny this Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation, to their certain Ruin; and therefore they drew up the Heads of their Contract in Writing, to which he willingly and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly subscribed: The Heads were,
<q>For the establishing Religion,<note place="margin">Articles of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the King and the Nobles, for the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Rize,</hi> &amp;c.</note> as 'twas provided for at the Queen's Return to <hi>Scotland</hi>; To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the Persons, lately banished, because their Country could not well want their Service; To destroy <hi>David,</hi> for as long as he was alive, the King could not maintain his Dignity, nor the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility be in Safety.</q>
They all set their Hands to this Schedule, wherein the King professing himself the Author of the Homicide, they resolved presently to attempt the Fact, both to prevent the Condemnation of the absent Nobles, and also, lest Delay might discover their Design. And therefore, when the Queen was at Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, in a narrow private Room, the Earl of <hi>Argyle</hi>'s Wife and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> sitting with her, as they were wont, and there were but a few Attendants, for the Room would not hold many, <hi>Iames Douglas,</hi> Earl of <hi>Morton,</hi> with a great number of his Friends, were walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in an outward Chamber, their faithful Friends and Vassals were commanded to stay below in the Yard, to quiet the Tumult, if any should be. The King comes out of his own Chamber, which was below the Queen's, and goes up to her by a narrow pair of Stairs, which were open to none, but himself; <hi>Patrick Ruven</hi> follow'd him arm'd, with but four or five Companions, at most; they entred into the Closet, where they were at Supper, and the Queen, being some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing mov'd at that unusual Appearance of arm'd Men, and also perceiving <hi>Ruven,</hi> in an uncouth posture, and lean by reason of his late Disease, and yet in his Armour, asked him, What was the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? for the Spectators thought, that his Feaver had disturb'd his Head, and put him besides himself. He commanded <hi>David</hi> to rise, and come forth, for the Place, he sat in, was not fit for him; the Queen presently rose, and sought to defend him by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal of her Body, but the King took her in his Arms, and bid her to be of good chear, they would do her no hurt, <hi>only the Death of that Villain was resolved on</hi>; they haled <hi>David</hi> out into the next,<note place="margin">

Hereupon, a Tumult arose all over the House, and the Earls of <hi>Huntly, Athol,</hi> and <hi>Bothwel,</hi> who were at Supper in another part of the Palace, were rushing out, but they were kept within their Chamber, by those who guarded the Courts below, and had no harm done them. <hi>Ruven</hi> went out of that Privy-room into the Queen's Bed-Chamber, where, not being able to stand, he sat down, and called for something to drink; Whereupon, the Queen fell upon him, with such Words, as her present Grief and Fury suggested to her, calling him a Perfidious Traitor, and ask'd him, How he durst be so bold, as to speak to her, sitting, whereas she her self stood; he excus'd it, as not done out of Pride, but Weakness of Body;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ruven</hi>'s memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Speech to the Queen, on the occasion of <hi>Rize</hi>'s Death.</note> but advis'd her,
<q>That in managing the Affairs of the Kingdom, she would rather consult the Nobility, who had a Concern in the Publick, than vagrant Rascals, who could give no Pledg for their Faithfulness, and who had nothing to lose, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Estate or Credit; neither was the Fact, then committed, without a Precedent: That <hi>Scotland</hi> was a Kingdom bounded by Laws, and was never wont to be govern'd by the Will and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of one Man, but by the Rule of the Law, and the Consent of the Nobility; and if any former King had done otherwise, he had smarted severely for it: Neither were the <hi>Scots</hi> at present so far degenerated from their Ancestors, as to bear not only the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, but even the Servitude, of a Stranger, who was scarce worthy to be their Slave.</q>
The Queen was more inraged at this Speech, than before: Whereupon, they departed, having plac'd Guards in all convenient Places, that no Tumult might arise.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the News was carried all over the Town, and as every ones Disposition was, right or wrong, they took Arms, and went to the Palace: There the King shewed himself to them out of a Window, and told the Multitude, That He, and the Queen were safe,<note place="margin">The King takes <hi>Rize</hi>'s Death upon himself.</note> and there was no cause for their tumultuous Assembly; What was done, was by his Command, and what that was, they should know in time, and therefore, at present, every one should go to his own House: Upon which Command they withdrew, except some few, that staid to keep Guard. The next day in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Nobles that return'd from <hi>England,</hi> offer'd themselves
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:56771:317"/>
to the <note n="â€ " place="margin">The banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Nobles of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer themselves to their Trial.</note> Trial in the Town-hall, being ready to plead their Cause, for That was the day appointed; but no body appearing against them, they there openly protested, That it was not their Fault, for they were ready to submit to a Legal Trial, and so every one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to his own Lodging. The Queen sent for her Brother, and, after a long Conference with him, she gave him hopes, That, ever after, she would commit her self to the Nobles. Hereupon, the Guards were slackn'd; though many thought, this her Clemency did presage no Good to the Publick, for she gathered together the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers of her old Guard, and went through a back Gate by Night, with <hi>George Seton,</hi> who attended with 200 Horse, first to his Castle, then to <hi>Dunbar</hi>; she carried also the King along with her, who, for fear of his Life, was forc'd to obey. There she gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Force together, and, pretending a Reconcilement to those who were lately returned from Banishment, she turn'd her Fury upon the Murderers of <hi>David,</hi> but they, yeilding to the time, shifted for themselves, and so, having settled Matters, she return'd to her old Disposition. First of all, she caus'd <note n="â€–" place="margin">

As for her Husband, she threatned him, and obliquely in her Discourses scoff'd at him, doing her Endeavour to take away all Power from him, and to render him as contemptible, as she could.</p>

A few days after, the Queen re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and because, it seems, she would avoid the Croud of People, she went not to her own Palace, but to the House of a private Man in the Vicinage: From thence she went to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, where the annual Convention, call'd the <hi>Exchequer-Court,</hi> was then held, not so much for the Largeness of the House, or the Pleasure of the Gardens, as, that one <hi>David Chalmers,</hi> a Creature of <hi>Bothwel</hi>'s, had an house near it, whose back-Door was contiguous to the Queen's Garden, by which <hi>Bothwel</hi> might pass in and out to her, as often as he pleased.

When the King heard of it, he went in great haste to <hi>Iedburgh,</hi> both to give her a Visit, and to testify his Observance by all the good Offices he could; and also to incline her to a better course of Life, hoping, she might repent of what she had done; as, in great Dangers, Persons are wont to do: She, on the contrary, gave not the least Evidence of a recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil'd Mind, but charged, that no body should rise up, or salute him, as he came in, or give him Entertainment, so much as one Night: But she, suspecting the Disposition of <hi>Murray,</hi> as courteous and civil, dealt with his Wife to make haste now, to fain her self sick, and go immediately to Bed, that so, by the pretence of Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, the King might be excluded from thence; yea, she made it her business, to inforce him to be gone for want of Lodging; which he had done, unless one of the Family of the <hi>Humes,</hi> for ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry shame, had pretended a sudden cause for his Departure, and so left his Lodging free for the King.</p>
            <p>The next day in the Morning, She returned again to <hi>Sterlin,</hi> her Return was the more reflected on, because, at the very same time, <hi>Bothwel</hi> was carried out of the place where he lodg'd, to the Queen's Lodgings, in the face of all the People, and though nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them were well recovered, She from her Disease, He from his Wounds, yet they journyed first to <hi>Kelso,</hi> then to <hi>Coldingham</hi>; next, to <hi>Cragmiller,</hi> (a Castle two Miles from <hi>Edinburgh</hi>) not caring for the Reports that were spred of them by the way. The Queen, in all her Discourse, profess'd, that She could never live, unless She were divorc'd from the King; and if She might not be so, She would lay violent Hands on her self.

               <pb n="186" facs="tcp:56771:319"/>A little before Winter, when the Embassadors from <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England</hi> came to be Witnesses at the Baptism of the Prince, the Queen strove, both by pecuniary, and all other industrious, ways, That <hi>Bothwel</hi> should appear the most magnificent amongst all her Subjects and Guests at the Entertainment, whereas her lawful Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,<note place="margin">Strange Disre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to the King, at the Baptism of his own Son.</note> at the Baptism, was not allowed Necessaries; yea, was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid to come in sight of the Embassadors, his Servants also, appointed for his daily Attendants, were taken from him, and the Nobility forbid to observe him: But this Carriage, and her Comportment in former times, the more implacable she was towards him, made them more to pity him, in seeing a young and harmless Person re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachfully used; and yet not only to bear it patiently, but even to endeavour to appease her Rage by the servilest Offices, he could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form; that so he might win some Degree of her Favour. As for his Apparel and Dress, she put the Fault upon the Embroiderers, Goldsmiths and other Tradesmen, though 'twas but a false shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Pretence, for, every body knew, it was her own occasion; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as for <hi>Bothwel</hi>'s Ornaments, she wrought many of them with her own Hands. Besides, Foreign Embassadors were advised, not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into Discourse with the King, though they were in the same Castle together, the most part of the Day.</p>
            <p>The young Gentleman, being thus uncourteously treated, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to the Contempt of all, and his Rival honoured before his Face,<note place="margin">Thereupon he withdraws from Court;</note> resolved to go to his Father, to <hi>Glasgow,</hi> who, as some thought, had sent for him. The Queen shew'd her accustomed Hatred at his Departure, she took away all the Silver Plate, which he had used ever since he was married, and put Pewter in their stead; besides, she gave him Poison before his Departure, that so the Evil might be more secret,<note place="margin">Is poisoned, but</note> if he died, when absent from Court. But the Poison wrought sooner, than those, who gave it, supposed it would; for, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was gone a Mile from <hi>Sterlin,</hi> he had such a grievous Pain all over his Body, that 'twas very apparent, his Disease was not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual, but fraudulently design'd; but, as soon as he came to <hi>Glasgow,</hi> the Mischief did manifestly discover it self; blew Pustules arose all over his Body, with so much Pain and Torment, that there was little hope of his Life; <hi>Iames Abernethy,</hi> an able, faithful and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienc'd, Physician, being consulted about his Disease, answered pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently, That he had taken Poison: He sent for the Queen's Domestick Physician, but the Queen would not suffer him to go, fearing, left his Skill might cure him, and also she was not willing, that Many should know of his being poison'd. When the Ceremonies of the Baptism were over, and the Company, by degrees, gone home; the Queen was private with <hi>Bothwel,</hi> scarce any body besides at <hi>Drummond</hi> and <hi>Tillibardin,</hi> a Noble-Man's House, where she spent two days about the beginning of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> and so return'd to <hi>Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi> and pretended daily to go to <hi>Glasgow,</hi> but expecting to hear every day of the King's Death; to prevent the worst, she resolved to have her Son in her own Power; and, that her Design might oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion no Suspicion, they began to find fault, That the House, wherein he was kept, was inconvenient; That in such a moist and cold place, he might be subject to <hi>Rheums,</hi> but the true cause was
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:56771:319"/>
far otherwise of his Removal, for, 'twas very plain, That the Place, whither he was carried, was far more obnoxious, upon the foresaid Accounts, in being scituate in a low Marish Soil, having a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain betwixt it and the Sun-rising; whereupon the Child, being scarce seven Months old, was brought in a very sharp Winter to <hi>Edinburgh</hi>; when she there heard that the King was recovered, as having overcome the Poison, by the Vigour of his Youth,<note place="margin">overcomes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> by the Vigour of his Youth.</note> and the Strength of his Natural Constitution, she renew'd her Plot to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy him, acquainting also some of the Nobility therewith. In the mean time, News was brought her, that the King design'd to fly to <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Spain,</hi> and that he had spoke about it with the Master of an <hi>English</hi> Ship, which was then in the <hi>Firth</hi> of <hi>Clyde</hi>; hereupon, some thought, That an occasion was offered her to send for him, and if he refused to come, to kill him out of the way; yea,<note place="margin">The Story of the Infernal Design to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy <hi>Henry Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>art,</hi> King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plotted, with the Series of its Procedure.</note> some offered to be Agents in the thing; all of them advised, That the Fact should be privately committed, and That it should be hastned, before he was perfectly recovered: The Queen, having already got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten her Son, that she might also have her Husband, in her Power, though not as yet agreed in the Design, how he should be dispatch'd, resolv'd to go to <hi>Glasgow,</hi> having, as she thought, sufficiently clear'd her self from his former Suspicions by many kind Letters she had lately sent him: But her Words and Deeds did not agree; for, she took almost none with her in her Retinue, but the <hi>Hamiltons,</hi> and other Hereditary Enemies of the King. In the mean time, she in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusts <hi>Bothwel</hi> with doing What was contributory to the Design at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> for that Place seem'd most convenient to them, both to commit, and also to conceal, so great a Wickedness; for there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a great Assembly of the Nobles, the Suspicion might be put off from one to the other, and so divided between Many. When the Queen had tried all the ways she could, to dissemble her Hatred: At last, by many Chidings, Complaints and Lamentations, past be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, she could yet scarce make him believe, that she was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to him. The King, hardly yet recover'd from his Disease, was brought in a Litter to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> to the Place design'd for his Murder, which <hi>Bothwel,</hi> in the Queen's Absence, had undertook to provide, and That was, an House uninhabited for some Years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, near the Walls of the City, in a lonesome solitary place, between the Ruins of two Churches, where no Noise or Outcry could be heard; thither he was thrust with a few Attendants only, for the most of them (being such, as the Queen had put upon him, rather as Spies than Servants) were departed, as foreknowing the Danger at hand; and Those that remained, could not get the Keys of the Door from the Harbingers, that provided the Lodgings.</p>
            <p>The Queen was most intent on this One thing, to avert all Suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion from her self; and her Dissimulation had proceded so far, That the King was fully persuaded, there was a firm Reconcilement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them: So that he wrote Letters to his Father, who staid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, sick at <hi>Glasgow,</hi> giving him great Hopes and Assurance, That the Queen was now sincerely His, and, commemorating her many good Offices towards him, now he promised to himself, That there would be a Change of all things for the better. As he was writing
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:56771:320"/>
these Letters, the Queen came in on a sudden, and, reading them, she gave him many Embraces and Kisses, telling him, that Sight mightily pleased her, that now she saw, there was no Cloud of Sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion hovering over his Mind.</p>
            <p>Things being thus well secured on that side, her next care was, to contrive, as much as possible, to cast the Guilt upon Another, and therefore she sent for her Brother <hi>Murray,</hi> who had lately ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained leave, and was going to St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> to visit his Wife, who lay there (as he heard) dangerously sick. For, besides the Danger of Child-bearing, she had Pustles, that rose all over her Body, with a violent Feaver; the Cause of her detaining him, she pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be, that she might honourably dismiss the Duke of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy's</hi> Embassador, who came too late to the Prince's Baptism; though this seem'd a mean pretence to take him off from so just and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary a Duty, yet he obeyed. In the Interim, the Queen every day made her Visits to the King, and reconciled him to <hi>Bothwel,</hi> whom, she, by all means, desired to be out of Gun-shot of any Sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion: She made him large Promises of her Affection for the time to come, which over-officious Carriage, though suspected by all, yet no Man was so bold as to advise the King of his Danger, in regard he was wont to tell the Queen, whatever he heard, to insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate the more into her Favour; only <hi>Robert,</hi> the Queen's Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, mov'd either with the Horridness of the Fact, or with Pity to the young Man, took the Confidence to acquaint him of his Wives Plot against him, but on this condition, That he would keep it to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and provide for his Safety, the best he could. The King, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, reveal'd it to the Queen, according to his custom; whereupon <hi>Robert</hi> was call'd for, and he stoutly deny'd it, so that, they gave one another the Lie, and were laying their Hands on their Swords. The Queen was glad to see, That her Designs were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to have so good a Conclusion, and that so near at hand, without her Trouble, and therefore she calls for her other Brother, <hi>Iames,</hi> as if he were to decide the Controversy; but the Truth was, That he also might, on that occasion, be cut off; there was no body present but <hi>Bothwel,</hi> who was so far from keeping them from fighting, that he would rather have kill'd him, that had the worst of the Combate himself, as plainly appeared, when he said, There was no reason, <hi>Iames</hi> should be sent for in such haste, to keep those from Duelling, who, whatsoever they pretended, had no such Maw to it. This stir being quieted, the Queen and <hi>Bothwel</hi> were wholly intent, how to perpetrate the Murder; and how to do it, with all ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable Privacy, too. The Queen, to dissemble both Love to her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and an Amnesty of old Offences, causes her Bed to be brought, from the Palace, into a Chamber below the King's, where she lay, after she had sat late up with him, in Discourse, for some Nights.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, she devises all manner of ways, to cast the <hi>Odium</hi> of the Fact, when committed, upon her Brother <hi>Iames,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Morton</hi>; for, she thought, if those Two, whose Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Esteem was much fear'd and hated by her, were taken out of the way, all things else would fall in of themselves: She was
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:56771:320"/>
also incited thereunto, by Letters from the Pope, and from <hi>Charles,</hi> Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain.</hi> For, the Summer before, having, by her Uncle, desir'd a Sum of Mony from the Pope, for levying an Army to disturb the State of Religion in <hi>Britain,</hi> and the Pope more cunningly, but the Cardinal plainly, had advis'd her to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy those, who were the greatest Hindrances to the Restitution of Popery, and especially Those two Earls by Name; if they were once taken off, they promised a Mass of Mony for the War. Some Inckling hereof, the Queen thought, was come to the Ears of the Nobility; and therefore, to clear her self from any Suspicion, or the least Inclination to such a thing, she shewed them the Letters. But these Designs, so subtilly laid, as they thought, were somewhat disturbed by often Messages from <hi>Murray</hi>'s Wife, how that she had miscarried, and that there were small hopes of her Life. This Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage was brought him on the <hi>Lord's Day,</hi> as he was going to Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon; whereupon, he returned back to the Queen, and desired leave of her to be gone; she very much urg'd him, to stay one day longer, to hear certainer News, alleging, That if he made never so much haste, his Coming would do her no good; but, if her Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease did abate, to morrow would be time enough; but he was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bent on his Journy, and went his way. The Queen had deferr'd the Murder till that Night, and would seem to be so jocund and dissolute, as to celebrate the Marriage of <hi>Sebastian,</hi> one of her Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick, in the very Palace, and when the Evening was past in Mirth and Jollity, then she went with a numerous Attendance, to see her Husband; she spent some hours with him, and was merrier than formerly, often kissing him, and giving him a Ring, as a Token of her Love. After the Queen's Departure, the King, with the few Servants that were about him, recollecting the Proceedings of the Day past, amongst some comfortable Speeches given him by the Queen, he was much troubled at the remembrance of a few Words; for she, whether, not being able to contain her Joy, arising from the Hope, that the Murder would be now acted; or, whether it fell from her by chance, cast out a word, <hi>That</hi> David Rize <hi>was slain the last Year, just about that time.</hi> This unseasonable mention of his Death, tho none of them lik'd it, yet, because much of the Night was past, and the next Morning was design'd for Sports and Pastimes, they went speedily to Bed. In the mean time, Gunpowder was plac'd in the Room below, to blow up the House; other things were cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiously and craftily enough transacted, yet, in a small matter, they lest a track, whereby to be discovered. For the Bed, in which the Queen us'd sometimes to lie, was taken from thence, and a worse put in its place, as if, though they were prodigal enough of their Credit, yet they would spare a little Mony. In the mean time, one <hi>Paris,</hi> a <hi>French</hi> Man, a Partisan in the Conspiracy, entred into the King's Bed-Chamber, and there stood still, yet so, that the Queen might see him, That was the Sign agreed on betwixt them, that all things were in a readiness. As soon as she saw <hi>Paris,</hi> as if <hi>Sebastian</hi>'s Marriage came into her Mind, she began to blame her self, that she had bin so negligent, as not to dance that night at the Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, (as 'twas agreed) and to put the Bride to Bed, as the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:56771:321"/>
is; whereupon, she presently started up, and went home. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing returned to the Palace, she had a pretty deal of Discourse with <hi>Bothwel,</hi> who being, at length, dismiss'd, went to his Chamber, chang'd his Apparel, put on a Souldier's Coat, and, with a few in his Company, pass'd through the Guards into the Town; Two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Parties, of the Conspirators, came several ways to the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Place, and a few of them entred into the King's Bed-Chamber, of which they had the Keys, (as I said before) and whilst he was fast asleep, they took him by the Throat, and strangled him, and one also of his Servants,<note place="margin">The King strangled,</note> who lay near him: When they were slain, they carried their Bodies through a little Gate, which they had made on purpose, in the Walls of the City, into a Garden near hand;<note place="margin">And then the House, wherein he was, blown up with Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder.</note> then they set fire to the Gunpowder, which blew up the House from the very Foundation, and made such a Noise, that it shook some of the neighbouring Houses; yea, those, that were sound asleep in the furthest parts of the City, were awakened, and frighted at the Noise. When the Deed was done, <hi>Bothwel</hi> was let out by the Ruins of the City-Walls, and so return'd to the Palace, through the Guard, another way, than that he came. This was the common Report about the King's Death, which held some Days. The Queen had sat up that Night, to wait for the Event, and, hearing of the Tumult, called together those of the Nobility, who were at Court, and amongst the rest, <hi>Bothwel</hi>; and, by their Advice, sent out to know, What was the matter, as if she had been ignorant of all that was done; some went to inspect the Body, the King had only a linen Shirt on the upper part of his Body, the rest of it lay naked; his other Apparel, and his Shoes, lay near him: The Common People came, in great Multitudes, to see him, and many Conjectures there were, yet they all agreed, (sorely against <hi>Bothwel</hi>'s Mind) That he could never be thrown out of the House, by the Force of the Gunpowder, for there was no part broken, bruis'd, or black and blew, about his Body, which, in a Ruin by Gunpow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, would have been; besides, his Apparel lying near him, was not sing'd with the Flame, or covered with any Ashes; so that, it could not be thrown thither, by any Casualty, but plac'd there on purpose, by some bodies Hand. <hi>Bothwel</hi> returned home, and, as if he had been in great Admiration, brought the News to the Queen, whereupon she went to Bed, and lay secure, soundly asleep, a great part of the next Day.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, Reports were spread abroad by the <hi>Parricides,</hi> and carried into the Borders of <hi>England</hi> before day, That the King was Murdered by the design of <hi>Murray</hi> and <hi>Morton</hi>; yet every Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy thought, privately within himself, That the Queen must needs be the Author of the Murder.

It increast Mens suspicions of him, because, at that time, he had retir'd to the House of his Brother, the Earl of

               <hi>Arran,</hi> which was near to the House, where the King was slain: Whereas, before, he always us'd to live in some Eminent part of the City; where he might conveniently receive Visits, and curry Favour with the People, by Feasting them; and besides, Lights were seen in his House, and a Watch all the Night, from the upper part of the City, and when the design'd Powder-Clap was, then the Lights were put out, and his Vassals,<note place="margin">The Assassi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </note> many of whom watch'd in their Arms, were forbidden to go out of Doors: But the true Story of the matter of Fact, which broke out, after some Months, gave occasion to People to look upon those things as certain In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications, which before were but Suspicions only.</p>
            <p>When the Murder was committed, presently Messengers were sent into <hi>England,</hi> who were to Report, That the King of <hi>Scots</hi> was cruelly Murdered by his Subjects, by the contrivance, especially, of <hi>Murray</hi> and <hi>Morton.</hi> The News was presently brought to Court,<note place="margin">The <hi>English</hi> inflamed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Scots,</hi> upon hearing the horrid Murder of their King.</note> which so inflam'd all the <hi>English</hi> to the hatred of the whole Nation, that, for some days, no <hi>Scots</hi> Man durst walk abroad, without Danger of his Life; and, tho many Letters past to and fro, discovering the secret Contrivances of the Design, yet they could hardly be appeas'd. The King's Body, having been left a while as a Spectacle to be gaz'd upon, and a great Concourse of People continually stockt thither, the Queen order'd, That it should be laid on a Form or Bier turn'd upside down, and brought by Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into the Palace. There she her Self viewed the Body, the fairest of that Age, and yet her Countenance discover'd not the secrets of her Mind, neither one way or other. The Nobles there present Decreed, that a Royal and Magnificent Funeral should be made for him: But the Queen caus'd him to be carry'd forth by Bearers in the Night, to be buried in no manner of State; and that which increas'd the Indignity the more, was, that his Grave was made near <hi>David Rizes</hi>; as if she design'd to Sacrifice the Life of her Husband to the Ghost of that filthy Varlet.</p>
            <p>There were Two Prodigies hapning at that time,<note place="margin">Prodigies ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying the King's death.</note> which are worth the while to relate: One of them a little preceded the Murder, it was This; One <hi>Iames Londin,</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Fife,</hi> having been long Sick of a Feaver, the day before the King was kill'd, about Noon, lifted up himself a little out of his Bed, and, as if he had been astonish'd, cry'd out to those that stood by him, with a loud Voice, <hi>to go help the King, for the Parricides was just now Murdering him</hi>; and a while after, he call'd out with a mournful Tone, <hi>Now 'tis too late to help, he is already Slain:</hi> and he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self lived not long after he had utter'd those Words. The Other did accompany the Murder it self. Three of the familiar Friends of the Earl of <hi>Athol</hi>'s, the King's Cousin, Men of Reputation for Valour and Estate, had their Lodgings, not far from the King's; when they were asleep about Midnight, there was a certain Man seem'd to come to <hi>Dugal Stuart,</hi> who lay next the Wall, and to draw his Hand gently over his Beard and Cheek, so to awake him, saying, <hi>Arise, they are off'ring Violence to us.</hi> He presently awak'd, and considering the Apparition within himself: Another of them cries out presently in the same Bed, <hi>Who kicks me? Dugal</hi> answer'd,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:56771:322"/>
perhaps, 'tis a Cat, which us'd to walk about in the Night; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, the 3<hi>d</hi> which was not yet awake, rose presently out of his Bed, and was going to run away, demanding, <hi>Who it was that had given him a box on the Ear?</hi> as soon as he had spoken it, one seem'd to go out of the House by the Door, not without some Noise. Whilst they were descanting on what they had heard and seen, The noise of the King's House, that was blown up, drove them all into a great Fright. He that took the Murder most heinously, was, <hi>Iohn Stuart</hi> Earl of <hi>Athol,</hi> as for other Reasons, so, because he was the chief Maker of the Match between the Queen and him. The Night after the Murder, arm'd Guards watch'd the Palace at Night, as in such sudden Consternations is usual, and they hearing the outside Wall of the Earl of <hi>Athols</hi> Lodging make a Noise or Crack, as if some were gently digging at the Foundation, they rais'd the Family, which went no more to Bed, that Night: The day after, the Earl went into the Town, and a little after that, went home, for fear of his Life. The Earl of <hi>Murray,</hi> at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to Court from St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> was not without danger neither, for arm'd Men walkt about his House at Night; but he not being well, and his Servants thereupon using to watch with him all Night, the Villains could not attempt any thing privately a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, and openly they durst not. At length <hi>Bothwel</hi> (who would willingly have been freed from such a trouble) resolved to perform the wicked Fact,<note place="margin">

               </note> with his own Hands. And therefore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Midnight, he askt his Domesticks, how <hi>Murray</hi> did? They told him, he was grievously troubled with the Gout: What, said he, if we should go see him? and presently he rose up, and was hastening to his House. As he was going, he was inform'd by his Domesticks, that he was gone to his Brother <hi>Roberts,</hi> to be at more Freedom and Ease, out of the Noise of the Court, whereupon he held his Peace, stood still, grieving, that he had lost so fair an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, and so return'd home. The Queen, mean while, look'd very demurely, and, dissembling great Sorrow, thought That way to reconcile the People to her; but that speeded as ill with her, as the rest of the Conspiracy. For, whereas it was the Custom, time out of Mind, for Queens, after their Husbands Death, to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain several Days, not only from the sight of Men, but even from seeing the Light, she indeed personated a fain'd Grief, but her Joy did so exceed it, that, thÃ´ the Doors were shut, yet the Windows were open, and casting off her mourning Weeds, in 4 days, she could well enough bear the sight of the Sun and Air: And before 12 days were over, her Mind was harden'd against the talks of the People, and she went to <hi>Seton,</hi> about 7 Miles from the Town, <hi>Bothwel</hi> never departing from her side; there her Carriage was such, that she seemed somewhat chang'd in the Apparel of her Body, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all in the habit of her Mind. The Place was full of the Nobility, and she went daily abroad to the accustom'd Sports, thÃ´ some of them were not so fit for the Female Sex: But the coming of Mr. <hi>D'Crocke,</hi>

               </note> they pretended they were wholly ignorant of what was done, and wondred at it, as a new, unheard of, and incredible, Thing; then, they proceeded to the Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of it; they summon in some poor Women out of the Neighbourhood, but they stuck betwixt Hope and Fear, being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, Whether they should speak, or hold their Peace; but, tho they were very cautious in their Words, yet, uttering more than was expected, they were sent away, as having spoken nothing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any certain ground; and, as for their Testimony, it was easy enough to despise it: Whereupon, some of the King's Servants were sent for, whom the Fire had not destroyed; They, being ask'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Ingress of the Assassinates? reply'd, That the Keys were not in their Power; it being urg'd upon them again, In whose, then? They answered, The Queens; Whereupon, the further Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination was put off, as they pretended; but, indeed, was quite supprest, for they were afraid, if they went any further, the Court-Secrets would have been all publickly known.</p>
            <p>And yet, to set a Gloss on the Matter,<note place="margin">A Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion published, for a Blind, to discover the King's Murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</note> a Proclamation was publish'd, and a pecuniary Reward offer'd to the Discoverers of the King's Murder. But, Who dar'd be so bold as to impeach <hi>Bothwel,</hi> seeing he was to be the Impleaded, the Judge, the Examiner, and the Exactor of the punishment, too? Yet this fear, which stopt the Mouths of divers single Persons, could not bridle the Multitude. For Libels were publish'd, Pictures made, and Night-haukings and Cries were uttered, whereby the Parricides might easily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, That their whole Design was discover'd, Who design'd the Wickedness, and Who assisted in the Execution thereof: And the Commonalty, the more they were forbidden, the more did their Grief make them speak. Though the Conspirators seem'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise these things, yet they were so inwardly prickt and grip'd, that they could not dissemble their sorrow: And therefore omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Examination about the King's Death, they fell upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Guest, more severe; and That was, against the Authors of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, or, (as they worded it) the Calumniators of <hi>Bothwel,</hi> and this was so severely prosecuted, that no Pains nor Cost were spar'd therein; all the Painters and Writing-Masters were call'd in, that so they might discover the Pictures and Libels, by those that drew or wrote them; they further added a Clause, suitable enough to the Edict, which made it Capital, not only to sell, but even to read them, when they were Sold. But they, who endeavour'd to bridle the Discourse of the People, by threatning Capital Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to them, were not satisfi'd with the King's Death, but retain'd their hatred against him, though in his grave. The Queen gave her Husband's Goods, his Arms, Horses, Apparel, and other Hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdstuff,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:56771:323"/>
either to his Father's Enemies, or to the Murderers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, as if they had been forfeited into her Exchequer. As these Matters were acted openly, so many did as publickly inveigh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them:<note place="margin">The bold Speech of a Taylor.</note> So that one Taylor, who was about to fit some of the King's Clothes for <hi>Bothwel</hi>'s Body, was so bold, as to say; Now he saw the old Country-Custom verifi'd: <hi>That the Executioner had the Apparel of those, that suffer'd by his Hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was also another Care troubled them, How they might get the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> into the Queen's Hands; <hi>Iohn,</hi> Earl of <hi>Marr,</hi> was Governour of it, upon Condition, that he should render it to none, but by Order of the Estates; and though such a Convention was to be the Month after,<note place="margin">The Queen solicitous to procure the Government of <hi>Edinburgh</hi>-Castle into her own Hands.</note> yet the Queen was so ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, that every small delay seem'd very tedious to Her. And therefore she dealt with the Earl's Friends and Kindred, (for he himself lay then very sick at <hi>Sterlin</hi>) to surrender the Castle to Her; pretending This as the chief Cause, That the Commons of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> were so tumultuous, (there being then a Commotion amongst them) That she could not keep them within the Bounds of their Duty, unless she had that Fort in her Hands; and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, as an Earnest of her great Affection to <hi>Iohn,</hi> she would put her only Son, the Heir of the Kingdom, into his Hands, to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducated by him; which Office of Guardianship, his Ancestors had discharg'd to their great Commendation, as in so many other Princes, of late Times, in her Mother and Grandfathers Education. Tho the Earl understood, whither her Promises and Flatteries did tend, yet he complied with her Request. The Queen, finding him more facile than she hoped, essays next to be possest of the Castle, as soon as it was convenient; and yet to keep her Son too: When he would not hearken to that, she sets upon him by another Wile, propounding to him to come to <hi>Linlithgo,</hi> (in the Mid-way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Edinburgh</hi> and <hi>Sterlin</hi>) and there, on an appointed Day, to receive the Prince, and to surrender the Castle. But this Project being suspected of Fraud, at last it was agreed, That he should be deliver'd to <hi>Erskin</hi> at <hi>Sterlin,</hi> and That he, in the interim, should give the chief of his Family in Hostage, for the rendring of the Castle.</p>
            <p>These things were some trouble to the Parricides, but they were most of all troubled with the daily complaints of the Earl of <hi>Len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nox</hi>;<note place="margin">The Earl of <hi>Lennox</hi> first publickly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuses <hi>Bothwel</hi> of the King's Murder.</note> He would not adventure to come to Court, by reason of <hi>Both<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi>'s Power, accompanied with the highest Luxury; but he earnestly solicited the Queen by Letters, That she would commit <hi>Bothwel</hi> to Prison, who, without doubt, was the Author of the King's Murder, till a Day might be appointed to bring him to his Trial. She, though eluding his desire by many Stratagems, yet, seeing the Examination of so heinous a Fact could not be avoided, design'd to have it carried on, thus.</p>
            <p>The Assembly of the Estates, on the <hi>Ides</hi> of <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>April.</hi> 15.</note> 
               <hi>April,</hi> was near at hand; before that time, she was willing to have the matter tried, that so <hi>Bothwel,</hi> being absolv'd by the Votes of the Judges, might be further clear'd by the Suffrages of the whole Parliament. This haste was the cause, that nothing was carried on orderly, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:56771:323"/>
to ancient Custom, in that judiciary Process. For, the Accusers (as is usual) ought to have been Cited,<note place="margin">Whereupon a Court is hasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly summon'd;</note> with their Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, as Wife, Father, Mother, Son, either to appear Personally, or, by Proxy, within 40 Days, for that is the time limited by the Law. Here, the Father was only summon'd to appear, <hi>April</hi> 13<hi>th,</hi> without summoning any of his Friends, only his own Family, which, at that Time, was in a low Estate, and reduc'd but to a Few; Whereas, in the mean time, <hi>Bothwel</hi> flew up and down the Town, with a great many Troops at his heels; The Earl of <hi>Lennox</hi> thought it best for him not to come into a City full of his Enemies, where he had no Friends nor Vassals to secure him; and besides, if there were no Danger of Life, yet there could be no freedom of Debate. <hi>Bothwel</hi> appears at the Day appointed, and comes into the Town-Hall, being both Plaintiff and Defendant too. The Judges of the Nobility were call'd over, most of them his Friends, none daring to appear on the other side to except against any one of them; only <hi>Robert Cuningham,</hi> one of <hi>Lennox</hi>'s Family, gave a small stop to the Proceedings; He, having Liberty to speak openly, declar'd, That the Process was not according to Law, nor Custom, where the accus'd Person was so powerful, that he could not be brought to Punishment, and the Accuser was absent for fear of his Life. And therefore, Whatsoever should be determin'd there, as being against Lavv and Right, vvas Null and Void; yet, they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted in their Design, notwithstanding. Moreover, <hi>Gilbert</hi> Earl of <hi>Cassils,</hi> being chosen one of the Judges, rather for Forms sake, than that he thought he should do any Good, desir'd to be excused, and offered also to pay the Forfeiture, usually taken of those vvho decline Sitting; vvhen presently a Messenger brought him a Ring from the Queen, vvith a Command, that he should sit as one of the Judges, or else, she threatned to commit him to Prison. When that did not prevail, she sent another Messenger, vvho told him, he should be punish'd as a Traitor, if he refus'd; so that, by such kind of Terrors, they were inforc'd to sit, and the Issue vvas; They declar'd,<note place="margin">By which <hi>Bothwel</hi> is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted, tho but Condition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally.</note> they saw no Reason to find <hi>Bothwel</hi> Guilty; yet, if any Man hereafter could lawfully accuse him, they gave a Caution, That this Judgment should be no hindrance to him. Some thought, the Issue vvas vvisely given in by them. For the Indictment vvas conceiv'd in such Words, That the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verest Judges could never have found <hi>Bothwel</hi> Guilty, for it vvas laid against a Murder committed the 9<hi>th</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> vvhereas the King vvas slain the <hi>Tenth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Bothwel</hi> was acquitted of the Fact, but not of the Infamy of it. Suspicions did increase upon him, and his Punishment seemed only to be deferred; but any Pretence whatsoever, though a shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less one, seem'd good enough to the Queen, who made haste to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry him. As a Surplusage to his Absolution, there was a Chartel,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bothwel</hi> chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusers.</note> or Challenge, posted on the eminentest part of the Court, declaring, That though <hi>Bothwel</hi> was lawfully acquitted of the King's Murder, yet, to make his Innocency more appear, he was ready to decide the matter in a Duel against any Gentleman, or Person of Honour, that should dare lay it to his charge. The Morrow after, there was
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:56771:324"/>
one, which did, as manfully, post up an Answer to his Challenge, provided the place of Combate were appointed, wherein, without Danger, he might declare his Name. Though these things suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded reasonably well, yet the Queen, in that Parliament, was more rugged, than formerly; for, whereas before, she pretended Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility in her Carriage, now, she plainly discovered a Desire of Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; for what she promised at <hi>Sterlin,</hi> in Matters of Religion, she now flatly deny'd; and That was, That the Laws, establish'd under Popish Tyranny, should be abrogated in the first Parliament, and the Reformed Religion should be strengthned by new Laws. And, when besides her Promise, Two Edicts, signed with her own hand, were produced; being catch'd here, she boggled, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Commissioners of the <hi>Kirk,</hi> to attend her another Time; and, after that, she never gave them opportunity to appear before her again; and those Acts of the Estates, which were Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished before her coming into <hi>Scotland,</hi> by the consent of <hi>Francis</hi> her Husband, those, she alleg'd, did fall under the Act of Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion: That Speech seemed to all a manifest Profession of Tyranny. For, whereas the <hi>Scots</hi> had no Laws, besides Acts of Parliament, they entertained such private Thoughts in their Breasts, <hi>What kind of Life they were like to live, under a Prince, whose Will was a Law, and whose Word and Promise were not to be believed.</hi> This was done about the end of the Convention. At the same time, the Queen was very earnest to hasten her Marriage, and yet withal she de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired by any means, to procure the publick Consent, that she might seem to act nothing, but by the Suffrage of the Nobles. And <hi>Bothwel</hi> too,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bothwel</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures a Sche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dule from some of the unwary Nobility, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging his Marriage with the Queen,</note> to credit the Marriage with the Pretence of publick Authority, devised this Stratagem: He invited all the Nobility of the highest Rank, which were then in Town (as there were many) to Supper, and when they were jocund and merry, he desired them to shew that Respect to him for the future, which they had always done heretofore. At present, he only desired, that, whereas he was a Suiter to the Queen, they would subscribe to a Schedule, which he had made, about that matter, and that would be a Means to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure him Favour with the Queen, and Honour with all the People. They were all amazed at so sudden and unexpected a Proposal, and could not dissemble their Sorrow, neither yet durst they refuse or deny him; Whereupon, a few, that knew the Queen's Mind, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan first, and the rest, not foreseeing, that there were so great a number of Flatterers present, suspected one another, and at last, all subscribed. The Day after, when they recollected what they had done, some of them as ingenuously profess'd, they would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have given their consent, unless they had thought the thing had been acceptable to the Queen;<note place="margin">Which some of them after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards retract.</note> for, besides that it carried no great shew of Honesty, and was prejudicial to the Publick too; so, there was danger, if any Discord should arise (as it happen'd between her and her former Husband) between her and <hi>Bothwel,</hi> also; and he were rejected, it might be laid in their Dishes, That they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed the Queen to a dishonorable Marriage; and therefore, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had gone too far, they resolved to try her Mind, and to procure a Writing under her hand, to this Sense; That she did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:56771:324"/>
of what they had done, in reference to her Marriage. This Scrole was easily obtained, and, by the consent of them all, given to the Earl of <hi>Argyle</hi> to keep. The next day, all the Bishops in Town were called to Court, that they also might subscribe. This care being over, there succeeded another, which was, How the Queen should get her Son into her Power, for <hi>Bothwel</hi> did not think it safe for him, to have a young Child brought up, which, in time, might revenge his Father's Murder; neither was he willing, That any other should come between his Children and the Crown. Whereupon the Queen, who could now deny him nothing, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook the Task her self, to bring the Child to <hi>Edinburgh</hi>; she had also another Pretence to visit <hi>Sterlin,</hi> of which I shall speak anon; when she came thither, the Earl of <hi>Marr</hi> suspected, what was a brewing, and therefore shewed her the Prince; but would not let him be in her Power: The Queen, seeing her Fraud detected, and not able to cope with him by Force, pretended another cause for her Journy, and prepared to return; In her Journy, either by reason of her overmuch Toil; or, for Anger, that her Designs, which the Authors thought craftily laid, were unsuccessful, she was taken with a sudden Illness, and was forced to retire into a poor House about four Miles from <hi>Sterlin,</hi>

               </note> The common People put this Interpretation on the matter; That she could not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conceal her Familiarity with <hi>Bothwel,</hi> nor yet could well want It; nor could she openly injoy it, as she desired, without the loss of her Reputation: It was too tedious to expect his Divorce from his former Wife; and she was willing to consult her Honour, which, she pretended, to have a great regard to, yet she would provide for her Lust, too; of which she was very impatient, and therefore the device was thought to be very pretty, That <hi>Bothwel</hi> should redeem the Queen's Infamy, with his own great Crime; the Punishment whereof yet he did not at all fear. But there was a deeper reach in the Project, as was after understood. For, whereas the People did every where point at, and curse, the King's Murderers: They, to provide for their own Security, by the Persuasion, as 'tis thought, of <hi>Iohn Lesly,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Ross,</hi> devised this Attempt upon the Queen. 'Tis the manner in <hi>Scotland,</hi> when the King grants a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for Offences, he, that sues it out, expresseth his great Offence by Name, and the rest of his Crimes are added, in general Words; accordingly, the King's Murderers determined to ask Pardon for this Surprize of the Queen by Name, and then to add in their Pardons, by way of Overplus, <hi>All other wicked Facts</hi>: In which clause, they persuaded themselves, That the King's Murder would be included, because, 'twas not safe for them to name themselves the Authors of it, in the Pardon; nor, was it creditable for the Queen so to grant it; neither could it well be added in the Grant of Pardon, as an
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:56771:325"/>
Appendix to a lesser Crime: Another Offence, less invidious, but liable to the same Punishment, was to be devised, under the Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow whereof the Kings Murder might be disguised and pardoned, and no other did occur to them, but this simulated force put upon the Queen, whereby her Pleasure might be satisfied, and <hi>Bothwel</hi>'s Security provided for, too; and therefore he, accompanied vvith 600 Horse, vvaited her Coming at <hi>Almon</hi> Bridg, and took her, by her ovvn consent,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bothwel</hi> actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly surprizes the Queen;</note> to <hi>Dunbar</hi>: There they had free Converse one vvith another, and a Divorce vvas made betvvixt <hi>Bothwel</hi> and his former Wife, and that in Two Courts: First, she vvas cited before Judges publickly appointed to decide such kind of Controversies; and next, before the Officials, or Bishop's Courts, though they vvere forbid, by a publick Statute, to exercise any part of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracy; or, to meddle vvith any publick Business; Madam <hi>Gordon, Bothwel</hi>'s Wife, vvas compelled to commence a Suit of Divorce, in a double Court,<note place="margin">And is divorc'd from his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Wife, for Adultery.</note> before the Queen's Judges; she accuses him of Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, vvhich vvas the only just cause of a Divorce amongst them; and before the Papal Judges, vvho, though forbidden by the Lavv, yet vvere impovvered by the Arch-bishop of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the Controversy: She alleged against him, that, before their Marriage, he had had too much unlavvful, or incestuous, Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity vvith her Kinsvvoman: The Witnesses and Judges made no Delay in the Case. The Suit vvas commenc'd, prosecuted, adjudg'd, and ended, in ten Days.</p>
            <p>On these Emergencies, a great many of the honest Nobles met at <hi>Sterlin,</hi> and sent to the Queen; desiring to knovv of her, Whether she vvere kept, where she vvas, vvillingly or against her Will? if this later, they would levy an Army for her Deliverance. She re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Message, not without smiling, and answered them, That, 'twas true, she was brought thither against her Will, but was so kindly treated since, that she had little cause to complain of the former Injury. Thus was the Messenger eluded; but, though they made haste to take off the Reflection of the force by a lawful Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, there were two <hi>Remora's</hi> yet in the way; One was, That if she married, whilst a Prisoner, the Marriage might not be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed good, and so easily dissolved. The Other, How to have the usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Ceremonies observed, That the Bans should be publish'd, three Lord's Days in the publick Congregations,
<q>Of a Marriage intended between <hi>Iames Hepburn,</hi> and <hi>Mary Stuart</hi>; so that, if any one knew a lawful Impediment, why they might not be joined together in Matrimony, they should declare it, that so it might be decided by the Church.</q>
To accomplish this, <hi>Bothwel</hi> gathers his Friends and Dependents together, resolving to bring back the Queen to <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> that so, under a vain shew of her Liberty, he might deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine of their Marriage, at his Pleasure. His Companions were all arm'd, and, as they were on their Journy, a fear seiz'd on some of them, lest, one time or other, it might turn to their Prejudice, to hold the Queen as yet a Prisoner; and if there were no other ground for it, yet this was enough, That they accompanied her in an arm'd Posture, when things were otherwise in Peace and Quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: Upon this Scruple, they threw away their Arms, and so, in a
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:56771:325"/>
seeming more peaceable Posture, they brought her to the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> which was then in <hi>Bothwel</hi>'s Power.</p>
            <p>The next Day, they accompanied her into the City, and into the Courts of Justice, where she affirm'd before the Judges, that she was wholly free, and under no Restraint at all.<note place="margin">Ecclesiasticks backward to publish the <hi>Bans,</hi> or to ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate the Marriage, be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tween the Queen and <hi>Bothwel:</hi>

And the King of <hi>France,</hi> and Queen of <hi>England,</hi> did, by their Embassadors, declare against the Turpitude of the thing: Though that was troublesom to her, yet the silent Sadness of the People did so much the more increase the fierce Disposition of the Queen, as things seen do pierce deeper, than things only heard. As they both went through the City,<note place="margin">â˜œ</note> none saluted them with wonted Acclamations, only one said, and that but once, <hi>God Save the Queen</hi>; whereupon, another Woman near her, spoke aloud,<note place="margin">Even the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar dislike the Queen's Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</note> once or twice, so that the Standers-by might hear her, <hi>Let every one have what his Desert is:</hi> That Matter mightily inflam'd her Mind a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Edinburghers,</hi> with whom she was angry before. When she saw, how disaffected People were to her, both at Home and Abroad, she took Advice with her Cabal, How she might establish her Power, and quell any Insurrection for the future.

This Excuse is built, as upon a Foundation, on the true Narration of his Life, and especially of the good Offices, which the Duke of the <hi>Orcades</hi> hath done me, even to that very Day, wherein I thought good to make him my Husband: You shall begin the Declaration of that Story, as the Truth is, taking your Rise from his very Youth. Assoon as ever he came to be of Age, after the Death of his Father, one of the prime Noblemen of the Kingdom, he wholly addicted himself to the Service of the Princes of this Land, being otherwise of a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry noble Family, both by reason of its Antiquity, and also the high Offices it held in the Kingdom, as by Hereditary Right: At that time, he principally addicted himself to the Service of my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who then held the Scepter, and was so constant an Adherent to her, that though, in a very short time, a great many of the Nobility, and many Towns also, had revolted from her, on the account of Religion, yet he never faultred in his Loyalty; neither could he be induc'd, by any Proffers, Promises, or Threats, nor by any Loss of his particular Estate, to make a Defection, in the least, from her Authority; nay, rather than neglect her Service, he suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd his House, the Mansion-House of the Family, and all his Goods, which were many and precious, to be plundred, and his Estate made a Prey to his Enemies: At last, being destitute of my Aid, and all other besides, an <hi>English</hi> Army was brought in by domestick Enemies, into the very Bowels of the Kingdom, on purpose to inforce my Husband (then Earl of <hi>Bothwel</hi>) to leave his Estate and Country, and to retire to <hi>France</hi>; where he obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved me with all Respect, till my Return to <hi>Scotland.</hi> Neither must his Military Exploits against the <hi>English</hi> be forgotten, a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before my Return, wherein he gave such Proofs of his manly Valour, and great Prudence too, that he was thought worthy, though a young Man, to command his Superiours in Age; so that he was chosen chief General of the Army of his Country-men, and my Lieutenant, which Office he discharged so well, That, by many valiant Performances, he left a noble Memorial of his Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, both amongst his Enemies, and also his own Country-men. After my Return, he imployed all his Endeavours for the Enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my Authority; he spar'd no Danger in subduing the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels upon the Borders of <hi>England</hi>; where having reduc'd things to great Tranquillity, he resolv'd to do the same in other Parts of the Kingdom: But, as Envy is always the Companion of Virtue, the <hi>Scots</hi> still desiring Innovations, and some of them, willing to lessen my Favour towards him, did so ill interpret his good Services, that they caused me to commit him to Prison; which I did, partly to gratify some, who envied the Growth of his increasing Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; and partly to allay the seditious Commotions, which were then ready to break out, to the Destruction of the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:56771:326"/>
He made his Escape out of Prison, and, that he might yield to the Power of his Emulators, he retir'd into <hi>France,</hi> and there he abode almost Two years; in which time, the Authors of the former Seditions, forgetting my Lenity towards them, and their Duty towards me, took up Arms, and led an Army against me. Thereupon, I commanded him to return, I restor'd him to his Honour and Estate, and made him General over all my Forces, by whose Conduct my Authority was again so restor'd, that all the Rebels were quickly inforc'd to seek Shelter in <hi>England,</hi> until a great part of them, upon their own Request, were again receiv'd by me into Favour. How perfidiously I was treated by those Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iles which returned, and by those, whom I had oblig'd with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Courtesies, than they deserved, my Uncle is not ignorant of, and therefore I need say little of it; yet, I must not pretermit in silence, with how great diligence he freed me from the Hands of Those, who held me Prisoner; and how speedily, by his singular Conduct, I escap'd out of Prison; and, the whole Faction of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirators being dissipated, I recovered my former Authority. On this Head, I must acknowledg, that his Services were so grateful, that I could never suffer them to slip out of my Memory: These things are Great in themselves, yet he hath made such an Accession to them, by his anxious Sedulity and Diligence, that I could never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect greater Observance or Faithfulness in any Man, than I have found in him, even until after the Decease of my late Husband: Since that time, as his Thoughts seemed to aim higher, so his Actions were a little more insolent; and though the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was come to that pass, that I must take all things in the best part, yet I was much offended with his Arrogance, in thinking I had ability to requite his Services no otherwise, than by giving up my self to him, as their Guerdon and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; besides, I did dislike his secret Designs against, and, at length, his open Contempt of Me, and the Force used to get me into his Power, lest otherwise he might be frustrated in his Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. In the mean time, the whole Course of his Life was so or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, that it may be an Example, how Men, that undertake great Designs, can craftily conceal their Purposes, till they obtain their Ends. For, I thought, that his Sedulity and Diligence, in his speedy Obedience to all my Commands, proceeded from no other Fountain, than his Loyal Desire to please me; neither did I ever imagine, that he had any higher Wish or Design; neither did I think, those more gracious Countenances, which I sometimes shew towards my Nobles, to ingage them more readily to obey my Commands, would have exalted his Mind, to promise to himself the Hope of a more extraordinary Courtesy from me; yet he, turning even fortuitous things to his own Advantage, maintained Designs unknown to me; and, by his wonted Observance, nourish'd his ancient Love; as also by currying Favour with the Nobility, he was privily ambitious of a new Favour, and he was so sedulous therein, that though I knew nothing of it, yet when the Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Estates was celebrated, he obtain'd a <hi>Chart</hi> from all the Nobility, subscrib'd with their Hands, to make it more Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:56771:327"/>
wherein they declared their Assent to the Marriage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Me and Him, and promis'd to expose their Lives and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes to bring it to pass, and to be Enemies to all those that should oppose it. And more easily to obtain the Assent of the Nobles, he persuaded each of them, that all these things were manag'd by my Consent. This Writing being once obtain'd, next, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, he most humbly sought for my Consent; but my Answer not suiting with his Desire, he began to propound such things to himself, which are wont to occur in such great Undertakings, as, the outward Demonstrations of my Good Will, the Ways by which my Friends, or his Enemies, might hinder his Design; and, lest any of those, who had subscrib'd, should withdraw their Assent, and many other things, which were cast in, or came free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to hinder his Purpose. At length, he determined with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, to pursue the Favour of his present Fortune, and to cast the whole Business, with his Life and Hope, on the hazard of one Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; so that, being resolved to execute his Design to purpose, after he had waited 4 days, as I was returning from visiting my Dear Son, he watch'd a convenient Place and Time, and, on the way, sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed me, with a strong Party of Men, and carried me speedily to <hi>Dunbar.</hi> How I took the Fact, especially from him, of whom, amongst all my Subjects, I expected no such thing, every one may easily judg. There I upbraided him with my Favours to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, and how honourably I had always spoken before of his Manners and Behaviour, and how ungratefully he had carried it towards me: Other things I spake, to free my self out of his Hands; his Usage, indeed, was somewhat course, but his Words were fair and smooth, as, that he would use me with all Honour and Observance, and would do his utmost not to offend me in any thing; but for carrying me against my Will, into one of my own Castles, for so bold an Attempt, he crav'd my Pardon, alleging, he was forc'd, by the Power of Love, so to do, forgetting the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and Allegiance, which, as a Subject, he ow'd to me. He said further, That he was compell'd to go thither for fear of his Life. Then he began to rehearse to me the whole Course of his Life, and lamented his Misfortune, that those, whom he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver offended, were his bitter Enemies, and whose Malice had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised all unjust ways to do him a Mischief; what envious Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were made upon him, for the King's Death, and how unable he was to bear up against the hidden Conspiracy of those of his Enemies, whom he knew not, because they pretended Good-will towards him both in Speech and Behaviour; neither was he able to prevent those Treacheries, which he did know. Their Malice against him was so great, that, at no Time or Place, he could live a quiet Life, unless he was assur'd of my unchangeable Favour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him: And to assure that, he knew but one way, and that was, That I would vouchsafe to make him my Husband; withal, he solemnly swore, that he did not seek Preheminence therein, or the Top and Height of Dignity, but this <hi>one</hi> Thing, That he might be able to serve and obey me, as hitherto he had done, all the Days of his Life. This his Oration, he deck'd with that Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:56771:327"/>
as his Cause required. But when he saw, I could not be wrought upon, neither by Prayers nor Promises, at length, he shewed me the Transactions of the Nobility, and all the Estates, and what they had promised under their Hands. This being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced before me on a sudden, and beyond my Expectation, I leave it to the King, Queen, my Uncle, and the rest of my Friends, Whether it might not administer a just Cause of Amazement to me: Whereupon, when I saw my self in another Man's Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, separate from those, who were wont to give me Counsel; yea, when I saw those Persons, on whose Faithfulness and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, I had cast my self, whose Power must confirm my Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that otherwise would be little or none at all; I say, when I saw such Men to have devoted themselves to gratify his Will and Desire, and I left alone, as his Prey; I ponder'd many things in my Mind, but could not find a Way how to extricate my self; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did he give me any long time to consider of the matter, but did press his Purpose with great eagerness: At last, when I saw I had no hope to escape, and that there was not a Man in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, that would stir for my Deliverance, for I easily perceived by the Roll he shewed me, and by the great Silence of the Time, that All were drawn to his Party: When my Anger was a little abated, I applied my Mind to consider his Request; Then I began to set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my Eyes his Services in former Times, and the great Hopes I had, he would constantly persist in the same for the future; And again, how hardly my Subjects would endure a foreign Prince, who was unacquainted with their Laws, That they would not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer me to be a Widow, long; That a People, prone to Tumults, could not be kept within the Bounds of their Duty, unless my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority was upheld and exercis'd by a Man, who was able to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo the Toil of governing the Commonwealth, and so to bridle the Insolence of the Rebellious; that my Strength was weakned with the Weight of those things, ever since I came into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and almost broke to nothing; insomuch, that I could no longer bear the daily Tumults and Rebellions, that arose. Furthermore, by reason of these Seditions, I was forc'd to create Four, or more, Lieutenants, in divers Parts of the Kingdom; most of which, under colour of the Authority granted by me, caus'd my Subjects to take Arms against me. For these Reasons, when I saw, That, if I would support my Imperial State, I must incline my Heart to Marriage; and, that my Subjects would not bear a foreign King; And, that amongst my Subjects, there was none for Splendor of Family, for Prudence and Valour, and other Endowments of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Mind, could exceed, or so much as bear a comparison with, him, whom I have now married; I prevail'd with my self to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the universal Decree of my Estates, of which I spake be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. After my Constancy was batter'd by these Reasons, partly by Force, partly by Flattery, he obtain'd a Promise from me to marry him; which having done, I could not obtain from him, (who fear'd, lest my Mind should change,) to put off the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of it, that so I might have had time to communicate the Matter to the King and Queen of <hi>France,</hi> and to my other Friends
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:56771:328"/>
beyond Sea; but, as he audaciously began, so, that he might ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at the top of his Desires, he never gave over to solicite me by Arguments and earnest Entreaties, until at last he compell'd Me, not without Force, to put an end to the Matter begun, and that at such a Time and Way, as seem'd to him most convenient to his Purpose. And upon this head, I cannot dissemble, but must needs say, that I was treated by him otherwise, than I would, or than I had deserv'd of him; for he was more solicitous to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy them, by whose Consent, tho extorted from them at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, he judges himself to have accomplish'd his Desires, (he having deceiv'd Them, as well as my self) than to gratify Me, by considering, what was fit and creditable for me to do, who had been always brought up in the Rites and Institutions of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, from which, he, nor no Man living, shall ever divert Me. In this Point, I confess, tho I acknowledg my Error, yet, I much desire, that the King, the Queen, his Mother, my Uncle, nor o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Friends of mine, would not expostulate with him, or rub up old Sores. For now Matters being so compleated, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be undone, I take all things in the best part; and, as he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed my Husband, I resolve now to look upon him, as one that hereafter I will Love and Reverence; and they who profess them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves my Friends, must needs carry the same Respects to him, since now we are join'd in the indissoluble Bond of Matrimony. Tho, in some things, he hath carried himself something neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently, and almost rashly, yet I impute it to his immoderate Love towards Me, and do therefore intreat the King, Queen, my Uncle, and other Friends, to respect him as much, as if all had been manag'd by their Advice, even to this very Day; and, on the other side, We promise, in his behalf, that he will gratify them in all things, which they shall desire.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This was the Remedy provided against the bad Reports of the World abroad; but against Domestick Tumults they provided, after they had fixed those, by Gifts at present, and Promises for the future, who were either Perpetrators or Partizans in the King's Murder,<note place="margin">The Queen frames an As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sociation for the Nobility to subscribe,</note> To make a Combination of the greater part of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility; if that were done, they might undervalue the rest; or, if they remain'd obstinate, cut them off. Whereupon, they as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled many of the Nobility, and propounded to them the Heads of the Capitulations, they were to swear: The sum was, That they should maintain the Queen and <hi>Bothwel,</hi> and all their Actings; and on the other side, They were to Favour and Countenance the Concerns of Those of the Confederates, there present. A great many were persuaded before, and so subscribed; the rest, perceiving it was bad to conspire, and as dangerous to refuse, they subscribed, too. <hi>Murray</hi> was sent for, that his Authority (which was great, for his Virtue) might give some Countenance to the thing. As he was on his Journy, he was advis'd by his Friends, to consult his own Safety, and not to lie in <hi>Seton</hi> House, where the Queen and the chief Conspirators were, but rather to lodge in some Friends House in a Village hard by.<note place="margin">Which the Earl of <hi>Murray</hi> refus'd to do,</note> He answer'd, That was not in his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but, come what would, he would never assent to any flagiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:56771:328"/>
Act, the rest he left to God. To the Courtiers, who were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the Queen, to debate with him about subscribing the League,
<q>He answer'd, That he could not justly nor honestly make this League with the Queen, (whom in all things, else twas his Duty to obey); That he was reconcil'd to <hi>Bothwel,</hi> by the Queens Mediation: Whatever he had then promis'd, he would observe to a tittle; neither was it Equitable, or Good for the Commonwealth, that he should make another League or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination with him, or any other Man.</q>
The Queen accosted him more kindly than ordinary for some Days, and promis'd to tell him her Mind in all things, yet she could not speak out for Shame, and therefore try'd his Mind by her Friends; They also, perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Constancy in that which was Right, openly confest, what 'twas they desir'd: And seeing they did no good by their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand Ways, at length <hi>Bothwel</hi> set upon him, and after much Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, told him, That he did that Fact not willingly, nor for himself alone. His Countenance frown'd at that Word; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Bothwel,</hi> having sometimes by serious Discourse, sometimes by terms near to railing, driven the nail, as far as it would go, at last endeavour'd to cast in Seeds of Discord, and to urge him to a Quarrel. He, on the contrary, answer'd moderately, gave no just occasion for a Combate, yet kept himself upright, and did not depart, in the least, from his Resolution. When <hi>Murray</hi> was versant in these straits for some Days, he ask'd leave of the Queen, that, seeing there was no great need of him at Court, he might have Liberty to retire to St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> or into <hi>Murray</hi>; for he was willing to go out of the Way, That he might not be suspected to be the Author of the Tumults, which, he foresaw, would arise. When he could not obtain that, nor yet remain at Court without great and apparent Danger, He, at last, got leave to travel,<note place="margin">And therefore departs the Land.</note> but upon Condition, not to stay in <hi>England,</hi> but to pass either through <hi>Flanders</hi> into <hi>Germany,</hi> or whither else he pleas'd. To go to <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> was all one as to cast himself into Evident Danger, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, with much adoe, he obtain'd leave to pass thrÃ´ <hi>England</hi> into <hi>France,</hi> and from thence, whither he pleas'd himself. The Queen, being thus freed of a Free-hearted and popular Person, endeavours to remove the other Obstacles to her Tyranny, and Those were such, as would not willingly subscribe to her Wickedness; or, were not like easily to acquiesce in her Designs. But she had a special hatred against those, who, perceiving her to be no better affected towards her Son, than towards her former Husband, made an Association at <hi>Sterlin,</hi> for no wicked Design,<note place="margin">A contrary As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sociation en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into by several of the Nobility, to preserve the young King.</note> but only to Defend the young Prince, which his Mother desir'd to have under the Power of his Father-in-Law. As for him, every Body knew, that he would make away with the Child, as soon as ever he had Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity so to do, that so he might not Live to be a Revenger of his Fathers death, nor to prevent his Children from the Crown. The chief of that Combination, were, the Earls of <hi>Argyle, Morton, Marr, Athol</hi> and <hi>Glencarn</hi>; besides others of the same Order, but inferior, and next in Degree, as <hi>Patrick Linsey,</hi> and <hi>Robert Boyd,</hi> with their Friends and Partners, who had adjoin'd themselves to
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:56771:329"/>
them. But <hi>Argyle,</hi> with the same Levity, that he came in to them, in a Day or Two, discover'd their Designs to the Queen; and <hi>Boyd,</hi> was, by large Promises, wrought over to the contrary Party. Next to these, she suspected the Families of the <hi>Humes,</hi> the <hi>Carrs,</hi> and the <hi>Scots,</hi> living by the Borders of <hi>England,</hi> whose Power she sought, by all means, to lessen, and for that there seem'd a just occasion to be offer'd. For, when <hi>Bothwel</hi> was preparing an Expedition into <hi>Liddisdale,</hi> to make amends for the disgrace, he had receiv'd there the Autumn before; and also, to get some Credit by his Arms, to take off the envy of the King's Death, all the chief of the Families in <hi>Teviotdale</hi> were commanded by the Queen, to come in to the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> that there, for some short time, they might be secure, as in free Custody; upon pretence, that they might not be led into an Expedition, which did not seem likely to be successfully accomplish'd, against their Wills; and they also, if at Liberty, might disturb the design, out of Envy; and, in their Absence, she might inure the Clans to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of others; and so, by degrees, wear off the Love of their old Patrons and Masters. But they, imagining, that there was some deeper Project hid under that Command, went home in the Night, all except <hi>Andrew Carr,</hi> who was commonly thought not ignorant of the Parricide, and <hi>Walter Carr</hi> of <hi>Sesford,</hi> a Man, that, by reason of his Innocent Life, suspected nothing. <hi>Hume,</hi> being often summon'd by <hi>Bothwel</hi> to come to Court, refus'd so to do; as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the King's thoughts towards him, yet notwithstanding the design for the Expedition proceeds, and the Queen staid at <hi>Borth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi> Castle, about 8 Miles from <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> In the mean time, they, who had united to defend the King, being not ignorant of <hi>Bothwels</hi> intention towards him, thought it necessary to proceed to Action, not only for their own Security, but also, that, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding Justice upon the Author of the King's Murder, they might acquit the <hi>Scotish</hi> Name from the Infamy, under which it lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst foreign Nations. And therefore, supposing the common People would follow their Motions, they privately levy'd about 2000 Horse: So that the Queen knew nothing of what was Acted, till <hi>Hume</hi> came to <hi>Borthwick</hi> Castle, vvith part of the Army, and besieg'd Her, and <hi>Bothwel,</hi> together. But the other Part of the Conspirators, not coming in at the time appointed, and he having not force enough, to stop all Passages; and was not so active nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as he might have been, because the rest had neglected their Parts;<note place="margin">The Queen es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capes from the associated No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, in Mans Apparel.</note> First, <hi>Bothwel,</hi> made his escape, and after him, the Queen in Mans apparel, and went directly to <hi>Dunbar. Athol</hi> was the occasion, why his Associates came not in seasonably enough; For he, either amaz'd at the Greatness of the Undertaking; or, detain'd by his own sluggish Temper, kept the rest at <hi>Sterlin,</hi> until the Opportunity of the Service vvas lost; yet, that they might seem to have done something, a great part of them were sent to besiege <hi>Edinburgh. Iames Balfure</hi> vvas Governor of the Castle there, put in by <hi>Bothwel,</hi> as being a Partner in the Parricide, and Author of, or else Privy to, all his Designs; but when he saw he had no Pay for his Service, and vvas not so vvell respected by the Tyrants as he
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:56771:329"/>
expected, for they had endeavour'd to take away the Command from him, he drove out Those of the contrary Faction, and brought the Castle under his sole Power; he then promis'd the publick Vindicators of the Parricide, That he would do them no hurt, and was creating of Conditions, how to deliver it up. There were then in the Town, the Principal of the Queen's Faction, <hi>Iohn Hamilton,</hi> the Arch-bishop of St. <hi>Andrews; George Gordon,</hi> Earl of <hi>Huntly,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Lesly,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Ross:</hi> They understanding, that their Enemies were receiv'd into the Town, flew to the Town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house, and there offer'd themselves Captains to the Multitude, to drive them out; but very few coming in to them, they were driven back to the Castle; they were received into it by <hi>Balfure,</hi> and a few days after were sent away safe, a by-way: For <hi>Balfure,</hi> having not yet fully agreed with the other Side, would not then cut off all his Hopes of Pardon from those of his Party: The Town easily came into the Combination, for it had been burden'd a little before with new Taxes from the Queen; and, in the publick Necessity, they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected no Moderation from her Party, and were unanimously offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with her Tyranny; yea, as oft as they had Liberty to express their Sentiments, they cursed the Court-Wickedness with most grievous Execrations.</p>
            <p>Matters being thus slowly carried by the Faction of the Nobles at <hi>Borthwick,</hi> the Queen and <hi>Bothwel,</hi> by the neglect of the Guards, escaped by Night, and with a small Retinue came to <hi>Dunbar,</hi> where they had a well-fortify'd Castle to secure themselves in; Thereupon, there followed so great a change of things, that they, who were lately in great Despair, now, by the flocking in of those to them, who either were Partners in their Evils, or else followed the Shadow of the Royal Name, grew strong enough, as they thought, to cope with and subdue their Adversaries. On the other side, the Vindicators of Liberty were driven to great Straits; for, to their great Disappointment, there were but a few came in to so renown'd an Undertaking; the Heat of the Vulgar, as is usual, quickly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating, and a great part of the Nobility being very averse, or at least standing aloof off, expecting the Issue of the others Danger; besides, though they were superior in Number, yet they wanted Artillery to take in Castles: Seeing then no Issue of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels at present, Necessity in a manner compelling them, they thought to return without effecting any thing: But the Queen de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided their Doubts, for she,<note place="margin">And arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them.</note> taking Courage from the Numbers she had, resolv'd with them to march for <hi>Leith,</hi> to try her Fortune neer at hand, imagining also, That at her Coming, greater Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course would have been made to her; and That her Boldness would strike Terror into her Enemies; Besides, the Success of former times had so elated her Spirit, That she thought now hardly any Man would stand to look her in the Face. This her Confidence was much heighten'd by her Flatterers, and especially by <hi>Edmond Hayes,</hi> a Lawyer; he told her, That all things were pervious to her Valour, That her Enemies wanted Force, and were at their Wits end, and, at the very Noise of her Coming, would be packing away: Whereas, indeed, the matter was far otherwise, and in the
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:56771:330"/>
present Circumstances, nothing had been better for her, than De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay; for, if she had kept her self in the Castle of <hi>Dunbar,</hi> but three Days longer, the Vindicators of Liberty, being destitute of all Preparation for War, as having attempted their Liberty in vain, must have been forc'd to depart every one to his own House. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, she march'd from <hi>Dunbar,</hi> being excited by bad Counsel, and by vain hopes; yet she march'd slowly, because she distributed Arms to the Country-men, that she gathered up by the way. At length a little before Night, they came to <hi>Seton,</hi> and because they could not be quarter'd there, they divided their Number into two Neighbouring Villages, both called <hi>Preston</hi>: From thence a fearful Alarm was brought to <hi>Edinburgh</hi> before Midnight, and presently the Word was given, <hi>To your Arms</hi>; They rose out of their Beds, and made all the haste they could into the Fields adjoining, and there having gathered a good Body together by Sun-rising, they set them in Battel-array; thence they march'd to <hi>Musselburgh,</hi> to pass the River <hi>Esk,</hi> before the Bridg and Ford were possess'd by the Enemy, (that Village is but two Miles from <hi>Preston</hi>) but meeting no body, and perceiving no Noise at all, they placed Guards and Sentinels, and went to refresh themselves with Food. In the mean time, the Scouts which were sent for Espial, seeing a few Horse-Men, drove them into the Village, but did not dare to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them further, for fear of an Ambush; so that, they brought back no certain News of the Army, only that the Enemy was a marching: Whereupon the Vindicators of Liberty, marching out of <hi>Musselburgh,</hi> saw the Enemy standing in Battel-array, upon the brow of an Hill over against them, and that they kept their Ground. The Hill being so steep, that they could not come at them, without Prejudice, they drew a little to the right, both to have the Sun on their Backs, as also to gain an easier Ascent, and to fight up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a more advantagious Ground; that Design of theirs deceived the Queen, for she thought, they had fled, and were marching to <hi>Dalkeith,</hi> a Neighbour-Town of the Earl of <hi>Morton</hi>'s; she was fully persuaded, that the Terror of her Royal Name was so great, that they durst not stand;<note place="margin">A State Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im, irrefraga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly true.</note> but she quickly found, That <hi>Authority, as 'tis gotten by good Arts, so may be quickly lost by bad; and that Majesty destitute of Virtue, is soon brought to nothing.</hi> In their March, the <hi>Dalkeithians</hi> brought them forth all manner of Provisions in Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance. When they had refresh'd themselves, and quench'd their Thirst, which much annoy'd them before, as soon as ever they got a convenient place, they divided their Army into two Bodies, <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> commanded the first, assisted by <hi>Alexander Hume</hi> and his Vassals: The second was led on by the Earls of <hi>Glencarn,</hi>

               <hi>Marr,</hi> and <hi>Athol</hi>; when they were thus ready to charge, <hi>Crock</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor came to them,<note place="margin">Monsieur <hi>Crock,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sador mediates for a Peace.</note> he prefaced to them, by an Interpreter, how he had always studied the Good and Tranquillity of the <hi>Scots,</hi> and that he was now of the same Mind, and therefore he earnestly desired, if possible, that the Controversy might be decided to the Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of both Parties, without Force or Bloodshed, wherein he offered his Service, alleging, That the Queen also was not averse from Peace; and, to incline them to believe it, he told them, she

would give a present Pardon, and Oblivion of what was done, and she faithfully promised, That they should all be indemnified, for taking up Arms against the Supream Magistrate. When Mr. <hi>Crock</hi>'s Interpreter had thus spoken, <hi>Morton</hi> answered,
<q>They had not took up Arms against the Queen, but against the Murderer of the late King, whom, if she would deliver up to Punishment, or sever her self from him, then she should understand, They and their Fellow-Subjects desired nothing more, than to persist in their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to Her: Otherwise, no Agreement could be made.</q>
               <hi>Glencarn</hi> added,

               <hi>Bothwel</hi> was bid to shift for himself, (for that was it which she aim'd at, by pretending a Conference) who made such fearful haste to <hi>Dunbar,</hi> that he commanded two Horse-Men, that accompanied him, to return back again. Such a Load of Guilt lay upon his Mind, that he could hardly trust his own Friends. The Queen, when she thought he was out of Danger, articled with <hi>Kircade,</hi> that the rest of her Army should pass quietly home, and so she came with him to the Nobles, cloth'd only with a Tunicle, and that a mean and thread-bare one too, reaching but a little below her Knees: Of the Van of the Army, she was receiv'd, not without Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of their former Reverence; but when she desir'd, that they would dismiss her to meet the <hi>Hamiltons,</hi> who were said to be coming on, promising to return again, and commanded <hi>Morton</hi> to undertake for her, (for she hoped, by fair Promises, to do what she would) when she could not obtain it, she brake forth into Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terness of Language, and upbraided the Commanders with what she had done for them; they also heard her with Silence: But when she came to the second Body, there was an unanimous Cry from them all; <hi>Burn the Whore, burn the Parricide.</hi> King <hi>Henry</hi> was painted in one of the Banners, dead, and his little Son by him, craving Vengeance of God for the Murder; that Banner two Souldiers stretch'd out betwixt two Pikes, and set before her Eyes, whither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever she went; at this Sight she swooned; and could scarce be kept upon her Horse; but, recovering her self, she remitted nothing of her former Fierceness, uttering Threats and Reproaches, shed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Tears, and manifesting other Appendexes to Women's Griefs. In her March, she made what Delay she could, expecting, if any Aid might come from elsewhere; but one of the Company cry'd out, There was no reason she should expect the <hi>Hamiltons,</hi> for there was not an arm'd Man, in many Miles of the place: At last a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before Night, she entred <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> her Face being covered with Dust and Tears, as if Dirt had been cast upon it, all the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple running out to see the Spectacle, she past through a great part of the City in great Silence, the Multitude leaving her so narrow a Passage, that scarce one could go a breast; when she was going up to her Lodging, one Woman of the Company prayed for her; but she turning to the People, told them, besides other threatning Words, That she would burn the City, and quench the Fire with the Blood of the perfidious Citizens. When she shewed her self weeping out of the Window, and a great Concourse of People was made, amongst whom, some did commiserate her sudden change of Fortune: The former Banner was held out to her, whereupon she shut the Window, and flung in. When she had staid there two days, she was sent Prisoner, by the Order of the Nobles, to a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle scituated in <hi>Lough-Levin</hi>; for <hi>Edinburgh</hi>-Castle was yet held

by <hi>Balfure,</hi> who, though he favour'd the Vindicators, yet he had not made any Conditions for the Surrender of the Castle.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the Bishop of <hi>Dunblane,</hi>

The very same day, there came 2 Letters to the King and his Mother, one from <hi>Crock,</hi> his Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, another from <hi>Ninian Cockerburn,</hi> a <hi>Scot,</hi> who had serv'd, as Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Horse, some years in <hi>France</hi>; both of them discover'd the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Posture of Affairs in <hi>Scotland.</hi> The <hi>Scots</hi> Embassador, being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the King's Presence, made a long &amp; accurate Speech, partly to excuse the Queen's Marriage, without the Advice of her Friends; partly, to commend <hi>Bothwel</hi> to the Skies, beyond all Right and Reason. The Queen of <hi>France</hi> interrupted the vain Man, and shew'd him the Letters she had receiv'd from <hi>Scotland</hi>; how that the Queen was a Prisoner, and <hi>Bothwel</hi> was fled; whereupon, he was astonish'd at the sudden ill News, and held his Peace: They who were present, did partly jeer, and partly smile at, this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look'd-for Accident; there were none of them all, but thought, she suffer'd deservedly.</p>
            <p>About the same time,<note place="margin">Wondrous Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the King's Murder, in <hi>Bothwels</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet of Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</note> 
               <hi>Bothwel</hi> sent one of his faithfullest Servants into the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> to bring him a silver Cabinet, which had been sometimes <hi>Francis</hi>'s, King of <hi>France,</hi> as appear'd by the Cyphres on the outside, wherein were Letters writ, almost all, with the Queen's own Hand, in which the King's Murder, and the things vvhich followed, vvere clearly discover'd, and 'twas vvrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in almost all of them, that, as soon as he had read them, he should burn them. But <hi>Bothwel,</hi> knowing the Queen's Inconstancy, as having had many evident Examples of it in a few Years, had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd the Letters; that so, if any Difference should arise betwixt him &amp; her, he might use them as a Testimony for himself, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by declare, That he vvas not the Author, but only a Party, in the King's Murder. <hi>Balfure</hi> deliver'd this Cabinet to <hi>Bothwel</hi>'s Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, but vvithal, he inform'd the Chiefs of the adverse Party, What he had sent, Whither, and by Whom; vvhereupon, they took him, and found, in the Letters, great and mighty Matters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd, which, though before shrewdly suspected, yet could never so clearly be made forth; but here the vvhole vvicked Plot vvas vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly exposed to vievv: <hi>Bothwel,</hi> not speeding in any of his Affairs, and being destitute of all Help or Hope to recover the Kingdom, fled, first to the <hi>Orcades,</hi> then to the <hi>Schetland</hi> Isles; and there, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing driven to great Want, he exercis'd Piracy. In the Interim, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dealt vvith, and desir'd, the Queen to separate her Cause from <hi>Bothwel</hi>'s; (for, if he was punish'd, she might easily be restor'd with the Good-Will of all her Subjects:) But the fierce Woman, bearing, as yet, the Spirit of her former Fortune, and in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="212" facs="tcp:56771:332"/>
Business, the Approbation of the Better Part, if not All, would have concurr'd with them; but it fell out far otherwise, for popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Envy, being abated, partly by space of Time, and partly by the consideration of the Uncertainty of human Affairs, was turn'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Commiseration; yea, some of the Nobility, did then no less be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail the Queen's Calamity,<note place="margin">The Queen pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied in her Distress.</note> than heretofore they had execrated her Cruelty; Both which they did, rather by Inconstancy of Mind, than by any propense Affection to either side: So that it evidently appear'd, that, in such troubled Waters, they did not seek the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Peace, but rather fish for their own private Advantage; many also desir'd Quietness, and they weighed within themselves, which Party was strongest, and so were inclin'd to side with the most Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful. Their Faction was thought to be the strongest, who, either consented to the Murder, or, when the thing was done, in obsequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness to the Queen, subscrib'd to that sceleratious Fact: The chief of them came in to <hi>Hamilton,</hi> and being very strong, would receive neither Letters,<note place="margin">The <hi>Hamiltons</hi> stir in her behalf.</note> nor Messengers, from the contrary Party, in order to a Settlement; neither did they spare to reproach them with all kind of calumniating Language; and they were so much the more inrag'd, because the greatest part of the Nobles, who respected ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Blasts of Fortune, than the Equity of the Cause, did not come in to the Vindicators; for they that were not <hi>against</hi> them, they concluded were <hi>for</hi> them. Moreover, they esteem'd it a piece of Vain-Glory, that the Vindicators should enter before them into the Metropolis of the Kingdom, and from thence send for them, who were the greater Number, and more powerful. The other Party, though they had not imperiously commanded them, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly humbly desir'd; yet, to prescinde any Shew of imputable Arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance, they prevail'd with the Ministers of the Churches, to write jointly to them all, and severally to each in particular, That, in so dangerous a time, they should not be wanting to the Publick Peace; but, setting aside private Animosities, they should consult, What was most expedient for the Publick Good. These Letters did no more Good with the contrary Faction, than Those of the Nobles before; they all making the same Excuses, as if it had been so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed purposely between them. Afterwards, the Queen's Faction met together in diverse Places, and, finding no means to accomplish their Designs, they all slipp'd off, and dispers'd several ways. In the Interim, the Vindicators of the publick Parricide dealt with the Queen, (whom they could not separate from the Concerns of the Murderers) to resign up her Government, upon pretence of Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, or any other specious Allegation, and to commit the Care of her Son, and the Administration of Publick Affairs, to which of the Nobles,<note place="margin">Governours appoinetd for the young King, by the Queen her self.</note> she pleas'd. At last, with much ado, she appointed, as Governours to the Child, <hi>Iames,</hi> Earl of <hi>Murray,</hi> if, upon his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn home, he did not refuse the Charge; <hi>Iames,</hi> Duke of <hi>Castle-herault; Matthew,</hi> Earl of <hi>Lennox; Gilespy,</hi> Earl of <hi>Argyle; Iohn,</hi> Earl of <hi>Athol; Iames,</hi> Earl of <hi>Morton; Alexander,</hi> Earl of <hi>Glen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carn</hi>; and <hi>Iohn,</hi> Earl of <hi>Marr.</hi> Moreover, they sent Proxies to see the King plac'd in his Royal Throne, and so to enter on the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, either at <hi>Sterlin,</hi> or any other Place, if they thought fit.
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:56771:332"/>
These things were acted, <hi>Iuly</hi> the 25<hi>th,</hi> in the Year of our Lord, 1567. A little before, <hi>Iames,</hi> Earl of <hi>Murray,</hi> hearing how Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters went at home, returned through <hi>France,</hi> and was pretty nobly entertain'd at Court; yet so, that <hi>Hamilton</hi> (whose Faction, the <hi>Guises</hi> knew, were more intimately affected towards them) was far better receiv'd, which was occasion'd chiefly by the <hi>Guises,</hi> who were averse to all <hi>Murray</hi>'s Designs. After he was dismiss'd, the Archbishop of <hi>Glasgow,</hi> who called himself the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador, told the Court, That <hi>Iames,</hi> though absent, yet was the Chief of the Faction; and, as in former times, all things were acted by his Influence, so now he was sent for, as an Head to the Body of them. Hereupon, some were sent after to bring him back; but he, being forewarned by his Friends, had set Sail from the Haven of <hi>Deip,</hi> where he was, before the King's Letters came, and arriving in <hi>England,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Earl of <hi>Murray</hi> returns from Travel.</note> was honourably entertain'd by all Orders of Men, and so sent home. There he was receiv'd with the high Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation and Joy of all the People, especially of the Vindicators; and they all earnestly desir'd him to undertake the Government, whilst the King, his Sister's Son, was yet a Child: for he alone was able to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage that great Trust, with the least Envy, because of his Propinquity in Blood, his known Valour in many Dangers, his great Popularity grounded on his Deserts; and moreover, the Queen desir'd it, too. He, tho knowing, what they had spoke was true, yet, desir'd a few Days of Deliberation, before he gave in his Answer. In the mean time, he writes earnestly to the Heads of the other Faction, and chiefly to <hi>Argyle,</hi> as being his Kinsman, and one, whom, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of ancient Acquaintance, he was loth to offend; he told him, in what posture things were, and what the Infant-King's Party did desire of him, and therefore he intreated him, by their Nearness of Blood, by their ancient Friendship, and by the common Safety of their Country, that he would give him opportunity to speak with him, that so, by his Assistance, himself and their Country might be deliver'd out of the present Difficulties. He also wrote to the rest, according to every ones Place and Interest; and, in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, he desir'd of them all, that, seeing Matters were in such Confusion, there was no likelihood of a Settlement, without a chief Magistrate; That they should all agree, to meet together, as soon as might be, in a Place they should judg most convenient, and so, by common Consent, to settle Matters. At length, being not able to obtain a Meeting from the One Faction, nor any longer delay of a Convention from the Other, with the unanimous Consent of all, there present, he was elected REGENT.<note place="margin">And is chosen Regent.</note>

            <p>WHEN the King was set up, and the Power of the Regent almost settled, there was Quietness from Force and Arms, but the Peace was but Ticklish, Mens minds were yet in a Fermentation, and their Indignation, which they could not hide, did seem to portend some sudden Mischief. In this great uncertainty of Affairs, all Mens thoughts and Eyes were fixt upon, what the insuing Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament would do; The time of its Sitting was the 25<hi>th</hi> of <hi>August,</hi> where the Assembly was so Numerous, that no Man, ever before, remember'd the like Concourse. Therein the Authority of the Regent was confirm'd; but, about the Queen, they differ'd in their Opinions; for, it appearing by many Testimonies and Proofs, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially by her own Letters to <hi>Bothwel,</hi> that the whole Plot of the bloody Fact was laid by Her; Some being moved with the Hein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of the thing, and Others being afterwards made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted therewith by Her, lest They themselves should be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, as Accessories to so odious a Crime, to remove her Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony out of the way, Voted, That she should suffer the utmost extremity of the Law; but the Major part Sentenced Her on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be kept in Prison. After the Parliament rose, The Winter was spent in settling Judicatories, and punishing Delinquents. The Embassadors of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>English</hi> had Audience, they Both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd to see the Queen; but, she being a Prisoner on a publique Account, 'twas deny'd them: None but <hi>Bothwel</hi> was then in Arms; Whereupon some were sent with a Navy, to catch him as he was exercising Piracy near the <hi>Orcades</hi> and the Isles of <hi>Schetland.</hi> The publick Stock was then so low, that they were forc'd to borrow Mony of <hi>Iames Douglas,</hi> Earl of <hi>Morton,</hi> to rig and fit the Navy; so that his private Purse, at that Time, bore the Burden of the publick Charge. <hi>Bothwel</hi> was there, in a manner, secure, both because of the fierceness of Winter-Tempests, then raging in those Seas, which made them inaccessible for a Fleet; as also, because he knew the Treasury, which he himself had exhausted, could not afford Mony to set out One; so that by the sudden coming of <hi>William Kircade,</hi> of <hi>Grange,</hi> who commanded the Fleet, he was almost surpriz'd, some of his Company were taken,<note place="margin">

or else shrewdly Shaken, by the Tumults of the former Years. Which Proceeding of his was variously interpreted, according to Mens several Humours and Dispositions; The adverse Faction de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd every where against the Regent's Severity; or, as they phras'd it, Cruelty, which was formidable to them, who, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the greatness of their Offences, could not endure to be regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by the Law, in regard they had been us'd to Licentiousness in former Times: But, if the Queen were set at Liberty, some of them had Rewards; Others, Impunity, in their Eye, by which means many were drawn in to the contrary Faction; yea, some of those too, who had been Instruments in her Apprehension.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Maitland</hi> was as great an Enemy to <hi>Bothwel,</hi> (whom he look'd upon, as a vile and naughty Person, and one that would have cut his Throat,) as he was a Favourer of the Queen's Affairs, and because he was out of hope to overthrow him, as long as the Queen was alive, therefore he inclin'd, in the Parliament, to that side that would have had her punish'd according to Law. <hi>Iames Balfure</hi> was in the like Circumstances, as imagining <hi>Bothwel</hi> to be his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable Enemy, tho neither of them was thought innocent in the matter of the King's Death. But when <hi>Bothwel</hi> was taken, and kept Prisoner in <hi>Denmark,</hi> they then apply'd their Thoughts whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Deliverance of the Queen; not only, because they hop'd for an impunity of their common Crime more easily from her; but also, because, they thought, She, that had made away her Husband, would do but little better with her Son, whose Infancy and Shadow of Royal Name was That alone, which kept her from the Throne; but besides, they judg'd it also for their own Security, lest the Son should come to the Kingdom to be a Revenger of his Father's Death. Moreover, they were no obscure Conjectures, That the Queen's mind was not much abhorrent from such an Attempt; For she was often heard to say, The Child was not long-liv'd, for a skilful Astrologer had told her at <hi>Paris,</hi> that her first Child would not live above a Year, and (tis thought) that she her Self came once to <hi>Sterlin,</hi> in the same Hope, intending to bring the Child with her to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> which Suspicion caus'd <hi>Iohn Erskin,</hi> Governor of the Castle, not to suffer the Child to be taken from him; it also made a great part of the Nobility, then met at <hi>Sterlin,</hi> to associ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate themselves, by Oath, to maintain the said young Prince in Safety.</p>
            <p>Moreover, the <hi>Hamiltons,</hi> were, might and main, for freeing the Queen;<note place="margin">The Queen's Party, of which the <hi>Hamiltons</hi> were the chief, design Her De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, out of Durance.</note> because, if her Son were remov'd, by her means, They were one degree nearer to the Crown, and after that, 'twere no hard task to take her off also, because, she was hated of all for her Crimes; and having once been stopp'd in her Tyranny, would afterwards let forth the Reins looser, and more impetuously, to Cruelty. <hi>Argyle</hi> and <hi>Huntly,</hi> of which one had a Mother, the other a Wife, of the Family of the <hi>Hamiltons,</hi> did cherish their hopes, and wish'd them good Success, but they had also proper Reasons of their own to incline them so to do; because, neither of them was judg'd to be wholly ignorant, or guiltless, of the Queen's Crimes; Besides, <hi>William Murray</hi> of <note n="*" place="margin">In <hi>Strath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

both by Reason of his different Opinion, in point of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and bearing also a private Grudg against the Regent, tho he had been highly serviceable in taking the Queen; yet, did not only revolt from the Royal Party himself, but also drew a great many of his Friends along with him, upon proposal of no small Rewards to them. These were the Principals in delivering the Queen, there were many others also that fell in with their Party, whom either domestick Necessity, private Grudges, desire of Revenge, Hope of bett'ring their Fortune, or else Propinquity or Obligation to those above nam'd, did draw in and engage.</p>
            <p>In this troublesome state of Affairs, the Regent was equally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable against the Intreaties of his Friends, and the Threats of his Enemies, tho he knew, by the publick Libels, which they posted up and down, the Cause of their hatred, and their desire of Revenge: And tho some Astrologers, not unacquainted with the Plots design'd against him, did foretel, he should not live beyond such a Day; yet he persisted in his purpose, often saying,<note place="margin">The Regent remarkable Speech and Resolu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>That he knew well enough, he must die one time or other; and that he could never part with his Life more nobly or creditably, than by procuring the publick Tranquillity of his Native Country.</hi> And therefore, first, he summon'd a Convention of the Estates at <hi>Glasgow,</hi> whither the <hi>Lennox</hi> Men, the <hi>Renfroans</hi> and the Men of <hi>Clydsdale,</hi> were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to come, and whilst he was busied there, in the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of Justice, and in the punishment of Offenders, the Plot, so long agitated, for the Deliverance of the Queen, took effect. The manner of it was This. In the Castle, that the Queen was kept in, in <hi>Lough-Levin,</hi> there was the Regent's Mother, and his 3 Brother's by another Father, with abundance of other Women; yet, none were admitted to visit the Queen, but such as were well known; or else, that came by the Regents Order. Of these do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mestick Attendants, the Queen made choice of <hi>George Douglas,</hi> as fittest for her Purpose; He was the Regent's youngest Brother, a young Man, ingenious enough, and, by reason of his Age, apt to be impos'd upon by female Inticements; He, being something fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar with Her, on pretence to attend her in such Sports, as Courts, at idle times, refresh themselves withal, undertook to corrupt some of the common Servants of the Castle, by Gifts and Promises; and She, having intrusted him therein, would not deny any thing to such a Person, from whom she expected her Liberty; <hi>George</hi> then, having a promise of Indemnity from her for himself, and his Partizans, and being excited with the hopes of great Wealth and Power for the future, not without the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of his Mother, (as was verily thought) acted all that ever he could to bring the thing about. And tho some Persons did smell the Design, and acquainted the Regent therewith, yet he put such a confidence in Those he had plac'd there, that he chang'd none of the old Guard, only <hi>George</hi> himself was commanded out of the Island; whereupon, he departed to the next Village, on the edge of the <hi>Lough</hi>; where, having before corrupted the Officers of the Castle with Mony, he had, in a manner, a freer Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation with the Queen, by Letters, than before; whereupon,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:56771:335"/>
there were not only those <hi>Scots</hi> admitted to a partnership in the Plot, who were discontented at the present State of things, but the <hi>French</hi> were associated too, by <hi>Iames Hamilton,</hi> who had been Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent some Years before; and by <hi>Iames Beton,</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Glas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gow</hi>; the <hi>Scots</hi> were to do the Work, and the <hi>French</hi> to pay the Wages.</p>
            <p>About the end of <hi>April,</hi> an Embassador came from <hi>France,</hi> and, in the Name of his King,<note place="margin">An Embassador from <hi>France.</hi>
               </note> desir'd leave to visit the Queen, which, if he did not obtain, he pretended, he would presently depart. The Regent told him, 'twas not in his Power, That the Queen was not made Prisoner by him, neither could he determine any thing in the Case, without advising with Those who had first committed Her, and with Others who had afterward confirm'd by an Act of Parliament, what was done; Nevertheless he would gratify his Sister, and the King his Ally, in what he could, and would call an Assembly of the Nobles, the 20<hi>th</hi> of the next Month in order to that End. With that Answer the Embassador was somewhat paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and the Regent went on in his Judicatories; Whereupon the Queen,<note place="margin">The Queen escapes out of Prison, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Forces against the Regent.</note> having brib'd the Master of a Vessel, Her other Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons being sent about sleeveless Errands, was brought out of the <hi>Lough</hi>; Her escape being told to those that were then at <hi>Dinner</hi> in the Castle, they made a great stir, but to little purpose, for all the Boats were haled a Shore, and their Loop-holes, to put out their Oars, were all stopt up, so that no speedy Pursuit could be made. There were Horsemen expecting the Queen on the other side the <hi>Lough,</hi> who carried her to the several Houses of the Partizans in the Design, and the Day after, which was <hi>May</hi> the 3<hi>d,</hi> she came to <hi>Hamilton,</hi> a Town 8 Miles distant from <hi>Glasgow</hi>; when the thing was nois'd abroad, many came in to Her, some distrusting the King's Party, which they look'd upon as not very strong; Others in hope of Favour from the Queen; and some, in confidence of a Reward for their old Services, in this Tumult, discover'd their Minds; and part of them, having obtain'd Pardon for what was past, expecting the Event of Fortune, were but loose Adherents to the Regent. The Defection of others, was not so much won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred at, but the revolt of <hi>Robert Boyd,</hi> who, till that very Day, had obtain'd a great opinion for his Constancy, afforded matter of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course; He, being brought up on the ruins of a Noble Family (as I said before, in the life of King <hi>Iames</hi> the 3<hi>d,</hi>) parsimoniously and meanly under his Father, a valiant Man, and emulous of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Frugality, follow'd the same course of Life, as the rest of his Kin did, <hi>viz.</hi> by applying himself to richer Families to make way to repair his own, lately flourishing, but now decaying one, to their ancient Estate and Dignity. Whereupon, his Father and He first apply'd themselves to the <hi>Hamiltons,</hi> who were than up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permost. And when their Regentship was laid down, and the chief Magistracy settled in the Queen Dowager; and Controversies about Religion began to arise, he join'd himself to the Reformers, to which his Father was most averse. That Faction was accounted the most potent, to That he adher'd, till the Queen's coming out of <hi>France</hi>; yea, he grew very renown'd for his Constancy, Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:56771:335"/>
and Prudence; So that <hi>Gilespy,</hi> Earl of <hi>Argyle,</hi> was so taken with him, that he did almost nothing without his Advice. But, when some of the Nobles had associated at <hi>Sterlin,</hi> not for any Treasonable Project, but only to defend the King, he, indeed, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd the League too; but, with great Levity, both himself, and <hi>Argyle,</hi> who was guided by his Counsel, discover'd the whole In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue to the Queen. From that time forward, <hi>Boyd</hi> sided with the Queen, in all her Designs against his old Friends, being well reputed of on that side; but by those, he deserted, he was accounted a Turn-coat, and an inconstant Person. When the Queen was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Prison, <hi>Boyd</hi> apply'd himself to <hi>Murray</hi> the Regent, and was so well respected by him, for his industrious Ingenuity, that he was admitted into his Cabinet-Council; and tho several Opinions past upon him by others, yet he was in high Favour with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent at <hi>Glasgow</hi> in his Juridical Processes; but when he perceiv'd it was like to come to Blows, he went off privately to the Queen, and from thence sent a Letter to the Earl of <hi>Morton,</hi> by his Son, excusing his Departure, and alleging, he might probably do the <hi>Royalists</hi> as much Service, there, as if he had staid with them. His revolt, by reason of the good Opinion many had of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation and Manners, gave great occasion of Discourse.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the Regent had an hot Debate in Council, Whether they should stay, where they were, or else, go to the King at <hi>Sterlin</hi>? A great many were of opinion, that 'twas better to depart, and they urg'd Arguments for it; as, that <hi>Hamilton</hi> was a Town near them, full of People, and all the Clanships of that Family lay round about it: Besides, the Queen had with her 500 Horse, and it was reported, many more were making towards her from remoter Parts; whereas, with the Regent there were only a few of his own Friends, the rest having ran away to the Queen, or gone privately home, about their own Affairs, as if all things had been quiet; and, tho the Citizens of <hi>Glasgow</hi> were faithful enough, as being provok'd by the many and great Injuries they had receiv'd from the <hi>Hamiltons,</hi> when in Power; yet the Town it self was large, not very Populous, and every way approachable. On the contrary, Others reason'd, That all depended on the first Beginning of things; That his departure would be Dishonourable, and look like running away; That all Suspicion of fear was <hi>then</hi> principally to be avoided, for they should heighten their Enemies thereby, and discourage their Friends. On the one side, there were the <hi>Cuning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> and the <hi>Semples,</hi> potent Families; On the other side, <hi>Lennox,</hi> the King's peculiar Patrimony, from whence the next Neighbours might presently come in, in a few Hours; the rest, the next, or, at furthest, the Day after; In the interim, till further Aid came, they had strength enough, especially being assisted by the Towns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. This advice prevail'd in Council.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> Embassador posted betwixt both Parties,<note place="margin">The <hi>French</hi> Embassador busy betwixt the Parties,</note> rather as a Spy, than a Peace-maker, which yet he pretended to be; for, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, that there was but a small Force at <hi>Glasgow</hi> at first, and an Appearance of a great Multitude at <hi>Hamilton,</hi> he earnestly excited the Queen to put it to a Battel, presently. The Regent had ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered a party from the Neighbourhood, and expected those further

off from <hi>Merch</hi> and <hi>Lothian</hi>; there came in about 600 Horse, choice and resolute Men; he gave them one day to refresh themselves in, and then determined to march out to <hi>Hamilton,</hi> and to engage the Enemy immediately; for he believed, Delay was dangerous for him, and advantagious to the Enemy, whom the remote Parts of the Kingdom favour'd most. Two days after, he was inform'd, That, about the third Watch, the Enemy was drawing together from all places, where they quarter'd; they trusted to their Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, being about 6500 fighting Men, and they knew the Regent had scarce 4000; but they resolved to march by <hi>Glasgow,</hi> and to leave the Queen in <hi>Dunbarton</hi>-Castle, and so either to fight, or lengthen out the War, as they pleased; or, if the Regent should be so bold as to stop their Passage, which they believed he durst not do, they would then fight, and were confident they should beat Him. But he, having determined to urge them to fight before, as soon as ever he could, drew out his Men into the open Field before the Town, the way that he thought the Enemy would come, and there waited for them in Battel-array, for some Hours: But when he saw their Troops pass by the other side of the River, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently understood their Design, and commanded his Foot to pass over the Bridg, and his Horse to ford over the River, which they might do, it being low Water, and so to march to <note n="*" place="margin">Two Miles South of <hi>Glas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gow.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Langside,</hi> which was a Village by the River <hi>Carth,</hi> where the Enemies were to pass, scituated in the Foot of an Hill, respecting the South-West; on the East and North, the Passage was steep, but on the other side, there was a gentle Descent into a Plain, thither they hastned with such Speed, that the Royalists had neer possest the Hill, before the Enemy, who aim'd at the same place, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood their Design, though they march'd thither by a nearer Cut; But the Royalists met with Two Advantages, which was a great Discouragement to their Enemies; One, that <hi>Gilespy Cambel,</hi> Earl of <hi>Argyle,</hi> who commanded in chief, fell suddenly down from his Horse sick, and by his Fall, much delayed the March of his Party. The Other, that their Forces being plac'd here and there, in little Vallies, could never see all the Royalists at once, whose Paucity (as indeed, they were not many) made the Enemy to despise them, and the Disadvantage of the place, too. At last, when the Queen's Forces drew nigh, and saw the Ground which they aim'd at, possest by the Enemy, they went to another little Hill over against them, and there divided their Party into two Bodies: Their chief Strength they plac'd in the First; if they had overthrown their adverse Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty there, they knew, the rest would be dismaid at their Flight, and so they should overcome them without Fighting. The King's Party also divided themselves into Two Wings; <hi>Iames Douglas</hi> Earl of <hi>Morton,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A Fight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alists<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and the Queen's For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> 
               <hi>Robert Semple, Alexander Hume, Patrick Lindsy,</hi> each with his Clanship, were placed in the Right. In the left, stood <hi>Iohn</hi> Earl of <hi>Marr, Alexander</hi> Earl of <hi>Glencarn, William</hi> Earl of <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teith,</hi> and the Citizens of <hi>Glasgow.</hi> The Musqueteers were in the Village and Gardens below, near the high Way. Both Armies thus placed in Battel-array, The Queens Cannoneers and Foot were driven from their Posts by the King's Forces; on the other side, the King's Horse being fewer in Number, were beat back by the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:56771:336"/>
after they had performed that Service, they endeavoured also to break the Battalions of Foot, in order whereunto, they charg'd directly up the Hill, but were beat back by the King's Archers, and by some of those, who after their Rout, had rallied again, and joined with the rest of their Body: In the mean time, the left Wing of the Enemy march'd by the High-way, where there was a rising Ground, lower down into the Vally, where, though they were galled by the King's Musqueteers, yet passing by those Straits, they opened and ranged their Body; there 'twas, that the two Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailions held out a thick Stand of Pikes, as a Brest-work, before them, and fought desperately for half an Hour, without giving Ground on either side; insomuch that they, whose long Pikes were broke, threw Daggers, Stones, Pieces of Pikes or Lances; yea, whatsoever they could come by, into their Enemies Faces: But some of the hindermost Ranks of the King's Forces, being flying away, (whether for Fear or Treachery is uncertain) no doubt, their Flight had much disordered those who stood to it, unless the Ranks had been so thick, that the formost well knew not, what the hindmost did: Then they, which were in the second Battailion, taking notice of the Danger, and perceiving no Enemy coming to charge them, sent some whole Troops to wheel to the Right, and to join with the first; whereupon, the adverse Party could not bear their Charge, but were wholly routed and put to Flight; many were so inrag'd with Wrath and Hatred against them, that there had been a notable Slaughter in the Pursuit, unless the Regent had sent out Horse several ways, to forbid the Execution: The second Squadron of the Royalists stood so long, till they saw the Enemy scattering and flying in a disorderly manner; then they also brake their Ranks and pursued. The Queen stood about a Mile from the Place, to behold the Fight; and, after the Discomfiture, fled with some Horsemen of her Party, who had escap'd out of the Battel, toward <hi>England</hi>; the rest ran away as they could,<note place="margin">Wherein the Queen is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown, and flies for <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </note> each to his own home: There were but few slain in the Field, but more fell in the Pursuit, being wearied and wounded, all along the High-ways and Fields. The Number of the Slain, was about 300, but there were more taken Prisoners. Of the King's Forces, there were not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wounded, of the chief Commanders, none but <hi>Alexander Hume</hi> and <hi>Andrew Stuart,</hi> only one Man was slain; the rest of the Army, besides a few Horse-men, who followed the Pursuit very far, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned joyfully into the Town; where, after giving Thanks to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, for prospering their just Cause against a double Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of their Enemies, and for giving them, in a manner, an unbloody Victory, mutually gratulating one another, they went to Dinner.

            <p>The <hi>French</hi> Embassador expected the Event of the Fight,<note place="margin">The <hi>French</hi> Embassador sculks away, after the Fight.</note> and promis'd himself a sure Victory on the Queen's side; but being thus disappointed of his Hope, he put off his Vizard, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taking his Leave of the Regent, to whom he pretended he was sent, got a Party of Horse to guide him; and, with what Speed he could, made for <hi>England.</hi> In the way he was robb'd by <hi>Moss-Troo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers</hi>;

but <hi>Iames Douglas</hi> Laird of <hi>Drumlanerick,</hi> though he knew he was of the Enemies Party, yet deferr'd so much to the Honour and Name of an Embassador, that he caus'd his Goods to be restored to him.

The adverse Party plotted ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Ways to hinder it: Rumors were spread abroad of Aid from <hi>France,</hi> neither were they altogether without Ground: For some Troops were drawn down to the Sea-side, under the Command of the Earl of <hi>Martigues,</hi> a stout Man of the <hi>Luxemburgh</hi>'s Family, to be transported with all Speed into <hi>Scotland</hi>; and they had been so, unless the Civil Wars had on a sudden broke forth in <hi>France.</hi> But that Assistance would not have been so prejudicial to the Regent, as his Enemies thought, for it would have alienated <hi>England</hi> from them, and engaged It to him. Moreover, <hi>Argyle</hi> with 600 of his Clanship came to <hi>Glasgow,</hi> there he had a Conference with the <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miltonians,</hi> and other Leaders of the Faction, to hinder the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, but finding no way to do it, they went every Man severally home. <hi>Huntly</hi> also had gathered together a thousand Foot, against the Day of the Parliaments Sitting, he came as far as <hi>Perth,</hi> and there perceiving that the Fords of the River <hi>Tay,</hi> were guarded by <hi>William Ruven</hi> and the Neighbouring Nobility, who remained Loyal to the King, he retired without doing any thing to Purpose.</p>
            <p>About the same time, there came also Letters from the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> obtained by the Intercession of the adverse Party, to the Regent,<note place="margin">Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> of <hi>England</hi> doth in part a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopt the cause of the <hi>Scots</hi> Queen.</note> to put off the Parliament; she desired, that Judgment might not be hastned concerning the Rebels, till she were made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the whole Cause; for she could not well bear the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury and Affront, which the Queen, her Neighbour, and near Kinswoman, did pretend she had received from her Subjects. Tho the Request was but small in it self, yet, if it should have been granted, at the Instance of the Rebels, they might have thought to have carried all; either because such a Trifling and Delay seem'd to hearten them, and weaken their Enemy, especially seeing it might argue a Fear in the Royalists; and also, that they, in the mean
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:56771:337"/>
time, resolv'd to Indict a Convention in the Name of the Queen. But the Regent, being sensible of what great Consequence it was, to have the Parliament to sit; yea, though all the Force of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy had combin'd against it, resolved to keep his Day: In that Parliament, there was a great Debate, Whether all those who had took Arms against the King, and afterward had not obtained their Pardon, should be condemn'd as Traitors, and have their Goods con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiscate. But <hi>William Maitland,</hi> who favoured the Rebels, but co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertly, obtained, that only a few of them should be condemn'd at present, as a Terror to the rest; and a Door of Clemency should be opened to others, if they repented. That Procedure did won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully incourage the Conspirators, and increas'd their Obstinacy, in regard, they saw, their Punishment was deferr'd, and they were verily persuaded, that the Queen of <hi>England</hi> being their Queen's Neighbour and Kinswoman, nor the <hi>Guises,</hi> who then were very powerful in the <hi>French</hi> Court, nor the <hi>French</hi> King himself would suffer such an Encroachment to be made on the Royal Authority; yea, if they should be deserted by them, yet they were not so weak of themselves, as not to be able to maintain their Cause without fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Aid, as being superior in Number and Power; so that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was wanting to the Victory, but the empty Shadow of the Royal Name, which was (said they) usurped by Force.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the Regent minded only the publick Peace; some of the Neighbouring Offenders he fined in small Sums, and so took them into Favour; the Earl of <hi>Rothes,</hi> by his Friends Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession, was banish'd for three Years; as for the rest, he daily, by Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondents, solicited them to repent and come in; but perceiving, That many of them were obstinate, and inclined to Revenge, he levied an Army, and march'd into <hi>Annandale, Niddisdale,</hi> and lower <hi>Galway,</hi> where he took some Castles, and put Garisons into them; others, whose Owners were more refractary, he demolish'd, and in a short time, he would have ran over the whole Country, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Letters from the Queen of <hi>England</hi> had interrupted the course of his Victories. She was persuaded by the Exiles, That the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> had receiv'd much Wrong; That her ill-affected Subjects had laid unjust Imputations on her, and That she would not suffer the Royal Name to grow so cheap, or Majesty to be so contume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liously used, as to be exposed to the Wills of seditious Persons. That the Wrong of this great Wickedness redounded only to One, but the Example to All, and therefore, she desired, they would apply some speedy Remedy, that the Contagion of dethroning Princes might not spread further. Having made a great Harangue in her Letters to this purpose, against the Avengers of the King's Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; she desired of the Regent,
<q>That he would send Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to her, to inform her in the State of the whole Matter, and to make Answer to those, either Crimes or Reproaches, which were cast upon, and alleged against himself.</q>
This Demand seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very grievous and offensive, That things, already judg'd, should be called again in Question, to a new and hazardous Trial, and that before foreign Princes, who are oft-times emulous, if not E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, and their Minds already prepossess'd by Adversaries; yea,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:56771:338"/>
for a Man, as it were to plead for his own Life, before a foreign Judicature, though the Case was dangerous and hard, yet many Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments induc'd him to accept of the Proposal, though never so unequal.<note place="margin">Whereupon the Regent, with some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, meet the Queen of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>'s Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners at <hi>York</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate Matters.</note> Abroad, the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> the Queen's Uncle, rul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Being thus resolved to send Embassadors, he could not tell, Whom to pitch upon: The chief Nobles declining the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment: At last, the Regent himself resolved to go, and chuse Companions to accompany him, amongst whom was <hi>William Mait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> though much against his Will; but the Regent, knowing him to be a factious Man, and inclinable to the Queen's Party, did not think it safe to leave him behind, whilst things were in such a doubtful Posture at home; and therefore he persuaded him, by great Promises and Rewards, to accompany him, not doubting but to overcome his avaritious Mind with Largesses and Gifts; the rest went willingly along: The chief were, <hi>Iames Douglas,</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick Lindsy</hi> of the Nobles; of the Clergy, the Bishop of the <hi>Orca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> and the Abbat of <hi>Dumfermlin</hi>; of Lawyers, <hi>Iames Macgil,</hi> and <hi>Henry Balnavey</hi>; to whom he added a Ninth, <hi>viz.

               </note> yet Two things relieved his Thoughts, One was, the Equity of his Cause; the Other, the last Letters he received from the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> gave him Assurance, that, if the Crimes objected against the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> were true, she held her unworthy to hold that Scepter any longer. The Regent was a little heartned by those Letters, and with above a 100 Horse in his Company, he began his Journy, though he had certain Intelligence brought him, that the Earl of <hi>Westmorland,</hi> at the Command of the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> watch'd to intercept him, before he got to <hi>York</hi>; yet <hi>October</hi> 4. he came to <hi>York,</hi> the Place appointed for the Conference, and, the same Day, and almost hour,<note place="margin">A Plot to cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Thomas Howard,</hi> Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> entred the City, also. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, why an Ambush was laid for the Regent, was, because the Duke, by secret Correspondents, was dealing with the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> to marry her; and therefore, that the Suspicion of the King's Murder might be more easily taken away, she resolved, if the Regent were slain, to return home; and also to take and suppress the Letters she had wrote to <hi>Bothwel,</hi> containing a manifest Discovery of the Plot: but, because the Duke was so near, she could not so accomplish it, as that he also might not be aspersed with the Infamy of so cruel a Murder; and therefore the Plot was deferr'd till another time. Besides <hi>Norfolk,</hi> there were appointed Two other Commissioners by the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> to determine the Controversies of the <hi>Scots,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Sussex,</hi> who inclined to <hi>Howard</hi>'s Party, as 'twas common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reported, and Sir <hi>Ralph Sadler,</hi> an indifferent and equal Person. Within a few days, there came Messengers from the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> to complain of her disobedient Subjects, and also to desire leave of the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> to return home, without Delay; they had their Hearing apart from the Regent, and his Attendants: First, they Protested, that they came not before them as Judges, that had a
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:56771:338"/>
lawful Superiority over them; then they made a long Harangue, What Wrong the Queen had received from her Subjects; and after, desired of the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> that either she would persuade her ungrateful Subjects to admit their Prince; or, if they refused, then she would supply her with an Army, to force them so to do. After some few Hours, the Regent was heard; He stood upon the Equity of his Cause, before indifferent Judges; He pleaded, that the Royalists had done nothing, but according to the ancient Laws and Customs of their Nation, and that, in full Parliament, ratified and approved; and that he being a single Person, with those few with him, could not abrogate any thing which had been enacted by common Consent of all the Estates in Parliament. But when the <hi>English</hi> Commissioners told them, they could not be satisfied with those Statutes made at their Parliaments at home, and now produced, unless withal they produced the Reasons, which moved the Nobles to such a severe Judgment against the Queen: The Regent was unwilling, as much avoiding to divulge the foul Offences of the Queen, being his Sister also, and that amongst Foreigners, who were forward enough to hear them, and therefore denied to do it, unless upon these Terms, That,<note place="margin">Disputes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of both Sides.</note> if he made good the Charge against the Queen, that she killed her Husband, then the Queen of <hi>England</hi> should stipulate and promise to defend the young King's Cause, and take him as 'twere into her Protection. But when the <hi>English</hi> Embassadors told them, that they had only a Commission to hear the Demands of both Sides, and so to lay the whole Matter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Queen. The Regent again urg'd them to obtain such a Promise from their Queen, or else that they themselves should get a Commission, fully to decide the Controversy; if they would do That, he promised, that unless he did evidently make it appear, that the King was slain by his Wives Means, he would not deprecate the Punishment due to the most heinous Offence. The Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners wrote to the Queen to know her Mind herein; who returned Answer,<note place="margin">Upon their Disagreement, Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> avokes the Cause to <hi>London.</hi>
               </note>
               <q>That the <hi>Scots</hi> of the Royal Party should send one or more of their Number to her Court, who might fully acquaint her with the Merits of their Cause, and then she would consult, what was fit for her to do.</q>
Whereupon the Regent sent <hi>William Mait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> on whom many sinister Opinions did daily arise, and <hi>Iames Macgil,</hi> not so much to be his Assistant in publick Business, as to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, what his Actions were. The Causes which made <hi>Maitland</hi> suspected were These, amongst many others: Before his Journy into <hi>England,</hi> though he mightily endeavoured to conceal his Designs,<note place="margin">Commissioners sent to <hi>London</hi> by the Regent.</note> yet by his Words and Actions, and further, by his great Familiarity with the Men of the adverse Party; but more clearly yet, by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, he sent to the Queen, which were intercepted, they could not be hid. In those Letters he endeavoured to persuade the Queen, that his Service might yet be useful to her, using the Example of the Lion, as 'tis in the Fable, who, being taken in a Net, was freed by such mean Animals as Rats. And after he came to <hi>York,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Maitland</hi> not true to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent.</note> there was scarce a Night, wherein he did not meet with the chief Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors of the adverse Party, compared Notes with them, and acquainted them with the Designs of the Regent. The Regent
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:56771:339"/>
did not forbid those Meetings, knowing, he should do no Good there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, only then they would meet more secretly. Though these were manifest Evidences of his Treachery, yet casually there happen'd an undeniable Demonstration thereof. <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and He, went abroad, pretendedly to hunt, where they had much Discourse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the whole Affair, and came to this Agreement amongst themselves, to spin out the matter, if 'twas possible, and so to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay it, that, at last, nothing might be done, and yet the Cause not seem wholly deserted, neither. For, by this means, the Regent must depart, without effecting what he came for; or else, some Commotion at home would inforce him so to do, and then other Remedies might emerge, in time: For <hi>Norfolk</hi> was then designing a Civil War, how to take off the <hi>One</hi> Queen, and to marry the <hi>Other. Maitland</hi> inform'd <hi>Iohn Lesly,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Ross,</hi> herewith, one intimately acquainted with all the Queen's Affairs, who accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly inform'd his Mistress, by Letter, how the Duke would have her write to Court, what Course to steer for the future; and tho her Cause went but slowly on, yet that Delay should not hinder her from expecting a good Issue thereof. The Queen having read those Letters, laid them by, as loose Papers, so that they came to be read by diverse others; and, from hand to hand, were, at last, brought to the Regent, who, by them, discovered the main of his Adversaries Design against him; as for <hi>Maitland,</hi> he had experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented his Perfidiousness many times before.</p>
            <p>When the Embassadors, before-mentioned, came to the Queen at <hi>London,</hi> She, and her Council, thought it best, that the Regent himself should come up, and so dispute the Controversy, by word of Mouth:<note place="margin">The Regent himself comes to <hi>London.</hi>
               </note> Whereupon, he dismiss'd part of his Retinue, and, with the rest, went to <hi>London</hi>; but there he met with the same Difficulty as he had done at <hi>York</hi>; for he refus'd to enter upon the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation of the Queen, and his Sister too, unless, if he prov'd her Guilty, the Queen of <hi>England</hi> would take the <hi>Scots</hi> King's Party in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her Protection; if she would do That, he would begin the Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation immediately, upon the same Terms, as he had propounded to the Delegates at <hi>York.</hi> Whilst these things were acting in <hi>London,</hi> the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi>

And moreover, she caus'd Rumours to be spread abroad, That the Regent, and his Companions, were committed Prisoners to the Tower of <hi>London</hi>; and foreseeing, that Lie could not be long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, she devis'd another, (<hi>i. e.</hi>) That the Regent had promis'd to subject <hi>Scotland</hi> to the Crown of <hi>England</hi>; and, That he was to give up the King, as a Pledg thereof. 'Tis thought, her Design herein, was, That, whereas she had promis'd the same things by her Commissioners; and the <hi>English</hi> look'd upon it, as a Vanity in her, seeing She had no power to perform it; yet she was willing to possess the Minds of the Vulgar with an Untruth, and so to raise
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:56771:339"/>
up Envy against the Regent; and, if she could not avert the whole Reproach from her self, yet, at least, she would have her Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries bear a Part with her, therein.</p>
            <p>When the Regent saw himself in these Straits, he resolv'd to end the Matter, as well as he could, and so to return home:<note place="margin">The Regent manages his Accusation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Queen and her Party,</note> Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, at the earnest Sollicitation of the <hi>English,</hi> who desir'd to know the Causes of the Proceedings in <hi>Scotland,</hi> (without which they could determine nothing;) he also, being desirous to satisfy the Queen of <hi>England</hi> at that time, whom he could nor offend, without great prejudice to his Cause; and, being willing also to return home to extinguish the Civil War, then appearing in its first Rise, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of which he could well do, unless the Queen of <hi>England</hi> was his Friend, or, at least, not his Adversary; induc'd by these Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, He first protested before the Council of <hi>England,</hi> That 'twas not willingly, but by the importunity of his Enemies, that he was compell'd to accuse his Queen, and she his Sister's Son too, of so horrid a Crime; that he did not do it out of a wanton humour to accuse, but out of necessity to clear himself; for he was very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to discover those things, which he wish'd, if possible, might be cover'd in perpetual Oblivion; and therefore, if any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection were made on what he did, the Envy ought deservedly to light upon Those, who would not suffer him to be like Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, that is, to obey his Prince chearfully, when Good; and to reprove Him, or Her, against his Will, when she was Evil; only he desire one Thing, That the Queen's Proxies, who had inforced him to that Dispute, might be present to hear the Crimes objected; that so, if they were false, they might dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them before the Council; and that he himself, in many weighty Matters, might also make use of their Testimonies. The Queen's Commissioners refus'd this, as putting little Confidence in their own Cause, and insisted only on this one thing, That the Queen, who was, by Force of Arms, ejected, might be restor'd: Whereupon, a Day was appointed for the Regent to shew Cause, why the Revengers of the King's Murder had taken up Arms, (for he himself was then in <hi>France,</hi>) and had ejected the Queen from her Government, and acted other things, as, till that time, they had done. When the Time came, he declar'd the Order of all Things, as they had been acted, and the Testimonies of the Partisans of the King's Murder, made before their Deaths; and also the Statute of Parliament, to which many of the Regent's Accusers had subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed: And when the Silver Cabinet was produc'd, which the Queen had given her from her former Husband <hi>Francis,</hi> and had bestow'd on <hi>Bothwel,</hi> in which were Letters to <hi>Bothwel,</hi> writ in <hi>French,</hi> with the Queen's own Hand, and also a <hi>French</hi> Poem, not unelegantly compos'd by her; and also the Manner of the King's Death, and, after his Death, her Surprize, and three Contracts of Marriage with him, the <hi>One</hi> before the Parricide, written with her own Hand, wherein, as by a Bill, she promises to marry him, as soon as ever she was freed from her former Husband: The <hi>Other</hi> was, before the Divorce from his former Wife, writ by <hi>Huntly</hi>'s Hand: The <hi>Third</hi> was openly made, a little before the Marriage. When all this was
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:56771:340"/>
produc'd, seen, and read before the Council: The whole Fact was so plainly expos'd, that now no Doubt could be made, Who was the Author of it.

               </gap>, lest the Example of driving out Princes might creep into the Neighbour-Kingdoms, wrought much upon her: Besides, she was afraid of <hi>France,</hi> for the Peace with them was not very sure or firm; and then especially, the <hi>French</hi> Embassador did plead the Cause of the banish'd Queen daily. The <hi>Spanish</hi> Embassador was desir'd also to interpose his Mediation; but the foulness of the Crimes did so deter him, that he refus'd to meddle therewith. Whereupon, the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> that she might leave a Door for Repentance, if Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters should succeed amiss in <hi>France,</hi> and not cut off all occasion of gratifying them, gave a middle Answer, so tempering it, that at present she said, She saw no cause to the contrary, but that all things had been acted according to Law and Justice in <hi>Scotland</hi>; yet, as if she deferr'd the compleat Decision till another time, she desir'd, that seeing intestine Tumults did recal the Regent, he would leave here one of his Retinue in his Place, to make Answer to those Crimes, which might be objected against him in his Absence. But the Regent, who saw the Matter to be so put off, that That Queen might take her Measures to give Sentence for her own Advantage, and the Event of foreign Affairs, left no Stone unturn'd, that he might have the Cause fully determin'd, now; and therefore he desir'd, as most just and equitable, that if his Enemies, who had long studied before-hand to accuse him, had any thing to allege, they would now produce it, and not watch an Opportunity to calumniate him in his Absence, seeing they refus'd to cope with him face to face; he was not ignorant, what Rumors his Enemies would cause to be spread amongst the People, and what they had already said to some of the Council, and to the <hi>French</hi> Embassador; and therefore, he earnestly desir'd of the Council, to command them not to mutter privately, but to declare openly, what they had to say; and that he would not make such haste home, but that, though it were much to his own Damage, and the Publicks, yet he would willingly purge himself there, in presence. Whereupon, the Commissioners of the banish'd Queen were sent for, and demanded, If they had any thing to allege against the Regent or his Companions, in reference to the King's Murder, they should produce it. Their Answer was, They had nothing at present, but they would accuse them, when they were commanded by their Queen. The Regent answer'd, That he was always ready to give an account of all the Actions perform'd by him; neither would he shun either Time or Place so to do; ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

him, in a very short Time, all Domestick Tumults would be quieted; and the Queen, even without Blood, would recover her Crown and Dignity, again. Whereunto the King's Embassadors answer'd,<note place="margin">The Royalists answer their Reasons, in a large discourse.</note>
               <q>That <hi>Hamilton</hi> desir'd a Thing, not only contrary to the Lavvs and Customs of their Ancestors, but, if the consideration of the Law vvere omitted, yet 'twas very unjust in it self; for our Ancestors (said they) by reason of the Slaughters of their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by their Kindred, for 1300 Years ago, did vvholly change the Method of their Assemblies in making a King: For, as before, in the Family of <hi>Fergus,</hi> our first King, after the King's Death, it was not the next of Blood, but he, that was most fit, was chosen King, by Suffrage: So, <hi>Kenneth</hi> the 3<hi>d,</hi> that he might take away all Plots against Princes, by those of their Blood, and also might prevent the cruel and bloody Emulations of their Kindred amongst themselves, made this Decree of Succession, that now is, for the next of Blood to inherit. And Men, by Experience, finding, that in so great an Inconstancy of Fortune, 'twas scarce possible, but that sometimes the Right of Chief Magistracy should fall on a Child, or else, on one unable to govern; therefore they decreed, That he, who preceded others in Power and Wisdom, should undergo the Administration of the Government, in the mean time; and our Ancestors, observing this Course for almost 600 Years, have trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted down a Kingdom safe to us: Thus, when <hi>Robert Bruce</hi> died, there succeeded Regents chosen by most Voices, <hi>Thomas Randolf,</hi> Earl of <hi>Murray; Donald,</hi> Earl of <hi>Marr; Andrew Murray, Iohn Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolf, Robert Stuart</hi>; sometimes particular Persons, sometimes more than one, were chosen, by our publick Conventions, to that Office: So, when <hi>Iames</hi> the Second was a Child, <hi>Alexander Levingston</hi> was appointed his Governour, who was no way rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to that King in Blood, no, nor a Noble Man neither, but a Knight only, more eminent for his Wisdom than his Family. And if any say, That was for want of some of the King's Line; the Excuse will not hold; for, at that very time, there was <hi>Iohn Kennedy,</hi> chief of his Family, his Nephew, by the Sister of <hi>Iames</hi> the First, a Man both wise and virtuous; there were also his Uncles, <hi>Iames Kennedy,</hi> Archbishop of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nentest Person for Virtue in the whole Kingdom; and also his Brothers, the Son of the King's Aunt, <hi>Douglas,</hi> Earl of <hi>Angus; Archibald</hi> also, Earl of <hi>Douglas,</hi> was not excluded from the King's Line, but in Power was almost equal to him; to be sure, he was superiour to all others; yet none ever complain'd of the Injustice of our Assemblies in so doing. And not long after, <hi>Iames</hi> the Third had four Tutors or Guardians assign'd him, not taken on the account of Alliance, but chosen by Vote. And of late, <hi>Iohn,</hi> Duke of <hi>Albany,</hi> was sent for by the Nobility out of <hi>France,</hi> to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern <hi>Scotland,</hi> in the Minority of <hi>Iames</hi> the 4<hi>th</hi>; and when he came, he was setled in the Regency, by a publick Statute, enacted in a Convention of the Estates, which was not done on the account of Proximity in Blood; for he had <hi>Alexander,</hi> an elder Brother, one perhaps inferiour to him, yet far more virtuous than <hi>Iames Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> who, for a season, affected that Dignity: But, in the Absence
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:56771:341"/>
of <hi>Iames</hi> the Fifth, <hi>Robert,</hi> his Uncle, manag'd the Kingdom. I pray, by what Right? Was he assum'd into that Office for Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinquity of Blood? No: Was he elected by the People? No, nor that neither? How was he then created? I'le tell you, how; When King <hi>Robert</hi> the Third was neither, in Body nor Mind, fit to manage the Kingly Office, he set up <hi>Robert,</hi> his Brother, in his stead, and commended his Children to his Care; <hi>David,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Cruelty of <hi>Robert</hi> against his Brother's Children.</note> his el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest Son, he starv'd to Death; <hi>Iames,</hi> the younger, had been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so slain, unless he had saved his Life by Flight: And, being thus setled in the Possession of the Government, his Brother dying for Grief, he kept it, without the Consent of the People in Parliament, and deliver'd it down by Hand, to his Son <hi>Mordacus.</hi> How <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> the King, that died last, stood affected towards his Brother, is very plain; for, as when he was a dying, he abominated and curs'd him, as the Executioner of his Children; so, certainly if he had been alive, and in Health, he would not have designed him Guardian to his Children. We are so put in mind of that time, wherein, after the Death of <hi>Iames</hi> the Fifth, he himself was made Regent; (as if any thing at all was legally acted, since that time.) When Cardinal <hi>Beton</hi> endeavoured, by Fraud, to invade the chief Magistracy, he crept into the vacant Office, rather out of Peoples Hatred to <hi>Beton,</hi> than Love to Him; being got into it, he ruled with great Cruelty and Avarice; and, not many years ago, he sold that Magistracy, which he got by Force, and the Queen too, then committed to his Care; therein was manifested, what Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction the People bare to him, when they preferred the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Woman-Stranger before that bitter Slavery they suffer'd under him. You see then, I suppose, how this Request of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton</hi>'s is contrary to the Laws of our Country, and the Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our Ancestors; yea, so contrary, that for want of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to maintain it, he bolsters it up only with Lies: And if there were any Custom of this kind, all Men see, how unjust it is: For what can be more unequal, than to commit the innocent and weak Age of the Prince to his Care, who either daily expects, or wishes for, the Death of his Pupil? All whose Family hath born, and doth bear, great and lasting Enmity with the Family of the King, that now reigns. What Safeguard can there be here, in Nearness of Blood, against ancient Hatred, griping Avarice, and the precipitate Force of forestalled Tyranny? <hi>Laodice,</hi>

of a most powerful Prince? Who doth not know the Calamities, that followed upon that cruel Parricide? The brave fertile Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of <hi>Italy</hi> was almost made a Wilderness, thereby; The Family of the <hi>Sforza</hi>'s, from whence so many valiant Men proceeded, was extinguish'd; and the Barbarians were introduc'd into the pleasant Country, about the <hi>Po</hi>; whose Avarice and Cruelty spoil'd all. Besides, who is there, of the Inhabitants of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> that hath not heard of the Cruelty of <hi>Richard</hi> the 3<hi>d,</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> against his Brother's Children? And with how much Blood, was that Parricide expiated? If Men that were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise prudent, did not fear to commit such things against their nearest in Blood, excited only by the desire of the Crown, What can be expected from him, whose Inconstancy is well known to all, and whose ill management of the Government hath already cost us so much Blood? Whose Family, not content with the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of this King's Great Grandfather, did always work Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry against his Grandfather by the Mother's side, as long as he liv'd; and, as for his Grandfather by his Father's side, when he could not kill him, he drove him, poor, out of the Kingdom; his Father he brought forth as a Sacrifice to be slain; his Mother and the Kingdom, when they could not enjoy it themselves, they sold it to Strangers, and after, by the Providence of God, she was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd from that Bondage, they cast her into those Straits, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in she now is. What Judgment the Subjects made of these things, may appear by this, That Men seem'd to themselves deliver'd from the Prison of a most miserable Bondage, and to tast the sweetness of Liberty, when they sold the Government, which they themselves, were not able to manage, to a Woman-Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the hearing of this Oration, the Queen told <hi>Hamilton,</hi> That his Demand was unjust,<note place="margin">The Queen of <hi>England</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares against <hi>Hamiltons</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign for the Regency.</note> and, That she would not assist him therein; but That she was desir'd by the King's Embassadors, not to suffer him to depart, (in regard he plotted nothing but Sedition) till they likewise went, themselves; which, she look'd upon, as a just thing, and therefore had promis'd them so to do, and thereupon she charg'd him, not to depart before that time. Moreover, the banish'd Queen encourag'd her Friends with the hopes of her speedy Return; for some Letters of hers were intercepted, wherein she advis'd them, to seize upon as many Castles and fortified Places as they could; and so to disperse the War abroad, as far as ever they were able: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther need they fear the noise of a Truce, or Accomodation, for, if Matters were ended that way, all the Offences of former times would be cover'd, and forgiven, under the umbrage of Peace: But, if it should brake forth into open War, the more Garisons they had, the greater opportunity would be put into their Hands, to hurt the Enemy.</p>
            <p>When the Regent had settled Matters, as well as he could, in <hi>England,</hi> and had leave to return, some Letters were produc'd, lately intercepted, from the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> wherein she complains, That she was otherwise treated by the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> than she her self first expected; or, as was promis'd her, and that was done
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:56771:342"/>
by some Courtiers, who were the Cause, That she was not sent back with an Army, as, she affirm'd,<note place="margin">A Marriage de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed between the Queens of <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</hi>
               </note> the Queen of <hi>England</hi> had promis'd Her; but she did hope, shortly, to obtain a good issue another Way, (for Messengers often had passed betwixt Her, and <hi>Howard,</hi> about a Marriage between them) and therefore, she wish'd them not to be discouraged, but to increase the strength of their Party, to make a general Disturbance, and, by all the Arts they could, to hinder the Regent's return into <hi>Scotland.</hi> These Letters, being divulg'd, did affect People, severally. The Queen of <hi>England</hi> took it ill, That she was accus'd of breach of Promise; as also, That the Conditions of the Truce, made by her means, were not kept: and therefore, being very angry and inrag'd, she remitted much of her ancient Favour to the <hi>Scot's</hi> Queen, and was more inclin'd to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, than before.

When they came to <hi>Glasgow,</hi> a Day was appointed, wherein they and their Friends should profess their Allegiance to the King, and so recover their old Estates and Honours; In the mean time, they were to remain in Prison, or, to give in Hostages, of their Kindred, for their forth-coming. This also was added to the Conditions, That all of the same Party might come in, if they pleas'd, on the same Terms. <hi>Argyle</hi> and <hi>Huntly</hi> refus'd to subscribe to those Articles, either out of anger to <hi>Hamilton,</hi>

For, whilst these things were acted in <hi>Scotland,</hi> Letters came from the exiled Queen, containing large Promises, and willing them not to be terrifi'd with vain Threats, for she should shortly be with them, with a great Army. Their Minds were ready to receive this News; and so much the rather, because the Queen was kept with a looser Guard than ordinary; and there was daily talk of her Marriage with <hi>Howard.</hi> When <hi>Hamilton</hi> was come to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi>

                  <hi>Hamilton's</hi> Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giversation;</note> at the Day appointed, he eluded his Promise, by va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Postulations and Pretences, making many Delays; as, that the rest of his Party should come together, and so be all comprehended at once in one Agreement: And also, that they might send to the Queen to know her Mind; and to this end he desir'd to defer the Matter, till the 10<hi>th</hi> day of <hi>May.</hi> To this his plain Mockery, they answer'd, That 'twas to no purpose for him to expect <hi>Argyle</hi> and <hi>Huntly,</hi> for they had declar'd, they would manage their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns apart. As for the Queen, 'twas demanded, if she did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the Capitulation, what they would do. Then <hi>Hamilton</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd ingenuously enough, but not so prudently for the time, That he was compell'd to those Conditions, by the Force and Terror of an Army, and that if he were left free to himself, he would not subscribe any thing thereof; This their Baffle being open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly discover'd,<note place="margin">For which he is imprisoned.</note> The Regent committed <hi>Hamilton</hi> and <hi>Maxwel</hi> to <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinburgh</hi> Castle. The rest of the Dispute was about <hi>Argyle</hi> and <hi>Huntly.</hi> For <hi>Argyle,</hi> whilst the Regent was in <hi>England,</hi> came to <hi>Glasgow,</hi> to consult about publick Affairs, with about 1500 Men in his Company; Thither also came many of the neighbour Countries of the same Faction; where they differ'd in their Opinions, and agreed in nothing, but only to disturb the Publick Peace. The <hi>Hamiltonians</hi> desir'd of <hi>Argyle,</hi> That, in regard the Inhabitants of <hi>Lennox</hi> were firm to the King's Cause, he would vex them, by
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:56771:343"/>
driving away Preys from them, that so he might draw them, tho unwilling, to his Party; or else, might so impoverish them, that they might not much advantage their own Party. When <hi>Argyle</hi> had communicated the thing to the Council of his Friends, not one of them favour'd his Design; For they remembred, That for many Years, the <hi>Lennoxians</hi> had been much addicted to <hi>Argyle,</hi> and that there were many Alliances, between them. Moreover, said they, Why are the <hi>Argyle</hi> Men nearer to the <hi>Lennoxians,</hi> than the <hi>Hamiltonians,</hi> seeing they lie in the middle betwixt them Both? why then should they put a Service, so full of <hi>odium,</hi> upon him? Seeing it was their own Affair, principally; let them appear <hi>first</hi> in it, and then <hi>Argyle</hi> would not be wanting; He would be a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, not a Leader, in such a plundering Expedition. When that Assembly had held some Days, it was dissolv'd, without doing any thing, and <hi>Argyle</hi> return'd, thrÃ´ <hi>Lennox,</hi> which was his nearest way, without doing them any hurt; which Moderation of his did indear him, even to the chief of the opposite Faction, and made his Pardon more easily obtainable.</p>

These two Men, seeing their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns were several, had a Council assign'd, to meet at St. <hi>Andrews.</hi> Thither <hi>Argyle</hi> came first: He was easily reconcil'd; for, that Year, and the Former, he had committed no hostile Act; and besides, he was the Regent's Kinsman, and, from his Childhood, his great Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, and familiar Friend; So that all he requir'd of him, was, an Oath to be Faithful to the King for the future; which if he were not, besides the usual punishment of the Law, he did not deprecate, but that he was to be accounted the basest Person living; the rest also were admitted into Favour, upon the same Oath, but on far different Conditions.

               </note> was long debated in Council. For, whereas in <hi>England,</hi> the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of the Exile Queen with <hi>Howard</hi> was carry'd on, and their coming into <hi>Scotland</hi> was privately design'd; their Faction there did, by degrees, take heart, and incourage the Rebellious to Disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: For, if Matters were put into a Confusion, they thought, the new King would have an easier entrance to possess the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; Wherefore, when they knew, That the Regent would not be persuaded to betray the King, as being his Guardian and Uncle, they endeavour'd, by all means, to abridg his Power. For, besides Those, that openly took Arms against the King, a great part of the Counsellors, did not now, as heretofore, favour <hi>Huntly</hi> in secret, but openly; they pleaded for him, might and main, That he should be indemnified for what was past; for that was the readiest and safest way to Agreement; yea, 'twas more creditable for the State, to heal civil Breaches without Violence, and not to proceed to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture of Goods or loss of Life; and, by this means, Peace might be obtain'd at Home and Renown Abroad. But if a military Course
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:56771:344"/>
were taken, they must fight with a Man, who, by reason of his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Power, his great Alliance; and by his many Clanships, was very formidable; and if he were overcome, (which yet was uncertain) yet he might fly to the <hi>Highlands</hi> and Mountainous Deserts, or to foreign Kings; where, out of a small spark of Disgust, a mighty flame of War might, in time, be kindled. On the other side, 'twas al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged, That the War would not be so formidable, as some imagin'd. For his Father, tho he had the Report of a very prudent Man, even whilst his Force was intire, was yet easily subdued; and therefore, this young Man, whose Power was not yet establish'd, and besides, was discourag'd by the recent calamity of his Family, was never able to bear up against all the Power of the Kingdom, and the Majesty of the Kingly Name too; and, if he were overcome in fight; or, if distrusting his Forces, he fled to the Mountains, there were Those, who, by the same Largesses, as he had firm'd them for his Service, or by greater, might be induc'd either to kill him, or to betray him to the Regent. <hi>For the Faith of Mercenaries is changed with Fortune, they follow the Prosperous, and forsake the Afflicted.</hi> As for foreign Kings,<note place="margin">Sententious Maximes in Policy.</note> 
               <hi>They esteem'd Men, according to their Power, neither were they concern'd for anothers Misery, but respected only their own Advantage.</hi> But if any King of another Kidney should be so Courteous and Merciful, as to entertain a Fugitive, and a Beggar too; yet now, the Times were such as did cancel that fear. For <hi>England,</hi> alone, of all <hi>Europe,</hi> was the Country, which enjoy'd a flourishing Peace, and That favour'd the King's Cause; but other neighbour Kingdoms were so busied with domestick Dissensions, that they had no time to look Abroad; And if they had leisure so to do, yet there was some ground of Hope, That Equity would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail more with them, than Mercy towards Exiles, who were Rebels to their own Kings, and Faithless to the Kings of other Nations; As for the Indemnity, which, they say, will declare our Clemency; it will rather be an Argument of our Negligence, in regard, a just Combate being declin'd thrÃ´ Fear, a War is imprudently nourish'd under a pretence of Peace, and that an unjust pretence too, which would incourage the crest-fallen Spirits of the Rebels, and weaken the chearful endeavours of the King's best Friends. For, how do you think, will both Parties stand affected; When the one side sees, That all is lawful for them, without present punishment, and so they hope it will be for the future? And the other sees perfidious Enemies to enjoy the Rewards of their wicked Crimes, themselves robbed of all their Goods, and vexed with all the Calamities of War; and whereas they expected a Reward for their Faithfulness and Constancy, instead thereof to be punish'd for their Love to their King and Country; And therefore, who can doubt, but that, if Matters hereafter come to Arms, (which of necessity they must do, unless this Fire be now quenched, before it break forth) who, I say, can doubt, but that Party will be strongest, which thrives by its Wickedness, and who may do all things with Impunity, rather than the other, who must suffer all injuries offer'd to them forcibly, <hi>gratis?</hi> And if those Inconveniencies did not attend this vain shew of Clemency; yet, neither the Regent, nor the King himself,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:56771:344"/>
could lawfully <hi>so</hi> Pardon, as to give away the Goods of the Robbed to their Plunderers: If they should do that, They must lay down the Persons of Rulers, and take upon them the habit of Spoilers, too; if such a Condition should be granted, it were much more Cruel, for People to be despoil'd of their Estates by Kings, <hi>the Granters of Indemnity,</hi> than by their very Enemies, and Toryes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, that robbed them. Many things having been alternately canvas'd, and alleged, to this purpose, on either side: Those which were for his Indemnity were out-voted, by a few Voices. The Regent declar'd, That, for Peace-sake, he was very willing to Pardon the private wrongs done to himself and the King; but,<note place="margin">Yet, at last the Regent par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons him, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Terms.</note> for the Injuries offer'd to particular Persons, he neither could, nor would, Pardon them: But if <hi>Huntly</hi> and those Friends of his, who follow'd his Party, could make some Terms of Agreement with those they had plunder'd, he was very willing, by the Consent of both Parties, to appoint Arbitrators, who might adjust the value of the Losses.</p>
            <p>Peace, as 'twas thought, being settled on these Conditions, there was another Dispute arose, seemingly small, but manag'd with greater eagerness, than before; The Controversy was, Whether Pardon were to be given to all of <hi>Huntly</hi>'s Party, promiscuously? or, Whether every Mans Cause and Desert should be consider'd, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part? Some were of Opinion, that, because they thought <hi>Huntly</hi> was dealt hardly with in being inforc'd to pay D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>mages to the Sufferers, that it was equitable to indulge him here, and not to press so severely, as to disoblige his Followers, also: On the other side, 'twas alleged, That the chief aim, in such kind of Wars, was, to dissolve Factions, and that could not be done easily, any otherwise, than if the judgment of Pardon or Punishment did reside in the Breast of the Prince alone: All Men understand, how unjust it is, to impose an equal Fine on Those, whose Offences are unequal; and that the adjusting of the Punishment, should be left to <hi>Huntly</hi> himself, was, by no means, fit, for he ('twas probable) would exact the lightest Mulct from the greatest Offenders; and would lay almost the whole Burden upon such as were least Nocent; in regard, in impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Punishment, he would not weigh each Man's Merit, but rather his Propensity to his Service; and as any Man had been more fierce and cruel in the War, so he would obtain from him an higher Place in his Favour. On the other side, the lightest Offenders would have the sorest Punishment, and they, which were less active in Wickedness, should be fined for their Moderation, and Favour, towards the King. These Reasons so prevail'd with the Council, that they decreed to weigh every Man's Case apart; and yet, that they might seem to gratify <hi>Huntly</hi> in some thing, his Domesticks were exempted, he was to lay a Fine on them himself, as he pleas'd; But that which he most desir'd, that the Regent should not come with an Army into the North-parts, was absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refus'd him.</p>
            <p>Things being thus settled with <hi>Huntly</hi> at St. <hi>Andrews</hi>; the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, with two Bands of Souldiers, and a great Number of his Friends, went first to <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> then to <hi>Elgin,</hi> at last to <hi>Inverness</hi>:
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:56771:345"/>
The Inhabitants near the Town were commanded to appear, they obeyed the Summons, some paid down their Mony, imposed as a Fine on them, others gave Sureties: <hi>Huntly,</hi> and the chief of his Septs and Clanships, put in Hostages. Thus having settled the Country towards the North, being highly gratulated by all good Men, through all his March, he return'd to St. <hi>Iohnston</hi>'s; there an Assembly of the Nobility was Indicted, by reason of Letters, which <hi>Robert Boyd</hi> had brought out of <hi>England</hi> to the Regent at <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin</hi>; some of them were publick, some were private; the private ones were from some Courtiers in <hi>England,</hi> containing a Relation of <hi>Howard</hi>'s Conspiracy,<note place="margin">Letters from <hi>England,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Q. of <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Howard.</hi>
               </note> which was so strong and cunningly laid, that they thought no Force or Policy could withstand it, no, not if all the remaining Power of Britain were united together: Therein his Friends exhorted him not to mingle his own flourishing Fortune with the desperate Estate of others, but to provide for himself and his Concerns, yet unimpair'd, apart.</p>
            <p>The State of Affairs in <hi>England</hi> compels me here a little to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress; because, at that time, the Good and Ill of both Kingdoms were so conjoin'd, that the one cannot well be explained without the other. The <hi>Scots,</hi> a few Years before, were delivered out of the Slavery of the <hi>French</hi> by the Assistance of the <hi>English,</hi> and thereupon they observed and subscribed to the same Rites in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in common with the <hi>English</hi>; that sudden Change of things seemed to promise an universal Quietness to all <hi>Britain,</hi> free from all domestick Tumults: But presently thereupon, the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> with the Kings of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> threatned a War, and privately managed Designs to alter things. The Pope was not wanting, by his Exhortations and Promises, to stir up their Minds already inraged; but the Kings were not sufficiently agreed amongst themselves; and their Forces were so exhausted, that they rather desired a War, than were able to make it. Besides, there was an Emulation betwixt them, one could not well bear, that the other should have so great an Accession as <hi>England,</hi> if it were conquered, to his Dominions. Moreover, some Disputes arose betwixt Them and their Subjects, which diverted their Thoughts from foreign Affairs, though the Novelty of a Woman's Reign, and she a young Woman too, without an Husband, gave Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement thereto, (especially since those who were ill affected to her, said she was born to <hi>Henry</hi> the 8<hi>th</hi> in an unlawful Marriage) and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the former Differences about the Kingdom, and about Religion, were rather stifled than extinguished; yea, the Sparks of Discontent did glow in Mens Minds, which in a short time were likely to break forth into a great Flame.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the <hi>English</hi> Papists had made many Attempts, but in vain, for they were soon quell'd; and though their Designs never succeeded, yet, Foreigners still feeding them only with bloom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Hopes, not with real Supplies, they still persisted in the same resolute Design, wanting rather a Commander for their Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, than Power or Courage to come together. The Common People of that Sect had taken a View of all the Nobility, and they found none fit enough, to whom they might commit their Lives
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:56771:345"/>
and Fortunes; many of the most stirring, had been consumed in the Civil Wars; many had past over to the other Party; some were so old, that they were unfit for publick Business; or else, the Vigor of their Minds, as well as the Strength of their Bodies, was so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitated, that they desired Peace, if it were but a tolerable one. There was only one Man, who for Courage and Power seemed fit to undertake so great a Business, and that was <hi>Thomas Howard,</hi> who though he was of himself inclinable to Quietness, yet there were some Causes which moved him to study Innovations; For his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Grand-father, though they had been highly eminent, both in War and Peace, yet, in the Storms of an unstable Court, they had been so toss'd, that their highest Glory was ballanc'd with as great Disgrace. His Father was condemn'd for Treason, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly beheaded; and Two Queens, his Kinswomen, had been also put to Death; He in those Difficulties was liberally brought up, and so preserved his Family from being quite extinguish'd, and blown up: In his very Youth, he gave a Specimen of great Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and in a few Years, by the Death of his Wives, and by new Marriages, he grew so rich, that, next to the Queen, he was the most potent of the <hi>English</hi>; for Wealth and Prudence, the rest of the Nobility yielded to him; but as for his Skill in Military Matters he had yet given no Proof of his Valor; but in the Controversies of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, he carried himself so swimmingly and ambiguously, that, tho he favoured Popery in his Heart, yet he was such a Fosterer of the contrary Party, that Many of them made sure of him, in their Thoughts, as their Own.</p>
            <p>Amids these things, the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> was overcome in Battel and fled to <hi>England,</hi> whence she wrote Letters to that Queen, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cause of her coming; she was bid by her to retire to the House of the Lord <hi>Scroop,</hi> Warden of the Marches, till she did consider of her Demands in Council;<note place="margin">Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> confined to the Lord <hi>Scroop</hi>'s House, in the North of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Scroop</hi>'s Wife was <hi>Howard</hi>'s Sister, and, by her Means, the Treaty of Marriage was secretly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun betwixt the Queen and <hi>Howard,</hi> and the Opportunity seemed to be offered by God himself, seeing <hi>Howard</hi>'s third Wife was lately dead, and he was then a Widower. The Design was concealed, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing intrusted but to a few, yet 'twas whisper'd abroad among the Common People; <hi>For narrow Spirits cannot conceal great Hopes, but Ioy gives them Vent, and so they fly abroad.</hi> The Matter was so far advanc'd, That the Fire of a Civil War seemed ready to break out, yea, some were so confident of Success, after they had consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the Strength of the Parties, that they thought <hi>Howard</hi> might easily do what he pleased, without using any Force.</p>
            <p>Things were in this Posture, when the <hi>Scots</hi> Nobles had a great Meeting at <hi>Perth,</hi> to hear the Demands of both Queen's,<note place="margin">Letters from both Queens to the <hi>Scots</hi> Nobles, read and debated.</note> both of them having wrote to them. The Queen of <hi>England</hi>'s Letters pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed one of these Three Conditions. The first was absolute, That the Queen might be restored to her Throne and Dignity, as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. But if that could not be granted, Then, that she might reign jointly with her Son, that so she might injoy Princely Honour in Letters and publick Acts; in the mean time, the Regency should be in the Hands of the present Regent, till the King came to the
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:56771:346"/>
Age of seventeen. If neither of those could be obtained, then the third Condition, was, (if the Queen could be persuaded to accept of it) That she should live privately at home, being content with those Honours, which, saving the Authority and Majesty of the King, might be granted to her. This last Request was easily assented to, if the Queen would accept it; But the other Two were perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily refused. For the better and more incorrupt Part of the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity were resolute in this, That they neither could, nor ought, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine any thing, which did diminish the King's Authority, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially being lawfully inthron'd; but the two former Heads did take off from the King's Honour, yea, it exposed his Life too, being a Pupil, unless it could be thought, that his Mother, who was known to be cruel towards her Husband, and was not well affected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward her Son neither, being exasperated by her Banishment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, should be no more kind to him, than she had been ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Also the Letters from the exil'd Queen were read, wherein she desired, That some Judges might be appointed to consider of her Marriage with <hi>Bothwel</hi>; and if 'twas found contrary to Law, that she might be divorced from him. Those Letters did highly incense the King's Party, because she wrote her self as Queen, and commanded them as Subjects: Yea, some would not have had them answered at all, because they indeavoured to abridg the King of his Power, and to instate the Rule in the sole Power of an exil'd Queen; but that Part of the Council which was for the Queen, alleged, that they wondered much, why those who had formerly, the last Year, much desired, that she would separate her Cause from <hi>Bothwel</hi>'s; now when it was freely offer'd to them, should hinder it as eagerly, (or rather more) as they had before earnestly desired it; if a Word or two in the Letters did displease them, that Fault might easily be amended; yea, some there were, who undertook (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the Matter of the Divorce might be handled in the mean time) to procure a Commission from her, in what Expressions they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves would have it: On the contrary, the adverse Party urg'd, That they saw no new Cause of such great haste, 60 days was but a lawful time for <hi>Bothwel,</hi> who was out of the Kingdom, to appear; within which time a new Commission might be sent: Neither ought that Delay to seem long, especially to her, who had past over so great a Matter in Silence, now two Years; and now also she had sent Letters, which were of themselves an Hindrance, why those who were willing to gratify her, could not comply with them; but if she desired a Divorce, 'twas easy to be obtained; let her but write to the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> desiring him to punish the Murderer of her former Husband; if he were dead, though they all were unwilling, yet she might marry where and whom she pleased; but if she refused This, then 'twas plain, she spake not sincerely and from her Heart, but made a counterfeit Pretence of Divorce, that, if she married again, she might also live in a dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and uncertain Matrimony, even with her next Husband, too: And hereof there was a shrewd Suspicion, because she desired such Judges to determine of the Divorce, who had no Power in the Case. For what Power could the Regent have over Exiles, with
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:56771:346"/>
whom he had nothing at all to do, who, unless they themselves pleased, might refuse to stand to his Judgment; or, how should they submit to anothers Judgment, who were under the Power and Dominion of other Princes; but, seeing that there seem'd to be some hidden Fraud in the Case, a Decision was not to be hastily made, but the Queen of <hi>England</hi> was to be acquainted therewith, in whose Power it was, either to promote or hinder it. Hereupon, a Young Nobleman of the Regent's Friends was sent to the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> to acquaint her with the Acts of the Convention. Some may perhaps wonder, That seeing greater Matters were trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted with less Dispute, there should be such ado made about the Divorce: But this was the cause of it; <hi>Howard</hi> had privately trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted by his Friends, concerning his marrying the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi>; and the Conspiracy was so strong both at home and abroad, That 'twas bruited among the Vulgar, the Design was, to take away both of the lawful Princes, and so to seize on the two Kingdoms, for themselves; the Place, Time, and the Whole of the Design was so ordered, that all things seem'd to be secure against any Force what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever. The Conspirators did most insist on This, To remove what might hinder the Marriage: If that were done, they seemed se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, that all the rest should fall in of it self. On the contrary, They which were for the King, made it their chief Business to cast in Rubbs to delay it; for, in the Interim, many secret Designs might in time be discovered, and the Conspiracy prevented by the Care of both Princes.</p>
            <p>In this Posture of Affairs, the Decree of the <hi>Scots</hi> Council was brought to the Queen of <hi>England</hi>; but she, alleging, she was not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with that Answer, and the Messenger did not seem to her a fit Person with whom she might confer, in so dangerous a time, and about such weighty Matters,<note place="margin">The <hi>Scots</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer Q. <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi>'s Letter.</note> desired to be better inform'd by the <hi>Scots</hi> of those Matters. Whereupon there was another Assembly of the Nobility Indicted at <hi>Sterlin,</hi> where they drew up this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
<q>That, as for the last of her Requests it might admit a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultation, in order to an Agreement; but the second was of that kind, that no Consultation at all could be admitted, on that Head, without manifest Impiety, in regard it would not only di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minish, but even extirpate, the Royal Authority: For, besides that all Partnership in Supream Magistracy is dangerous; how can Two be equally join'd in Government, whereof <hi>One</hi> was a Youth, scarce out of his Infancy; the <hi>Other</hi> a Woman in the prime of her Age, of a crafty Disposition, having past through Variety of Fortunes, who, as soon as ever she can creep into Part of the Government, will, by the Strength of that Faction, which, though she was removed by a publick Decree from the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration thereof, do yet labour to introduce her, not by Entreaties, but Threats; or else by corrupting the King's Enemies; or, lastly, by foreign Souldiers, whom she is now busy to procure, soon derive the whole Authority to her self? How will she indure, that an Infant should be equall'd with her, who would not be match'd even with her Husband? Besides, if she should marry some po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Man, (such a Matter being now on Foot) her Strength
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:56771:347"/>
would be doubled, and her Husband (as of Necessity he must) be admitted into Part of the Government; perhaps, he would not willingly suffer, that his Children should be prevented in the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession by a Son-in-Law; and then, in what a Case would the Child be? What if his Friends (as all Men are inconstant) should prefer a present Largess, before their future Hope, and so side with the strongest? What can attend the Child, being now thrust down into the second, and anon into the third Place, but utter Ruin? As for other things, they had rather leave them to her private Thoughts to meditate upon, than to make a previous Conjecture, What an angry Woman having Power in her Hands, prompted by the Imperious Counsels of her Uncles, having evidenc'd her Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty towards her Husband, being also exasperated by her Banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, would attempt against a Child, especially when stript of all Aid of Nature and Providence, and exposed as a Sacrifice to her Rage? And what Life would his Friends live, by whom she thought she was so grievously wrong'd? Besides, what would the State of Religion be, when she could vent that Rage, which in former time her Fear had concealed, especially if an Husband, of known Arrogance, should further excite her innate Cruelty? How easily might his Friends be destroyed, when the young King was slain; or else, how soon might the King be subverted, when he had lost his Friends? For these Reasons, the Queen could not be assumed into a Part of the Government, without evident De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction to the King's Affairs. Matters standing thus, there was no need to speak any thing to the first Head of her Demands.</q>

               <hi>Robert Petcarn</hi> was sent to carry this Answer into <hi>England,</hi> a Man of no less Prudence than Loyalty; and he came to that Court in the very nick of time, when the Conspiracy to kill the Queen, and to seize on both Kingdoms, was discovered and made known.

            <p>In the mean time, the Regent, in regard the Power of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse Faction did mightily increase, sends for <hi>William Maitland,</hi> who was a great Incendiary to the Conspiracy, from <hi>Perth</hi> to <hi>Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi>; he, being conscious of his Guilt, though he had experienc'd the Regent's Lenity to all his Friends, even in the greatest Offences, yet made no great haste to come; till having before sifted out, by his Friends, if any Design were form'd against him; he dealt also with the Earl of <hi>Athol,</hi> to go with him, that, if need were, he might use him as his Intercessor: As he was sitting in Council at <hi>Sterlin, Thomas Crawford,</hi> a Dependant of the Earl of <hi>Lennox</hi>'s, accused him of having an hand in the King's Murder: Whereupon, he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be kept close Prisoner in a Chamber in the Castle; whilst others were sent to apprehend <hi>Iames Balfure,</hi> who was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.

               </note> ugly Reports were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly spread abroad, That the Regent was forsaken by his intimate Friends, in such a doubtful time; and so the Castle being held against him, he was left to his Enemies Will, others being likely to follow so leading an Example very shortly; when their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor was taken away, the innocent King and his Favourers would be delivered up to those Punishments, which the cruelest Tyrants could devise; yet, the Regent was not moved by their Speeches, but, the next Day, went to the Castle, and spoke to the Governor with an unchang'd Countenance, as if he had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to him, and so returned to the Expedition, he had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken against the Robbers. In his Passage through <hi>Merch,</hi> he turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed aside, as he was wont familiarly to do, to <hi>Alexander Hume,</hi> the chief of that Clanship; there also (<hi>Hume</hi> himself being cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, and having been drawn off by great Promises to the contrary Faction) he found no benevolous Reception from <hi>Hume</hi>'s Wife, but she, being an arrogant Woman, did even mock at him to his Face; so that he departed to <hi>Teviotdale</hi>; coming thither with a small Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, and little more than his ordinary Guard, the Thieves ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring his Valour and Constancy, in that Solitude of his Friends,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:56771:348"/>
having received the Publick Faith for their Return, came in such Numbers to him, that their Multitude equalled, yea sometimes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, those of his Attendants; yet he remitted nothing of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Greatness of Mind, but answered them as became the Dignity of the Publick and his Own too; and, without doubt, he had qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eted them without Force, unless some of the Neighbour-Nobility, affected to <hi>Howard,</hi> and now ready to take Arms, had impeded his Design. His Friends came in to him at the time appointed, and then he march'd into the Territory of the Thieves, though some of the Neighbourhood indeavoured to dissuade him, by telling him of the Difficulty and Danger of the Expedition; he past with his Army through <hi>Liddisdale, Ewsdale</hi> and <hi>Eskdale,</hi> and received Hostages, not only from them, but from those beyond them; only some, who, by reason of the Greatness of their Offences, despair'd of Pardon, were outlawed by him. This Expedition procur'd him not only the Favour of the People for setling them in Security, but raised their Admiration also, That a Man forsaken by his intimate Friends, and extreamly unprovided of Necessaries, should accomplish That in a few Days, which the most potent of our Kings, in full Peace, and with great Forces, could hardly effect in a long time.</p>
            <p>Whilst these things were acting, he was made acquainted, That the <hi>English</hi> Conspiracy was detected,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Howard</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned.</note> 
               <hi>Howard</hi> committed to Prison, and the <hi>Scots</hi> Queen more strictly guarded, than before; and that <hi>Robert Petcarn</hi> had performed his Embassy with good Success, and was returned; he inform'd him, That his Proceedings were very acceptable to the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> That he had quieted the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;<note place="margin">The Regent receives an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage from the Queen of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </note> That he had imprisoned the Earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> one of the Conspirators, who was fled into <hi>Scotland</hi>; That he was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing all the rest, as Enemies; That he had sent to the Governor of <hi>Berwick,</hi> to offer him Assistance freely on all Occasions. These Courtesies she promised to remember, and that she would not be wanting to him in his Dangers, but all the Force of <hi>England</hi> should be at his Service, if need were.</p>
            <p>All the time of this Expedition, the Regent had daily Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation brought him by his faithful Friends, of a great Conspiracy against him, entred into at home. And, in all the Letters, the Governor of the Castle was still accused; whereupon, the Regent's old Courtesies and ancient Acquaintance not being yet quite can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell'd out of his Memory, he wrote to him plainly, and sent him a Copy of all his Accusations. He answered so coldly to the Crimes objected, That he became now more suspected, than before: He denied, that any Man could shew his Subscription to any Pact, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to that Conspiracy.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the Day for <hi>Maitland</hi>'s Trial drew near; for, after he was carried to the Castle, to put a bold Face on a bad Matter, he expresly desired to be brought to his Trial; for he was fully persuaded, That the Power of the Conspirators was so great in <hi>England,</hi> and also in <hi>Scotland,</hi> (of which he was one of the chief) that nothing could be orderly or lawfully determined: For in Trials of Life and Death, there use to be great Flockings toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Friends and Vassals, according to the Faction, Favour or
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:56771:348"/>
Nobility of the Accus'd, as it happen'd also, at that time. The chief of the Faction adverse to the King, <hi>viz.</hi> the Earls of <hi>Hamilton, Gordon,</hi> and <hi>Argyle,</hi> gather'd all their Force, against that Day; hoping, that if the Judgment were disturb'd by force, (as 'twas easy so to do) that they might quietly end the Conflict at one Skirmish, as being Superior in Number of Men, Opportunity of the Place, and also better provided for War. The Regent expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not a vying in Force, but in Law, and therefore had made no preparation on the other side; and so, being unwilling to put things to the utmost Hazard, before he needs must; and also, lest the Majesty of the Government might be lessened by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending with his Inferiors, he put off the Day of Trial, and so He, a Day after, about <hi>Ianuary</hi> 1<hi>st,</hi> having sent the Earl of <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland</hi> to a Prison in <hi>Lough-Levin,</hi> went to <hi>Sterlin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The adverse Faction, thus again disappointed, and perceiving the Authority and Power of the Regent to increase, and that, besides his Popularity at home, he was also supported by the <hi>English,</hi> being stirr'd up, partly by Emulation; partly by the large Promises from the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> who by Letters inform'd them, that the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spanish</hi> Aid would be presently with them, proceeded to accomplish that which they had long design'd, even the cuting off the Regent. As long as he was alive, they knew, their Projects could not take effect, and therefore they sent Messengers, thrÃ´ all Countries to the chief of their Faction, to enter into a League to that purpose. To this League, the <hi>Hamiltons</hi> subscrib'd, and Those, who either themselves, or their Children, were Prisoners in the Castle of <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh.</hi> The Governour himself was thought to be privy to it, and That which follow'd, did increase the Suspicion of him; <hi>Iames Hamilton,</hi> Son of the Arch-bishop of St. <hi>Andrew</hi>'s Sister, promised his Assistance, and indeavour'd to find a fit Time and Place to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Murder. It happen'd, that, at the same time, some hopes were given to the Regent, That <hi>Dunbarton</hi> would be surrendred upon Conditions; thither he went, but return'd without his Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand. <hi>Hamilton,</hi> being intent on all Occasions, his Ambushes not succeeding well first at <hi>Glasgow,</hi> then at <hi>Sterlin,</hi> appoints <hi>Linlithgo</hi> to be the Place fittest to execute his Purpose, because that Town was in the Clanship of the <hi>Hamiltons,</hi> and the Archbishop, his Uncle, had an house there, not far from the House where the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent us'd to lodge; in that House, being appointed for the Murder, he secretly hid himself.<note place="margin">The Regent too negligent of his fore warned Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</note> The Regent was made acquainted with the Plot, both before, and also, that very Day, before it was light; the Discoverer, for more surety, added, that the Murderer lay hid in 3 or 4 Houses from his Lodging; that, if he would send a small Party with him, he would pluck him out of his hole, and so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the whole Design, and Order of the secret Plot; yet, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent would not alter his former purpose; only he design'd to go out of the Town thrÃ´ the same Gate he enter'd in, and then turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout and proceed in his Journy; nor did he keep to this Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, neither; either because he did undervalue such Dangers, as believing his Life to be in God's Hand, to whom he was willing to render it, when 'twas call'd for; or else, because the Multitude of
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:56771:349"/>
Horse, waiting for him, stopt up the way. When he was mounted on Horseback, he thought to ride swiftly by the suspected Places, and so to avoid the Danger; but, the Multitude of the People crouding in, hinder'd his Design, so that the Murderer, out of a wooden Balcony, which he had purposely cover'd with Linen, as if 'twere for another use,<note place="margin">The Regent shot out of a Balcony, at the Instigation of the <hi>Hamiltons,</hi>
               </note> shot him with a Lead-bullet, a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Navil, and it came out almost by his Reins, and also kill'd the Horse of <hi>Iames Douglas,</hi> which was beyond him; he himself escap'd, by a back Door, or Passage, of the Garden, which he had pluck'd down on purpose; and so mounted a swift Horse, set on purpose, to carry him off, after he had committed the Fact, by <hi>Iames Hamilton,</hi> Abbat of <hi>Aber-Brothwick,</hi> and so he went to <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton,</hi> with the great Gratulation of Those, who waited to hear the Event of his audacious Enterprize; when they heard, he had ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected it, they commended him highly, and rewarded him as if now the Kingship had been actually translated into their own Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, at <hi>Linlithgo,</hi> the rest were startled at the suddenness of the Crack, and the Regent told them, he was Wounded, and, as if he had not felt it, he leap'd from his Horse, and went, on foot, to his lodging: They, which were sent for to Cure the Wound, at first said, 'Twas not Mortal; but, his Pain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing, tho his Mind was not disturb'd, he began seriously to think of Death. Those which were about him, often told him, that This was the fruit of his own Lenity, in sparing too many notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Offenders; and, amongst the rest, his own Murderer, who had been condemn'd for Treason. Whereto he return'd a mild Answer, according to his Custom, Saying, <hi>Your importunity shall never make me to Repent of my Clemency.</hi> Then, having settled his houshold-Affairs,<note place="margin">Of which Wound he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> he commended the King to the Nobles there present, and, without speaking a reproachful Word of any Man, he departed this Life before Midnight, about <hi>Ianuary</hi> 23, in the Year of our Salvation 1571. His Death was lamented by all Good Men, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally by the Commons; who lov'd him, Alive, and lamented him, Dead, as the publick Father of his Country; For, besides his many other noble Atchievements, they call'd to Mind, that, not a Year be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he had so quieted all the troublesome Parts of the Kingdom, That a Man was as safe on the Road, or at his Inn, as in his own House; and, Envy dying with him, They, who were disaffected to him, when alive, did really Praise him, when dead.

<pb n="247" facs="tcp:56771:349"/>
wanton Words; after Dinner and Supper, he always caus'd a Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter out of the Holy Bible to be read; and tho he had still a learned Man to interpret it; yet, if there were any eminent Scholars there, (as there were oft Many, and such were still well respected by him,) he would ask their Opinions; which he did, not out of a vain Ambition, but out of a desire to conform himself to the Rule thereof. He was, in a manner, too liberal; he gave to Many, and often, too; and his Alacrity in giving commended the Gift. To a great many, who were modest in receiving, he presented pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately with his own Hand. In a word, He was honest and plain-hearted to his Friends and Domesticks; for if any of them did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss, he reprov'd them more sharply, than he did Strangers. By these his Manners, Deportment and Innocency of Life, he was dear and venerable, not only to his Country-Men, but even to Foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, especially to the <hi>English,</hi> to whom, in all the vicissitudes of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, in his Life, his Virtues were more known, than to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nation.</p>

            <p>ALL that Time, which immediately followed the Death of the last Regent, although it were free from Blood-shed, yet, was embroyled with the various Attempts of the Factions. Before the Murder, the <hi>Hamiltons,</hi> in great Numbers, had met at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> under the Pretence of prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Regent, to release <hi>Iames Hamilton,</hi> the Head of their Kin or Tribe, who was yet kept Prisoner in the Castle: But, after the Murder was perpetrated, they sent some, from amongst them, to the rest of the <hi>Hamiltons,</hi> who were to dissuade the other Clans, (for so they would have made People believe) from joining with, or protecting, the publick Parricides: But, as very many suspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it was to bid them, be prepared, and ready, for all Occasions. For, the next Night after the Murder, <hi>Walter Scot,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Carr</hi> of <hi>Farnihest,</hi> entring into <hi>England,</hi> did ravage over all Places with Fire and Sword; and that, with somewhat more Cruelty than was used in former times. Neither was it so much the Desire of Prey, or Revenge, which mov'd them to this unusual Crueltie, as, that it was long before resolved by the Bishop of Saint <hi>Andrews,</hi> and the rest of the Heads of the Faction, to incense the <hi>English</hi> against the <hi>Scots</hi>: And, if they could provoke them, no other way, to take up Arms; then, by Injuries to draw them, tho unwillingly, into a War. The Governour of the Castle, although convinced by many Evidences, so that all Mens Eyes and Discourse were upon him by way of Reflection, as yet continued in his former counterfeited Loyalty to the King; 'Twas upon his account, that <hi>William Maitland</hi> was delivered out of Prison; For, when he had,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:56771:350"/>
in many Words, pleaded his Innocency before the Council, the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, then present, attesting, That it did not, with any certainty, appear to them, That he was guilty of those Crimes which were laid to his Charge, (for he was accused to have been privy to the King's and Regent's Murders, and also to be the Author of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil War that was lately raised in <hi>England</hi>) he was at last dismissed, yet so, that the Matter seem'd to be deferred till Another time, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than absolutely to be decided at That: He also, protesting his Innocency upon Oath, did promise to appear, whensoever the King's Kindred would set a Day for his Trial. Afterwards, when, upon consulting about the State of the Kingdom, they had almost agreed, That of those, whom the Queen, before she abjured her Government, had nominated Tutors to the King, he that would undertake it, provided he had not afterwards revolted to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse Faction, should have the chief Administration of Affairs. <hi>Maitland,</hi> now contriving the Disturbance of Matters, brought it so about, that it should be again signified to the absent Lords, that they might, if they pleased, be present in the Parliament of the Regent, to be assembled at a set Day, lest they might afterwards complain, That so great an Affair was hastily rash'd up in their Absence.<note place="margin">Bandyings in <hi>Scotland,</hi> upon the Regent's Murder.</note> 
               <hi>Athol,</hi> with a few others, consented; neither did the rest refuse it, more that they would take away all occasion of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction and Calumny from their Adversaries, than that they had any Hopes, that this Delay of the Parliament would bring any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to the Publick.</p>
            <p>After these Things, <hi>Thomas Randolph,</hi> the <hi>English</hi> Embassador, had Audience; for That Queen, the Regent being yet alive, had sent her Embassadors, to demand those <hi>English</hi> Exiles, who, after <hi>How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi>'s Conspiracy was detected, and he punished, for fear of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, had escaped thither: The Regent, giving these Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors Audience at <hi>Sterlin,</hi> put them off till his Arrival at <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh:</hi> and, after his Death, Things being in Confusion, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted without an Answer. But, when they conven'd about choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing a Regent, <hi>Randolph,</hi> (who, for some years, had been in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>) for that he was thought to be well read in the Affairs, and in the Men, of that Nation; and that his former Embassies had been also advantagious to both Nations, was in dear Esteem of all that were good, like himself.
<q>He, being introduc'd into the Council, having declared,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Randolph</hi>'s (Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi>'s Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,) sober Speech to the <hi>Scots.</hi>
                  </note> How great his Queen's Good-will had always been towards the <hi>Scots</hi>; That, as she had not formerly been want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them in their Disturbances, so she would not fail them now. Then he rehearsed their Incursions into <hi>England,</hi> the Slaughters, Rapines, Burnings, of late Days committed: Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, That she knew well enough, That none of these Things were acted by the Publick Council; therefore, that, at present, her Kindness and Friendship towards them, was the same it ever was: So that, although she had been grievously, and, without any Cause, provoked; yet she did not, as she might justly do, repeat Matters, nor publickly require Reparation; nor, for the Fault of a <hi>Few,</hi> seek Punishment of <hi>All</hi>: That indeed she was not ignorant, what a great Disturbance in Affairs was risen of late;
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:56771:350"/>
yet, she was not doubtful of the Good-will of honest Men to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her: That, in Favour of them, she did not only free the Publick from any Guilt, but if, by reason of domestick Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, they could not compel the Disturbers of the Peace, to resettle Matters, that she would join her Forces with theirs, that so, by common Consent, they might exact Punishment of those Viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of Leagues and Truces: But, if they were not able to do That, that then she would revenge their Injuries with her own Souldiers: That her Army should pass peaceably through the Country, without the least Damage to it; That none, that had not been guilty of the Crimes, should be concerned in the Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</q>
The remaining Heads of his Embassy contained Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ever profitable in all Legal Assemblies, but now, as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Posture of Affairs was, very necessary, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <q>That they should first of all, with all Care and Vigilance, have regard to Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which alone teaches us our Duty, both towards God, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Man: That, seeing no Common-wealth, at Discord with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in itself, can long subsist, they should bend their chiefest Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, and strive, with their utmost Force, that, at Home, <hi>among Fellow-Subjects, and Country-Men,</hi> Peace and Concord might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiously observed; and seeing God, the Framer of the Universe, had indulged Them with a Kingly Government, it was just for them to honour and obey their Kings, and to yield all Observance and Obedience to them: That Peace, Concord, and Friendship with all Men, as much as possible, are most acceptable to God, and quench, or, at least, lessen, the Thirst of shedding human Blood, (which Wickedness God especially detests): That they increase the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of All in general, and render a People more formidable to their Enemies: That Justice is the Preserver of the Publick Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, of which, the chief Part now to be made use of, is, The Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of Offenders: Seeing that Treason is most hateful to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry lawful Government, its Abettors, to what part of the Earth soever they retreated, should have neither Mercy, Favour, nor Indulgence, shewed them.</q>
Thus far <hi>Randolph</hi>; whose Advice seemed both pious, wholsom, and reasonable. But, because none was yet chosen Regent, he could not have any certain Answer, and therefore was put off till the first of <hi>May.</hi> Last of all, <hi>William</hi> and <hi>Robert Douglas,</hi> Brothers, by the Mother's Side,<note place="margin">The <hi>Douglasses</hi> Petition against the Murderers of the Regent, which occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons several De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates.</note> to the late murdered Regent, petition'd, That the villanous Death of their Brother, suffer'd upon no Private, but the Common-wealth's, Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, should be revenged. Herein, the Opinions were various, although all agreed, That the Murderers were to be punished: Some thought fit, That a Day should be set for those, suspected of the Murder, to appear, (and many of their Names were given in): Others were of Opinion, That Court-Days were not to be waited for against those, who were now in Arms, to maintain, by Force, that Fact, which they had wickedly committed: And, that it was fit, not only to take up Arms forthwith against them, but likewise against all those, who were sentenced by the last Parliament. To this Opinion the <note n="*" place="margin">Or, Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners.</note> Knights of Shires were most inclined, yet they could not obtain their Purpose, by the dissuasion chiefly of <hi>Athol,</hi>
               <pb n="250" facs="tcp:56771:351"/>
who said, They ought to expect a more numerous Assembly of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; and of <hi>Morton,</hi> who thought, That, should they join more Crimes together, the Revenge of the Regent's Death would miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and a Civil War break out; because all those, who dreaded the Peace, would join with the Murderers. Therefore, that their Crimes should be separated, and Affairs, if possible, acted by Law, and nothing innovated, before the first of <hi>May,</hi> (which was the Day appointed for their Meeting.) And so that Session was dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; most part of the People condemning this Delay of the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, because (said they) all things are acted, as the King's Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies please, who had occasion'd these Delays purposely, that, in length of Time, the <hi>Odium</hi> of the Murder might diminish, and the opposite Faction, that while, gain Strength. This Opinion of the Peoples was confirmed, not only by some preceding Accidents, but also by very many, which followed: For presently, when the Regent's Murder was yet hardly divulged, <hi>Iames Hamilton,</hi> upon a Mortgage of his Lands, procures Mony of <hi>Iohn Somerval,</hi> of <note n="*" place="margin">A Barony on the East-side of <hi>Clyde.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Camnethen,</hi> which, together with another Sum, borrowed of his Friends, he sent to his Complices to hire Souldiers with, having warned them before, to be ready for all Essays, because of the sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Alteration which had happen'd, upon their having rid them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves of their capital Enemy. And after that, the Queen's Party ceased not to have Meetings, in many and distant Places. About the 15<hi>th</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> almost all the Chiefs of the Rebellious Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on met together at <hi>Glasgow</hi>; whence <hi>Argyle</hi> and <hi>Boyd</hi> wrote to <hi>Morton,</hi> That they, because, as yet, they knew not Who were the Actors in, or privy to, the Regent's Murder, would willingly communicate their Counsel with the rest of the Nobility, as well for the Discovery, as Punishment, of that Murder; but, that they would not come to <hi>Edinburgh</hi>; but if the King's Party would be persuaded to meet them at <hi>Linlithgo,</hi> at <hi>Falkirk,</hi> or at <hi>Sterlin,</hi> they would, without Delay, come thither. This Business, being communicated to <hi>Maitland</hi> by <hi>Morton,</hi> (for so the Letter requested) came to nothing. About the same time, <hi>Thomas Car</hi> wrote to his Father-in-Law, the Governour of the Castle, from <hi>Linlithgo,</hi> That, if the Queen of <hi>England</hi> would be prevailed withal, to lay by her Resentment of the late Incursions, he would endeavour, that, for the future, the Borders should be quieted, and kept in due Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; but that, if she should refuse these Offers, he would continue in the Design he had begun; not doubting, but that his honest Country-men, who yet retained their Fealty to their Queen, would join with him, and that the <hi>French</hi> Auxiliaries would speedily come, also.</p>
            <p>About the third of <hi>March,</hi> the <hi>Hamiltons,</hi> with <hi>Argyle</hi> and <hi>Boyd,</hi> met at <hi>Linlithgo</hi>; but the killing of one common Souldier, beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a Tumult, disturbed all their Counsels; which made the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of St. <hi>Andrews</hi> carry home the <hi>Hamiltons</hi> with him. The rest of the Rebels, chiefly <hi>Huntly, Athol, Crawford, Ogilby</hi>; also, of those on this side <hi>Forth, Hume, Seton</hi> and <hi>Maitland,</hi> met at <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinburgh</hi>; in which City <hi>Morton</hi> was, accompanied but with few, till the Earls of <hi>Glencarn</hi> and <hi>Marr,</hi> with their Followers, came to

him. About the fourth of <hi>March,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A Convention of the Nobles, with various Opinions about choosing a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent;</note> the Heads of the Factions met to consult about the Main, but this Consultation went but slowly on, by reason of <hi>Argyle</hi>'s Abs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>nce, whose Power and Authority was then very great. <hi>Huntly</hi> goes to him, undertaking to persuade him to join with the rest of the Faction, but returns without Success, by the Treachery of <hi>Maitland,</hi> (as most Men thought) who desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to drill on Affairs, that, amidst the Confusions of the Kingdom, he might have the fitter Opportunity for Innovations. <hi>Argyle</hi> also, in all his Undertakings, had another Impediment, which hindred, That his Power was not now so great, as it was found to be former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which was, That, though he himself was a most eager Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of the Queen's Cause, yet his Friends and Clients, no, nor his very Brother, could not be prevailed with to follow him against the King. The Night following, a sudden Terror, without any apparent Cause, did so seize upon all the Factious, that they watch'd in their Armour, till it was Day-light; and, in the Morning, they as fearfully departed from <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> All the Time of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, the chief Thing controverted, was, By what Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity the <hi>Scots</hi> might, at that time, choose a Regent? Some, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Queen's Letters-Patents, by which she had designed Eight of the Nobility, that, out of them, one, or more, as should be thought fit, might be nominated as Tutors to her Son, would have <hi>one</hi> of that number placed at the Helm. Others were of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, That those Letters were now useless, since that a Regent was already chosen, according to their Appointment; and that all Thoughts of them should be laid aside, as being not made to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in Force, but for that one Juncture of Time, only. Some there were, who would have the whole Affair deferred, until the General Convention of the Nobility, but These were mostly of <hi>Maitland</hi>'s Faction, which expected, That a great Distraction in Affairs would follow, which, in a great Multitude, without a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, is easily rais'd, but not so easily laid. The Third Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on condemned both the Others: The First, for that now there ought less Account to be made of the Queen's Letters-Patent, since (if the Matter of Law were considered) they were, from their beginning, of little or no force: The Other,<note place="margin">But is dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, <hi>re infecta.</hi>
               </note> for that a Prorogation would both draw much Danger along with it, &amp; also a greater Delay, than the present Condition of Affairs could well permit; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they would have all those to meet, who, at first, had advised the King to enter upon the Government, and had constantly adhered to him, ever since: These, according to the sense of this Party, were to take the best Care they could for the Publick-Weal, and speedily appoint such a Regent, who was both able and willing to provide for the Safety of King and Kingdom, both. But this Opinion was rejected also, and so, before any thing was concluded upon, the Convention was broke up.</p>
            <p>So many Meetings having been tried in vain, the Rebels again return to the old Seminary of the <hi>English</hi> War, thereby to draw the Populacy to their Faction; and send out the same Captains of the Freebooters, which were sent before, who left nothing of Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty uncommitted, even to the utmost extremity. And, in the
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:56771:352"/>
mean time, the Heads of their Faction bespatter the Queen of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> with all manner of Reproaches: And also, they malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously accuse the <hi>Scotish</hi> Nobles, as Pensioners to the <hi>English,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly giving out, in a way of Threatning, That if their Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries did call in the <hi>English</hi> to their Aid, they would have recourse to the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spanish</hi> Succours. About this time, Mr. <hi>Le Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rac,</hi> one of the King of <hi>France</hi>'s Bed-Chamber-Men, came from <hi>France</hi> to <hi>Dumbritton,</hi> who, with his large Promises, somewhat raised up their Courages. Hereupon, the <hi>Hamiltons</hi> appointed a Meeting of their People, to be held the 9<hi>th</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> at <hi>Linlith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go</hi>; Where, when the Queen's Faction was gathered together in great Numbers, They began openly to treat of That, which they had long before meditated in their private Cabals, That, if a War against the <hi>English</hi> could be made, thereby private Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Actions, either about the King's or Regent's Murder, in that universal Disturbance of Affairs, would either grow out of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, or, at least, the Resentment of them much abate. These Things having been transacted at <hi>Linlithgo,</hi> by the Associates of the Conspiracy only, who having not yet plainly unmasked their Intentions,<note place="margin">The <hi>Hamiltons,</hi> and others of the Queen's Party, meet at <hi>Edinburgh.</hi>
               </note> that they might have more Shew of Authority, they determine to meet at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> on the 11<hi>th</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, besides the other Conveniencies which the Place would afford them, draw the Citizens, of whom they always made great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, either way, to their Party. This seemed no hard Matter, since they had already gained <hi>William Kircady,</hi> the Governour both of the City and Castle, to their Side: But, because they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, that Watch and Ward was kept there, and that the Common People were more inclined to their Adversaries, they thought fit to send to the Citizens, first, to know, Whether or no it was their Pleasure, they should meet there? The Citizens Answer was, That they would exclude no Person, that was desirous of the Publick Peace, and obedient to the King; but that they would admit nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>English</hi> Exiles, nor the <hi>Hamiltons,</hi> into their City, lest they should either highly displease the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> in whose Kingdom they had great Traffick, or seem to join in Counsel with those that were guilty of that horrid Murder; nor likewise, would they endure the Proposal of any New Edicts, which might tend to the lessening of the Regal Authority; or, that their Souldiery should be forc'd (as the Custom was) to run to their Arms by sound of Drum. Upon these Conditions, how hard soever they seemed, they not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding came into the City, in hopes, by degrees, to gain upon the unwary Multitude, and, by soothing them up with fair Speeches,<note place="margin">The <hi>Edinburgh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> much court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to side with them, but in vain.</note> at last, to bring them all to their beck; but, for all this, they could not prevail with the Citizens to deliver up their Keys to them, or to cease their usual Watch, though <hi>Kircady,</hi> Governour of the Castle and City, join'd his utmost Endeavours with them, that they should do so.</p>
            <p>All that time, they visited <hi>Maitland</hi> (who (if he did not dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble deeply,) was troubled with the Gout) every day, and in such Numbers, that his House was commonly named a School, and he a Schoolmaster: <hi>Athol,</hi> the whilst, incessantly passing from one
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:56771:352"/>
Place to another, that he might draw those of the contrary Faction to this Meeting at <hi>Edinburgh</hi>; but they all, with one accord, refused to come before <hi>May</hi> 1. (which was the Day generally agreed on by all) unless they were satisfied of the necessity of coming, before; if any thing of moment had happen'd, which would admit of no Delay, they would have them acquaint the Earl of <hi>Morton</hi> with it, who was at his House but four Miles off, and he would tell the rest of it. <hi>Athol,</hi> at last, appoints a Day, on which, some of either Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction should meet at <hi>Morton</hi>-Hall, which is in <hi>Dalkeith</hi>; but this Place did not please the Queen's Faction, not that they dreaded any Treachery, but out of a Conceit, That it would be an undervalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Authority, if they should come to <hi>Morton,</hi> rather than He come to Them. Therefore, after many Attempts, and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing proceeded to their Satisfaction, they were forc'd to break up the Meeting; for seeing, that, being desirous to rid the City of their Adversaries, they could not prevail with the Citizens to join with them; in order to it, they resolved to call in a greater Number of their Friends dwelling nearest, that, in spite of the Inhabitants, they might get all Things into their own Power. The Governour of the Castle facilitated This very much, who set at Liberty those Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons whom he had in Custody, (and they were well nigh All the Heads of the Queen's Faction.) But a sudden Rumour, That the <hi>English</hi> Army was come to <hi>Berwick,</hi> startled all their Resolutions: <hi>Alexander Hume,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Maxwel,</hi> lately let out of Prison, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Publick Authority, betook themselves to their own Homes, to look to their own Concerns: And <hi>Hume</hi> had part of the Mony (gathered for raising of Souldiers) given him, to fortify his own Castle, <hi>Hume. Thomas Carr,</hi> and <hi>Walter Scot,</hi> who, by the Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation chiefly of the Archbishop of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> had made Incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions into <hi>England,</hi> foreseeing, That, from this beginning, a War would be kindled between the Two Kingdoms, being deserted by their Neighbours, and doubtful of their own Strength, send to the Heads of their Faction for Aid; or, if that could not be done, that, at least, they would come as far as <hi>Lauder,</hi> (a neighbouring Town), and from thence make a Shew of War. Therefore, when they could neither obtain their Request in This, nor yet the least Portion of their common Stock, for the Publick Advantage; and, being highly incensed to be thus betrayed and forsaken by those very Men, that had put them upon the War, every one of them betakes himself to take care for his own Safety, their Hopes, for the time to come, being all blasted: So that, so many cross Accidents, unexpectedly falling out at one and the same time, quite and clean disturbed all their Plots and Machinations;<note place="margin">An <hi>English</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my coming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Scotland,</hi> puts the Queen's Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to a stand.</note> but the sudden Approach of the <hi>English</hi> Army, was It, which most surprized them; and therefore, to see if they could put a stop to it, they make use of two Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies into <hi>England</hi>; the One to <hi>Thomas,</hi> Earl of <hi>Sussex,</hi> to desire a Truce, till such time, as they had laid open the State of their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs to the Queen of <hi>England</hi>: The Other Embassador carried Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to the Queen, containing many things, as well for their own Cause, as against the King's Faction; especially, by making their Brags of greater Forces than they had in reality, and vilifying
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:56771:353"/>
Those of their Adversaries, thereby covertly threatning the <hi>English</hi> with a War: For <hi>Maitland</hi> had made them believe, That that Queen, a Woman naturally timorous, would do any thing rather than be brought to a War, at a time when both the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniard</hi> were, for many Reasons, at Emmity with her, and her own Affairs at home were scarce setled; The Rebels desired, that, by the <hi>English</hi> Queens Arbitrement, all the Ordinances of the last Two Years should be called in, although many amongst them had sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed them; and that all things, being, as it were, acted <hi>de novo,</hi> a new Ordinance should, by a general Consent, be made: And that they might better set forth the Potency of their Faction, their Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter had all the great Mens Names, that were of their Party, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed to It; and also, for the greater Ostentation of their Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, they set to it the Names of Many as well of the adverse Faction,<note place="margin">The Queen's Party send Embassadors into <hi>England.</hi>
               </note> as of those that were Neuters; in Hopes, that the <hi>English</hi> (by Reason of the great Distance, and their Ignorance of things done so far off; and that their Letters to the Queen, would be exposed to the View but of few Persons) would hardly be able to detect their Fraud.</p>
            <p>About that time, an Accident happened, as they thought, very advantagious to their Affairs, as hoping, that it would both make the <hi>English</hi> less forward, and also terrify the <hi>Scotch</hi> Populacie; <hi>viz.</hi> the Arrival of a certain <hi>French</hi>-Man,<note place="margin">St. <hi>Lewis</hi> de <hi>Galais,</hi> Ld. of <hi>Lansach</hi> in <hi>France.</hi>
               </note> however of a mean Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who, as being <hi>Lansack</hi>'s Menial Servant, was, for his Master's sake, entertained at that Court. This Man brought a great many Letters, all of the same Purport, from the <hi>French</hi> King, not only to the Heads of the Queen's Faction,<note place="margin">An Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor from <hi>France</hi> to the Queen's Party.</note> but likewise to Many, who had not declared themselves for either Faction, in which great Thanks were given to every one of them, for their having hitherto taken the Queen's Part; the King desiring them constantly to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in so doing, and he would send them Aid, even greater than they had desired of him, as soon as ever he could do it with Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencie. He also that brought the Letters, adds, as from himself,
<q>That all things were now at quiet in <hi>France, Iaspar Colligny</hi> and the other Rebels being reduced to such Terms, as to promise to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from <hi>France,</hi> lest their Presence should be a Hindrance to the Publick Peace: And that he doubted not, but that the Souldiers which were to be sent to assist them, would all be raised, before his Return.</q>
The Wiser sort, although they knew, that these things were mostly nothing but vain Reports, yet permitted the common Sort to be deluded by them. When therefore the Minds of many People became, by these Means, to be erected, their Joy was lessen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the unsuccessful Return of their Embassadors: For <hi>Sussex</hi> could not, by any Conditions they could offer him, be induced, to think it to be for the <hi>English</hi> Interest, either to maintain an Army only to idle their Time away in Truces; or, wholly to desist from the War. And the Queen having, after Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusal, caused their Letter to be sealed up again, and sent back to the King's Party in <hi>Scotland</hi>;<note place="margin">Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> rejects the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassy of the Queen's Party in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </note> which was done, that the Expectation of an Answer from her should cause Delay in Affairs, and thereby their Fraud be easily found out. And, for that their Letter contained
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:56771:353"/>
nothing but vain Boasting, and that the <hi>English</hi> were not ignorant of any thing that had been transacted in <hi>Scotland,</hi> their Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, grievously abashed with Reproaches, were forced to return. Therefore being disappointed of that Hope, and affrightned by the so sudden drawing near of the <hi>English</hi> Army to their very Borders, and those who were to have assisted them, being gone to defend their own Homes; having also small Confidence in the Citizens, and knowing, that their Enemies would come to <hi>Edinburgh</hi> on the first of <hi>May:</hi> They therefore departed thence, and went to <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lithgo,</hi> holding that Place to be very commodious for the sending for those of their Party from the most distant Places of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; as also for the hindring the Journies of the others that were going to the Assembly; and for bringing about of those other things, which were lately discussed at their Consultations. From this Place, the <hi>Hamiltons,</hi> with their Friends and Vassals, made the whole Road leading to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> very unsafe for Passengers; and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that <hi>Iohn Erskin,</hi> Earl of <hi>Marr,</hi> was to come that Way, they placed themselves on the Neighbouring Hills to hinder his Journy; but he, knowing how the Way was beset, passed the River, about two Miles above; and so <hi>April</hi> 29, in the Evening, he came safe to <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> After that Day, the King's Party abode at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and the Queen's at <hi>Linlithgo,</hi> mutually charging and criminating one another, as the Causes and Rise of these Civil Combustions.<note place="margin">The Queen's Party at <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lithgo,</hi> the King's at <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh.</hi>
               </note> But those at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> informed their Contrariants, That they were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to come to an easy Agreement upon other Heads, as, that if they had done any Man wrong, they would give him just Satisfaction, as indifferent Arbitrators should award; provided always, That this King's Authority might be secured, and that both Parties might join to revenge the Murder of the last King, and of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent. To this Proposal, they at <hi>Linlithgo</hi> gave no satisfactory An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, but, instead thereof, made an Edict, That all Subjects should obey the Queen's Commissioners; and the three Earls, of <hi>Arran, Argyle</hi> and <hi>Huntly,</hi> Indicted an Assembly to be held at <hi>Linlithgo, August</hi> 3. Whereupon the other Party sent <hi>Robert Petcarn</hi> their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador to the Queen of <hi>England,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Petcarn,</hi> an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador from the Royalists in <hi>Scotland</hi> to Q, <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>

            <p>Thus, whilst each Party was crossing one another's Design, the <hi>English</hi> enter <hi>Teviotdale,</hi> and spoil the Towns and Villages belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Families of the <hi>Cars,</hi> and of the <hi>Scots,</hi> (who had violated the Peace, by making Excursions into <hi>England,</hi> and giving Harbour to such <hi>English</hi> Fugitives, as fled to them for Shelter) wasting and burning their Country.

It was valiantly defended by the Garison within, and the <hi>English,</hi> the next day after, were about to raise the Siege; when, lo! Letters were brought to the Garison-Souldiers, written a while before by <hi>Alexander,</hi> Owner of the

Castle, which disturbed all their Measures. For therein he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to obey the Orders of <hi>William Drury,</hi> an <hi>English</hi> Knight, and to do what he commanded them, without any Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute. <hi>Drury</hi> acquainted <hi>Sussex</hi> herewith, whereupon the Castle was surrendred and plundered, and <hi>Sussex</hi> placing a Garison of <hi>English</hi> therein, with a great Booty, returned to <hi>Berwick.</hi> Thus <hi>Hume,</hi> who was so far from being afraid of the <hi>English,</hi> that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he thought them his very Friends, as knowing that <hi>Drury</hi> and <hi>Sussex</hi> Both did secretly favour <hi>Howard</hi>'s Affairs, did almost undo himself by his own Credulity; for, at last, being forsaken of all his Friends and Kindred, who were mostly Royalists, he came with One or Two in his Company to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and shut up himself, as a Recluse, in the Castle there.</p>

They knew, that it was kept but by a few raw Souldiers; that the Governor was absent; and that it was unprovided of Necessaries, so that they thought to surprize it by their sudden Approach; for they flew into the Town in such Haste, that they shut out a good part of the Garison-Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers from entring the Castle; but, being disappointed of their Hope, they began to batter and storm violently, and were as valiantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsed, for the Garison Souldiers (which were but 24) did so warmly receive them for several Days, that they slew more of the Assailants, than they themselves were; and the rest they beat off, sorely wounded: of their Own, they lost but one Man, and none of the rest received so much as a Wound.

Upon these Conditions, a Conference was promised, and having oblig'd her self in such Circumstances, she could not join with them in their Design in making a new Regent, lest she might seem to condemn their Queen, without hearing Her; But in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, she said, That she had a great Affection for them, and their Affairs. In the mean time, She desir'd, that they would abstain from Arms, and from making a Regent, and she would take care,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:56771:355"/>
that such a small delay should be no damage to them.</q>
This An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, being reported to the <hi>Scots,</hi> did variously affect them. On the one hand, the Necessity of the time requir'd them to steer their Counsels, so as they might be pleasing to the Queen of <hi>England</hi>; And on the other, they knew of what Concernment it was to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, That one chief Magistrate should be set up, to whom all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints might be made; and, for want of creating One some Months already past, the Enemy had improv'd the delay to gather Forces, to make new Courts of Justice, daily to set forth new Edicts, and to usurp all the Offices of a King. On the other side, the Royalists were dejected, and a Multitude, without one certain Person, whom to obey, could not be long kept in Obedience. After the Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors Return, News came, That there was a new Insurrection in <hi>England,</hi> and that, in <hi>London,</hi> the Popes Bull was fastned on the Church Doors, to exhort the <hi>English,</hi> partly to cast off the unjust Yoke of the Queen's Government, and partly, to return to the Popish Religion; and it was thought, that the Hand of the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> was in all This.</p>
            <p>These things, tho kept private, yet came to be known by Letters from the Earl of <hi>Sussex</hi>; and also, the same <hi>Thomas Randolph</hi> had, in presence, confirm'd it, yet they could hardly be restrain'd from chusing a Regent. But at last, a middle Way prevail'd, That they might have an appearance of a chief Magistrate, to set up an Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or Regent, or Deputy-Governour, to continue till the 12<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Iuly,</hi> in which time, they might be further inform'd of the Queen of <hi>England's</hi> Mind; they judg'd, That she was not averse from their Undertaking, especially upon This ground, That she had put it into the Articles of Capitulation, That the Rebels should give up all the exil'd <hi>English</hi>: If that were done, they might easily understand, that the Spirits of all the Papists about <hi>England</hi> were alienated from the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi>: If it were denied, then the Conference, or Treaty, would break off, and the Suspicions, which made the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalty averse, would daily increase. For, they saw, that other things would not easily be agreed upon, when a greater Danger was imminent over the <hi>English,</hi> than the <hi>Scots,</hi> upon the Deliverance of their Queen; and if other things were accorded, yet the Queen of <hi>England</hi> would never let her go, without giving Hostages; neither was she able to give any such, who could make a sufficient War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty. These Considerations gave them some Encouragement, so that they proceeded to create <hi>Matthew Stuart,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Matthew Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>art,</hi> Earl of <hi>Len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nox,</hi> created <hi>Vice-Roy</hi>; and then, Regent.</note> Earl of <hi>Lennox,</hi> the King's Grandfather, to be Vice-Gerent, for the time.</p>
            <p>Whilst this new Vice-Roy, by the advice of his Council, was busied in rectifying things, which had been disorder'd in the late Tumults; Letters came opportunely from the Queen of <hi>England, Iuly</hi> the 10<hi>th,</hi> wherein she spake much of her Affection to the King and Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and freely offer'd them her Assistance; withal, she deprecated the naming of a Regent, which was a Title invidious of it self, and of no good Example to them; only, if they ask'd her Advice, she thought, none was to be preferr'd to that high Office, before the King's Grandfather; none being of greater Faithfulness to the King, yet a Pupil; and, who now for the same
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:56771:355"/>
Reasons was made Deputy-Governour of the Kingdom. These Letters incourag'd them, by the joint Suffrages of all the Estates, of a Vice-Roy to make him Regent. Assoon as ever he was created Regent, and had taken an Oath (according to Custom) to observe the Laws and Customs of his Country; First of all, he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that All, which were able to bear Arms, should appear at <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lithgo, August</hi> the 2<hi>d,</hi> to hinder the Convention, which the Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious had there Indicted in the Name of the Queen; then, he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self summon'd a Parliament, in the Name of the King, to be held the 10<hi>th</hi> day of <hi>October</hi>; he also sent to the Governour of the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> (who, as yet, pretended great Friendship to the King's Party, tho his Words and Actions did very much disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree) to send him some Brass-Guns, Carriages, and other <hi>Apparatus</hi> for the managing of them; This he did, rather to try them, than in hopes to obtain his desires. He promis'd very fair at first, but when the Day was coming on, that the Parliament was to Meet, when he was desir'd to perform his Promise, he peremptorily refus'd, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leging, That his Service should be always ready to make up an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement between, but not to shed the Blood of, his Country-Men. Nevertheless, the Regent came at the Day appointed to <hi>Linlithgo</hi> with 5000 arm'd Men in his Company; but hearing, that the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my did not stir, only that <hi>Huntly</hi> had placed 160 Souldiers at <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin,</hi> and had sent out an Order, commanding the <hi>Brechinians,</hi>

Whereupon, he commanded <hi>Patrick Lindsy,</hi> and <hi>William Ruven,</hi> chief Officers, and <hi>Iames Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liburton,</hi> Governour of <hi>Dundee,</hi> to take what Souldiers they could raise at <hi>Dundee,</hi> and St. <hi>Iohnstons,</hi> and to make haste thither to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the News of their coming: They made all the speed that ever they were able, the next Night horsing their Foot for greater Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition; yet, as they drew near the Place, they march'd slowly, that they might get some Refreshment, before they charg'd the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: so that, the Alarum was taken at <hi>Brechin,</hi> that the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my was a coming; whereupon <hi>Ogilby</hi> and <hi>Balfure,</hi> who chanc'd to be there, got the Souldiers presently together; and incouraging them, as well as they could for the time, They told them, that They and <hi>Huntly</hi> would return again in 3 Days; and so they got an Horseback, and made haste away, over the Mountains; The Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, that were left, catch'd up what was next at hand, and about 20 of them got to the Tower of a Church, that was near: The rest fled into the House of the Earl of <hi>Marr,</hi> which was seated on a Hill near thereto, it was like a Castle, and commanded the Town.
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:56771:356"/>
               <hi>Iames Douglas,</hi> Earl of <hi>Morton,</hi> with 800 Horse, went a further March about, and came not in, till the Day after; The Regent sent home the <hi>Lennoxians</hi> and the <hi>Renfroans,</hi> to guard their own Country, if <hi>Argyle</hi> should attempt any thing against it; But he himself, in 3 Days, overtook those, whom he had sent before to <hi>Brechin.</hi> At the noise of his coming, the neighbour Nobility came in, so that now he muster'd 7000 Men, effective: Whereupon they, who were in the Church Tower, presently surrendred them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. The rest, having stoutly defended themselves for a few Days, Killing and Wounding some, who were unwary in their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, at last hearing, That Brass-Guns were planted against them,<note place="margin">Which is taken by the Regent.</note> and that <hi>Huntly</hi> had forsaken them, surrendred also at Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to the Regent. He hang'd up 30 of the obstinatest of them, many of them, having been taken and releas'd before; the rest, being very feeble, he dismist. <hi>Huntly</hi> was then about 20 Miles off, endeavouring to gather more Force, but in vain, (for most Men, when they had free liberty to declare themselves, did abhor so foul a Cause); Whereupon he was forc'd, in fear, to provide for his Safety, and with a small Party retired into the remote Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</p>
            <p>Whereupon, the Regent return'd to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> to be present at the Parliament there Summon'd; and, by the advice thereof, to set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle the present Disturbances. The Rebels perceiving, that, by the Agreement of all the Estates, there was no Hope left them; especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly They, who were Guilty of the King's Murder, and of the Death of the Regent, dealt with the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> that, because she had promis'd the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spanish</hi> Embassadors,<note place="margin">Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> made Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biter betwixt both Parties in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </note> that she would hear both Parties, and compose Things, if she could, that therefore no new Decree should be made, in the mean time. This Delay being obtain'd, (for nothing was done, in that Assembly, only the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of the Regent was confirm'd) the Rebels never ceas'd to solicite the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniard,</hi> to send Aid into <hi>Britain,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store the Queen; and because they affirm'd, That the Restitution of the Popes, or the old, Religion, depended on Her, therefore they made means to the Pope also, that, tho he were far remote, yet he might help them with Mony. Whereupon he sent an Agent into <hi>Scotland,</hi> to enquire into the present State of things there, who giving him an Account, that the <hi>Popish</hi> Party there was very weak; and that all the Rebels, neither, were not unanimous in the restoring of Popery, he refus'd to intermeddle in the Business; but, in the mean time, he endeavour'd to raise up some Commotion in <hi>England,</hi> by his Execrations and Curses hung upon Church doors by Night; by his Indulgences; and by his promise of Indemnity for what was past; for there, he thought, his Faction was the strongest. The Regent, having appointed the Parliament to be held the 25<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> (for, within that time, he hoped to satisfy all foreign Embassadors) to compose things Legally and Judicially, as well as he could, return'd to <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> The Rebels, having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new'd the Truce, by means of the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> till the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors of both Parties had been heard, before her; yet, contrary to the Peace desir'd by themselves, were very busy to attempt Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations,

encourag'd (as 'tis thought) by the favour of the Earl of <hi>Sussex,</hi> who then commanded the Army of the <hi>English</hi> in <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland.</hi> For he, either not altogether despairing of the Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi>; or else, induc'd by the Promises of the Exiled Queen, of whose Return he had some Hopes, was somewhat inclinable to the Rebels; which the <hi>Scots</hi> taking notice of, were more sparing in communicating Counsels with him. The Winter being thus spent in the reviving of the Truce; the Parliament Summon'd on the 25<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> was deferr'd till <hi>May.</hi> In the mean time, the <hi>Hamiltons,</hi> having, in vain, suborn'd many Men to kill the Regent, at last seiz'd upon the Tower of <hi>Pasley,</hi> driving out the Garison-Souldiers therein, thinking they might do such a thing with Impunity, whilst Mens Minds were imploy'd in greater Matters. The Regent appointed the Earl of <hi>Morton, Robert Pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carn,</hi> and <hi>Iames Macgil,</hi> his Embassadors to <hi>England,</hi> to reason the Matter with the Embassadors of other Princes, and sent them away <hi>February</hi> the 5<hi>th,</hi> and he himself march'd to <hi>Pasley,</hi>

Afterwards, when <hi>Gilbert Kennedy</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested the Royalists with his plundering Incursions in <hi>Carrick,</hi> he went to <hi>Aire</hi>; and assoon as <hi>Kennedy</hi> heard of the Approach of a few Troops, being also afraid of his Clanships, who had been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways Loyal to the King and his Party, he gave in his only Brother for an Hostage, and appointed a Day to come to <hi>Sterlin,</hi> and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe to the Capitulation, agreed on. <hi>Hugh Montgomery,</hi> Earl of <hi>Eglington,</hi> and <hi>Robert Boyd,</hi> follow'd his Example; and surrendring themselves to the Regent, were by him receiv'd into Favour.

When his Speech was told to the Regent, though the thing it self, being great, had somewhat excited their Minds, and made them willing enough to have it done, yet the Author (though they judg'd him faithful) seem'd not a fit Instrument to effect so great a Matter: Whereupon <hi>Thomas Crawford,</hi> a valiant Man, and a good Souldier, was made acquainted with the Project, and 'twas agreed betwixt them, rather to try the Hazard of so great and casual a Proffer, than slothfully to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect such an Opportunity. Whereupon, a few Days were allotted to provide Ladders, and other Necessaries, and the Plot was to be executed on the first of <hi>April,</hi> for then the Truce granted to the Rebels, by the Mediation of the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. In the mean time, no Talk at all was to be made about it.</p>
            <p>Before I declare the Event of this Piece of Service, give me leave to tell you the Nature and Situation of the Castle of <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barton.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Scituation of the Castle, and Town, of <hi>Dunbarton,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally by our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, who was born there.</note> From the Confluence of the Rivers <hi>Clyde</hi> and <hi>Levin,</hi> there is a plain Champaign of about a Mile, extended to the Foot of the adjoining Mountains; and in the very <hi>Angle,</hi> where the two Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers meet, there stands a Rock with Two Cops or Heads. The one Branch, or Cop, which is the highest, respects the West; and in the very Top of it there is a Watch-Tower, from whence there is a large Prospect to all Parts thereabouts. The other Cop is lower, and looks towards the East; between the two Cops, that Side that turns towards the North and the Fields, hath Stairs ascending ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely by the Rock, cut out by Mens Hands, where hardly a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Man can go up at once. For the Rock is very hard, and scarce malleable by any Iron-Tool; but if any Part of it be broken off by Force, or falls down of it self, it emits a Smell far and near, like <hi>Sulphur.</hi> In the upper Part of the Castle, there is an huge Stony Rock, of the Nature of a Load-stone, but so closely cemented, and fastned to the rest of the Rock, that no Joint at all, or Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, doth appear; Where the River <hi>Clyde</hi> runs by to the South, the Rock (naturally steep in other Parts,) is somewhat bending; and stretching out its Arms on both Sides, takes in some firm Land, which is so inclosed, partly by the Nature of the Place, and partly by human Industry, that, in the overthwart or transverse Sides thereof, it affords Place for many Houses; and also, in the River, a Road for Ships, very safe for the Inhabitants, by playing Brass-Guns from thence; but unsafe for an Enemy; and small Boats therein may come up, almost to the very Castle Gate. The mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle Part of the Rock, by which you go up, being full of Buildings, makes, as it were, another Castle, distinct and secluded from the higher one: Besides the Natural Fortification of the Rock, the two Rivers, <hi>Levin</hi> to the West, and <hi>Clyde</hi> to the South, make a kind of Graff and Trench about it; on the East Side, when the Tide is in, the Sea washes the very Foot of the Rock; when 'tis
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:56771:357"/>
out, that Place is not sandy (as usually Shores are) but muddy; the fat Soil being dissolv'd into Dirt. This Strand is also intercepted and cut by many Torrents of Water, which tumble down from the Mountain, adjacent. The other side turns towards a plain Field, full of Grass. The Castle hath three Fountains in it, always running; besides Springs of fresh Water in many other Places. The ancient <hi>Britains,</hi> as <hi>Bede</hi> says, call'd the Place <hi>Alcuith</hi>; but the <hi>Scots,</hi> which were heretofore sever'd from the <hi>Britains</hi> by the River <hi>Levin,</hi> because that Fort was built on the Borders of the <hi>Britains,</hi> call'd it <hi>Dumbritton,</hi> now <hi>Dunbarton.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dumbritton,</hi> why so called.</note> There is a little Town hard by, of the same Name, upon the Bank of the River of <hi>Levin,</hi> about a Mile distant from the meeting of the Rivers.</p>
            <p>This Castle was accounted impregnable, and, in all foreign and civil Wars, was of great Advantage to them that held it, and as prejudicial to their Enemy. At that time, <hi>Iohn Flemming</hi> was Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of it, by Commission from the banish'd Queen; he, though he consented not to the King's Murder; yet, having not a Force sufficient to defend himself against the Royalists, sided with the Parricides, and for four Years last past,<note place="margin">

               </note> had kept up the Garison at the Charge of the King of <hi>France,</hi> (whom he had persuaded, That almost all the <hi>Scots</hi> had secretly confederated with the Queen of <hi>England</hi>;) yea, he had made a Boast to him, like a <hi>Bragadochio</hi> as he was, That he did, as it were, hold the Fetters of <hi>Scotland</hi> in his own Hands; and when ever the <hi>French</hi> had leisure from other Wars, if they would but send him a little Assistance, he would ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily clap them on, and bring all <hi>Scotland</hi> under their Power: And the <hi>French</hi> King was as vain, in feeding his senseless Humor, for he sent him some Military Provisions by one <hi>Monsieur Verack,</hi> whom he commanded to stay there, and to give him an Account of all <hi>Scotish</hi> Affairs. Besides, the Insolencie of the Governor was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd by the Treachery of the Garison-Souldiers of <hi>Edinburgh</hi>-Castle, who had lately revolted from the King; and also, he was somewhat animated by the Sickness of the Regent, who was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most kill'd with a Fall from his Horse, and had now the Gout also; and moreover he was incouraged by the Truce, which the Queen of <hi>England</hi> had obtained for them till the End of <hi>March.</hi> These things made him and his Garison-Souldiers so secure and negligent, that they went often to be merry into the Town, and would lie there all Night, as if they had been lull'd in the very Bosom of Peace.</p>
            <p>Matters standing in this Posture, and Preparation being made for the Expedition, as much as the present Haste would permit; <hi>Iohn Cuningham</hi> was sent before with some Horse, to stop all Passengers; that so the Enemy might have no Intelligence of their Coming. <hi>Thomas Crawford</hi> followed after with the Foot; they were appointed to meet together at <note n="*" place="margin">In <hi>Lennox.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Dumbeck,</hi> an Hill about a Mile or two from the Castle, about Midnight. At that Place <hi>Crawford</hi> (as he was commanded) told the Souldiers, What the Design was, they were to go upon, and How they were to effect it; he shew'd them, who was to lead them on, and had promised to scale the Walls, first; and then he, and those Commanders that would be noticed for their
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:56771:358"/>
Valour, were to follow. The Souldiers were easily persuaded to follow their Leaders; whereupon the Ladders were carried, and other things, to storm the Castle; and the Foot, a little before Day, march'd on towards it. The Horse were commanded to stay in the same Place, to expect the Issue, whether good or bad. As they were approaching the Castle, they met with two Rubs or Checks; One was, That the Bridg over the Brook, that runs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Fields, was broken; and Next, A Fire, appearing sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly near it, occasioned a Suspicion, lest the Bridg was broken on Purpose to stop the Enemy; and the Fire kindled by the Garison-Souldiers, to discover and prevent the Enemies Approach: But this Fear was soon dispell'd, by their repairing the Bridg, as well as they could, in such haste, and making it passable for the Foot; and also the Scouts were sent out to the Place, where the Fire was seen, and they could find no Sign of any Fire at all;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ignis Fatuus</hi>; Country Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple call it, <hi>Iack with a Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorn,</hi> or <hi>Will with a Wisp.</hi>
               </note> so that the Fire was of a Meteorous Nature, like those Fires which are bred in the Air, and sometimes pitch on the Ground, and presently vanish away; but they had a greater Cause of Fear, lest the Heaven which was all bespangled with Stars, and the Approach of the Day, should discover them to the Sentinels, that watch'd above; but, behold! on a sudden, a thick Mist covered the Heavens, yet so that it reach'd not beyond the middle Rock of the Castle, but the upper Part of it was so dark, that the Guards in the Castle could see nothing of what was done below. But as the Mist came seasonably, so there was another Misfortune, which fell out very unluckily, and had almost marr'd the whole Business: For, many Ladders being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to get up that high Rock, and the first were unmanageable, by reason of their Length; they, being over-loaden with the Weight of those who went hastily up, and being not well fastned at Foot in a slippery Soil, fell suddenly down with those that were upon them: That Accident cast them into a great Consternation at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent; but when they found, that no Body was hurt in the Fall, they recollected their Spirits, which were almost desponding; and, as if God Almighty had favoured their Design, they went on, upon that dangerous Service, with greater Alacrity, so that they set the Ladders up again, more cautiously; and when they came to the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the Rock, there was a Place reasonably convenient, where they might stand, and there they found an Ash Shrub, casually growing amongst the Stones, which did them great Service, for they tied Ropes to it, and let them down; by which means, they lifted up their Fellows, that were left below; so that, at one and the same time, some were drawn up by the Ropes to the middle of the Rock; and others, by setting other Ladders, got up to the Top thereof. There also they met with a new and unexpected Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, which had almost spoiled all their Measures; for one of the Souldiers, as he was in the middle of the Ladder, was suddenly taken with a kind of Fit of an Apoplexy, so that he stuck fast to the Ladder, and could not be pluck'd therefrom, but stopp'd the Way to those that would ascend. This Danger was also overcome by the Diligence and Alacrity of the Souldiers, for they bound him to the Ladder, so that when he recovered out of his Fit, he could not fall;
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:56771:358"/>
and then in great Silence, turning the Ladder, the rest easily as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended; when they came to the Top of the Rock, there was a Wall built by Hand, to which they were to put their third Ladders, to get over it. <hi>Alexander Ramsy,</hi> with two Files of Musqueteers, got upon it; the Sentinel presently spied him, gave the Alarm, and cast down Stones upon him, and his Men; <hi>Alexander</hi> being assaulted with this unusual kind of Fight, as having neither Stones to throw again, nor an Helmet to defend him, yet leap'd down from the Wall into the Castle, and there was set upon by Three of the Guard; he fought it out valiantly with them, till his Fellow-Souldiers, being more solicitous for his Danger, than their own, leapt down after him, and presently dispatch'd the three Sentinels. In the mean time, the rest made what haste they could, so that the Wall being old, loose, and overcharged with the Weight of those who made haste to get over it, fell down to the Ground; and by its Fall, as there was a Breach made for the rest to enter, so the Ruins made the Descent more easy through the Rock, that was very high and rugged within the Castle; whereupon, they entred in a Body, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out with a great Noise; <hi>For God and the King</hi>; and often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming the Name of the Regent also; so that the Guards were amazed, and forgot to fight, but fled every one to shift for himself, as well as he could; some kept themselves within Doors, till the first brunt of the Souldiers Fury was over. <hi>Flemming</hi> escaped the Danger, by slipping down through the oblique Rock, having but one in his Company, who was knock'd down, and fell, but he, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending a by-way, was let out at the Gate, and so got into a Vessel on the River, which, by reason of the Tides being in, came up to the Walls of the Castle, and so fled into <hi>Argyle.</hi> The Sentinels of the lower Castle, and twenty five more of the Garison-Souldiers,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dumbarton</hi>-Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle taken by Surprize.</note> who had been Drinking and Whoring in the Town all Night, taking the Alarum, never offered to fight, but fled every one which way he could. There were taken in the Castle <hi>Iohn Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> Arch-bishop of S. <hi>Andrews; Iohn Flemming</hi> of <hi>Bogal</hi>; a young <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Gentleman, that had fled from the last Insurrection in <hi>England; Verac</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Man, who, a good while before, had been sent to them with some Warlike Furniture and Provisions, and staid there in the Name of his King, to acquaint the <hi>French</hi> King with the State of <hi>Scotish</hi> Affairs: <hi>Alexander,</hi> the Son of <hi>William Levingston,</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to escape by changing his Habit, but was discovered, and brought back. The Regent being inform'd of the taking the Castle, before Noon came thither: 1<hi>st.</hi> He highly commended the Souldiers, then he comforted <hi>Flemming</hi>'s Wife,<note place="margin">The Regent's Clemency to <hi>Flemming</hi> the Governor's Wife.</note> and gave her not only her own Furniture, Plate, and all her Houshold-stuff, and Utensils, but also assigned an Estate, part of her Husband's, which had long before been forfeited into the King's Exchequer, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain her Self and Children: The rest of the Booty was allowed the Souldiers. Having setled things thus, he had Leisure to take a View of the Castle; and coming to the Rock, by which the Souldiers got up, it seem'd so difficult an Ascent to them all, that the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers themselves confess'd, if they had foreseen the Danger of the Service, no Reward whatsoever should have hired them to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:56771:359"/>
it. <hi>Verac</hi> was accused by the Merchants, that, whereas they came into the Bay of <hi>Clyde,</hi> he had robb'd them in an Hostile Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: Whereupon, many of the Council were of Opinion, he should have been Indicted as a Pirate or Robber; but the empty Name of an Embassador prevailed more with the Regent, which yet he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self had violated by his flagitious Actions: Wherefore, that the despoil'd Persons might be kept in some Hope (at least) of Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction from him; he was kept seemingly for a Trial, and lodg'd in an House at St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> whose Owner was inclined to the Rebels; whence he was taken away, as 'twere by Force, which was the thing aim'd at, and so he speedily departed. The <hi>English</hi>-Man, though many Suspicions were fix'd upon him; and besides, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendatory Letters of <hi>Iohn Lesly</hi> Bishop of <hi>Ross</hi> to <hi>Flemming,</hi> which were found after the Castle was taken, did convict him, yet he was sent home; but, after he was gone, 'twas found, that he was sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orn'd by the <hi>Norfolkians</hi> to poison the King of <hi>Scots: Bogal</hi> was kept Prisoner. There was one Prisoner more, which the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour most desired to have punish'd, That was the Bishop of St. <hi>Andrews:</hi> He, in former times, while his Brother was Regent, had advised him to many cruel and avaricious Practices; and under the Queen also, he bore the Blame of all Miscarriages. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent feared, if he should delay his Punishment, the Queen of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> would intercede for him, and the Arch-bishop's Friends were in great Hopes of it; and, lest Straitness of time should prevent them, the Arch-bishop earnestly desired, he might be tried by the Legal Way of the Country, for that would occasion some, though not much Delay. But these Interposals were over-ruled, it being alleged, That there was no need of any new Process, in the Arch-Bishops case, for it had been already judg'd in the Parliament. Wherefore he, being plainly convicted as guilty of the King's Murder, and of the last Regents also, was hang'd at <hi>Sterlin.</hi> There was then new Evidence brought in against him,<note place="margin">The Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of St. <hi>Andrews</hi> exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted as guilty of the King's and Regent's Murders, with Evidences pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the same.</note> for, the greatest Part thereof had been discovered, but lately. The Arch-Bishop of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> who lodg'd in the next House, when the Proposition of killing the King was made to him, willingly undertook it, both by Reason of old Feuds between their Families, and also an Hope thereby to bring the Kingdom nearer to his Family; whereupon, he chuses out six or eight of the most flagitious of his Vassals, and commended the Matter to them, giving them the Keyes of the King's Lodgings; they then enter very silently into his Chamber, and strangle him, when he was asleep; and when they had so done, they carried out his Body through a little Gate, (of which I spake before) into an Orchard adjoining to the Walls; and then a Sign was given to blow up the House. The Discovery of this Wickedness was made by <hi>Iohn Hamilton,</hi> who was a chief Actor therein, upon this Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: He was much troubled in his Mind, Day and Night, his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science tormenting him for the Guilt of the Fact, and not only so, but, as if the Contagion reach'd to his Body too, That also was mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably pained and consumed by degrees; endeavouring all ways to ease himself, at last he remembred, That there was a School-Master at <hi>Pasley,</hi> no bad Man, who was yet a Papist; to him he confesses

                  </gap> that horrid Crime</note> and the Names of those who joined with him in perpetrating the Murder: The Priest comforted him, what he could, and put him in mind of the Mercy of God; yet, because the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease had taken deeper root, than to be expiable by such slight Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, within a few days, he was overwhelmed with Grief, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The Priest was not so silent in the thing, but that some ink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of it came to the King's Friends. They, many Months after the Murder was committed, when <hi>Matthew,</hi> Earl of <hi>Lennox,</hi> was Regent, and when <hi>Dunbarton</hi> was taken, and the Bishop brought to <hi>Sterlin,</hi> caused the Priest to be sent for, thither: He then justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, what he had spoken before, about the King's Murder; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, being ask'd by <hi>Hamilton,</hi> How he came to know it? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther 'twere revealed to him in Auricular Confession? He told him, Yes; then said <hi>Hamilton,</hi> You are not ignorant of the Punishment due to those, who reveal the Secrets of Confessions, and made no other Answer to the Crime. After fifteen Months or more, the same Priest was taken, saying Mass the third time; and, as the Law ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, was led out to suffer; then also he publickly declared all, that he had before affirm'd in the thing, in plainer and fuller words, which were so openly divulged, that now <hi>Hamilton</hi>'s Vassals fell out amongst themselves, and one of them charged another with the King's Death.</p>
            <p>In the mean while, the Rebels had procured some small matter of Mony from <hi>France,</hi> by means of the Brother of him, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Edinburgh</hi>-Castle.

               <hi>Morton</hi> was returned from his <hi>English</hi> Embassy, and, in a Convention of the Nobles held at <hi>Sterlin,</hi> declar'd the Effect thereof, in these Words;</p>

               <q>When we came to <hi>London, February</hi> 20. we were put over to a Council, chosen out for that purpose; who, after much Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute betwixt us, at last, insisted upon two Points, First, That we would produce the clearest and best Arguments we had, to evidence the Justness of those Actions, which had pass'd in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> both formerly and now, that so the Queen might be satisfied in the Equity of them, and thereby know how to answer those, who demanded a Reason for them: If we could not do That, yet the Queen would omit nothing which might conduce to our Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. In Answer to which, we gave in a Memorial to Them, to this effect; The Crimes, wherewith, at first, our King's Mother alleged, that she was falsly charged with, have been so clearly prov'd by the Earl of <hi>Murray,</hi> and his Associates in that Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy, That both the Queen her self, and those, who were delegated by her, to hear the Cause, could not be ignorant of the Author of the King's Murder, which was the Source of all our other Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: To repeat them again before the Queen, who, we doubt not, is therein sufficiently satisfied already, we think it not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary; and besides, we our selves are unwillingly drawn into the Task of repeating the Memory of so great a Wickedness. But they, who cannot deny, that this Fact was cruelly and flagitiously perpetrated, yet do calumniate the Resignation of the Kingdom, and the Translation of the Government from the Mother to the Son, to be a new and grievous thing, extorted from her by mere

Force. First, as for the Matter of Fact, in punishing our Princes, the old Custom of our Ancestors will not suffer it to be called <hi>new</hi>; neither can the Moderateness of the Punishment make it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidious: 'Tis not needful for us to reckon up the many Kings, whom our Forefathers have chastis'd by Imprisonment, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, yea, Death it self; much less need we confirm our Practice by foreign Examples, of which there are abundance in old Histories.<note place="margin">The Original of Kingly Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                  </note> The Nation of the <hi>Scots</hi> being at first free, by the common Suffrage of the People, set up Kings over them, conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally, That, if need were, they might take away the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by the same Suffrages that gave it: The Footsteps of this Law remain to this very Day, for, in the circumjacent Islands, and in many Places of the Continent too, which have retained the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Speech and Customs of our Fore-fathers to this Day; the same Course is yet observed, in creating their Magistrates. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, those Ceremonies, which are used in the Inauguration of our Kings themselves, have an express Representation of this Law,<note place="margin">Kingly Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, What?</note> by which it easily appears, That Kingly Government is nothing else, but a mutual Stipulation betwixt King and People; and the same is most clearly evidenced by the inoffensive Tenor of the Old Law, which hath been observed ever since there was a King in <hi>Scotland,</hi> even unto this present time, no Man having ever attempted to abrogate, abate, or diminish this Law, in the least. 'Tis too long to enumerate, How many Kings our Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors have put by their Kingdoms, have banish'd, have imprison'd, have put to Death; neither is there the least mention made of the Severity of this Law, or the abrogating thereof, and that on good Grounds: For 'tis not of the Nature of such Sanctions, which are subject to the Mutations of Time; but, in the very Original of Mankind, 'twas ingraven in Mens Hearts, approv'd by the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Consent of almost all Nations, and, together with Nature it self, was to remain inviolate and sempiternal; so that these Laws are not subject to the Empire of any Men, but all Men subject to the Dominion and Power of Them. This Law prescribes to us in all our Actions, 'tis always before our Eyes and Minds, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we will or no; it dwells in us: Our Ancestors followed it, in repressing the Violence of Tyrants by armed Force. 'Tis a Law, not proper to the <hi>Scots</hi> only, but common to all Nations and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in well-instituted Governments. To pass by the famous Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Athens, Sparta, Rome, Venice,</hi> who never suffer'd this Right to be taken from them, but with their Liberty it self: Even in those Times, wherein Oppression and Tyranny were most tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant in the <hi>Roman</hi> Government, if any good Man were cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen Emperour, he counted it his Glory, to confess himself inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to the whole Body of the People, and to be subject to the Law.<note place="margin">

the Laws:</hi> Yea, the most barbarous Nations, such as were most remote from all Civility, had a Sense and Knowledg hereof, as the History of all Nations, and common Observation, shews. But, not to insist on obsolete Examples, I will produce Two in our own Memory; Of late, <hi>Christiern</hi> of <hi>Denmark,</hi> for his Cruelty,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Christiern,</hi> of <hi>Denmark,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed.</note> was dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out of the Kingdom, with all his Lineage, a greater Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than ever our People exacted from any of their Kings, for they never punish'd the Sins of the Fathers upon their Children. As for him, he was deservedly punish'd, after a singular manner, as the Monster of his Age, for all kind of Wickedness. But what did the Mother of the Emperour, <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, do, as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve perpetual Imprisonment? She was a Woman in her flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Age, and her Husband died young, even in the Prime of his Age; it was reported, She had a mind to marry again, she was not accus'd for any Wickedness, but for a certain allowable Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, (as the severe <hi>Cato</hi>'s of the Age speak); and, as the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Manners now are, of an honest Copulation, approved by God's and Man's Law, both. If the Calamity of our Queen be compared with <hi>Christiern</hi>'s of <hi>Denmark,</hi> she is not less an Offender, (to say no more,) but she hath been more moderately proceeded against and punish'd: But, if she be compared with <hi>Ioan</hi> of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stria, Charles</hi> his Mother, what did that poor Lady do, but desire, as far as lawfully she might, a Pleasure allowed by the Law, and a Remedy necessary for her Age? Yet, being an innocent Woman, she suffer'd that Punishment, of which our Queen, convict of the highest Wickedness, doth now complain: The Murder of her lawful Husband, and her unlawful Marriage with a publick Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricide, have now those same Deprecators, who, in killing the King, did inflict the Punishment, due to wicked Men, on the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent. But here they remember not, what the Examples of their Ancestors do prompt them to do; neither are they mindful of that eternal Law, which our noble Progenitors, even from the first beginnings of Kingdoms, having followed, have thereby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd the Violence of Tyrants. And, in our present Case, what have we done more, than trod in the Steps of so many Kingdoms and free Nations, and so bridled that Arbitrariness, which claim'd a Power above Law? And yet, we have not done it with that Severity neither, as our Ancestors have us'd in the like kind; for they would never have suffer'd any one, who had been found guilty of such a notorious Crime, to escape the Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Law. If we had imitated Them, we had been free from fear of Danger, and also from the Trouble of Calumniators; and, that may be easily known by the Postulations of our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries. How often have they criminated and arraigned us before our Neighbour-Princes? What Nations do they not solicite, and stir up against us? What do they desire by this Importunity? Is it only. That the Controversy may be decided by Law and Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? We never refused That Condition; and they would never ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of It, though 'twere often offer'd them. What then do they desire? Even This, That we should arm Tyrants, by Publick Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, who are manifestly guilty of the most notorious Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:56771:362"/>
who are stuff'd with the Spoils of their Subjects, besmear'd with the Blood of Kings, and aim at the Destruction of all good Men? Shall we set them up over our Lives, who are found Actors in the Parricide, and shrewdly suspected to be the Design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of it, without acquitting themselves in a Judiciary way? And yet, we have gratified their Request, more than the Custom of our Country, the Severity of the Law, or the Distribution of equal Justice would allow. There is nothing more frequently celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, nor more diligently handled, by the Writers of our History, than our Punishment of evil Kings. And amongst so many pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant Governours, who ever felt the like Lenity of angry Subjects, in inflicting Punishment, as we have used in punishing our King's Mother, though evidently guilty of a most atrocious Crime? What Ruler, standing convict of Murder, had ever power given to substitute a Son, or Kinsman in his, or her, place: To whom, in such Circumstances, also was the Liberty ever granted, to appoint what Guardians they pleas'd, to the succeeding King? And in the very Abjuration of the Kingdom, Who can complain of any hard Usage? A young Woman, unable to undergo the Burden, and toss'd by the Storms of unsettled Affairs, sent Letters to the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, to free her from That Government, which was as burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som to her, as it was honourable: It was granted her: She desir'd the Government might be transferr'd from her to her Son; her Request was assented to: She also desir'd to have the Naming of the Guardians, who might manage the Government, till her Son came to be of Age; it was done, as she desir'd: And, that the thing might have more Authority, the whole Matter was referr'd to the Estates in Parliament, who Voted, That all was rightly done, and in good order, and they confirm'd it by an Act, than which there cannot be a more sacred and a firmer Obligation. But 'tis alleged, What was done in Prison, is to be taken, not as done willingly, but forc'd by Durance, for fear of Death; and so many other things, which Men are inforc'd to do for fear, are wont, as they ought, to go for Nothing. Indeed, this Excuse of Fear, as sometimes it is, not without reason, admitted by the Judges, so it doth not always infer a just Cause for abolishing a publick Act, once made, in a Suit of Law; if a Man strike a Fear into his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary for ones own Advantage, and so the Plaintiff extorts more from the Defendant, than he could ever obtain by the Equity of the Law: Those Remedies are most rightfully and deservedly provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded against such, as are either terrified by Compulsion, or inforc'd by Fear, to do what is prejudicial to themselves. But 'tis other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, If a guilty Conscience creates a Fear to it self, out of an Expectation of a deserved Punishment, to avoid which, he assents to some certain Conditions: This Fear carries with it no just Cause to rescind publick Acts; for otherwise, the wickeder a Person is, so much the easier Retreat he might have to the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary of the Law; and then, the Remedies found out for the Relief of the Innocent, would be transferred to indemnify the Nocent. And the Laws themselves, the Avengers of Wrongs, would not be a Refuge to good Men, when vex'd by the Improbity of the
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:56771:362"/>
Bad; but an unjust Shelter to the Evil, when they fear deserv'd Punishment. But that Fear, let it be what it will, wherein hath it made the Condition of the Queen, the worse? The Title of Kingly Dignity, and the Power of Government, was long since taken from Her by Parliament; and being reduc'd to her Privacy, she liv'd a precarious Life, upon the account of the Peoples Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, not her own Innocency; When therefore she was put by the Kingdom, what did she lose by her fear? Her Dominion was ended before, she only cast away the empty Name of <hi>Ruler,</hi> and that which might lawfully have been extorted from her against her Will, she parted with of her own accord, and so redeem'd the resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due of her Life, the Sentiment of her Infamy, the perpetual Fear of imminent Death, which is worse than Death it self, only by the laying down the Shadow of a mere Title and Name. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I wonder, that, on this Head, no Body discovers the Prevari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Queen's Delegates, and of her Embassadors. For they, who desire, That what was done in Prison, by the Queen, may be undone, ask this also, That she may be restor'd to that Place, from which, she complains, she was ejected, through Fear. And what is that Place, to which they so earnestly desire, she should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor'd? She was remov'd from governing the Kingdom before, all publick Administration was taken away from her, and she was left to the Punishment of the Law. Now these goodly Advocates, forsooth, would have her restor'd to that Place, as to plead for her self in a Cause which is as manifest, as 'tis foul and detestable; or, rather, it being already prov'd, that she should suffer just Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the same. And whereas, now she injoys some ease in the Compassion of her Kindred, and, in so foul an Offence, is not in any of the worst Cases, they would again cast her into the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pestuous Hurry of a new Judgment; She having no better hope of her Safety, than she can gather from the Condemnation of so many former Kings, who have been called before Judges to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer for themselves. But, because our Adversaries do seditiously boast, to trouble the Minds of the simpler Sort, That the Majesty of good Kings is impair'd and their Authority almost vilifi'd, if Tyrants be punish'd, let us see, what Weight there is in this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. We may rather contrarily judge, That there is nothing more honourable for the Societies and Assemblies of the <hi>Good,</hi> than if they are freed from the Contagion of the <hi>Bad.</hi> Who ever thought, that the Senate of <hi>Rome</hi> incurr'd any Guilt, by the Punishment of <hi>Lentulus, Cethegus,</hi> or <hi>Catiline:</hi> And <hi>Valerius Asiaticus,</hi>

Did the Imprisonment of
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:56771:363"/>
                  <hi>Christiern</hi> of <hi>Denmark</hi> detract any thing from the Commendation of <hi>Christiern,</hi> the next King? What hindred, but that he might have been accounted the best of Kings, in his time; For a noble Mind, that is supported by his own Virtue, doth neither increase by the Glory, nor is lessened by the Infamy, of another. But to let these things pass, let us return to the Proof of the Crime. I think, we have abundantly satisfi'd the Queen's Request; her desire was, That we should shew her such strengthning and convincing Proofs, for what we have done, that she might be satisfied in the justness of our Cause; and also, be able to inform Others, who desir'd to hear, what we could say for our Selves. As for the King's Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; the Author, the Method, and the Causes thereof, have been so fully declar'd by the Earl of <hi>Murray</hi> and his Fellows in that Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassy, that they must needs be clear to the exact Judgments of the Queen, and those Others, delegated by her to hear that Affair. As for what is objected to us, as blame-worthy, after that time, we have shewn, That 'tis consentaneous to the Divine Law, and also to the Law of Nature, which too is, in a sort, Divine; More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, 'tis consonant to our own Country-Laws and Customs; Neither is it different from the Usage of other Nations, who have the Face of any Good and just Government amongst them; Seeing then, that our Cause is justifi'd by all the Interpreters of Divine and Human Laws; seeing the Examples of so many Ages, the Judgments of so many People, and the Punishments of Tyrants do confirm it, we see no such Novelty (not to say, Injustice) in our Cause, but that the Queen her self might readily subscribe to it; yea, and persuade others, that, in this Matter, they should be no otherwise opinionated of us, but that we have carried our Selves like good Subjects and Christians, too.</q>
            </p>
            <p>These were the Allegations, which, we thought fit, to make to justify our Cause, which we committed to writing, and read them the last day of <hi>February,</hi> before those grave and learned Persons, whom the Queen had appointed to confer with us, on this Subject; and the next Day, which was <hi>March</hi> the first, We again went, in the Morning, to Court, to learn, how she relish'd our Answer, and what Judgment she made of the whole Cause; but, because she, that Day, was going to her Country-House, called <hi>Greenwich,</hi> about three Miles below <hi>London,</hi> we had no Opportunity to speak with her; What was Next to that, we went to the Chief of the Council, who, at first, were appointed to hear and transact with us;
<q>They told us, That the Queen (though she had very little spare time, in regard of the Journy, and other Business, yet) had read our Memorial: But she was not yet so fully persuaded, that our Cause was so just, that She could approve it without Scruple; and therefore, she desired us to go to the Second thing, at first proposed by us, which was, To find out some Way, whereby this Dispute might be ended, upon some moderate or handsom Conditions.</q>
Whereunto we replied,
<q>That we were not sent from home with an unbounded Commission, but One circumscribed within certain Limits; so that we had no Freedom to enter into any Debate at all, of what might in the least diminish the Authority of our
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:56771:363"/>
King; and if such a Liberty had been offered us, yet we should have been unwilling to accept it; or to make use of it, if accepted.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Matters standing thus; the Queen being at <hi>Greenwich,</hi> and we at <hi>London,</hi> we sent some of our Number to her, to know, <q>Whether she had any thing more to say to us? if not, that we might have Liberty to depart home, there to consult, what we could, the Good of our Country, and our own private Concerns: And if there were any thing, we might gratify her Majesty in; We were willing to shew our Obsequiousness and Respect therein; yea, we should take more Opportunity to shew it at home, than we could have now in anothers Dominions. This Demand procur'd us a Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to appear at Court, the 5<hi>th</hi> of <hi>March:</hi> When we were come into her Presence, she mightily blam'd our stifness in maintaining our conceiv'd Opinion, and that we did so pertinaciously shun a Dispute, or rather a Consultation, about a Matter so much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning our Security; She also added a large Declaration of her Mind and Will anent the King, and Those who maintain'd his Cause. We urg'd, that the Justness of our Cause had been clearly enough declar'd, before. She answer'd, that she was not satisfi'd in her Mind, with the Examples and Arguments produc'd by us; neither, said she, am I wholly ignorant of such Disputes, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving spent some of my former time in the Study of the Law: But, says she, if you be fully determin'd to make no other Proposal for your King's Safety, and your Own; yet, I would have you, at least, enter upon another Conference, with the Chief of my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, who treated with you about these things, before. We answer'd, That we were not at all so stiffly wedded to our own Opinions, as not to be willing to hear any good Expedient, that might be offer'd by her, or her Counsellors; always with this Proviso, That no Alteration be made in the present State of the Kingdom; nor any Diminution at all of the King's Authority: For, upon those Two Heads, we neither could, or would, admit the least Consultation or Debate. The Day after, we went down again to the Queen's Palace, (as we agreed) and entred into a Conference with her Counsellors, where many Proposals were made by them to decide the Controversy, between Mother and Son, concerning the Title to the Government; We, because the Reasons were many, and concerning Matters of such great Moment on both sides, desir'd, That we might have them given to us in writing, and Time allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us, to consider of Things of such great Consequence. They were very ready to do it, having first consulted the Queen. When we had ran Them all over in order, the Matters propos'd seem'd so difficult to us, and also so derogatory to the Power of the King; and withal, so exceeding the Bounds of our Embassy and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, that we neither would, could, nor durst, touch upon them. The Day after, <hi>Robert Petcarn</hi> was sent to Court with this Answer, That such Matters did belong to the Decision of all the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states, and were not to be disputed by so small a Number of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons as we were.</q>
He also carried our Answer to Them, who the Day before, <hi>viz.</hi> the 4<hi>th</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> had desir'd to have all in writing.
<q>Further, he earnestly desir'd the Queen, that, seeing they had exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:56771:364"/>
all the points within the Bounds of their Commission; They might have leave to return home. Ten Days after, we had liberty to attend the Queen: The Delegates of the Council, who, from our first coming, were appointed to treat with us, were very ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, That we would yet treat with them, about finding out some Remedies, to compose Things; They us'd many Arguments to that purpose, telling us, That if War from abroad should be added to our Troubles at home, our Labours, Dangers and Difficulties would be doubled, especially, being not able to extricate our selves by our own Forces. But we persisted in our Resolution, and would hearken to no Model of Accommodation, which lessened the King's Authority, and so that Day ended.</q>
The next Day, which was the 20<hi>th</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> we were sent for again to Court, and being commanded to come to the Queen, she spake to us to this purpose;
<q>That she, and her Council, had weigh'd our Answers, by which she understood, That none but a Supream Council, or Parliament of <hi>Scotland,</hi> consisting of all the Estates, could give a certain Answer to her Demands; and thereupon, she had found out a Way, how to leave the matter intire, as she found it, and with an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest Pretence too. She was inform'd, that there was shortly to be a Convention of all the Estates in <hi>Scotland,</hi> thither we should go, and God speed us well, and therein we should endeavour, that an equal Number of both Factions should be chosen to examine the Grounds of the Difference betwixt them; and that she also would send her Embassadors thither, which should join Endeavours with Those, to promote a Peace; In the mean time, she desir'd, That the Pacification might be renew'd, till the Matter was brought to some Issue. She said also, That she would confer with the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> Embassadors, and persuade them, if she could, to the same. But when 'twas mov'd to Them, they excus'd themselves, saying, That they could determine nothing on that head, without consulting the Queen; but, that they would write to her to know her Pleasure in the Case. Yet we prest hard to have our Convoy to return, as was promised us, but were desir'd to have a little Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, till an Answer was return'd from the <hi>Scots</hi> Queen to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Ross,</hi> and the rest of her Embassadors, and then we should have our Dismission. We urg'd our Return still, but without ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, though we told her, we had nothing to do with the Bishop of <hi>Ross,</hi> neither was our Embassy to him, we had ended what we came for, and did much wonder, why the Bishop of <hi>Ross</hi> should retard our Journy, especially, since so many Tumults were rais'd in our Absence, to the great Inconvenience of the King's Party: But though our Importunity was almost Shameless, yet we could not prevail, for the Matter was deferr'd from Day to Day, till the last of <hi>March,</hi> and then the Queen return'd to <hi>London.</hi>
               </q>
The Things which were acted in Parliament, for 3 Days after, did so take up the Queen, that she had no leisure to debate foreign Matters.
<q>But the 4<hi>th</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> she sent for us, and excus'd the Delay; She told us, That our King's Mother had by her Letters grievously chid her Embassadors for their Presumptuous Confidence in descending to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate her Cause after that Fashion, and therefore, say's the Queen,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:56771:364"/>
seeing they are so averse from the Way of Concord, which I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, I will detain you no longer; but if she hereafter repent of her present Sentiment, (of which I have some hope) and take the Course chalkt out by me, I do not doubt, but you, for your part, will perform your Duty.</q>
Thus we were lovingly and kindly Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist, and, the 8<hi>th</hi> Day of <hi>April,</hi> began our Journy towards our own Country.</p>
            <p>This Account was given at <hi>Sterlin</hi> by the Embassadors before the Convention of the Estates. Whereupon, the Care and Diligence of the Embassadors were unanimously approv'd. Other Matters they referr'd to the <hi>first</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> a Parliament being summon'd against that time. In the mean time, both Parties bestir themselves, one to promote, the other to hinder, the Assembling thereof. The wisest Senators were of opinion, That the Queen of <hi>England</hi> would never let the <hi>Scot's</hi> Queen depart; as foreseeing, how dangerous her Deliverance would be to all <hi>Britain.</hi> In the interim, Mention was made by some, of demanding the <hi>Scot's</hi> King, as an Hostage for his Mother, rather in hopes to hinder a Concord, than to establish it;<note place="margin">Some of Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Counsellors desire the <hi>Scots</hi> King to be sent into <hi>England.</hi>
               </note> for she was well assur'd, that the <hi>Scots</hi> would never yield to it; but there were some potent Men in her Council, who did secretly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi>'s Faction; These were desirous, that the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> should be deliver'd, and thereby the adverse Faction might, in tract of time, be broken and diminish'd, that so, they might obtain that Point from her by Necessity, which, they saw, they could not otherwise do; neither did they doubt, but the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter would come to that Pass, if the R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>bels were assisted with Mony and other Furniture for War from <hi>France,</hi> and the Royalists had their Eye only on the Queen of <hi>England</hi>; who had, at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, largely promis'd them, upon understanding the flagitious Act of the Queen, that she would take a special care of the King and Kingdom of <hi>Scotland.</hi> Neither could the <hi>French</hi> King well compass his Designs. He was willing, the <hi>Scot's</hi> Queen should be deliver'd, but not that the King should be put into <hi>English</hi> Hands; and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, how strong the <hi>Norfolk</hi> Faction was, which was all for Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, he did not despair, but that the <hi>Scot's</hi> Queen might, in time, escape out of Prison privately, or be deliver'd by his Means. Thus stood the State of <hi>Britain,</hi> at that time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Morton,</hi> having given a laudable Account of his Embassy to the Convention at <hi>Sterlin,</hi> return'd to his own House about 4 Miles from <hi>Edinburgh</hi>; he had a Company of 100 Foot, and a few Horse to guard his House, and to defen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There the Convention was held, for the Lawyers gave their Opinions, That 'twas no great Matter, in what Part soever of the City, it met. In this Parliament, These were declar'd Traitors, <hi>viz.</hi> The chief of Them who held out the Castle, especially those, who, out of Consciousness of their guilt of the King's and Regent's Murders, had avoided Tryal.

The Foot was in a manner useless on both sides, because of a great Shower that fell suddenly from the Clouds. In the Pursuit of the <hi>Mortonians,</hi> there were but Two slain, more were wounded, and about 26 taken Prisoners: Of the Rebels, there were more slain, but fewer Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners taken. But one Accident did almost equal the Loss of both Parties: They which came from <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> brought with them a Barrel of Gun-powder, and as the Souldiers, in haste and carelesly, went to take out some Powder, a Spark of Fire light into it, and blew it up, insomuch that the Horse which carried it, <hi>Iames Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,</hi> the Commander of the Foot, and many other Souldiers, were so scorch'd and burnt, that the most Part of them, in a few Days after, died.</p>
            <p>Whilst these things were acting about <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> Victory in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining to neither Side, one Troop of the <hi>Scots,</hi> who, some Years before, had serv'd in <hi>Denmark,</hi> under <hi>Michael Weems,</hi> a noble,<note place="margin">A <hi>Scotch</hi> Troop from <hi>Denmark,</hi> comes to help the Royalists.</note> virtuous, and learn'd young Man, return'd into their own Country, and offer'd their Service to the King, against the Desires of the Townsmen, who would willingly have drawn them over to their Party. They had a little Time allow'd them to visit their Friends; and coming together at the Day appointed, they were imform'd,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:56771:366"/>
That some Ships were mann'd out by the Rebels, to intercept them. <hi>Morton</hi> himself was aware of the Plot, and therefore taking what Force he could, on a sudden, make, without acquainting any Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy with his Design, he came so hastily to <hi>Leith,</hi> that he had almost catch'd them, before they went a Ship-bord, sixteen of the Loite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, who did not make such haste to lanch out their Boat, he took Prisoners, on the Shore. The next Day, he provided Ships, either to follow them, (he could not do it sooner, because of the Tide) or, to intercept them in their Return. The Regent also was made acquainted with it the same Night, who, speedily gathering some Tumultuary Force, hastned to the left Shore of the Fort, to set upon the Rebels, when they landed: But the Speed of the <hi>Danish</hi> Souldiers rendred those Endeavours needless, for the greatest Part of them got aboard a large Vessel, and so past safely over. The rest, who were in a smaller Skiff, were taken, not far from <hi>Leith,</hi> and, being about twenty six, were brought Prisoners to the Castle. After this Action, the Regent returned to <hi>Sterlin: Morton,</hi> being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verladen with Labour and Watching, and troubled with the Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick too, fell sick at <hi>Leith. Drury,</hi> the <hi>English</hi>-Man, who had transacted for a Truce between the Factions for so many Days,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Morton</hi> falls sick at <hi>Leith.</hi>
               </note> could, finally, effect nothing; for the Regent would yield to no other Terms,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Drury</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes in vain between the Parties.</note> but that the Places, which were seized on, during the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Truce, should be restored. When <hi>Drury</hi> was about to depart, the Rebels, as 'twere in Testimony of Respect and Complement to him, drew forth all the Strength that ever they could make, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing, That whilst <hi>Morton</hi> was sick, they should either put their Enemies into a terrible Fright,<note place="margin">The Rebels sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out against <hi>Morton</hi> at <hi>Leith</hi>;</note> who were inferior in Number to themselves; or else, if they durst fight, with the Force they had, without their General, they might do some considerable Execution upon them, toward the ending of the War. <hi>Morton</hi> being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd hereof, by his Guard of Horse, rose presently out of his Bed, and buckles on his Armor, and brings up all his Men into a Neighbour-hill, where he kept them ready for the Onset, about 400 Paces from the Enemy. <hi>Drury</hi> rode between both Armies, and earnestly desired both to return home, and not to brake off all Hope of Accommodation, by over-rash and hasty Counsels; Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, they both agreed to retreat, only the Dispute was, who should turn about their Colours, first. <hi>Drury</hi> endeavoured to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound this Difference also, and desired of Both, that when he, standing in the middle between both Armies, gave a Sign, they should Both retreat, in one and the same Moment. <hi>Morton</hi> was willing, but the Rebels threatned, That unless he retreated first of his own Accord, they would beat him shamefully out of the Field; and indeed, they could hardly be kept from advancing their Bodies toward him. When <hi>Morton</hi> heard this Answer, he sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed he had satisfied <hi>Drury</hi> and the <hi>English,</hi> whom at this time he was unwilling to offend, but would rather have them Witnesses of his Moderation; whereupon, he presently drew forth against the Enemy; first, the Horse made a brisk Charge, and routed the Enemies Wings; the Foot attempted to charge, but were routed also; when the Gate of the next Street, being narrow, could not

Their Flight into the City was so confused, that the Guard left the Gates, and all fled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Castle; so that, if the Enemy that pursued, had not been intent on the Prey, they might have entred also the Town Pell-mell with them, as being unguarded. About 50 of the Rebels were slain, and about 150 taken. <hi>Alexander Hume</hi> had a slight Wound with a Fall from his Horse, and was taken: <hi>Gawen Hamilton</hi> was killed: <hi>Iames Culen, Huntly</hi>'s Kinsman, a Commander of Foot, hid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in a poor Woman's Pantry, but was discovered, and brought to <hi>Leith.</hi> The Common People, when they saw him, made such a Shout, that it plainly appeared, they would not be satisfied,<note place="margin">

He was infamous in his Military Imployment in <hi>France</hi>; and, when the Kings of <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Sweden</hi> were at odds, he promised to serve them Both, and accordingly had Mony to raise Souldiers from either, but couzen'd them Both. And he, being thus taken, at length (as I said) to the great Joy of all, was led forth to his Execution.</p>
            <p>After a few Days Rest, the Townsmen recruited their Forces, and then shewed themselves again in Arms; after that, there were light Skirmishes past betwixt the Parties almost every Day, with various Events. The King's Party were more valorous, but the Rebels had Places more convenient for Ambushes; and besides, they had an high Castle, from whence they might see all the Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their Enemies, neither would they ordinarily venture an Onset any further, than their Ordnance out of the Castle could command. The Regent kept himself at <hi>Leith,</hi> watching all their Sallies, and stopping all Provisions by Sea, for he could not do it by Land, by reason of the Largeness of the City, and Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the adjacent Places, in the surrounding whereof many Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of Service were lost. Whilst these things were acting about the City, a <hi>French</hi> Ship was taken, that brought Gun-Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Iron Bullets, small Brass-Guns, and some Mony to the Rebels.<note place="margin">A Ship from <hi>France,</hi> taken by the Regent.</note> The Mony went to pay the Souldiers, but the Bullets, Powder, and Part of the Guns, being sent with little or no Guard to <hi>Sterlin</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Tide, the Rebels, having Intelligence thereof, procured some Vessels from other Havens, and surprized them; but not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to carry their Booty to the Castle, they sunk it in the River. About the same time, another Ship was also taken, in which there was little else but Letters and large Promises of Assistance, speedily to be sent from <hi>France.</hi> For, during the Two whole last past Years, wherein, at times, there was War in <hi>Scotland</hi>: The Queen of <hi>England,</hi> on behalf of the Royalists; the King of <hi>France,</hi>

               </note> and the <hi>English</hi> Papists, on behalf of the Rebels, did send in some small Drib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blets of Mony, but loaded them with more Promises, as rather studying, that their side might not be conquer'd, rather than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer, respectively; Both of them were willing, Matters should be brought to that Pinch of Necessity: The Queen of <hi>England</hi>'s
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:56771:367"/>
Design was, That the <hi>Scots,</hi> being worn out by their Divisions, might be willing to send their King into <hi>England,</hi> and so seem to depend wholly on her: The <hi>French</hi> did it, That the Rebels might surrender <hi>Dunbarton</hi> and <hi>Edinburgh</hi> to him, and, by those Two com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding Garisons from both Seas, he would keep the <hi>Scots</hi> always in fear of his Arms. But, despairing of the Queen's Delivery, and <hi>Dunbarton</hi> Castle being lost, he mov'd but slowly in the Cause of the Rebels; his Aim only was, That, the Kingdom being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausted with domestick Sedition, he might not undertake a new and unnecessary War, for the sake of one Castle only; it was enough, he thought, at present, if it did not fall into the Enemies Hands.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Scots</hi> were fully resolved not to give up their King to the <hi>English,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>Scots</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to send their young King into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> with their Reasons, why.</note> upon the account of old Controversies; and also, because the <hi>English</hi> Papists were so strong, who plac'd all their Hopes in his Death. For, if he were taken out of the way, the Queen of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> would not only seem weaker, seeing it was the Life of one King only, that delayed their Hopes; but also, the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> was the undoubted Heir of the whole Kingdom, who, by he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Matters standing thus in <hi>Scotland,</hi> Both Factions prepared them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves against the approaching Sitting of the Parliament. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels had only Three of the Lords voting with them, of which Two were the Proctors,<note place="margin">The Rebels Convention at <hi>Edinburgh.</hi>
               </note> or Commissioners, to the Convention, to be held in the Queen's Name. The Third, <hi>Alexander Hume,</hi> was the only Man who had Right to vote: And of the Ecclesiastical Order, Two Bishops, the One banish'd thither a few Months before by the Regent, and, the State of the City being chang'd, not daring to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part without a Convoy, he staid there against his Will: The Other was a Bankrupt, who, having spent his Estate, was driven thither by necessity. By their Votes, above 200 were condemned, some of them being Children under Age. Moreover, the malapert Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, as if they had already got the Victory, divided other Mens Patrimonies among themselves, and so put many quiet and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Persons (and, by that means, more liable to Injuries,) into the Roll of the Confiscate.</p>
            <p>The Regent went to <hi>Sterlin,</hi> where he had a great Convention of the Nobles:<note place="margin">The Regent's Convention at <hi>Sterlin.</hi>
               </note> Therein, about Thirty of the obstinatest of the Queen's Party were condemn'd, the rest were put off, in hopes of Pardon. The Rebels thought this a fit Opportunity for them, to attempt something in the absence of the Nobility; and thereupon, they
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:56771:367"/>
drew all their Forces out of the City, and, to make a greater Show, the Townsmen with them; they set them in Battel-array, that so, as in former times, by light Skirmishes, they might draw the King's Forces out of <hi>Leith.</hi> In the mean time, while the Enemy were kept in play by them, they resolved to send the rest privately to march about, and when the Garison was drawn out, to enter in at the opposite Gate, and so burn the Town.<note place="margin">The Rebels as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault <hi>Leith,</hi> but are repulsed.</note> 
               <hi>Patrick Lindsy</hi> was Governour of <hi>Leith,</hi> a wise and valiant Person; he drew forth his Forces, having sufficiently provided against their Treachery, and marched directly towards the Enemy; they fought stoutly at first, at last, he gave the Rebels a round <hi>Salvo,</hi> and so beat them back, yet not without Loss, to the Gates of the Town; a great many Prisoners were brought off, but the most part of them were Towns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. <hi>Alexander Hume</hi> was taken once, but reliev'd again by his own side. In the Evening, as the King's Party were retreating, joyous for the Victory, <hi>Iames Haliburton,</hi> a good Man,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iames Halibur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> taken Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner by the Rebels, by a Mistake.</note> and a skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Souldier, who commanded all the Foot, being too far from his Body, was taken by a Troop of Horse in the Twilight, when he could not discern of whose Party they were in the High-way, and so carried Prisoner into the City. Upon this Loss, the Rebels took heart, to make another Attempt, as full of Danger and Boldness, so more likely, if it had succeeded, to put an End to the whole War. For, having receiv'd Intelligence by their Spies, That the Nobility of the contrary Faction at <hi>Sterlin</hi> were so careless and remiss, that, in an open Town, they had not so much as a Night-guard, as if it had been a time of perfect Peace, they took 300 Foot, and 200 Horse, and march'd thither; to ease the Foot, who were hastily cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led forth, they took away all the Country-mens Horses, who came to Market the Day before; and if they occasionally lighted on any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Horses by the way, they took them also. The Captains,<note place="margin">The bold At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the Rebels to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize <hi>Sterlin,</hi> and the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of the Convention there assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled:</note> in that Expedition, were <hi>George Gordon, Claud Hamilton,</hi> and <hi>Walter Scot,</hi> they were much encouraged to the Undertaking by <hi>George Bell,</hi> an Ensign of a Foot-Company, who was born at <hi>Sterlin,</hi> he knew all the convenient Passages and Accesses into the Town, and was made acquainted, in Writing, with all the Noble Mens Lodgings; he gave them assured Hopes, That they would quickly master all, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch, that they were so confident of Success in their March, as to appoint Whom to kill, and Whom to save alive. They came to the Town early in the Morning, and found things in profound Security, not so much as a Dog opened his Mouth against them; so they silently enter'd the Town, and, without any resistance, went up to the Market-place; they set Guards at all the Passes thither, and then went to the Noblemens Lodgings; the rest were easily taken, only <hi>Iames Douglas,</hi> Earl of <hi>Morton,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Which, in part, took Effect.</note> put some stop to them in his Lodging; when they could not break in upon him by Force, they set fire to the House; one or two of his Servants, who stoutly defended the Passes, were slain, and he himself, when all was a fire, hardly escaping out of the Flames, surrendred himself to <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Scot,</hi> his Kinsman, then near at hand. Moreover, the Regent was taken Prisoner at the same time; his Men did not stand it out valiantly in his Defence, but he was forc'd to defend himself alone,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:56771:368"/>
and, at last, was taken Prisoner. <hi>Alexander,</hi> Earl of <hi>Glencarn,</hi> and <hi>Hugh,</hi> Earl of <hi>Eglington,</hi> were reserv'd, under a Guard, for Execution: For <hi>Claud Hamilton</hi> told his Men, <hi>They should kill all the Nobles of the contrary Faction, as soon as ever they pass'd out of the Gates, without any distinction.</hi> All Things thus succeeding, beyond Expectation, the common Souldiers scattered themselves all over the Town to get Plunder. Thereupon, <hi>Iohn Erskin,</hi> Governour of the Castle, who had before tried to break through the Enemy in the Market-Place, but in vain, they were so strongly posted, sent a Party of Musqueteers into his own new House, which was then a building, and not quite finish'd, from whence there was a Pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect into the whole Market-Place. This House, because it was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inhabited, and not compleated, was neglected by the Enemy, and afforded a safe Post to the Royalists, whence to play on their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies:<note place="margin">The Rebels beaten again out of <hi>Sterlin,</hi> by the Valour of <hi>Iohn Erskin,</hi> Governour of the Castle.</note> When the Rebels saw, that they were shot at from an high Place, garison'd against them, with unequal Weapons, they present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly turn'd their backs, and ran away in such Fear, that, when they came to the narrow Way leading to the Gate, they trod down one another: That which saved them, was, There were but few to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue, for they who had driven them out of the Market-Place, could come out but one by one, through the Gate of the new House, which was but one neither, and that half-shut too, towards the Town; and but a few came forth from other Houses, where they stood armed, ready for all Events. Thus the whole Souldiery, which, the Day before, had attempted so desperate a piece of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and had almost successfully finish'd it, were driven out of the Town, in such Fear and Confusion, that they left their Prisoners, and every one shifted for himself. In this Onset, there was only one Man of Note slain, and that was <hi>George Ruven,</hi> a young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of great Hopes, who, pressing too eagerly upon the thickest of the Enemies, lost his Life. And <hi>Alexander Stuart</hi> of <hi>Gairlice,</hi> when he was led away Prisoner, was killed; 'tis not known, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by his own Men, or the Enemy. In this great Trepidation and Affrightment, they, who before kept within their own Doors for fear, now came abroad. They, who had taken <hi>Iames Douglas,</hi> and <hi>Alexander Cuningham,</hi> Prisoners, seeing no hopes to escape, sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred themselves up to their Captives. <hi>David Spence,</hi> Captain of Horse amongst the Rebels, was leading away the Regent; he knew, that many lay in wait for his Life, and therefore he defended him with all the Care he could;<note place="margin">The Regent slain in this Scuffle, with Capt. <hi>Spence,</hi> who endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to save him.</note> insomuch, that when the Ruffians aim'd at and shot the Regent, they hit him too, and he died the same Day, to the great grief of both Parties, for he was an accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished young Man, in all Endowments both of Body and Mind, and inferiour to no Man of his Age in <hi>Scotland.</hi> After his Decease, the Enemies Horse never did any memorable Service. Two of the Regent's Murderers <note n="*" place="margin">For killing him, after he had Quarter given him.</note> were put to Death, not being able to escape: The rest fled in such Fear, that the Prisoners, whom they had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, escap'd out of their Hands. For certain, the Whole of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Party might have been destroyed, if there had been Troops enow of Horse to have pursued: But the Tories of <hi>Teviotdale,</hi> at their first Entrance into the Town, had plundred all the Horses, That saved
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:56771:368"/>
them. The slain of Both sides were almost equal: Of the Royalists, not a Man was carry'd away Prisoner; of the other side, many; most of which were intent upon the Prey, and so were taken in the Houses which they were a rifling: The Regent died the same Day of his Wounds. His Funerals were celebrated in haste, as well as they could, in such an Hurry, and then the Nobles, which were there, Assembled, to create another Regent to succeed him.<note place="margin">Three Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitors for the Regency.</note> They chose Three out of their own Number; having first given them an Oath, to stand to the Decision of the Nobility, and thus, as Candidates, they were to expect the Issue of the next Assembly. The Three were, <hi>Gilespy Cambel,</hi> Earl of <hi>Argyle; Iames Douglas,</hi> Earl of <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>; and <hi>Iohn Erskin,</hi> Earl of <hi>Marr.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iohn Erskin,</hi> Earl of <hi>Marr,</hi> chosen Regent.</note> All the Votes pitched on <hi>Iohn Erskin.</hi> His first attempt, was, to assault <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> there having been an Army appointed to be levy'd by the former Regent against the <hi>first</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> but this sudden change of Affairs made it to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred till the 15<hi>th</hi> of the same Month; that Delay was a great hindrance to Business, for it gave liberty to the Townsmen, who wrought Night and Day, to perfect their Works; so that the early Winter, the long Nights, the bad Weather, in those cold Countries,<note place="margin">He assaults <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinburgh,</hi> but without effect.</note> the Difficulty of conveying Provisions, and his want of Military Accommodations, caused him to return, without carrying the Place.</p>
            <p>For some Months succeeding, Sallies were made, but of no great Advantage to either side. For the Prospect of the Castle, being free and open to all Parts, gave Opportunity to the Rebels, that they would never come to handy-Blows, nor yet fall into any Ambush; for, by a Signal given from an high Place in the Castle, they were easily warn'd, to retreat in time; yet once, when all the Horse and Foot issu'd out of the Town, to intercept a few of the Royalists, and they prest upon them, who pretended hastily to fly away: When they in the Castle saw the Colours of some Companies start up, from a neighbour-Valley, presently they sounded a Retreat to them. Whereupon the Rebels, before they came to the Place of Ambush, retreated back in great Fear, and their flight was so much the more confus'd, because, though they were advis'd of their Danger before-hand, yet they did not know, What, or from Whence, it was, nor could they so much as suspect it; Those few Horsemen, which before counterfeited to fly away, did so press upon their Rear, that they caus'd the Foot to break their Ranks, and every One ran to the City as fast as ever he could; many were wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and taken, and, amongst them, some Captains, and Cornets of Horse.</p>
            <p>Whilst Matters were thus slowly carried on about the City, in the Country towards the North, there was a great Loss receiv'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Occasion; There were two Families, of great Power in those Parts, The <hi>Gordons</hi> and the <hi>Forbes</hi>'s; The <hi>Gordons</hi> liv'd in great Concord amongst themselves, and, by the King's Commission,<note place="margin">The Royalists receive a loss in the North, with the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of it.</note> had for many Years presided over the neighbouring Counties, and and so increas'd their ancient Power and Authority; On the other side, the <hi>Forbes</hi>'s were always at Difference, and continually weakned one another; but neither of them, had now, for many Years, made any Attempt upon the other, there being rather a secret
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:56771:369"/>
Emulation, than an open Breach, betwixt them. In the Family of the <hi>Forbes</hi>'s,<note place="margin">Deadly fewds between the <hi>Gordons</hi> and the <hi>Forbes</hi>'s.</note> there was one <hi>Arthur,</hi> a witty and an active Man, and who, from the beginning of the falling out, had always been on the King's side; he thought, 'twas <hi>then</hi> time for him to set up his own Name and his Families, and also to advance the Power of the Party, which he followed. He <hi>first</hi> then endeavour'd to reconcile All of his own Family; if he could effect that, he fear'd not any Power, that could be rais'd against him in those Parts; when a Day was appointed for that purpose, <hi>Adam Gordon,</hi> Brother to the Earl of <hi>Huntly,</hi> by all means, endeavour'd to hinder it, and therefore giving private Notice to his Friends and Vassals, there came a great Number of them to the Place. There were Two Troops of the <hi>Forbes</hi>'s in sight, but, before they could join, he set upon One of them, and kill'd <hi>Arthur</hi> presently; at his Fall, the rest were scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd, and put to flight; some eminent Men were slain, many were taken, the rest, some Days after, dar'd not stir, for Fear, lest those, they had taken Prisoners, should suffer for it. And their Fear was increas'd by the burning of <hi>Alexander Forbes</hi>'s House, with his Wife, great with Child,<note place="margin">The Cruelty of the <hi>Gordons</hi> against the <hi>Forbes</hi>'s.</note> his Children and Servants, in it. <hi>Arthur Forbes</hi>'s Elder Brother, who was the Chief of the Sept, after his House was taken and plunder'd, hardly escapt and came to Court; there, tho they were somewhat straitned themselves, yet there were 200 Foot granted to him, and to the Nobles that follow'd his Party; and withal, Letters were written to the neighbour-Nobility to join with him: When they were thus join'd with the rest of the <hi>Forbes</hi>'s, and some near Families, they thought themselves secure enough from Force, but they wanted a Chief Commander over them, for the Heads of the Families were most young Men, and there was scarce One more eminent than another amongst them: So that, they being unresolv'd in their Counsels, <hi>Iohn Keith,</hi> with 500 Horse went home to his own House, which was not far distant. <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Forbes,</hi> and his Vassals, with 200 Foot march'd to <hi>Aberdeen</hi> to drive <hi>Adam Gordon</hi> from thence, and to refresh his Men after their March. <hi>Adam</hi> receiving intelligence, that his Enemy was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing with but a small Party, draws his Men out of the Town, and, to make a show of a greater Multitude, compell'd the Towns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to draw forth with them, so that there was a sharp Conflict in the Field near the Town. The King's Foot, out of eagerness to fight, followed the <hi>Gordonians</hi> too far, and, having no Reserves, were repuls'd and put to flight,<note place="margin">The King's Party over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown.</note> principally by the Archers, there were not many of them kill'd, because the fight lasted till dark Night, but several were taken, and, amongst them, <hi>Alexander Forbes</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, after he had stoutly defended himself against them, a long time.</p>
            <p>This Success in the North did mightily incourage the Rebels, to attempt greater Matters: Whereupon, in a different Part of the Country, they resolv'd to attaque <note place="margin">The chief Town of <hi>Tevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otdale</hi> standing on the River <hi>Ied,</hi> near where it fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth into the River <hi>Teviot.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Iedburgh,</hi> a Town, as the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Custom was, unfortifi'd; but the Inhabitants were very Vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, and, some Years before, had stoutly resisted the Rebels; <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Carr</hi> of <hi>Farnihest,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Scot,</hi> liv'd near the Town; They, besides their old Clans, which were Numerous enough, had
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:56771:369"/>
associated to them, the Three neighbour Countries, <hi>Liddisdale, Ewes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale,</hi> and <hi>Eskdale,</hi> Places always given to Robbery; but then, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the Licentiousness of the Civil War, they rang'd for Booty, uncontrolably, even a great way off. And besides, in <hi>Teviotdale</hi> it self, there were some great Families noted for Robbing and Pillaging, either, being infected by their Neighbours; or, because they had been customably used to drive Preys out of their Enemies Country; neither did They only come in, but some of the neighbouring <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,</hi> in hopes of Booty, join'd themselves with them; and besides, they sent for 120 Musqueteers from <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> select Men, out of all the Foot Companies. The <hi>Iedburgians</hi> knew,<note place="margin">The Rebels at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt <hi>Ied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi>
               </note> that They were aim'd at, and therefore they sent in haste to the Regent, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint him with their Danger; they only desir'd a few light harnas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Souldiers from him; In the mean time, they were not wanting to do their best. They sent for <hi>Walter Carr</hi> of <hi>Sesford,</hi> and levy'd a reasonable Number of Souldiers out of the Neighbourhood, and fortifi'd their Town, as the time would permit: Both Parties were also inform'd, at the same time, that <hi>William Ruven</hi> was come as far as <note n="*" place="margin">An Abby in <hi>Teviotdale,</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Driburgh,</hi> with 120 Horse and Foot, Part of which he had brought with him, and Part he rais'd in the neighbour-County of <hi>Merch.</hi> But the Rebels, being confident of their Number, as being 3000 Men, march'd to the Town early in the Morning, to prevent the Coming in of their Relief; <hi>Ruven</hi> suspected, they would do so, and therefore march'd speedily after them, and made some Attempts upon their Rear. And moreover, <hi>Walter Carr</hi> join'd the Townsmen to his Souldiers, and drew forth directly towards the Enemy. They, seeing This, that they might not be enclos'd before and behind, too, presently retreated to Places of greater Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. The Robbers, or Tories,<note place="margin">But are driven back to <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi> where they are Rout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> who came in for Hopes of plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, seeing the Town fortifi'd, and the Royalists ready for the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, return'd the nearest Way they could to their Own-homes; and the Rebels, with their Vassals, and a Company of Foot, retreat to <note n="*" place="margin">A Town in <hi>Teviotdale.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Hawick,</hi> never thinking, that the Enemy would, in the least, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt any thing against them, there; and their Hopes were increas'd by the Winter-season, which was sharper than ordinary by reason of a great Quantity of Snow lately fallen, which cover'd all the Ground. But <hi>Ruven</hi> intended to make use of the Opportunity, and, in the third Watch, drew out his Party, and march'd so speedily towards <hi>Hawick,</hi> that he was in a Mile of it, before the Enemy took the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larum; They at <hi>Hawick</hi> were so amaz'd, that there was no room for Counsel left, but Foot and Horse were immediately drawn out, and following the Current of the next River, endeavour'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat to a Place of more Safety. But the Swiftness of their Pursuers prevented them; the Horse knew the Country, and made a shift to escape, but the Foot were left for a Prey; they possest themselves of a small Wood on a Rock, near the River, there they were sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded by the Horse, and not adventuring to stay till the Foot came up, they all surrendred themselves at Mercy; But seeing that other Dangers were to be prevented, and they could not be carried up and down in so sharp a Winter, having past their Words to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn at an appointed Day, and leaving some Hostages to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:56771:370"/>
they were sent home, without their Arms: When they were discharged, <hi>Kircade</hi> made sleeveless Pretences, to elude their Promises, and so hinder'd them from returning, at the time appointed.</p>
            <p>The rest of the Winter, and the following Spring, was wholly spent in light Skirmishes, wherein Few fell, but more of the Rebels than Royalists; For the Rebels, when they saw an Advantage, would draw out on the Hills near the City, and, before they had scarce begun a skirmish, would retire, sometimes, again in to the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. In the interim, frequent Embassies came from <hi>England,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile the Factions, but without effect; For the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> tho she most favour'd the King's Party, yet she was willing <hi>so</hi> to make Peace, as to ingage both Parties to her; but the <hi>French</hi> were wholly inclin'd to the Queen's Cause, and therefore, by large Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, hindred Peace, and advis'd to continue the War: Some Mony they sent at present, not enough to do the Business, but only to feed Hope, and a great Part of what was sent was still nibbled away by those that brought it. In the mean time, light Skirmishes past for some Months betwixt the Parties, but not at all contributing to the main Chance. Neither were other Parts of the Kingdom free from Plunderings,<note place="margin">A Barony up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Water of <hi>Bervy</hi> in <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus.</hi>
