         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Vlly</hi> (the glorie of the ancient <hi>Rome)</hi> defineth the hiſtorie to be a witneſſe of time, and a remembrance of things that are paſt; this is to ſay ſomewhat, but not enough. For it is a witneſſe and record of the execution of Gods iustice in reuenging the corrupt iudgements, vncleane affections, and wicked deedes of men, and of Gods good will and fatherly goodnes in defending, deliuering, and rewarding the iuſt. Therefore (Chriſtian Reader) I haue to warne thee of three things; of the vſe, order, and locution of this hiſtorie: deſiring thee to reade this, not onely to delight thine affection in ſeeing this man doo proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly and commended for his proweſſe and vertue, and another diſpraiſed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the deſert of his actions; but ſpecially to conſider the preſence of God in gouerning the one, and prospering him, in doing profitable things for the defence of a iuſt cauſe and his countrey: and the iudgement of God, which according to the threatnings of his law, doth leade the wicked to puniſhment: if not at all times and after all ill actions, yet moſt commonly and at length, alwaies doth make him ſwallow downe the dregges of his wrath. Feare there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and keepe thy ſelfe within the bounds of that vocation, which the lawe of God hath preſcribed thee.</p>
            <p>The greateſt part of this Historie is tranſlated out of French, which was ſet foorth concerning theſe affayres of the holy League, encreaſed much out of the ſeedes of actions, diſperſed in the declarations, edicts, proſcriptions, apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, aduertiſements, agreements, articles and letters written by the Kings <hi>Henry</hi> the iij. and iiij. now raigning, and other noble men acquainted with the publique affayres and estate.</p>
            <p>The latter part of the Historie, to wit, from the death of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, is a gathering of ſuch euents as haue been publiſhed from time to time. And as for the distreſſing of <hi>Paris,</hi> and the horrible famine there, I haue for the moſt part followed the report of <hi>Pedro Corneio</hi> a Spanyard, which was then in the citie during the ſiege thereof, which doth report it after a more incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible ſort then I dare lay downe.</p>
            <p>Of ſuch things which I doo ſuspect, I doo note the vncertaintie thereof by
<pb facs="tcp:8966:5"/>
the word of report, following therein that famous Hiſtoriographer of our time <hi>Iohn Sleyden.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I haue written this Historie in forme of Annales, reducing the actions of euery ſeuerall yeare into a ſundrie booke, ſaue onely the firſt, which is a colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the ſecret practiſes of many yeres, to bring that ſtate to that confuſion which we ſee it now. The new Popiſh Kalender hath brought ſome diuerſitie in the date of dayes, moneths and yeares, ſome following one Kalender, and ſome another: yet I haue reduced it to the old ſo farre as I could do it.</p>
            <p>Foraſmuch as the rebellion of the holy League is the greateſt conspiracie that euer was heard of againſt all Christian Kings and Princes, threatning all of bondage and ſubuerſion, and firſt put in vre in the kingdome of <hi>France,</hi> as moſt fit to receaue the ſame, by reaſon of the diſſentions long co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued there, wrought by the vileſt men and meanes that euer were heard of, hauing at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted &amp; atchieued moſt haynous &amp; outragious murthers, I haue thought good to decke the parties with titles and ornaments fit for ſuch deedes, to wit, with ſharpe words to expreſſe more effectually the greatnes of the offences, proteſting not to touch the noble families of Chriſtendome, whom I reuerence, but the degenerating of them, who hauing put aſide the robes of true Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, are become ſlaues of all treacheries and rebellions, and haue clothed them ſelues with diſhonour and infamie: to the end that the Christian reader may by the ſignification of grieuous Epithetes, comprehend the greatnes of ſuch tranſgreſſions as doo boyle in ſuch men, and learne to auoyde the ſocietie of all damned congregations of <hi>Corah, Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram.</hi>

M. Franks. He began to growe vnder King <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt, by crouching and capping and double diligence: vnder whom, after that all offices had béen beſtowed, hée obtained to bée the Kings Faulkner, at the ſuite of other Noble men. That was an office giuen before that time to Gentlemen of ſmall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt. Notwithſtanding y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> baſenes of his degree in Court, he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden with a ſuſpicious eye by King <hi>Francis,</hi> carying in his mind a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine preſage of that which hath happened afterward. For when he had marked with a wiſe prudencie the ſawcines of him and his children, hee vttered his iudgement concerning them in theſe words; <hi>That they will turne his children into their doublets, and his ſubiects into their ſhirts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The yeare 1515. in the abſence of the Duke of <hi>Guelders,</hi> he had the charge of the <hi>Swizzers,</hi> which King <hi>Francis</hi> had hyred for his iourney to <hi>Millaine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The yeare 1523. the Lord <hi>Trimouille</hi> left him the gouernment of <hi>Burgondie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The yeare 1527. at the ſuite and interceſſion of Noble men, the King erected his Village of <hi>Guize,</hi> ſituated vppon the riuer <hi>Oyſe</hi> in the confines of <hi>

               <p>His Children were the Dukes of <hi>Guize, Aumale,</hi> the Marquiſe <hi>D'albeuf,</hi> the two Maſſing Prieſts of <hi>Lorraine</hi> and <hi>Guize.</hi>

Theſe Faulkners did ſo apply their buſines, partly with flattering, partly with the aliance of <hi>lagrand Seneſchal,</hi> which was the Paramour of King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond, and the Duke <hi>D' Aumale</hi> maried her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as good as the mother, but eſpecially by the facilitie, or rather fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the ſaide <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond, that within fewe yeares they obtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in land and penſions one milion of Frankes, beſide their Ciuill and Eccleſiaſticall offices, dignities &amp; liuings, which did amount to ſo much. But ſpecially they aduaunced themſelues greatly in the time of King <hi>Francis</hi> the ſecond, by reaſon of their aliance with him, who had married their Néece the Quéene of <hi>Scots.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In his time they diſpoſed of all things after their owne willes. For the King ſawe nothing but by their eyes, heard nothing but by their mouthes, did nothing but by their hands; ſo that there remained no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but onely the wearing of the Crowne vpon their owne heads, and the name of King.</p>
               <p>In this great proſperitie they lacked nothing, neither will nor meanes to attaine to their intent, but that the Nobilitie of <hi>France</hi> was a perilous blocke in their way, which they could not lep ouer, for to aſcende to ſo great and high ſeate of Maieſtie, and in ſtead of a veluet cap to weare a Crowne of pure gold.</p>
               <p>In this proſperous ſucceſſe it hath happened to them as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe is, <hi>Set a begger on horſebacke, and he will ride vntill he breake his necke:</hi> which the tragicall end of them hath verified.</p>
               <p>But they fearing no ſuch bloodie euents, and intending to turne their maſter out of the houſe, and to ſeaze on the poſſeſſion, and to lodge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues therein, they vſed cunning and policie.</p>
               <p>The firſt ſteppe to reach to that which they intended to get, was a dreame in this Iulling of Fortune, vnaccuſtomed to them or theirs. For they in their dreame, dreamed and ſawe in a viſion, that they were deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended from <hi>Charles</hi> the great, and conſequently that they had right to the Crowne, and that <hi>Capet</hi> (who had diſpoſſeſſed their aunceſtors) (as they ſay) and his poſteritie, which now enioy it, are but vſurpers.</p>
               <p>But conſidering that to enter into any action of law about ſuch a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, would be a dangerous courſe, and that a peaceable ſtate would rather helpe them backward, than forward; and that ſuch a fiſh would bee caught rather in a troubleſome, than in a cleare water, the ſtreame muſt needes be ſtirred.</p>
               <p>The occaſion of the time fell out fitly to further their intent, and to trouble the ſtate: They therefore tooke the diſſenſion of Religion to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour the ſame: (than the which they thought no better could be deuiſed) for the people was alreadie in ielouſie one againſt another through the diuerſitie of religion. Unto this opportunitie came many helping cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:8966:6"/>
as the minoritie of the houſe of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>aloys,</hi> the ambition and atheiſme of the <hi>Q. Mother,</hi> the great credite and power which the parties them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues had gotten alreadie afore hand in the Realme: the facilitie or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inconſtancie of <hi>Anthonie</hi> of <hi>Burbon</hi> King of <hi>Nauarre:</hi> and laſt of all, the headie frowardnes of the Conſtable, and <hi>Annas</hi> of <hi>Monmoren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy:</hi> which things conſpiring together fitly to further their deſires, they thought it was time in ſtead of Atheiſme to put on Popiſh ſuperſtition, and their ambition ſhould runne for burning zeale of Poperie. This part they tooke not for any religion which they cared for, but being the ſtronger and more fauourable ſide, by the which they might get both cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite and ſtrength.</p>
               <p>By theſe meanes the ciuil warres being eaſily ſtirred vp, they thought all by one meane both to weaken the Nobilitie, and to oppreſſe the houſe of <hi>Burbon;</hi> which being made away, they ſuppoſed either that they could eaſily ſubuert the houſe of <hi>Valoys,</hi> being all children: or els to ſuruiue them, and as then to make an open claime to the Crowne.</p>
               <p>The ciuill warres being by them and their meanes begun, they haue entertained them from time to time. And when through wearines or weakenes of their part they haue come to peace, they haue through trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherie ſo manured it, that peace hath been more domageable to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of the Goſpell, than open warre; as it may appeare by the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers which they procured and performed at <hi>Paris,</hi> and in other Cities in <hi>France</hi> the yeare 1572.</p>
               <p>After the which murther, they alſo procured King <hi>Charles</hi> the ix. to impriſon the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and afterward <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur</hi> the Kings yongeſt brother.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> hauing béen kept priſoner with a garde the ſpace of thrée yeares and more, at length in the yeare 1576. went foorth out of <hi>Paris</hi> to hunting in the Forreſt of S. <hi>Germayne en faye,</hi> accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with a great number of Catholike Gentlemen, among whom was alſo the Duke <hi>Espernon.</hi> When he came to the Forreſt hee opened his minde vnto them that hee was not determined to returne to the Court. The Gentlemen conſidering his hard intertainement, and the greatnes of his perſon, were ſo farr from compelling him to returne from whence he came, that they profered to conduct him whereſoeuer he would, and ſo they brought him to the Towne of <hi>Alenſon 45.</hi> leagues from <hi>Paris,</hi> where was a great number of them of the reformed Religion, whether alſo he had requeſted the Gentlemen to accompanie him.</p>
               <p>Shortly after his arriuing there, when the reformed Church had aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled together, the ſaid King in the face of the ſaid congregation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed that for feare of death he had conſented to the abominations of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie, and with many teares very feruently prayed to God to forgiue
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:8966:7"/>
him, exhorted the Church to take heede, not to followe his frailtie, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them not to be offended with his fall, and with an earneſt inuocation of Gods moſt holy ſpirit, promiſed euer hereafter (by Gods grace) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie and ſtedfaſtnes in the confeſſion of the trueth.</p>
               <p>After a long and wofull warre (the particular accidents whereof I here omit, as haſtening to my purpoſe, and referre the reader in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1576"/> to ſuch treatiſes as are of purpoſe written concerning thoſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters) at length a peace was concluded about the 27. of Iuly 1576. which was ſworne vpon by the King, by the King of <hi>Nauarre, Monſieur</hi> the Kings onely brother, the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and <hi>Caſimire,</hi> &amp; other Nobles with the lifting vp of their hands.</p>
               <p>The King, to wit, <hi>Henry</hi> the 3. to ſhew how well pleaſed he was with this peace, willed and commanded, that it ſhould bee called his peace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had graunted it with his owne will and proper motion.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> then had not onely a iuſt cauſe, but alſo oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie to complaine of diuers iniuries done vnto him, at and after the murther of <hi>Paris,</hi> and alſo to demaund amends for his great loſſes, yet he neuer mooued one word, leaſt by any priuate commodities of his owne, the peace ſhould haue béen hindered.</p>
               <p>By that concluſion of peace the King graunted eight Townes (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide them which they held before) vnto them of the reformed religion, to bee gouerned vnder his obedience by the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> for the ſpace of ſixe yeares. It was agreed alſo at the requeſt of the reformed religion, that the King ſhould call the States of the Realme, to confirme this peace, and to reſtore the ancient dignitie of that kingdome.</p>
               <p>Theſe States were ſo cunningly handled, that it did almoſt fall to the vtter vndoing of them of the religion. For the <hi>Guizes,</hi> with the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion of the King, made ſuch meanes as none other might be admitted to the ſame States, than the profeſſed enemies of the Goſpell. For they cauſed conuocations to bee aſſembled in the ſeuerall Prouinces, who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted ſuch, as were farre from peace, with ſecret inſtructions to bee preſented at the ſaide States, without making the Townes, Cities, or Commonalties priuie to the ſame.</p>
               <p>They alſo cauſed infamous Libels to be printed and propoſed in their ſeuerall conuocations, denouncing open warre vnto them of the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med religion, and vnto all that would not conſent to the vndoing of them. Furthermore, they deuiſed alſo the meanes to interrupt that peace, which of late concluded by their conſent, and yet ſo politickly, that the cauſes ſhould not bee founde in themſelues, but in the profeſſors of the Goſpell. For they procured infinite iniuries and violences to be done vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them of the Religion by their partakers, hoping that through diſpaire and impatiencie they would breake the peace, and ſo the King would
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:8966:7"/>
arme the Duke of <hi>Guize</hi> againſt them, that in the meane time hauing the Kings power in hand, he might growe in authoritie, and the King <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1576"/> decreaſe.</p>
               <p>Immediatly after the concluſion of peace made, the <hi>Guizes</hi> perceiuing that theſe three noble Princes had auoyded their clawes, (for the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> was gone into his kingdome, the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> had auoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into <hi>Germanie,</hi> &amp; <hi>Monſieur</hi> had bin ſet at libertie) without any hope to bring them againe within their reach, and that not onely they were a terror, but alſo would be great lets to their drifts, and that they were able to cut them out more worke, than they would be able to patch as long as they ſhould liue, conſidering the name, roome, authoritie and power that they were of, both in <hi>France</hi> and with forraine Nations: To the ende that at the States appoynted they might oppreſſe theſe Princes, with the reſt of the Nobilitie which would not take part with them; to ground a ſure foundation vpon a ſtrong Councell, then ſent they their agent the Biſhop of <hi>Paris,</hi> and the aduocate <hi>Dauid</hi> (a worſe man did not liue then vpon the earth) to <hi>Rome</hi> the holy Citie, to take good aduiſe and ſpiritual counſell of their ghoſtly father.</p>
               <p>The Biſhop of <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Dauid</hi> with him came to <hi>Rome,</hi> the Schoole of all murthers, treaſons, poyſonings and ſlaughters, againſt all the Princes and States of Chriſtendome.

               <p>There was great complaints framed againſt the King, <hi>Monſieur</hi> his brother, the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> againſt all the houſe of <hi>Burbon,</hi> and the Nobilitie of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> were heretickes and relapſe. The King and his brother, with a great number of the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, if they were not heretickes, yet were they fauourers of heretickes, they cauſed hereſies to grow and to take roote, by making peace with he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retickes, to the vtter ouerthrowe of holy Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And that it was high time that <hi>Sir Hugh</hi> (Vicar of <hi>Rome)</hi> ſhould prouide for ſome ſpeedie remedie to preuent the miſchiefe.</p>
               <p>There it was ſhewed (to render the King and all the Princes odious) how the houſe of <hi>Capet</hi> had alwaies withſtood the holy Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that they had ſupported in old time the <hi>Valdenſes</hi> and <hi>Albigeoys,</hi> and now that either they are ioyned with the <hi>Hugonets,</hi> or els are fauourers of them.</p>
               <p>But on the contrary ſide, the houſe of <hi>Charles</hi> the great (which was wrongfully diſpoſſeſſed of the Crowne) by the Papall bleſſing, had a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall grace giuen them to helpe holy Church, and had left yet ſome luſtie

buds, which are they of the houſe of <hi>Guize,</hi> in whom is all the hope of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Church, to roote out the hereticks, and to reſtore all things. The fable of this Popiſh bleſſing heere aboue mentioned, is in the Chronicles of <hi>Rhegimon</hi> a Monke of S. <hi>Benet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the time of <hi>Pipin</hi> father to <hi>Charles</hi> the great, <hi>Stephen</hi> Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> being a factious and turbulent man, through his ambition did trouble <hi>Italy.</hi> And when <hi>Arſtulphe</hi> King of the <hi>Lombards</hi> (a nation not vſed to bee controulled by Prieſts) went about to chaſtize him, fled into <hi>France,</hi> to ſtirre <hi>Pipin</hi> (which a fewe yeares before had vſurped the Crowne of <hi>France</hi> by the helpe of Pope <hi>Zachary)</hi> againſt the ſayd <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulphe.</hi> This Pope being at S. <hi>Denis</hi> nigh <hi>Paris,</hi> fell brainſicke, and in his ſicknes the diuell deluded him with an entuſiaſme, making him to ſee in a viſion <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paule</hi> before the high Altar in their Surpleſſes, by the which (as he ſayd) he knewe them. Then came in S. <hi>Denis</hi> with a leane face, hauing a Cenſor in his hand, whom <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paule</hi> ſent to the ſayd <hi>Stephen</hi> to heale him, who charged him to hallowe the ſayd Church. Pope <hi>Stephen</hi> could this viſion to them which were preſent there, and being about to riſe out of his bed to doo what he was comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, they ſayd vnto him that he doated. But after he had told this follie to <hi>Pipin,</hi> the 13. of Auguſt 753. he annoynted <hi>Pipin</hi> King of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Berte,</hi> and with his Popiſh bleſſing ſanctified all the Barons &amp; Nobles of <hi>France,</hi> binding them with an oath neuer to chooſe King of <hi>France</hi> but of that raſe of <hi>Pipin.</hi> Thus goeth the ſottiſh fable of the brainſicke en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuſiaſme Pope <hi>Stephen.</hi> The <hi>Guizes</hi> fayning to haue deſcended out of that raſe by the helpe of this fable, beſides the determinations, ſet downe concerning other States of Chriſtendome, it was concerning <hi>Fraunce</hi> thus decreed.

               <p n="4">4 In the meane time the King ſhall goe from <hi>Paris</hi> into a place of ſure acceſſe, and voide of ſuſpition, where he ſhall entiſe by fayre promiſes, by fayre meanes and fayre words, the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de,</hi> if it may be done; whom he ſhall receiue with as much entertainment and courteſie, as he may ſhewe them.

               <p>But now to ſpeake in ſadneſſe, by theſe inſtructions, according to the which all the ciuill warres haue been directed euer ſince the yeare 1576. vntill the death of the laſt Duke of <hi>Guize,</hi> we may iudge what wiſedome and bleſſings are to be expected from <hi>Sir Hugh</hi> and his Chaplaines.</p>
               <p>Whileſt theſe things were at working in <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>Guizes</hi> followed diuers wayes to interrupt the peace: but now by the returne of <hi>Dauid</hi> from <hi>Rome,</hi> with theſe aforeſaide inſtructions, they went to worke ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially, and by the colluſion of the King, they made ſuch meanes as none might be admitted to the States, but the profeſſed enemies of the reformed Churches. For they cauſed priuate conuocations to be aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in the ſeuerall Prouinces, which appoynted ſuch as were farre from peace, &amp; were of the conſpiracie of <hi>Guize,</hi> hauing their ſecret inſtructions to be preſented at the States, without making priuie to their counſels any Townes, Cities or Commonalties.</p>
               <p>They ſpread abroad, that the Edict of peace could not bee publiſhed nor admitted in Townes and Cities, than the which nothing was more deſired of all ſorts of men, except onely them of the conſpiracie.</p>
               <p>They cauſed alſo infamous Libels to be printed and propoſed in their ſeuerall conuocations, being of ſuch men, as knowing the reports to bee moſt falſe, yet were readie to make themſelues to be true. As that they of the reformed religion requeſted the exercize of the ſame, not for ſatiſfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or contenting of their conſciences, but for the maintenance of factious and practizes againſt the King, and to fortifie themſelues, that vpon op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie, they might ſhake off the yoke of obedience due to the King.</p>
               <p>They ſpread abroad alſo, that they of the reformed religion had ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized <hi>Lachorite,</hi> and many Townes and Forts in <hi>Poytow, Xainctonge, Guyen, Languedock,</hi> and <hi>Daulphine,</hi> and that they had committed ſundry
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:8966:10"/>
murthers and cruelties vppon the Catholikes, and therefore in the ſame aſſemblies they did denounce warre vnto them of the reformed religion, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1577"/> and to all them which would not conſent to their vndoing.</p>
               <p>They procured infinite number of iniuries and violences to bee done by their partakers euery where, to them of the religion, hoping through impatience, to cauſe them to breake the Edict of peace, ſo that the cauſes being found in them, the King arming the Duke of <hi>Guize,</hi> ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe his ſecret enemies authoritie, and decay his owne.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding theſe manifolde iniuries proffered vnto them of the religion, and the breaking of the peace, they of their part obſerued the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict of pacification, without moleſting the Catholikes, but ſtoode onely vpon the defenſiue.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Guizes</hi> haſting ſo much as euer they could, their enterprizes (by their partakers) procured many Townes and Prouinces to rebell and to breake the peace, pretending that they of the religion ſought the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the Cleargie.</p>
               <p>Beſides the practizes afore mentioned, theſe good huſbands being loth to leaue any ſtone vnſtirred, that happily might any way further their deuiſed plot, did not ſticke to attempt euen contrary meanes. For in like caſe they followed the olde tricke of <hi>Barcocab,</hi> they went about cloſely and vnder hand, to drawe into their League them of the reformed religion, promiſing them the exercize of their religion, according to the Edict of peace, and more if they would.</p>
               <p>They ſolicited alſo <hi>Iohn Caſimier</hi> Prince <hi>Palſgraue</hi> to enter in league with them, promiſing to doo nothing againſt the reformed religion, and to deliuer him Townes in their gouernments for pledges. And herein if they could haue effected their deſire happily, they would not haue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ſo rigorous a courſe againſt them of the reformed religion, as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward they did, when they perceiued that they of the reformed religion did ſmell, detect, and abhorred their treacherous ambition, and that they were taken <hi>forbeu cozba.</hi> If they might haue preuailed with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, they would haue ſtoode vppon ſome plauſible Common-wealth. For their intent herein was (not that they cared or regarded any religion) but to bring the King and the Princes of the bloud into hatred, and the people into a miſtiking of the gouernement.</p>
               <p>And ſeeing their offers were reiected by the reformed, they determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to roote them out, aſſuring themſelues generally of the Catholikes, vnder colour of zeale of Poperie which they fayned more and more.</p>
               <p>And to begin, the <hi>Q. Mother</hi> (according to the Goſpell brought from <hi>Rome</hi> by <hi>Dauid,</hi> as is aboue ſayd) was ſent to bring <hi>Monſier</hi> her ſonne to the States at <hi>Bloys,</hi> which ſhe performed.</p>

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:8966:10"/>
ſore threatnings were vttered, either to entice, or els to enforce the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> to the States at <hi>Bloys.</hi> But <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1577"/> they refuſed their companie, knowing well what their meaning was. During this time, they were very buſie to make Leagues and confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies, and to erect euery where fraternities, which they called of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, by ſuch meanes to fortifie themſelues, as they pretended, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Heretickes, but indeede to conſpire the ſubuerſion both of the King and of the <hi>Burbons,</hi> which could not bee done (as they thought) without the rooting out of the profeſſors of the reformed religion.</p>
               <p>The ſecret Councell of <hi>Rome</hi> could not bee kept ſo cloſe, but that the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> had intelligences what was paſſed at <hi>Rome,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſendeth a Gentleman of his to the King, with remembrances to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſe him of the conſpiracie already concluded at <hi>Rome,</hi> againſt him and his eſtate. <hi>Monſieur</hi> his brother in like manner informed him, that there were things paſſed at <hi>Rome,</hi> againſt him, his Crowne and ſtate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iohn Caſimier</hi> Prince palatine out of <hi>Germany,</hi> ſendeth in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner aduertiſements vnto the King about the ſame matter: and beſides by <hi>Praillon</hi> giueth him notice of the drifts of the Leaguers, which were to let the free holding of the States, by corrupting of the Deputies, and by letting that none of the Princes of the bloud, or any that haue cauſe of complayning, might appeare with free acceſſe.</p>
               <p>Thus the <hi>Guizes</hi> furthering their buſines by all meanes (as is aboue ſayd) in the Prouinces, for the making of a ſtrong league with as many as they were able, they procured the towne of <hi>Montmarſan</hi> in <hi>Gaſcoyne,</hi> to rebell againſt the King of <hi>Nauarre:</hi> which he ſhortly after ſurprized in one night, and brought the inhabitants to their duetie without any bloud ſhedding.</p>

               <p>Vnto this meſſage the Prince <hi>Caſimier</hi> anſwered, as ſhewing how <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Ianuary"/> the King was abuſed by the States, which were none other but ſuch as were enemies of his eſtate, and perturbers of the peace vnder the name of the States: and laſtly willeth him not to caſt his Realme into a miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable flame of ciuill warres for other mens pleaſure.</p>
               <p>The Prince <hi>Caſimier</hi> alſo ſendeth <hi>Butrich</hi> his Ambaſſador to the King, to perſwade him (if poſſible were) to entertaine the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The 7. of March enſuing, the ſayd <hi>Butrich</hi> Ambaſſador, ſurrendred in his Maſters name, the lands, Lordſhips, penſions and offices which the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="March"/> King had giuen him at the concluding of the peace. For as much as the <hi>Guizes</hi> had ſpread abroad both through <hi>France, Germany,</hi> and other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, that the ſaid Prince (in conſideration and reſpect of his particular profite) was preiudiciall to the publike commoditie of his Souldiers.</p>
               <p>The pariſh Prieſts about this time tooke the names of able men; Souldiers were euery where ſecretly muſtered, according to <hi>Sir Hugh</hi> his counſell, as is aforeſaid. The Ieſuits alſo began to take the matter in hande, to further conſpiracies by rayling Sermons, who by theſe meaues crept ſo deepely into the Kings fauour, that he preferred the ſawcieſt of them, and them who could thunder moſt furiouſly againſt the reformed religion, to Biſhoprickes, Abbeyes, Prebends, and other fat Benefices; nouriſhing in his boſome from time to time the firebrands, to ſet him and his Realme in combuſtion at the firſt opportunitie.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Guizes</hi> ſeeing they could not win them of the religion to fauour their doings, but rather that their agents were taken <hi>forbeu cozba,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering alſo that they were not able to haue their deſire vpon them, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring greatly the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> whoſe wiſedome, vertue, and valour they knewe well, goe about to make him to ſome hatefull, and to others contemptible. Therefore the Admirall <hi>Villars,</hi> father in lawe to the Duke <hi>de Mayne,</hi> raiſed vp vpon him the old lye and flander reported of the Chriſtians of the Primitiue Church, vp the Pagans, (to the end that Sathan might bee like to himſelfe) to wit, that the ſayd King being at <hi>Agen,</hi> in the night, the candles ſhould be put out. That falſe report was ſpread abroad throughout <hi>France,</hi> afore that any man had heard of it in the Citie of <hi>Agen.</hi> It was alſo reprooued for a moſt falſe lye by many Noblemen and Ladies of both religions which were then preſent.</p>
               <p>Now, the concluſion or rather colluſion of the States, was that they required the Edict of peace to bee reuoked, the exercize of the reformed religion inhibited, and Poperie to be ſet vp euery where.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:8966:11"/>
The King was as deſirous to graunt them, as they to require the breach of the peace: wherevpon fearefull perſecutions were raiſed vp e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1578"/> where; great cruelties effected in diuers places vpon them of the religion, and open warre denounced.</p>
               <p>And for as much as the condemnation and execution of <hi>Monſieur</hi> could not be brought to paſſe as yet, for many co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiderations, it was kept cloſe, and deferred to a fitter time. But ſpecially for that he might be a good inſtrument to be occupied againſt the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> and them of the reformed religion.</p>
               <p>Therefore they thought good to make him and the Duke of <hi>Guize</hi> Generall ouer the Kings forces. Him I ſay, to giue the more authoritie to the actions and enterprizes with greater terror. The other was ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Commiſſion to preuent what might happen, that <hi>Monſieur</hi> ſhould not in any wiſe fauour the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> nor his partakers any whit at all.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> hauing ſuch power as he could make in <hi>Guyen,</hi> prepared himſelfe vppon the defenſiue; and hauing a mightie power of <hi>Germaines</hi> readie to enter into <hi>France,</hi> his enemies hearts were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what cooled, and began to faint.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, the King wanting money, nothing was done. By this expedition, &amp; a great terror of the <hi>Germaines,</hi> hauing ſeazed <hi>France,</hi> the King now ſheweth himſelfe as deſirous of peace, as he was not long before of warre, and ſendeth his Mother to the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> to treat for peace. Now old <hi>Catie</hi> muſt ſhewe ſome Italian iuggling, or els fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well Poperie. After much chopping and chaunging of words, the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine was made. The King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> being at <hi>Nerack</hi> in <hi>Gaſcoyne,</hi> receiued the peace, with ſome reſtructions of the former Edict, abhorring the ſlaughters of the Nobilitie, and oppreſſions of the people.</p>
               <p>This peace being concluded at <hi>Nerack,</hi> the <hi>Guizes</hi> tooke it very grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſly, as vnprofitable for the aduancing of that myſterie which did lye hidden in their braine: and alſo for that the King went about to reforme many abuſes, brought in by warre, and to reſtore the Nobilitie, to eaſe the people of diuers charges. For the <hi>Guizes</hi> would haue all theſe abuſes to continue, that in time it might ſerue for an olde cloake to couer withall their treacherous drifts, as they did afterward at the riſing of them in armes 1585. Diffidence and iealouſies therefore did growe daylie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the King and the <hi>Guizes.</hi> But the King to obtaine his intended purpoſe, thought good to pacifie them, calleth them to the Court, dooth aſſigue them great penſions, beſtoweth great gifts and honors vppon them. Yet they hauing alwaies a hartburning, tickled with their accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed ambition, watching for the death of <hi>Monſieur,</hi> determined to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten them: foraſmuch as they feared him more than the King.</p>

The <hi>Guizes</hi> of their part were not idle, but by ſundrie practizes had renewed the ciuill warres: and by the Kings conſent <hi>Monſieur</hi> his brother and the Duke <hi>de Mayne</hi> were in Commiſſion for the conducting of the Kings Armies: which thing they did as well as they could, with as great preparations as might bée, but yet without doing any harme.

               <p>Therefore in the yeare 1580. <hi>Monſieur</hi> (before he tooke his iourney) was ſent to the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> which both met at <hi>Fleyx,</hi> a Towne in <hi>Perigord,</hi> ſituated vppon the riuer of <hi>Dradogne,</hi> where they concluded a peace, not much varying from the former.

               <p>Now this being done, Frier <hi>Mathew</hi> (the <hi>Guizes</hi> Purſiuant) of méere deuotion muſt needs poſt to <hi>Rome</hi> yet once againe to viſite the Stewes, and to aduertize <hi>Sir Hugh</hi> what was paſt in <hi>France,</hi> to knowe of him how the <hi>Guizes</hi> ſhould worke vppon this preſent occaſion.

               <p>The King ſending his brother into <hi>Brabant,</hi> determined to appoynt him a Counſell. But the Kings Counſell being in a manner all Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guers, appoynted him two manner of men, one to accompanie him, and the other to counſell him. They therefore prouided that ſuch counſell ſhould be giuen him, as either ſhould altogether nouſell him in all filthie life, or els ſhould worke ſuch meanes as might diſhonor him, or put him in danger of his life.

               <p>
                  <hi>Monſieur</hi> therefore in this equipage of men of ſo ſundrie colours and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1582"/> qualities, taketh his iourney firſt into <hi>England,</hi> and from thence into <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant</hi> the yeare 1582. there to bee inueſted of that Dukedome of the holy Empyre, which was duely and ſumptuouſly performed.</p>

To theſe and like perſwaſions the Duke of <hi>Guize</hi> was wont to anſwere, that hee will enterprize nothing openly, whileſt the King had any brother; but if he could ſee one day the laſt of the houſe of <hi>Valoys</hi> to ſit vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Throne, he promiſed them with a round oath to ſet his hand to worke ſo ſurely, that if he did not carrie away the whole, yet he hoped to haue a good part of the cake. In the meane time the <hi>Guizes</hi> began to ſell the moſt part of their offices, and to gather great ſummes of money, making their reckoning ſhortly to haue all and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of all. But thinking the time long, that neither ſicknes, nor the fortune of warre had ſhortned the life of <hi>Monſieur,</hi> which greatly they deſired, they determined to do that which God would not do, and to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute <hi>Sir Hughs</hi> ſpirituall counſell.</p>
               <p>There was one <hi>Salcedo</hi> a Spanyard, which before had eſcaped the gibbet of <hi>Roan,</hi> for coyning falſe coyne, with his falſe gold and ſiluer wrought by Alchimie, fled into <hi>Spayne,</hi> and from thence into <hi>Lorrayne,</hi> where the <hi>Guizes</hi> hiered him for ſixe thouſand Crownes (which they payed him at <hi>Nancie</hi> in <hi>Lorrayne)</hi> to murther <hi>Monſieur.</hi> This <hi>Salcedo</hi> therefore hauing his money and his leſſon without the booke, went into <hi>France,</hi> proffered his ſeruice to <hi>Monſieur</hi> afore he went into the Lowe Countrey, and at the recouerie of <hi>Cambray</hi> ſhewed ſome token of dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, and in the Low Countrey did all that could be to creepe into grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fauour with <hi>Monſieur.</hi> But withall entered in familiaritie and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication with the yongeſt ſonne of <hi>Egmond,</hi> for which cauſe the ſayd <hi>Egmond</hi> began to be ſuſpected both of <hi>Monſieur</hi> and the Prince of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renge:</hi> who being examined by the ſayd Prince about <hi>Salcedos</hi> familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, anſwered that their communications were about Alchimie.

               <p>This bleſſed Virgin therefore tooke her iourney to <hi>Monſieur</hi> ward with her holy boxes with her: ſhée was the more welcome to <hi>Monſieur,</hi> becauſe he had not ſéene her of a long time: he being otherwiſe ſomewhat penſiu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Shée came forth with her holy boxes, where holy dregges of <hi>Rome</hi> had béene, out of the which ſhe gaue him a bole ſo hard of digeſtion, that it did him no good: for it did lie ſo heauie vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his heart, that he neuer left vomitting of blood as long as there remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned life in him, and in like maner as his brother <hi>Charles</hi> the ninth did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him: he died the 10. day of Iuly, on the which day his father <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond died 24. yeares before.</p>

               <p>Whileſt Frier <hi>Mathew</hi> (carier of the <hi>Guyzes)</hi> goeth to do his meſſage as well as he could, they of the <hi>Guyze</hi> with their partakers do diſpearſe themſelues into all partes of the Realme, to allure Townes and Cities, but eſpecially them that were Malecontentes, to their deuotion: after the which progreſſe of theirs with importunacy, they do procure the King to call the aſſembly of the ſtates of the realme at <hi>Bloys,</hi> to the which they had altogether laboured their fauorers, and ſuch as did deſire nothing more then the decay of the King, and increaſing of the <hi>Guyzes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the ſame aſſembly, that the King might haue the blame himſelfe of the breaking of the peace, it was requeſted.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that the edict of pacification ſhould be reuoked, and the exerciſe of the reformed religion forbidden.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and all the nobilitie profeſſing the ſame religion, ſhould be exiled out of the realme, &amp; all others of the ſame profeſſion ſhould be enforced either to abiure, or els to depart forthwith out of the Realme.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that the 8. townes which were giuen them for 6. yeares, ſhould be put into the kinges handes, alleaging that the time was expired.</p>
               <p>The king being deſirous to entertaine his ſubiectes in peace, knowing well the frutes of ciuil warre, diſſolued the ſtates, promiſing ſhortly to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble the beſt, wiſeſt, and moſt experienced of his realme, to haue their aduiſe for the reformation of all thinges.</p>
               <p>About the ſame time of the ſtates beeing at <hi>Bloys,</hi> the king of <hi>Nauarre</hi> ſendeth new aduertiſementes to the king, about the intent and open prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes of the league, willing him to haue ſome care of himſelfe, and ſheweth him the preſent danger that he ſtood in.</p>
               <p>After the returne of Frier <hi>Mathew</hi> from <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>Barieſuits</hi> in the latter end of September held a certaine Synode or Clandeſtine conuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle in <hi>Paris,</hi> in the which the ſaid Frier <hi>Mathew</hi> as preſident, did rule the roſt, hauing receaued direction of <hi>Sir Hugh</hi> vicar of <hi>Rome,</hi> where accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſaid directions, they lay downe the methode to ſtirre vp the coles, to raiſe vp ſeditions and rebellious in all partes, but eſpecially to increaſe the hatred of all men againſt them of the religion, but namely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the king of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and for that end they forged an infamous libell, as more amply ſhalbe ſhewed.</p>
               <p>The king according to his promiſe made to the States at <hi>Bloys,</hi> in the latter end of the yeare 1584. called (at Saint <hi>Germayn</hi> in <hi>Faye)</hi> his chée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt and beſt learned Senators of all his Parliamentes, there to ſhew him the beſt and readieſt meanes to eaſe the people, and to reſtore the realme to ſome good ſtate.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, the king of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> conſidering that the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed

to ſurrender the 8. townes committed to his cuſtody, was expired, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1584"/> and that the rage of his enemies was rather increaſed then diminiſhed, and that their meanes, their factions and their furie was now greater then euer it had béene, and that imminent daungers were at hand: aſſembled a méeting of the Nobilitie, which profeſſed the reformed religion at <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taulban,</hi> a ſtrong City in <hi>Quercye,</hi> where <hi>Monſieur Belieure</hi> (one of the kinges counſaile) was preſent to prouide for their common affaires.</p>
               <p>And whereas the king of <hi>Nauarre</hi> his enemies had ſpread abroad, both by falſe rumors and libels, that immediatly after the death of <hi>Monſieur,</hi> he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Decemb."/> was returned to the Catholike religion, and was gone to Maſſe: the ſaid king of <hi>Nauarre</hi> therefore to ſatiſfy all men againſt that falſe rumor, and ſlaunder, proteſted openly that he knew the truth to be on his ſide, and that by Gods aſſiſtance he would ſtand to the profeſſion and defence of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed religion, vnto the end, and that hée would acknowledge none other fortune but onely that.</p>
               <p>There by the common aduiſe of all that aſſembly, it was thought good, that conſidering the great daungers which ſeeme to threaten them of the reformed Religion, and generally all <hi>France,</hi> a ſupplication ſhould bee preſented to the king, that of his méere fauour &amp; clemencie be would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the kéeping of the ſaid Townes to the king of <hi>Nauarre</hi> for certaine yeares more.</p>

               <p>Therefore now the <hi>Guyze</hi> is as full of Spaniſh piſtolets, as a Dogge is full of Fleas (as the Prouerbe is, when wee will ſignify great aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of thinges). He geueth great ſummes of this Spaniſh liberality to his partakers, but ſpecially to diſcontented perſons. He profereth alſo of this Spaniſh money to many, which neither require it, neither would haue of it. But all men did excéedingly wonder whence ſhould come this plenty, ſéeing that it was well knowen, that he was déepely indebted.</p>
               <p>Now when all thinges ſéemed to be in a readines, to begin the trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, the Fryers of the ſociety of <hi>Barieſe</hi> the ſorcerer, named by cutting ſhort Ieſuits, do play the prologue: for they ſteppe vp into Pulpits euery

where, whom they haue turned to trompets and drommes of the Deuill, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1585"/> to blow and ſound the alarme of ſedition and rebellion.</p>
               <p>There they do ſhew the decay of popery, which they call the Catholike faith: they do vrge the miſeries of euery degrée to procéede from the <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonoets</hi> and their fauorers (meaning and in a maner openly declaring the king.) They do propound y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great dangers which did hang ouer the heads of the Catholikes.</p>
               <p>There they did tell, how that there was a certaine confederacie of the <hi>Hugonoets</hi> with the heretikes of <hi>Germany, England, Denmarke,</hi> and <hi>Swiſſerland,</hi> to oppreſſe the Catholike Church.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid before that in September laſt, there was holden a certayne conuenticle of conſpirators againſt Chriſtendom in <hi>Paris</hi> by the <hi>Barieſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its,</hi> commonly called the <hi>Ieſuits,</hi> where they forged a certaine infamous li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell, to ſerue them for a firebrand of the ſedition.</p>
               <p>There they ſay and lye all at once, that the 14. day of December 1584, ther was concluded at <hi>Magdebourge</hi> in <hi>Saxonie,</hi> that the kings of <hi>Nauarre</hi> and <hi>Denmarke,</hi> the Queene of <hi>England,</hi> the Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> the Princes <hi>Palſgraue,</hi> and <hi>Orenge,</hi> the Landſgraue of <hi>Heſſen,</hi> they or their Embaſſadors ſhould appeare at <hi>Baſill</hi> the next moneth of May following. Where is to be noted the impudencie of theſe lying Fryers. For the Princes <hi>Palſgraue</hi> and <hi>Orenge</hi> were dead, the one a whole yeare before, the other they had procured to be murthered in <hi>Holland</hi> by one of their owne Ieſuits 6. moneths before.

               </p>
               <p>They affirmed alſo in the ſaid infamous libels, that the King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarre</hi> ſhould haue taken armes the 18. of Aprill, the yeare 1585. which in déede was the time appointed for the League to riſe vp.</p>
               <p>They affirmed alſo, that the king of <hi>Nauarre</hi> had promiſed in the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblie of <hi>Montaulban,</hi> that in caſe he ſhould ſuruiue the king, and that hée might attayne to the Crowne, he would roote out of <hi>France</hi> all Popiſh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and depriue them of the ſaid religion of all ſtate, dignity and auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
               <p>They ſaid alſo that the miniſters had perſwaded the king of <hi>Nauarre</hi> to reuenge the murther of <hi>Paris,</hi> and that it was concluded, that out of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry towne and citie 3. of the chéefeſt Burgeſes ſhould be deliuered to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite the ſaid murther.</p>
               <p>They did reade theſe forged lyes in their Pulpits, where they omitted no point of Monkiſh railing rhetoricke in their ſermons, to ſtirre vp the people to ſedition and warre againſt them of the reformed religion. They crye out, they rage and fume, ſaying that now the time is come, that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Church (for by this word they meane, the pride, pompe, and voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

They do exhort the people both in their Sermons, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1585"/> and prinate confetence, and in their ſhriuing of the people, to ioyne with the Leaguers, made them great promiſes of heauenly rewardes, they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolled the noble buds of <hi>Charlemaigne,</hi> meaning the <hi>Guyzes,</hi> which haue vndertaken the defence of holy Church againſt the force and attemptes of heretikes, and fauorers of them. They preached alſo their valure, their wiſedome, their woundes and noble feats for the defence of the realme, and holy Church. They ſhewed how eaſie it would be to roote out the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes out of all <hi>France,</hi> hauing ſuch Captaines to manage the warres.</p>
               <p>About the beginning of this yeare 1585. there was a Bachiler, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a lodger of diuinitie in <hi>Sorboune,</hi> which dyed a holy Martir in this wiſe (let good men iudge.) This Diuine had holden in diſputation pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely in the Colledge of <hi>Sorboune</hi> this Theologall propoſition, ful of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitical diuinity, which he dedicated to the Abbot of <hi>Cluny,</hi> baſtard ſonne to the Cardinall of <hi>Lorreine:</hi> that was, to wit, That it was lawfull for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man priuate or otherwiſe, to depoſe or kill any King or Prince, which were wicked, euill men, or heretikes.</p>
               <p>The king hearing of this new and ſtrange kinde of Diuinitie aryued now of late into the land, was greatly offended, and intended to call this Bachiler to accompt: but he was preuented by theſe meanes,</p>
               <p>For they which had made him ſo ſpeake with Piſtolets of <hi>Spaine,</hi> hired a good fellow likewiſe with Piſtolets, which ſlew this diuine with all his diuinity in the court of the Colledge: which act done, fled &amp; auoided, leaſt he who had ſet both of them to worke for Piſtolets ſhould be diſcloſed.</p>
               <p>Thus the Prologue being ſo well played, and the hartes of the behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders ſo prepared: the Duke of <hi>Guyze</hi> alſo with his Piſtolets hauing drawen the Malcontes to helpe to playe the reſt: and the principall Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors themſelues almoſt readie to come forth. There reſted one practiſe more to be ſet downe before the entrance, which was as followeth.</p>
               <p>Betwéene the riuers of <hi>Charante, Botonne,</hi> and the townes of <hi>Niort, Fonteney,</hi> and <hi>Ralmond,</hi> cituated vppon the Ocean ſea, lyeth a Countrey called <hi>Annix,</hi> pertaining to the gouernement of <hi>Rochel:</hi> the Riuer <hi>Seure</hi> comming downe from <hi>Niort,</hi> afore it falleth into the ſea, méeting with an other riuer running from <hi>Fontency,</hi> deuideth it ſelfe into many channels, which do make diuers Ilandes, commonly called the Ilandes of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran,</hi> by the name of the chiefe towne there called <hi>Portmaran.</hi> At euery ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe into thoſe Ilandes, there are fortes builded vpon the channels of the ſayd riuer.</p>
               <p>The third day of February the Miniſter of <hi>Maran</hi> being at <hi>Rochel,</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Febr. 3"/> was aduertiſed by the letters of a friend, that there was greater and more cruell preparation of warre againſt the reformed religion, than euer had
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:8966:17"/>
béen afore time: and alſo that there were drifts to ſeaze vpon the Iles of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1585"/> 
                  <hi>Maran,</hi> the Caſtle and other Forts, if it were not looked to. For the <hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes</hi> intending ſhortly to bring to light their intents heretofore hidden in the darknes of their brayne, and aforehand to ſeaze vpon as many places of importance as they could; determined by all meanes to ſeaze vpon <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel,</hi> which had béen alwayes a great eye-ſore to them. But knowing well that <hi>Rochel</hi> could not bee ſurprized, they hoped to bring to paſſe by warre that which could not bee done by treaſon nor ſurprize, and therefore they concluded to take theſe Ilands afore hand, out of the which they ſuppoſed greatly to moleſt, and in the end to blocke in the ſayd towne of <hi>Rochel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Guizes</hi> had purpoſed to raiſe their inſurrection the 18. of Aprill. But the ſpirit of ambition did ſo diſquiet them, that without taking any reſt they thought a day to be a yere; which impatient abiding cauſed them to abridge their time, and to anticipate from the 18. of Aprill to the 4. of March. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Mar. 4"/>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore now the <hi>Guizes</hi> Leaguers (for ſo ſhall they be called hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) with their leagued came foorth vppon the ſtage the 4. day of March, which had béen a fatall day to that houſe to worke miſchiefe. For 25. yeres <hi>Francis</hi> Duke of <hi>Guize,</hi> father vnto this laſt, vpon the ſame day commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the cruell murther of <hi>Vaſſie,</hi> which was the breach of the Edict of Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary, and the ground of all the ciuill warres which haue followed. The Leaguer and leagued (I ſay) came foorth galloping in troupes in euery part of <hi>France,</hi> but ſpecially in <hi>Normandie, Picardie, Brie, Champaigne,</hi> and about <hi>Paris.</hi> They ſeaze vpon Townes, Cities and Fortreſſes, vpon the Kings money, and vpon euery thing which might doo them good. They ſurprized <hi>Compeigne, Guyſſons, Chalons, Toul, Meziers, Montreul, Peron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,</hi> and diuers other places in diuers Prouinces.</p>
               <p>The King on the other ſide deſirous to keepe his realme in peace, with the good aduiſe of his Senators, aſſembled at S. <hi>Germaine,</hi> for a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to eaſe the people, had remitted ſeuen hundred thouſand Frankes, diſcharging alſo diuers offices, which were greatly chargeable, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull to the people, and intended to doo a great deale more hereafter, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing himſelf wholly to reſtore his realme in his former flouriſhing eſtate. But hearing of this ſudden taking of armour, at the firſt was greatly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed thereat; yet afterward did beare it with great patience, to ſee what end theſe newe tumults and attempts would come to.</p>
               <p>The 15. day of March the Leaguers being in armour, and dooing all parts of hoſtilitie vpon the Kings ſubiects, ſuppoſing that all <hi>France</hi> not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> onely would tremble at the ſound of their Trompets, but ſo would take their part, were fouly diſappoynted.

And among all others which miſſed of their purpoſe, <hi>Monſieur des Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi> according to the determination of the Leaguers, (as is aforeſayd) <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1585"/> ſent to <hi>Maran</hi> a certaine friend of his named <hi>Gareune</hi> (who heretofore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="March"/> in the former warres had commanded there vnder the ſaid <hi>Monſieur des Roches)</hi> to ſeaze vpon the Caſtle, with the helpe of fiue Souldiers diſgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in Marchants apparell, whom he had brought with him, hoping there alſo to haue the helpe of certaine Papiſts of the Towne, but ſpecially of him who had the Caſtle in kéeping named <hi>Piguard,</hi> a Popiſh ſouldier, which in times paſt had béen in garriſon there, and had married a wife in the Towne. But the watchfull diligence of them of the Religion there dwelling was ſuch, that they diſcouered him the ſame night, and chaſed him away with his Marchants.</p>
               <p>About the latter ende of March, the King perceiuing the drifts of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="28"/> Leaguers to procéed to great outrages, and that his long ſuffering might greatly further their deſperatnes, the 28. of March writeth to his officers euery where, certifying them that the Armes were not taken by his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, forbiddeth all men to take any Armes hereafter, commandeth them who haue alreadie taken to lay them downe, chargeth his officers to lay hand on them which doo refuſe ſo to doo, and to procéede againſt them by order of lawe as againſt rebels, if they can be apprehended, and willeth the Gouernours of Townes and Prouinces to ſet vpon them as vpon Traytors.</p>
               <p>The King alſo armed the Dukes <hi>Ioyeuſe</hi> and <hi>Eſpernon,</hi> with authoritie and power to ſet vpon the Leaguers, who defeated their companies in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers places.

               <p>Marſhall <hi>Matignon</hi> gouernour of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> putteth out of the Caſtle <hi>Trompet</hi> the Lord <hi>Vailhac,</hi> Gouernour of the ſayd Caſtle, for being one of the Leaguers, and for hauing intelligences with the King of <hi>Spayne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe beginnings of the Leaguers being as yet doubtfull, not ſo well frequented, nor ſo lucky as they hoped it would haue béen, nor yet ſo well repreſſed and preuented as the King might haue done, if he had had good counſell, or might haue followed his owne. Theſe beginnings (I ſay) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but wauering, &amp; ſuch as might procure them a great fall, they thought that it was high time to beſtirre themſelues about their buſines, and to ioyne policie with ſuch ſmall power as they had, leaſt that in galloping o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer haſtily, they ſhould fall and breake their neckes. For conſidering that to wrap the Realme of luſtines into new troubles, againſt the Kings will, without rendering a probable reaſon, would procure to them &amp; their houſe more hatred, than they were able to ſuſtain, they labour to doo two things, to wit; to deriue the hatred vpon them whom they had determined to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:8966:18"/>
and then to ſeeke to draw the king in proceſſe of time to their faction, as at length they did, as it ſhall appeare hereafter.</p>
               <p>To couer therfore their ambitious rebellion vnder ſome colour of right, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1585. March"/> they hid their ſhame vnder a Cardinals hat; for they bring i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtage the Cardinall of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> as the author of this Tragedie, whereon they make him play <hi>Getas</hi> part.

And for becauſe the Cardinalls hat would not warrant this clayme and rebellion, they goe about to ſhadowe it with ſome colour of pietie and iuſtice (which indeede were trodden vnder foote by themſelues, and by the warres and tumults which they had kindled, fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered and intertayned fiue and twentie yeares together, to bring to paſſe theſe their now manifeſt intents) they ſet foorth a declaration contayning plauſible cauſes among men of all degrees, of their taking of Armes, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring date the 31. of March. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="31"/>
               </p>
               <p>Where note how the <hi>Guizes</hi> haue hid their treaſon vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Cardinals name, and the Cardinall taketh the cloake of religion and iuſtice; ſo they abuſing that olde Noble man as a <hi>Geta</hi> or ſlaue, doo make him ſpeake in ſuch ſort as followeth.</p>
               <p>But doo not thinke (gentle Reader) that I ſpeake vnreuerently of that noble Prince, iſſued out of ſuch an ancient and noble raſe, but to ſhewe the vnaduiſed facilitie of that man, who ſuffered himſelfe to be ſo abuſed, as to become a ſlaue and a <hi>Geta</hi> vnto the ambition of other men, and by the ſame meane hath ſet his Countrey, (in the which hée did beare ſo many honors) his naturall and lawfull Prince, his houſe, his kindred and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ſo honorable, ancient and famous, in a miſerable combuſtion and daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to be rooted out, for a vayne imagination to become a King. But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to the purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, they make him require the aboliſhing of the reformed religion, and that the ſtabliſhing of the Catholike religion may not bee interrupted hereafter, whatſoeuer alteration may happen in the ſucceſſion of the Crowne, they all of them (I meane the Leaguers) naming themſelues falſly (only except the Cardinall <hi>Bourbon)</hi> Princes of the blood, doo require that a Catholike ſucceſſor may be nominated, which to bee the Cardinall himſelfe, becauſe he had (as they ſuppoſed) but few yeres to liue, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was not like to ſtand long in their way.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they doo require that the K. of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and their heires may bee declared incapable to ſucceede to the Crowne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in caſe the King ſhould dye without iſſue, alleaging that they are heretickes and relaps. And note, that for the reſt of the Princes of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> to wit, the Cardinall <hi>Vendoſme,</hi> the Earles, Princes, and Countie of <hi>Soyſſons,</hi> they doo exclude them from the ſucceſſion of the Crowne, becauſe they are
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:8966:18"/>
ſonnes of an hereticke, or otherwiſe contemptuouſly paſſe them ouer, as not able to buckle with them. The houſe of <hi>Monpenſier</hi> is beyond the x. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1585. March"/> degree of aguation. The King himſelfe cannot liue long, for they will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for that: therfore the concluſion is eaſily to be inferred. The Crowne is fallen in the laps of the Péeres of <hi>France,</hi> they muſt procéede to election of a newe King. And who ſhould bee elected (I pray you) but Maſter <hi>Francis</hi> of <hi>Lorreyne?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, they do quarrell with the king for fauouring the Duke <hi>Eſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non:</hi> as though the king may not fauour, but whom the Leaguers ſhall appoint him. The cauſe they do pretend is, that <hi>Eſpernon</hi> is a fauorer of heretikes, that is to ſay: he is too faithfull to the king for their turne.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, they do alleage, that the Clergie, Nobilitie, and Commons are charged with intollerable bondage and exactions, whom they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore to their old dignity and liberty.</p>
               <p>The king had geuen the gouernment of <hi>Prouance</hi> to <hi>Monſieur</hi> the great Pryor, who had publiſhed the edict of peace according to the kinges <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Aprill"/> commaundement, and cauſed it to bee preciſely obſerued in his gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Prouance.</hi> But the Leaguers had drawen to their conſpiracie a great number of that Countrey with Spaniſh piſtolets, and ſpecially a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others, two noble men, to wit, <hi>Monſieur de Saultes</hi> and <hi>Vines.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe two applyed the market for the League in <hi>Prouance</hi> with Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Piſtolets, and woon on their ſide the Conſul of <hi>Marſeilles</hi> named <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> and a Captaine of the towne named <hi>Boniface.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The 9. day of Aprill theſe two heads of ſedition came in the euening to the doore of one <hi>Boniface,</hi> brother to this Captayne aforenamed, who was the kings receauer in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> countrey, with fained letters from <hi>Mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſieur</hi> great Prior, which was at <hi>Aix</hi> the head towne in <hi>Prouance.</hi> The ſaid <hi>Boniface</hi> the kinges receauer came to the dore, his owne wife carrying the Candel before him, who was immediatly ſlaine by the ſaid Captayne his owne brother, the Conſull <hi>Darius</hi> and their company at his owne doore, and in his wiues preſence. This exploit done, the Parricide himſelf with few of his owne company, went vp to ranſake the houſe, and rifled all that was there to their lyking.</p>
               <p>From thence with a company of ſeditious people armed, they went to the houſes of them of the reformed religion, whom they lead with great violence, and a great number of priſoners into the tower of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> &amp; afterward made great hauocke of theyr goods.</p>
               <p>The 10. day they tooke 4. of them more, &amp; manly, one named <hi>Chiouſſe,</hi> and the other <hi>Antony Lambalent:</hi> which they cruelly murthered: and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> that their bodyes had béen drawen through the ſtréetes, at length they were caſt downe ouer the walles into the towne ditch, before the face of them who were detained priſoners in Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> tower, intending to

               <p>The 11. day the ſeditious ſeaze vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fort of <hi>Nostre Dame de la garde,</hi> and wrote letters to <hi>Monſieur Vines,</hi> praying him to come in all haſt, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> with ſome fortes to take the towne to the vſe and kéeping of the League, promiſing him their aſſiſtance. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Aprill"/>
               </p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Neuers</hi> a man of his owne Countrey, to wit, an Italian did then lurke in <hi>Auignon,</hi> and had procured 4. Galleyes of the Duke of <hi>Florence</hi> to be in readines in the hauen, vnder the colour to goe to a mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age into <hi>Italy:</hi> at the firſt newes to haue haſted out of <hi>Auignon,</hi> and with his companie ioyning to <hi>Monſieur</hi> of <hi>Vines,</hi> to haue made that towne ſure for the kyng of <hi>Spaine</hi> according to their agreement, when they coſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him of his Piſtolets, or elſe to ſome pety Duke of <hi>Italy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There was a certayne man in the City of great wealth, credit &amp; power, named <hi>Boukier:</hi> for feare of this man many of the chiefeſt citizens, by reaſon of ſome particular diſpleaſures, ſtanding in great diſtruſt of him, &amp; ſuppoſing that now he would take occaſion to be reuenged of them, fledde into the Abbey of Saint <hi>Victor.</hi> But <hi>Boukier,</hi> conſidering the daunger that the towne ſtoode in, and the common perill of them all, ſent to them that had fled into the ſaid Abbey, aduertyſing them that the time did not require to call to remembrance priuat iniuries, aſſured them of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will and ſafety of his part, and required their aſſiſtance in kéeping the ſaid towne in the kinges obedience, and to looke to the common preſeruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of themſelues.</p>
               <p>Theſe fearfull Citizens being ſo reconcyled, and encouraged by this waighty occaſion, and ioyning together, went to know of the ſaid Conſul <hi>Darius,</hi> &amp; Captaine <hi>Boniface,</hi> by what authority they did that which they had done. And when they anſwered to haue done it by the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the grand Prior, and could ſhew nothing for it, they were appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended: and the ſame day letters were diſpatched to the grand Prior be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then at <hi>Aix,</hi> to aduertize him of the intended and attempted treaſon, and what had paſſed there.</p>
               <p>The 12. day the graund Prior came from <hi>Aix</hi> to <hi>Marſeilles</hi> with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> 2. hundred horſes, and a Chamber of the Parliament of <hi>Prouance,</hi> who do hold their court there.</p>
               <p>The 13. Day, the ſaid Chamber (after due examination of the fact, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> euident knowledge and proofes of the offences there committed) pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced ſentence of death againſt the ſaid 2. heads of the treaſon, to <hi>Darius</hi> &amp; <hi>Boniface,</hi> which out of hand were executed. Alſo they ſet at libertie them of there formed religion, with commaundement on both ſides to kepe the kinges edict, and ſo by theſe meanes the towne was deliuered from dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of changing of maſtery, the people from death, and vndoing, and the tumult ceaſed. This ſpéedy execution did greatly weaken and preuent the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:8966:19"/>
monopols of the League in the countrie of <hi>Prouance.</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1585"/>
               </p>
               <p>About the 15. day the Leaguers haſting to ſeaze vpon as many townes and houldes as they could in all <hi>France,</hi> to make their part ſtrong, as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n=""/> well by force as faction, but ſpeciaily in <hi>Belgik,</hi> where they could do more then in any part of <hi>France,</hi> there they committed great cruelties in many places, where hauing the vpper hand, they were withſtoode: namely in the towne of <hi>Chaſtilion</hi> vppon the riuer <hi>Marne</hi> in the countrey of <hi>Brie,</hi> they murthered as well the Catholikes as the <hi>Hugonets,</hi> becauſe they made re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance againſt them.</p>
               <p>About the 20. day the Leaguers did preſent their aſſociation, which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> they had ſet forth in writing to many Noblemen and Gentlemen, vnder the name of the King, requiring them to allow of it, and ſubſcribe to it. But contrary to their expectation, many refuſed ſo to do: and diuers who had allowed it, conſidering more déeply in the matter, &amp; perceiuing their intentes, abiured and forſooke it, with proteſtations ſet forth in writing, &amp; printed, wherein they do open the ſecret thoughtes of the Leaguers, and Leagued.</p>
               <p>Firſt, they do proteſt that they do acknowledge none other faith then that, in the which they haue béen baptized, which then they did promiſe to beléeue and defend, and to that promiſe they do ſtand ſtill.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they do refuſe and condemne all manner of aſſociations, vnder what ſoeuer color, which binde them to obay any other then their Soueraygne.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, they do ſhew the League to bee nothing elſe, but the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention of the king, the confuſion of the State, a dangerous alteration of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Realme, the bringing of a new Prince of a ſtrange blood: and finally cary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with it ſelfe a proſcription, hauocke, and bondage of all good men in all degrées.</p>
               <p>About the 22. of Aprill, the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> in ſilence beholding the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22"/> rage of this League, and their declaration publiſhed, in the which they had made him the obiect of their inſurrection, ſent the Lordes <hi>Clairuant,</hi> and <hi>Chaſſincourt</hi> with letters to the King, in the which he complaineth of the iniuries of the Leaguers proffered vnto him in their declaration, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring iuſtice to be done for the ſayd iniuries done vnto him. He offereth alſo his ſeruice &amp; power to the King, for to repreſſe the traiterous intentes and attempts of the ſaid Leaguers.</p>
               <p>About the 30. of Aprill the King willeth the ſaid Lordes <hi>Clairuant</hi> &amp; <hi>Chaſsincourt</hi> to giue this gentle anſwere to the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> him. That he doth hold the ſayd King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> as his ſonne, and heire of his crowne: willeth him alſo to arme himſelfe with patience, &amp; to cauſe the edict of peace to be obſerued by them of the reformed Religion. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, that hee acknowledgeth the driftes of the Leaguers, aſwell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:8966:20"/>
his own perſon, as againſt the ſaid King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> but hopeth that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1585"/> he ſhal be able himſelfe alone to repreſſe their furies, and to puniſh them wel for their deſertes.</p>
               <p>The ſecond day of May the King by edict and proclamation doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnethe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Maye"/> Leaguers and Leagued, guilty of high treaſon, commaundeth his edict of pacification to be proclaimed a new in all partes of the realme, charging all men vpon paine of death to obay and kéepe it inuiolably.</p>
               <p>At the ſame time alſo the King anſwered to euery point of their decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the ſaid Leaguers, whereof the ſumme followeth.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the King proteſteth of his Catholike Religion, and calleth to witnes his actions, victories, daungers, and labours taken for the ſame.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he ſheweth that the peace was made, and approoued by the counſell of the Cardinall (in whoſe name they do ſéeme to autorize their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> rebellion) and of the reſt of the Leaguers, not to fauour heretikes (as hee tearmes them) but to reſtore the decayed ſtate of the realme, to aſſault them of the reformed religion in conuenient time with greater forces.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, he declareth how he hath fauored the Cleargie, in giuing them liberty to call prouinciall counſels, and to ref<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rme ſuch abuſes, as the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill warres had brought in, how he hath alſo preferred the woorthieſt ſort to the beſt Eccleſiaſticall liuinges, and hath reſtored to their liuinges them who were diſpoſſeſſed thereofby the former ciuill warres.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, that the Leaguers haue no cauſe to complaine for the geuing of offices. For his predeceſſors and he after them, haue beſtowed vpon the <hi>Guyzes</hi> the beſt ſort, and moſt honorable dignities, and that in great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, when the Princes of his blood haue béen neglected.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, that it is to force nature, and tyme to compell him by violence of armes to appoint a ſucceſſor, hée being aliue in ſtrength, health, and flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of his age, and not out of hope to haue iſſue.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all, he complayneth that this new commotion is very vnfit and out of ſeaſon, conſidering that he was now earneſtly bent and occupyed to reſtore the Nobilitie to their ancient honor and dignity, and the people to their due liberty. But by this leauie of armes they haue ſtopped his god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly procéedinges, and haue taken the way to oppreſſe and root out the Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, nobility and people.</p>
               <p>About the ſame time alſo the King ſent Ambaſſadors into forreine coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryes, and commaunded his ordinary Ambaſſadors in the courtes of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reine Princes, to geue them knowledge of the wicked intentes, and tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous attemptes of the Leaguers.</p>
               <p>The Leaguers in a ſhort ſpace had ſcattered abroad the Piſtolets of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and about the beginning of Iune they began alſo to take money; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="June 3"/> and therefore thought good to ſupply the want of Piſtolets with French crownes, which is ſomewhat purer gold: for they exacted in diuers places
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:8966:20"/>
great and exceſſiue ſummes of money vpon the townes and cities, which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1585"/> they had either ſeduced to their fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

As by one we may gather the reſt. <hi>Bourge</hi> being a ſmall towne in <hi>Xainctonge</hi> ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vpon the fall of the riuer <hi>Dordonne,</hi> into <hi>Garomne,</hi> a towne leagued and extreamly addicted to the Leaguers, was by them raunſomed to ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand crownes, and afterward the inhabitantes ſo cruelly intreated, that in leaping by night ouer the walles, were enforced to ſteale away for feare of worſe, ſuppoſing them ſelues to haue ſped well in eſcaping with their liues.</p>
               <p>About the ſame time the Lord Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> gouernor of <hi>Browage,</hi> ſent a certayne Captayn into the Iles of <hi>Maran,</hi> vnder colour to buy Oates for his prouiſion, to ſee whether hee could worke ſome ſurprizing of the Caſtell. But the Captayne was ſo roughly ſhouldered and courſed, that he was glad to retire with his whole ſkinne. And after that (leaſt the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes ſhould put ſome into the Caſtell) euery night 6. or 7. of the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med religion with Caliuers, conuayed themſelues priuily in the darke of the night into the gate of the Caſtell vntill day. The Papiſtes vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this, and alſo hearing the threatnings ofthem of the Religion, to wit, that if they ſhould bee driuen away, they would burne the Papiſtes houſes afore their departing, more for feare then for loue, were content to admit 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of them of the Religion into the Caſt. I, whom they did chooſe from among them that were altogether vnſkilfull in warre.

               <p>Now let the Reader conſider, what neceſſary concluſion may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred out of the reaſons aboue rehearſed.</p>
               <p>The 9. day of Iune from <hi>Chalons</hi> a towne in <hi>Champagne</hi> ſituated vpon the riuer <hi>Marne,</hi> the Leaguers ſent a ſupplication to the King, in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> which they ſhew their laſt reſolution, to be that they will make him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend to theſe articles folowing, whether he will or not.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that according to the ſupplication preſented by the ſtates, aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at <hi>Bloys</hi> the yeare before, to wit, 1584. repreſenting the whole realme: he will forbid the exerciſe of the reformed religion, throughout the whole realme.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that all men be compelled to profeſſe the popiſh religion, and that ſuch as haue heretofore profeſſed the reformed religion, may bee enforced to abiure the ſame: and in caſe they will not, to be exiled out of the realme for euer.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that all heretikes (for ſo they tearme them which will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to their treaſons, or idolatrous ſuperſtition) bee declared vncapable of any office, dignity or publike charge.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, they require the townes geuen to them of the reformed reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, to be taken out of their handes.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, that the King ſhall geue ouer the protection of <hi>Geneua,</hi> againſt the Duke of <hi>Sauoye.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſt of all, that the King ſhall ſweare before his court of Parliament of <hi>Paris:</hi> the contents of this their requeſt reduced into the forme of an edict, to be perpetually, and inuiolably obſerued: and likewiſe ſhall cauſe all the Princes, Peeres, officers of the Crowne, Senators, Gouernors &amp; Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, to ſweare to obſerue and defend the ſayd edict.</p>
               <p>To be ſhort, they aduertized the King that they haue refuſed all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:8966:21"/>
of conference, except it bee vpon theſe conditions, and in caſe he will not do this, they will make him do it whether he will or not.</p>
               <p>But for the right vnderſtanding of this ſupplication, the Reader muſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1585. Iune"/> marke, that it is not Religion which they care for: for their driftes are onely to ſpoile the King of all authoritie and power, that they may at length robbe him of his royall eſtate: therefore theſe thinges following are to be obſerued.</p>
               <p>There were there in <hi>France</hi> thrée ſorts of men, who (as the Leaguers thought) would marre all the playe, to wit, the Princes, Nobilitie, and People. Of the firſt, they feared greatly the forces, the valour, authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and fidelitie, knowing very well that they were able both in power and credite, to miniſter them play long enough to weary them, and by their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour able to encounter with them euery where, and that through their fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, they would neuer forſake the King in his néede, although that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they were deuided in religion: conſidering alſo that they haue the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt intereſt to the Crowne.</p>
               <p>As for the Nobilitie, they conſidered that they were of thrée ſorts, Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guers, Catholikes, and Proteſtants. The Nobles and the Commons which doo profeſſe the reformed religion, they knewe by long experience to bee ſo ſkilfull and experienced in warre, as thereby to bee inuincible, and that by all their fayre promiſes proffered vnto them, they could not bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooued from their alleagance to their ſoueraigne King and Prince, whom God had ordayned ouer them. By this their ſupplication therefore, coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the hypocriticall cloake of Catholikiſme, they would fayne to bée rid of the Princes and Nobilitie reformed, or els to deuide them a ſunder, that the more eaſily they might make them giue roume, or els roote them out.</p>
               <p>As for the common people reformed, they ſuppoſe that they being ſcattered into diuers popiſh Prouinces, could bee ſo vſed, as that they might not flocke together, but euery man in an imminent danger would bee carefull how to ſaue himſelfe in ſome place of ſafe exile. That is the cauſe that they crye out in their ſupplication, baniſhment and exile.</p>
               <p>As for the Catholikes both Noble and Common, they are in hope that ſuperſtition it ſelfe would win them on their ſide. But if the riddance of them of the reformed religion out of the Realme might not bee throughly done, yet the King and the Catholikes being bound with an oth to execute their demaunds, would at the pleaſure of the Leaguers nouriſh an immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall warre: by the which the King ſhould conſume his ſubiects, and the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects their King with mutuall blowes, vntill the roume being either made voyde or weakened, &amp; they hauing that thorne (which ſo ſore prickt them) out of theyr foote, might vprightly (without any halting) eyther ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in place, or els eaſily ſhoulder him out who had right to it.</p>

                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:8966:22"/>
The 10. of the ſayd moneth, the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> being at <hi>Bergerack,</hi> a great Towne in <hi>Perigord,</hi> ſituated vpon the riuer of <hi>Dordonne,</hi> anſwereth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1585. Iune. 10"/> vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt declaration of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Leaguers which he ſent to the King, beſeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to reade the ſaid anſwer, and alſo to ſhew him y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fauour, as to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund the ſame to bee read openly in the Parliament. Wherein firſt hée proteſteth, that hee holdeth the true Chriſtian Catholike and Apoſtolike religion contayned in the ſacred word of God, both of the olde and newe Teſtaments, and alſo doth embrace the ſymbols or abridgements of the Chriſtian doctrine: And that he is ready to beſtowe life and goods in the defence of the ſame. Abhorreth &amp; holdeth accurſed any kind of doctrine, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers or contrary to the ſame words.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he ſheweth that he was bred, borne, and brought vp in the ſame religion, which they call hereſie, and that he neuer learned, nor knew any other, and that he beléeueth in his heart to righteouſneſſe, and confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth with his mouth to ſaluation, that the ſame doctrine which he doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe is the infallible trueth of God; yet he refuſeth not to be taught better, if better they can teach him out of Gods word in a generall or nationall Councell duely aſſembled.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, in that which he doth in repurging and ſweeping away the errors and abuſes brought in by long continuance of time, therein he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth the examples of many Kings and Princes, of many godly &amp; lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men, who for theſe fiue hundred yeares haue deſired and attempted the ſame.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, whereas his enemies doo charge him to be a perſecutor of the Catholike religion, he will bee iudged by all men voyde of paſſion, who hath greater cauſe to complayne in that behalfe, he or his enemies.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all, after a long conſideration of the miſeries which fall vpon the heads of men of all degrees, and the oppreſſion of the poore people, which infallibly will followe theſe attempts of the Leaguers, he doth wiſh (ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the enemies haue made him partie) the quarrell which they haue to him might bee ended with a Combat. And debaſing himſelfe from that high degree of a King, in the which God hath placed him, for an abridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all miſeries, the ſparing of Chriſtian bloud, for the eaſe and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the poore people, doth proffer to his enemies to trie the matter by a Combat, betwéene him and the Duke of <hi>Guize,</hi> or two to two, ten to ten, or more to more in like proportion.</p>
               <p>It is reported how the Duke of <hi>Guize</hi> after the fight of this challenge, being vrged to accept it, excuſed his cowardize by the example of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which in like caſe excuſed himſelfe vpon the inequalitie of the perſons. To wit, that it was not lawfull for him to accept that challenge at the hands of one of the Princes, as being after the royall houſe in degree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all the reſt of the Nobilitie.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:8966:22"/>
But rather and more truely may it bee ſayde, that he (who being not a Prince, did reckon and write his name among the Princes, or rather pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred himſelfe before the Princes of the royall bloud) did refuſe this prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1585. June"/> not of any dutifull affection as he pretended, (whereof hee had broken before the bonds of lawe) but rather vpon baſe cowardize, for lacke of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and courage, as euer caring not what he ſpent of other mens bloud, ſo that he might ſpare his owne.</p>
               <p>Theſe things paſſing to and fro, many exploytes of hoſtilitie were done and executed on euery ſide, rather to the loſſe than the aduauntage of the Leaguers, being croſſed euery way by the true ſubiects of the King. Wherevpon, conſidering that the worlde frowned vpon them, ſo that if they had not the King on their ſide to ſalue the ſore, they were like to haue a great fall: therefore they muſt followe ſome other courſe.</p>
               <p>Hetherto the <hi>Guizes</hi> haue couered themſelues vnder the Cardinals hat, hauing deriued all the hatred (ſo farre as they might) vpon that old man, whom they greatly abuſed. Now, when the Cardinals hat would not ſerue the turne, they doo put in practiſe the other part of their dilemma, as the Cardinall or the King muſt couer vs, or els we fall: but the Cardinall cannot, <hi>ergo</hi> the King muſt. And that the King may doo it, we muſt ſet <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitophel</hi> to work: therfore let him come vpon the ſtageto play his part.</p>
               <p>The Kings Counſellers were eyther ſeruants to the <hi>Guizes,</hi> or els alied or otherwiſe deuoted vnto him, except the Dukes <hi>Espernon</hi> and <hi>Ioyeuſe,</hi> whereof the laſt afterward was woon to the Leaguers ſide; <hi>Espernon</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned alwayes more faithfull to the King, than the King to himſelfe. For the which cauſe (by the meanes of a Curtizan in <hi>Paris,</hi> named <hi>Sainte Beufue)</hi> they hyred <hi>Villeroy</hi> (one of the Kings Secretaries) to haue mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered him, ſo to haue béen eaſed of that heauy burthen. Theſe Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers muſt play <hi>Achitophels</hi> part, they muſt helpe vp with the packe by the meanes which followe.</p>
               <p>They in the middeſt of theſe broyles, did of purpoſe attenuate the grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and forces of the League, as a thing weake of it ſelfe rather to bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed than regarded, as not able to continue long, but that it would decay of it ſelfe, and that ſome certayne inconſiderate zeale of the Catholike Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion had made them ſomewhat paſſionate: and for to make him more ſecure on y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſide, they deriued his thoughts from the Leaguers with a but.</p>
               <p>But if he would once ſhewe a token of diſpleaſure towards them of the reformed religion, or would onely fayne to intend warre againſt them, the Leaguers of themſelues would fall downe vpon their knees before him, therefore it were better to let them alone, for as much as they would bee ready to be with him whenſoeuer he would employ them.</p>
               <p>Alſo that it were better for him to warre againſt them of the reformed religion in <hi>Poytow, Guien, Gaſcoyne, Languedocke,</hi> and <hi>Daulphine,</hi> than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

them of his owne religion. For although the Proteſtants were dutifull and obedient enough, yet were it better to haue them for enemies, being the weaker ſide, than the Leaguers and Catholikes which were the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1585.

               </p>
               <p>Therfore the 18. day of Iune, partly for hatred which he bare to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="18"/> religion, partly already inclining to the League, partly not knowing what he did, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great dangers that he ſaw himſelf compaſſed in, by the perſwaſions of ſuch Counſellers as had blindfolded him, according to the ſaying, <hi>Si non ſua ſponte inſanit: instiga.</hi> For being in the Citie of <hi>Paris,</hi> he taketh order how to victuall his Armie in <hi>Poytow,</hi> for the which thing he appoynted certayne Townes in <hi>Poytow</hi> &amp; <hi>Xainctonge,</hi> to wit, <hi>Chatelerault,</hi> S. <hi>Merxent, Niort, Fonteney, Towars, Engoleſme, Xainctes,</hi> and <hi>Coignack,</hi> there to haue alwaies in ſtore a certayne quantitie of Corne, Dates and Wine, as in ſtore houſes, which order he ſendeth to the ſayd Townes to be put in execution.</p>
               <p>The King being thus deluded by his Counſell, and buſying himſelfe about theſe matters of warre agaynſt them of the reformed religion (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were in earneſt or by diſſimulation, God knoweth, but at length it turned to earneſt) he giueth leaue and time to the Leaguers to grow grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in ſtrength and number, and forgoeth the occaſions and opportunitie to prouide for neceſſary remedies agaynſt them.</p>
               <p>Theſe Counſellers at length when they ſaw time, came once more vpon the ſtage. And on a ſudden they terrified the King agayne (as of a thing happened beſide their expectation) with the great ſtrength of the League, ſhewing what great danger might inſue, if he ſhould ſeeme to ſaile againſt that violent tempeſt. Conſidering that the reſolution of reſtoring the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike religion, and of the ſuppreſſing the reformed, had poſſeſſed gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally the mindes of the people. So that if he ſhould ſeeme to withſtand the zeale of the Leaguers (for their treaſon was with them zeale of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh religion) he would be commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly thought to be a fauourer of heretikes, and thereby an vniuerſall rebellion of his ſubiects might enſue, to the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vndoing of him and his eſtate. Therefore, that as a good Pilot he muſt obey the weather, and ſeeke for ſome reconciliation, and make peace with them as much to his aduantage, as the neceſſitie of the affayres may ſuffer him. And that in ſuch an extreame caſe hée muſt holde with the ſtrongeſt ſide.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:8966:23"/>
Theſe and many other conſiderations propounded vnto him, which had loſt his authoritie (and that by them which wholly ruled him) through a iuſt iudgement of God (for deſpiſing the voyce of him, and for perſecuting <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1585.

               <p>Thus the King (through Gods iuſt iudgement, and the pernicious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions of his vnfaithfull Counſell) bewitched, doth determine to make peace with enemies as good cheape as he may: and for that thing he muſt ſeeke out ſome good chapman ſkilfull and practiſed in olde Italian trickes. Therefore he thought that his Mother was moſt fit, as moſt ſkilfull in ſuch markets.</p>
               <p>This accurſed woman, as ſhe had alwaies an ambitious and buſie ſoule, ſo ſhe had alſo a double mind, by the which ſhe ſtudied to haue great thanks for doing no good, and to kéepe her ſelfe in authoritie, and in the poſſeſſion of the gouernment, thought it ſhould coſt her the ſubuerſion of her owne houſe and children, and the vtter deſolation of the Realme.

               <p>The King as a naturall ſonne put her alwaies in great truſt, iudging of her naturalnes and loue towards him, as he did iudge of his towards her.

               <p>The night following, the comming of S. <hi>Hermin</hi> nigh <hi>Marans,</hi> there was a great alarum in the Towne, and the Papiſts which were in the Caſtle to the number of fiue and twentie, ſuppoſing that S. <hi>Hermin</hi> and his companie had entered the Towne, began to reioyce, ſing and daunce at the ſound of a bag-pipe, which they cauſed to play the moſt part of that night, threatning them of the religion who were but foure in number. But theſe foure ſtanding on their warde, charged them not to make any innouation with them of the League; ſo that not onely they kept the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts in feare, but alſo at length (with a certayne amazement of them) cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their pag-pipe to ceaſe.</p>
               <p>About the ſame time, the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> vnderſtanding how things were like to paſſe betwéene the King and the Leaguers, departed from <hi>Rochel</hi> to repayre to the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> and leaueth the Lord <hi>Rohan</hi> in <hi>Poytow,</hi> to ouerlooke and withſtand the attempts of the Leaguers there.</p>
               <p>The ſayd Lord. <hi>Rohan</hi> about y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 12. of Iuly, departed from <hi>Rochel</hi> with foure ſcore horſes, and rode to <hi>Marauns,</hi> to aſſure thoſe Ilandes. The <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Papiſtes had already ſeazed the fort called <hi>Brune</hi> where through the ſayd Lord ſhould paſſe: but their hartes ſo fayled them, that they durſt not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt him. Entring therfore without any reſiſtance into the towne of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans,</hi> hee called the inhabitantes of both religions, and told them, that hee had determined to place a gentleman within the Caſtell to kéepe the ſame in obedience to the King, vnder the gouernement of the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:8966:24"/>
gouernour of <hi>Guyen</hi> for the ſayd King, which thing if they would refuſe, hee would burne all their houſes into aſhes. And therefore bid them out of hand to chuſe a gentleman of his company, ſuch as they would them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1585. Iuly"/> there to commaund, to the which thing, ſome with a good will, and ſome vnwillingly, but yet all obayed.</p>
               <p>There was a certaine Notary, who had profeſſed the reformed religion after a ſort: hee the day before the Lord <hi>Rohan</hi> his comming, hauing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence thereof, went to the Papiſtes from houſe to houſe, warning them to ſtand to their defence agaynſt the ſayd Lord <hi>Rohan,</hi> and to enter into the Caſtle firſt, to let the ſaid Lord <hi>Rohan</hi> from the entring. By whoſe perſwaſions, a great number of Papiſtes, and of the moſt ſkilfull in warre with their Notary ſeazed on the Caſtell. But foure Gentlemen of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed religion, hauing gotten the tower of the gate, which commaunded ouer the court of the ſayd caſtell, did threaten to ſhoote againſt all ſuch, as would preſume to let the ſaid Lord <hi>Rohan</hi> enter in, or any other whom hee would place there.</p>
               <p>So the Papiſtes with their Notary began to ſpeake fayre, and to open the gate to the Lord <hi>Sowſaye</hi> of <hi>Beauregard,</hi> whom the inhabitantes had required there to commaund: he entred therein with the Lord <hi>Mortaygne</hi> his brother the 15. day of Iuly: and hauing receaued the oath of the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants to be faythfull vnto the King, vnder the authority of the King, of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> 
                  <hi>Nauarre,</hi> gouernor for the King in <hi>Guyene</hi> departed, and left his brother the Lord <hi>Mortaygne</hi> there as his lieftenant.</p>
               <p>Whileſt theſe ſmall quarrelinges did ſo paſſe at <hi>Marans,</hi> we haue left the <hi>Q. Mother</hi> with her Counſellers, to make the bargayne, and to ſell to the Leaguers the crowne of <hi>France,</hi> the Kings authority and honor, for as litle as they may afoord it, that is, <hi>gratis,</hi> and for iuſt nothing.</p>
               <p>The affayres were handled with ſuch faithfulnes, that theſe Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers as ſoone as they came out of their chamber, went into another to ſit in counſell by them ſelues, to aduertiſe the Leaguers day by day of all which they had gone about, and with the <hi>Q. Mother:</hi> alſo, what was the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition from time to time, to aduiſe the Leaguers what they ſhould requeſt, and how farre they ſhould yeeld: at length, after long changing and chop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of wordes, <hi>ſaeuis inter ſe conuenit vrſis.</hi> Certaine Articles are conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> at <hi>Chalons</hi> in <hi>Champaygne</hi> the twelfth day of Iuly, which do conſiſt of thrée principall pointes.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that the King ſhall make an edict, in the which hee ſhall graunt them all that they requeſted at <hi>Bloys</hi> the laſt yeare to wit 1584. in the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of the ſtates there.</p>
               <p>Alſo, all whatſoeuer they demaunded by their declaration, bearing date the laſt day of March: and all what was required of them in their laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, dated the tenth day of Iune at <hi>Chalons:</hi> and that is as much as
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:8966:25"/>
they would for this tyme.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that leuying of armes, all actions of hoſtility committed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1585. Iulie"/> ſince by them, or by their partakers, or by the townes and cities of their aſſociation ſhall bee allowed, and declared good, lawfull, and done for the Kinges ſeruice, for the defence of holy Church, and aduauncing of Gods glory.</p>
               <p>Hereby the actions of hoſtility are comprehended, the murthers, ſpoils, robberies, ranſackinges, riflinges of publike or priuat thinges, all rapes, whoredoms, &amp; villanyes committed by them of the League, which all the King muſt thinke, and publiſh by his authority, to bee done for his ſeruice, and the defence of the Popiſh Church. Here is a King but bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſerued.</p>
               <p>Alſo that all iudiciall proceedinges, iudgementes, proſcriptions, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnations, and executions paſſed agaynſt them of the League, ſhall bee reuoked and declared voyde, wrongfull and vniuſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, before his owne face, they enforced him to deuide his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome among them: and of a King of <hi>France</hi> (for to pleaſe the League) he hath made himſelfe one of the thrée kinges of <hi>Colen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now followeth the good bargayne, which they when the King had ſent to make his market, had agreed on: whether it be to the kings aduantage and honor, let euery man iudge. Here is an other point of the Leaguers good ſeruice to theyr King.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the Cardinall of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> the new king of the Friers muſt bee prouided for, and let him be ſure that he ſhall haue the leaſt part. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the places belonging to his Biſhopricke of <hi>Roan,</hi> he ſhall haue the old caſtell of <hi>Deepe,</hi> which no body elſe will haue.</p>
               <p>The Duke moreouer ſhall haue the gouernement of <hi>Britaine,</hi> and two of the ſtrongeſt places that he ſhall name in that Prouince, with the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty of the ſame.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Guyze</hi> ſhall haue the citadel of <hi>Mets,</hi> becauſe his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of <hi>Champaigne</hi> hath no places good inough for him.</p>
               <p>The Duke <hi>de Mayn</hi> in his gouernment of <hi>Burgondie</hi> ſhall haue the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtell of <hi>Dyjon,</hi> or the citadell of <hi>Chalons</hi> vpon <hi>Sawne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Cardinall of <hi>Guyze</hi> ſhall haue <hi>Rhemes,</hi> and the countrie about ſo much as he will.</p>
               <p>The Duke <hi>Aumall</hi> ſhall haue the holdes of his gouernment of <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cardie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wee ſee how the great maſters be indifferently well prouided for: now theyr ſeruantes and partakes muſt haue part of the kinges ſpoyle, or elſe they will frowne and tell tales.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the Lord <hi>Antragues</hi> ſhall haue <hi>Orleance.</hi>

The Lord <hi>Briſſacke</hi> ſhall haue the gouernement of <hi>Anjou.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Mandelot (Q. Mothers</hi> Scullion) ſhall haue <hi>Lyons,</hi> and the Citadel there.</p>
               <p>I pray you maſters hold your handes, you be well if you could conſider it: vſe him no worſe then his granfather <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt prophecied of you: lethim haue his doublet and his bréech to couer his ſhame.</p>
               <p>But how chaunce that in your partition you haue forgotten your ſelues? Is <hi>Poytow, Xainctonge, Engomoys, Limoſin, Perigord. Quercye, Rowarges, Viuarets, Auvergne, Gaſcoyn, Languedocke,</hi> &amp; <hi>Daulphine</hi> nothing woorth with you? Be not theſe countries worth the hauing. If you be ſuch great Captaines as you would ſeeme to bee, there you may haue occaſion to make proofe of your valiantnes, if your ſtomacke ſerueth you: but you will ſay, it would coſt blowes, and that you loue not.</p>
               <p>Here gentle Reader, conſider the courſe which theſe luſtie buddes of <hi>Charlemayne</hi> do follow, they will roote the heretikes (as they ſay) out of <hi>France,</hi> they will exile them, and ridde the realme of <hi>France</hi> of them: yet they ſeaze vpon the kinges Cities and Dominions, and do enforce him to deuide his kingdome among them: but ſpecially they aſſure themſelues of thoſe prouinces, townes, cities and holdes, as had not in a maner one of the reformed religion left among them: but they either had béen mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, or elſe ſo vexed and diſquieted by the continuall dangers, which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery day compaſſed them, that they had retyred moſt into thoſe prouinces in <hi>France,</hi> which were ſafer from the violence of the Leaguers, or into forreine Countries. So they warre agaynſt the heretikes by ſubduing the Catholikes to their deuotion. They warre againſt the heretikes, where none were to make them reſiſtance: and dare not looke on the prouinces where the heretikes (as they tearme them) were in great number. But to the matter. Although the vniuſt and inconſtant dealinges of the houſe of <hi>Valoys,</hi> had empayred greatly their honor and renowne: and that this king by his own actions, at the maſſacre of Saint <hi>Bartholemy</hi> had great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtayned his garments with a ſpot that would neuer be waſhed: yet did hee alwayes retayne the authority and reputation of a Soueraygne Prince: vntill that for hatred of the Goſpell hee ſuffered the ambition of the houſe of <hi>Guyze</hi> to encroch too much vpon his royall authority and prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue, vnder colour of Catholike zeale. Thus hee weakened his royall authority, by following the counſell of Italians, thruſted into his ſeruice by the cunning of the <hi>Guyzes</hi> for that intent. Theſe Italian ſcholema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters did endeuour alwaies to rule him by the preceptes of <hi>Machiauell</hi> the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:8966:26"/>
Italian prophet: ſo that after he came to the Crowne, the <hi>Guyzes</hi> with their adherents interrupted diuers times the peace made with them of the religion, made continuall monopols and ſecret practiſes and aſſociations <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1585. Iuly"/> with his ſubiects, to the great empayring of his royall authoritie (as is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſayd) and ſtill vnder colour of Popiſh deuotion, ſo that at length ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing by the means aboueſayd ſeduced the harts of the Prieſtes &amp; Monks, of many of the Nobillity and people, hauing ſpecially woon his Senators and Counſellers, and robbed him of the good will and loue of his ſubiects, in the end by this market they haue made themſelues equall to him, they haue ſet their ſeat as high as his: ſo that now the king is nothing which they are not, except onely that as yet they do not take vpon them the name of king, but ſuffer him for a while to enioy the ſame.</p>
               <p>So that the king now hauing not onely loſt part of his Princelike ſtrength, which conſiſted in his townes cities and holds, but alſo part of his authority, which lyeth in commaunding alone as a ſoueraygne, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a fellow of the League. If you demaund why? the queſtion is ſoone anſwered, becauſe he ſet himſelfe agaynſt him, of whom he had receaued all power and authority, Hee which had giuen him, tooke it agayne for his vnthankfulneſſe.</p>
               <p>But now let vs returne to the League. Theſe articles called, the holy League being concluded to the kinges great diſaduantage and diſhonor, the edict muſt be made thereafter, which was publiſhed the 18. day of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and is commonly called the edict of vnion: wherein the king doth all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="18"/> that it pleaſeth the Leaguers, to commaund him to do, as a good obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent fellow of that holy aſſociation.</p>
               <p>Fyrſt, hee forbiddeth the exerciſe of the reformed religion throughout all his Dominions, commaunding the miniſters of the Goſpell to depart the realme out of hand.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he commandeth all men to profeſſe the popiſh religion, and that the profeſſors of the Goſpell without any reſpect of perſons, either ſhall beleeue poperie, or elſe within ſixe moneths ſhall depart out of the Realme: with licence in the meane time to ſell their goods to their owne vſes.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that as many as haue been infected with hereſie (for ſo hee cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the Goſpell of trueth) or are knowne to fauour it, ſhall bee incapable to be are any office within the Realme.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, he dooth diſſolue the bipartit and tripartit chambers of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which were ordayned for the indifferent miniſtration of iuſtice, in reſpect of religion.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, that the townes graunted to the keeping of the King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarre,</hi> at Saint <hi>Germane</hi> the yeare 1584. ſhall bee ſurrendred into the Kings hands.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:8966:26"/>
Sixtly, that all whatſoeuer offenſiue actions haue been committed by the Leaguers, their adherents, Townes, Cities, or comunalties of their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1585. Iulie"/> aſſociation, ſhall be hereafter iudged, as lawfull, good and acceptable ſeruice to the King: done for the defence of the holy Catholik Romain Religion. And that all declarations, proclamations, iudgements, preſcriptions, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnations and executions, whatſoeuer againſt the Leaguers, or any of them for the ſaid offences pronounced, ſhall be voyd, as vniuſtly &amp; wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully pronounced againſt them.</p>
               <p>Where note gentle reader, that the King is come to that bondage, that hee is perſwaded to alowe and approue all the murthers, exactions, ſpoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, excorſions, treaſons, rapes whoredomes blaſphemies, and ſacriled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, as done for his ſeruice, the defence of the Church, and aduauncing of Gods honour. Will not the Lord reuenge this puſilanimitie, in ſuch a great Magiſtrate; with ſome notable example of his iuſtice, according vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his threatnings: woe be to you which call euill good.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all, he commaundeth all manner of officers, and the Nobilitie, to ſweare the obſeruation of the ſaid edict, which he cauſed to be publiſhed and ſworne in the Parliament of <hi>Paris:</hi> hee himſelfe ſitting in iudgement the 18. day of Iuly.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> vnderſtanding the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion and publication of the edict of Iuly, appointed a certaine meeting with the Duke of <hi>Monmorency,</hi> at Saint <hi>Paule de cadioulx</hi> in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince of <hi>Albigerys,</hi> to take aduiſe together what were to bee done in thoſe extremities.</p>
               <p>They therefore the tenth of Auguſt, concluded a certaine proteſtation: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Aug. 10"/> in the which ſhewing what the intents, driftes and demeanours of the Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guers haue been: alſo what the Kings iudgement was of them, not long ſince, what meanes the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> hath ſought, and what hee hath proffered for the preſeruation of the ſtate.</p>
               <p>What his behauiour had been euer ſince the League did riſe, how hee hath kept himſelfe quiet, and vnarmed, to the extreame danger of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon when he had great occaſions to doo great exploites.</p>
               <p>At laſt, they proteſt that they are not the cauſe of al thoſe miſeries, which are like to enſue out of thoſe troubles, and ſeeing that no reaſon will take place, committing their innocencie and equitie of their cauſe vnto God, doo reſolue vpon the defenſiue.</p>
               <p>This reſolution being made, the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> returned to <hi>Nerak,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> to <hi>Rochel,</hi> and <hi>Monmorency</hi> to <hi>Languedock,</hi> to view the attempts, and expect the euents of this new and ſtrange vnion.</p>
               <p>This vnion being concluded, the King conſidering that in ſome manner hee had been enforced to breake the edict of peace, and that it was not the proclayming onely, which would cauſe the edict of vnion to be obeyed, but
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:8966:27"/>
that a certaine cauell warre would enſue, and that there muſt be ſome ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes to holde it. Therefore hee turneth all his thoughts to make ſome preparation for the warre: for the which cauſe the 11. of Auguſt he calleth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1585. Aug. 11"/> to the bowre, which is the Kings houſe, the firſt and ſecond preſidents of his Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> the Prouoſt of <hi>Paris,</hi> the Deane of our Ladies Church, and prayed the Cardinall of <hi>Guize</hi> to be preſent. Who all being come in his preſence, hee made vnto them a ſhort declaration of his will: wherein he ſheweth himſelfe glad, that at the inſtant requeſt of his good and faithfull ſubiects, he hath reuoked the edict of purification, and yet cannot beleeue, that at this time it will bee eaſier to execute this laſt reſolution, then the former. Yet being incoraged and aſſiſted with ſo many and ſo good men of all degrees, he conceaueth ſome good hope which makes him enter into theſe actions. And firſt, to come to that which is expected of all men, he dooth intend to haue three mightie armies, the one for <hi>Guyen,</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by himſelfe, the third vpon the borders of <hi>Germanie,</hi> to let the paſſage of ſtrangers, which will amount to foure hundred thouſands crownes a moneth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that hee dooth not meane to vndoo himſelfe alone, but ſeeing that he hath admitted other mens counſell againſt his owne, in breaking the edict of peace, they muſt help him in maintaining of the warre.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, for that the firſt preſident of Parliament was one of the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, who procured the peace to be broaken, neither he nor his felowes may looke to be paied of their ſtipends during the warre.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, for that the people of <hi>Paris</hi> had ſhewed ſo great reioyſing at the breaking of the peace, he commaundeth the Prouoſt of the Marchants to leuie vpon the inhabitants of the ſaide Citie, the ſumme of two hundred thouſand crownes, for the charges of the warre.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, the King beholding the Cardinall of <hi>Guize,</hi> ſomewhat with a ſtearne countenance, he let him vnderſtand, that foraſmuch as the heads of the Cleargie had chiefely caſt him into this warre, for his part he is content to beare the charges the firſt moneth, but that the reſt ſhould be maintained at the coſts of the cleargie, and for that hee would neuer expect the Popes licenſe.</p>
               <p>When the King had ſtaied in ſilence to heare what they would ſay, they began to finde the matter ſtrange. Then the King with a token of indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation cried out, it had been better (ſaid hee) then to haue beleeued mee: I feare me, that when we goe about to put away the preaching, we will ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard the Maſſe. I were better then to make peace: and I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they will accept it when wee will proffer it: ſo the meeting was ended.</p>
               <p>The Prieſts being well ſtoared (be like) prouided within few daies vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarilie (yet more willing to haue paied nothing) one milion of frankes for their portion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:8966:27"/>
Whileſt theſe things were a dooing, the King had ſent three Noble men to the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> to wit the Lords <hi>Leuoncourt, Poigny</hi> and the preſident <hi>Barlart,</hi> to trie their cunning, whether they might induce the ſaid <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1585.

Theſe Lords came to the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> after his returne from S. <hi>Paul de Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dioulx</hi> to <hi>Nerak,</hi> greeting him in the Kings name: declared to him, how the King did hold him as his ſonne and heire of the crowne, in caſe he ſhould deceaſe without iſſue.</p>
               <p>And after they ſhewed the cauſes which moued the King to ioyne with the League, which was the diuiſion of the Catholiks, which would redound greatly to the preiudice of his eſtate, and the vnquietnes of his Realme.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that for the loue hee bare to him, hee wiſheth him reunited to the Catholick faith, both for the good of his ſoule, and alſo that hee might the more eaſily, by the meanes of the Catholicks be eſtabliſhed in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, which otherwiſe would be hard for him to bring to paſſe.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, they goe about to perſwade him to cauſe the exerciſe of the reformed religion to ceaſe, during the tearme of ſixe moneths perfixed.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, they required him in the Kings name, to ſurrender the townes which he did hold for the King.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> with like courteſies anſwereth to the firſt, that if it had been his Maieſties pleaſure to haue vſed his ſeruice in the ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the Leaguers, he would haue ſhewed a proofe of his duetifull obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence towards him.</p>
               <p>To the ſecond he anſwered, that from his cradle, he hath been brought vp in the reformed religion, in the which hee neuer knew any errour, and yet hath, and dooth proffer himſelfe to bee taught by the word of God, in a lawfull councell.</p>
               <p>To the third demaund hee anſwered, that the reformed religion, was eſtabliſhed by a ſolemne edict, confirmed by an oath, and that it was not in his power to let the exerciſe of the ſame: &amp; therefore purpoſed to deale in that matter.</p>
               <p>To the fourth hee anſwered, that conſidering the mallice of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies towardes him he hath more neede to require others, then to ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thoſe.</p>
               <p>Theſe Ambaſſadors alſo mooued the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> that if he would conferre with the <hi>Q.

               <p>Good Chriſtian Reader I beſeech thee to ſtay here a while, and learne both to feare and tremble at the dreadfull iudgementes of God, and alſo his mercie toward his Church, ſhewed at this time: which when I do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, it putteth me in remembrance of the like euent, which did happen a litle while afore the ſiege and deſtructions of <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> by <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> his ſonne. That citie, which here on earth had borne the Image of the true heauenly <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> hauing moſt wilfully reſiſted the ſonne of God, &amp; ſtopped their eares at his voyce. When it had fulfilled the meaſure of her iniquity, and that God would make it a wonder, a hiſſyng and nod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the head vnto all Nations of the world for her obſtinacie and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankefulnes: a litle before the ſiege, there was at midnight heard a voice
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:8966:28"/>
in the Temple thus, <hi>Migremns hinc:</hi> at the rumor thereof all men were greatly amazed, muſing what ſhould be ſignifyed by that warning. The Saints which were there, tooke that to be the voyce of God (who accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1585. Auguſt"/> to the threatninges of the law of the Prophets, and of Chriſt againſt that City, would powre downe his wrath vpon that ſinfull City) directed vnto them, commaunding them to depart, and to geue place vnto hys wrath. So the Church that was there remoued to the City <hi>Pella,</hi> which was beyond <hi>Iordan,</hi> in the ancient inheritance of the Rubenites, where it was preſerued, and out of a place of ſafety, did behold the mighty ſtormes of Gods tempeſtes, which fel vpon that ſo noble and famous a City, which by <hi>Strabo</hi> was thought to be the greateſt and fayreſt of all the Eaſt. Euen as <hi>Abraham</hi> long before did behold the ſubuerſion of <hi>Sodom:</hi> ſo when the Lord had determined to powre the ſtormes of his anger vpon thoſe Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which are betweene the <hi>Loyre</hi> and the Engliſh Seas, for their offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces lyke vnto them of <hi>Hieruſalem:</hi> firſt hee taketh his Church, which was ſcattered among thoſe Nations, Townes, and Cities, and bringeth moſt of them beyond <hi>Loyre,</hi> ſome into <hi>England,</hi> ſome to <hi>Sedan,</hi> ſome to <hi>Geneua,</hi> ſome to <hi>Suiſſerland,</hi> ſome to <hi>Germany,</hi> leaſt the preſence of them who do call vpon his name ſhould hinder the execution of his wrath vpon his enemies, for the publication of the edict of vnion, commonly called the edict of Iuly, although that in another forme, was as it were the voyce of God heard out of the Temple, <hi>Migremus hinc.</hi> For thoſe nations lying on the North ſide of <hi>Loyre,</hi> who had conſpired to deſtroy the Goſpell of Chriſt, haue drawen the warre from the Prouinces which doe profeſſe the Goſpell, vpon their owne heads. For not onely haue they felt all the former oppreſſions and outrages of the Leaguers, but alſo by this edict, all the burthen of this laſt ciuill warre rayſed vp by the Leaguers hath fallen, vpon them, beſide the horrible murthers and ſeditions, which they haue committed among themſelues by the euill Angels, which the Lord in his wrath hath ſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them: which alſo do continue ſtill with greater calamities then euer before, and is like to continue vntill that thoſe wicked Nations, polluted with idolatrie, blood of the ſayntes, and whoredome, be vtterly rooted out, that God may be auenged of his enemies: giuing in the meane tyme a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle reſt vnto the reformed churches beyond <hi>Loyre,</hi> and to make them thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for his great mercyes, who hath rewarded his enemies with euil, which they had imagined agaynſt his people without a cauſe. So the Lord doth turne all thinges to good vnto his Sayntes.</p>
               <p>Now the Leaguers are maſters of all (for the king had deliuered his royall authority vnto them, and deuided his kingdome among them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruing vnto himſelfe the name of a King) haue all the Countrey at theyr deuotion, and do repleniſh all <hi>France</hi> with armes, violence and boaſtings.

               <p>The Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> turned from Saint <hi>Paul Decadewalx</hi> to Saynt <hi>Ihan D' Angelye,</hi> hauing aſſembled ſome friends, as wel out of <hi>Xainctonge, Poytow,</hi> as other parts, within few dayes ſaw himſelfe to haue a luſty com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany as well of gentlemen as Harquebuſiers on horſebacke, and with that force expecting the reſt, tooke his iourney with as much diligence as hee could to meete with the ſayd <hi>Mercure.</hi>

This increaſed his feare ſo much the more, for that hee had not ſo ſoone heard of the Princes comming, but that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently hee was certifyed that the ſaid Prince was in battell array. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he reſolued to retyre home: but being hardly preſſed by the ſayd prince he was fayne to retire to <hi>Fontenay.</hi> And becauſe the gouernor of the towne knowing not well how thinges had paſſed betweene the King and the Leaguers, would not ſuffer him nor his to enter the towne (yet otherwiſe ſhewing him ſuch fauors as he might:) therfore he with his troups betook themſelues to the Suburbe of <hi>Fontenay</hi> called the <hi>Loges.</hi>

               <p>The Prince deſirous to ſee his enemy face to face, aduanced toward the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Septēb. 4"/> Suburbe in battaile aray, to prooue whether he might prouoke the enemy to ſkirmiſh. But the Duke would none of that play. But after the Prince had kept the Duke beſieged in the <hi>Loges</hi> for certaine dayes, the ſaid Duke fearing, eyther at length to be forced, or elſe that the Prince would cut his way in his returne to <hi>Nantes,</hi> by night ſecretly did ſteale away, and with the mayne galop, amaze and many alarms which he gaue to himſelf (feare making him to imagine thinges which were not) recouered to <hi>Nantes</hi>

Some of the Princes companies purſued the diſaray, and ſetting vpon the carriage tooke it, and many priſoners with it. Thus hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily ſucceded the beginnings of the vnion, and the miracles of theſe great Captaines, whoſe heat was ſome what cooled, and their hornes beaten in with this blow.</p>
               <p>About the 5. day of September, the Prince returning from <hi>Fonteney,</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> paſſed through <hi>Mele,</hi> where the Countrey of <hi>Rochefocault,</hi> which not long before had repayred to him, left him againe taking his iourney to his own houſe.

               <p>About the 9. of September, from <hi>Iarnak,</hi> the Lord Saint <hi>Gelays,</hi> with the Lord <hi>D'Aubigny,</hi> and ſome other Gentlemen tooke their iourney to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Mele,</hi> for ſome great affaires. There they had knowledge, that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine companies of the League were comming to compaſſe them about: which thing being found true, the Lord S. <hi>Gelays</hi> Marſhal of the Princes campe, ſendeth all night to the Lord <hi>Charboniere,</hi> who was two leagues of with his companie: hee ſendeth alſo to certaine Gentlemen there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts, who were of the religion: which with great diligence came toward him all night, and at the breake of the day, ioyned with the ſaid Lord Saint <hi>Gelays.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Leagued companies were conducted by Captaine Saint <hi>Katari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,</hi> and others who perceauing themſelues on a ſuddaine, and beſide their expectation compaſſed about, without any further a doo required parley

Many of theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies went to the Prince, being then at <hi>Pons:</hi> they which would not, were ſent away without weapons. And this is the ſecond miracle which the Leaguers did in <hi>Poytow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About the ſame time, the Lord Saint <hi>Meſmes, Ranques</hi> and <hi>Orges,</hi> went toward <hi>Tonnecharante,</hi> at whoſe approaching the Lord Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> who was then at <hi>Soubize,</hi> with nigh two hundred Souldiours, with great terrour departed: and burning the bridge and gate of <hi>Soubize</hi> retired to <hi>Browage,</hi> leauing moſt of all his gariſons at the bourg of <hi>Moſes.</hi> Theſe Lords mought haue purſued &amp; taken the Lord Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> but delaying the time, from Friday to Sunday, they loſt the occaſion.</p>
               <p>The 13. day, theſe Lords tooke the tower of <hi>Foncras,</hi> vpon <hi>Charante,</hi> which did holde for the League. About the ſame time, the Prince of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de,</hi>

               <p>About the 15. of September the Lords Saint <hi>Meſmes, Ranques,</hi> and <hi>Orges,</hi> after the taking of the Tower of <hi>Foncras</hi> vpon <hi>Charante,</hi> purſued <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> the Gariſon which had fled from <hi>Soubieze,</hi> and had ſtayed at the bourg of <hi>Moſes</hi> (as is ſaid) betweene <hi>Soubieze</hi> and <hi>Browage,</hi> and followed them to a place called <hi>Graund</hi> Gariſon, right againſt <hi>Browage</hi> on the north ſide of the riuer: where after they had ſkirmiſhed a while in the ſight of the towne, and of the Lord Saint <hi>Luk,</hi> who was on the other ſide of the water, on the key of <hi>Browage,</hi> and being reduced there at the low water, and hardly ſet on by them of the religion: through diſpayre of reſcue, caſt themſelues in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ooſe, where the moſt part were ſlaine: others that could not get out were drowned when the tide came.</p>

The Lord Saint <hi>Luk</hi> was in great agonie, to ſée the beſt of all his Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons ſo caſt away, without any remedie to ſaue one of them: certaine ſhot <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1585.

               <p>About the ſame time the Lord <hi>Clermont</hi> enterpriſed to paſſe ouer <hi>Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,</hi> with few with him, among whome was one Captaine <hi>Rochemorte,</hi> for to aſſemble them who could not dwell in their houſes, by reaſon of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication of the edict of vnion.</p>

               <p>Betweene <hi>Marennes</hi> and <hi>Hyers,</hi> there is a little creeke to paſſe ouer, which cannot bee paſſed on foote but at lowe water, which is called <hi>le paſse d'hiers.</hi> The Lord of Saint <hi>Luk</hi> had fortified the ſame with a barricado, intending there to ſhut vp the paſſage to <hi>Hyers,</hi> and conſequently to <hi>Brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age:</hi> there he placed three hundred ſhot, &amp; a few horſes, he himſelfe ſtaying at <hi>Hyers,</hi> about halfe a mile diſtant from <hi>Browage,</hi> to let the approaching of the Prince.</p>
               <p>The 19. of September, the Prince being at Saint <hi>Just,</hi> a mile and a halfe from <hi>Marennes,</hi> ſet all things in order, for the ſiege of the ſaid <hi>Brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,</hi> and about three a clock being low water, hee marched toward <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rennes,</hi> commanded his gardes and other Gentlemen, who marched a foote, to ſet vpon the barricado, which was made at the <hi>paſſe d'hiers,</hi> where they found ſome reſiſtance, there was wounded <hi>Bargnobet,</hi> Captaine of his garde, another Gentleman ſlaine.</p>

In the meane time the Lorde <hi>Boulay,</hi> commaunded to charge of another ſide, from Saint <hi>Iust</hi> tooke his way through the Salins, a way not vſed to trauaile through at all, and with his band of armed men: with a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1585.

They which were at the <hi>paſſe d'hiers,</hi> ſeeing their Captaine to flee, followed him, accompanied with terrour and dread. They were purſued nigh to the gates of <hi>Browage,</hi> though they were defenſed with ſhot of Ordinance from the townes, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them that purſued. So that within an houre and a halfe, both the <hi>paſſe</hi> and towne <hi>D'hiere</hi> came into the Princes power: the Prince lodged at <hi>Marinnes,</hi> diſtant from <hi>Hyers</hi> about a mile.</p>
               <p>Theſe eaſie and proſperous ſucceſſes and beginnings, made the Prince to conſider more touching the ſiege of that towne of <hi>Browage,</hi> conſidering alſo that there was not within great power of men, neither had they great ſtoare of victuals, candell, freſh water, neither medicins for them that were hurt.</p>
               <p>The 20. of September, there was continuall ſkirmiſhes before the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> towne, in the which ſome of the Princes ſide were hurt, many of the beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged ſlaine, one of the Captaines which the Lord <hi>Orges</hi> had ſent home be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, a man much eſteemed by the Lorde Saint <hi>Luk,</hi> becauſe of his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.</p>
               <p>The ſame day was taken the Tower of <hi>Mornake,</hi> where the Lord of S. <hi>Luke</hi> had put garriſon, which was beſieged by certayne Companyes whom the Prince had ſent thether. The garriſon withſtood for certayne dayes: but being without hope of helpe and in danger to be forced, yéelded themſelues by compoſition. There was taken the Captayne <hi>Iohn Peter,</hi> who was in great fauour with the Lord S. <hi>Luke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About that time arriued to the Prince at <hi>Marans,</hi> the Lord <hi>Lauall</hi> with his thrée brethren and all his forces.</p>
               <p>The 22. of September, the Lord <hi>Trimouille</hi> (who long before had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22"/> in communication with the Prince, to ioyne with him in this iuſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence agaynſt the League) came to <hi>Marennes</hi> with a great number of Gentlemen. The Prince receaued theſe Noble men with great courteſie and reioyſing. There was a great contentation thereof in all them of the reformed religion, for the good hope which they had conceaued of that yong Lord that he would embrace the religion, as he did ſhortly after, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing obtayned great reputation among all men for his valour and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie.</p>
               <p>The ſame day arriued to the Prince certayne ſhips of warre from <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel,</hi> ſo that by theſe meanes the ſea and the riuer of <hi>Browage</hi> were ſhut vp:
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:8966:31"/>
which thing doubled the feare of the beſieged. The Prince ſeeing his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe to ſuccéede better than he had hoped, began to enterpriſe further, and determined to preſſe the beſieged néerer, knowing that there was not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1585.

               <p>The Lords S. <hi>Gelayſe</hi> and <hi>Boyſduly</hi> were lodged in the houſe called <hi>Blanchardier,</hi> out of the Towne of <hi>Hyers,</hi> there appoynted by the Prince to prouide for neceſſaries and inunition. They did what they could, but not what they would: wherevpon the Souldiers ſeeing that they were like to ſtay there ſome time at that ſiege, began to mutinie, and to aſke mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to buy victuals, which were brought there to ſell out of the Countrey, and for lacke of money began to ſteale away, vntill that a certayne ſumme of money was gotten out of the Ilands, and ſome Gentlemen alſo did lend ſome: by which meanes the Prince muſtered, and the Souldiers ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king pay tooke alſo courage, ſkirmiſhing daily in the Marſh out of the Towne.</p>
               <p>It is ſayd before how the Lord S. <hi>Meſmes, Ranques,</hi> and <hi>Orges,</hi> tooke S. <hi>Ihan d'Angely</hi> and <hi>Soubize,</hi> and diſcomfited the Popiſh gariſon in their flight right agaynſt <hi>Browage.</hi> From thence the ſayd Lords with their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies paſſed in certayne ſhips of <hi>Rochel</hi> into the Iland of <hi>Oleron.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About the 24. of September, the Lord <hi>Ranques</hi> (who was beſt to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund there) tooke vppon the Coaſts of the ſayd Iland the maſter of the field of the Lord <hi>Matignon</hi> gouernour of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> named <hi>Beaumont,</hi> accompanied with a certayne Captayne of <hi>Browage</hi> named <hi>Thiebert:</hi> there was in that ſhippe as well Gentlemen as other Souldiers, to the number of 22. they came from the Lord <hi>Matignon</hi> then reſident at <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux,</hi> about the ſuccour for <hi>Browage.</hi> They were in a ſhip of warre, and were ſet on by thrée little ſhippes of the ſayd Lord <hi>Ranques,</hi> who enforced them to flée, and at length they caſt themſelues into the Sea to recouer the Iland of <hi>Oleron,</hi> and ſo ſeazed vpon a houſe to defend themſelues. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing purſued and compaſſed about by the ſayd Lord <hi>Ranques,</hi> at length they yéelded themſelues.

               <p>The 25. the Prince began to fortifie a houſe a little aboue the Waren <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> in the high way from <hi>Hyers</hi> to <hi>Browage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wee haue ſayd how about the 15. of September the Lord <hi>Clermont</hi> departed from the Prince at <hi>Pons,</hi> and paſſed the riuer <hi>Loyre</hi> at a place cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Roſiers,</hi> thence paſſing through a place <hi>la clouſiere des montils,</hi> to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent

to paſſe vnknowne, did fayne himſelfe to be Secretary to the King of <hi>Nauarre:</hi> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence he taketh his way to <hi>Bange,</hi> where <hi>Rochemort</hi> depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from him. The ſayd <hi>Rochemort</hi> taketh his way to <hi>Beaufort,</hi> which is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1585.

               <p>
                  <hi>Beaufort</hi> is a little Towne betwéene <hi>Loyre</hi> and <hi>Angers,</hi> which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded by a Caſtle of a reaſonable ſtrength, which did hold for the king, and was in the kéeping of Captayne <hi>Broke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rochemort</hi> arriued thether, and viſiting his friends, who were the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt of the Towne, and among them alſo Captayne <hi>Broke,</hi> by their ſpée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches he vnderſtood the ſtate of <hi>Angers,</hi> and the particularities there about the Caſtle. There was a Captayne named <hi>Halot,</hi> who had the kéeping of the ſayd Caſtle of <hi>Angers,</hi> whileſt the Lord <hi>Buſſy</hi> of <hi>Amboyſe</hi> liued, which had the gouernment of the Countrey, Citie and Caſtle, during the life of <hi>Monſieur</hi> the Kings brother. But after the death of the ſayd <hi>Buſſy,</hi> the Lord <hi>Briſſack</hi> had the gouernment, and had put out of the Caſtle the ſayd <hi>Halot,</hi> whereof by all meanes he ſought to bee reuenged, and to ſurprize the Caſtle. And to bring this thing to paſſe, he acquainted himſelfe with Captayne <hi>Freſne,</hi> who had commanded ouer a companie of <hi>Briſſack</hi> at the beginning of the League. This <hi>Briſſack</hi> was one of the chiefeſt of the League, and diſcharged the ſayd <hi>Freſne</hi> (after the edict of vnion was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed) in Iuly before: for the which thing <hi>Freſne</hi> was greatly offended with <hi>Briſſack.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe two Captaynes conſented together to enterprize vpon the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtell, and repayred to <hi>Beaufort</hi> to Captayne <hi>Broke</hi> to haue of him ſome company of men, where they met with <hi>Rochemort:</hi> and after certayne ſpéeches, opened vnto him their enterprize; who promiſed to furniſh them with certayn men. <hi>Rochemort</hi> aduertized the Lord <hi>Clermont,</hi> praying him to ſend him men, which ſhortly after ſent him foure ſtout Souldiers.</p>
               <p>This their counſell was wonderfully diſguiſed, as alſo the eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts fel out to be ſtraunge and tragicall: for <hi>Halot</hi> (as he ſayd) would recouer the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtell for the King, of whom (ſayd he) he had letters to that effect, to recouer the ſayd Caſtle out of the hands of <hi>Briſſack,</hi> who was of the League, as is afore ſayd: but indéede he reſpected himſelfe, thinking thereby to get the Kings, or the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> his fauour. Captayne <hi>Freſne</hi> was deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to be reuenged of <hi>Briſſack</hi> at any price whatſoeuer. Theſe two were ſure to haue men for the moſt part Papiſts. <hi>Rochemort</hi> was in good hope that if he could get in the Caſtle, he would finde the meanes to make it fall into the hands of the King of <hi>Nauarre. Halot</hi> &amp; <hi>Freſne</hi> doo promiſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, that if <hi>Rochemort</hi> being the weakeſt and an <hi>Hugonet,</hi> ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to innouate any thing, they could eaſily diſpatch him: ſo that vnder

The day therefore prefixed, hee goeth to ſee Captayne <hi>Greeke</hi> his friend, who then commaunded in the Caſtle with ten or twelue Souldiers. The ſayd Captayne <hi>Greeke</hi> biddeth <hi>Freſne</hi> to dinner: <hi>Freſne</hi> excuſed himſelfe that he had company, with whom he had promiſed to dine that day. Captaine <hi>Greeke</hi> preſſeth him and prayeth him to bring his company with him. <hi>Freſne</hi> had afore hand woon ſome of the gard, whom he had made priuie to the enterprize; he prayeth them of the ſecond garde to let in them of his company, whom he aſſured to be of his acquaintance: but ſome of the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers miſtruſting, went about to ſhut the gate: <hi>Rochemort</hi> and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie withſtoode them, and taking weapons in hand did kill ſome of the garde. Captaine <hi>Freſne</hi> went vp into the Captaines chamber, who hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the fray would haue gone foorth; but being encountred by the ſayd <hi>Freſne</hi> was ſlaine.</p>
               <p>Captaine <hi>Halot</hi> ſeeing the tumult, in ſtead to enter into the Caſtle, ran into the Towne, and vpon the rumour of the ſurprizing of the Caſtle, bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the Citizens not to ſtirre, for he had (ſaith he) cauſed the Caſtle to be taken for the King: but incontinently he was taken priſoner by the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Freſne</hi> and <hi>Rochemort</hi> being maſters of the Caſtell, the alarme was very hot in the towne: notice was giuen euery where in great dilligence. <hi>Rochemort</hi> forgetteth not to ſend to the Lord <hi>Clermont,</hi> to certify him, what was paſſed, deſiring him to ſend greater forces, &amp; alſo to ſend word to the Prince.</p>
               <p>Whileſt theſe newes flye euery where, diuers euents happened, which deceaued both them and others. They of the towne greeued to haue that thorne in their heeles: ſleep not, but take armes, beſet the Caſtel, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a whyle haue ſuccour of the Nobilitie of the countrey. In the euening the inhabitantes would fayne haue parley with <hi>Freſne,</hi> and vſed the means of <hi>Halot,</hi> for to draw him forth of the Caſtell, hauing placed in the darke of the night nigh the bridge 30. or 40. ſouldiers with Caliuers, either for to take him, or elſe to ſeaze vpon the drawing bridge, when he ſhould come forth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Freſne</hi> vpon this parley going forth, and being yet vpon the bridge, one of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſouldiers haſting to ſhoot, <hi>Freſne</hi> would haue returned in, but <hi>Roche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mort</hi> with his company ſeeing the perill, did draw the bridge. <hi>Freſne</hi> not able to recouer the drawing, held faſt at the chayns: they without, cut off his handes: ſo hee fell into the ditch, which was very deepe, and cut in a
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:8966:33"/>
rocke: his Cloke was left hanging on the draw bridge. There was a redde Deere in the ditch, which tore him with his hornes. They of the Towne by the licence of them of the Caſtell tooke him vp with a coard: But the coard breaking, hee fell downe agayne, and at length was taken <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1583. Septemb."/> vp and buryed in a Chappell nigh the Caſtell.</p>
               <p>Captayne <hi>Halot</hi> within few dayes after by the towne was condemned and executed.</p>
               <p>Theſe two being dead, <hi>Rochemort</hi> a <hi>Hugonet</hi> remayned maſter of the Caſtell, whereof hee geueth notice to the Lord <hi>Clermont,</hi> who immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly diſpatched a meſſenger to the Prince being at the ſiege of <hi>Browage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The inhabitants, who could haue borne it with ſome contentation (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they knew <hi>Freſne</hi> to be a Papiſt, and that hee ſayd, he held it for the king) after his death aſked <hi>Rochemort,</hi> for whom he kept the caſtel. When he had anſwered, that it was for the king of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> they were greatly mooued, and immediatly began to make Trenches both to force the ſaid caſtel and alſo to let ſuccour from co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming in. Companyes do arriue from euery where. The Lord <hi>Bocage</hi> is ſent by the king with commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to defend the trenches without enterpriſing any thing, but onely to beſiege the caſtell vntill the Lord <hi>Ioyeuſe</hi> his comming, who ſhortly after came thither with the Lord <hi>Chaſtres.</hi> In meane time <hi>Rochemort</hi> and his companions rifled the cheſtes and treaſures of <hi>Briſſak,</hi> and other which had conueyed their goods into that fort. There was a great Bootie in plate and Iewels. Neither could it be knowen what he had done with the greate horne of Unicorne which was kept there of old.</p>
               <p>Certayne dayes being ſpent about the 29. of September in an after noone <hi>Rochemort</hi> leaning vpon one of the windowes of the Caſtell, and there ſlumbering, receaued two pellets of a gunne ſhot, whereof the one cut his throat, and the other his tongue, and ſo dyed ſhortly after without ſpeaking: ſo by his death the caſtel was left without a guyd. There were 9. Papiſtes, and 5. of the reformed Religion within which could neuer agree, but were ſtill in diſorder and confuſion: which cauſed that after the comming of the Lord <hi>Ioyeuſe,</hi> they within began to demaund parley, which continued for certayne dayes.</p>

               <p>But on the other ſide hee hoped, that being ſtrengthened by receauing the companies of the Lord <hi>Clermont,</hi> which hee had gathered (as is afore ſaid) to the number of ſixe hundred, he would be able to fight againſt whom ſoeuer.</p>
               <p>Alſo that by that new ſupplie of the Lord <hi>Clermont,</hi> and by the fauour of ſome Caſtles which fauored him vpon the <hi>Loyre,</hi> he might paſſe well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and ſo returne with greater forces to the ſiege of <hi>Browage.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>On the 7. of October, ſome captaines ſhewed themſelues vnwilling to remaine, conſidering the euents and inconueniences, which might befall in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> the abſence of the Prince: ſo that the affaires were in greater trouble, and the mindes in greater perplexitie, then before. But the Prince remedied all theſe things, as well as hee could, to ſtrengthen the ſiege: and ſent to the Uicount <hi>Turene,</hi> who was in perigord with great forces, praying him to draw neere, to fauour that ſiege. But hee could not doo it, hauing ſome occaſions in hand, and waiting for the comming of the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> out of <hi>Gaſcoyne,</hi> as it ſhall appeare hereafter.</p>
               <p>About the ſame time, the Senate of <hi>Paris,</hi> hauing conſidered vpon the Popes excommunication, giueth anſwer to the King, in the which they grieuouſly condemne the Leaguers, doo blame the King, for hauing bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the edict of peace, doo ſhew it to be impoſſible to bring to paſſe their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes, doo reprooue the Pope, for vſurping vpon Princes authorities, and the liberties of the Crowne of <hi>France,</hi> doo condemne the excomunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion worthy to be burned, counſell the King to purſue them: who haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured the ſame, and to execute iuſtice vpon them, as vpon traitors.</p>
               <p>About the ſame time, the King lead by his counſell, who for the moſt part weare of the League, and ſeruants to the <hi>Guyzes,</hi> by them was borne in hand, that they of the reformed religion had to great aduauntage, by the edict of Iulie: and that many, both of the religion and Catholikes, had flocked together to the King of <hi>Nauarre.</hi> Therefore, he ſetteth foorth a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of the edict of Iu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>It is ſayd before, how the Prince (notwithſtanding all counſell and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe to the contrarie) determined to paſſe the riuer of <hi>Loyre,</hi> all difficulties <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> therfore ſet aſide, the eight of October the Prince departed out of his camp with his companies to <hi>Taillebourg,</hi> appointing the <hi>rendes vous,</hi> at a place nigh S. <hi>Ihan d'Angely.</hi> His forces did conſiſt of the companies of the Lord <hi>Rohan,</hi> who were aboue ſixe ſcore braue Gentlemen, the companies of the Lords <hi>Nemours,</hi> &amp; <hi>Laual,</hi> who had much nobilitie with him. There were alſo the companies of the Lords <hi>Trimouille,</hi> and <hi>Boulay,</hi> &amp; his own compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, which in number and nobilitie paſſed all others. The Harquebuſiers on horſeback were they of his garde; the Regiments of the Lord <hi>Aubigny, Ouſches, Campoyſe, Touche,</hi> &amp; <hi>Fleſche,</hi> &amp; others, with many Gentlemen of <hi>Xainctonge,</hi> and <hi>Poytow,</hi> who were ſent for by the Prince, and put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vnder Noble men, as they would themſelues. The whole of his forces came to the number of eight hundred horſemen, and betweene one thouſand or twelue hundred Harquebuſiers on horſebacke. There was a great deale more carriage, than was expedient for a voyage to bee done with celeritie and diligence.</p>
               <p>The 9. day the Prince being at <hi>Taillebourg,</hi> the Artillerie which was ſent from <hi>Rochel</hi> to the ſtege of <hi>Browage,</hi> arriued in the riuer <hi>Charante,</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> to be brought againe to <hi>Rochel</hi> by Captaine <hi>Bordeaulx.</hi> For the Prince at his departing from <hi>Marans,</hi> had taken order to retire the Artillerie, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyd what might enſue, not intending to occupie it at <hi>Browage,</hi> but onely to keepe the Towne blocked vntill his returne, which hee hoped to bee ſhortly.</p>
               <p>The ſame ſame day the Prince from <hi>Taillebourg</hi> went to lodge to <hi>Ville<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neufue la conteſſe,</hi> where he vnderſtood that the Ladie <hi>Trimouille</hi> was at S. <hi>Stephen,</hi> about a league from thence, where he went to ſalute her: and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter many ſpéeches about his marriage with her daughter, the ſayd Ladie vſed many perſwaſions, to make her ſonne (the Lord <hi>Trimouille)</hi> to breake his reſolution, in the which ſhe ſawe him to embarke himſelfe on the ſide of the king of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> threatning him of her accurſe, if he procéeded further. But the ſayd yong Lord ſhewed her, with much ſubmiſſion and obeiſance, that if ſhe would weigh the reaſons, which mooued him ſo to doo, grounded vpon iuſtice and honour; and on the contrary ſide, the vniuſt cauſe of the League, he was aſſured that ſhe would turne her curſing into bleſſing: ſo that he remayned reſolute both to followe that part, and alſo not to forſake the Prince in that voyage.</p>
               <p>The tenth day of October all the companies tooke their way toward <hi>Niort, Baeſuiere, Argenton, Viers</hi> and <hi>Tence.</hi> There the Lord S. <hi>Gelayes</hi> Marſhall of the Princes campe, with the companie of the Lord <hi>Boulay,</hi> with a certaine number of Harquebuſiers on horſebacke, departed to goe

before to get the bancke of <hi>Loyre:</hi> and following the ſide of the riuer vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde, to ſearch ſome occaſion to paſſe the riuer, eyther by ſurprizing of boates or milles, met with a certaine companie of Gentlemen of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1585.

               <p>The 11. day the Lord <hi>Aubigny</hi> and <hi>Bouet</hi> tooke the ſtrong Abbey of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> S. <hi>Maure</hi> vpon the riuer of <hi>Loyre,</hi> where was a garriſon of the League. There they did no violence to the Monkes, but licenſed them to depart whether they would. They tooke the Prior and ſent him to the Prince at S. <hi>Gemes,</hi> who courteouſly entertayned him in his owne houſe, and ſafely ſent him to <hi>Angers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The 14. day Captaine <hi>Fleſche</hi> being of that countrey, had aduaunced, and began to paſſe at the towne of <hi>Roſiers:</hi> for there were no companies of the enemies on all that coaſt.

And as for the Lord <hi>Clermont,</hi> whom we haue ſayd to haue left the Prince at <hi>Pons</hi> to paſſe ouer <hi>Loyre,</hi> to gather the forces of them of the reformed religion, ſcattered in thoſe popiſh countreys, there was no more newes of him, than if he had not béen in the world: and indeed then he was aboue thirtie leagues from them. But Captaine <hi>Fleſche</hi> had ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed vppon three boates laden with wine: which after he had cauſed to bée landed vpon the water ſide, he prepared them to carrie the armie ouer.</p>
               <p>The 15. of October he paſſed firſt, and lodged at <hi>Roſiers,</hi> and after him <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> paſſed the Lord <hi>Aubiguy</hi> with his Regiment: that day the Prince arriued at S. <hi>Gemes</hi> with his troupes, which lodged in the villages about. The ſame day alſo arriued the Lords Saint <hi>Gelayſe,</hi> and <hi>Boulay,</hi> to the Prince: they had been ſcouring the waſt of the riuer. For the right vnderſtanding of this voyage, the ſituation and places of the countrey is to be noted. In all this diſcourſe, we will make mention of three riuers, the <hi>Loyre, Lolion,</hi> and <hi>Loir.</hi> On the South ſide of <hi>Loyre</hi> there bee two townes, <hi>Samur</hi> and <hi>Pont de ſell:</hi> betwéene theſe two townes there be foure other litle townes, the Abbey of <hi>Planpierd,</hi> S. <hi>Gemes,</hi> the Abbey of S. <hi>Maure,</hi> and S. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thurine.</hi> On the North ſide of the riuer, <hi>Loyre</hi> right againſt S. <hi>Gemes</hi> is the towne <hi>Roſiers,</hi> and betwéene theſe two townes in the riuer is an Iland: in this place paſſed ouer the Prince and his armie. The next riuer on the North ſide of <hi>Loyre</hi> is <hi>Lolion,</hi> a little riuer, but very déepe, and running ſlowly; it waſheth part of <hi>

middle way betweene the ſayd riuer and <hi>Angers,</hi> is ſituated the towne of <hi>Beaufort.</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1585. October"/>
               </p>
               <p>The third riuer is <hi>Loire,</hi> falling from the countrey of <hi>Beauſe</hi> through <hi>Vandomoys</hi> &amp; <hi>Anjou,</hi> receauing 2. other riuers comming from the countrey called <hi>Perche,</hi> which are <hi>Sarthre,</hi> and <hi>Huyne,</hi> and a little aboue <hi>Angers</hi> do fall into the riuer <hi>Loyre,</hi> and ſomewhat beneath <hi>Angers:</hi> theſe three riuers in one are receaued into the riuer <hi>Mayne,</hi> and ſo altogether in one about 2. miles beneath <hi>Angers,</hi> &amp; 3. miles beneath <hi>Pont de Sell,</hi> do run into <hi>Loyre.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Vpon this riuer of <hi>Loyre</hi> are ſituated theſe townes following, <hi>Fleſche, Lude, Lauerdine, Chaſtean de Loyre, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>endoſme</hi> &amp; <hi>Chaſteaudine.</hi> Betwéene <hi>Chasteaudine,</hi> and <hi>Reiſgencye,</hi> which lyeth vpon <hi>Loyre,</hi> betweene <hi>Orleance,</hi> and <hi>Bloys,</hi> is the Towne Foreſt of <hi>Morcheſuoyr:</hi> in that Foreſt was the army of the Prince ſcattered (and as it were) became inuiſible, as ſhall be ſhewed in the diſcourſe following.</p>
               <p>The 16. of October, the whole army began to paſſe ouer with great diſcommodity. For from Saint <hi>Gemes</hi> they had but three meane boats, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> wherwith they paſſed into the Iland which lyeth in the midle of the riuer. On the other ſide of the Iland to paſſe to the towne of <hi>Roſiers,</hi> they had but two boats, and few Ferry-men, who were Papiſtes, they did the woorſt they could, and ready at euery hand to ſteale away. Theſe diſcommodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties cauſed great confuſion at the paſſage, which was encreaſed with a great number of cariages which followed the Campe.</p>
               <p>At this paſſage, euery man did preſage the euill ſucceſſe which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward enſued. For although there was no want of corage, yet one might perceaue a certayne ſadnes vnaccuſtomed, which cauſed many to ſay, let vs goe and dye: for euery man was reſolued to vanquiſh or to dye. But the Lord diſpoſed otherwiſe: for a more meru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>lous deliuerance hath not béen ſeene in our dayes. For neither did they vanquiſh, neither dyed, but euery one dranke a reaſonable draught of the cuppe of bitternes.</p>
               <p>At this paſſage did ariſe great diuerſity of opinions among the heads: for none of the Captaynes thought good, that the Prince ſhould paſſe ouer for the care which they had of his ſafety, &amp; their reaſons were, that it was moſt like, that the enemie would not withſtand their paſſage, but would winke at it, that afterwardes they might bring all their forces together to ſtop their returne, thinking it an eaſy thing with many to ouercome few. For they had already newes that <hi>Ioyeuſe</hi> haſted to <hi>Angers,</hi> with all his forces, which were about three hundred Horſes, twelue hundred of <hi>Suiſſers,</hi> and ſome regiments of Frenchmen. They alleaged alſo, that there was nothing ſure at <hi>Angers,</hi> and that it was to be feared, that it would be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendered before they could aryue thither, ſo that their paſſing ouer ſtood vpon no reaſon, but vpon an vncertaynty to venture ſuch an army with all the ſtate of their defeuce. There was alſo newes brought to them (though
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:8966:36"/>
falſe) that <hi>Briſſake</hi> had ſeazed vpon <hi>Beaufort,</hi> a towne betweene the riuer <hi>Lotion,</hi> and <hi>Angers,</hi> whither the Prince thought to haue gone to lodge that day. The 17 of October, notwithſtanding the reaſons aforeſayd, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1585. Octob."/> the Prince paſſed ouer at the town <hi>Roſiers</hi> with ſome noble men and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynes, where he took about thirty gentlemen of the company of the Lord <hi>Boulaye,</hi> who was already paſſed, and certayne Harquebuſiers with him, commaunding them to lye in ambuſh in a wood nigh <hi>Beaufort,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded the Lord <hi>Valiere,</hi> who was among the ſaid gentlemen, to make ſemblance towardes the gates of <hi>Beaufort,</hi> and to draw them who ſhould iſſue out into the aduantage of them which lay in ambuſh in the wood. But when they came to <hi>Beaufort,</hi> there they found none but the inhabitantes who did profer their Towne to the Prince, and aſſured that there came no man except the County <hi>Carauas,</hi> to whom they denyed entrance.</p>
               <p>Upon this report the Prince determined to paſſe the reſt of his army, grounded vpon many reaſons: but eſpecially vpon the newes which he had receaued of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Lord <hi>Clermont,</hi> whom he had heard to be about <hi>Angers,</hi> with ſixe or ſeauen hundred men: who was not willing notwithſtanding that the Prince ſhould encloſe himſelfe in that ſleeue.</p>
               <p>All this while the Lord <hi>Rohan</hi> with his company made a road toward <hi>Saumur,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Laual</hi> downe the riuer toward <hi>Angers,</hi> for he paſſed laſt of all.</p>
               <p>The Prince alſo ſendeth a trompet vnder the colour of certayne priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, to know of <hi>Angers</hi> what hee might. But they of <hi>Angers</hi> would not ſuffer him to goe further then the Suburbs, who reported onely that they which kept the Trenches were reſolued to ſtand to their defence man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.</p>
               <p>Few dayes the Prince <hi>Monpenſier</hi> had gone to <hi>Angers</hi> to profer his ſeruice: but within few dayes he went away diſcontented, becauſe they of the citie had preferred the Lord <hi>Bocage</hi> before him: which thing cauſed ſome to thinke, that the ſayd Prince <hi>Monpenſier</hi> would ioyne with the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> conſidering that this warre was agaynſt the League: and for the ſame cauſe the Lord <hi>Auantignie</hi> was ſent to him from the Prince: but all was in vayne.</p>
               <p>The 18. the reſt of the companies paſſed all ouer <hi>Loyre</hi> with leaſure, but with much diſcommodity, by reaſon of the great continuall rayne. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="18"/>
               </p>
               <p>The Prince left Captaine <hi>Serpent</hi> with a ſtronge garriſon at the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey of Saint <hi>Maure,</hi> to fortify the paſſage, and to fauour their repaſſing at their returne.</p>
               <p>The 19. they departed from <hi>Roſiers,</hi> to paſſe the riuer <hi>Lotion,</hi> which ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth betweene <hi>Loyre,</hi> and the towne <hi>Beaufort,</hi> a riuer narrow, but very déep, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19"/> then ſpecially, which for the great aboundant rayne, was ouer the bankes. There the paſſage was more troubleſome then at <hi>Loyre,</hi> becauſe the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey

all about is coppſes and Mariſhes daungerous for the horſemen.</p>
               <p>They of <hi>Beaufort</hi> being ſo mened to open the gates to the Prince, did it without any delay, and taking away their Gard, receaued ſuch as were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1585.

Thether the Prince arryued the ſame day at eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with his army, and left the Lord <hi>Laual</hi> for the ſafety of theyr paſſage of <hi>Lotion,</hi> who came to the Prince the next day after.</p>
               <p>The ſame day about noone, the Lord <hi>Clermont</hi> came to the Prince at <hi>Beaufort</hi> with thirty horſes: his horſemen were about nine hundred, &amp; lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in the villages betwéene <hi>Beaufort</hi> and <hi>Angers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The twentéeth day being the Lordes day, they ſoiorned at <hi>Beaufort,</hi> and the night following they began to march toward <hi>Angers,</hi> and appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> the <hi>rendes vous</hi> at a certayne place within a league of <hi>Angers.</hi>

               <p>The Lord <hi>Ioyeuſe</hi> vnderſtanding the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> to bee at hand, (fearing leaſt hee might enterprize vpon the Caſtell, by the helpe of thoſe few men, being onely 16. in all) by reaſon that he thought them to bee of the religion, or otherwiſe to fauour the Prince, and that thence he might moleſt the League, and hold the whole countrey in ſubiection, he thought that it were not good to delay the regayning of the ſayd Caſtel: but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer it at any price whatſoeuer. Therefore he conditioned with them who were within, that the Papiſtes which were there nine in number, might there remayne, if they thought it good. They of the religion 7. in number ſhould be ſafely conducted to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Princes camp, and that they ſhould not bee ſearched. Alſo that they might carry away what they would.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, that at their going away out of the Caſtell, they of the League ſhould all retyre away.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all, that euery one ſhould haue one thouſand crownes in money, and a good Horſe, with a pardon from the king, and ſecurity, that they ſhould neuer be called to any accompt, all theſe Promiſes were faythful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kept to them.</p>
               <p>At their comming foorth they deuided amongeſt their friendes the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uable goods of <hi>Briſſak,</hi> as Plate, Aras, and other ſuch thinges as they could not cary, and loded themſelues with the beſt iewels, as much as they could carry away.</p>
               <p>The 21. of October, the Princes companies began to march from the campe, where the <hi>rendes vous</hi> was giuen through a narrow way, toward the place of execution, nigh the Suburbes. There by the forrunners were three ſouldiours taken, not ſuppoſing the enemie to haue been ſo nigh: who reported that the Trenches were very ſtrong, and would be ſtoutely defended. They alſo tooke certaine peaſants; who reported <hi>Rochemort</hi> to be dead, and the caſtell to be ſurrendered for a great ſomme of money: but they were not belieued.</p>
               <p>The ſame day the Prince ſent certaine Harquebuſiers to <hi>Pontdeſel</hi>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:8966:37"/>
which is a towne ſituated vpon the fall of <hi>Lolion</hi> into <hi>Loyre,</hi> where is a bridge to paſſeouer the riuer, where they of <hi>Angers</hi> had put a ſtrong gari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to keepe the bridge. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1585. Octob."/>
               </p>
               <p>At the diſcouering of the approache of the Princes power, both the towne, and alſo the caſtell gaue a hot alarum, and ſounded the Toxin in all the pariſh Churches of the Citie, and alſo at the high church, called Saint <hi>Maurice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was a maruelous thing, that in ſo great and populous a Citie, wherein were more men of warre ſtrangers, then the Prince had in all his armie, yet no ſallie out was made, no more then if there had beene no man; conſidering alſo that the place where the Prince was in battell aray, did fauour greatly them of the towne: for there was but a broad way where the horſemen onely ſtoode, and on both ſides were vineyards and copſes. In that broad way, were ſet in battell aray all the Harquebuſiers: where the Miniſter of the church, L. <hi>Blanchardiere</hi> pronounced a forme of praier before the army. And vpon this preparation, were receaued certaine newes of the rendering of the Caſtel the day before: which thing made all men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue it, becauſe that at the ariuing of the armie, there was no taken from thence (notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding the alarum, &amp; pieces of ſhot giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out.) Others that were againſt that opinion alleaged, that it was no maruaile if they did not diſcharge the canon out of the Caſtell, becauſe they were ſo few, that they were not able to remoue it. They added alſo, that the fire which they of the towne had ſet to an houſe, betweene the armie and the Caſtell, which continued all the day by the ſmoake, was to let them of the Caſtell, to ſee the troupes which came to ſuccour them. Vpon theſe coniectures, the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines (according to the commandements receaued) ſet vpon the ſubburbs of <hi>Paſſiguie,</hi> and <hi>Magdalen,</hi> and forced the ſame, euen to the Bari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ados, which they of the towne had made out of the gates, within the ſubburbes, which were forſaken. There the Captaine <hi>Fleſche</hi> was wounded with a ſhot, who dyed within few dayes after; he had proteſted before, that either he would dye, or elſe he would enter the Trenches, paſſing not for death, ſeeing that it was in, and for his countrey: both hapened vnto him. Hee was borne at a towne named <hi>Fleſche,</hi> ſituated vpon the Riuer <hi>Loyre,</hi> flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from <hi>Vendoſme,</hi> to <hi>Angers,</hi> a gentleman borne of good parentage. All that day paſſed away in ſkirmiſhes, for the armie of the Prince had alſo trenched themſelues, in the ſubburb of <hi>Preſſiguy.</hi> The horſemen were al that day in battel aray, vntil nigh at the end of the ſubburbs, while the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuſiers wonne by little and little, the Trenches of the enemie, pear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the houſes, to aduaunce to the gate.</p>
               <p>That day, the Prince ſendeth his Troumpet into a medow, vnder the Caſtell, in the ſight of them that were within, to giue them token with the ſound of the Troumpet: but ſeeing no token out of the Caſtell, they began
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:8966:37"/>
to ſuſpect in deede, that the Caſtell was ſurrendered. At euening it was thought good to retyre, and that the Souldiours ſhould giue ouer their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1585. October"/> Trenches in the ſubburb and houſes which they had gotten, for feare that they within the towne in the aduauntage of the night, ſhould iſſue vpon them, being many againſt few, the towne being able to bring forth foure thouſand ſtrangers onely, beſide the forces of the towne, with the aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of their ordinance. The Lordes <hi>Trimouille, Boulay,</hi> and <hi>Auantignie,</hi> with their companies, were appointed to make the retire, which was no further then the houſes next to the ſubburb of <hi>Preſſigny.</hi> The horſemen lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged that night in the neareſt pariſhes about the Prince with his company, and the Lord <hi>Rohan</hi> dis lodge at the <hi>Pont</hi> of <hi>Sorges,</hi> not without great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, by reaſon that there was but few lodgings. In the night, they of the towne iſſued foorth, ouerthrew and burned the Trenches and Barrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does, which were made the day before, and lodged within certaine houſes in the ſubburb, euen in the hoſpitall of the leapers, ſo that they could not bee diſplaced thence the nextday.</p>
               <p>The 22. about eight a clock, the Lords <hi>Trimouille, Auantigny</hi> &amp; Saint <hi>Gelayſe,</hi> with their companies reſorted to the croſſe way, nigh the place of execution, where all companies were commaunded to appeare. Then they of the towne ſhewed a countenance, as though they would haue iſſued foorth, and certaine demilances appeared within the ſubburb of <hi>Preſſigny.</hi> There was a great alarum, which haſted the companies from their lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings, to put themſelues in battell aray, where they did the day before. Then were the footemen commaunded to ſet on the ſubburbs, but they went not to it with that courage as they had done the day before: for many had not refreſhed themſelues: ſome the day before had loſt their horſes, when they left them to fight at the Trenches: ſome did ſteale away and returned to <hi>Beaufort.</hi> The Captaines were diſcontented, that they had been enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to giue ouer the aduantage, which they had the day before within the ſubburbs: which they could not recouer without great loſſes. The armie was ſcattered here and there, the high waies were couered with bagage, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, charets, horſes, mules, ſeruants, which wandered al night, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whether to retire. To be ſhort, all things went farre otherwiſe then the day before, yet they recouered within the ſubburb as much as they could, not without hazard and difficultie.</p>
               <p>The Prince arryued from <hi>Pont Forges,</hi> and got him within the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbe of <hi>Preſsigni,</hi> where he perceaued the countenance and courage of his men chaunged and amazed: but on the contrary, them of the towne to haue taken hart. Then euery one alleaging what might haue happened to them in the Caſtel: ſome obſtinately affirmed, that they had ſhot in the night: other ſayd the contrary.</p>
               <p>The Prince aſſembled the Nobles and Captaynes at the croſſe way,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:8966:38"/>
nigh the place of execution (ſaue them which were aſſaulting y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Suburbs) on horſebacke, their helmets on: they conſulted whether they ſhould ſet on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1585. October"/> the Trenches, yea or us. Some perſwaded to giue the attempt, ſaying that it would be a ſhame, to haue come ſo farre and ſo nigh execution with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blowes giuing, and that they could doo no leſſe then to ſee the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie in the face, and ſeeing that they woulde not come foorth, they ſhould goe to finde them out: they ſaid further, that they of the Caſtell could not ſee their ſuccour, if they preſented not themſelues at the Trenches.</p>
               <p>Others reaſoned to the contrarie, and among others, the Lord <hi>Rohan</hi> withſtoode ſtrongly that aduiſe, aleaging many euident reaſons. And firſt, that it was too plaine, that they of the Caſtel had yeelded to the enemie, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing not giuen one token to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> contrarie, that it was no reaſon to ſay, that they had no knowledge of their comming, conſidering ſo many ſignes giuen them for the ſpace well neere of two daies.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that it were a raſhenes to hazard ſo great and braue forces, and ſuch a notable companie of Nobilitie, to ſo imminent danger vpon vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainties, and that they were to be reſerued to a better opportunitie. For the enemie was as ſtrong within as they were without, and that it was as eaſie to take the citie as the Trenches ſo well fortified, and that there was no hope of any to ſhew them any fauour: much leſſe out of the caſtel which was already ſurrendered, or elſe diſſembled with them, to intrap them and to caſt them away headlong.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, they ought to conſider that they were in a ſtrange land, in the enemies countrey, incloſed betweene two daungerous riuers which they muſt repaſſe, in a countrey couered with woods, enemie to the horſemen, whereof conſiſted all their forces.</p>
               <p>Finally, that there was no doubt, but that the King on the one ſide, and the League on the other were not idle, but did their endeuour to gather their forces on euery ſide, to ſeaze vpon the paſſages, and fortifie the banck of <hi>Loyre,</hi> to ſtop their repaſſing. That the forces of <hi>Angers</hi> were on their backes, which were equall in ſtrength to them, and all the countrey was fauourable to the enemie. Therefore they concluded to retyre, and that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay might bring them great hurt: and that the Lord <hi>Laual,</hi> who was at <hi>Beaufort</hi> to make the rereward, ſhould goe backe to repaſſe the <hi>Loyre.</hi> The greateſt part followed this aduiſe.</p>
               <p>It gréeued greatly the Prince to retyre, and (as hee ſayd to the Lord <hi>Clermont)</hi> to vnbit. But ouercome with reaſon, he concluded that the Lord <hi>Trimouille, Auantigny,</hi> and <hi>Boulay,</hi> ſhould retyre the Harquebuſiers from the ſuburbs, ſo that about two of the clocke in the afternoone they marched toward <hi>Beaufort.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In retyring, they firſt met with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord <hi>Laual</hi> with two hundred gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:8966:38"/>
galloping toward <hi>Angers,</hi> who being aduertized of the retyre, went neuertheleſſe forward to the Prince. In the retyring there was confuſion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1585. October"/> at <hi>Beaufort,</hi> for it was two houres within night afore they arriued there, &amp; many had but a ſhort ſupper. The ſame day the companie of Captayne <hi>Freſche</hi> (whom we haue ſayd to haue béen killed at the aſſault giuen in the ſuburbe of <hi>Preſſigny</hi> the day before) guided by his Lieftenant, was ſent to get boates for the repaſſing of <hi>Lotion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The 22. day the Prince with all the troupes ſoiourned at <hi>Beaufort,</hi> to take aduiſe how to repaſſe <hi>Loyre.</hi> There the Lord <hi>Pleſſis gete</hi> was appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſearch out boates and men to conduct them, to auoyde the diſorder which they had the firſt paſſing, and to that intent money was deliuered him.</p>
               <p>The ſame day the Lord <hi>Campoyſe</hi> was ſent with his company of light horſemen, to ſeaze vpon certayne houſes vpon the banck of <hi>Loyre,</hi> right a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt the Abbey of S. <hi>Maure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſame day, whileſt the Prince with the Nobles ſoiourned at <hi>Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,</hi> came to the Lord <hi>Clermont</hi> the foure men which he had ſent to <hi>Roche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mort,</hi> who were entered into the Caſtle of <hi>Angers,</hi> and there remayned vntill the day of the rendring thereof, conducted by the Lord <hi>Suze:</hi> There they ſhewed to the armie what was paſſed in the Caſtle of <hi>Angers:</hi> one of them ſhewed a Croſſe (which he had for his part) made of pure gold, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing two and thirtie great Diamonds, and a great Saphir which made the head of the Crucifixe: the ladder and all other things accuſtomed to be paynted in the paſſion (as they call it) was all of Diamonds, no leſſe artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, than coſtly wrought: he was proffered for the ſame fifteene hundred Crownes.</p>
               <p>The 24. of October, whileſt the Prince with many Noble men ſoiour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at <hi>Beaufort,</hi> to pacifie a quarrell riſen among certayne Gentlemen, the Lord <hi>Laual</hi> in the afternoone paſſed ouer <hi>Loyre,</hi> his me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of armes and light horſes, to defend S. <hi>Maure,</hi> and to fauour the paſſage of the reſt.</p>
               <p>This day ſoiourning at <hi>Beaufort,</hi> was the cauſe of the diſorder which followed after, and many marueiling at ſo long abode there, foreſaw what would enſue, knowing that <hi>Ioyeuſe</hi> had ſet certayne boates in a readines with ſmall peeces at <hi>Saumur,</hi> to let them downe the riuer to ſtop the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage. If they had paſſed that day and night, all things had gone well and ſafe: but God had otherwiſe determined. The ſame day the Lords <hi>Ioyeuſe,</hi> and <hi>Chaſtre,</hi> went vp the riuer <hi>Loyre</hi> on the South ſide of the ſayd riuer from <hi>Angers</hi> to <hi>Saumur</hi> with 150. horſes.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Laual</hi> being paſſed ouer, and vnderſtanding that the ſayd Lords had paſſed on that coaſt toward <hi>Saumur,</hi> early in the morning made a roade toward <hi>Saumur,</hi> and tooke the Mules and rich carriage of <hi>Ioyeuſe.</hi> The Lords <hi>Trimouille</hi> and <hi>Boyſeuly</hi> paſſed the <hi>Lotion,</hi> &amp; encamped them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:8966:39"/>
in a Common vpon the bancke of <hi>Loyre,</hi> whileſt the Prince and the reſt paſſed <hi>Lotion.</hi> There was at that paſſage of <hi>Lotion</hi> aboue fiue hundred <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1585. October"/> horſes, and two boates onely: for that cauſe the confuſion was ſo great, that one being ouerladen ſunke, though without any loſſe of men, becauſe it was nigh the bancke.</p>
               <p>The ſame day about nine of the clocke in the morning, was heard on a ſudden a peale of Ordinance, with ſome ſmall ſhot, which put the Armie in great rumour. Some ſayd that it was at <hi>Angers,</hi> in token of ioye for the rendring of the Caſtle. But within a while after were ſeene two great boates furniſhed with Ordinance and men of warre, who caſt anker a little beneath the Abbey of S. <hi>Maure,</hi> in the place where the paſſage ouer was appoynted to be, and immediatly began to ſhoote on both ſides of the riuer, both agaynſt them who had paſſed, and agaynſt them that were about to paſſe.</p>
               <p>The newes of the ſayd boates were brought to the Prince incontinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, with amplification of the impoſſibilitie to repaſſe: and it was indeede ſo, for lacke of two field péeces to haue ſhot from the banke agaynſt the boates, which by theſe meanes could haue béen eaſily ſunke: but they had carried none, although they had once determined ſo to doo.</p>
               <p>Theſe newes ſo amazed the whole Armie, as though a ſtroake of a Thunderboult had ſmitten them from heauen, and that ſo much the more, becauſe the enemies forces did flocke together from euery ſide.</p>
               <p>The army then was ſcattered in ſundry places, without hope to bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſuccour one another: for the Lord <hi>Laual</hi> had paſſed ouer the Riuer the day before, and the Lord <hi>Borlay</hi> had ventured to paſſe that day at S. <hi>Mathurin,</hi> not without great danger, yet without loſſe. The one part of the armie was betweene the <hi>Loyre,</hi> and the <hi>Lotion,</hi> an vnfit place for horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, by reaſon of woods and mariſhes. The troupes of the Lord <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> with the reſt of the armie and carriage, were yet at <hi>Beaufort,</hi> bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene <hi>Angers</hi> and <hi>Lotion:</hi> ſo that if the enemy in ſuch diſaduantage had charged them, it would haue gone hard with them: but the enemy had no good ſpials.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Auantigny</hi> in that diſorder hauing paſſed <hi>Lotion,</hi> retyred to the Lord <hi>Campoyſe,</hi> who had ſeazed on ſome houſes right againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Abbey Saint <hi>Maure,</hi> and had made a <hi>baricado</hi> vpon the banke. In the meane time they ſent the Lord <hi>Cheſue</hi> to the Prince, who cauſed the Prince to paſſe his army backe ouer <hi>Lotion,</hi> to make a ready reſolution to paſſe in fighting, or elſe to take his way at aduenture ouer the countrey of <hi>Beauſe.</hi> For if he ſhould make any delay, without doubt hee ſhould be diſcomfited, hauing the enemy within a litle league both aboue and beneath, who reen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced themſelues euery howre, and that there were other armed Boats diſcouered, which followed the former. Therefore to take readily aduiſe,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:8966:39"/>
and to informe them thereof, and that if neede be the Lord <hi>Laual</hi> might repaſſe to them although not without danger.</p>
               <p>The Prince vnderſtanding theſe newes, aſſembled all the heads and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1585. October"/> Captaynes in the wood, which is on the banke of <hi>Lorion,</hi> nigh the place of the paſſage: where they reaſoned more then two howres, what was expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to be done in this extremity. Some gaue counſell to take their way toward <hi>Beauſe,</hi> and to get to the <hi>Loyre</hi> aboue <hi>Orleans,</hi> for that they had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſufficient ynough to paſſe all hazardes, and to fight if neede were.</p>
               <p>Others were agaynſt that, and alleaged, that the army was weake by paſſing ouer of the forces of the Lords <hi>Laual,</hi> and <hi>Burlay,</hi> and therefore did aduiſe to deſcend into <hi>Britayne,</hi> where ſhips might bee had out of <hi>Rochel,</hi> &amp; ſo it were eaſy to paſſe beneath <hi>Nantes:</hi> and by theſe meanes to ſaue their men with the loſſe of their horſes.</p>
               <p>In this diuerſity of opinions they could conclude nothing: but ſeeing the night approched, they returned to <hi>Beaufort,</hi> their to take reſolution of their affayres.</p>
               <p>There was a Noble man, one Lord <hi>D'ouault,</hi> an old warrier, who not long afore the paſſage ouer <hi>Loyre,</hi> put him ſelf willingly in the company of the Lord <hi>Laual.</hi> This Noble man vnderſtanding that the Prince could not repaſſe, and that he was determined to take his way ouer the countrey of <hi>Beauſe,</hi> which could not bee done without great hazard, did Ieaue the Lord <hi>Laual</hi> his company (who was about to retyre from the banke of <hi>Loyre</hi> to <hi>Poytow)</hi> &amp; did venture to repaſſe <hi>Loyre,</hi> notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding the great danger, proteſting that he would die with the Prince if occaſion ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it: and ſo with great danger repaſſing the riuer, ouertooke the Prince at <hi>Beaufort.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The reſolution to repaſſe the <hi>Lorion,</hi> cauſed the Prince and the Lordes who were with him to reſolue themſelues agaynſt whom ſo euer. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding euery one did looke vpon his fellow, as commonly is done in ſuch ineuitable dangers, where is ſeene no remedy. Some ſayd, <hi>ſaltem olim ſi meminiſſe iuuaret:</hi> others ſayd, <hi>vnaſalus victis nullam ſperare ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem.</hi> Few thought, that theſe blowes came from Heauen for the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their vices: and ſpecially for ſwearing and blaſpheming, which were not puniſhed in that armie, where were many of the League, who induced others to their wickednes and licentious life.</p>
               <p>All that day there was a great diſorder for them that had paſſed to repaſſe agayne ouer <hi>Lorion,</hi> hauing but one boate which could not receaue aboue ten horſes at once, and that cauſed the diſorder, for that euery one would bee firſt and no man laſt.</p>
               <p>This was to bee noted in the Prince, that he chaunged not his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, but as hee did at the paſſage of <hi>Loyre:</hi> ſo now he anſwered to them y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> repreſented him the danger, ſaying, we will fight. And becauſe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:8966:40"/>
encreaſed at the paſſage of <hi>Lorion,</hi> ſending ſufficient number of horſemen to euery place, where the enemy might come vppon them, hee lyghted of his horſe, and cauſed men, horſes, and cariage to paſſe: and when <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1585. October"/> it was more then one hower in the night hee paſſed himſelfe: notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding many remayned all night in the marſhes, who paſſed the next day following in the morning.</p>
               <p>The night following the 25. day of October, it was concluded by the Prince &amp; Nobles with him, to take ouer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> countrey, which lyeth betwene the <hi>Lorion,</hi> and <hi>Loiz,</hi> which is a Riuer comming from <hi>Vendoſme</hi> to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,</hi> to the end to recouer <hi>Beauſe,</hi> and ſo to paſſe <hi>Loyre</hi> at <hi>Bogeancye, Bloys,</hi> or <hi>Sancerre:</hi> or if the worſt came, with long iourneyes to attayne to the head of <hi>Loyre,</hi> with reſolution to fight agaynſt whomſoeuer.</p>
               <p>All that night there was hot ſkirmiſhing betweene them that came down from <hi>Samur</hi> in the boats, and the garriſon, which the Prince had left at the Abbay of Saynt <hi>Maure,</hi> vnder Captayne <hi>Serpant,</hi> where was alſo the Lord <hi>Laual</hi> and <hi>Boulay,</hi> who as is afore ſayd, had repaſſed the <hi>Loyre.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Auantigny,</hi> who remayned all that night in the houſe called <hi>Menetriere,</hi> not farre from the banke of <hi>Loyre</hi> to make the retyre, paſſed the <hi>Lorion,</hi> with all the reſidue very early, &amp; arryued at <hi>Beaufort</hi> with the Prince about eight a clocke in the morning, the 26. and the ſame day was the paſſage of Saint <hi>Mathurine</hi> beneath Saynt <hi>Maure,</hi> ſtopped with boats, furniſhed with ordinance and garriſon.</p>
               <p>The 26. the Lords <hi>Laual</hi> and <hi>Boulay,</hi> with the garriſon which was at Saint <hi>Maur,</hi> vnderſtanding that the Prince was returned beyond <hi>Lorion,</hi> with determination to croſſe ouer the countrey of <hi>Beauſe,</hi> and that the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of Saynt <hi>Mathurine</hi> was ſtopped, thought neceſſarye to retyre into <hi>Xainctonge,</hi> with all diligence, and with ſuch forces as they had, to oppoſe themſelues againſt the attemptes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> enemies which might ryſe there, to aſſemble the nobility and other ſouldiers which were left there, &amp; alſo to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the troupes which were left at the ſiege of <hi>Browage,</hi> and to make the places ſure in <hi>Poytow</hi> and <hi>Xainctonge:</hi> and in very deede, God did worke al the ſayd euentes, by their preſence there.</p>
               <p>The King aduertiſed what was paſſed at <hi>Angers,</hi> putteth foorth his forces out of all partes, to ſet vpon the Prince.</p>
               <p>It is ſayd before, how the King intended to make ciuill warre in <hi>Guy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enne,</hi> &amp; firſt of all to beginne in <hi>Poitow</hi> &amp; <hi>Xainctonge,</hi> as being next neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to him of all the Prouinces which do profeſſe the Gaſpell: for the which cauſe he had ordayned aforehand prouiſions of corue, and wine to be ſet vp in certayne townes and cities: &amp; among others the Duke <hi>de Mayne</hi> was appoynted, to that warre, not as one who was thought fit for that charge, but for the cauſes which do follow.</p>
               <p>As the <hi>Guyzes,</hi> to wit, the Dukes, <hi>Guyze, Mame</hi> &amp; Cardinal, bretheren &amp;
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:8966:40"/>
                  <hi>Aumale</hi> coſin vnto them, did conſent in theſe three points, to wit in alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the ſtate by tranſporting the crowne from the true owners, and haires into their familie, in killing, degrading, or at leaſt diſinheriting the houſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1585. October"/> of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> and deſtroying the auncient nobilitie whom they knew, would reſiſt their atempts, and beare vnpacientlie their vſurped tiranny. The Prieſts were the fire brands to kindle this ambitious rage, and by their money to aduaunce the ſame.</p>
               <p>So they all did prouide to bring this treaſon to effect, that of all things the kings forces ſhould not fall into any other hands then in to their own, or of their partakers: but ſpecially that none of the Princes of the bloud ſhould by any meanes be armed with the guiding of the Kings power. Wee ſee then how they all did agree, to vndoe the King with his owne forces.</p>
               <p>But herein they did vary, for euery one had particular fetches and drifts, which did ſwim in their braynes, whereby they went about to aduaunce their particular affaires, by the Kings forces: for the Duke of <hi>Guize</hi> did determine to ſtay nigh the Kings perſon, and not to goe farre from <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Belgike,</hi> where he had gotten great fauours and many partakers, there expecting either fit oportunitie to ſtrike the blowe which he had long afore hand purpoſed, or elſe at the leaſt, hee bearing the ſway about the Kinges perſon and counſell, might both ſpy and preuent the Kings driftes and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie, if he ſhould ſeeme to wauer neuer ſo little, and keepe of the Princes of the bloud and Nobilitie, from entring into fauour with the King, whereby they might diſapoint his driftes.</p>
               <p>He alſo imagined, that whatſoeuer might happen, <hi>Paris</hi> and the <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gike</hi> being at his deuotion, either were able to defend him againſtthe Kings attempts, or elſe if the King might be cut off by any miſfortune, the ſaide citie and countrey would be able to lift him vp into that roome, whereon he did ſo greatly deſire to ſit; euen againſt the conſent of the reſt of the realme, and againſt his owne brother the Duke <hi>De Maine,</hi> whoſe emulation hee not onely alwaies ſuſpected and deſired to preuent, but alſo endeuored to ſend him farre from the ſaid King, citie and countrey: beſide that, he knew to be a fit inſtrument, by ſkilfull entiſing and policie to ſeduce their great and populous cities of <hi>Poytiers, Limoges, Perigueux, Bourdeaulx,</hi> &amp; others where he ſhould come, regarding not at whoſe deuotion thoſe cities might bee, ſo that they were not in the power and fidelitie of the King, or of the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> that by ſo much they might be weakened.</p>
               <p>The Duke <hi>De Mayne</hi> being appointed for <hi>Guienne,</hi> not to ſubdue it, but to haue the Kings forces, in the hands and at the deuotion of the League, and farre from him, if at a pinch he ſhould haue neede of them, was very vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to depart from <hi>Paris</hi> to his iourney: aleaging alwaies ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe. The cauſes of his vnwillingnes were loue, ambition, and feare, the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:8966:41"/>
obiects of theſe affections were Maſters Saint <hi>Beuſue,</hi> and other Courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſans in the towne of <hi>Paris,</hi> where he walowed himſelfe in filthie pleaſures <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1585. October"/> and whoredome, as the Boare in the myre: his owne brother whome hee would haue preuented, what occaſion might haue happened by keeping <hi>Paris</hi> ouer his head: for he was acquainted with the intents and driftes of the League, as one of the chiefeſt of them yet vncertaine of the euents, and what in his abſence being ſo farre from <hi>Paris,</hi> might happen vnto the King: he would faine haue kept <hi>Paris</hi> ſtill in poſſeſſion, ſo that if either nature or violence ſhould bereaue the King of his life, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e might haue that capitall, mightie, rich, and factious citie in his owne poſſeſſion, by whoſe helpe hee ſuppoſed to ataine to his long wiſhed deſires, and become his eldeſt bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers maſter.</p>
               <p>The third cauſe was feare, and the obiect thereof, the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> for knowing that the ſaid King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> was priuie to their driftes, not onely by his deepe and princelike prudencie, many euident tokens: and their own too manifeſt attempts, but ſpeciallie by their inticing him, and them of the reformed Religion, to their conſpiracie and faction, knowing him alſo to be a Prince moſt faithfull to the ſtate, Crowne and Realme of <hi>France,</hi> a Prince of great valour, and implacable to traitors: thus hauing a conſcience (which is more then a thouſand witneſſes guiltie) feare made him continually to enter into ſuch apprehenſions, that he thought certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to goe into <hi>Guienne,</hi> was to goe to a moſt aſſured death.</p>
               <p>Thus theſe two bretheren aſpiring both to the crowne, yet did varie in thoughts, as the auncient ſaying is, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. For the Duke <hi>De Mayne</hi> would faine to keepe the poſſeſſion of <hi>Paris,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore maketh many excuſes, hauing not ſometime money enough, another time hauing to weake forces, ſometime aleaging health, ſometime the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable weather. The Duke of <hi>Guize</hi> was greatly deſirous to haue him out of <hi>Paris,</hi> ſuppoſing that there his ſhadowe did infect the citie: and therefore to take away all excuſe, leaſt he ſhould aleage his forces, not to be ſufficient to march with the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> he cauſed the King to adde vnto him the regiments of Swiſſers. So the Duke <hi>De Mayne</hi> hauing eight thouſand Swiſſers, twelue regiment of French footemen, twelue hundred horſemen French: Forces ſufficient for a good Captaine to ſubdue the whole countrey, receaued eight and twentie thouſand Crownes, which the treaſorer of the Cleargie deliuered him: and ſhortlie after eyght and twentie thouſand more, and not long after his departing ſent him foure and fiftie thouſand more. Yet the King could by no meanes perſwade him to take his iourney (for the Kings commaundements he regarded not) vntill the newes came to the King, that the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> had paſſed <hi>Loyre</hi> out of <hi>Poytow</hi> into <hi>Anjou,</hi> ſo that at length with great importunacie, being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded by his brother, that in the abſence of the Prince (being as if it were
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:8966:41"/>
incloſed in) he might eaſily ſubdue all that countrey, and that it was neede with his armie all by one voyage to goe to the other ſide of <hi>Loyre,</hi> to let the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1585. October"/> repaſſing of the Prince, if he ſhould atempt it, about the 23. of October, weeping and wayling as a child, he went out of <hi>Paris,</hi> aſſured of ſtripes, if he ſhould come within the reach of the ſaid King of <hi>Nauarre.</hi> And wher, as at his departing, he had opened his timerouſnes to euiuently, he thought good to couer it with the cloake of vanitie for want of a better, in breathing bloud, ſlaughter, and fire, in words and bragges: which at length were tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into a blaſt of colde winde, yet fully reſolued not to come within the reach of the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> for feare of the Baſtonado, or Strapado, or ſome ſuch like thing: being in good hope in the meane time, that in walking and taking his pleaſures in <hi>Guyenne</hi> at the Prieſtes coſts, he might make his part ſtrong with ſeducing the forenamed Cities and other, from the Kings obedience, to his deuotion: but he was as far deceaued in that, as in eſcaping the Baſtonado.</p>
               <p>But now to returne to our purpoſe, the Duke <hi>Ioyeuſe</hi> was at the back of the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> the Duke <hi>De Mayne</hi> paſſing through <hi>Orleans,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the riuer of <hi>Loyre</hi> was at his right hand, and as farre as <hi>Bloyſe,</hi> ſtopped all the paſſages, leaſt the ſaide Prince might paſſe ouer. The King had ſent <hi>Biron</hi> with forces into <hi>Beauſe,</hi> which marched right againſt his face, leaſt hee ſhould eſcape that way, on the left hand the way to the ſea through <hi>Britaine</hi> and <hi>Normandie,</hi> was long difficulte and dangerous, by reaſon of many townes and Gariſons therein placed.</p>
               <p>The Prince being thus compaſſed about with al theſe forces of enemies was in leſſe daunger, becauſe that they knew not what, and how things paſſed in his armie, and ſuppoſing the ſame to be farre cloſer and ſtronger then it was in deede, did greatlie feare to aboard it: whereby he and all his Captaines had opportunitie to beguile them, and to ſteale away from them.</p>
               <p>Now, to knowe well the reſt of this voyage, vntill the diſſolution of the armie, it is neceſſarie to know the ſituation of the country. There is on the north ſide of <hi>Lorion,</hi> a riuer called <hi>Loire,</hi> waſhing the townes of <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteau dune, Vendoſme, Chasteaudeloy, Lude, Fleſche,</hi> and <hi>Luche,</hi> which mée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with the riuer <hi>Sartre</hi> at <hi>Angers,</hi> falleth into <hi>Loyre,</hi> beneath <hi>Pont de ſel.</hi> The Prince at his departing from <hi>Beaufort,</hi> folowed this riuer almoſt as far as <hi>Chasteau dune.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The 26. of October, the Princes armie diſlodged from <hi>Beaufort,</hi> inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to lodge at the towne of <hi>Luche</hi> in <hi>Anjou,</hi> belonging to the Lord <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong,</hi> there purpoſing to paſſe ouer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſayd <hi>Loyre</hi> vpon the bridge, into the countrey which lyeth betweene the ſayd riuer <hi>Loyre</hi> and <hi>Sartre,</hi> called <hi>Vau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deloyre:</hi> but the riuer was ſo ouerflowen, (as though the foure Elements had ſet themſelues agaynſt that army) that it did couer halfe of the ſayd
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:8966:42"/>
bridge: and the Lord <hi>Clermont</hi> (which is Lord of the place) ſounding the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1585. October"/> foord himſelfe, thought it were not paſſable: whereupon they determined that day to goe to <hi>Lude.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There happened vnto them other things which increaſed greatly the amaze. For newes came that the Duke <hi>Ioyeuſe,</hi> with greater forces than theirs, purſued with great haſt after them, and that not long after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting of the Prince, he had ſeazed vpon <hi>Beaufort.</hi> On the other ſide, the countrey (which before trembled for feare of them) began to riſe vpon them: for they of the <hi>Fleſche</hi> the ſelfeſame day iſſued out, and intercepted ſome ſouldiers and carriage. That day according to the determination they lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged at <hi>Lude.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The 27. of October they would haue paſſed ouer <hi>Loyre</hi> vpon the bridge of <hi>Lude,</hi> but it was ſo highly ouerflowen, that although it was eaſie to paſſe the bridge, yet at the further ſide of the ſaid bridge there was another great riuer, which they muſt néedes paſſe ouer by a foord, for there was but a little boate which would ſcarſe carrie three men without daunger. The horſemen paſſed and ſet themſelues in battell aray, vntill all had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: there a great many gaue ouer their carriage, &amp; they which had friends in the countrey gaue them their ſtuffe. That day from <hi>Lude</hi> they ſent the Lords <hi>Boyſduly,</hi> and <hi>Aubiguy,</hi> towards <hi>Boyſgency, Mere,</hi> and S. <hi>Die,</hi> to finde ſome paſſage, and that the morrowe after they ſhould all méete at <hi>Orges,</hi> or the Chappell S. <hi>Martine.</hi> Whileſt they ſtayed in that playne in battell aray, for the ſafe paſſage of all the companies, there happened a thing which would haue wrapped a ſuperſtitious ſoule into ſundrie and fearefull thoughts: for not farre thence beyond them was a Hare ſtarted by the enemies, betwéene the <hi>Loyre</hi> and <hi>Lotion,</hi> with a great crye after, which gaue them the alarum, and all prepared themſelues to receaue the enemie couragiouſly: but at length the Hare was ſeene with more than two hundred horſes with fewe dogges. That poore Hare paſſed and repaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed among the horſes feete with many ſtripes, and yet was not taken, but ſaued her ſelf though ſhe was purſued more than halfe a mile. Some tooke this for an euill, and ſome a good preſage; ſaying, that if God had care to preſerue that poore feeble and fearefull beaſt, much more would hee haue care of that little flocke amazed: which howſoeuer it was hollowed and purſued by all the forces of <hi>France,</hi> notwithſtanding would eſcape ſafe and ſound, in receiuing but feare without great hurt: which thing alſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Lude</hi> they at length arriued at <hi>Prillay</hi> two houres in the night: this is a great towne belonging to the Prince <hi>County,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> his yonger brother. At their comming thither, there was ſuch a confuſion and preſſe in the ſtreates, that they could neither goe forward nor back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for the ſpace of an houre, not the Prince himſelf, vntil that the doores
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:8966:42"/>
of ſome houſes broaken gaue ſome roome.</p>
               <p>The 29. day they marched through <hi>Vandeloyre,</hi> and at night came to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1585. October"/> S. <hi>Arnol,</hi> and the villages about not farre from <hi>Lauerdine,</hi> but the ſayd S. <hi>Arnol</hi> was a poore little village, where was ſmall ſtore of lodgings; ſo that the further they went, the néerer they approached to their miſeries. There alſo newes came that the enemies followed after them as coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly and with ſuch haſt, as they went about to goe from them with great iourneys. The Lords <hi>Eſpernon</hi> and <hi>Byron,</hi> and moſt of the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Court, were at <hi>Bonaual</hi> in <hi>Beauſe</hi> to méete with this terrified ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie. The Duke <hi>de Mayn</hi> on the other ſide with a great armie, was on the other ſide of the riuer of <hi>Loyre</hi> neere <hi>Bloys,</hi> to cut them off by the way, if by chaunce they ſhould repaſſe. The Townes betwéene <hi>Bloys</hi> and <hi>Orleans</hi> were all be ſet with ſtrong garriſons. The Lord <hi>Chaſtre</hi> had ſent into <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loigne</hi> to kéepe the riuer of <hi>Loyre,</hi> and to retire the boates and milles into the townes. The Commons were ſet to watch, readie to riſe vpon them at the firſt ſound of the Toxine.</p>
               <p>The companies of the Prince were as wearie, as their enemies were luſtie, and as men may bee wearie with courſes and watches, ſo horſes much more with galloping night and day without reſting. The meanes to paſſe betweene <hi>Bloys</hi> and <hi>Amboyſe</hi> fayled them: all theſe things being knowne of all, made them to haue little hope of their affayres. Yet there is no doubt that if the enemie had appeared, the neceſſitie had much increaſed their courage. But it ſeemed that by a ſingular prouidence of God, the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies ſtood in ſuch feare of theſe companies, that he would haue them defeated through wearines, that it might appeare to be Gods owne hand, and his proper work to ſcatter them, and that his enemies ſhould not haue the praiſe, nor triumph ouer them. For afterward it was confeſſed by the enemies which were in the armie of <hi>Ioyeuſe</hi> and the League, that this handfull of men, wearied, ſcattered, amazed, and alreadie ouercome, was to all thoſe troopes (who would haue ſwallowed them vp) ſuch a terrour, that if they had offered to ſet vpon them, they might happely haue found them eaſie to bee dealt withall. For the enemies were perſwaded that the Prince would neuer haue enterprized ſuch a iourney, vnleſſe he had béen able to beate downe all that had come before him.</p>
               <p>All that night in the which they lodged at S. <hi>Arnol,</hi> there was great reaſoning among them of the Counſell, what was expedient to bee done. The Lord <hi>Rohan</hi> (with many Gentlemen of his company) ſayd, that the further they ſhould goe that way, the déeper they ſhould ſinke in daunger; that the beſt part of their forces had paſſed ouer <hi>Loyre</hi> with the Lord <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual,</hi> and that the armie did ſlide away daily: they that had friends in <hi>Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domoys, Beauſe, Mayne</hi> &amp; <hi>Perche,</hi> did ſteale away; the enemie being freſh and ſtrong did approach on them on euery ſide; and that the further they
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:8966:43"/>
went vpward, the néerer they did drawe to their miſfortune. Let him carrie his head to <hi>Paris</hi> who would (ſaid he) for I will carrie mine into <hi>Britaine,</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1585. October"/> and fight with him that will let me. So vppon theſe ſpéeches (ſeeing not the contrary reaſons of any force) tooke his leaue from the Prince, &amp; his ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney toward <hi>Britaine,</hi> whether he came through many difficulties and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and in time (notwithſtanding the endeuour of the Duke <hi>Mercure)</hi> with ſafetie he paſſed the riuer of <hi>Loyre</hi> beneath <hi>Nants,</hi> and repayred to <hi>Rochel,</hi> with great ioy and contentation of all men for his ſafe returne.</p>
               <p>This ſeparation was as a ſecond thunderboult from heauen vpon this armie, which is no more to bee called an armie, but a ſmall companie: for there was no more but the companies of the Prince, and of the Lord <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouille,</hi> whereof ſome had forſaken him, There were alſo left ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of the Harquebuſiers on horſeback of the Lord <hi>Clermont,</hi> of whom many had alreadie retired to their houſes: then they began to looke euery one vppon his fellowe, ſhrugging with their ſhoulders, euery one did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that if there were any ſafetie, it muſt miraculouſly come from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and many which before in matters of prayer and conſcience had giuen themſelues to great licentiouſnes, began to enter into conſideration, and to reforme themſelues.</p>
               <p>The Prince remayning ſo with theſe few companyes, had a number of carryage, wherewith he was ſo hampered that he could not rid himſelfe of it. He ſent the Lord Saint <hi>Gelays,</hi> with ſome gentlemen of <hi>Poytow,</hi> to the number of 30. horſes to ryde toward <hi>Vendoſme,</hi> and ſome where to take lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginges commodious for the companies which followed. But in the way they heard newes, that the Lord <hi>Lauerdine</hi> with ſome number of men had entred into <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>endoſme,</hi> to cut that way from the Prince: and that the night before ſome Souldiers of the company of the Lord <hi>Clermont</hi> tooke pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonners ſome of the company of the Lord <hi>Benhare</hi> gouernor of <hi>Vendoſme,</hi> who brought ſome ſtore of armor to theyr maſter.</p>
               <p>The 30. of October, the reſt of the companies arryued at Saint <hi>Anne,</hi> nigh <hi>Vendoſme,</hi> where they thought to haue departed logings, but for the pouerty of the place they ſtayed not there.</p>
               <p>In this wandering through the countrey of <hi>Beauſe,</hi> ſome of the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Captayne <hi>Bonet,</hi> tooke the Lord <hi>Roſins,</hi> who comming from <hi>Paris</hi> with a Paſport from the King (which he ſhewed them, not ſuppoſing they had béen of the religion) was going to the King of <hi>Nauarre.</hi> This Lord had foure notable great horſes. The Dragons (for ſo were called the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuziers on horſebacke) weary of their tyred horſes, chaunged with the great horſes of the fayd Lord <hi>Roſins,</hi> and with great ioy carryed him away with them. But he being knowen by the Lord Saint <hi>Gelays,</hi> hee cauſed them to reſtore him his horſes, and to take their tyred horſes agayne.</p>
               <p>The ſayd Lord <hi>Roſins,</hi> was conducted to the Prince, and ſhewed him the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:8966:43"/>
rage wherewith his enemies prepared themſelues to compaſſe him about: and beſides, hee told him many thinges ſufficient to make him take ſome <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1585. Octob."/> reſolution.</p>
               <p>But it was nothing to the aduertiſements ſent him from diuers places, as that he was incloſed on euery ſide, and that ſhortly he ſhould haue the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy to come vpon him with forces farre vnequall to his: and that it was high time to handle his affayres wiſely without delaying, till to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>morrow.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, he was aduertyzed that the meanes to repaſſe <hi>Loyre</hi> toward <hi>Bloys,</hi> were cut off, by reaſon that the enemies nigh at hand had preuented it. The Prince arryuing at the towne of <hi>Salowme,</hi> a league beyond Saynt <hi>Anne,</hi> gathered his counſell, and all reaſons wayghed on e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery ſide, he was earneſtly requeſted by all them that were preſent, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for the ſafety of his perſon: the which being conducted in a ſafe place, the reſt by Gods helpe would in time find out ſome way of deliuerance.</p>
               <p>The reaſons whereby hee was perſwaded to take ſome reſolution, were theſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that his retire would be more honorable to him, and more ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the enemy, then to hazard (as if it were through diſpayre) vpon a bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, whereof the iſſue could not bee but very perilous both to his perſon, &amp; to the whole eſtate of the reformed religion.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that in ſuch extremity and diſfauour, there was gotten ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor ynough, by a ſingular grace of God, to haue auoyded the rage of ſo great forces of his enemies, who did hold him as if hee were encloſed and compaſſed round about: and to ſnatch from them the glory which they had promiſed to themſelues already of his death, before that euer they durſt looke him in the face: and that the valoure of noble courage was ſhewed as well in auoyding an euident danger, as in the exploits of battell.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that the paſſages were not ſo cloſed vp, but that there was meanes to eſcape to ſome ſafe place. It was hard to make him condiſcend to theſe reaſons, yet at length conuicted by the way of intreaty and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, hee concluded to retire.</p>
               <p>But afore he would depart, that night with his conſtancye accuſtomed, hee tooke order for the parting of his companies, euen of his owne houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold. The Lord Saynt <hi>Gelayes</hi> with ſome of the companies, and part of his Gards ſhould goe toward <hi>Loyre,</hi> to ioyne with the Lords <hi>Aubiguy,</hi> and <hi>Briſduly,</hi> who were gone to ſearch paſſage towardes <hi>Loyre:</hi> and ſuch of his houſhould ſeruantes as would not, or could not follow the Lord Saynt <hi>Gelays,</hi> he directed them to retyre to ſome friendes of his in the countrey. Furthermore, that the Lord <hi>Clermont</hi> ſhould retyre ſome where with his companies. This being done, about 11. of the clocke at night he departed with a ſmal company, with the Lords <hi>Trimouille,</hi> and
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:8966:44"/>
Auantigny, and other gentlemen with few of his chiefeſt houſhold ſeruants. The waies which he tooke, the courſes which he ranne, the dangers which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1585. October"/> hee paſſed through to get to the Ilandes of <hi>Gernſey,</hi> lying in the narrow Seas betweene <hi>England</hi> &amp; <hi>France,</hi> what courteſies and Princelike inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynment he receaued of that great <hi>Elizabeth</hi> Queene of <hi>England,</hi> &amp; how with a great number of Nobility and ſhips of war he returned to <hi>Rochel:</hi> alſo with great reioycing of all men he was receaued by them of <hi>Rochell,</hi> is the argument of an other booke, which the tyme ſhall produce.</p>
               <p>But here be three thinges worthy to be noted. Firſt, how God doth lay heauy croſſes vpon his children, and do compaſſe them with ineuitable dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers (after mans wiſedom) both to make them ſee with the eye how weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man is ſtayed, which truſteth in the arme of fleſh, and worldly power.</p>

               <p>That night therefore, about twelue a clock, one houre after the depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Prince, with the gardes of the ſaid Prince, who were about threeſhore Harquebuſiers, he tooke his way to <hi>Vilelniſant,</hi> where the reſt of the companies were lodged, to take their iourney to the Chapell Saint <hi>Martin,</hi> and from thence diſlodging together, came to the ſaide Chapel one houre afore day. There were about 500. horſes of all ſorts, but not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue 200. fit to fight, and yet of them, who might haue fought, many ſhould haue been faine to fight on foote, for their horſes were readie to fall vpon their noſes, and the men but a little more worth.</p>
               <p>The 31. of October, they ariued at the Chapell Saint <hi>Martin</hi> verie ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilie, and becauſe they needed to baite their horſes, and refreſh themſelues, the inhabitants ſaw their doores broken afore they were called vp.

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:8966:45"/>
an vnpoſſible thing to paſſe <hi>Loyre</hi> that way: the Lord Saint <hi>Gelays</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted with the Lorde <hi>Tiffardiere</hi> and others, who concluded to goe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1585.

               <p>There was in the Caſtell of <hi>Orges,</hi> an olde Gentleman Papiſt, who hearing that the Lord Saint <hi>Gelaies</hi> was in that companie, deſired to ſee him, and to ſpeake with him, and knowing that his companie was wearie and weake, and weather beaten, aſked him whether he went, and what he meant to doo with his companie, and ſwearing with a great oath, told him that hee was vndone, and that if hee had three times as many men as hee had, within an houre (if he ſoiorned there) he and his would bee cut in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p>This Gentleman was very ſtout, becauſe of the Kings &amp; the Leaguers forces, which hee knew to bee thereabout: hee ſhewed him that there was great companies, as well on the ſide of the riuer, as on the ſide of <hi>Beauſe,</hi> not diſtant from him aboue halfe a League nigh the Forreſt of <hi>Marche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyre,</hi> with this intent to charge that remnant of the armie, which was with him: how all the commons had the watch word, and looked to haue ſome warning to begin. There was no hope to eſcape being few (and they wearie and weatherbeaten) without any hope of ſuccour.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Boyſduly</hi> met nigh <hi>Talſy</hi> two Gentlemen papiſts of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, who ſhewed him the ſelfeſame daungers aboueſayd: and yet more, that neither hee, neither they who were with him were farre from ſpoyle. The Lord <hi>Boyſduly</hi> perceiuing, that a Gentleman called <hi>la Mot,</hi> (in whom he had much confidence) knew very well the amaze of that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie, after aſſurance of amitie for himſelfe, and the Lord S. <hi>Gelays,</hi> hée certified them that they were in a worſer caſe than they knew: and that the Prince perceiuing that hee had ſo great forces agaynſt him, had diſſolued his armie, and that his perſon was alreadie in place of ſafetie, and almoſt all his armie: and that there remayned no more but that which hee ſawe with the Lord Saint <hi>Gelays,</hi> who at all aduenture had vndertaken to ſaue the reſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>La Mot</hi> then offered him friendſhip, &amp; his houſes for to retire with ſuch of his friends as hee would, but his houſe was diſtant from thence eight leagues: which his courteſie the Lord <hi>Boyſduly</hi> accepted.</p>
               <p>In theſe terrors, all the troupe (being on horſebacke) marched at large in a plaine field, not farre from the Caſtle <hi>Orges</hi> of one ſide, and neere the Forreſt of <hi>Marchenoire</hi> on the other ſide: no man knewe which way to turne himſelfe too, nor what to followe; for a preſent daunger was on eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſide. The Lord S. <hi>Gelays,</hi> and other Captaynes with him, were long before they could conclude of their way. The enemies did approach and held that ſmall companie in ſight: of which being aduertized, they marched

within the Forreſt of <hi>Marchenoire:</hi> and being ſomewhat entered within the ſayd Forreſt, in the high way to <hi>Chasteaudune,</hi> the Lord S. <hi>Gelays</hi> ſhewed them the ineuitable danger whereunto they were fallen: he ſhewed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1585.

               <p>The Lords S. <hi>Gelays, Boyſduly, Campoys, Cheſmi,</hi> and others, to the number of ten or twelue, went vnder the aſſurance of the Lord <hi>Mot,</hi> the way to <hi>Chasteaudune</hi> in <hi>Beauſſe.</hi> As it was a ſtraunge thing to ſee the diſſipation of that armie without blowes, bloudſhed, or loſſe of any man by the fight of the enemie: ſo it was a pitifull ſight to ſee the ſeparation of the Souldiers from their Captaines; of the ſeruants from their maſters: the ſeruants did caſt away the things which they had gréedily gathered, to ſaue themſelues vppon their horſes. The waies were full of good ſtuffe, armes, baſkets, males, apparell, and other things of value: euery one did caſt away the things which they had taken from others more willingly, than when they tooke it. God did then require an accompt of many diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered perſons, in whoſe hands Manna did rot, which they had greedily gathered: And it is to be confeſſed, that God teſtified from heauen, that he will haue his worke aduanced by other meanes than by ſuch armes: for a great companie of this armie were not accompanied with pietie and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian modeſtie. On the other ſide, God tooke away all matter of boaſting and glorying from the enemies: for it was a ſtraunge thing, that conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the ſmall diſtance of places, where theſe companies of the enemie were, the great multitude of luſtie, freſh, and well furniſhed companies which they had, the Countreys and Townes thrée or foure ſcore leagues round about all fauourable to them, hauing compaſſed the others round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, yet not one after this ſeparation appeared to fight, nor to aſſault theſe vanquiſhed few men, as he which durſt not come nigh the ſkinne of a dead Lyon.</p>
               <p>The Lord Saint <hi>Gelays,</hi> with them of his companie, had ſcarſe gone a League in <hi>Beauſe,</hi> when he diſcouered three cornets of Launcers of Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and Albanoyces, who were from <hi>Chasteaudune</hi> marched in good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and came trotting forward at the end of the Forreſt, where the ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was made. The Lord <hi>Mot</hi> (who lead the Lord Saint <hi>Gelais</hi> and his companie) did feare, and felt himſelfe in great daunger (as he ſaide) with

               <p>The Lord S. <hi>Gelays</hi> and his companie, beléeued certainly that thoſe troupes came vpon them, and thought themſelues as good as dead. But behold, the eyes of theſe armed men were ſo blinded by the power of him which blinded <hi>Bilham</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Beor,</hi> and <hi>Elimas</hi> the Sorcerer, that without perceiuing him, or any of his companie, they paſſed by within the diſtance of fiftie paces from them: there was onely a barne of a Farme betwixt them, and the Lord S. <hi>Gelays</hi> ſtood ſtill in the high way before the barne. It was a wonder that this companie was ſo carried away inuiſible out of ſight of that multitude, as if it were in a clowde: and that none of the enemies went through the high way, whereby they might haue béen diſcouered. Theſe companies of Italians and Albaneſes went into a vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage not farre of, where they perceiued ſome horſes and Harquebuſiers: they ſet vpon the houſe where the Lord <hi>Aubigny</hi> was, with others, who neuertheleſſe tooke their horſes &amp; ſaued themſelues without any domage. Theſe horſemen found much ſpoile by the way without any man to claime it. The Lord S. <hi>Gelays</hi> riding along in the champiane countrie of <hi>Beauſſe</hi> toward <hi>Chartres,</hi> with the Lord <hi>Mot,</hi> without kéeping any high way, the night being rainie and darke, began to enter in ſuſpition of the ſayd <hi>Mot,</hi> being a Papiſt. So the Lord <hi>Mot</hi> returned backe with this opinion, that the Lord S. <hi>Gelays</hi> with his companie, would goe to <hi>Cheuroles</hi> toward <hi>Orleans:</hi> but he tooke his iourney to <hi>Ianuile</hi> lying betwéene <hi>Chartres</hi> and <hi>Orleans:</hi> and there croſſing the high way from <hi>Paris</hi> to <hi>Orleans,</hi> paſſed through many companies of armed men, who were lodged in <hi>Beauſſe,</hi> and ſo recouered vpon him the Forreſt of <hi>Orleans<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               </p>
               <p>The returning backe of the Lord <hi>Mot</hi> (as is aboue ſayd) was to play a popiſh tricke with the Lord Saint <hi>Gelays:</hi> for perceiuing that he was not ſtrong enough, he went in the night to gather companie to haue ſet vppon them at <hi>Cheuroles,</hi> and ſo to haue taken them priſoners to his aduantage, as he did not diſſemble afterward to ſpeake openly. So that his profeſſing of amitie, was an allurement to drawe them into his ſnare: for afterward he followed them as farre as <hi>Ianuile</hi> with thirtie horſes in a companie.</p>
               <p>The firſt day of Nouember, with much payne all the day long ranging and galloping through the Forreſt, at length they got the banck of <hi>Loyre,</hi> not farre from the towne of <hi>Guyen,</hi> about midnight.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Mot</hi> for his paynes had many horſes, but ſpecially one, for the which was refuſed foure hundred Crownes. And ſeeing himſelfe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoynted of his intent, afterward he could not diſſemble to ſay, that he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped to haue had fiftéene thouſand Crownes of raunſome for the Lord S. <hi>Gelays</hi> onely, which was the cauſe (ſayd he) that he left the following of other <hi>Hugonets,</hi> whereby he might haue made himſelfe rich.</p>

The Lord <hi>Boyſduly</hi> was in hope to haue paſſed the riuer, by fauour of ſome friends which he had in that countrey: but hee was diſappoynted of his hope: which thing put them in diſpayre both of repaſſing, and of their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1585.

All the boates either were retired to the townes, or to the other ſide of the riuer, and the ſelfeſame day commandement was giuen to all Water-men and Fiſhers, vppon payne of death either to ſinke their boates, or to let them downe to <hi>Seuilly.</hi> The Lord <hi>Chaſtre</hi> (gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Berry)</hi> had commaunded to doo the like at <hi>Sancerre.</hi> The Prouoſt of <hi>Borbonnoys</hi> and <hi>Berry,</hi> with companies of Souldiers, did gallop along the riuer ſeeking ſome <hi>Hugonets</hi> ſtragling. The horſes of this ſmall number could go no more but a ſoft pace, and did fall downe for wearines: all things ſeemed contrary to them, ſo that in that diſpayre they determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to haue followed the way of <hi>Gien,</hi> or <hi>Briare,</hi> townes ſituated vpon the bankes of <hi>Loyre</hi> aboue <hi>Orleans,</hi> where doubtles they had béen all ſlaine or taken; for all was full of men of warre going downe the riuer to <hi>Orleans.</hi> But on a ſudden a little boye comming, conducted them to a towne called <hi>Omiroer,</hi> they went into an Iune where they ſayd they would baite, ſaying that they went toward the Lord <hi>Antragues,</hi> and that they purſued ſome <hi>Hugonets</hi> who had paſſed ouer the water. A peaſant vpon theſe words, (deſirous that they ſhould doo ſome good exployt that way) being there ſayd, There was yeſterday a litle boat beyond the water, which to morrow muſt goe downe to <hi>Seuilly:</hi> there it is yet, (this was about midnight) if it could be had you might paſſe quickly. They enquiring how to come by it, it was found very hard, the riuer was broade, the owner of the boate was in bed, the winde was great, and to call him were in vaine. But there was yeſterday (ſayd the peaſant) a quarter of a league off a boate mill, which draweth a little boate; if you could get that you might (ſaid he) two or thrée of you paſſe ouer to get the great boate. Without further delay they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooke the baite, the peaſant was their guide, the ſmall boate was at land, wherewith fewe paſſed to the mill, which was farre in the water. The Miller was ſurprized, who at the firſt reſiſted; for he ſhould bee hanged (ſayd he) if hee ayded them: at length hee paſſed ouer fiue of them in his ſmall boate, with their ſwords and piſtols in hand, thinking they ſhould be reſiſted: for it was ſayd that ſome Souldiers were on the other ſide to keepe the boate. They tooke the boate and the boatman, who withſtood them much; for it might coſt him his life (as he ſayd): notwithſtanding being enforced, he went to fetch the reſt of the companie which ſtayed on the other ſide. This paſſage ſo vnlooked for, reuiued both men and horſes, for neither of them were any more wearie: ſo that without any ſtaying, they rode two leagues ouerthwart the fields in <hi>Soleigne,</hi> where they found

a Farme, wherein they ſoiourned the reſt of that night.</p>
               <p>The 2. of Nouember they aduaunced toward <hi>Bourges,</hi> and ſeparated <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1585.

The Lorde Saint <hi>Gelais</hi> ſoiourned for a while in <hi>Berry,</hi> and after paſſing the riuers <hi>Creuſe, Vienne, Cher</hi> and <hi>Cline,</hi> ariued at Saint <hi>Ihan D' Angely,</hi> and <hi>Rochel,</hi> about the ſame time that the Prince returned out of <hi>England,</hi> where hee met the ſaid Prince, with the Lords <hi>Rohan, Clermont, Laual, Boulay,</hi> &amp; other No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and Captaines, without the loſſe of one man.

               <p>Secondly, heere is to bee conſidered, that the Lorde turned thoſe things (by the which they had prouoked God to anger) to their good.

               <p>Thirdly, how the Lord did delude the diſſimulation of the Lord <hi>la Mot,</hi> who vnder colour of amity, would haue ſnared them, either to the ſlaughter, or otherwiſe to their vndooing.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, how when they were cleane gone out of hope of their liues, and that it was time the Lord ſhould pull them out of the deepe mire with his owne hand, he ſendeth a boy, or rather an Angell, I meane a meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to direct them, where the meanes of their deliuerance ſhould be ſhewed vnto them.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all, the Lord did vſe the verie malice of the enemie, to wit, of the poyſon which he did beare to them of the religion, to be the meane and the guide how to paſſe the riuer, and to deliuer them out of ſo many ineuitable daungers, and intollerabe labours, to bring them to a place of ſafetie and reſt.</p>
               <p>This is alſo a marueilous thing, that the other Souldiours and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies ſcattered, as duſt blowne in the ayre, repaſſed the riuer <hi>Loyre,</hi> vpon the bridges of <hi>Orleans, Bloys, Amboyſe, Tours, Saumur,</hi> and others, euen with their armour, making any excuſe to ſerue their turne, as they would

               <p>The 25. of October, the Lord <hi>Boulay</hi> alſo and his companie paſſed at Saint <hi>Maturine</hi> beneath Saint <hi>Maures</hi> Abbey, but that paſſage alſo was ſtopped the next day after with boates, which deſcended thether.</p>
               <p>The 26. day, Captaine <hi>Serpent</hi> ſkirmiſhed all the day long, as hee had done all night before, out of the Abbey Saint <hi>Maure</hi> with the enemies, who were in the boates.</p>
               <p>The Papiſts of high and low <hi>Poytow,</hi> vnderſtanding how the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> was compaſſed on euery ſide beyond <hi>Loyre,</hi> and ſuppoſing that hee was alreadie made ſure, enterpriſed to doo the like of the Lord <hi>Laual,</hi> and theſe few companies which were with him. Whereupon Captaine <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,</hi> ſeeing that the Prince did not repaſſe, and that the enemie was armed vpon the riuer, being out of hope of his returne that way, diſlodged out of S. <hi>Maure</hi> Abbey, where the enemie ſoone after lodged, and ioyned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with the Lord <hi>Laual</hi> the 17. day. The Lord <hi>Laual</hi> notwithſtanding, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> day earlie in the morning, marched toward the paſſage, for to vnderſtand newes of the Prince, but conſidering the impoſſibilitie of repaſſing, and foreſeeing that he would take ouer the Countrey, and that if he ſhould ſtay there any time, he was like to be hemmed in by the troupes of high and lowe <hi>Poytow,</hi> which haſted to ſet vpon him: hee therefore with Captaine <hi>Serpent</hi> tooke his iourney to Saint <hi>Ihan D' Angely.</hi> The ſame day the Lord <hi>Boulay</hi> (ſeeing as much as is aforeſaid) folowed after the L. <hi>Laual,</hi> and ouertooke him two Leagues from the riuer. Theſe two companies ioyned together, made about 150. horſe, and about 300. Harquebuſiers on horſeback, for many of their companies had not paſſed, and ſome had retired where they thought to bee in ſecuritie. They marched with reaſonable iourneys, paſſing aboue <hi>Niort</hi> to Saint <hi>Ihan D' Angely</hi> without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance.</p>
               <p>The 29. of October, they came to Saint <hi>Maſſure</hi> about <hi>Niort,</hi> where they found the bridge which they muſt needes paſſe ouer broaken: for the raine was ſo great and continuall, that it had made little ſmall brookes great riuers, and hauing none other way to paſſe, there they made a bridge with cartes, and other ſuch things as were at hand.</p>
               <p>The 30. of October, the Lord <hi>Laual</hi> lodged at <hi>Fors,</hi> and his companies in the vilages thereabouts.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:8966:48"/>
The 31. of October in the morning, parting thence as they tooke their horſes to goe on their iourney, there apeared vnto them ſome Launcieres of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1585.

               <p>The ſecond day of Nouember the Lord <hi>Laual</hi> aryued at Saynt <hi>Ihan</hi> where y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> company of the Lord <hi>Boulay</hi> retyred euery one where he thought <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Nouemb."/> good. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
               </p>
               <p>A thing happened worthy of remembrance, the peſtilence being very hot in Saynt <hi>Ihan D'Angelye,</hi> when the Lord <hi>Laual</hi> arryued there, yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward there dyed not ſo much as one of his companyes, nor of the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitantes of the towne.</p>
               <p>As all thinges are gouerned by the prouidence of God, diſpoſing of the counſelles and actions of men after his owne will: ſo he turned all thinges to the benefite of his children, and the preſeruation of his Church. For the Prince, as is aboue ſayd, hauing ſent the ſaid Lord <hi>Laual</hi> to paſſe to <hi>Loyre</hi> before, to fauour the paſſage of the reſt of the army, delaying his owne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, and in the meane time the riuer being beſet by the enemy, ſo it fell out, that the ſayd Lordes <hi>Laual,</hi> and <hi>Bowlay,</hi> could not repaſſe to the Prince agayne. This great good therefore the Lord did draw out of this diſiunction of the army.</p>
               <p>Firſt, here appeareth euidently the gracious loue &amp; fauour, which God beareth to his children. For the power of man which was ſo great, the ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cor and hatred ſo hot, the ſtomacke ſo eger, the enemy ſpread ſo thicke eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where round about, lying in wayt for them, and making their full ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to haue them as in a net, yet could they not take away one hayre of their heads, whom God had taken vnder his protection.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the ſame Lord was diſioyned from the Prince by a certayne counſell of God, to confirme the townes and ſtrong places in <hi>Poytow,</hi> and <hi>Xainctonge,</hi> and to let them from reuolting to the enemy, to reſemble the companies ſcattered and beaten, with the breaking of that army, to hold the enemy in awe: ſo that in ſuch great diſmay and feare of all the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, the enemy durſt enterprize but very litle, or nothing at all. For euen the Duke <hi>de Mayne</hi> with his ſtrong and puiſſant army paſſing nigh the gates of Saynt <hi>Ihan D'Angelye</hi> durſt neuer ſtay there: although he knew well that the towne was not well prouided, and his army being for <hi>Guy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enne,</hi> there hee might haue begun to do ſome more honorable exployt by winning Saynt <hi>Ihan,</hi> then by <hi>Castilon.</hi> By the which euents it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that the preſence of the ſayd Lord, and other of his company did greatly bridle the rage of the enemy there.</p>
               <p>Now hauing placed the Prince, his Nobles, and all his ſcattered army
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:8966:48"/>
in ſafety and reſt from the great dangers and labours which they ſuſtayned during the moneth of October, we will returne backe to ſee what in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1585.

               <p>The tenth day of October the Lord Saint <hi>Meſmes,</hi> who was left there to continue the ſiege by the appoyntment of the Prince, receaued intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence how that the gouernor of <hi>Xainctes, Coignak, Engoleſme,</hi> and other forces of the countrey, did flocke together to ſet vppon them who were at <hi>Hyers,</hi> where they continued the ſiege of <hi>Browage:</hi> and ſuppoſing himſelfe not ſtrong ynough, to reſiſt ſuchforces as he expected, ſpecially for lacke of horſemen, forſooke <hi>Hyers,</hi> &amp; with all his regiments lodged at <hi>Marennes.</hi> Which thing amazed greatly the Countrey: hee ſent alſo the Lord <hi>la Hay</hi> at Saynt <hi>Iuſt</hi> to aduauncethe retyre.</p>
               <p>The ſame day about foure a clocke in the euening aryuing at Saynt <hi>Juſt</hi> the Lord Saynt <hi>Diſan,</hi> and Captayne <hi>Bordeaux,</hi> with their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of footmen: who ſeeing the inhabitantes of the countrey runne away and knowing what had happened, went to <hi>Hiers,</hi> and they there arryued about midnight, where they found many ſouldiers of Saynt <hi>Luke,</hi> who iſſued out of <hi>Browage,</hi> had ſet the fire on ſome houſes, and were buſie in rifling, and ranſacking the others: they were ſo heauily charged by the Souldiers of Saint <hi>Diſan,</hi> and <hi>Bordeaux,</hi> that they were all eyther ſlaine or taken priſonners.</p>
               <p>The Lord Saynt <hi>Meſmes</hi> aduertized what had paſſed at <hi>Hyers,</hi> and of the new ſupply come to him, returned with the companies to <hi>Hyers,</hi> and continued the ſiege twenty dayes longer, during the which tyme were ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen many ſkirmiſhes, and many on both ſides ſlayne and taken. But at length the ſayd Lord Saynt <hi>Meſmes</hi> knowing that the Prince had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Loyre,</hi> and looking not for any ſuccour, and that many reportes going abroad of his ill ſucceſſe, and that many Souldiours did dayly depart and other waxed faynte, &amp; that aduertiſementes came of the ſuccor, which the gouernours of the aboueſayd Townes would geue to <hi>Browage,</hi> and that they intended to encloſe him and his companies, in the Iles (as it had béen an eaſy thing to do) with the aduiſe of his Captaynes, determined to raiſe the ſiege.</p>
               <p>Hee ſent alſo to the Lord <hi>Ranques,</hi> who was left to commaund in the Ile of <hi>Oleron,</hi> to aduertize him, that hee was preſſed to retyre, willing him to repayre to him, that they might retyre in a ſtronge company to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent further milfortune. So the 2. day of Nouember, he rhyſed the ſiege, and tooke his iourney towards <hi>Charuaut.</hi> At the paſſage whereof was great diſorder, which cauſed that at a place called <hi>Loupin,</hi> part of the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage was taken by the enemyes, and many Souldiers lead away priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, the reſidue retyred ſome to <hi>Rochel,</hi> &amp; ſome to Saint <hi>Ihan D'angelye.</hi>

The Lord <hi>Ranques,</hi> notwithſtanding remayned in <hi>Oleron</hi> with the <hi>Nauall</hi> army vntill the tenth of Nouember: during the which time hee ſent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1585.

               <p>This alſo made him the more willing, becauſe he had diſcouered one Countie, and a Franciſcane Fryer, who had béen alwaies during the ſiege hidden in the Iland, who were ſent to the Lord Saynt <hi>Luke,</hi> to practize with him agaynſt the ſayd Lord <hi>Ranques,</hi> whom when he would haue pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, they of the Iland withſtood him, ſo that fearing the worſt he rety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to <hi>Rochel</hi> not without danger of his life.</p>

               <p>It is ſayd, how the Lord Saint <hi>Meſmes</hi> (at the departing of the Prince of <hi>Conde)</hi> had the charge of the ſiege of <hi>Browage.</hi> Now the Lord <hi>Matignon</hi> who co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded for the King in <hi>Guyenne,</hi> vnderſtanding that Saint <hi>Luke</hi> was hardly preſſed, and that the Prince taking his iourney to <hi>Angers,</hi> had left a ſmall company to continue the ſiege of <hi>Browage,</hi> determined to oppreſſe them: and about the latter end of October from <hi>Bourde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aux</hi> tooke eight hundred horſemen, foure thouſand footmen, with foure double Canons, and arryued in <hi>Xainctonge</hi> about the third of Nouember: which vnderſtanding that they of <hi>Hiers</hi> had rayſed vp the ſiege, and had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retyred to <hi>Rochell,</hi> and <hi>S.

               </p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Laual</hi> about the eight of Nouember, aduertized that the Lord <hi>Matignon</hi> was in the field (not farre from the town) with all his horſemen and ſome footemen, iſſued out of S. <hi>Ihan</hi> about two leagues from the towne: he encountered the ſayd <hi>Matignon:</hi> they ſaw one another ſo nigh, that the Lord <hi>Chargoys</hi> (who did leade the light horſes of the ſayd Lord <hi>Laual)<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

That Caſtel is ſtrong by ſituation, and on diuers ſides inacceſſible ſituated vpon a rocke, compaſſed with the towne, otherwiſe not ſtrong. The houſes for the moſt part are builded at the foote of the rocke. The ſaid Caſtell is fortifyed with platformes by nature, and do commaund on euery ſyde as well ouer the Towne as ouer the fieldes. <hi>Charante</hi> of one ſide doth waſh the foot of that rocke. There is a fayre and commodious bridge to paſſe ouer the riuer. All theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, with the diſfauour of the time, gaue <hi>Matygnon</hi> great deſire to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe that place. Yet the ſpeciall commaundement which hee had from the King to ſeaze vpon the Mother and the Daughter, vrged him the more to attempt vppon that Caſtell, that ſo he might ſtop the mariage begun.</p>
               <p>It happened about the thirtéenth of Nouember, that the Lord <hi>Matyg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi> was commaunded to retyre toward <hi>Garonne,</hi> to méete the Counſels of the Vicount <hi>Turenne,</hi> who with ſix thouſand Souldiers was in <hi>Limoſin,</hi> and had taken the City of <hi>Triles:</hi> or for ſome other occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, hauing conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the Duke <hi>de Maine</hi> to meete with all their forces in <hi>Agenoys,</hi> to ſtop the paſſages of <hi>Garonne</hi> to the King of <hi>Nauarre.</hi>

               <p>They within the Caſtell reſiſted this force with ſhot of ordinance, &amp; did rowle great heauy ſtones vpon the howſes, to beate them downe. The ſkirmiſhes did dure fiue dayes.</p>

               <p>The 20. day at night, captaine <hi>Pickard</hi> came out of <hi>Xainctes,</hi> with 120. with him into the towne for ſuccour.</p>

In the beginning, the enemies defended themſelues ſtoutely, as well out of the houſes as out of the Trenches, which they had planted at the gate of the Caſtell. They of the Caſtell (perceauing that ſuccour was come to them) leaueled their artilerie, partlie againſt the Trenches, partly againſt the houſes, among whom, the houſe of one <hi>Bordet</hi> was cleane beate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> down. The diuers charges began to amaze the enemies, which without long re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, began to looke how to ſaue themſelues, and their liues by flight or otherwiſe.

The ſaid Lord commaunded his brother, the Lorde <hi>Ryeulx</hi> to charge them: who with twelue horſes ſet on them, whereof ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny were killed, ſome wounded, and ſome taken with foure enſignes.</p>
               <p>The enemies being thus beaten, the Lady <hi>Trimouil</hi> gratified the ſaid Lord <hi>Laual</hi> with the other Noble men, who had accompanied him, for the aſſiſtance giuen her in ſuch a conuenient time.

They met nigh <hi>Varezes</hi> a little towne not farre diſtant, twentie Launciers of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie, folowed at hand, by two hundered men of warre, <hi>French,</hi> and <hi>Jtali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> The ſaide <hi>Chaſſegay</hi> was charged with theſe troupes, and purſued to the bridge, where hee ſtayed in the face of the enemie, to fauour the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traite of his men, but there he was beaten downe, and taken priſoner with ſome others: they which ſaued themſelues, gaue the alarum in the towne, the forces whereof iſſued out, but the enemie had retired.</p>
               <p>About the latter end of December, the Duke méeting with the Marſhal
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:8966:51"/>
                  <hi>Matignon</hi> about <hi>Coignake,</hi> at length parted a ſunder, and the ſayd <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tignon</hi> went to <hi>Bourdeaux:</hi> but the Duke being rid of the companie of <hi>Matignon,</hi> who would bée but a let vnto him to bring to paſſe his intents, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1585. Nouemb."/> tooke his iourney to ſport himſelfe through <hi>Perigord, Limoſin, Quercy,</hi> and <hi>Agennoys,</hi> at the charges of the Prieſts, and expences of the holy Rood, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a great deale of money, euen ſo much as the Sacraficers could ſpare, to recreate himſelfe, when hée ſhould finde himſelfe wearie of winning of Cities and ſtrong Holds in thoſe countreys.</p>
               <p>It is ſayd before, how that after the publication of the Edict in Iuly, the Vicount <hi>Turenne</hi> had aſſembled ſome forces, partly out of his owne land in <hi>Limoſin</hi> and <hi>Perigord,</hi> and partly many Noble men and Captaines of the countreys about had repayred vnto him. For the perſecutions had inforced many, as well Gentlemen as others, to forſake their houſes to take armes, and to repayre to ſuch Prouinces as were of ſure acceſſe vnto them. This was the cauſe that Noble men and Gentlemen from about <hi>Paris, Gastinoys, Niuernoys,</hi> countries betwéene the riuers of <hi>Loyre</hi> and <hi>Seyne,</hi> (which purpoſed to repayre to the King of <hi>Nauarre)</hi> ioyned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues with the Lord <hi>Turenne,</hi> who within a ſhort ſpace grew to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſixe thouſand.</p>
               <p>With this power the Vicount <hi>Turenne</hi> kept the field in <hi>Limoſin</hi> &amp; <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigord:</hi> and about the time that the Prince departed from <hi>Browage</hi> to his iourney to <hi>Angers,</hi> letters came vnto him from the Prince, by the which he willed him to drawe néere <hi>Browage</hi> to fauour the ſiege thereof. Vppon the receipt of theſe letters, the Lord <hi>Turenne</hi> called his counſell together, to knowe what was to be done. There was then reaſoned among them of the neceſſitie of his preſence at that ſiege. On the other ſide, aduertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was giuen that the armie of the League (vnder the conduct of the Duke <hi>de Mayne)</hi> was drawing nigh toward <hi>Guyenne,</hi> (although it was not yet ſcarſe out of <hi>Paris)</hi> and that the ſame was beaten with diuers diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes, (and among others the Swiſſers) which made them conclude, that occaſion might be giuen to worke ſome good exployt vpon that armie; and if not diſcomfited, yet greatly it might be moleſted. Agayne, he had recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued letters of the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> who aduertized him, that he was at the poynt to depart out of <hi>Bearne</hi> to <hi>Bergerake</hi> ward in <hi>Perigord,</hi> and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore warned him to be in a readines, that (if néede ſhould be) he might ioyne with his Maieſtie. So that conſidering all theſe waightie occaſions, hée could not ſuccour the ſiegr of <hi>Browage,</hi> ſtaying for the Duke <hi>de Mayne,</hi> and expecting the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> his comming. He had many good oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions to enterprize vpon certaine Townes in <hi>Limoſin,</hi> as vpon the Citie of <hi>Trile, Brune la galiarde,</hi> and others in thoſe quarters. <hi>Trile</hi> is a Citie in <hi>Limoſin,</hi> a Biſhops ſeate, ſituated in a valley, compaſſed about with high hilles, which doo commaund the Towne: It hath thrée fayre Suburbs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:8966:51"/>
it, and there is a little riuer named <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>eſtere,</hi> which waſhing the walls paſſeth by the Suburb, which is greater than the citie. Therein is a Frie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1585. Nouemb."/> of the <hi>Franciſcans,</hi> which is incloſed about with a ſtrong wall, and for that cauſe the inhabitants had retyred and committed their goods to the Friers keeping: which thing fell out very ill for them. The high ſuburbe is like the firſt in greatnes: the third is leſſer than the other twaine.</p>
               <p>The 8. day of Nouember the Lord <hi>Choupes,</hi> with a great number of Gentlemen and Souldiers, ſet on the lowe Suburbe. The Lord <hi>Turenne</hi> (who commaunded ouer the Harquebuſiers which came out of <hi>France)</hi> ſtaying at the <hi>Franciſcans</hi> houſe, which is ſituated at the ende of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbe, ſet the gate on a fire, and vppon occaſion entered further euen to the Trenches, which they of the Towne had made: and after long ſkirmiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and killing of ſome of both parts, wonne the ſame.</p>
               <p>The high Suburbe at the ſame time, by other companies (as they were appoynted) was alſo aſſaulted, which they of the Suburbe did reſiſt at the Trenches: but at length enforced, did retyre within the Towne. They of the Towne being beſieged all round about, defended themſelues vpon the walls (without iſſuing out at all) for the ſpace of ſixe daies.</p>
               <p>The 13. day of Nouember were applied two péeces at the gate, which made ſome way to enter in: but they of the Towne did their endeuour to defend the breach; which being not aſſaultable, the aſſault was giuen ouer. The ſiege continuing, many of the Towne were ſlaine: which cauſed the reſt (fearing to bee forced) not to refuſe the perſwaſions of <hi>Amaury,</hi> who counſelled them to capitulate. Hoſtages being giuen of both ſides, the Kings Lieutenant (with ſome of the chiefeſt Citizens) came foorth to the Lord <hi>Turenne,</hi> who was lodged at the gray Friers; the agréement was long debated, and at length concluded.</p>
               <p>The 16. day of Nouember, they of the Towne conſented to redéeme the Towne, and the ranſaking of their houſes, with a certaine ſumme of money. Furthermore, it was agréed that a Captaine ſtranger, with ſuch as were left of his companie (for moſt of them had béen ſlaine) ſhould goe foorth out of their Towne, and they ſhould receiue Captaine <hi>Amaury.</hi> This Captaine <hi>Amaury</hi> was he of all the armie whom they feared moſt, and yet did they requeſted to haue him, whom they receaued for their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour: and there he remayned in that charge vntill the comming of the Duke <hi>de Mayne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About the 10. of December (conſidering that the place was not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to reſiſt ſuch an armie) he gaue ouer the Towne into the hands of the Citizens, and within fewe dayes after was ſlaine, as followeth. Within a while after the taking of this Citie, the Lord <hi>Turenne</hi> retired his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies in garriſons in places of greater importance.</p>
               <p>The 25. of December, <hi>Amaury</hi> was aduertized that the Lord <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more</hi>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:8966:52"/>
of <hi>Birague,</hi> (this is that <hi>Sacramore</hi> whom after the Duke <hi>de Mayne</hi> killed in his anger with his owne hand) one of the Leaguers, was not farr <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1585.

               </p>
               <p>The Duke <hi>de Mayne</hi> ſporting himſelfe, made good théere at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prieſts coſts, (but it was no matter, for holy Roode did pay for all) and doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer Kingdomes in <hi>Perigord</hi> and <hi>Limoſin:</hi> and about the 27. of Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber tooke <hi>Montignake le conte,</hi> an olde Towne and ruinous Caſtle belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the King of <hi>Nauarre.</hi> He tooke alſo <hi>Beaulieu,</hi> ſuch a Fort as no man (which hath any ſkill in warlike affayres) would make any accompt of. And ten daies after, the inhabitants (who were al of the reformed religion) redeemed their Towne with one thouſand Crownes, which were payed to <hi>Antefort.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About the 17. of December the Duke <hi>de Mayne</hi> recouered <hi>Trile,</hi> which the Lord <hi>Turenne</hi> had cauſed <hi>Amaury</hi> to ſurrender into the hands of the inhabitants about ten daies before, becauſe that place was not defenſable. The D. <hi>de Mayne</hi> at length perceiuing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his practiſes againſt the Cities and Townes of <hi>Limoſin</hi> &amp; <hi>Perigord</hi> would not frame, determined to paſſe the riuer <hi>Dordonne</hi> at <hi>Souliake</hi> into <hi>Quercy,</hi> leauing behind him <hi>Monfort,</hi> a ſtrong place, and many other Townes and Holds, becauſe hee could not carrie them away with him.</p>
               <p>It is ſayd before, how that the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> in Auguſt laſt, went into <hi>Languedock</hi> to S. <hi>Paul de Cadeioux,</hi> where he met with the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Monmorency,</hi> to aduertiſe them of their defence. The ſayd King remayned afterward in <hi>Bearne,</hi> in great ſilence and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, viewing how farre all this league and vnion would proceede, expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the producing of ſome lamentable euents, and (as if it were out of his watch) would become of the thrée great armies prepared for <hi>Guyenne, Languedock</hi> and <hi>Daulphine:</hi> and (being hidden vnder the wing of the moſt high) muſed what would bee the end of the fierie threatnings and bragges of his enemies, bearing patiently their inſolencie, euen to the danger of his owne perſon.</p>
               <p>It is alſo ſayd, how that the Leaguers had procured an excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from Frier <hi>Sixtus</hi> vicar of <hi>Rome,</hi> againſt the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> &amp; the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> therewithall (and with the ſedicious inuaighing of the Ieſuits and Friers) to make them odious vnto the people, whoſe liues they could not touch, neither by violence, nor by any haynous act. It is ſayd alſo, how the Senat of <hi>Paris</hi> gaue their iudgement (by the way of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition) to the King againſt the ſayd excommunication, the Pope him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and the procurers of the ſame.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:8966:52"/>
The ſixt day of Nouember, the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> anſwereth to the ſaid excommunication of that beggerly Frier <hi>Sixtus,</hi> and cauſed the ſame an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere to bee ſet and fixed vpon the corners of the ſtreates in <hi>Rome,</hi> where <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1585.

               <p>Firſt, he doth hold the ſayd excommunication falſe, wrongfull, &amp; voyd, and doth appeale from him as no Iudge, vnto the Senat of the Péeres of <hi>France,</hi> whereof he is the firſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, whereas the ſayd franticke <hi>Sixtus</hi> dooth lay hereſie to his charge, and preſumptuouſly calleth him hereticke, the ſayd King in one word doth anſwere, that he maliciouſly and moſt impudently (with reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of his gooſe cap be it ſpoken) doth lye.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the ſayd King doth charge the beggerly Frier <hi>Sixtus</hi> to be an hereticke himſelfe, and doth proffer to prooue him ſo in a generall Counſell lawfully aſſembled.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, he doth declare him Antichriſt, and as vnto ſuch a one he doth denounce a perpetuall and irreconciliable warre, vntill that the miurie done to the houſe of <hi>France</hi> be ſatiſfied.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, he aſſureth himſelfe in God, that (as he hath aſſiſted his prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, and made them able to chaſtize ſuch ſawcie companions, as he is, when they haue forgotten their duetie, and paſſed the bounds of their vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, confounding the eccleſiaſticall power with the ciuill): So he tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth in God, that being nothing inferiour vnto them, God will make him able to reuenge the iniurie offered to the King, Crowne, State, and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſt of all, hee dooth implore all Chriſtian Kings and Potentates, all States, alied and confederated with the Crowne of <hi>France,</hi> to aſſiſt him, to repreſſe the raging tyrannie and damnable vſurpation of the ſayd Frier <hi>Sixtus,</hi> and of all Leaguers, and conſpirators agaynſt the Crowne of <hi>France.</hi> So much alſo doth proteſt <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Bourbon</hi> Prince of <hi>Conde.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This anſwere of the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> being fixed (as is ſayd in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary places of <hi>Rome,</hi> where ſuch writinges are wont to be ſet) did not moue Frier <hi>Sixtus</hi> to repentance: but as being <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>About the 11. of Nouember, the King ſendeth forth an iniunction to all his officers, to ſeaze vpon the perſons and goods of al them that haue born armes with the Prince of <hi>Conde:</hi> who after the breaking of the army at <hi>Saloune,</hi> had returned to theyr houſes, or returned to their friends: and to proceede agaynſt them according to the edict of Iulye, and the declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:8966:53"/>
thereof vearing date the 6. of October.</p>
               <p>Alſo, that ſuch as will be reduced to Popery, he is willing to pardon &amp; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1585. Nouemb."/> to giue them his patents for the ſame, conditionally that they ſhal be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out armes and horſe: and alſo, that they ſhall put in good ſuretyes to perſiſt in the profeſſion of Popery.</p>
               <p>The 19. of Nouember, the Shauelinges, Cardinals, and Biſhops, made a long exhortation to the King by Sir <hi>Emare Henekin</hi> Biſhop of Saynt <hi>Bryen,</hi> a citye in <hi>Britayne.</hi> In the ſame long and tedious oration, Sir <hi>Henekin</hi> firſt did ſhew him the duty of Kinges toward the holy Church, to wit, to magnify it to the vttermoſt of his power.</p>
               <p>Marke this Chriſtian Reader, that by the name of Church, he meaneth <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Note.</hi>
                  </note> the ſhauelings; and by the duty of Kings toward the Church, he (although in other wordes) goeth about to perſwade the King to yeeld himſelfe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner to their willes and affections: and to make it ſhort, to let them haue what they would haue, and to approoue whatſoeuer they would doe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he teacheth the King that it is the holy Ghoſt, who hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired him to make the edict of vnion.</p>
               <p>To make the edict of vnion, was to repleniſh his kingdome with bloud, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Note.</hi>
                  </note> murther, and deſolation, and to yeeld his authority into the handes of trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous conſpiratours of the League: this is a worke of inſpiration of the holy ghoſt, by Sir <hi>Henekyn</hi> his diuinity. Well ſayd Sir <hi>Henekyn,</hi> goe too, this is good ſtuffe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, hee blameth the King, that heretofore he hath not ſhewed cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty ynough agaynſt them of the reformed, but hath ſuffered them to haue the liberty of theyr religion, by his edictes of peace: but now he truſteth, (that hauing reuoked the edict of peace) he would play <hi>Pyrgopolynices</hi> in <hi>Plautus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here Sir <hi>Henekyn</hi> ſheweth whoſe ſonne hee is, breathing nothing <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Note.</hi>
                  </note> but murther, and whoſe ſcholler, to wit, Antichriſt of <hi>Rome,</hi> which is the trompeter of all miſchieues in Chriſtendome.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, after breach of the edict of peace, <hi>Henekyn</hi> hopeth that the King will play the man, and that all thinges ſhall goe well.</p>
               <p>Here Sir <hi>Henekyn</hi> dooth ſuppoſe, that all thinges ſhall goe well, <note place="margin">

                  </note> when the King hath throwen himſelfe, his Nobility, his Kingdome, and Subiectes into a heape of miſeryes, and hath opened the dore to deſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and deſperation moſt miſerable: this is to haue a new heauen and earth to Sir <hi>Henekyn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, he aſſureth the King, that he ſhall haue power ynough to breake the forces of the Heretikes.</p>
               <p>Here Sir <hi>Henekyn</hi> knowing not, that there is neither counſell, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Note.</hi>
                  </note> nor power againſt God, to reſiſt his will, warranteth the King (like a good diuine) that he ſhall performe what Sir <hi>Henekyn</hi> wiſheth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:8966:53"/>
Sixtly, hee willeth the King to vſe ſuch diſcipline among his Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, as that the Prieſtes be not moleſted by them. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1585. Nouemb."/>
               </p>
               <p>Here Sir <hi>Henekyn,</hi> foreſeeing what euilles the breach of the edict of peace would breede, is well content that other men periſh, ſo that hee <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Note.</hi>
                  </note> and his fellowes may liue in all pleaſures and voluptuouſnes, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny moleſtation. Sir <hi>Henekyn</hi> is a good, reaſonable, and kindly fellow.</p>
               <p>Seuenthly, hee willeth the King to publiſh the counſell of <hi>Trente,</hi> and to reforme the Prieſtes, and to cauſe them to be good and vertuous.</p>
               <p>The King hath reſigned into the handes of the Leaguers a great part of his roiall authority. Now Sir <hi>Henekyn</hi> will haue him to publiſh <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Note.</hi>
                  </note> the counſell of <hi>Trente,</hi> that is, to reſigne the reſt of his royall authority to Fryer <hi>Sixtus.</hi> I thinke that his minde is in plaine tearmes, the King to become a begging Frier: and to goe to Fryer <hi>Sixtus</hi> to haue a diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to forſake his wife, and to enter into a Fryery. But if the king would follow good counſell, he ſhould keepe himſelfe as he is.</p>
               <p>For the eight point, he praieth the king to geue ouer the preferring and placing of Abbots and Biſhops to their liuings, but to referre that to the Prieſtes themſelues, to the Chapters of Canons, and Monkes: and to leaue the diſpoſition of Biſhoprickes and Abbeyes to their elections and diſcretions.</p>
               <p>Here Sir <hi>Henekyn</hi> is very carefull for the king: he willeth him to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare to ſwallow ſuch big morſels, as Biſhopricks and Abbeyes, for the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Note.</hi>
                  </note> daunger which may enſue, which is choaking: but to leaue ſuch fat mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels to them that haue throats big ynough to ſwallow down whole Stée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>
               <p>The king hath reſigned part of his royall authority to the Leaguers: now to do well he ſhall reſigne another part to Frier <hi>Syxtus,</hi> and the third to the Prieſtes: and then let him walke careleſſe.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, he prayeth the king, to take ſome good order, that the Prieſts may be honoured, renerenced, and capped: and that their iuriſdiction may be reſtored to them, and not interrupted hereafter. <hi>Dixi.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>About the ſame time, one Sir <hi>William Ruſe,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Angers</hi> did ſet foorth in his dioces, vnto al Prieſts, a forme of abiuration, which the ſaid Prieſts ſhould enforce vpon them, that had profeſſed the true religion, and had obeyed, or would obey the Kings edict.

                  </note> Catholick and Apoſtolick Church. The perſecutions, impriſonments, ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing of goods, and abiurations, had begun and went forward in diuers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but eſpeciallie in ſuch as were addicted to the League long before, and had receaued the laſt edict ſet forth by the King. And among other places, there is a towne in <hi>Poytow,</hi> called <hi>Niort,</hi> great and rich, where the faires and martes of the countrey beyond <hi>Loyre</hi> are kept. This towne had béen ſeduced of long time, and of all townes in <hi>France</hi> moſt earneſtly adicted to the League: there of all places, and in the townes there abouts, they began moſt cruelly to perſecute the Church, which was aſſembled at Saint <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays,</hi> in the which perſecution, many bowed downe the knee to <hi>Baall.</hi> Therefore, about the 20. of December, <hi>Lewis Blachiere,</hi> Paſtor of that Church, hauing retired to <hi>Rochel,</hi> and vnderſtanding the fall of many in that heate of perſecution, writeth a letter to raiſe them that are fallen, and to binde that which was broken.</p>
               <p>In the which, firſt hee ſheweth the vſe of perſecution, that is, to diſcerne the true Diſciples of Chriſt, from falſe bretheren and hypocrits, who yeeld and turne after euery winde of doctrine.</p>
               <p>Secondly, hee dooth terrifie them that are fallen, by the threatnings of Chriſt againſt them, that ſhall denie him before men.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, he detecteth the ſubtiltie of the enemie, in the forme of his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuration, in that he hath made a doore of golde, to enter into a priuy or dongeon full of filth, ſtinking and poyſoned ayre, placing in the beginning the <hi>Nicen</hi> ſimbole, afterward patcheth to it all the filthie abominations of Antichriſt.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, hee ſheweth to them that are fallen, the gate of mercie to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine

               </p>
               <p>Now will we begin the third Booke with the beginning of Ianuarie.

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:8966:56"/>
in the middle of warre, and that hee hath often times remitted ſundrie and great iniuries done to him, in reſpect of the publick peace. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1586. Ianuarie"/>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, he complaineth of them, that they doo aſſiſt with their power and meanes them, who making their ambition, a zeale to holy Church, and the reuenging of their priuat diſcontentments with a publick warre, haue ſet the whole realme in a miſerable cumbuſtion.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, hee letteth them vnderſtand, that he feareth neither their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, their names, nor the armes of his enemies, but pittyeth the ſtate of the poore people, who doth ſuffer all the oppreſſions and miſeries which will enſue theſe enterprizes of his enemies.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, he threatneth them, that they who ſhould be the vpholders of peace, and the ſupport of the poore people, ſhall anſwere before God, for all the bloodſhed, confuſions, vices, and miſeryes which the warre caryeth with it, for entertayning with their meanes, and noriſhing with their goods, this vniuſt and damnable warre, with the diſorders which inſue thereof.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, hee proteſteth that hee hath proffered himſelfe to be tryed by a conference and diſtentation in a free counſel, but they haue preferred war, fire and ſword before theſe good, lawdable, and ordinary meanes of confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, which is moſt worthy of man.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all, he ſheweth them that this warre is moſt vnworthy of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, but ſpecially of ſuch as do pretend to bee teachers and Doctors of the Goſpell, and committing his innocency and iuſt cauſe to God, war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth them, that the dangers of warre are common as well to them as to him and his: ſo maketh an end with them.</p>
               <p>Vnto the Nobility hee rehearſeth the ſumme of all thinges paſſed euer ſince the raiſing vp of the League.</p>
               <p>Firſt, how that in the middeſt of peace, theſe ſturres are bred and borne.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he reciteth with what patience he hath borne all the iniuries proffered vnto him by the Leaguers, who haue made him the ſubiect and ſcope of their warre.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, he putteth them in remembrance of all the Kings actions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the edict of vnion, how the King declared them rebels, and perſwaded them, as ſuch in all his courtes of Parliament. And how they, to wit, the Nobility, haue béen armed agaynſt the Leaguers, and that all theſe acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the king did proceed out of a good and ſound iudgement &amp; free wil, without any compulſion.</p>
               <p>He willeth them to remember alſo, how on a ſudden all theſe thinges haue béen chaunged, and the kinges will not chaunge, but partly enforced, and partly by the craft of the enemies, with ill counſell induced to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry actions.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, he complayneth of the iniuries done to them of the reformed
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:8966:56"/>
religion, who heretofore had béene ſuffered with liberty of the free exerciſe of the ſame, without any offence by them geuen, and armed by the kinges <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1586. Ianuarie"/> authority againſt the Leaguers, now to be condemned in reſpect of their religion, as guilty of capitol cryme.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, hee declareth how for the auoyding the calamities incident to warre to ſatiſfy vnto the Leaguers, he hath debaſed himſelfe ſo farre vnder his degree, as to proffer to the heads of the League, the combat to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by himſelf in perſon, or by more, number to number, as by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſary it ſhould bee accepted.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, he letteth them vnderſtand, that hee feareth not their armes, whereof he hath had the experience ſo long time, whereby he knoweth well what they are able to do.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all, hee cannot but lament their bloud which they haue, and do ſpill againſt him, for whoſe ſeruice they ſhould haue reſerued it in ſtoare.</p>
               <p>But ſpecially this doth greeue him, that in the lot of the battell he may not diſcerne them whom in mind hee diſcerneth from his enemies.</p>
               <p>Vnto the third eſtate he writeth to the ſame purpoſe, as he hath done to the Nobility, and beſides ſheweth vnto them firſt the horrible miſeries which they haue ſuſtained by the ciuill warre, and what confuſions are like to enſue of theſe troubles. He ſheweth alſo how the end of all the former wars hath béene a peace.</p>
               <p>Secondly, whereas they (meaning the Leaguers) do pretend to eaſe the people of taxes and charges, hee aduertyzeth them, that by this warre the taxes, impoſt, and ſubſidies muſt needs to double, and that their ryſing in armes hath done already terrible hauocke and waſt. He warneth them alſo to conſider how that the reformation of impoſt, taxes &amp; ſubſidies, they haue turned to their priuat commodity, hauing done nothing, but enforce the king to deuide his realme among them, and to weaken his authority, without making mention not one word of the eaſing of the people. Hee writeth the ſame effect to the inhabitantes of <hi>Paris:</hi> but <hi>ſurdis narrat fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulam.</hi> The contempt of the Goſpel, the innocent blood of the Saintes which they haue ſpilled like water muſt be better reuenged. The wrath of God muſt walke now beyond <hi>Loyre,</hi> to execute his iudgements vpon theſe nations, that lye betweene the low countrey and <hi>Loyre,</hi> becauſe they haue not repented at the former ſcourges, but haue hardened their hartes, and haue blaſphemed the God who liueth for euermore.</p>
               <p>The diſperſing of the Princes armie, and declaration of the edict of v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion dated the ſeauenth day of October, did caſt a marueilous amaze and dread vppon all them of the religion generally: but ſpecially vppon them who were left through the Popiſh countreys in <hi>France,</hi> hoping for a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter time.</p>
               <p>There were alſo many of the contrary religion, who being louers of
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:8966:57"/>
the State, and wiſhing well to the houſe of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> and to the right of the cauſe, began to wauer and to alter their minds according to the vnablenes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1586. Ianuarie"/> of fortune, and the nature of the euents.</p>
               <p>There followed after in December, the bloudie procéedings of <hi>Ruze</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Angers,</hi> and the Kings Iniunction to his officers to execute his edict, with the allowing of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> abiuration penned by rauening <hi>Ruze.</hi> Theſe things made a great diſſipation in the families of them of the religion. For by theſe meanes the rage of the Papiſts encreaſed agaynſt the reformed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and emboldened to attempt any violence and iniurie agaynſt them. For the enemies ſuppoſing that the Prince had béen loſt, (for it was very long time afore it was knowne what was become of him) they iudged alſo that the faith and hope of them of the reformed religion had béen buried with him.</p>
               <p>The inconſtancie of many of them who had remayned in <hi>France,</hi> after the declaration of the edict of Iuly, did appeare. For many eſtéemed more the commodities of their houſes, and the pleaſures of their countrey, than the quietnes of their conſciences, and the keeping of thoſe good precepts which they had learned in the ſchoole of Chriſt, which is rather to dye vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Croſſe, than to liue in committing Idolatrie.</p>
               <p>The Papiſts on the contrary ſide, forgat no meanes to throwe downe them that ſtoode on ſlipperie places: for beſide the rigour of the edict which had abridged the time of anoydance to fifteene daies, with dreadful threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, the Ieſuites, Friers, Maſſing and pariſh Prieſts, and other fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brands of the Romiſh route, thundered agaynſt them, whom they tearmed hereticks in their bloudie and ſedicious ſermons.

               <p>In this auoydance there was a number murthered, but ſpecially in thoſe Prouinces where the gouenours were moſt paſſionate and addicted to the League, by whoſe permiſſion the common people tooke much libertie to commit cruell murthers vpon them of the religion.

               </p>
               <p>As this great Duke went downe the riuer, the forerunners met with thirtie ſcattered and vnarmed poore lads, which belonged to the garriſon of <hi>Chaumont:</hi> they were ſent to cauſe the prouiſion (contributed by the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey) to be brought to the ſayd towne of <hi>Chaumont.</hi> Theſe poore lads were killed by theſe ſtout warriors: which notable victorie was afterward pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in <hi>Paris,</hi> by the title of the notable ouerthrowe of the garriſon of <hi>Chaumont</hi> and <hi>Nerake,</hi> by the Duke <hi>de Mayn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next exployt done by this victorious Captaine, was at <hi>Castets.</hi> This is a little towne and a Caſtle belonging to the Lord <hi>Fabas,</hi> which place the Marſhall <hi>Matignon</hi> had beſieged before the ſpace of ten dayes before the Dukes comming, and had made a ſufficient breach.

               </p>
               <p>The next place was <hi>Meylan,</hi> an olde ruinous Towne, wherein was Captaine <hi>Melune</hi> with a ſmall garriſon, who conſidering the weaknes of the place gaue it ouer, ſuppoſing that it was more profitable to let y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Duke <hi>de Mayne</hi> to haue that place for a while, than to defend it. There the Duke with all his armie tooke great paynes to beate downe old ruinous walles, which no man did defend, leaſt it ſhould be ſayd that he had done nothing.</p>
               <p>From the raſing of the walles of <hi>Meylan,</hi> he went to Saint <hi>Bazeile,</hi> a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="March"/> towne ſituated vpon the riuer of <hi>Garonne,</hi> hauing like ruinous old and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed walles and forts, as the aforeſaid townes had. There were fewe of the religion in garriſon, who after hauing ſuſtayned certayne ſhot of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and aſſaults, they conſidering that it was not a place to obſtinate themſelues therein, compounded to their great aduantage. <hi>Amorith</hi> did neuer ſo reioyce at the winning of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> as this Duke did for Saint <hi>Bazeile.</hi> By &amp; by the Lord <hi>Saiſſeual</hi> (the Dukes Curiero) was ſent to the King in poſt with haſt haſt haſt, to aduertize him of theſe great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, and to fetch money to conquer more.</p>
               <p>This diſpatch done, he marched with this armie to <hi>Monſegne:</hi> This is an old Towne decayed in <hi>Bayadoys,</hi> where the exercize of the reformed religion had béen appoynted to bee had by the edict of peace ſo choſen, not for the ſtrength thereof, but for becauſe it was thought moſt commodious for the whole countrey there to aſſemble. This towne was kept by fewe of the religion: Theſe fewe made ſo little account of that armie, and of the Captaine thereof, that after they had cauſed him to beſtowe two thouſand and ſome hundred ſhot of ordinance, with certayne weekes of ſiege, and certayne aſſaults which were deare vnto the enemie, they yéelded them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues with conditions very honorable, but pernicious to them. For the Souldiers comming foorth with their armes agaynſt faith and promiſe, were ſlaine for the moſt part of them in the middeſt of that cowardly army; part of them notwithſtanding ſaued themſelues and retyred to <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilion,</hi> where afterward they had their penyworth of the enemie for that treacherie, and the death of their fellowes. The towne was giuen to the ſpoyle, but there was nothing found but the bare walles.</p>
               <p>When he had done theſe conqueſts and exploytes vpon the riuer of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronne,</hi> he went to reſt himſelfe at <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> for the ſpace of two moneths, to wit, Aprill and May, and part of Iune, as though he had wonne <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage:</hi> where he practiſed the citizns to the League, and when he was wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of his conſpiring, allured by the pleaſantnes of the place, and felicitie of
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:8966:59"/>
the Countrey, he putteth off the perſon of a Captaine, and played the Poet, in writing ſuch riming verſes as he could, of his loue. And while this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1586.

Whereupon, many who had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce vpon that riuer, being greatly decayed, and ſome hauing broken their credit, and other which were in danger to doo the like, did agree with them of the religion for the opening of the traffick, bleſſing with many bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter curſes, the League, the Captaine, and the armie, which had bragged and promiſed much, and done nothing, but onely prouoked them of the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and waſted the countrey.</p>
               <p>The Duke <hi>de Mayne,</hi> hauing recreated himſelfe ſo long, was vrged by the King (who expected dayly to heare miracles wrought by this captaine and his armie) to lead the ſame out of that citie to doo ſome exploite, more moued by the earneſt ſute of the Lady <hi>de Mayne</hi> his wife, which had a ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack to them of <hi>Chastilion,</hi> at length hee determined to beſiege the ſaide Towne.</p>

Therein the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> had placed the Baron <hi>Salini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ak,</hi> with a ſmall Gariſon, not to obſtinate himſelfe therein, but to miniſter ſome play to that armie, that weary with doing nothing, at length it might be reduced to nothing.

               <p>About the 18. of Iune, at the firſt approache of the enemie, they iſſued out with ſuch courage, that their ſallie coſt the liues of a great number <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Iune"/> of their enemies. They within the towne had made a barticado at the ende of a ſuburb, which they defended ten daies againſt all that armie, and all the ſhot of their Ordinance. But at length, being inforced to retire into the towne, out of the which, they iſſuing oftentimes, gaue many fearefull a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larums and hot ſkirmiſhes vnto the enemie, with the loſſe of the liues of many.</p>
               <p>During this ſiege of <hi>Chastilion,</hi> the Lorde <hi>Saiſsiual</hi> returned from the King, and brought letters of credit, of thirtie thouſand Crownes, but no man was willing to buie ſo deare a piece of paper.

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:8966:60"/>
wiues ſtomack, he would venture that little remuant of credit of his which reſted: wherefore hee cauſed many great rampiers of earth to bee made, as though he had to beſiege <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> The ſiege continued ſeauen weekes, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1586.

On another ſide, Captaine <hi>Beutune,</hi> a man of great valour went forth out of Saint <hi>Foy,</hi> to attempt vpon that armie, and in the conflict, the ſaid <hi>Beutune,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Maligny,</hi> a valiant young Gentleman, Sonne to the Lorde <hi>Beauuoyr,</hi> with two Souldiours more were ſlaine, and the Lord <hi>Piles</hi> hurt.

During this long ſiege, the plague waxed ſo hot within the towne, that of nine hundred there remained but two hundred a liue, whereof many were infected, other were wounded, their Chirurgions were dead, medicines to heale with, powder and ſhot fayled them: there was left but two old women, which ſerued them in ſteade of Chirurgions and cookes. So that God diſpoſed of thoſe inuincible hearts that were almoſt deſtitute of force &amp; meanes of defence, after the diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of ſixe thouſand ſhot of ordinance, &amp; ſeauen weekes of ſiege, at length hauing loſt but ſixe ſkore perſons onely by the lot of warre, and among them, but ſixe Gentlemen onely, <hi>Chastilion</hi> was ſurrendered by compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</p>

               <p>This policie being approued, now they began to pleaſe themſelues in their owne conceites: whereupon the Marſhall <hi>Byron</hi> was appoynted to leade an armie into <hi>Xainctonge:</hi> the Marſhall <hi>Ioyeuſe</hi> was appointed for <hi>Languedock,</hi> the Lord <hi>Ioyeuſe</hi> his ſonne for <hi>Auuergne,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernon</hi> for <hi>Prouance.</hi>

Theſe new armies a preparing were as the rockes, vppon the which this <hi>Sardanapalus</hi> army was caſt and broken to pieces. The ſouldiers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore firſt, and then the Captaynes began to ſlyde away, after they had the ſpoyle of <hi>Chaſtilion,</hi> which was iuſt nothing but the plague, and ſuch as continued with him were imployed yet once more as you ſhall heare.</p>
               <p>There is a litle towne in the way to <hi>Chastilion,</hi> to the City <hi>Perigueux,</hi> named <hi>Puynormand,</hi> in the which there is an old Caſtell belonging to the king of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> wherein the ſayd King had put a Captayne of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike religion, named Captayne <hi>Roux,</hi> not to make warre, but to kéepe the Caſtell as his houſe. The inhabitantes (except a few) were all of the popiſh religion: The perſon himſelfe did neuer depart from thence, kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing well, that for the number of them of the Religion hee needed not to feare. The inhabitantes brought dayly victuals, and the artificers of the ſayd towne neceſſary wares to the Dukes armie, at the ſieg of <hi>Chastilion,</hi> Into the ſayd Caſtell the Countrey had ſent their goods to bee ſafely kept.</p>
               <p>The ſayd Captayne <hi>Roux</hi> had in the Caſtell a priſoner named <hi>Cuſſel,</hi>

               <p>There went foorth ſixteene Souldiers, and foure countrey men, for the moſt part all catholikes: the caſtell contrary to promiſe beyng ranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, was ſet on fire and burned.</p>
               <p>The Duke <hi>de Mayne</hi> being at the ſiege of <hi>Puynormand,</hi> ſent <hi>Saiſſeual</hi> to the king, to aduertiſe him of his great conqueſt of <hi>Chaſtilion,</hi> but ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to haue money, and within few dayes after he followed his meſſenger to do his meſſage him ſelfe. From <hi>Puynormand,</hi> the reſt of that armye fel to pieces, and within a while became inuiſible. That army I ſay, that had boaſted within ſixe moneths to roote out of <hi>Guyenne</hi> &amp; <hi>Oaſtroyn,</hi> all them of the reformed religion, or elſe to force them to a perpetuall exile, without hauing any more liberty, not ſo much as to turne their forces toward their countrey.</p>
               <p>This valiant warryer had beſtowed a whole yeare, and waſted a mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of Franks, which the Prieſts had contributed toward that warre: he hath for his money the villages of <hi>Montignak, Beaulieu, Triles, Caſtets,</hi> which he bought with the Prieſtes money, Saint <hi>Bezile, Montſegure, Chaſtilion, Puynormand,</hi> which immediatly came agayne into the hands of them of the reformed religion, and were fortifyed ſtronger then euer they had béen. Now, if this great Dukes Chaplens will haue more warre &amp; conqueſtes at his handes, they muſt pay for it, or elſe let them goe againſt the heretikes themſelues, for he will goe home. Thus endeth the tragicall comedie of this Captaine.</p>
               <p>In October the cheefeſt of the reformed religion in the Iles of <hi>Maran,</hi> perceauing the diſorder which was in the gard of the caſtel of <hi>Portmaran,</hi>

which thing being granted vnto them, they demaunded the Lord <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſars</hi> of <hi>Montalambert,</hi> a valiant and expert Captaine, who had giuen a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1586.

The ſayd Lord <hi>Eſſars</hi> accepted it vnder the authority of the Prince, with 20.

               <p>But within few dayes after, the ſayd Lord of <hi>Eſſars</hi> began to vary with the inhabitants, who were of the religion for the moſt part. For the ſayd Lord hauing found the caſtell wholly vnfurniſhed of all houſhold and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary commodities, required that they would furniſh it both for him and his ſouldiers, and alſo that in caſe the ſayd caſtell ſhould be beſieged, they would repayre to it for the defence of the ſame, and alſo willed them to bring in their moueables.</p>
               <p>Then anſwered the ſayd Lord <hi>Eſſars,</hi> that with moueables euery one had furniſhed what they could, and that the beſt of their goods were tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to <hi>Rochel.</hi> As for to retyre within the Caſtell, they thought it not expedient, for if the enemie ſhould beſiege it, and beate it, they knew well by experience, that it was not defenſible.

This anſwer the L. <hi>Eſſars</hi> did greatly miſlyke, which miſliking continued vntil the Princes returne out of <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Rochel,</hi> who being aduertized thereof, ſendeth the L. <hi>Reſſeus,</hi> and an other, to be fully informed of all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> matter.

               <p>It is ſayd before, how the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> (after the diſſolution of his army at <hi>Solonne</hi> in <hi>Vendomoys)</hi> through great daungers and difficultyes, repayred to the Iland of <hi>Gerneſey,</hi> and from thence into <hi>England,</hi> where he was receaued in moſt princelyke ſort of that gracious great <hi>Elizabeth</hi> Queene of <hi>England.</hi>

               <p>During his ſoiorne there, many noblemen and gentlemen paſſed ouer the ſea into <hi>England,</hi> to accompany him home agayne, among whom was

               <p>The ſayd Prince arriued at <hi>Rochel</hi> with that trayne the 3. of January, about eight a clocke in the night.

               <p>The Prince being returned home ſo happely, ſoiorned not long at <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel,</hi> but within fewe dayes tooke his iourney to S. <hi>Ihan,</hi> to prouide for the neceſſarie affayres, and to muſter the companies which were or could bee gathered.</p>
               <p>Fewe dayes before the Lord <hi>Laual</hi> was gone foorth out of Saint <hi>Ihan,</hi> with ſome companies to beſiege the Caſtle of <hi>Tours:</hi> but they which were within ſtayed not the ordinance which was comming from Saint <hi>Jhan,</hi> but yéelded themſelues without any delay. The ſayd Caſtle was rendered into the hand of the Lord <hi>Caze,</hi> to whom it did belong.</p>
               <p>At that time, to wit, after the comming of the Prince to Saint <hi>Ihan,</hi> the Lords, Captaines and companies, began to order themſelues vnder the ſayd Prince in forme of an armie, where with about the 17. of January he began to beſiege the Caſtle of <hi>Dampierre,</hi> pertayning to the Marſhall of <hi>Bets,</hi> nigh the towne of S. <hi>Ihan,</hi> ſituated vpon the riuer <hi>Botonne,</hi> within the which was a popiſh garriſon: which through their inſolencie and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie roades vpon them of the religion, did drawe this ſtorme vppon their heads. The ſayd Caſtle being battered for certaine dayes, was ſurrendred about the 24. of Ianuary.</p>
               <p>There was found within that Caſtle great quantitie of corne and mooue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able goods, which the people of the countrey round about had carried in. It was hard to let the Souldiers from the pillage, conſidering that they had ſo long ſuffered inſinite miſeries after the breaking of the armie in <hi>Vendo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moys:</hi> for they which had reaſſembled themſelues in <hi>Poytow,</hi> had kept them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues within the fauour of the townes of S. <hi>Ihan,</hi> and others, which were holden by them of the religion.</p>
               <p>The companies of the Prince (after the taking of <hi>Dampierre)</hi> were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided into three parts, which went into thrée ſeuerall coaſts of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.

The Lord <hi>Ranques</hi> (with the fourth part of the companies) went to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Niort,</hi> and enterprized vppon the Caſtle of <hi>Saſſoy,</hi> and tooke it from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1587.

That caſtle by ſituation is very ſtrong: the garriſon did great iniuries to them of the religion about <hi>Rochel,</hi> Saint <hi>Jhan, Marans,</hi> other places and high wayes, by their ordinarie courſes. The Lord <hi>Ranques</hi> knowing the nature of the place, ſearched out the meanes to obtayne it: he accompanied him with nine or ten gentlemen and certaine reſolute Souldiers, to the number of two and twentie: he carried through the mariſh a little boate on a cart, wherewith he went through a channell which watereth the garden of the Caſtle. To this garden doth anſwer a gate of the ſayd Caſtle, through the which he thought to ſurpriſe the ſayd Caſtle. Notwithſtanding, the day before the taking of the ſame, the garriſon hauing intelligences of the purpoſe of the ſayd Lord <hi>Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques,</hi> by one of the reformed religion, who entertayned himſelfe with them of the garriſon; they ſtopped that gate with brick, dung, and other things which were at hand, and doubled their gards, and ſo thought to haue well prouided the ſurprizing of the ſayd place. Notwithſtanding their thoughts beguiled them: for the ſayd Lord <hi>Ranques</hi> following his enterprize, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied a petaird againſt that gate which iſſued out into the garden: the ſayd péece opened the gate and brake their rampier, and gaue the alarum to the gariſon: whereof part ranne to the great gate, other were ſurpriſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Caſtell and ſlayne, other leapt ouer the walles. They who had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyred to the great gate, yeelded themſelues with promiſe of their liues: which thing was alſo performed. The place was by the ſayd Lord <hi>Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques</hi> put in the keeping of Captayne <hi>Faueran</hi> and <hi>Vaunean,</hi> who within a while after being ſommoned by Captayne <hi>Merceur</hi> to render the ſame, and for not ſo doing, being threatned of the Canon, put the ſayd place in the hand of <hi>Malicorne</hi> gouernor of <hi>Niort.</hi>

               <p>The Prince aduertyzed, how this regiment of <hi>Tiercelyne</hi> had paſſed into that Iland, the Fryday before Eaſter, being the firſt of Aprill, he tooke his way to <hi>Marennes,</hi> nigh <hi>Browage,</hi> where he thought that the ſayd <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erceline</hi> was returned, and went all night to ſurpriſe him more eaſily: but finding them not, hee returned to <hi>Taillebourge,</hi> with the Lords <hi>Laual,</hi> and <hi>Boulay,</hi> and other Lords and Captaines who had accompanyed him.</p>

The 3. of Aprill being Eaſter day, the ſaid Prince had aduertiſement, that the ſaide <hi>Treceline,</hi> with his regiment, had repaſſed from <hi>Oleron,</hi> to <hi>Marennes,</hi> for to returne to <hi>Xainctes:</hi> vpon theſe intelligences, the ſaide <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1586.

After this ſkirmiſh, the Prince ſeeing that <hi>Treceline</hi> remoued not that day (for that it was Eaſter day, or otherwiſe) retyred for the ſecond time to <hi>Taillebourg,</hi> without dooing any thing elſe. <hi>Treceline</hi> was aduertiſed, that his returne was ſpied, but hee made no account of it, truſting in the force of his regiment, and reſolued (as hee ſaide) to fight againſt whome ſoeuer would let his way, as well in the field as in a ſtrong place.</p>
               <p>So the fourth day of April, being Eaſter monday, departing out of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rennes,</hi> he tooke his iourney toward <hi>Xainctes,</hi> marching in good order with countenance of men reſolute to fight, whereof the Prince being admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, about two a clock in the after noone ſpeedilie tooke his horſe, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with the Lorde <hi>Trimouille,</hi> his brother in law, the Lords <hi>Bowlay</hi> and <hi>Auantigny,</hi> to the number of 30. horſes, &amp; ſo many Harquebuſiers of his garde, and ſome other who could bee found at hand: with that ſmall number, he went the ready way to <hi>Xainctes,</hi> where he found the enemie in the ſelfe ſame place, where he had ſtayed for him the day before, which was not much more than one thouſand paces from the ſuburbe: he found them too farre paſſed toward the towne, and were couered with hedges and dit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, yet he ſet vpon the rereware of them, whereat the firſt he laied on the ground about 30. or 40. of the enemies: the reſt put themſelues in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell aray, being fauored with the hedges and high way.

The Enſigne taken, the Souldiours were quicklie put in diſorder and diſcomfited, although that they had been often ſupported, &amp; vpholden by them of the citie. There remained vpon the place about three ſkore; many were wounded, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Peſchays</hi> was taken, <hi>Tiercelin</hi> himſelfe was hurt in the arme.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Laual</hi> had three bretheren, whereof the Lord <hi>Taulay,</hi> a little before died of ſicknes at Saint <hi>Ihan:</hi> the Lord <hi>Sailly,</hi> his third brother in that ſkirmiſh was hurt in the head, whereof he died: the morrow after, the Lord <hi>Rieulx</hi> his other brother, alſo was wounded in the belly with a pike, whereof hee dyed the ſixte day of the ſame moneth.

               </p>
               <p>The King by letters and meſſengers, exhorted and willed him to quiet himſelfe, to ſee his Edict of pacification to be obſerued in his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement, ſhewed him that their cauſe is but one, that hee ſeeth the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of the ſayd Leaguers well enough, and truſteth that GOD ſhall make him able to repreſſe their madnes, proteſted that he had care of the ſaid K. of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> as of his own ſelfe, and held him as a deere brother, the true &amp; rightfull heire of his Crown, in caſe he ſhould die without iſſue.</p>

               <p>It is ſaid alſo how the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> before had forewarned the King to beware of ſuch aſſociation, ſhewing him the euil which would ſurely enſue, and at length certifieth the King that hee had admitted a higher power, a maſter and controuler ouer himſelfe, and that hee had weakned himſelfe, and ſtrengthened his enemies. Howe hee went to Saint <hi>Ihan de Cadeioux</hi> into <hi>Languedock,</hi> there to aduiſe of his affaires, and his friends, with the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> the Duke <hi>Monmorencie,</hi> and other Nobles, where they concluded vpon the defenſiue.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> returned into <hi>Gaſcoyne,</hi> kept himſelfe in ſilence, abiding all the iniuries that might be poſſible, the preparations, brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings, boaſtings, &amp; attempts of his enemies, euen to the great imminent danger of his perſon, before that he would take armes in hande.

               <p>And whereas he knew well, that if he had ioyned all his forces with the power of the Prince, and the Vicount <hi>Turenne,</hi> hee had been able to ſtop the way of the Duke <hi>de Maine,</hi> that he had not walked ſo long at his pleaſure as he did.

               <p>At length the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> determined to paſſe the riuer of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronne,</hi> to repaire into <hi>Poytow,</hi> to viſit the places of his gouernement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Februrie"/> the riuer of <hi>Loyre,</hi> and being returned from <hi>Montauban</hi> into <hi>Gaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coyne,</hi> the Marſhal <hi>Matignon</hi> had beſieged <hi>Caſtets,</hi> a Caſtel ſituated vpon the riuer <hi>Garonne,</hi> pertayning to the Lord <hi>Fabas,</hi> about the moneth of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruarie.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> hauing knowledge thereof, accompanied with two or three hundred horſes, and eighteene hundred Harquebuſiers, did raiſe the ſiege, and dined in the ſaide Caſtle that day, in witnes that he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed his purpoſe for that time.</p>
               <p>The K. of <hi>Nauarre</hi> from thence ſent al his companies to gariſons, and tooke his way to <hi>Bearne,</hi> to ſee the Ladie his ſiſter, and to take order for all neceſſarie things, concerning the ſecuritie and preſeruation of the townes and countrey.</p>

               <p>The King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> came the morrow after to Saynt <hi>Foy,</hi> which is a towne vppon <hi>Dordonne.</hi> The Lord <hi>Roque</hi> alſo with all them which had followed him, aryued there about two houres after.

Theſe bee two townes ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated vppon <hi>Dordonne: Bergerak</hi> is great and rich: Saynt <hi>Foy</hi> is leſſer a great deale, yet very riche, becauſe of the traffike vpon the ſayd riuer: S. <hi>Foy</hi> is beneath <hi>Bergerak</hi> three leagus: <hi>Chaſtilion</hi> beneath Saint <hi>Foy</hi> three leagues, and aboue <hi>Liborne,</hi> a great, ſtrong, and rich towne about three leagus of. <hi>Bergerak</hi> and Saynt <hi>Foy</hi> receaued the Goſpel aboue fifty years ago by the man of God <hi>Edmond Lauoy,</hi> who ſuffered at <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> for the teſtimony of Chriſt. Theſe two townes haue alwayes euer ſince perſiſted in the confeſſion of the Goſpell. in theſe 2. towns the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> remayned (as is aboue ſayd) a whole moneth, expreſſely to ſee the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of his enemies. All that while his enemies were within 3. leagues of him, hee went dayly to hunting, and none of his enemyes that euer durſt ſhew their faces: which thing did ſhew euidently, that <hi>de Mayne</hi> had ſo litle corage in him, that hee durſt not let him to take his pleaſures when he was willing ſo to do, much leſſe to execute his enterpriſes, and proued for wayghty and neceſſary affayres.</p>
               <p>It is ſayd before, how that by the aduiſe of <hi>de Mayne, Guyze</hi> came to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> to require helpe for his brother. For as a conſcience guylty of gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous crimes is alwayes timorous, and ſuſpecteth all things: ſo the woorm of the conſcience gnawed theſe men, and feared them ſo, that hee appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended Gods iuſtice: and ſuppoſed that all them of the reformed religion in <hi>France</hi> (out of hand) would oppreſſe the Duke <hi>de Mayne</hi> his Brother.</p>
               <p>Therefore hee perſwaded the king to diuert theyr forces, and to aſſault them in all quarters of the Realme. Whereupon dyuers armies were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for diuers countries, and namely the Marſhall <hi>Biron</hi> was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for <hi>Guyenne.</hi>
               </p>

did greatly haſt the voyage of the ſayd Marſhall <hi>Biron.</hi> The inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitantes of <hi>Niort</hi> hauing ſold themſelues to the Leaguers to worke ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1586.

               <p>The king of <hi>Nauarre</hi> vnderſtanding of theſe new preparations, and knowing, yea ſeeing with his eies that the moſt miſerable vilages of <hi>Guy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enne</hi> were good ynough to occupy that army, and that the tyme of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Aprill"/> diſſipation was at hand, hauing prouided for the principall places ſufficiently, and vnderſtanding of the readines of the army, which was to be lead by the Marſhal <hi>Biron,</hi> the ſaid king of <hi>Nauarre</hi> would rather ſhew a proofe of his valour and courage in oppoſing himſelfe to that valiant, old, and experienced Captayne, then to ſeeme to ſtriue with that effeminate, and ſlauiſh army.</p>
               <p>Therefore departing from Saynt <hi>Foy</hi> in the end of Aprill, and paſſing through <hi>Perigord, Engomoys, Poytow,</hi> &amp; <hi>Landimoys,</hi> went to viſit the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his gouernement vpon the riuer of <hi>Loyre.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whileſt the army for <hi>Guyenne</hi> is a preparing, and the king of <hi>Nauarre</hi> maketh his progreſſe into <hi>Poytow,</hi> and the townes vpon <hi>Loyre,</hi> the King vnderſtanding, that in the execution of the edict of October, and of the declaration thereof, giuen in December laſt, touching the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing on the goods of them of the religion: and others, which did beare arms againſt the League, many creditors &amp; others which pretended right in the goods, made claime to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſo that the officers could haue no gayne there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to the kings vſe and aduantage.

               <p>And for aſmuch as ſome were returned home from the countries, where <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Maye"/> they had rep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

During the preparations of this warre, the Pirats of <hi>Browage</hi> with theyr courſes did greatly hinder the traffike vpon the Sea, which cauſed them of <hi>Rochel</hi> to barre their hauen, in ſinking old ſhips in the mouth of the riuer, repleniſhed with great ſtones for to make them ſinke in the bottome of the water.</p>
               <p>For the performance of this, the Rochellers prepared a nauy of twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:8966:68"/>
ſhips well furniſhed, three Galiots, with other ſmall veſſels to the num<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ber of 35. or 40. in all. Ouer this army commaunded the Lord Saynt <hi>Gelays,</hi> aſſiſted with Captayne <hi>Gardeleau:</hi> and a number alſo of Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1586.

               </p>
               <p>The Lord Saynt <hi>Luke</hi> vppon the aduertizement which he receaued of this enterprize, with all diligence prepared himſelfe, and would haue ſtayed all the Galleyes which he had before receaued from <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> but few remayned there: notwithſtanding hee made a Fort vpon the banke nigh the place where they would barre the ſayd hauen: which thing profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him a little, for in the keeping of the ſame hee loſt a great number of men.</p>
               <p>Whileſt this was a dooing at <hi>Browage,</hi> the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> returned from <hi>Poytow,</hi> and fro the Coaſt of <hi>Loyre,</hi> and entered into <hi>Rochel</hi> the laſt day of May (being the Lords day) with a marueilous reioy ſing of al men, which receaued much comfort of his preſence there: for the ſayd King had alwayes no leſſe vertuouſly than happely oppoſed himſelfe to all the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts and endeuours of all the armies of the enemies, which had béen ſent againſt them.</p>
               <p>The ſame day the ſayd King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> embarked himſelfe, to goe to viſit the Nauie which was before <hi>Browage,</hi> where he ſoiorned ſome dayes.</p>
               <p>In the meane while there had arriued certayne ſhippes to the Lord S. <hi>Luke</hi> gouernour of <hi>Browage,</hi> who with them went about to let that enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize; but all was in vayne: ſo that without any great loſſe, all the ſhips appoynted for that exployt, were brought in and ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

So the chanell by theſe means was barred in ſuch a ſort, as the Hauen hath béen in a manner rendered vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable. Notwithſtanding that, the Lord S. <hi>Luke</hi> hath beſtowed much labour to open it, and at the charges of the inhabitants of the Ilands, he hath drawne out foure or fiue veſſels. Yet is that Hauen alwayes ſuſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto ſhips, and they néede to ſet markes to the ſhips that will enter in, leaſt they take hurt.</p>
               <p>This being done, the Nauie returned to <hi>Rochel,</hi> without any loſſe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of one Captayne named <hi>Mercur,</hi> and fewe Souldiers which were taken in the ſkirmiſhes that were made at the Fort aboue mentioned.</p>
               <p>About the fourth of Iune, the King being returned to <hi>Rochel</hi> with this Nauie, and vnderſtanding that the Marſhall <hi>Byron</hi> with this armie ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Iune"/> and that <hi>Luſignen, Mele</hi> and <hi>Chizay</hi> (Townes not defenſible) had yéelded themſelues, tooke his iourney to <hi>Marans,</hi> to conſider the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces whether théy were able to make head againſt that armie.</p>
               <p>The armie lead by the Marſhall <hi>Byron</hi> did conſiſt of twelue hundred horſemen, and foure thouſand footemen with a conuenient furniture. This armie was very ſmall; the cauſe was, that the King (at the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

of the Leaguers) had deuided his forces into ſundrie armies for ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie Prouinces, to diuert the forces of them of the religion from the Duke <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1586. Iune"/>

               <p>The King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> hauing well viewed the Forts of the Iles of <hi>Maran,</hi> concluded to defend the places agaynſt that armie,</p>
               <p>The 7. day of Iune came two ſorts of deputies appoynted to require of the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> two contrary things: namely, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

On the other ſide, the Gentlemen of <hi>Annix</hi> required him not to doo ſo, for as much as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts would take occaſion to doo the like to their houſes. The King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarre</hi> anſwered to them both, that thereupon he would take aduiſe.</p>
               <p>Whileſt theſe things were a dooing, the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> had aduertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that the Duke <hi>de Mayne</hi> diſtreſſed <hi>Chastilion:</hi> whereupon he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled as great a companie of horſemen as he could, and with the Prince determined to reſcue that place: which he could not bring to paſſe, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the aduancing of <hi>Byron</hi> and his armie. For the armie of <hi>Byron</hi> was alreadie aduanced to <hi>Niort,</hi> and hauing no néerer place than <hi>Maran</hi> to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault, made his reckoning not to beſiege it, but onely to fright the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants and about fiftie ſouldiers, which he knewe to be lodged in the forts: and in the greater of the ſayd forts there was not aboue nine or ten Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers; the ſayd forts being very ill furniſhed, which made him beléeue that ſuch a ſmall companie would not withſtand him, but ſurrender the ſayd forts.</p>
               <p>The feare indéede was great among many, whereof ſome of them had alreadie retyred to <hi>Rochel.</hi> But the Lord <hi>Iarry</hi> (gouernour of the place) and his Souldiers (with ſome of the inhabitants) tooke courage: many did deſpayre of the ſuccour of the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> whom they thought to haue paſſed into <hi>Gaſcoyne.</hi> They reſolued notwithſtanding to hold againſt that armie. And on the monday the 7. of Iune at night, they ſent meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to <hi>Rochel,</hi> to demaund ſuccour both of men and munition of warre, and of certaine péeces. They of <hi>Rochel</hi> anſwered, that they could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniently ſpare men; as for munition and peeces they would willingly let them haue, ſo that they might haue ſecuritie to be payed the price that it coſt them.</p>
               <p>This refuſall of men did ſo feare the inhabitants, that euen that night many did retyre, and carried away the reſt of their goods.</p>
               <p>But on the Wedneſday morning about foure of the clocke arriued from the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> two Gentlemen, to wit, the Lord <hi>Fouqueroles,</hi> and <hi>Valiere,</hi> whom he had ſent in great diligence: they calling the gouernour, the Miniſter of the place, and ſome of the inhabitants, aſſured them that the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> was comming in great diligence for to ſuccour them,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:8966:69"/>
and that he would arriue euen the ſame day: and after they had reſted a while, the ſayd Lords went to view the Holds and entrings into the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, and ſo likewiſe the day following. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1586 Iune"/>
               </p>
               <p>The 12. day of Iune, the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> came with fewe in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, but his troupes followed him apace.</p>
               <p>The 13. 14. and 15. dayes of that moneth, there entered braue compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Souldiers, as they of the Lords <hi>Puelles, Granuile, Drakuille</hi> and S. <hi>Foy,</hi> Normands. There entered alſo <hi>Barache,</hi> the regiment of <hi>Sorlus,</hi> the Lord of <hi>Neufuy,</hi> vnder fiue Enſignes, for the moſt part Perigordins and Limoſins, yet very well trained in Military Diſcipline. All theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies were placed in the forts by the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> namely, the Lord <hi>Puelles</hi> was in the <hi>Bastile, Drakuille</hi> in <hi>Beauregard, Barache</hi> at <hi>Barnay, Granuile</hi> with Saint <hi>Foy,</hi> were put in the <hi>Brune,</hi> and <hi>Repentne</hi> on the way to <hi>Rochel:</hi> Captaine <hi>Plaune</hi> with his companie of <hi>Poytiuines,</hi> was placed at <hi>Poyneuf,</hi> Captaine Saint <hi>Ihan</hi> at <hi>Clouſie,</hi> Captaine <hi>Treille</hi> in <hi>Brault:</hi> there was a company of <hi>Rochellers,</hi> few in number, but men reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute vnder Captaine <hi>Mot,</hi> they were put to keepe the entrey of the mill in the Marſh.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Iarrie</hi> gouernour of <hi>Mans,</hi> vndertooke to keepe the Forts <hi>Paulee, Allowete,</hi> and <hi>Botsblauk,</hi> with his companie, and ſome of the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants. The King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> commaunded all to obey the Lord <hi>Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quereles,</hi> who ſhewed a marueilous care and diligence in the ſame ſiege.</p>
               <p>The 10. day of Iulie, the Marſhall <hi>Byron</hi> with a companie of horſes, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Iulie"/> came himſelfe to view the <hi>Bastile,</hi> but approaching a little too nigh, he was ſaluted out of ſome ſmall forts, which the Lorde <hi>Puelles</hi> had placed vpon the high way; hee had his thumb and ſome other fingers taken off with a ſhot; the ſame ſhot did greatly (as it was reported) hurt a Gentleman, who was by him.</p>
               <p>All that weeke, the enemie did none other thing, but aduaunced him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe toward the <hi>Bastile,</hi> ſet his gabions nigh the farme of <hi>Angle,</hi> there to place three pieces to batter the fort of <hi>Bastile.</hi> In the mean time, the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> did ſhew a wonderful diligence, as wel in fortifying the Iland, as in bringing companies to make head to the enemie at euerie comming in, and alſo in prouiding of victuals and munition of warre, as well out of <hi>Rochel,</hi> as out of the Ile of <hi>Rhe,</hi> and out of <hi>Luſſon,</hi> whence hee brought great ſtoare of corne, meale and wine. He had a great ſhip out of the Ile of <hi>Rhe,</hi> well furniſhed, hauing two great pieces before, to defend the Fort <hi>Paulce,</hi> he had alſo ſeauen great pieces caried from <hi>Rochel,</hi> which were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided in the Forts, to wit, one in the <hi>Brune,</hi> two in the <hi>Bastile,</hi> one at <hi>Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regarde,</hi> two at <hi>Paulce,</hi> and two remained at the Caſtell.</p>
               <p>The 22. of Iuly, was ſeene that the enemie paſſed through the Marſhes of <hi>Beauregard,</hi> and comming foorth out of a little Iland named <hi>Cigogne,</hi>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:8966:69"/>
began to ſet vp a fort in the middle of the Marſhes, diſtant from the firme land about fiue hundred paces, on the other ſide, our men made a trench and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1586. Iulie"/> a rampier of earth vpon the end of the Marſh, of the length of fiue hundred paces, flanking the ſame with little Forts and Baſtions. On the other ſide the enemie ſet vp foure other forts, ſomewhat more aduaunced than the firſt, and from them did ſhoote ouer the reeds at all aduenture, without doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any hurt, ſauing that the third day after they hurt a Souldiour on the foote, as he went downe to the Trenches. The next day after, they kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led another as he was playing at cardes vpon the ſide of the Trenches, the which being reported by the Miniſter, and admoniſhed to goe to publique praiers, which were appoynted to be made at the Fort of the Lord <hi>Drakuil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le,</hi> he regarded it not, ſo that as the miniſter returned from praiers, the ſaid Souldier was ſhot through with a muſket, and preſentlie departed, before that the Miniſter had any time to admoniſh and comfort him. The ſame day, the enemie with great diligence ſet vp a great fort, within ſixe ſcore paces of our trenches, it was made with great pieces of timber, fagots and earth, and hogſheads filled with earth, which were diſpoſed by ſeauen, ſet one againſt another; that fort might be of 30. foot ſquare, and 15. in heigt, and for to bring all the ſtuffe from the Iland <hi>Cagogne,</hi> they cauſed the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Mariſhes to riſe aboue a foote in heigt, by the meanes of ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſluſes and mills, about <hi>Fontenay</hi> and <hi>Niort.</hi> This thing our men did helpe alſo, for becauſe of the great heate, they feared that the water would drie too faſt, and ſo giue too eaſie acceſſe to the enemie through the Marſh, for they ſtopped the ſluces below nigh the ſea, therefore the water courſe being opened aboue, and ſtopped beneath, did riſe in a ſhort ſpace. By this meanes the enemie had opportunitie to bring a very great Culue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, with other ſmall pieces, wherewith they began to ſhoote vppon our men, &amp; vpon the houſe of <hi>Beauregard</hi> the laſt day of Iuly, about two a clock, without dooing any hurt to any man.</p>
               <p>This battering, notwithſtanding did amaze a great many, becauſe they neuer thought that they would haue brought ſuch pieces; for it was bruted, and euen the Papiſts had giuen out, that the enemie would raiſe the ſiege: but by this it appeared, that he meant in good earneſt.</p>
               <p>For all the great diligence and care of the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> in proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for victuals, there was ſo many mouthes who liued of the ſtoare, that they who did beſt ſeruice, oftentimes dined worſt. For during the ſpace of eight or ten dayes, they had not in a day but one or two loaues of Barley bread; for other corne was not ripe as yet in that countrey, which cauſed that ſcarſitie. There were yet two diſcommodities which vrged them greatly; the one was an extreame heate, which continued ten weekes and more: the other <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

               <p>Some dayes before, the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> had taken order, that one of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1586. Iuly"/> the Galiots of <hi>Rochel</hi> came within the hauen of <hi>Marans,</hi> with a long Culuerine, bearing the armes of <hi>Britayne,</hi> which in the former warres, the Rochelers had taken out of the Caſtell of <hi>Marans,</hi> which afterward was called <hi>Chaſsebiron.</hi> That euening it was had out of the Galiot, and carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with horſes &amp; men halfe the way to <hi>Beauregard,</hi> but there it was ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne, and one of the wheeles broaken: from thence it was drawne vpon rowles, and being placed againſt the fort of the enemie, in ſuch ſort as it could not bee indomaged, did them good ſeruice. For the 2. of Auguſt, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſixe a clock in the morning, the enemie brought downe the water from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Auguſt"/> 
                  <hi>Niort,</hi> a double Cannon vpon two boates, and with them began to ſhoote againſt the Fort <hi>Paulee.</hi> There they did no other hurt, but ſhooting with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a ſhort piece of yron, they did breake it about a foote, and the pieces ſtroake off the arme of the Gunner, and did hurt two Souldious; they hurt alſo a Souldiour of the Ship, who did ſhew great endeuour to ſhoote at the enemie, with a number of Harquebuſes and Muſkets.</p>
               <p>And below the fort <hi>Paulee,</hi> the Lord <hi>Iarry</hi> with his harquebuſiers, but ſpecially with the long fowling pieces of the inhabitantes of <hi>Maran,</hi> who did inceſſantly ſhoote vpon the boates, and alſo into the coppes nigh the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, did ſo moleſt the enemy, that about nine a clocke they were enforced to forſake their boats, and theyr double Canon, which remayned in the midle of the Riuer, vntill that hauing tyed the beats with coardes, they drew them away vp the riuer, and did no other thing therewith: for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they might haue endomaged the fort by a long battering, yet had it béen impoſſible vnto them to approach to it to ſeaze vpon, conſidering that the riuer was ſtaked thicke, and the ſhot fell vppon them as thicke, if they diſcouered themſelues neuer ſo litle, ſo they were not ſuffered to appeare within their reache. While they drew theyr boats, there was a raſh fellow to occupy our harquebuziers, which did diſcouer himſelfe armed a great while in the ſight of our men, playing with his two hand ſword: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they ſhot an infinit number of pellets at him, yet was he not hit but of two, and was very litle hurt, as it was afterward reported.</p>
               <p>The third of Auguſt there was a great alarum geuen at the trenches of <hi>Beauregard,</hi> for the enemy made a countenance to aduance forward vpon vs.</p>
               <p>At midnight wee ſet vpon the towers of the caſtell with great lanterns of light, becauſe that the enemie had great fires in all their watches, and a mighty fire vpon the vaultes of S. <hi>Ihan</hi> of <hi>Lauerſay</hi> nigh the lodging of the Marſhall <hi>Biron,</hi> half a league off from <hi>Baſtile.</hi> At that tyme was there meanes made for the agreement betweene the king of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> and the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:8966:70"/>
Marſhall <hi>Biron</hi> generall af the Popiſh army, which was concluded vpon the fifth day of the ſame Auguſt. So that the night following the enemy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1586.

The compoſition was very honorable, and to the great aduantage of the king of <hi>Nauarre:</hi> for it was firſt agreed, that the Marſhall <hi>Biron</hi> ſhould lead away his army beyond the riuer, without attempting vppon <hi>Tonnay Charante,</hi> a place very weake, which hee di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, that <hi>Marans</hi> ſhould remayne free for the traffike.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that the king of <hi>Nauarre</hi> ſhould haue a Gentleman of his in the caſte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l, with certayne number of ſouldiers to hold the inhabitantes of both religions in the ſame liberty which they had before the warre. This agreement they of <hi>Fontenay</hi> and <hi>Niort</hi> would not hold, and neuer ceaſed to make warre vntill that they were well puniſhed: for wicked robbers did continually iſſue out of <hi>Fontenay, Maillezayes</hi> &amp; <hi>Niort,</hi> hauing for their Captayne a certayne Maſſe Prieſt, named Sir <hi>Merye,</hi> pariſh Prieſt of <hi>Ronde,</hi> who did dayly robbe Marchants and trauellers of their goods, and often times of their liues, vntill they were reduced vnder the handes of the king of <hi>Nauarre.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſeuenth of the ſame moneth, the king of <hi>Nauarre</hi> came from <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel,</hi> when it was very late, entered the Iles of <hi>Maran,</hi> by the fort <hi>Brune,</hi> and from thence to the <hi>Baſtile,</hi> viewed all the fortes and trenches on that ſide: and about ten in the night did ſuppe at the ſigne of the Moone.</p>
               <p>The eight day hee deuided his companies, ſending ſome into <hi>Poytow,</hi> other into <hi>Annis</hi> to refreſh themſelues, whileſt the L. <hi>Byron</hi> lead his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my into <hi>Xainctonge:</hi> ſo that armie began to bee broken agaynſt Reeds and Ruſhes of <hi>Marans,</hi> doing afterward nothing: but within a while after by litle and litle it was ſcattered and reduced to nothing.</p>
               <p>The Papiſtes ſpake diuerſly according to their paſſion, as though this armie had not done what they might haue done. But the truth is, that the king of <hi>Nauarre</hi> had prouided ſuch a good order within the Iland, and that there was ſuch a number of men of valour, that the Lord <hi>Biron</hi> could not do otherwiſe then he did, except he would haue thruſt his me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter without endomaging much his enemy.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the mariſhes which at that tyme were wont to bee drye, were yet full of water euen a foot high, for the cauſes aboue recited.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the men of warre haue made fortes at euery entrance into the Iland, furniſhed with good and reſolued men: for they were about one hundred of braue and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> gentlemen, making about two hundred good horſes, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>le to oppoſe themſelues agaynſt the enemy, if he had attempted
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:8966:71"/>
to enter. Alſo the enemyes had to goe aboue fifteene hundred paces in the Marſh, not aboue fiue in a ranke, all diſcouered to our men who were in the forts. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1586. Auguſt"/>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, the Mariſh was full of ſteppes, which the Cattell made in winter: ſo that if the horſemen had waded, the one foote had ſoonke very deepe, and the other would haue ſtayed vppon the firme ground, with a great number of Galthrops, which were caſt in diuers places. Such was the ſtate of <hi>Maran,</hi> when the compoſition was made. The king of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarre</hi> left the Lord <hi>Iarry</hi> gouernor there as before, with charge to warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt no man if they ſhould not warre agaynſt him.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Nemours</hi> (whom the King had ſent thither to commaund o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the men of armes) ſtayed not there long: for hee was commaunded by the king of <hi>Nauarre</hi> to retyre in <hi>Poytow,</hi> and after went to <hi>Bruant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Few dayes after the diſtributing of the companies out of <hi>Marans,</hi> cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne <hi>Lommeau</hi> diſcouered the money of the tributes &amp; Impoſt of <hi>Poytow,</hi> conducted toward <hi>Loyre</hi> by certayne Albaneſes: and ſome gentlemen with Popiſh ſouldiers of the countrey, whom they ſet vpon: but they ſaued them ſelues in a Priory. Not farre from thence he compaſſed them immediatly with certayne companies.</p>
               <p>The king of <hi>Nauarre</hi> being aduertiſed thereof at <hi>Rochel,</hi> departed ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, and cauſed the great Culuerine of <hi>Marans</hi> to bee brought before the Priory, which was ſtrong without canon: they within yeelded themſelues by compoſition, which was, that they ſhould goe away ſafe, leauing behind them ſix thouſand crownes, which was the charge of their conuoy.</p>
               <p>As the king of <hi>Nauarre</hi> vſed a wonderfull diligence in going thether, ſo was his diligence no leſſe in retyring thence, and commaunded all the companyes to do the like, knowing well that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> enemie (which was yet at <hi>Morye,</hi> and about <hi>Fontenay</hi> with his armie) would not faile to ſet on him; which thing did happen. But the ſayd king of <hi>Nauarre</hi> had already repaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the fort of <hi>Brault,</hi> which thing all his companies did not, for many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining at <hi>Luſſon</hi> to refreſh themſelues, and to fare French-like, were charged and put to flight, ſome were ſlaine, ſome taken priſoners, moſt of them ſaued them ſelues, leauing behind them their ſtuffe and baggage, and among them captayne <hi>Lommeau.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is ſayd before, that by the aduiſe of the Duke of <hi>Guyze,</hi> diuers ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies were appoynted for diuers prouinces, and namely the Duke <hi>Ioyeuſe</hi> for <hi>Languedock,</hi> where he entering with a power tooke the Cities of <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deue</hi> and Saint <hi>Ponce:</hi> hée tooke alſo <hi>Monteſquion:</hi> but <hi>Marueiolx</hi> hee tooke by treaſon. In all theſe places he committed incredible cruelties, and ſuch as it were needfull to find out new wordes to deſcribe them. But as God is a iuſt reuenger of wronges, ſo did he not ſuffer theſe crueltyes long vnpuniſhed, but ſhewed tokens that his iuſtice is neither fayned nor idle,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:8966:71"/>
nor his hand ſhortned in puniſhing ſuch inſolent Tyrants: For after di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers and manifold exceſſes and iniuries done in the countrey, he beſieged the <hi>mas Saint Puelles,</hi> the weakeſt, moſt miſerable, and leaſt defenſible of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1580. Auguſt"/> all the places of <hi>Loragoys:</hi> there was he ſo ſhamefully beaten &amp; put back, that after they had ſlaine him thirty Captaines, and fiue hundred Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuſieres, they ſcattered his regiments, and ſo leauing his credit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde him cracked among men of valour, was faine to returne home as well as he could, well chaſtized, to tell newes of his good ſpeede to his Maſter.</p>
               <p>Shortly after, the Nobilitie of <hi>Languedock</hi> aduiſed better by the proud and inſolent outragiouſnes of the man and of his companies, and taught by the execution of Gods iuſtice vpon that rabble of ſauage robbers, aſſembled the ſtates of that prouince, at <hi>Caſtelnawdarry,</hi> where they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded neuer to meddle anie more with the leaguers, neither to proceede any more by the way of warre and vyolence agaynſt them of the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
               <p>It is ſayd before how the Duke <hi>d'Eſpernon</hi> was appointed for <hi>Daulphine</hi> and <hi>Prouance,</hi> and the ſonne of <hi>Ioyeuſe</hi> for <hi>Auuergne.</hi> The Lord <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernon</hi> therefore entring into <hi>Daulphine</hi> with his power, had better ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe: for firſt he tooke <hi>Valance, Tallard,</hi> and <hi>Guileſlie</hi> from the league, and reduced them to the Kings obedience. He tooke alſo many townes from them of the Religion, as <hi>Sorges</hi> and others: hee was more moderate and voyde of crueltie and ſauagenes, yet at length ſeeing that as he had taken one place he left andther, and that warre was an endleſſe thing there, and that with long toyle of warre, and lack of money, his army was ſcattered, (as at length it went inuiſible) leauing his brother the Lord <hi>Valete</hi> there with ſuch forces as he had left, to doe what he were able: ſo he went to the King againe (and not without cauſe) conſidering he was one of his moſt faithfulleſt about his perſon.</p>
               <p>The young <hi>Ioyeuſe</hi> in <hi>Auuergne</hi> walked at liberty, tooke his pleaſures, ſpent the Kings money francklie, and when that was done, for lacke of more, returnd from whence he came as wiſe as when he went out.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee that within the compaſſe of a yeare, 6. armies haue beene ſent (with great preparation of all neceſſarie things) into ſeuerall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces, to warre againſt heauen and earth, and to oppoſe themſelues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all that is good and godly, and how they are all fallen to pieces, as though they had been ſmitten downe by the hand of the God of armies, as the <hi>Lapithes</hi> and <hi>Centaures</hi> are reported by the Poets.</p>
               <p>During theſe lamentable tempeſts, the which did ſo toſſe <hi>France</hi> with theſe ſixe armyes in diuers prouinces: The Princes and certaine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="October"/> cities in <hi>Germanie</hi> moued with compaſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, pittying the miſerable ſubuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and ranſaking of <hi>France</hi> their next neighbours: ſent an Ambaſſage

               <p>Firſt, they offer the commendations and ſeruices of their Princes and commonwealths vnto him.</p>

               <p>Thirdly, that they vnderſtand that hee had beene enforced, contrary to his godly intention, to reuoke the ſaid edict of peace, and by way of armes to perſecute his moſt faithfull ſubiects, euen the chiefeſt of the Princes of his blood, which thing they would hardly haue beleeued, if it had not bee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Fourthly, proteſting of the good affection of their Princes and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealths toward his Maieſtie, they doo in their names in moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wiſe beſeech him, that conſidering into what pitifull ſtate <hi>France</hi> had beene reduced by the former warres, and the good benefites which haue enſued the laſt peace: he wil not be induced by the perſwaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the Pope, to bring in againe blood ſhed, hatred of the Crowne of <hi>France,</hi> loſſe of ſo many Princes, Lords, and Nobilitie, and of ſo many his faythfull ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, which haue done to h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Fiftly, wheras he had ſhewed by his declaration, that the edict of peace was made by ripe deliberation and counſell, and publiſhed with all ſole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities requiſite thereunto, and that the ſayd edict was ſworn by his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of happy memory, Duke of <hi>Alançon,</hi> by the Princes and Lordes, in lifting vp their handes to heauen, and that hee himſelfe would haue that peace to be called his peace, which he made (as he ſaid) voluntarily, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

any compulſion, &amp; for that would haue it kept inuiolable, there was no reaſon why the benefites of that peace ſhould bee cut off, by rayſing warre <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1586.

Laſt of all, they doo ſhewe that there will enſue of the reuoking of this edict of peace, a moſt certaine and aſſured ſubuerſion of the ſtate and Crowne of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And by the way of concluſion, they beſeech his Maieſtie, that conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the reaſons by them ſhewed, &amp; taking ſome pitie of his poore Realme, it may pleaſe him to reiect the perſwaſions of the Pope and Leaguers, and to preſerue the edict of peace: offering vnto him in the names of their Princes and Commonwealths, that if there bee any meanes in them that may further a good peace, and reſtabliſh his eſtate, his Maieſtie ſhall vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand how they are affectionate to procure all things which pertaine to his honour and greatnes: and if it pleaſeth him, they will employ all their faithfull ſeruice in the aſſuring of his dignitie and royall Crowne, and to the benefite of all Chriſtendome, but ſpecially to ſuppreſſe this warre, whereunto (in their iudgement) he had béen enforced.</p>
               <p>Hauing made an ende of their ambaſſage, they deliuered him their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions both in Dutch and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>. The King giueth anſwere the 11. of October, but ſuch an anſwere as he ſeemed rather to be offended with them for their duetie and good will of their Princes &amp; Commonwealths, than to be mooued to any moderate counſell.</p>
               <p>It is ſayd before, that in Aprill of this yere 1586. the King made great preparation of warre in prouiding fiue armies all at once: at which time alſo they made a motion for peace vnto the King of <hi>Nauarre.</hi> By this it was an eaſie thing to iudge, that they who diſpoſed themſelues to warre ſo furiouſly, could not bee brought to condeſcend to any moderate counſell or reaſonable peace.</p>
               <p>But whileſt al theſe armies were readie, and marching to doo ſome great exployts, and to inuade the Prouinces (whereunto they of the reformed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion had retyred and were ſtrong) the <hi>Q Mother</hi> alſo marched toward <hi>Guienne,</hi> in hope to obtayne a greater victorie in aſſaulting the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> with a parley, than al thoſe armies with force. For ſhe tooke with her out of the ſtoare of Italian trickes, temptation, diſuniting and weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. For firſt ſhe will trie the tricke of Sathan in the 4. of <hi>Mathew,</hi> when he tempting Chriſt proffered him all the kingdomes of the earth: So ſhée thought to win this godly and noble Prince, in ſhewing him, that if he would forſake the Sonne of God, he ſhould be declared the right heire of the Crowne, in caſe the King ſhould deceaſe without iſſue: otherwiſe it would be impoſſible to him to attayne vnto that Crowne, conſidering the great ſtrength of the Catholikes, and how eagerly they are bent agaynſt the reformed religion.</p>
               <p>If ſhe heareth the ſame anſwere of him, which Sathan heard of Chriſt,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:8966:73"/>
then will ſhe take the ſecond weapon of her warre in hand, which is Diſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niting: for if the ſayd King will not conſent (vpon the proffer of peace) to aboliſh the exercize of the reformed religion, then ſhe will render him odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1586. Octob."/> with infamous Libels throughout <hi>France,</hi> both to them of the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med religion, and alſo to the Catholikes; for both were deſitous of peace: ſo ſhe imagineth, that by theſe meanes ſhe might diſunite them from the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> laying to his charge, that it reſted but in him that <hi>France</hi> was not at reſt.</p>
               <p>If this would not ſerue neither, then ſhe thought ſure that the third would doo the feate; which was to abuſe the true intentions of the ſayd King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> that holding him long about the hope of peace, and whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt he ſhould labour about it, he might be ſurprized by ſome poynt of Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian valour: and if not, his partakers would bee ſo weakened in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces, with theſe armies, that either he would not be able hereafter to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend himſelfe, or withſtand his enemies: or els that hee would bee inforced by this weakning, to accept at their hands a moſt diſaduantagious peace.</p>
               <p>And to begin withall, ſhe ſendeth to the Lords <hi>Monpenſier</hi> and <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morency,</hi> willing them to diſpoſe the heart of the ſayd King to peace (as ſhe ſayd): which thing was diuerſly taken. For the Leaguers feared the authoritie of the Prince <hi>Monpenſier,</hi> miſtruſting that by theſe meanes the <hi>Queene</hi> vnawares would vnite him to the head of his houſe. They of the religion feared his facilitie, that he was made a meane for peace, leaſt hée ſhould ioyne himſelfe to the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> in this quarrell and warre, (raiſed by the Leaguers) to deſtroy the houſe of <hi>Bourbon:</hi> ſo that by one thing both parts tooke occaſion to diſtruſt this meſſage.</p>
               <p>Aſſoone as the negotiation of peace began, the practizes of the Leaguers began alſo to interrupt the peace, which they greatly feared. For after the meſſage of theſe two Lords, the Abbot of <hi>Gadaigne</hi> was ſent to the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> (for no Tragedie can be wel played without a Prieſt) who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wel entertayned at <hi>Rochel</hi> by the ſayd King, euery man began to hope well of that thing which was ſo greatly deſired.</p>
               <p>But when the <hi>Q. Mother</hi> came to <hi>Cheuonceau,</hi> a towne lying vpon the riuer <hi>Chere,</hi> which falleth in <hi>Loyre</hi> beneath <hi>Tours,</hi> all this hope vaniſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way like a lightming. For then the hatred and deceitfull meaning of the <hi>Q. Mother</hi> was diſcouered, which had lien hid vnder thoſe courteous meſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. For the Abbot of <hi>Gadaigne</hi> was ſent to <hi>Browage,</hi> there to play <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> part (if he could): but his going thether was much ſuſpected of the Rochelers. The victualling alſo of <hi>Browage</hi> was taken for a ſtoare houſe againſt their Towne.</p>
               <p>There was a Gentleman named <hi>la Roche</hi> the leſſer, who went many voyages betwéene the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> and the <hi>Q. Mother,</hi> to agree of the place, and other meanes of the interuiew. The <hi>Q.</hi> by little and little
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:8966:73"/>
did draw nere to <hi>Xainctonge:</hi> the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> would haue aduaunced as farre as <hi>Champaigne</hi> in <hi>Tourene,</hi> ſo that the Marſhall <hi>Byron,</hi> who had paſſed <hi>Loyre,</hi> to aſſault <hi>Poytow,</hi> would retire beyond <hi>Loyre,</hi> and that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1586. October"/> thing he required for his ſecuritie.</p>
               <p>The Queene would, that he ſhould truſt in her; the King willed her to truſt in him; ſhe aleaged her good will, he aleaged his fidelitie &amp; innocencie, who did neuer breake his word toward any perſon. Shee did lay to his charge, that he was the cauſe that the parley could not be brought to paſſe. He anſwered, that it did ſtay but in her, that <hi>France</hi> was not in quietnes, &amp; that he was ready to ſee her, ſo that it were in a ſure place, and that his way might be ſure.</p>
               <p>Whileſt theſe thing paſſed ſo betweene the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by meſſengers, ſome coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelled the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> to help <hi>Chastilion,</hi> which was then beſieged by the Duke <hi>d'Mayne:</hi> others willed him not to take heede to her deceitefull words, and to expect the ſame courteſies which he had receaued heretofore at their hands.</p>
               <p>It is ſaide before, how that among thoſe fiue armies which were prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Aprill and May, the commaunder <hi>Chaſtre</hi> was appoynted to furniſh a Nauie in <hi>Britain,</hi> well prouided. And in Auguſt, as they were taking <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Auguſt"/> order for the place and manner of the interuiew, this Nauy on a ſuddaine came before <hi>Rochel,</hi> which thing was the cauſe, that all was on the point to bee broken. The King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> complained to the King by the Lorde <hi>Riaulx,</hi> beſeeching his Maieſtie to call back that armie, ſhewing that hee could not leaue a towne of ſuch importance as that was, in that ſtate, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſeeking for the quietnes and ſafety thereof. The armie notwithſtanding remoued not thence, as long as they had any prouiſion of victuals, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer meanes the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> made for it: but at length in the moneth of Nouember, the famine made them hoyſe vp ſailes, and not the Kinges commaundement.</p>
               <p>The ſelfe ſame day that the Nauie tooke vp ancker, Captaine <hi>Arman</hi> was taken with letters of the Queene, to the commaunder <hi>Chaſtre,</hi> by the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Nouemb."/> which hee was commaunded not to depart, or elſe not to goe farre from <hi>Rochel:</hi> theſe letters fell into the hands of the King of <hi>Nauarre.</hi> Hee not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ouercomming with patience all theſe occaſions, which hee might take to refuſe the parely, he offered to ſee the Queene, vpon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions aboue ſaid, requiring that in the meane time, there ſhould no act of hoſtilitie be done of either ſides.</p>
               <p>The Queene required a truce to be taken, and publiſhed. The King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> anſwered, that he could not conſent thereunto, for as much as hee had promiſed to his partakers, to enter into no agreement of peace, without their aduiſe and conſent: ſhee found (to her thinking) that anſwer very ſtrange. Thus like the <hi>Carthagenians,</hi> who wept when they ſhould pay
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:8966:74"/>
tribute to the <hi>Romans,</hi> but were not moued at all, when they yéelded them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues tributaries to them. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1586. Nouemb."/>
               </p>
               <p>For when the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> anſwered to the Kings meſſengers, that he would ſtay yet ſixe moneths for the Kings ſuccour, afore hee would employ his friends, and that he would firſt be demaunded of peace, before he would reſolue himſelfe to warre. Now, when ſhee findes that hee hath giuen his word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhe weepeth: it had been better to haue wept when the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts were broken, the innocent iudged guiltie, the obedient rebels, and the iuſt malefactors. After much a doo, the <hi>Q. Mother</hi> graunted certaine paſports, which the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> demanded for to aduertiſe his friends what he was in hand to doo. At the ſelfe ſame time, ſhee cauſed the truce to be proclaymed, which almoſt mard all, for the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> ſuſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that vnder colour of that truce, ſhee would ſtay the leauie of the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes.</p>
               <p>Thereupon the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> ſhewed vnto her, that this truce had a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Decemb."/> reſpect vnto a common ſecuritie, and that it ſhould haue been done by the common aduiſe, ſo he cauſed the publiſhing to be called in, yet was it ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly printed, and ſent into <hi>Germanie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As they were about to conclude the ſaide truce, certaine of the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the Lord <hi>Neufuy</hi> were charged, which did greatly offend the King of <hi>Nauarre.</hi> Thus this negotiation of peace going forward by meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to and fro, the Duke <hi>d'Mayne</hi> in the meane while (ſuppoſing that the <hi>Q. Mothers</hi> abſence from the Court, might bee a good helpe to doo ſome good exploit) haſted his iourney from <hi>Puynormand,</hi> where his army partly weary and aſhamed to obey ſuch a cowardly Captaine, partly for want of money was ſcattered, euery man repairing where hee thought to ſpeede beſt: the Duke <hi>de Mayne</hi> (I ſay) came to <hi>Paris,</hi> where hee and the reſt of that houſe began to make new broyles.</p>
               <p>But to returne to the matter, at length after many voyages to and fro, <hi>la Roche</hi> brought an order, both for the place and manner of the interuiew, and alſo of the truce graunted of both parts. For the accompliſhment thereof, therefore the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> came to <hi>larnak,</hi> a towne ſituated vpon the riuer <hi>Charante</hi> betweene <hi>Coignak</hi> and <hi>Engoleſme</hi> the 11. of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember, ſo the 13. day he want to Saint <hi>Brice</hi> with a good companie.</p>
               <p>At the firſt meeting there were many complaintes of both ſides: the Queene reproached him of his diſobedience, &amp; paſſing ouer the former acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſhe ſtayed vpon the preſent calamities which doo afflict <hi>Fraunce;</hi> ſhe let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth him vnderſtand, that the King was enforced to make peace with the League to ſaue his eſtate, and that without that remedie, all was loſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that the pretence of religion ought to be taken away, to take away the warre out of the realme.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:8966:74"/>
The King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> on the other ſide anſwered to the firſt complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that he had none other way been damnicted or endaungered, but by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1586. Decemb."/> obaying the King: for the League was waxed ſtrong, becauſe he remained ſo long feeble, and that hee had hazarded his life to keepe his faith. Furthermore, reducing all the preſent calamities to the head ſpring, hee imputed all the miſeries, wherewith the realme is afflicted, to the peace made by the League: hee ſhewed alſo that the King was rather deceaued with ill counſell, then forced to doo that which he did.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, he ſhewed that the preſeruation of the Kings eſtate, depended of the intertaining of his edicts, and that they were his edicts in deede, which he had voluntarily ſworne.</p>
               <p>Alſo, that they were edicts of peace, which chaſed away warre, and not they which (for to ſatiſfy certaine ſeditious perſons raiſed in ſome prouince) repleniſhed the realme with ſedition.</p>
               <p>Madam (ſaid he) you cannot accuſe me, but of too much fidelitie: I doo not complaine of your faith, but of your age, which dooing wrong to your memorie, hath made you to forget what you had promiſed me: This was the end of the firſt interuiew.</p>
               <p>The ſumme of the principall articles of this truce, was, that it ſhoulde indure vnto the ſixt of Ianuarie, that ſhee might aduertiſe the King what was done, and that the ſaide truce, if the King dooth not agree to it, ſhall be prolonged fifteene dayes, for euerie one to retire, or elſe to take further aduiſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, to auoyde the diſorders, the impoſtes, ſubtilties, and other payments, ſhall not be gathered by neither ſide, and that within the firſt of Ianuarie next comming, fifteene thouſand crownes ſhall bee deliuered or leauied vpon the places, which they of the religion holde for the maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Gariſons of the reformed religion.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that the Proteſtants ſhall ceaſe to leauie the tenths, goods and rents of Prieſtes, where they haue heretofore leauied them: and as for the goods of the Catholicks, ſeazed on by them of the reformed religion, they ſhall not meddle neither of the one ſide, nor of the other.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the men of warre of both ſides, ſhall make no roades, oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, nor any act of hoſtilitie, during the ſaide truce.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all, the <hi>Q.

This was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded at <hi>Tours,</hi> the 19. of December: in this truce were comprehended <hi>Poytow, Xainctonge, Engomoys, Lodumoyes, Mirebaloys.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Vicount <hi>Turenne</hi> was ſent to <hi>Coignak,</hi> a Towne vpon the riuer

               <p>There the <hi>Q.</hi> hauing agreed to theſe articles, &amp; ſome other depending of theſe, gaue him to vnderſtand, that for to haue peace the king of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarre</hi> muſt needes cauſe the exerciſe of the reformed religion to ceaſe in the townes which he did hold: and gaue him a ſpeciall charge to declare to the ſayd King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> that this was the kinges will.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> being in the way to come to ſee her, was met by the ſayd Vicount, who declared vnto his Maieſty, what he was encharged by the <hi>Q. Mother</hi> to ſhew him. Whereupon the king was about to turne backe, but ſuppoſing tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>When he had kiſſed her handes with a ſad countenaunce, ſhe aſked him whether the Vicount <hi>Turenne</hi> had ſpoken with him, and aſſured him that it was the kinges reſolution.</p>
               <p>The king of <hi>Nauarre</hi> anſwered, that hee muſed much, that ſhee would take ſo great paynes to t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ll him that whereof his eares were already wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to heare, and that ſhe being ſo wiſe went about to reſolue a difficulty by the ſelfe ſame difficulty. Alſo that ſhe propoſed to him that thing which he could not, would not, nor ought to do.</p>
               <p>For firſt, if he ſhould forget himſelfe ſo much, as to goe about to do that which ſhee required of him, yet were hee not able to reduce all them of the religion, nor to cauſe them to leaue the exerciſe of the ſame.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he himſelfe would not, for then ſhould hee greatly hurt his conſcience and honor: and for the one hee hath God onely for iudge. His honor he ſhould greatly empayre, doing iniury to himſelfe, when he ſhould ſeeme to yeeld more to the armes of his enemies, then to the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Lord and King.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, he anſwered that he ought ſo doe: for if he ſhould ſeeme to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of that which was propoſed to him, he ſhould ſeeme to allow the colour which the Leaguers haue pretended: in whoſe pretences doth conſiſt the ſtrength of their armes, and in the ſtrength of their armes the decay and vndoing of the ſtate.</p>
               <p>And although he knew well, that in ſo doing he ſhould approach neere the fauors of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king, yet ſhould he geue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> opportunity to take from him both the right which to him appertayneth, and to bereaue the king of the faythfulleſt friend and ſeruant hee had.</p>
               <p>But they will not haue ſuch men as I am aboue the king (ſayd he) for thereby they ſhould be miſerable, he ſhould be better ſerued, and all his ſubiects better gouerned.</p>
               <p>To this anſwere the <hi>Queene</hi> replyed nothing, but went about to make
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:8966:75"/>
himſelfe feele the diſcommodities which hee ſuffered by meanes of that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion which hee profeſſed. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1586. Decemb."/>
               </p>
               <p>I beare them willingly (ſaid hee) when you haue layed them vpon me (as it ſeemeth) to eaſe your ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Atlength ſhe reproached him, that he did not in <hi>Rochel</hi> what he would.</p>
               <p>Yes Madam (ſaid he) for I will nothing but what I ſhould.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Neuers</hi> tooke the word, that he could not ſet an impoſt in <hi>Rochel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>True (ſayd he) for wee haue no Italians among vs.</p>
               <p>After theſe ſpeaches ſhee opened vnto him agayne a generall truce for a yeare, on that condition, that there ſhould bee no exerciſe of the reformed religion within the realme, and within that time the ſtates ſhould be called.</p>
               <p>He anſwered, that if they of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> religion ſhould ſo lightly geue ouer their holdes, that the League would bee ſtronger, the king weaker, and the ſtates more vnprofitable.</p>
               <p>Alſo, that it were impoſſible to ceaſe the religion in <hi>France,</hi> except it were by a counſell duly aſſembled.</p>
               <p>So he taking his leaue of the <hi>Queene,</hi> ſhe ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tymes repeated the ſame ſpeeches which ſhe had with the Vicount <hi>Turenne,</hi> &amp; willed him to let the nobility which folowed him vnderſtand of it: which thing themorow after he did with great griefe, fearing to cauſe ſome alteration in theyr mindes.</p>
               <p>After that, hee ſent two noble men of the mildeſt ſpirites in all his troupes, to wit, the Lords <hi>Mauguyon</hi> &amp; <hi>Force,</hi> to witnes vnto her what ſorrow euery one of them had conceaued, to ſee things reduced to ſuch an extreame reſolution: and alſo to knowe whether they had any other thing to hope of the power which the king had giuen her.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Queene</hi> ſeeing, that all was vpon the poynt to be broken, ſaid, that ſhouee wld ſend the Lord <hi>Ramboullet</hi> to the king to know his laſt deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.</p>
               <p>She after told the Prince <hi>Monpenſier,</hi> that all which ſhe had ſayd to the Vicount <hi>Turenne,</hi> was but by the way of diſcourſe, diſſembling to haue had ſuch ſpeeches in playne tearmes to the king of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> and willed the ſayd Prince to let the king of <hi>Nauarre</hi> vnderſtand, that ſhee had a great deſire to ſee him agayne, and alſo prayed him to make meanes of ſome prorogation of truce, which thinge the ſayd Prince ſhewed to the king of <hi>Nauarre</hi> when hee went to take his leaue from him.</p>
               <p>Theſe double dealings of the <hi>Queene</hi> was diuerſly ſpoken, for ſome thought (to content the League) ſhe would not open the meanes topeace.</p>
               <p>Others thought, that her Counſell being Leaguers, fed her with new hope, grounded vpon the afflicted affayres of the religion, promiſing her at length to obtaine a peace to the kinges contentation: ſo they lead her cloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to entertaine a warre profitable for the League.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:8966:76"/>
The Lord <hi>Rambouillet</hi> returned from the court, brought the oth, which the king had ſworne in the ſolemnities of the order of the holy ghoſt, neuer to conſent to the exerciſe of the reformed religion: at whoſe returne the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1586 Decemb."/> 
                  <hi>Q. Mother</hi> was very important to haue a third parley with the king of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> geuing forth that the returne of the Lord <hi>Rambouillet</hi> ſhould be agreeable to him: to the which thing hee was very vnwilling to condeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend, ſuppoſing the hope which he had conceaued of that interuiew would be if not loſt, yet farre wide out of the way.</p>
               <p>They of his ſide diſcouraged him, fearing that he would not only conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue the ſpeaches which ſhee had vttered before, and alſo to reiterate often times the truce, hauing aduertizements that the truce was ſent into <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> and <hi>Suiſſerland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Others aduiſed him, that ſhe held him in hand about a treatie of peace, in the meane time to prepare warre againſt him. That ſhee propoſed him of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1587.

               <p>Some others gaue him notice, that ſhe ſolicited the next townes and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to execute the kinges laſt edict: and that fayning to ſeeke the common benefit of the ſtate, ſhe did much hurt in particular to the ſtate of <hi>Rochel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Vppon this earneſt ſute of the <hi>Q Mother,</hi> in Februarie the Leaguers tooke by force the Towne of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ouans,</hi> and fayre <hi>Montau,</hi> the which being places of no importance, cauſed men to ſuſpect ſome treachery. The K. of <hi>Nauarre</hi> alſo thought that hee might not expect y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they would giue him any good thing, which tooke ſo great pains to take away ſo litle from him: notwithſtanding the <hi>Queene</hi> did ſo preſſe him, that hee graunted the third interview, either to make the world know and ſee, that the fault was not in him if they did not obtayne peace: or elſe that he perſwaded himſelfe that the <hi>Queene</hi> would not take ſo much paines to bring him ill newes. Shee therefore tooke her iourney to <hi>Fontenay.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The 20. of February the king of <hi>Nauarre</hi> came to <hi>Marans,</hi> accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with many noble men and company of Rochelers about threehundred men, guyded by the Lord <hi>Gargoleau</hi> and other Captaynes, hauing the Colonels enſigne of <hi>Rochel:</hi> his comming thether was to parley with the <hi>Q. Mother,</hi> which was already at <hi>Fontenay.</hi> But for becauſe the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teruiew was to be made firſt in the Ile <hi>Ellen,</hi> and after for her eaſe at the Fort <hi>Veluyre,</hi> the Lordes <hi>Biron</hi> and <hi>Sariſack,</hi> with many other came to the king of <hi>Nauarre</hi> to agree of the place.</p>
               <p>As the will to ſee one another did encreaſe; ſo the miſtruſt did growe in their counſels. For the <hi>Q. Mother</hi> (or rather ſome of hers) did feare to goe to the place where the Rochelers were ſtronger. And for as much as it was reported that the Enſigne Colonell was at the foord <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>eluyre,</hi> they made as though they did feare to approach, conſidering alſo that the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelers
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:8966:76"/>
had ſet vp ſtrong Barriers for the ſafetie of the King of <hi>Nauarre.</hi> Theſe things ſhe pretended to bee the cauſes that ſhe would not come the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1587. Februarie"/> But in very deede ſhe and hers ſawe not there the commoditie how to execute that which they pretended to doo. The King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> did feare the entrances and turnings of theſe Mariſhes: for the naturall ſituation of that countrey is ſuch, that a man may doo a feate without great ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard.</p>
               <p>Whileſt theſe going too and fro were betwéene them, the League tooke the alarum by theſe actions of the <hi>Q.</hi> but partly to let the peace which they did greatly feare, and partly (ſeeing ſome occaſion) to execute their intended purpoſe, did conſpire againſt the Kings perſon.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Q. Mother</hi> perceiuing that ſhe could not execute that for which ſhe was ſent, (for no doubt ſhe neuer entended to make any peace, but to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſome treacherie vpon the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> his perſon) and (by the iuſt iudgement of God) that which ſhe had deuiſed againſt that vertuous and innocent Prince, ſhe heard that it was practized vpon her ſonne. She de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from <hi>Fontenay</hi> to <hi>Nyort,</hi> intending thus to take her iourney to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> where ſhe thought her preſence to be needfull. But before her depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out of the countrey, ſhe would faine to doo ſomewhat, leaſt it ſhould be ſayd ſhe had done nothing. Therefore ſhe ſent to the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> that he would ſend to her the Vicount <hi>Turenne;</hi> to whome ſhe offered li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie to talke withall. To the which thing he conſented eaſily. The <hi>Q.</hi> ſhewed that ſhe would treate with him, being informed of his prudence. The King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> conſented to that thing, being ſure of his fidelitie. All ſorts of men déemed (that becauſe he was knowne to loue the bleſſed ſtate and quietnes of the Realme) he was indéede a fit inſtrument, if the counſell of the <hi>Q.</hi> would haue vſed him vnto that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>The Vicount <hi>Turenne</hi> for that purpoſe came to <hi>Fontenay,</hi> and hauing certified the <hi>Q.</hi> that he was there to receaue his commandements, ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed vnto him to make a generall truce, and that the affayres were ſuch as there could be no talke of a peace as yet: for the which propoſition hée anſwered.</p>
               <p>That the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> would eaſily conſent to that, and that hee would alwayes allow the name of truce, ſo that it would produce the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uents of a good peace. But that hitherto they had ſo ſtopped their cares to his requeſts, that he had beene enforced to imploy his friends to that ende hee might bee heard, and that hee coulde make neither peace, nor generall truce without their aduiſe and conſent, for hee was elected protector of a part, forſaken by the King, which conſiſted of many particular perſons who had beene particularly iniuryed, to whome no ſatiſfaction could be made without hearing their complaintes: that if it pleaſe her to graunt the requiſite paſportes, and a reaſonable time to call
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:8966:77"/>
them together, that it ſhould be done with all ſpeed. And for to bring this thing to paſſe, he thought good to make a particlar truce for the Prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Poytow</hi> &amp; <hi>Xainctonge</hi> for two moneths, during the which the King <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1587. February"/> of <hi>Nauarre</hi> might prouide and aduiſe vpon the means how to make the peace, for the treatie whereof, the deputies of the Prouinces might come together.</p>
               <p>The Queene thought that truce very ill, and commanded her counſell to ſhew the reaſons.</p>
               <p>One of them anſwered, that it were prciudiciable to the King, for as much as during that time of truce, the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> would haue meanes to bring the ſtrangers into the Realme.</p>
               <p>Alſo that the Catholiks would become idle, and accuſtome themſelues to reſt: alſo that they of the league, would take that truce for a ſhadow of peace, of the which fearing the bodie, they would make a ſecond inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>
               <p>To thoſe reaſons the Vicount of <hi>Turenne</hi> anſwered, that the place of the entring of the ſtraungers, had no correſpondence with the high and low <hi>Poytow,</hi> and that the treatie of peace, did rather ſtay, than further the leauie of them.</p>
               <p>He anſwered alſo to the ſecond reaſon, which hee ſaid to be common to both parts, and that they of the reformed Religion would abuſe reſt ſooner, than the Catholikes, becauſe they were leſſe vſed to it.</p>
               <p>As for the inſurrection of the league, he would ſay nothing to it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he knew not not what they might doo. But this hee knewe that the Duke of <hi>Guyze</hi> had but a ſmall power: The Duke <hi>de Mayne</hi> had broken his armie, and that of ſmall rubbell there was neuer great buildinges made.</p>
               <p>But for becauſe he had ſpoken hitherto without charge, being come only to heare, the Queene thought good that hee ſhould returne to the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> to bee particularly inſtructed of his pleaſure.</p>
               <p>Comming then to the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> hee found him well aſſured of the leauie of <hi>Germaines,</hi> by a man which came the ſelfeſame day.</p>
               <p>The ſame day the Vicount <hi>Turenne</hi> returned to the Queene ſpeedily, &amp; fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d her at <hi>Niort,</hi> determined to take her iourney to <hi>Paris:</hi> he was heard, and made an ample diſcourſe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> proſperous ſtate of the K. of <hi>Nauarre.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, that he had ſuſtayned the burthen of fiue armies, which haue ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued for nothing els, but to ſhew that he was ſtill in readines, for the try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of the forces of his enemies: contrarywiſe that they were deceaued both in forces and credit, &amp; that they had reaſons to the conſpiracies and ſeditions of a towne not able to warre in the fielde.</p>
               <p>Alſo that they could hope for no more ſuccor of the ſpantard, who was ſo occupyed to defend himſelfe, that he could not doe ſo much as to dreame
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:8966:77"/>
to aſſault others: that if the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> had loſt ſome weake villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, he had fortified ſtrong holdes. And whereas hee had beene hitherto <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1587. February"/> vpon the defenſiue: now he hath power to make his enemies to take his part. That he hath a mightie armie of ſtrangers, whom the neceſſitie of his affayres did neuer procure him to call to his ſuccour. That hee neuer thought to imploy their ſeruice to make warre, but rather to make a good peace.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, that notwithſtanding he hath receaued extreame iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, yet it neuer came in his minde to vſe that to bee reuenged of them, whome he knew to be ſeruants of this Crowne.</p>
               <p>The Lord of <hi>Neuers</hi> aſſured him whether the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> had not bound himſelfe to the preiudice of his crowne.</p>
               <p>The Vicount continuing his diſcourſe, beſeeched the Queene in moſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="March"/> humble wiſe, to beleeue that he was neither raſh, nor a lyar, and that hee would ſay nothing but what he knew certainly to be true; and that if hee knew otherwiſe, he would neuer diſguiſe the truth, but that he certainly knew that the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> had done nothing with the ſtrangers which be not for the good and quietnes of the ſtate, and to reſtore to the King and his faithfull ſeruants their authoritie.</p>
               <p>And to that ende Madame (ſaide hee) that you may iudge of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, he proteſteth that whenſoeuer your Maieſties pleaſure is to vſe his forces, he will euer turne his face that way, whither the commoditie of the Realme and your comandement ſhall call him.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> (ſaid he) continuing his diſcourſes, hath alwaies beleeued that the King hauing taken warre in hand being the weaker, will neuer be able to reſtore peace before he be ſtronger. And then ſhall he be ſtronger indeed, when the Princes of his blood ſhall haue his forces in hand, to reſtore the obedience which is due to him.</p>
               <p>This is the laſt remedie Madame (ſaid he) which I could wiſh to bee otherwiſe. And I doo tell you this particularly as ſeruant to your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie, and not as a <hi>Hugonet,</hi> to whome (it may be) it were more ſure to expect an armie, than a Negotiation, and a battell, than an edict. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue not Madame, that damage of the State is ſought by the friendes thereof; it is more profitable and honourable to conſent voluntarily to a peace, and to chooſe by time with a good will the meanes thereof, then to take the ſame enforced by neceſſitie.</p>
               <p>The Queene ſaid, that they ſhould then ſtay the armie of ſtrangers, and did much braule about the forme of paſportes.</p>
               <p>Then the Vicount replied, Madam, if yee bee ſo vnwilling to giue vs good wordes, we are not come to that paſſe to expect good effects, for the which we ſhould ſtay the longer if we ſhould ſtay for the meanes whereby, to enforce you thereunto. Madam, the time is no more that we will aſſure

our ſelues vpon a ſingle promiſe, ſeeing that the edicts haue fayled vs.</p>
               <p>The Queene did ſo giue eare to theſe reaſons, that ſhee ſeemed to haue her minde occupied more vpon the aduertiſements which were giuen her <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1587.

The Duke <hi>d'Mayne</hi> was in <hi>Paris,</hi> practiſing againſt the Kings perſon: the Duke of <hi>Guize</hi> was about to put himſelfe into <hi>Paris</hi> alſo. They made her ſee in their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſements, the occaſions which the heads of the League had to giue the laſt blow of diſpaire, they did ſhew her that the hope which the Leaguers had of <hi>England</hi> was dead with the Quéene of <hi>Scottes,</hi> and that the deuotion of the Cleargy did coole as faſt as the ambition of the League did heate. They ſhewed her how the ſixe armies alreadie were ſpent and conſumed without dooing any thing, that they of the reformed religion were growne ſtrong, ſo that there was no more hope for them to build out of the ruines of them, whereby it appeared euidently in what daunger of them the King ſtoode. All theſe things being ſet before her eyes, made her to take her iourney in haſte from <hi>Niort</hi> to <hi>Paris,</hi> fearing leaſt theſe ſeditious perſons, who had left nothing more to enterpriſe, would execute their miſchieuous intents vpon the Kings perſon: therefore at the ſame time, the miſtruſt did greatly encreaſe at the Court, where there were diuers factions, for the King miſtruſted the Leaguers, and the Leaguers the King, and among the Leaguers, one miſtruſted another. Euery one going about, vnder the colour of defending the Romiſh religion, to lay downe the foundation of their greatnes by rebellion, murther, and particide: which ſturring of rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, cauſed alſo that this generall truce which was in hand was not brought to effect.</p>
               <p>It is ſaide before, that the 13. day of December 1586. the <hi>Q<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Mother</hi>

               <p>Now therefore knowing the ſtate of the affaires, the king of <hi>Nauarre</hi> prayeth them to giue him their aduiſe what is expedient to be done, great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſiring in that which concerneth the honour of God, and the common quietneſſe of his whole church, to proceed (as he hath done before) not in following his owne opinion, but by the common aduiſe and conſent of all.</p>
               <p>He willeth them to know, that as partaker of the miſeries, of the griefs, &amp; vexations, which ſo many perſons do ſuffer in their ſoules, bodies, &amp; goods, being partaker of ſo many gronings and teares, of ſo many poore families ſcattered and depriued of their commodityes: he hath alwaies deſired that for their deliuerance it might pleaſe God to giue vs a good peace.

               <p>And them, which through feeblenes, or heauy burthen of euils, haue fallen to keepe their hartes to God, and that they will not ſuffer that fire of zeale, whereof they do feele yet the heat, to be cooled and quenched, hoping for their deliuerance, that by the meanes thereof, and the grace of God, they may reunite themſelues, and ioine to that body where from they are gone.</p>
               <p>That they will aſſure themſelues both the one and the other, that there ſhall neuer be peace before affaires be eſtabliſhed as wel beyond as on this ſide of <hi>Loyre:</hi> and that the ſaid king will prouide for neceſſarie ſafety in caſe of imminent danger for their ſafe retire, otherwiſe there ſhould be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing done.</p>
               <p>As the king of <hi>Nauarre</hi> beareth to them, and all that concerne them a ſingular loue and affection, that they would render vnto him the like: that Godbleſſing ſuch a correſpondance of good willes, we may all enioyne to his honor and glorie the fruit, which ſuch vnity and concord would bring to the confuſion of Gods enemies.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is ſayd before, how the Duke of <hi>Guize</hi> in the apprehenſion, of a great fright, &amp; in a great heate went both to complaine to the King, how all the heretickes of <hi>France</hi> had conſpired to ioyne their forces together, to oppreſſe his brother the Duke <hi>de Mayne,</hi> almoſt deſtitute of defence: and alſo to giue him counſell how to let ſuch a dangerous aſſociation of them, to wit, by diuerting their forces. And that could not be done, but by ſending ſeuerall armies into ſeuerall Prouinces, where they of the religion were ſtrong. It is alſo ſayd, how vpon this aduiſe the King prouided ſixe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, whereof be ſent one into <hi>Poytow,</hi> and another into <hi>Languedock,</hi> the third into <hi>Daulphine,</hi> the fourth into <hi>Auuergne,</hi> and the laſt was a Nauie conducted by the Commaunder <hi>la Chaſtre,</hi> and the ſixt moſt daungerous was lead by his Mother agaynſt the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> vnder the colour of parley of peace, hauing with her a legion of Italian wrenches and figges which did her no ſeruice.</p>
               <p>Whileſt the King was left alone, and his forces ſcattered farre &amp; wide from him, the Duke of <hi>Guize</hi> aduiſed himſelfe of a <hi>dilemma,</hi> that either he might eaſily oppreſſe the King, or els at leaſt might worke iollily the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of the people. Therfore he called his brother the Duke <hi>de Mayne,</hi> began to complayne greatly of the King, and to impute the ill ſucceſſe of his brother in <hi>Guyenne</hi> to him, to wit, how his brother was forſaken, deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of men, money and munition. That this was the argument, that the Catholikes were betrayed, that the King was corrupted by counſell, and that he hated and deſpiſed them whom hee ſhould loue and embrace: and that he had intelligences with the heretickes. And that if he would not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henerite and degrade the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> then there was no cauſe why the Catholikes ſhould commit their liues to a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling King, who had nothing in his tongue but warre, and in his hart

did ſeeke for peace with heretikes. And therefore they cryed out that the enemie was at hand, and ſtoode at the doore, and that omitting and leauing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1586.

This was the leſſon which his fauourers ſhould repeate with great vehemencie, among men of all degrees, when they met in companie.</p>
               <p>By theſe falſe reports and trayterous ſlaunders, much hatred and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liking of his gouernment was procured to the King. Yet conſidering that both he and his partakers were very néere daunger, the <hi>Q.

               <p>For as much as the voyage and practizes of the <hi>Q.

For without his counſell, power and countenance, they had béen reduced to that plunge, as they had neuer béen able to get out.</p>
               <p>With this newe yeare therefore 1587. we will begin this fourth booke, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Januarie"/> which will ſhewe marueilous tempeſts and euents to haue béen brought foorth, to the ſmall aduantage of Gods enemies, yet to the great furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of that rebellion which hath enſued, wrought, and procured by the Leaguers.

that the King made all preparations which could bee poſſible againſt the Germanes, both in the heart of <hi>France,</hi> and on the way which they ſhould come in, to receaue them with ſmall courteſie.

               <p>Secondly, that the reformed religion be receaued throughout all the Prouince of <hi>Daulphine</hi> indifferently: and that they of the reformed religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhall permit the Romiſh, and ſuffer the church men to enter and enioy their goods and liuinges: on both ſides they do promiſe to acknowledge the court of Parliament of <hi>Grenoble,</hi> and to obay the Lord <hi>Maugyron:</hi> &amp; that whatſoeuer alteration may happen to the State, the king of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarre</hi> ſhall imploy his authority preſent, and to come to the obſeruation of the agreement, namely, in that which doth concerne the dignity of the court, of the Lieutenant, of the King, and of the church men.</p>

               <p>Although the Lord <hi>Eſpernon</hi> be a moſt zealous and deuout Catholike, &amp; that he did agaynſt them of the reformed religion all that euer he could, yet with ſome moderatnes he had committed the gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of his charge to the Lord <hi>Valete</hi> his brother, which vſed the ſame valiantnes, with the like modeſty: God did ſo bleſſe the good intents of theſe two noble Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes indeede, as iſſued out of an ancient and noble ſtocke, without any degenerating, that hauing well rid that Prouince of <hi>Daulphine</hi> of ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and factions Leaguers, afterward the Catholikes and reformed haue fallen to a good and peaceable compoſition, by the which they haue enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned themſelues in amity, and kept their countrey from ranſacking, and ſubuerſion.</p>

This learned and godly man had faithfully and vertuouſly executed the miniſtery in that towne, and there he confirmed the doctrine which he had preached, with a moſt conſtant and Chriſtian death, which was vnhappie to them, who without a cauſe put him to the ſame. For they themſelues who executed that vniuſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, would not diſſemble to ſay (after they had heard the earneſt confeſſion of his faith and praiers which he made in the end of his life) that certainely God would reuenge the death of ſo good and godly a man, in

               <p>For although the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> fayned that he would defend <hi>Maran</hi> againſt that armie, as he did the yeare before againſt the Marſhall <hi>Byron,</hi> at the ſelfeſame ſeaſon, yet notwithſtanding hee had not determined ſo to doo, as alſo it was a thing impoſſible to defend it, for the Mariſhes and dit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and channels were ſo dried vp, and the earth ſo hardened, that the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men could eaſilie goe thorough euery where: there was ſome more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commoditie for horſemen, by reaſon of the ſteps, but yet it was acceſſible euery where.</p>
               <p>In the meane time, the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> ſent in the regiment of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Preau,</hi> with ſome other companies, who ſhewed great diligence in fortifying the holdes of <hi>Bastile, Brune, Poyneuf,</hi> and <hi>Clowſie:</hi> as for the Fort <hi>Brault,</hi> the King made it in forme of <hi>Sheeres</hi> on the ſide of the land, and had determined to defend that onely and the Caſtell. The others were only to holde the enemie in hand, and in the meane time that this reſolution might be ſtayed, the heads hauing commaundement to retire into the towne, and not harden themſelues obſtinately in the defence of the ſaid Fortes. After that the Caſtell was furniſhed with neceſſaries, Captaine <hi>Preau</hi> ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyre to <hi>Fontenay,</hi> the Lord <hi>Iarry</hi> with a number of Souldiours ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyre into the Caſtell, when he ſhould be enforced to forſake the towne, and there to abide the force of the enemie for eyght dayes: which thing he could doo well enough. In the which ſpace, the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> and the Prince hauing aſſembled their forces, woulde haue giuen ſo many croſſes to the Duke <hi>Ioyeuſe,</hi> that perhappes he ſhould not haue needed to take the paine to goe to dye at <hi>Coutras:</hi> notwithſtanding, for theſe conſiderations or other, the Duke <hi>Ioyeuſe</hi> ſet not on <hi>Marans,</hi> but at the requeſt of the Lord Saint <hi>Luke</hi> and others, going out of <hi>Niort</hi> through the countrey of <hi>Aunix,</hi> and the towne <hi>Sorgeres,</hi> went to batter <hi>Tonnay Charante,</hi> which he tooke by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition: and there vnderſtanding that the companie of the Lorde <hi>Puelles</hi> was at <hi>Croixchapeau,</hi> halfe the way betweene <hi>Tonney Charante</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel,</hi> he went with the choyſe of his armie, to ſet vpon them at the breaking of the day.</p>
               <p>This companie commaunded by ſome officer (for the Lord <hi>Puelles</hi> was then at <hi>Rochel)</hi> did moſt couragiouſly defend themſelues: but the place was ſuch, as the enemie had meanes to encloſe them on euery ſide, and to get
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:8966:85"/>
to the top of the houſes through the back ſide, and to driue them out by ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the houſes on fire: great part of them was ſlaine in the fight; other yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1587.

They were almoſt all killed againſt the faith giuen to them, with like ſauagenes, and barbarous crueltie, as the Souldiours of <hi>Debory</hi> and <hi>Charboniere</hi> were at the <hi>Mote</hi> Saint <hi>Eloy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This done, the Lord <hi>Ioyeuſe</hi> returned to <hi>Tonney Charante</hi> (vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> was gone out of <hi>Rochel</hi> to ſet vpon him) and thence to <hi>Niort.</hi> At the ſame time, they which were at <hi>Marans</hi> did looke to be ſet on, but he vnderſtanding that ſome companies of the Prince <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Iuly"/> had taken <hi>Tonney Charante,</hi> vpon the Gariſon which hee had left there, in haſt returned thether with his Ordinance, tooke it againe, being kept only by a ſergiant of a band, who with 15. Souldiours onely, had obſtinatly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken the defence thereof.</p>
               <p>In the ſelfe ſame place he was aduertiſed of the euill watch, and of the ſmall company which was at the Abbey of <hi>Maillezay,</hi> a very ſtrong place, thether he went with ſpeede, and the Lorde <hi>Malicorne</hi> gouernour of <hi>Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tow</hi> with him, he compaſſed it ſo, that it was not poſſible to put in new for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſo that the fourth day after it was ſurrendered by compoſition.</p>
               <p>After the taking of <hi>Maillezay,</hi> it was thought that the Duke <hi>Ioyeuſe</hi> would ſet on <hi>Marans,</hi> but hee durſt not, fearing the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> and the Prince, who were in the field ſeeking occaſion. Some dayes after <hi>Ioyeſue</hi> made a ſhew to ſet vpon <hi>Talmound,</hi> but the Lord Saint <hi>Stephen</hi> hauing ſeazed vpon it firſt, cauſed him to haue no great affection thereto. So as his armie decayed dayly, being infected with the Peſtilence: the King of <hi>Nauarres</hi> on the other ſide waxed ſtrong.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Ioyeuſe</hi> hauing ſtayed in <hi>Poytow</hi> ſomewhat leſſer then three moneths, about the 15. day of Auguſt he rode in poſte to <hi>Paris</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Guize,</hi> as well to informe him of his noble actes, and what Kingdomes hee had conquered in winning few villages in <hi>Poytow,</hi> as to miniſter texts vnto the Fryers and Ieſuits to preach vpon vnto the ſottiſh people of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris:</hi> to wit, the notable ſlaughters which hee had committed vpon the here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks in <hi>Poytow,</hi> he was receaued with exceeding ioye of the Pariſions, he left his companies with the Lorde <hi>Lauerdine,</hi> who conducted them after him all by eaſe.</p>
               <p>But the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> who ſlept not, went forth out of <hi>Rochel</hi> vpon the newes of the retiring of the ſaide <hi>Ioyeuſe,</hi> with a marueilous celeritie, and paſſing through <hi>Marans</hi> with ſome horſemen, purſued the remnant of that armie ſo liuely, (and that with few men) that he diſcomfited three companies of men of warre, conducted by the Marquis <hi>Renel,</hi> tooke their Enſignes, and many of them, with a great number of Gentlemen.</p>
               <p>This being done, he purſued after <hi>Lauerdine,</hi> which conducted the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:8966:86"/>
with two culuerines, but with the fauour of paſſages ouer the riuers, ſaued himſelf in the <hi>Haye</hi> in <hi>Tourenne,</hi> where the king of <hi>Nauarre</hi> beſieged <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1587.

               </p>
               <p>Whileſt theſe thinges were paſſing thus in <hi>Poytow,</hi> the king about the 23. of Iune vnderſtood that the army of Germans, both great and ſtrong was in readines to take their iourney into <hi>France:</hi> whereupon the King determined to prepare not onely to defend himſelfe, but alſo to inuade the enemie. Therefore he ſendeth his commiſſioners into all Prouinces, to aſſemble all his Nobilitie, with all their forces, and them to deuide into three ſeuerall armies, wherof the <hi>rendes vous</hi> of the one vnder the conduct of the Duke of <hi>Guyze,</hi> comprehending the Nobilitie and others who were knowen notorious leaguers, was giuen the 20. of Iuly in the towne of <hi>Chaumont</hi> in <hi>Baſſignye.</hi> The ſecond armie vnder the conduct of the K. himſelfe, was of the Nobilitie, in the which hee had moſt truſt, out of <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cardy, France, Normandie, Britayne,</hi> and other Prouinces betweene <hi>Seyne</hi> and <hi>Loyre.</hi> The <hi>rendes vous</hi> was appoynted at Saint <hi>Florentine</hi> in <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gony,</hi> between the cities of <hi>Troyes</hi> and <hi>Auxer,</hi> the firſt day of Auguſt. The third vnder the conduct of the L. <hi>Ioyeuſe,</hi> was of the Nobilitie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries beyond <hi>Loyre,</hi> and the <hi>rendes vous</hi> was aſſigned at <hi>Gien.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Guize</hi> with his armie of conſpirators and Leaguers ſhould ſtop the paſſage to the Germanes, vpon the borders of <hi>Lorreyne,</hi> &amp; ſpecially ſhould hinder them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> taking their way through <hi>Champaigne,</hi> on the north ſide of the riuer of <hi>Seyne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> about the beginning of Iune, vnderſtanding that his armie of <hi>Germanes</hi> was in readines to departe out of <hi>Germanie</hi> to come to his ſuccour, ſent Ambaſſadonrs to the King, humbly to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate him to take ſome pitie of his kingdome and poore ſubiects, both to ſhew him ſome wayes of peace, and alſo becauſe that heretofore the ſaide King had acknowledged the heads of the League to be his enemies, and to haue rayſed all theſe vprores, not ſo much againſt the houſe of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> as againſt his owne perſon: he requeſted the King to vſe his, and the <hi>Germane</hi> forces againſt the common enemie of the Realme. But the King hauing many diſloyall ſeruants, both about his perſon and in his counſell, who were greatly addicted to the league, they diſloyally betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, making him beleeue that if he ſhould accept the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> his offers, and ſo change his mind, it were the neareſt way to rayſe an v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſal rebelliou of all his ſubiects againſt him, and that this Ambaſſage of the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> did proceed, not from loue and duetie, but fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> feare and dread<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who ſaw his manifeſt ouerthrowe at hand, by theſe three great and mightie armies which he was ſetting in a readines.

Iune"/> of this Ambaſſage and proffers made by the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> was not a little amazed, fearing that the King now was better aduiſed, hauing a fit opportunity to reuenge himſelfe vpon the pride, arrogancie, &amp; iniuries proffred him by them, conſidering that they were not able to withſtand ſo great a power, and that they might be vndone ere euer they ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue it, vſeth two ſhifts to auoide the tempeſt hee ſawe comming: Firſt writeth a letter full of flattering prayers, proteſtations, and feare: for he with an humble ſtile, endeuoureth to make the king beleeue that he had been gentle and tractable, neuer refuſing the means of a good peace. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he prayeth the King to thinke no hurt in that which they had done, as not proceeding from any malice, but rather fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> zeale of the Catholike Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and inflaming him to oppoſe himſelfe and all his forces againſt the Germanes, the auncient enemies of the Realme, promiſeth him for that purpoſe, a ſtrong ayde and ſuccour againſt them. Laſt of all, hee fayned himſelfe, his partakers, and all the Catholikes, to ſtand in great feare of a ſucceſſour vnknowen, and like to be much inferiour vnto him, and an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie of the Catholike Religion, and that if hee would reſolue his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects in that matter, doo aſſure him that all things would proſper and ſucceede after his owne wiſhing.</p>
               <p>The King with his armie of Catholikes ſhould ſtay for them in <hi>Berry,</hi> and keepe their paſſages ouer the <hi>Loyre,</hi> but ſhould ſuffer them to goe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward betweene the riuers of <hi>Sene</hi> &amp; <hi>Loyre,</hi> that at length when they had gone forward in that ſliue betweene the ſaid two riuers, the Catholikes on the one ſide, and the Leaguers on the other ſide, following after them, either ſhould enforce them through difficulties to retyre homeward, the ſelfe ſame way that they came, or elſe by ſome occaſion or ſurprize ſhould oppreſſe them. The Duke <hi>Ioyeuſe</hi> with his armie ſhould goe to get the aduantage betweene the K. of <hi>Nauarre</hi> and the Germanes.</p>
               <p>Upon this occaſion the Duke <hi>Ioyeuſe</hi> (as is ſayd) repayred to <hi>Paris,</hi> there to haue his inſtructions, &amp; to receaue the Kings commandements.</p>
               <p>According to this orer the Duke <hi>Mercure,</hi> (almoſt then king of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine)</hi> taked out of <hi>Britaine</hi> as many Leaguers as he could, and being ſent vnto the Duke of <hi>Guyze</hi> vnder the conduct of the Lord <hi>Hautboys,</hi> they miſcaried by the way: for about the beginning of September they were met and ſlayne by the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> being then at <hi>Monſorean.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>During which time of the ſoiourning of the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> at <hi>Mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb n="160" facs="tcp:8966:87"/>
nigh <hi>Saumur:</hi> and ſhortly after the ſayd King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> hauing receaued the County of <hi>Soyſſons</hi> with his French companies, returned to <hi>Xainctonge,</hi> and ſo went to <hi>Rochel,</hi> where after he had remayned ſome <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1587. Decemb."/> dayes, at length he departed thence the tenth of October: there he tooke ſome peeces of artillery, and going through <hi>Taillebourg,</hi> repayred to <hi>Pons,</hi> where hauing aſſembled and muſtered all his forces, determined to paſſe into <hi>Gaſcoyne,</hi> partly to gather more forces in going, partly to ioyne with his army of Germans (which were already farre entred into <hi>Bourgundy)</hi> paſſing through the Prouinces, which were fauourable to him.</p>
               <p>For to execute this determination, it was needfull for him to paſſe the riuers <hi>Droune</hi> and <hi>Liſle,</hi> which were the neareſt, with reſolution to fight with <hi>Ioyeuſe</hi> if neede were.</p>
               <p>The Duke <hi>Ioyeuſe,</hi> had aduaunced already to Saint <hi>Mexent,</hi> when the king of <hi>Nauarre</hi> departed out of <hi>Rochel,</hi> and knowing the intent of the ſaid King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> thought to cut his way: and with great iourneys paſſing through <hi>Poytow</hi> &amp; <hi>Engomoys,</hi> came to <hi>Barbeſieulx,</hi> &amp; ſo to <hi>Roche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chalays</hi> in <hi>Perigord,</hi> with commaundement (as he ſayd) not to ſpare the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of the battayle, if other meanes would not ſerue: concluding, that by the ouerthrow of the king of <hi>Nauarre</hi> (which hee made ſure in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit) the army of the Germans would not bee able to continue.</p>
               <p>The chiefeſt aduantage in this exployt, was to paſſe ouer the ſayd ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, for it ſeemed that hee who firſt might goe ouer theſe two Riuers, would haue great aduantage vpon the other; for the which cauſe the king of <hi>Nauarre</hi> vſing that prouidence and accuſtomed diligence, which doth render him admirable, accompanied with the Princes of <hi>Conde</hi> and <hi>Soyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> the Lords <hi>Trimouille</hi> and <hi>Turenne,</hi> and others, taketh his way to paſſe the riuer <hi>Droune,</hi> and lodged at <hi>Archiak</hi> and <hi>Montlieu,</hi> and other places thereabout.</p>
               <p>The Marſhall <hi>Matygnon</hi> had geuen counſell to the ſayd <hi>Ioyeuſe,</hi> to ſeaze vpon <hi>Coutras,</hi> a towne and caſtell ſituated ſomewhat aboue the mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the ſayd riuers <hi>Liſle,</hi> and <hi>Droune,</hi> a place of importance.</p>
               <p>Both the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> and <hi>Ioyeuſe</hi> did ſtriue to get that towne, the one did ſtriue to paſſe ouer the riuer <hi>Droune,</hi> the other to ſtop the paſſage thereof.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Ioyeuſe</hi> cauſed his light horſes to aduaunce to the place, who arryued there one hower ſooner then he could haue done himſelfe. But as they were taking theyr lodginges, there they found the companyes of the king of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> which came thither alſo, to whom the enemy gaue place quickly, as beyng the weaker.</p>
               <p>The king of <hi>Nauarre</hi> therfore paſſed his forces ouer the foord of <hi>Droune,</hi> but the Duke <hi>Ioyeuſe</hi> hauing great deſire to do ſome great exployt: and conſidering that the king of <hi>Nauarre</hi> was incloſed betweene two great

riuers, he promiſed himſelfe an aſſured victory of him, as not able to auoyd any way. Therefore he giueth the <hi>rendes vous</hi> the morrow morning after beyng the 20. of October, to a certayne place betweene <hi>Rochechalays,</hi> and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1587.

                  <hi>Coutras.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The day being come, he tooke his place for the battayle, with as much aduantage as he could chooſe within halfe a league of <hi>Coutras.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here is the place, the perſons, the cauſes, and euentes to be conſideres. The place is in the very edge of <hi>Xainctonge,</hi> where he had committed hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible and ſauage cruelties, and other exceſſes againſt them of the reformed religion, which haue no names in any language. The perſons were Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guers for the moſt, Atheiſtes walking among them, vnder colour of zeale of popiſh religion, men beſides polluted for the moſt part with the bloud of the Saynts which they had ſpilled like water vpon the earth, and other abominations which follow treaſons, Idolatry, &amp; Atheiſme: they were more in number without compariſon better armed and furniſhed with all neceſſaryes.</p>
               <p>The cauſes were, that after they had for theſe foure yeares refuſed all reaſonable offers of the king of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> they hated him without a cauſe, they did draw theyr tongues and ſwords agaynſt the God of heauen, and his Goſpell with a Ciclopicall rage. Therefore <hi>Adraſta</hi> did ſtay them in that place, ſwolen with pride, arrogancie, contumelie, vaine hope and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in the arme of fleſh, which could not deliuer them.

And alſo, that the ſaincts, as it were out of the middeſt of thoſe prouinces, which do embrace the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, might ſee that the Lord is the iuſt reuenger of ſuch abominations, and defender of the iuſt cauſe. And that they may learne to feare him, and in him onely to truſt and repoſe themſelues. Here therefore <hi>Adraſtia</hi> doth ſtay them to anſwere vnto Gods iudgement.</p>
               <p>Now let vs come to the euents. The King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> early in the morning being firſt aduertyzed of this preparation, was not mooued at it; no more was hee vpon the ſecond warning. But at the third tyme he ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed no leſſer deſire to fight, then the enemy to whom twiſe before he had proffered the occaſions.</p>
               <p>He taketh horſe, rydeth forth out of <hi>Coutras</hi> to méet y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> enemy, commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the Lord <hi>Clermont</hi> maſter of his Ordinaunce, in all haſt to paſſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the canon (for he could not do it the day before:) he putteth his army in battayle array, placeth his artillery in the forefront ſo commodiouſly, that all peeces did ſeruice without harming any man of his owne, &amp; great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did endomage the enemy. At length hauing encouraged his ſouldiers to the battayle (whom he found full of deſire and readines) cauſed prayers
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:8966:88"/>
to be made from company to company.</p>
               <p>About 9. a clocke in the morning the artillery began to play on both <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1587. October"/> ſides: the ordinance of the king of <hi>Nauarre</hi> was ſo commodiouſly placed, that it did wonderfully annoy the men of Armes, which the Lord <hi>Ioyeuſe</hi> had at his right hand, and the regimentes which did flanke thoſe men of armes. Many being beaten downe with it, ſome of the heads tooke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution rather to goe to the charge, then to die ſo miſerably without any fight.</p>
               <p>The Harquebuziers in like maner began to ioyne, and there was no man on both ſides who ſhewed not to haue a great deſire to do well.</p>
               <p>The Ordinance of <hi>Ioyeuſe</hi> did let flye certayne ſhot towards the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> but without any effect, ſaue a horſe whereon a page did ride, which was ſlayne. The cauſe of this ſmall effect, was a litle riſing of the ground, which did let the free aſpect and ayming of the Ordinance, ſo that many ſhot did light vpon the ground.</p>
               <p>About nine a clocke the light horſemen of the Lord <hi>Ioyeuſe,</hi> to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of foure hundred horſes, conducted by the Lord <hi>Lauerdine,</hi> and captain <hi>Mercure,</hi> ſet on the horſemen of the king of <hi>Nauarre:</hi> but after ſome fight, began to wauer and to make roome.</p>
               <p>The reſt of the horſemen of the king of <hi>Nauarre</hi> conſiſted of 4. Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons, diſtant the one from the other in this wiſe.</p>
               <p>The Squadrons of the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> and of the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> were diſtant about a hundred and fifty paces.</p>
               <p>The Squadron of the Prince of <hi>Soiſſons,</hi> at the left hand of the king of <hi>Nauarre</hi> about three ſcore paces.</p>
               <p>The Squadron of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Vicount <hi>Turenne,</hi> diſtant ſo much from the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> at his right hand. The Lord <hi>Lauerdine</hi> charged the Vicount <hi>Turenne,</hi> but without any endomaging of him.</p>
               <p>Theſe three ſquadrons (where ſtoode the Princes of the blood ſtanding faſt) did behold all this fight, vntill the Lord <hi>Ioyeuſe</hi> followed with his mayne force of horſemen; and hauing both on the right hand and the left two great hedges of horſemen, aduanced to giue the generall onſet.</p>
               <p>Then theſe three Princes marching euery one at the forefront of his ſquadron cloſe, firſt went a ſoft pace, then began to gallop, laſt, the watch word being giuen with a looſed bridle, ſet on ſo liuely (euery one ſeuerally by himſelf according to his courſe) vpon that multitude, that incontinently the companies were mingled, and came to handiblowes. The ſpeares which were in great number in the armie of <hi>Ioyeuſe,</hi> did but ſmall ſeruice, for they ioyned néerer.</p>
               <p>It is a wonderfull thing, that in a moment ſuch a furious troupe as was that of the Lord <hi>Ioyeuſe,</hi> armed &amp; furniſhed to the aduantage, flanked both on the right hand and the left with two great battaillions of footmen,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:8966:88"/>
was ouerthrowne and vanquiſhed, by a troupe which had neither in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, nor in furniture, nor in armes, nor in ſituation of the battell any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage at all. God (who gouerneth all things, and holdeth in his hands <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1587. Octob."/> the balance of victories and ouerthrowes) made then courage to preuayle againſt multitude; the iuſt cauſe, againſt iniurie; and the lawfull defence, againſt bragging, and the great preparation of warre.</p>
               <p>And as the men of armes were quickly ouerthrowne, trodden vnder foote, and put to flight; ſo in as little ſpace were the footmen diſcomfited, being ſet on by the regiment of the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> where commaunded as Maſters of the Campe, <hi>Caſtelnaw, Parabiere, Salignake,</hi> and others. And at the left hand of the King of <hi>Nauarre, Charboniere, Preau, Orges,</hi> and others, who all euery man right forward (following the occaſion of the victorie) cut in péeces all that made any reſiſtance, and put to flight the reſt which were on the ſide of copſes at the right hand, as on the ſide of the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer <hi>Droune</hi> at the left hand. And as a little before nine a clocke theſe two armies came to hands, the quarrell was ſo ſoone decided, that at ten a clock there was found not one onely man of the enemies which ſtood to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, nor that was in ſight, but ſuch as were laied dead vpon the ground, or taken priſoners, or in flight. The place where the battell was fought, remayned ſo couered with men of armes, horſes and armours, but ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Launces matted ſo thicke that they ſtopt the way. There remayned the Lord <hi>Ioyeuſe,</hi> and alſo his brother, with a great number and notableſt Lords.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> the Princes of <hi>Conde</hi> and <hi>Soiſſons,</hi> with the reſt of the armie purſued the victorie. There were taken many notable Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and among others the Lord <hi>Belegarde</hi> gouernour of <hi>Xainctonge,</hi> the Lords S. <hi>Luke,</hi> and <hi>Montigny</hi> of <hi>Berry,</hi> who commaunded ouer a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of horſemen: hee was noted in ioyning of the battell to haue pearced further then any of the companie; for hee entered euen to the ſide of the gardes of the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> which were at his right hand, and there by them beaten downe was taken by ſome of the ſayd gardes.</p>
               <p>God gaue this notable victorie to the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> and in that ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney did ſhine the valour wherewith hee hath indued him in all the ſpeciall graces which may decke a noble and vertuous Prince, and great Captain, not onely for the counſell, reſolution, diligence, and wiſe gouernment, but alſo in the execution of armes. For doing the office of a Captaine &amp; Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, he preſſed ſo farre as to take the enemie by the coller.</p>
               <p>The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> alſo ſhewed himſelfe valiant; for he had his horſe ſlaine vnder him; the Prince of <hi>Soiſsons</hi> alſo tooke priſoners with his owne hand. The horſe of the Vicount <hi>Turenne</hi> was alſo ſlaine. God made theſe Princes ſtrong in this dayes worke, according to the order of their prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence, by them to doo the execution which pleaſed him: ſo that euery
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:8966:89"/>
one in his owne perſon did ſome honorable exployt in this victorie. This victorie was the more honorable vnto the ſayd King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> that it was not bloudie to him. For ſo great number being ſlaine on the ſide of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1587. October"/> enemies, he loſt a very ſmall number of either horſemen or footmen of his own. And among that ſmall number, there was not found one of marke or commandement. On the other ſide, all the chiefeſt were ſlaine, wounded or taken, except <hi>Lauerdine,</hi> who ſaued himſelfe with much a doo. Captayne <hi>Mercure</hi> while they were in battaile, ran to <hi>Contras</hi> to ſeaze vpon the king of <hi>Nauarre</hi> his baggage, ſuppoſing that the Duke <hi>Ioyeuſe</hi> had gotten the victorie. But when he heard the crye of victorie for the King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarre,</hi> he went out in haſt, and following the bancke of the riuer <hi>Droune</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Rochechalays,</hi> ſaued himſelfe by flight and ſhame.</p>
               <p>The victorie was purſued three houres and more, in the which purſuing were ſlaine and taken a great number: the ordinance was carried away, and the baggage loſt. After the returne from purſuing of the enemie, thankes were giuen to GOD vpon the place of the battell, the wounded were taken vp, the dead buried, the campe of the enemie burned vp.</p>
               <p>But that which filled the meaſure of the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> his vertue and honour, was, that hee ſhewed himſelfe no leſſe courteous and gentle toward the priſoners and wounded, than hee had ſhewed himſelfe valiant in the fight. Let them who haue tried him by experience, giue the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thereof, who alſo haue acknowledged by effect, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good affection which he beareth to good French men, diſcerning by a wiſe prudence all good men, from the conſpiring and traiterous Leaguers, enemies of the ſtate. He commaunded the wounded to be diligently dreſſed and attended: he ſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way almoſt all the priſoners without any raunſome: he gratified many of the chiefeſt, &amp; to ſome he rendered their Enſignes, namely, vnto the Lord <hi>Montigny.</hi> If he could haue guided the lot of armes in the battell, many were left there vpon the place to whom he would haue willingly forgiuen. For there was ſeene in him in this proſperous ſucceſſe not one token of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolencie or paſſion, which is commonly the mother of crueltie.</p>

               <p>Secondly, that there would enſue an vniuerſall rebellion of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, ſo that the hereticks themſelues, if they would<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (which thing they woulde neuer (carrying alwaies in remembrance the iniuries and maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacars by him committed vppon them) bee able to keepe him in the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his eſtate.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that the holy father, and all other Catholick potentates of Chriſtendome, would take it in very ill part, and would bend their forces againſt him, ſo that <hi>Iupiter</hi> himſelfe woulde not bee able to defende him.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all, that it would dot be honorable for him ſo to doo: for it would be thought, that after the freſh loſſe at <hi>Coutras,</hi> feare had compelled him to yeeld to diſhonorable conditions, and to receaue law of his ſubiects, and ſo againſt the honorable actes of his aunceſtors, hee ſhould ſeeme to haue ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned himſelfe, though not in opinion, yet in ſocietie with the hereticks, and ſo thought not to haue forſaken, yet to haue been himſelfe againſt the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick religion.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, the heathens did neuer giue ſo much credit to the oracles of <hi>Apollo,</hi> as this beſotted King (whome God had endued with good
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:8966:91"/>
partes, if hee would haue vſed them with libertie) did attribute vnto his mother, being vnto him as <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ates fatidica,</hi> and a ſhee Prieſt of <hi>Apollo,</hi> a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1587. Nouemb."/> ſnare, confuſion and ſhame. Shee therefore at the requeſt of the Maſters of the League, ſendeth her Oracle, <hi>ex aurcatripode,</hi> that by no meanes the King ſhould accept the offers of the King of <hi>Nauarre.</hi> Fearing that if the King had receaued the offers aboue ſaide, hauing the Princes of the bloud about him, to helpe by their counſell and wiſdome the eſtabliſhing of the decayed ſtate, ſhee ſhould haue been turned out of gouernement, and de <hi>Ponte Deiecta,</hi> commaunded to ſit at home to mumble her beades. So this great King, yet once more traiterouſlie was be witched, and by the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boueſaid counſellers and Mother, was ſold to his owne ruine, and wofull fall.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> after the victory obtayned at <hi>Coutras,</hi> became not inſolent of the victory, but mooued with compaſſion for the miſeries which afflicted <hi>France,</hi> ſubmitted himſelfe, and ſearching out the means to pacify the troubles, ſent Ambaſſadors to the king the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being on the South ſide the riuer <hi>Loyre</hi> in <hi>Berry,</hi> to require him yet moſt earneſtly and humbly to conſider the pitifull ſtate of his realme, and to pity and remedy the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold oppreſſions of his people. And although they might haue conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his good ſucceſſe for the ſpace of three yeares in beholding ſo great for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and ſtrong armies prepared and ſent agaynſt him, partly to haue vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed away as duſt blowen by the wind, and partly ouerthrowen by the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular aſſiſtance of the mighty God of battels, yet doth proffer with many humble prayers and ſubmiſſion, not onely peace to his diſaduantage, but alſo his forces with the army of the Germans, if it pleaſeth him to vſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to take reuengement of the iniuries, &amp; ſo often reiterated rebellions of the League.</p>
               <p>But the Duke of <hi>Guyze,</hi> head of the League, hearing of this meſſage, &amp; ſeeing himſelfe, his practiſes, hope, and all that euer he had with his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, followers, and companions to be in a dreadfull precipice, like to be thrown down into a miſerable headlong downfall, taketh order by pollicy to deuiſe ſome meanes to auoyd the danger, that is, to worke by all means poſſible to let the accompliſhing of this ambaſſage. And that this thing may be brought to paſſe, the king is to be enchaunted with that kind of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery which in old tyme was called <gap reason="foreign">

Theſe perſons muſt vphold the League, or elſe all wil be ſpilled.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid before how the King with all the forces he could make, gaue his laſt indeuour to oppreſſe the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> and with him them of

               </p>
               <p>The ſecond, the king himſelfe ſhould haue about him in his owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to let the paſſage ouer <hi>Loyre,</hi> leaſt the ſayd Germanes ſhould ioyne with the King of <hi>Nauarre.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third was conducted by the Lord <hi>Ioyeuſe</hi> into <hi>Guienne,</hi> where we ſhewed the ſame to haue beene buried in perpetuall infamie at the battel of <hi>Coutras.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now remayneth to ſpeak of the other two, what they did, and what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came of them.</p>
               <p>The King had in deede gathered mighty armies, but he had no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to maintain them, for the Prieſts would haue no more warre ſo coſtly as they had two yeares before: the Pariſiens would heare no more theſe words, <hi>da mihi, affer mihi:</hi> The Kings money either was intercepted by the way in diuers chances, or elſe his Taliages, Tributs, or ſubſidies were not payed, either by ſome for lack of good wil, or elſe by ſome for lack of money. Therefore in the latter end of Auguſt hauing foure thouſand Swiſſers at <hi>Eſtampes,</hi> and eight thouſand more entring already into <hi>France,</hi> with foure thouſand Rutters, which were euery day expected, he muſt needes prouide money for them.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell had drawen vpon his armes; he gathered a great ſumme of mony vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Courts of his Parl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But whileſt the K. was ſo buſie to fight againſt the God of battells, &amp; his Sonne whome he had anoynted vpon his holy hill Sion; and poll<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>There was a certaine Maſſe Prieſt, Parſon of Saint <hi>Seuerine,</hi> at the lower ende of Saint <hi>Iames</hi> ſtreate, named <hi>Preuoſt,</hi> who preached moſt ſeditiouſly againſt the King and certain other Lords, who were his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſeruaunts, without any reſpect of perſons, degree, or dignitie. This Prieſt being threatned to be had before the King, a certaine notarie made a great aſſembly, both of armes and men for to defend the Prieſt.</p>
               <p>The King being aduertized of this miſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

They which were aſſembled in the Notaries houſe, ſeeing the ſayde company to enter into the houſe, ſet vpon them with great violence, and enforced

               <p>Now to returne to the courſe of the hiſtory: The King hauing three great mighty armyes, and no money to entertaine them, turned him<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Mother,</hi> and gouernd King Henry the ſecond (father to this King) at their pleaſure, when they were diſpoſed to make him a ſlaue to their paſſions. For the ninth of Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the King went to Parliament, for to eſtabliſh fifteene Edicts, among the which there were three notable: the firſt was of the eſtabliſhing 27. Secretaries: The ſecond was to chooſe the ſixt chamber of enqueſts, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of twenty counſellers, and two preſidents. The third was the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the Maſters of accounts, with two preſidents: out of the which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, he made his reckoning to pluck two Millions of golde. Where thou mayeſt ſee (gentle Reader) in what miſerable ſtate <hi>France</hi> was then, from the higheſt to the loweſt. The Leaguers ſecretly agaynſt the king: They openly made warre agaynſt God, diſtroyed his ſubiectes to bring to paſſe his owne ſubuerſion, and to hide the treaſons of his enemies, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to harken vnto any motion of peace proffered him by the king of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> or to any good counſels: and for to maintayne this his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes, iuſtice muſt be peruerted by plurality of offices, which is one of the principalleſt pillers of kingdoms: by the which magiſtracy is vpholden &amp; mans ſociety entertayned.</p>
               <p>As concerning the armies which were in hand, that which ſhould bee lead by the king himſelfe conſiſted of foure ſcore and eight companyes of men of armes, and ten thouſand footmen, twelue thouſand Swiſſers, 4. thouſand Rutters, he caryed twelue double Canons, and two thouſand Pioners, and about the 1. of September the companies began to repayre to <hi>Montereau faut Yoynne,</hi> with commaundement to ſtay there abouts, &amp; about <hi>Sens</hi> in <hi>Bourgony,</hi> vntill his comming, and then to repayre all to S. <hi>Florentine</hi> there to be muſtered.</p>
               <p>The king ſent to Marſhal <hi>Biron</hi> to <hi>Montereau,</hi> to view the place where they ſhould campe: for the king had determined to campe alwayes: and for that cauſe all the Lords had prouided tentes. He tooke for his counſel, the Lords <hi>Villeroy,</hi> and <hi>Bruſlard,</hi> ſecretaries, the Dukes <hi>Eſpernon, Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile, Retes,</hi> and the Marſhals <hi>Biron</hi> and <hi>Aumont.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Prince <hi>Soyſſons</hi> was with the king of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> and the Prince <hi>County,</hi> was in <hi>Norma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dy, Mayne</hi> &amp; <hi>Aniow,</hi> to gather as many companies as he could, to ioyne with the Germans, knowing well, that theſe great ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:8966:92"/>
were ſpecially prouided to deſtroy the houſe of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> vnder the colour of defending the popiſh religion. The Duke <hi>d'Aumaule</hi> was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted Colonel of the Swiſſers: this armie went not further Eaſtward <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1587.

               <p>As for the third armies, thus is it: the Duke of <hi>Guize</hi> &amp; <hi>Lorreyne,</hi> at the beginning of September were at <hi>Nancy,</hi> there they had between 20. and 25000. men, among them were many horſemen, there they receaued 400. Launces of the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> all olde Souldiers, 2000. footemen Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians, and betweene ſixe or ſeauen hundred light horſes, they made no great account of the Italians: the ſonne of the Lord <hi>Antragues,</hi> gouernour of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans,</hi> about the 15. of September brought vnto the Duke of <hi>Guize,</hi> beſide horſemen, about 700. footemen, when a little before, all the companies of the Leaguers of <hi>Britayn,</hi> ſent vnto him by the Duke <hi>Mercure,</hi> vnder the conduct of the Lord <hi>Hault Boys,</hi> were diſcomfited by the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> nigh <hi>Monſoreau,</hi> vpon <hi>Loyre,</hi> as is before reported.</p>
               <p>The army of Germans for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king of <hi>Nauarre</hi> when it departed out of Germany, was of fiue thouſand Rutters, fiue thouſand Launceknights, armed with corſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But after they had paſſed the mountayne of <hi>Sauerne,</hi> the further it went forward, the more it did encreaſe: for the Lord <hi>Mouy</hi> brought two thouſand Harquebuſiers French men on horſbacke. The L. <hi>Villeneufue Cormon</hi> one thouſandand, the Lord <hi>Lours</hi> one thouſand.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Chaſtilion</hi> the 22. of September brought to it fifteene hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered Harquebuſiers, &amp; about 200. horſes, ſo that the totall ſumme myght amount to 34. or 35. thouſand, beſides the companies which the Prince <hi>County</hi> brought afterward.</p>
               <p>They had 16. pieces of ordinance, to wit, foure great culuerines, eight field pieces, and three peeces which were taken from <hi>Salabrine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Lieutenant of the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> was the Prince <hi>Bullion,</hi> aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with a counſel, conſiſting of theſe which follow: the Lordes <hi>Guitri, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neaulx, Cleruan, Beauuoys la Nocle, Vezins, Digoyne, Louet, Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boillet, Laube, Cheuorles, Huguery,</hi> and <hi>Beauuieu.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This army was the terror of the one ſide, and the hope of the other, and yet both were diſappointed of their expectation. For God ſhewed to the one part, that he hath means ynough to chaſtife whom, and when he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth: to the other part hee ſhewed, that they are not ſafe who do truſt in man, and make their force the arme of fleſh.</p>
               <p>Beſide theſe three mighty armies, and the armies of the king of <hi>Nauarre</hi> and <hi>Ioyeuſe,</hi> whereof it is ſpoken before: The Lords <hi>Mommorency</hi> and
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:8966:93"/>
                  <hi>Diguieres</hi> had the fifth in <hi>Daulphine</hi> agaynſt the Lord <hi>Valete,</hi> beſide the armes and aſſembled forces ſcattered elſwhere.</p>
               <p>Such was the ſtate of miſerable <hi>France,</hi> which had great cauſe to grone <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1587 Septemb."/> vnder the heauy burthen of ſo many, ſo great and mighty armies. This tempeſt was very blacke and thicke, and at length thereout iſſued dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full thunder clappes.</p>
               <p>But now we haue to ſpeake of theſe three armyes conioyntly, to wit, of the Leaguers, lead by the <hi>Guyzes:</hi> of the Catholikes, conducted by the king himſelfe: and of the Germans, guided chiefly by the Duke of <hi>Boillon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here we haue to conſider the iudgementes of God, which were powred vpon theſe armies. Firſt, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Leaguers by the K. forces did work y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> K. vndoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by his fall they might be lifted vp on high. The king in pretending y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> defence of the Catholike religion, which no man did oppugne by violence, but the Leaguers, went about to root the Goſpell of Chriſt out of <hi>France.</hi> The Germans for the moſt part were mercenaries, who regarded not the right of the cauſe, neither came to ſerue him, who procured them, but did in mynd ſwallow downe the ſpoyle of <hi>France.</hi> And ſome among them who were lead with an vpright mind, yet being mingled with prophane and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religious men, and truſting in the outward apparance of that army, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned theyr confidence from God to the arme of fleſh: therefore all were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed of theyr intents, for neyther of them all had any benefit by this great warre, but blowes, ſlaughters and calamityes.</p>
               <p>About the latter ende of Auguſt, after this great armie, had paſſed the mountaine of <hi>Zauerne,</hi> and began to enter into <hi>Lorreyne,</hi> the Dukes eldeſt ſonne, with certaine regiments approached ſo nigh them at <hi>Salabrine,</hi> that 3. of his companies were diſcomfited, and ſix Enſignes ſent to <hi>Straſbourg,</hi> and proceeding further they tooke <hi>Blaſmond.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſaid army drawing neere to <hi>Nancy,</hi> about the beginning of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember, certayne ſeruantes going about to forrage with their cartes, were ſet on by certayne companies which iſſued out of <hi>Nancy:</hi> &amp; when they had ſeazed vppon ſome cartes, were purſued and beaten into the very gates of <hi>Nancy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This army of Germans being about <hi>Nancy,</hi> there was a counſell hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, to wit, agaynſt whom they ſhould firſt turne theyr armes.</p>
               <p>The French men were of that aduile, to make warre in <hi>Lorreyne,</hi> and that it was the pleaſure of the king of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> that they who had of luſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes kindled that miſerable warre in <hi>France,</hi> might firſt of all feele the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy burthen of the ſame: but ſpecially the Duke of <hi>Lorreyne,</hi> who was one of the heads of the League.</p>
               <p>The Germans in taking a certaine ſumme of money, which the Duke of <hi>Lorreyne</hi> proffered them, were at length content to paſſe by as neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and friends: yet notwithſtanding they concluded warre, &amp; did there
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:8966:93"/>
many acts of hoſtilitie, ſuch as warre doth commonly drawe after it.</p>
               <p>This armie being yet newe and luſtie, did neglect a notable occaſion to oppreſſe the enemie at the bridge S. <hi>Vincent:</hi> vpon what occaſion that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1587. Septemb."/> was neglected, it is vncertaine. But it is confeſſed of all men, that if they had come to hands that day, they had ſeene the end (by the iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of men) of that warre aſſoone as the beginning. Thus ſome exployts of warre being done there, the ſcarcitie of victualls beginning to growe, they determined to goe foorth out of <hi>Lorreyne.</hi> But vpon the determination of the way which they ſhould followe, there was great difficultie found. For the Germans deſired to paſſe toward <hi>Sedan,</hi> from whence they might hope of many good commodities, and if néede ſhould be they might haue a newe ſupply of forces out of <hi>Germany:</hi> which thing could not bee, if they encloſed themſelues among ſo many riuers which are on the South ſide of <hi>Seyne.</hi> Some French men on the contrary, ſayd, that they ſhould turne right to the riuer of <hi>Loyre,</hi> for to ioyne with the King of <hi>Nauarre.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Boillon</hi> deſired greatly that they would approach to <hi>Sedan,</hi> as they had (as he ſayd) promiſed him, and that in hope of it he had made great preparations of powder and artillerie, which hee had made of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Conſidering alſo that he had to prouide for the ſecuritie of his places, which might incurre ſome daunger if they were not prouided for. All rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons debated and weighed on both ſides, the courſe to the riuer of <hi>Loyre</hi> was concluded.</p>
               <p>Whileſt theſe things ſo paſſed in <hi>Lorreyne,</hi> the Lord <hi>Chaſtilion</hi> the 22. of September came to the armie with his troupes: he had much adoo to paſſe, and was as if it were encloſed in the towne of <hi>Greſille,</hi> but was reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cued by the Countie <hi>de la Mark,</hi> yonger brother to the Duke of <hi>Boillon.</hi> The armie drawing néere to <hi>Chaumont</hi> in <hi>Baſſigny,</hi> there it was put in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation to execute a certaine enterprize which the Lord <hi>Chaſtilion</hi> had in hand; but it could not be done.</p>
               <p>The armie came to <hi>Chasteauuilaine,</hi> where they ſoiorned ſome dayes: and in the meane while they tooke a Gentleman named <hi>Viliers,</hi> comming from <hi>Rome:</hi> his iourney to <hi>Rome</hi> was to ſolicite the Pope to helpe his maſter with money, to make warre againſt them of the reformed religion, and alſo to pray the Pope (Frier <hi>Sixtus)</hi> to name the King head of the League, aſſuring him that it would greatly mooue him to warre, and roote out them of the religion, whom he named heretickes. The anſwere which the Pope made him (as it appeared by his words) was, that they ſhould liue in peace with their neighbours, and that hee could not furniſh them with money, being not willing to make warre againſt any man, who deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red peace among all men.</p>
               <p>The ſayd gentleman carried a letter very ill written, which he ſayd to be the hand of the Ducheſſe of <hi>Lorreyne,</hi> mother of the Duke, contayning
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:8966:94"/>
thus much. I am very glad to vnderſtand the ſtate of your affayres, and I aduiſe you to goe forward, for neuer a fayrer occaſion was offered you to put the Scepter in your hand, and the Crowne vpon your head. This let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1587 Septemb."/> gaue occaſion to them of the Counſell, to agree that this Gentleman ſhould be kept carefully, and brought to the King of <hi>Nauarre.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The armie ſoiourning at <hi>Chasteauuilaine,</hi> the King with his great ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie ſtayed about <hi>Montereau faut Yonne</hi> and <hi>Sens:</hi> but vnderſtanding the determination of the Germans, retyred with his armie into <hi>Berry</hi> beyond <hi>Loyre,</hi> there to ſtop the paſſing ouer to the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> and to giue them freer acceſſe betwéene the two riuers of <hi>Seyne</hi> and <hi>Loyre,</hi> where hée thought either to weary them, or by ioyning his with the armie of the Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guers, at the tayle of them eaſily he might oppreſſe them. During this ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iourne, the Baron <hi>Oneau</hi> brought the artillerie before the Abbey of <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaulx,</hi> which compounded to giue a certaine ſumme of money, and ſome quantitie of wine and meale: notwithſtanding, that capitulation did not hold, becauſe the ſayd Lord <hi>Oneau</hi> had not taken hoſtages for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the ſayd conditions, contenting himſelfe with the faith of the Captaine which was within: but as the armie marched forward he kept not promiſe.</p>
               <p>The armie departing from <hi>Chaſteauuilaine,</hi> made foure dayes iourney to the riuer <hi>Seyne,</hi> where they arriued about the 2. of October, and paſſed ouer the ſayd riuer aboue <hi>Chastilion</hi> vpon <hi>Seyne,</hi> without enterprizing vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the towne, becauſe the Lord of <hi>Guize</hi> had put into it the Lord <hi>Chastre</hi> with a certaine number of horſemen and footmen, which made a ſallie. The Lord <hi>Chastilion</hi> was commaunded to make the rereward with three companies of light horſemen, and ſeauen Cornets of Rutters, and three hundred Harquebuſiers.</p>
               <p>The Colonel <hi>Berbiſtroph</hi> was a little more toward the riuer to fauour the Lord <hi>Chaſtilion:</hi> which thing the Lord <hi>Chaſtre</hi> ſeeing, he made haſt with his horſemen (being fauoured with certaine harquebuſiers which hee had ſet in a coppes) to charge <hi>Berpiſtroph,</hi> who incontinently aduertized the Lord <hi>Chaſtilion,</hi> to the end he might cut off the returne of thoſe horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Lord <hi>Chaſtre:</hi> which thing he did. The ſeauen Cornets which were with the Lord <hi>Chaſtilion,</hi> followed him with a ſhewe of good will to fight: but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming not in time, the Lord <hi>Chaſtilion</hi> (with the Frenchmen) began to charge the harquebuſiers of the garde of the Lord <hi>Chaſtre,</hi> who were all cut to péeces, and the horſemen followed vnto the gates of the towne. One of the Rutters on a ſudden forſaking his band, killed a French Launce with the ſhot of a piſtoll.</p>
               <p>From thence they went to lodge at <hi>Leyne,</hi> where they ſoiourned two dayes. The Germans complayned much of their lodgings. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhalls could not denie but that they had oftentimes ill lodgings: but the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:8966:94"/>
fault was in the deare yeare, as they among the principall Rutters could teſtifie, who in the yeares before in their former voyages, had béen well <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1587. Septemb."/> lodged in the ſelfe ſame lodgings where they were now.</p>
               <p>In the ſame place dyed of ſickneſſe the Countie <hi>de la Mark,</hi> yonger brother to the Duke of <hi>Boillon,</hi> who had hetherto alwayes conducted the auauntgard about the third of October.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Leyne</hi> they remooued to <hi>Anſi le frank,</hi> &amp; to <hi>Taulay,</hi> where newes came that the Duke <hi>de Mayne</hi> was in a Caſtle not farre off. The Baron of <hi>Oneau,</hi> who was lodged nigh the ſaid Caſtle, wrote about it to the ſaid Lord <hi>Chaſtilion,</hi> with a declaration of the good will which the Rutters had to aſſault him, if they would ſend them ſome number of footmen. And if the Duke of <hi>Guize</hi> would haue approached to the right hand of the ſaid Lord <hi>Chaſtilion,</hi> they would come to his ſuccour aſſoone as néede were. There was then a fayre occaſion (as it ſeemed) to enforce the Duke of <hi>Guize</hi> to battell: notwithſtanding, there was found ſome difficulties. For ſome of the countrey ſayd that the Caſtle was ſtrong: others, that it was a wood land fit for the harquebuſiers of the Duke of <hi>Guize,</hi> and diſaduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious for the horſemen of the armie, and that it would bee hard in cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping there to get victuals, and therefore they ſtayed not there.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Anſi</hi> the armie tooke courſe to the riuer of <hi>Yonne,</hi> and came to it the ſecond day after. About the fift of October the ſayd armie paſſed the riuer at <hi>Mally la vile,</hi> where alſo arriued the Lord <hi>Longa</hi> from the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> and willed them in the name of the ſayd King to direct the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie toward the head of the riuer <hi>Loyre,</hi> where he determined to receiue it. Many (notwithſtanding) thought that the Germans would hardly take that way, ſuppoſing that if they ſhould take y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> courſe, many of the Swiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers would diſband themſelues, drawing ſo nigh their countrey, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring alſo that with much adoo the artillerie would paſſe through the <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernoys,</hi> partly by reaſon of the foule wayes, and partly for the great ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie of victuals which would be found in <hi>Niuernoys</hi> and <hi>Moruant.</hi> Vpon this incertitude, the armie marched forward, the reſolution of that matter being referred to the incident occaſions. This thing mooued the Germans to complaine, and to require another gouernment to be vſed in marching. The forme of marching which they deſired, was in forme of a triangle, ſo that the Rutters ſhould make one wing: the other wing toward the ſide of the enemie ſhould be of the Frenchmen, and the middle ſhould be the gard of the artillerie and the Swiſſers, which notwithſtanding was not ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued: then alſo began the diſcommodities to encreaſe in the armie.</p>
               <p>Thus the matters paſſing in that armie doubtfully, and without any reſolution vppon any expedient counſell, at length they determined to trye the paſſage at <hi>Charite,</hi> and for this purpoſe were choſen both horſemen and footmen: but the enterpriſe being delayed off one day for want of ſome
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:8966:95"/>
commoditie, the King had leiſure to ſend thether men of armes, who arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued there at the ſame inſtant when the armie did approach, which gaue oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to retyre without doing any thing. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1587.

               </p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Chaſtilion,</hi> with the Marſhall of the Campe of Rutters, and the Colonell <hi>Boke,</hi> with two thouſand horſes, drewe néere to <hi>Coſnes,</hi> partly to fauour them who were gone to ſeeke paſſage at <hi>Charite</hi> (if neede were) partly to ſeeke occaſion to ſee the enemie. There they miſſed the Duke <hi>Eſpernon</hi> but a little, who had paſſed the riuer at <hi>Neufuy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſame night the ſayd Lord <hi>Eſpernon</hi> ſet vpon the Campe of the footmen, but did very little preuaile, and after that returned to <hi>Coſnes,</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying away with him the Captayne <hi>Bonourier</hi> ſore wounded.</p>
               <p>In the meane while the King with his armie was on the other ſide of the riuer to oppoſe himſelfe to the paſſage: ſo that the day being come, the two armies could ſee one another.</p>
               <p>At euening al the army arriued at the riuer ſide, &amp; that night the K. made great trenches at the foord of <hi>Neufuy,</hi> &amp; fortifyed the ſame with a garriſon of Harquebuziers and Muſketters: and for to fauour them, cauſed 3. great boats well furniſhed with ordinance to bee brought. The riuer of <hi>Loyre</hi> was to be paſſed at foordin many places vntil that time, and there was yet in ſome places foordes, yet had they no meanes to paſſe, becauſe the kings armie kept the bancke of the riuer euery where. If that army had marched ſomewhat ſpeedily, it might haue paſſed well ynough in preuenting the kinges armie which came out of <hi>Paris</hi> ſomewhat late: for the king repoſed himſelfe vppon the aſſurance of the Duke of <hi>Guyze,</hi> who aſſured the ſaid king to ſtop the paſſage of that army, which thing he could not performe, and had not béen done, if the king had not oppoſed himſelfe to them at the banke of the riuer.</p>
               <p>The morrow after, the Lord <hi>Boyllon</hi> came to ſit in counſell at <hi>Neufuy.</hi> There the Lords <hi>Oneau</hi> and <hi>Huguerie</hi> made many complayntes in the name of the Germans, by reaſons of the ſafetyes and exemptions which were giuen as wel to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> popiſh gentlemen as to them of the religion, in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour therof they receaued into their houſes y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> goods of the vilages where y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> army was lodged: and that was true indeede, and therefore required that there might be no more geuen to any man, or elſe that they might be taxed to pay money for the army. They requeſted alſo that they would take or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for the paime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the Rutters for a moneth, which was promiſed them: and for lacke of the ſayd pay, they would goe no further, adding many difficulties concerning the paſſage of <hi>Loyre:</hi> beſide that the winter did draw neere, and that there was but two moneths to keepe the field. They were requeſted patiently to ſtay a while vntill they might aduertize the king of <hi>Nauarre</hi> to know his pleaſure. That in the meane tyme they would goe to ſoiorne in <hi>Beauſſe,</hi> where was great quantity of corne, and of

                  </gap>es, ſo that the armies might there eaſily berefreſhed. As for the pay, it was impoſſible to the French men at that preſent tyme to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1587. Octob."/> furniſh ſo much money, and that drawing into <hi>Beauſſe</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>andomoys,</hi> there ſome money might be had.</p>
               <p>The Germans were contented with that, ſo that ſpeedily they would ſend to the K. of <hi>Nauarre</hi> with promiſe to ſtay vntil they might heare from him.</p>
               <p>They quartered themſelues the next day, and all the army was lodged vpon the lands of the Lord <hi>Chaſtilion,</hi> who offered it willingly, to ſhew example to others to preferre the publike commodities before the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Boillon</hi> lodged at <hi>Chaſtilion</hi> with other noble men, to aduiſe vpon the affaires of that armie.</p>
               <p>Some dayes before, <hi>Tilman</hi> colonell of the regiment of <hi>Bearne,</hi> depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted through ſicknes. <hi>Bouſchet</hi> his Lieutenant wrote a letter to the Lord <hi>Cleruaut</hi> in the name of all the Swiſſers, that they had determined to let the king vnderſtand the cauſes wherfore they were come into <hi>France,</hi> and to that effect would ſend Ambaſſadours to the king. That reſolution ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to many very dangerous: they ſent to him neuertheleſſe.</p>
               <p>The towne of <hi>Bleneau</hi> vpon <hi>Loyne</hi> aboue the towne of <hi>Chastilion</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted the Baron <hi>Oneau:</hi> for which cauſe they forced them, and vpon that occaſion the army ſoiorned 2. dayes about <hi>Chaſtilion.</hi> In the meane time newes came that the Duke of <hi>Guyze</hi> did approach with his forces, and was to lodge about <hi>Chaſteau-renard,</hi> diſtant from <hi>Chaſtilion</hi> three ſmall leagues.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Chastilion</hi> then opened them the meanes which he had, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to encloſe the ſayd Duke of <hi>Guyze:</hi> but many difficultyes were aleaged, which did hinder his enterpriſe: Notwithſtanding, the ſayd Lord <hi>Chasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion</hi> went on horſebacke with twenty horſemen in company euen to the gates of <hi>Chasteau-renard,</hi> and there hauing taken ſome of that place, lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that <hi>Guyze</hi> was gone thence about one houre before, for to ioyne with his brother the Duke <hi>de Mayne,</hi> and that he had lodged in the towne with three hundred horſes onely, and before his going away, had put garriſons in the Caſtell.</p>
               <p>The ſaid Lord <hi>Chaſtilion</hi> brought with him about 25. Harquebuſters on horſebacke, whom he ſent to the Lord <hi>Boillon:</hi> by them he learned (as is aforeſaid) that the Duke of <hi>Guyze</hi> was gone to ioyne with his brother, &amp; that all their Bands were ſo ſcattered here and there in the Vilages about. Some gaue counſell to turne the faces of the army agaynſt the Duke of <hi>Guyze</hi> and his brother; that it was an eaſy thing to force him to battayle, afore that hee ſhould approach neerer to the Kinges army, or to <hi>Montar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis</hi> to fauour one an other: notwithſtanding ſome were of a contrary opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:8966:96"/>
and that it could not be done, but the Lord of <hi>Guyze</hi> would haue know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thereof, and then would hee retyre into ſome ſure and ſafe places, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1587.

               <p>They went to lodge about <hi>Montargis,</hi> leauing the riuer of <hi>Loyne</hi> at their right hand for to get the way to <hi>Beauſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They lodged at <hi>Landon</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>imory,</hi> and other Townes there abouts. This way is mooriſh, broken, foule, and full of quakmiers, where the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons of the Germans and Frenchmen did ſo ſinke, that the Rutters were fayne there to lodge.</p>
               <p>The 27. of October, the Lords of <hi>Guyze, Mayne, Elleufe, Aumall, Barre,</hi> the young <hi>Ianuile,</hi> and the brother of the Lord <hi>Mercure,</hi> with other heads of the League and their forces, which were about fifteene hundred horſes, and fiue thouſand Harquebuſiers went to lodge at <hi>Montargis,</hi> and thereabouts on the Eaſt ſide of the riuer <hi>Loyne,</hi> which running betweene both, let the Germans to goe to them of the League: but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, gaue this aduantage to the Leaguers to paſſe to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> armies ſide when they would, becauſe they had the foordes and bridges at theyr deuotion. This aduantage, with the fauour of the Towne of <hi>Montargis,</hi> and of the Countrie, gaue them occaſion to enterpriſe to ſet vpon <hi>Vimory,</hi> where the Baron <hi>Oneau</hi> was lodged, with ſeuen Cornets of Rutters, that place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not diſtant from <hi>Montargis</hi> aboue a League and a halfe.</p>
               <p>The Enemies arriued at <hi>Vimory</hi> in the end of Supper about ſeuen a clocke at night. The Rutters (the alarum being giuen) do repaire to their Cornets with great ſpeede: and whileſt the enemyes were buſie in the ſtreetes to robbe, the Baron <hi>Oneau</hi> did oftentimes charge as well their horſemen as their footmen: the firſt onſet was vpon the Duke <hi>de Mayne,</hi> who with a good companie of horſemen made head to the Rutters. At this onſet the Rutters did ſo play the men, that many notable gentlemen were left dead vpon the place, as well of the companies of the <hi>Guyze,</hi> as of his brother <hi>de Mayne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Cornet of the Duke <hi>de Mayne,</hi> with the gentleman that carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, <hi>Rowray</hi> of <hi>Burgondy</hi> was taken. There were two other Cornets ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, whereof one was of the Lord <hi>Bordeſiere.</hi> The Duke <hi>de Mayne</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued two ſhot of Piſtoll within his armor, whereof hee was ſo amazed, that hee came not to himſelfe vntil the morrow after about eight a clocke.
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:8966:96"/>
There is no doubt but the League would haue had much adoe, if it had not been for a great rayne, darkenes and thunder, which on a ſudden came and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1587.

The League loſt there aboue fortye gentlemen notable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, among whom was the Marques <hi>d'Arques,</hi> eldeſt ſon to the Lord <hi>Liſtenay,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Cigoigne,</hi> ſonne to the Duches <hi>de Mayne,</hi> and others were ſore wounded.</p>
               <p>The Rutters loſt aboue fifty men, about one hundred ſeruing men, &amp; three hundred wagon horſes: they loſt three Cornets of their ſeruantes, wherein were painted the Starre, the Horſe-comb, and the Sponge.</p>
               <p>The Baron <hi>Oneau</hi> receaued a blow with a ſword vpon the forehead, but he was ſhortly after whole.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Chaſtilion</hi> was lodged three leagues from that place, who vnderſtanding of the alarum, went on horſebacke, as alſo others in other places, where the rumor came.</p>
               <p>The ſayd Lord <hi>Chaſtilion</hi> went into the Uillage where hee found ſome of the enemies wandering, whom he tooke there: he noted a great number of dead men, but more Frenchmen then Germans.</p>
               <p>The morrow after the <hi>Guyze</hi> ſent to aſke for the dead, which were aboue two hundred in number, he ſent alſo to know of the Rutters whether they would be content to exchaunge their Cornets and priſoners. They an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that as for the priſoners, they would aduiſe vpon that matter but for the Cornets they would ſend them to the king.</p>
               <p>That day the Baron <hi>Oneau,</hi> who had kept poſſeſſion of their lodgings, ſending all night for the regiment of Lance-knights, went to preſent him ſelfe in battell aray before <hi>Montargis,</hi> where hee was more then an hower to draw the enemies to battell: but no man appeared, and therefore hee retyred.</p>
               <p>The ſame day the artillery in going forward, came within a league of <hi>Montargis,</hi> where it was in no ſmall danger, being ſo nigh the enemy, with a ſmall company: the which after the Lord <hi>Chaſtilion</hi> had found in that caſe, hee accompanyed the ſame vntill two howers within night: and not able to goe further, they vnſtalled it to ſend the horſes to baite in the next Uillages. The ſaid Lord <hi>Chaſtilion</hi> left fifty Harquebuſiers on horſebacke to keepe all night.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Chaſtilion</hi> arryued at his lodging, learned by a Trompet which had béene in the kinges camp, the ouerthrow of the Duke <hi>Ioyeuſe,</hi> and of the proſperous ſucceſſe of the king of <hi>Nauarre</hi> in the battel at <hi>Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tras,</hi> whereof all the court made a great mourning.</p>
               <p>The 30. of October there was a great mutiny of the Rutters, partly for the loſſe which they had at <hi>Vimory,</hi> and partly becauſe they were denied to enter into <hi>Chasteaulandon,</hi> which was appointed for their lodging. The Baron <hi>Oneau</hi> had much adoo to pacify them: but when the Lord <hi>Chaſtilio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>During which exployt, the Duke of <hi>Boillon,</hi> accompanied with many other Lords, came to the Rutters vpon their mutinie. There they ſayd that they would not paſſe further, and that they were lead to the ſlaughter, that they were lodged at the face of the enemie, without any Frenchmen to garde them. They alleaged that it was reported the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> to bee dead in the ouerthrowing of <hi>Ioyeuſe,</hi> that they had loſt part of their baggage, that their ſeruants demanded their wages, and threatned to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake them if they had no money. To be ſhort, they ſayd they had no means to followe, and therefore required to haue leaue.</p>
               <p>The Swiſſers did helpe much to appeaſe that mutinie, ſhewing the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance which they had entred into nigh <hi>Chasteauuilaine,</hi> promiſing each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neuer to part aſunder vntill the warre were ended.

               <p>When the Counſell had made an ende of their ſitting, there came a yong man names <hi>Pau,</hi> ſaying, that he had to ſpeake with the Lord <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaut,</hi> to whom he had heretofore brought letters from the King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarre:</hi> this yong man had alreadie come three or foure times in the army, ſaying, that he would bring to them his regiment which he had in the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie of <hi>Guize,</hi> that hee had not aſſembled it for any other end then for the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> his ſeruice, and that in taking his part he would doo him, beſide ſome peece of notable ſeruice in ſeazing vpon ſome place, and that he had good meanes in <hi>Bourgondy,</hi> but the armie had not fauoured him. That now they might take <hi>Montargis,</hi> as hee had informed them, when they camped at <hi>Chastilion.</hi> That he had his companie in the Caſtle, which the Lord of <hi>Guize</hi> had put in for his ſafetie when he lodged there: but now when the armie marched, the Duke of <hi>Guize</hi> went aſide of them ſtill on the other ſide of the riuer <hi>Loyne,</hi> and that he preſſed him with his company to come to méete him, and that he could not diſobey any longer: therefore let them ſpeedily take aduiſe.</p>
               <p>After ſome ſpeeches had on both ſides, the Lord <hi>Chaſtilion</hi> anſwered him, that all that came from the Duke of <hi>Guize</hi> was ſuſpected to him. Notwithſtanding, that if hee would doo as they would ſhewe him, they would ſend thether. <hi>Pau</hi> anſwered, that there he was to doo all that they ſhould commaund him.</p>
               <p>The matter being reaſoned, they determined to ſend the Lord <hi>Cleruaut</hi> with two hundred harquebuziers and two Cornets of Rutters to execute that enterpriſe. When they came to the place, the Lords <hi>Cleruaut</hi> &amp; <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilion,</hi> and others of the companie, called <hi>Pau</hi> vnto them, and after they
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:8966:97"/>
had ſent to viſite the Caſtle, they put fiftie harquebuſiers vpon the gate: and as they were about to enter in, one of the companie of the Lord <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilion</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1587. Octob."/> warned him that there was treaſon: vpon which occaſion he rety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſpeedily his men: which thing the enemies ſeeing, and that they were diſcouered, they played their parts, and did blowe vp the gate and bridge through which our men ſhould haue entered. In returning from this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe, they who had auoyded ſuch daunger (for to haue beleeued a tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the League) gaue hartie thankes vnto God. Whileſt theſe things did ſo paſſe at <hi>Montargis,</hi> the Lord <hi>Boillon,</hi> with the reſt of the Counſell, had arriued at <hi>Chasteaulandon,</hi> and ſent the ordinance, hauing conſidered where it ſhould bee placed: but becauſe there were neither Swiſſers nor Launce-knights to garde it, the charge was committed to the Lord <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilion,</hi> after his returne from <hi>Montargis,</hi> who began the batterie about two of the clocke. Then the heads of the armie arriued, and in the euening they ſhewed countenance to giue the aſſault. They within rendered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues with their liues ſafe.</p>
               <p>For to keepe the lodgings to the Rutters, and to auoyde confuſion, the Lord <hi>Chaſtilion</hi> would not ſuffer any companies to enter in, but ſent in ſome gentlemen to keepe it for the Rutters, and ſent to the Baron <hi>Oneau</hi> to come very early; which thing he did not. And becauſe the Lord <hi>Chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion</hi> had to doo with Germans, Swiſſers and Frenchmen, he could not kéepe them from ſpoyling the Caſtle: but notwithſtanſting, what could be had in money from the Souldiers, it was giuen to the Baron <hi>Oneau</hi> for the Rutters. There was much ſpoyle in that quarter, for the Rutters put fire in euery village where they had lodged.</p>
               <p>From thence they went to lodge along the riuer which goeth to <hi>Eſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes.</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Nouemb."/> Whileſt they were there, <hi>Bouſchet</hi> and others, who were ſent to the King by the Swiſſers, returned to the armie about the beginning of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uember. Their anſwer was, that the King had commanded them to ſpeake to the Duke of <hi>Neuers,</hi> who had ſhewed them the wrong that they did to their ancient aliance which they had with the King, ſo to beare armes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him; he ſhewed them the danger wherein they put their Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth to be troubled, by the occaſion which they had giuen him to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber their enterprize: but that they might eaſily remedie it, by retyring themſelues from ſo many diſcommodities and neceſſities whereunto they were reduced. Alſo, that if they would determine to retyre home, he would make meanes to the King in their behalfe to giue them money, with all the ſecuritie which they might aſke. Alſo, that after hee had ſo ſpoken to them, the ſayd Lord of <hi>Neuers</hi> brought them to the King, who ſhewed them a very angrie countenance, reproouing them very ſharply for the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence done againſt their aliance and their othes, ſo to arme themſelues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. That it was he which was King of <hi>France,</hi> that he did weare
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:8966:98"/>
the crowne vpon his head, that hee was not a ſpirit, that it was hee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe who ventured both his perſon and all his meanes againſt them who had imployed their forces: he thought that they had béene circumuented <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1587. Nouemb."/> vnder a falſe pretence, but now when they ſaw it they could not pretend any ignorance: hee aſſured them alſo that hee would ſee them purſued by the way of iuſtice before theyr Lords.</p>
               <p>To theſe things they are reported to haue anſwered, that they had borne theſe armes to ſupport the crowne of <hi>France,</hi> and to oppoſe themſelues to the wicked practiſes of the Leaguers, whom his Maieſtie heretofore both by words of mouth, and alſo by his edicts had declared his enemies. And that beeing euery way dulye informed of the truth of this matter, they could do no leſſe, then to ſatiſfy the iuſt requeſt of the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> firſt Prince of the bloud, who was moſt faythfull vnto him, for to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie him in ſuch a iuſt quarell. They ſaid alſo, that they added all which they thought might haue ſerued for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding whether they were amazed at the word of the King, whether they were already wonne by money, at their returne they chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the mindes of their felowes, who then openly began to mutiny, and to aſke two or three moneths wages, or elſe to haue leaue to depart.</p>
               <p>The Baron <hi>Oneau,</hi> with all the Colonels, emploied them ſelues very faithfully, ſhewing them what wrong they did to themſelues, and to their nation, to picke quarrels for to ſeparat themſelues from them, and the Frenchmen, which they could not do with a good conſcience.</p>
               <p>The morrow after the Duke <hi>Boyllon,</hi> with the Baron <hi>Oneau,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Lords ofthe Counſel, went to the quarter of the Swiſſers, to ſee how to remedy that diſorder. The matter was pleaded with many wordes, but at that time there was nothing done. The Colonels and Captaines determined to ſend once more to the king, to haue paſportes to ſend to the king of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> to know to know of him whether he did beare armes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the crown of <hi>France:</hi> and that if he ſhould deny it, they would ſerue him for money: if to the contrary, they would take their leaue from him, with entreatie to be content with that which is paſt.</p>
               <p>This anſwer was receaued as wordes, for they themſelues were ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently enformed of the good and right affection of the king of <hi>Nauarre</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes the king, his crowne, and eſtate: and though they had not knowen it, yet was it not time now to enquire thereof. This anſwere alſo was not regarded, but that they made this quarrell, mooued from ſome where elſe. The alleaged alſo their neceſſityes, and that without money they would not paſſe further.</p>
               <p>As theſe thinges paſſed in the army, they of <hi>Estempes</hi> made a ſally by night vpon the Swiſſers, but without any notable effect.</p>
               <p>At the ſame time the enemyes gaue an onſet vpon the footmen: but by
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:8966:98"/>
reaſon they were ſuccored by the Lord <hi>Chaſtilion,</hi> they did but a litle hurt, ſaue that they tooke priſoner the Lord <hi>Cormon,</hi> who was incontiuently brought to the Duke <hi>Eſpernon:</hi> they vſed him to bring to paſſe that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1587.

               <p>The 15. of Nouember the army remoued toward <hi>Chartres,</hi> and there was put in queſtion whether they ſhould proceed further or returne backe: it was agreed that they ſhould make one dayes march yet further, to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour the comming of the Prince <hi>County,</hi> of whom they had newes by the Lord <hi>Eſſars,</hi> who had ſeene him in returning from the king of <hi>Nauarre.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next lodging was within two litle Leagues of <hi>Chartres:</hi> the Duke <hi>Eſpernon</hi> with the kinges aduangard was at <hi>Bonauall,</hi> which was the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly paſſage which reſted for the armie to paſſe, if they would haue gone fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther along the riuer of <hi>Loyre:</hi> from thence departed the Lord <hi>Chaſtilion</hi> by the common conſent of all to goe to receaue the Prince <hi>County,</hi> who came the 20. of Nouember to <hi>Prunay,</hi> where all the Nobles came to meets him.</p>
               <p>There they repreſented vnto him all the great diſcommodities which they ſuffered. For the king was on the one ſide vpon the border of <hi>Loyre,</hi> the Leaguers were on the right hand of them, and if the army would turne backe, they muſtrepaſſe the way they came, and fighting with the Duke of <hi>Guyze</hi> on the one ſide, they ſhould haue the kings army at their héeles. All reaſons wayghed, it was concluded to returne backe as ſpeedily as might bee, and with great iourueyes to recouer the head ſpring of <hi>Loyre.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some of the Germans thought good at midnight next folowing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, and propoſed it in the Counſell by <hi>Huguery<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>:</hi> but on the one ſide the way was not yetreſolued: on the other ſide they had no tyme to aduertize the whole army: and alſo it was not thought honorable to depart in the night, as though they had béen carryed away with terror. The departing therefore was deferred vntill the 24. of Nouember, and that it ſhould bee by day.</p>
               <p>Whileſt theſe thinges were a dooing, the meſſengers of the Swiſſers returned, and gaue to vnderſtand, that at this third time they had found ſome alteration in the diſcourſe hee had with them, and that the king had commaunded them to repayre to the Duke <hi>Eſpernon:</hi> ſo that it ſeemed by theyr diſcourſe, that they were aſhamed that euer they were entered into any negotiation with the King: ſo there was ſome hope to ſtay them.</p>
               <p>To the ſame end <hi>Huguerie</hi> was ſent to the Baron <hi>Oneau,</hi> to propoſe that it was neceſſary for the contentation of the Germans, to trye by all meanes to ſtay the Swiſſers: it was alleaged for a principall reaſon, that the ſame huge body going away, would cary with them ſome compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Rutters, who might moue the others, and render them more vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:8966:99" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to do that which they were requeſted.</p>
               <p>The matter being propoſed in the counſell, ſome thought theyr depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be not greatly hurtfull, bringing theſe reaſons to verify their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1587. Nouemb."/> firſt, that it was a bodie ſo heauy and ſo vnwealdye to remooue, that by this action the enemy might driue the whole armie into ſome diſaduanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious ſtreight. For without that heauie trou <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>they might more eaſily get the height of the riuer <hi>Loyre,</hi> which was the onely ſure way which the army could take.</p>
               <p>The other on the contrary ſhewed, that ſuch ſeparation could not be done with out great alteration in the reſt of the armie, and that if it were not let, it would bee the beginning of a diſſipation, which was like to haue an euill end, and that the Germans would do the like at the leaſt occaſion, and that with the Swiſſers they were able to beat the kings power: which thing they could not do without their aide. The K. of <hi>Nauarre</hi> had ſhewed what ſhould be done in ſuch extremity, to wit, to turne their faces toward the Duke of <hi>Guyze,</hi> to enforce him to fight, or elſe to encloſe him in what ſoeuer place he were: which thing did not ſeeme very hard, conſidering that he had no good towne to make his retrait vnto.</p>
               <p>That the Swiſſers would not refuſe to fight againſt the League, and vnto all theſe thinges aboue ſaid, would helpe much the proſperous victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which God had giuen to the king of <hi>Nauarre:</hi> but the Swiſſers could not be kept, hauing ſo far dealt with the king.</p>
               <p>They vpon the reſolution to depart, required their Rowles to be ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, to that end that the bodies being aſunder, the affections might remaine ioyned together: and that in ſo doing, they would be ſworne to promiſe to bring to the king of <hi>Nauarre</hi> two or three regiments of Swiſſers at the time and tearme prefixed.</p>
               <p>The counſell ſtood vpon a letter which the Baron of <hi>Oneau</hi> had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, by the which he warned them, that if they gaue aſſurance of pay to the Swiſſers, who contrary to their duty did forſake the ſeruice of their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, they ſhould put no difference betweene the good ſeruitors and the bad.</p>
               <p>The day for the army to depart, which was appointed the 24. being come, the Duke of <hi>Guyze</hi> either of his owne motion, or elſe by intelligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, marched all Night, and put certaine Harquebuziers into a Caſtell, which was at <hi>Aulneau,</hi> where certayne countreymen had repaired, and had agreed with the Rutters to furniſh them with all that they needed.</p>
               <p>The gardes of the Baron <hi>Oneau,</hi> who was lodged at <hi>Aulneau,</hi> a little towne encloſed, did not perceaue the ſaid Harquebuſiers.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Guize</hi> with the reſt of his troups, ſtayed till the day brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, when the wagons of the Rutters began to goe forth, and the gardes were taken vp for to depart: that hower ſeemed vnto him moſt fit to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize

the ſayd Rutters, whom otherwiſe he durſt not aſſault. Hauing geuen the watchword, they entered into the gates, which they found open, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1587.

               <p>The Rutters vppon the alarum, tooke horſe, and found the gate ſeazed vpon, and the ſtreetes hampered with their wagons, ſo that they could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ioyne together to take the field.</p>
               <p>The Baron <hi>Oneau</hi> with ſixe or ſeauen, being the firſt at the gate, pear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced through them which came in. The gate was quickly ſhut. They of the Rutters which had got on horſebacke, ran about the walles to finde a way to get out: and when they found none, ſtanding on the horſe ſaddle, leaped vp the wall, and ſo threwe themſelues into the ditch, where ſome ſaued the Colonels Cornet, and fiue others: but all the Gentlemen of all theſe Cornets were for the moſt part taken, or ſlaine.</p>
               <p>The Baron <hi>Oneau</hi> with the reſt of the Rutters, ſtayed within halfe a league of the Towne.

The Lords <hi>Cleruant</hi> and <hi>Chaſtilion</hi> were ſent to the Rutters to comfort them about their loſſe, and to cauſe them to followe the way. But the morrowe after the Colonels were moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to mutinie, ſaying, that they would goe to the Swiſſers, and ſo with them into <hi>Germanie,</hi> and cauſe their wagons to turne that way.

               </p>
               <p>Vpon theſe perſwaſions they agreed to followe the next day to the <hi>ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des vout,</hi> where they ſayd they would ſee the Frenchmen, and that there they would entreate of all things.</p>
               <p>A certaine man, a friend of the Lord <hi>Chaſtilion,</hi> had ſent word vnto him from the Kings armie that he had waightie things to tell him. The ſayd Lord <hi>Chaſtilion</hi> had ſhewed the letter to the Lord <hi>Boillon</hi> and the reſt of

               <p>There was ſome aparance of danger, leaſt the armie ſhould be purſued by the King and the Leaguers ioyned together, which was the cauſe that it was propounded to the Rutters to burne their wagons, and to ſet as many as they could on horſebacke, promiſing that the Frenchmen ſhould doo the like.

               <p>The <hi>rendes vous</hi> on the next day was at <hi>Landon,</hi> foure leagues from <hi>Montargis,</hi> an vnfit place, by reaſon of a bridge which is in the middle of the Towne, where was great confuſion in going ouer.

About 25. horſemen did all that.</p>
               <p>The Launce-knights did retyre in good order toward <hi>Buiſſiere,</hi> as alſo the wagon men with their horſes, and other ſuch ſtuffe as they could ſaue.

               <p>The ſame long ſoiorning which the Lord <hi>Chaſtilion</hi> made at <hi>Buiſſiere,</hi> gaue time to the enemie to followe him; ſo that in marching the high way
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:8966:100"/>
to <hi>Bouuy,</hi> the enemy appeared marching along the parke: at whoſe diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1587. Nouemb."/> hee put his companie in battell aray foure and foure, by reaſon of the narrownes of the place.</p>
               <p>The Lords <hi>Morinault</hi> and S. <hi>Albine</hi> did leade the forerunners, who diſcouering that the enemie was of more then two hundred horſes, ſent word to the Lord <hi>Chaſtilion,</hi> who ſtrengthened them of ten men of armes which were with the Lord <hi>Byramont,</hi> and willed them to march a ſmall pace after the companies. But a little after they were ſo preſſed, that they turned their faces againſt the enemie with ſword in hand, who then ſtaied, and after in that manner followed the Lord <hi>Chaſtilion</hi> more than three leagues.</p>
               <p>The ſaid Lord <hi>Chaſtilion</hi> geuing to vnderſtand to the Prince <hi>County,</hi> that the enemy was at hand: the Duke <hi>Boyllon</hi> went backe to the ſaid Lord <hi>Chaſtilion,</hi> with 2. hundred horſes: and going backe to a litle brooke which they had left behind, thought good to ſtay there for the enemie: but the Lord <hi>Monluet</hi> (who alwaies had remained behind) gaue to vnderſtand to the Lord <hi>Chaſtilion,</hi> that he doubted ſomewhat: and for to know better what it might be, they went toward the enemies, and at the diſcouering of them, began to ſpeake either to ſtay them, or elſe to make them come nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, but at length the enemy began to retire: vpon which occaſion the Lord <hi>Monluet</hi> and <hi>Chaſtilion</hi> preſſed them ſo farre, that they purſued, beating them beyond the Brooke, where they left dead of the enemie ſeuen or eight vpon the place.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Chaſtilion</hi> purſuing the diſorder of the enemie, was aduerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by the Lord <hi>Boillon,</hi> that the Rutters were more then fiue leagues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with the reſt of the Frenchmen, &amp; that the companies which he purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed was the whole power of the enemie, where were the Lords <hi>Eſpernon, Nemours,</hi> and <hi>Mercure,</hi> &amp; that neceſſity required to march forward with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any further delay: which thing ſtaied the Lord <hi>Chaſtilion,</hi> who in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning paſſed by a little wood, where he ſpied about foure ſcore Harquebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziers of the enemie, who hid themſelues in the ſaid Wood, whom the ſaid Lord <hi>Chaſtilion</hi> made countenance to charge, that in the meane time hee hee might retire his forerunners, whom the ſaid Harquebuziers made their rekoning to ſurprize in theyr returne: but they came againe without any damage.</p>
               <p>The truth is, that there was in all thoſe troupes but onely the Dukes <hi>Eſpernon, Nemours,</hi> and <hi>Mercure,</hi> who were greatly amazed when their forerunners ſo fearefully did caſt themſelues in their armes.</p>
               <p>That ſame day they went to lodge fiue leagues from thence, and the next day they began to enter into <hi>Moruaut,</hi> which is a wood land, and ſo thicke, that with much adoo they could not goe aboue two and two.</p>
               <p>They appointed the <hi>rendes vous</hi> for the chiefe of the army, to heare what
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:8966:101"/>
commiſſion the Lord <hi>Cormon</hi> had brought: which was, that the King would geue ſuch ſurety vnto the Germans as they would, to retire into <hi>Germany,</hi> and to the French men Papiſts (who would liue Popiſhlie in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1587 Nouemb."/> their houſes) ſafetie with their goods. Others of the religion which would retire out of <hi>France,</hi> might enioy their goods, ſo that they would beare no armes againſt him: requiring furthermore in token of their obedience and good intentes, by the which they had declared to haue borne armes onely for his ſeruice, that all the French men ſhould ſurrender him their Cornets and Colours.</p>
               <p>All theſe thinges being debated on both ſides, it was aduiſed not to diſpiſe theſe offers, but for the ſureties and enſignes to take further ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe.</p>
               <p>The reaſons which induced them, were the great amazednes wherein the whole armie was, and to that feare there was ſuch negligence ioyned, that there was no more meanes to keepe any order, neither among the Germans nor Frenchmen. Many French gentlemen had and did dayly reſort home: there was no aſſurance that any great number would ſtay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny longer. There was no reſolution to fight againſt the enemy: the wayes were full of ſtuffe and armes, as well of Germans as Frenchmen, the Horſes were weary, they had to make long iourneys to goe farre from the enemy: when they came, they found no guide to lead them the way to the Vilages, ſo that they trauelled ſome time one or two leagues after they were arriued at the <hi>rendes vous</hi> for to take their lodginges. The moſt part of them remayned either in the woods, or elſe in the firſt houſes which they met: men without bread; horſes without fodder: many horſes were tyred for lacke of ſhooing. There was foure daies iourney to goe through woods.</p>
               <p>The Harquebuziers and footmen did diminiſh on both ſides: all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the Lord <hi>Villeneufue</hi> had diſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>They whom the Lord <hi>Chaſtilion</hi> had brought out of <hi>Languedock,</hi> for lacke of horſes could not follow, or elſe for to follow in ſo long iourneyes were inforced to caſt away their armors: moſt of them had no powder, nor meanes to recouer any. Their Peeces were either broken or vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for lacke of workemen to mend them. There remayned not aboue two hundred Harquebuziers.</p>
               <p>They which reſted of Launce-knights, being about two thouſand, were vnarmed: all theſe reaſons made them conclude, that it was better to ſaue the men to do ſeruice another time, then to looſe them and geue the praiſe to the enemy, to haue wholly deſtroyed that army.</p>
               <p>Vpon theſe deliberations, they diſpatched to the king the L. <hi>Cormon:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="189" facs="tcp:8966:101"/>
In the meane while the army went forward, followed ſtill by the Lord <hi>Eſpernon,</hi> accompanied with ſeuen or eight hundred horſemen, and with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1587. Decemb."/> as many Harquebuſiers as he could put on horſebacke, and was then with in a league of the army.</p>
               <p>The Armie marched fiue daies iourney vnto the towne of <hi>Lancy</hi> in <hi>Maſconoys,</hi> where the <hi>rendes vous</hi> was geuen. The Rutters and French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men aſſembled themſelues the 6. day of December. The Lords <hi>Cormon, Liſle,</hi> and <hi>Moriuault</hi> came from the Lord <hi>Eſpernon:</hi> there the heads and the troupes being aſſembled, conferred together of the things which were to be entreated.</p>
               <p>The king fearing greatly that the remnant of that army ſhould eſcape into <hi>Viuarets</hi> and <hi>Languedock,</hi> &amp; ſo into <hi>Gaſcoyne</hi> to the king of <hi>Nauarre.</hi> Therefore they inuented ſurmiſes to increaſe the terror and impoſſibility, to diuert them (if it were poſſible) from going that way, which they ſaw was the eaſyeſt and ſafeſt to eſcape the danger into the which they did caſt themſelues, and to cauſe them to accept of diſauantagious offers.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Liſle Moriuault</hi> (being ſent by the Duke <hi>Eſperno<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>)</hi> opened a rowle, in the which was read how many companies of armed men and regimentes of footmen were in the forreſt countrey to ſtop the way to the armie, if they ſhould take their iourney to <hi>Viuarets:</hi> he reported alſo how <hi>Mandelot</hi> was enforced to retire his armie, by reaſon of the great Snowes which were fallen there, ſo that there was no meanes for them to paſſe: this thing diſcoraged the army greatly.</p>
               <p>Vpon this deliberation appointed to determine what was to bee done: the Lord <hi>Chaſtilion</hi> ſhewed that the hardeſt &amp; moſt dangerous part of the Forreſt was paſt alreadie, that within foure daies they could bee in a place of ſafetye, and ſhewed them to the eye the mountains of <hi>Viuarets,</hi> where within 24. howers they might haue the Lord <hi>Chebault</hi> with fifteene hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Harquebuſiers: that he knew well the meanes of <hi>Mandelot,</hi> how that he could not gather ſuch companies as could be able to ſtop their way: he warned them to take heed of rumors which were ſpread abroad by the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie to terrify them: offered vpon his life to conduct the companies into <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iuarets</hi> without danger. The meanes which he propoſed, were to deuide the army into two partes, to put one halfe of the Rutters and Frenchmen in the vaungard, with as much of the ſtuffe as was neceſſary, &amp; that which they could not ſpare, and to cut off all the reſt, but ſpecially all the tired horſes which ſerued for nothing but for lets.</p>
               <p>The other halfe of the armie ſhould march after, and that they ſhould reſolue themſelues to fight againſt whomſoeuer would oppoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in their way, either afore or behind. And that in ſo doing he truſted by Gods power, that they might ouercome all impediments which might be proffered: conſidering that God had plucked the armie, as if it were by
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:8966:102"/>
the hand, out of more and farre greater daungers, then they which remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned behinde. Thereunto he added, that the Lord <hi>Eſpernon</hi> was left a long dayes iourney behinde the armie, <hi>Guize</hi> thrée dayes iourney, the King <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1587. Decemb."/> was beyond the riuer <hi>Loyre,</hi> and that before the armie there was nothing which might doo hurt. He ſhewed furthermore, that there was no cauſe to accept the diſaduantagious and vnhoneſt conditions which were offered, vnworthie to bee accepted of them who profeſſed the true Chriſtian refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med religion. On the other ſide, he ſhewed the ſmall aſſurance which they might haue of the Kings proffers, and the impoſſibilitie to returne home in ſafetie the way which they determined to take.</p>
               <p>For firſt, the King did offer ſafetie to retyre whereſoeuer they would, with aſſurance of enioying their goods, as well to them who would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payre to their houſes and liue according to the Romiſh religion, as to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who would retyre out of <hi>France,</hi> to liue in freedome of conſcience without bearing of armes. He did offer alſo ſafetie to the ſtraungers, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payre to their countrey with their Cornets and Enſignes, requiring one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Colours of the Frenchmen. But now he altereth theſe conditions, and will giue no ſuretie to returne home, nor libertie to enioy their goods, but onely to them who will liue after the Popiſh manner, or would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe neuer to beare armes, except by his expreſſe commandement: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide aſked all the Cornets and Colours indifferently as well of the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans as Frenchmen.</p>
               <p>This alteration made him thinke that there was ſome falſe dealing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in the armie it ſelfe, which gaue occaſion to the King to reuoke his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer proffers, and to offer harder: conſidering that it was not vnknowne that the Lord <hi>Eſpernon</hi> hath not at this preſent time fiue hundred horſes, and not ſo many harquebuſiers on horſebacke: ſo that if he would ſtay for them which be had on foote, he would neuer ouertake the armie going for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. But if he ſhould come with them which he had, he would be ſtill the weaker, and himſelfe as wearie, as the armie in danger ſtill to be well bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten: hauing no reaſon that hee ſhould doo ſo now, ſeeing that hee durſt not doo it when he had greater forces néerer the armie, and in a countrie fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to him euery way. He concluded therefore, that there was nothing ſo ſure for the armie as to paſſe the <hi>Loyre.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He ſhewed alſo, that it was impoſſible to returne into <hi>Germany</hi> ſafely: for to goe thether they ought to paſſe the riuer <hi>Saoſne,</hi> and that ſtill vpon bridges, becauſe it cannot bee paſſed by foor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> any where. He ſhewed that the bridges and boates were in the power of the Duke <hi>de Mayne,</hi> and that if the <hi>Saoſne</hi> might be paſſed, yet muſt they go through the enemies lands, ſo that they muſt needes commit themſelues into the Leaguers mercie, whoſe crueltie he knewe the King himſelfe were not able to ſtay. Many Germans and others ſhewed that they approoued well this aduiſe as the
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:8966:102"/>
ſureſt way. But this is to be confeſſed, that God would not vſe the means of this armie, and that he would wholly ſcatter it. For although they ſawe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1587. Decemb."/> and approoued the moſt expedient reaſons, yet they could not follow them. Others thought, that they who would returne into <hi>Languedock,</hi> would haue others to followe them for to aſſure their way. Others alleaged the impoſſibilitie by reaſon of the Snowes: others, the barrennes of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, where they ſhould finde foode neither for men nor horſes. The Rut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters thought vppon the loſſe of their horſes, when they ſhould paſſe the downefalls of the mountaynes of <hi>Viuarets,</hi> where the countrey men alone were able to reſiſt them: ſo that eaſily they were withdrawne from that voiage. For then the common ſort of them without their Colonels flocked together, to heare what the Lord <hi>Liſle mariualt</hi> would ſay, who (perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to diminiſh ſomewhat of the conditions) propoſed vnto them, or els to carrie away their Cornets, and ſweare neuer to returne into <hi>France,</hi> except it were for the Kings ſeruice, or the Emperour: or els to ſurrender their Cornets and to goe with libertie, and to returne when they would.</p>
               <p>Upon this propoſition, the Lord <hi>Chaſtilion</hi> breaking through y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> preace, ſhewed that the Lord <hi>Liſle mariuault</hi> had no authoritie nor writ to treate with them, nor that could binde the King to entertaine that which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed: he ſhewed alſo, how in all that there was no ſecuritie, and that the Kings offer was as good as nothing, in offering to men of warre &amp; Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers conditions ſhamefull and vnreaſonable, and ſuch as could not bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, without forcing both their religion and honour. But the tumult encreaſing (as is commonly ſeene in ſuch diuerſitie of opinions) the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans concluded to accept one of the two proffers, and that ſame day at euening they would ſhew which of them. Upon this reſolution, the Prince <hi>County</hi> with his white Cornet ſeparated himſelfe, and went to lodge at a Caſtle not farre off. They made ſome proffers to the Lord <hi>Chaſtilion,</hi> to diſſwade him from his returne into <hi>Languedock,</hi> amplifying the great daungers which did attend him, if hee ſhould hazard that voyage. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, he went to the Lord <hi>Boillon,</hi> and (hauing made a diſcourſe of the dangers whereinto he did caſt his life and ſtate vpon the feare which he conceaued) ſhewed him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

This being done, there came 25. or 30. Rutters after him to call him, ſaying, that they had ſomewhat to ſay to him. Then hee began to miſtruſt them, as that they would areſt him: and being in the middle of them, vnderſtood that they talked among themſelues, that they had no ſecuritie for their payment, &amp; that the French men ſhould giue them aſſurance.

               <p>The ſaid L. <hi>Chaſtilion</hi> (through great daungers) with his company arriued the 11. of December at a Caſtell in <hi>Viuarets,</hi> called <hi>Retortou,</hi> where was a garriſon of them of the Religion, the fift day after his ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the army.</p>

               <p>This was the end of this armie, by the which God did euidently ſhew to his children, that it is hee onely, vpon whome they ought to caſt their eyes in their afflictions, &amp; that other meanes are altogether vnprofitable, except that he will further them, neither will he further them, except they be well vſed, with an vpright minde and intent.</p>
               <p>This ſeparation of the army tooke away from the enemies of Gods people, all occaſion to ſwell of the victorie, which they may not attribute to their valour, who durſt neuer looke them in the face, and in ſkirmiſhes the enemy had alwaies the worſt, except at <hi>Aulneau</hi> onely, where through their negligence they were ſurpriſed.</p>
               <p>Now Chriſtian Reader, conſider well the vſe of this diſſolution of the Army. The King prepared great power to oppoſe himſelfe to it, vſed great pollicy to drawe it into that ſtraight whereinto they wilfully did caſt themſelues, for not following the good counſell of the K. of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> who would haue them to paſſe aboue the head of <hi>Loyre.</hi> But as men deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of vnderſtanding, heedily went into a manifeſt miſhap, and knew not wherefore, as to cloſe vp themſelues betweene ſo many riuers, whoſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages they knew well to be holden by the enemyes.</p>
               <p>And as the king vſed great pollicie in ſnaring them that way, ſo he tooke great care &amp; labour to diſunite them, that without blowes he might throw them downe: and at length beeing by themſelues weakned, ſent them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to the ſlaughter, vnder the ſhadow of a paſport. If the King had béen ſo long at ſchole with <hi>Salomon</hi> as he was with his mother (the onely fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie that hath beene theſe many ages) hee could haue learned that it was an vnſeemly thing for a king to ſpeake a lie.</p>
               <p>But marke the fruit that he receaued thereby, all this redounded to his vndooing: for of euill can no good bee done by man. The Duke of <hi>Guyze</hi> as he had turned all his actions heretofore to his viſcredit, ſo did he this: for he cauſed certaine horſes which he had taken of the Rutters at the ſkir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh at <hi>Vimory</hi> in <hi>Gastinois,</hi> &amp; at the ſurprize at <hi>Aulneau,</hi> to be lead ſome into one City, and ſome into another, almoſt through all <hi>France,</hi> by his horſecorſers and riders with this ſong, <hi>Saul</hi> hath killed a thouſand, and <hi>Dauid</hi> ten thouſands, as it ſhall be ſhewed in his place: So he made the world beleeue that he had been the onely inſtrument, by the which that ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie had receaued all the harme which they receaued. And whereas the Kinges onely pollicy had vndone that army, yet made he the world beléeue by his horſecorſers, whom he ſent to walke the ſaid. Dutch horſes, whom bee vſed for ſowers of falſe rumors, that not onely the king had willingly let them to eſcape, but alſo had geuen them the meanes to retire, ſome into <hi>Germany,</hi> and ſome into <hi>Languedock,</hi> and from thence to the king of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarre,</hi>
                  <pb n="194" facs="tcp:8966:104"/>
ſo that the pulpits of Fryers and Ieſuits in <hi>Paris</hi> and other cities, did ſound nothing elſe but of theſe newes, extolling the valour, wiſedome, and glory of the Duke of <hi>Guyze,</hi> with procuring to him much popular <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1587.

               <p>Firſt, the promiſe was not obſerued to them, for a great number of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were ſlaine, robbed and ſpoyled in dyuers places. The Duke of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reynes</hi> eldeſt ſonne, called <hi>Marthuis de Pont,</hi> accompanyed with the forces of the League, ſet on them in diuers places, and enuaded the county of <hi>Montbeliard,</hi> where hee committed horrible cruelties, putting all to the ſword, with execrable whoredoms and abominations.</p>
               <p>Many dyed in the way, many dyed when they came in place of ſafety, euen of the cheefeſt noble men.</p>
               <p>The Lords <hi>Boillon, Cleruaut,</hi> and <hi>Vau,</hi> with many other noble men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyred to <hi>Geneua,</hi> where after ſo many labours and greeues they dyed in the Lord.</p>
               <p>The like happened to the Swiſſers, whoſe Colonels and Captayns (who were the authors of the firſt parley and capitulation with the king) were puniſhed by their ſeignories, ſo that few either of the Germans or Swiſſers returned home, or eſcaped vnpuniſhed.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid before, how that <hi>France</hi> in this yeare was groaning vnder the burthen of ſeuen great armies, beſides many particular aſſemblies: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it is ſaid how <hi>Ioyeuſe</hi> and his armie was made ſure at <hi>Coutras,</hi> and their reduced carkaſſes were left in perpetuall infamy, not for their death, but for the cauſes of it.</p>
               <p>The Germans haue made ſhipwracke vppon the Rockes of <hi>Lancy</hi> in <hi>Moſconoys</hi> the eight of December, and after.</p>
               <p>The kinges armie was broken againſt the banke of <hi>Loyre,</hi> and from thence ſcattered euery man home.</p>
               <p>The Leaguers are excluded out of <hi>Daulphine,</hi> where the Catholikes and they of the reformed religion (after much bloodſhed) at length agreed to liue like good fellow cityzens vnder the lawful gouernment of theyr king: and ſo the yeare is ended, and Chriſt raigneth for euermore.</p>

               <p>This was a Prince of great auncient and famous nobilitie, iſſued by the father ſide out of the ſtock of that renowmed <hi>Argonante Godfrey</hi> of <hi>Boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> who was crowned King of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> a noble and vertuous man, his Mother was one of the moſt vertuous women of our age, daughter vnto the Prince <hi>Monpenſier,</hi> and ſiſter vnto this Prince, now at this yeare li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing: her vertue, godlines, and conſtancie in the confeſſion of the true doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, ſhall be in an euerlaſting remembrance. For ſhee being very often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times requeſted by her Father (a great &amp; deuout Catholick) to forſake the Goſpell, and to returne to poperie, at length ſhe agreed vnto him, with this condition, that if the popiſh Doctors could bring better proofes for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, then the miniſters of the reformed would for hers, ſhee would fulfill his will.

               <p>This Principalitie of <hi>Boillon</hi> is a ſmall countrey, holden in ſoueraigntie, yet commonly vnder the protection of the Crowne of <hi>France,</hi> between the riuers <hi>Moſe</hi> and <hi>Moſelle,</hi> a part of the auncient Nation, called <hi>Eburones,</hi> hauing on the Eaſt ſide <hi>Lorreyne</hi> and <hi>Ardenues,</hi> on the Weſt <hi>Henault,</hi> on the North <hi>Liege,</hi> on the South <hi>Baroys</hi> and <hi>Champaigne:</hi> it hath two ſtrong places, <hi>Sedan</hi> and <hi>Iamets,</hi> and many other ſtrong holdes and Caſtels, the Countrey is Woody, Mooriſh, and ſtrong, lying altogether vpon the banck of the riuer <hi>Menſe.</hi> This Countrey ſince it had imbraced the Goſpell, and become the Garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> hath been the place of refuge for them of the reformed religion of the Nations, which doo lie betweene the riuers of <hi>Marne, Seyne, Moſſelle,</hi> and <hi>Saoſne,</hi> a place moſt fit to retire vnto, in time of perſecution.</p>
               <p>There were two bretheren, the Duke of <hi>Boillon,</hi> and the Countie <hi>de la Mark,</hi> two Noble young men of great vertue, valour, and godlines, who had from their cradle, as if it were ſucked the true religion and vertue, with the milke of their vertuous and godly Mother: They ventured all that they had, liues, goods, and ſtate, for the defence of the Crowne of <hi>France</hi>

               <p>Theſe two noble men were called out of this life, vnto that which neuer decayeth, and to inioy the inheritance of the Saincts in light, whoſe names ſhall be in the euerlaſting remembrance of the righteous.

There theſe horſecorſers carried (as if it were in a triumph) through the cities the Germaines ſpoyles, hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, weapons, and all other aray. And when the people were flocked toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in great troupes, to ſee theſe new ſhowes, there were the Orators ready among them. The number of the dead, horſes and Enſignes ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, were increaſed by the figure of multiplication, one killed a hundred, and a hundred ten thouſand, as <hi>Pyrgopolinices</hi> in <hi>Plautus:</hi> the manner of the fight was made very difficult, and dangerous for the conquerours.

               <p>Then they applied their ſhowes, how that the Duke of <hi>Guize</hi> had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiued himſelfe all the difficulties of the warre, and either ſlaine or taken the choſen and valiant Captaines and Soul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

victorie. But the King he retyred beyond <hi>Loyre,</hi> as though he had beene vnwilling or afeard of them, for he would or durſt neuer ſhew his face, or draw his ſword againſt them, and for to ſhew ſome outward countenance, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1588. Ianuarie"/> or for ſhame when the enemie were alreadie vanquiſhed, and that the Duke of <hi>Guize</hi> had left the ſmall remnant, who were but pages and ſcullions, ſo hurt, wearie, and ſick, that they could not flie, truſting that they would haue been diſpatched by the King, they were followed ſo ſlackly, that not onely he gaue them leaſure to eſcape without running, but alſo helped them to ouercome ſo many diſtreſſes wherunto they were driue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the ſaid Duke of <hi>Guyze,</hi> &amp; alſo vnder colour of a counterfeit yeelding and ſubmiſſion, he granted vnto them their liues, horſes and furniture, and to ſome of them their goods, and by theſe meanes they came all to their iourneys end, and ſafely arryued to the King of <hi>Nauarre.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the concluſion of theſe infamous reports, was left to euery man to inferre, that eyther there was not in the King ſuch princelike vertues as ſhould be in him, or elſe that hee was a fauourer of heretikes, and a diſſembler with the Catholikes. Then what ſhould wee doe with ſuch a King: Let vs haue another. And whome ſhould we haue, but him that hath done ſuch exployts, and deliuered <hi>France</hi> from ſo manie daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and terrors.</p>
               <p>By theſe deuiſes, hatred and contempt was no leſſe procured againſt the King, as, <hi>gloria in excelſis,</hi> prayſe, loue, fauour, and authoritie to the Duke of <hi>Guyze.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Ieſuites and Friers on the other ſide tooke theſe lyings and ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous reportes for a theme to diſcourſe vpon in the pulpits, he that was of a timorous minde cryed, that the King was a betrayer of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes, he was become either a cloſe and deſembling heretike, or a fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of heretikes, and that it was to be feared ere long hee would forſake the catholiciſme, and ouerthrow the Catholike Religion in <hi>France:</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers which had a more warlike ſtomack, diſcourſed vpon the other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon place, that the K. had a timorous mind, durſt not look few (Pages and Scullions halfe vanquiſhed) in the face, and that was the cauſe that many attempts vpon the heretikes had come to ſmall effect, becauſe the warres were not purſued by men neither of courage nor wiſedome. But the Duke of <hi>Guize,</hi> that noble branch of <hi>Charlemaigne,</hi> the deliuerer of <hi>France,</hi> the onely protector of the holy Church, was the onely man to whome they owe their religion, their liues and goods, the onely hope of the Realme. Thus the frogges that roſe vp out of the bottomeleſſe pit, did dayly in their pulpits crie croake, croake, croake.</p>
               <p>There was great hope that the ſundry lamentable euents which did beate the one and the other part in <hi>France</hi> by the ſcourge of warre, and execution of armours as well in the loſſe of the battell at <hi>Coutras,</hi> in the
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:8966:106"/>
death of notable men, as in the oppreſſion and hauock which the armies did cary with them, would haue aſſwaged the rage and paſſion which ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1588.

Sathan therefore (the captaine of murtherers of the Saints) deuided his forces, one part to aſſault the remnaunt of the Church left in the popiſh prouinces of <hi>France,</hi> and the Churches of the principalitie of <hi>Boillon,</hi> which we will in order recite.</p>
               <p>As after the breaking of the armie of the prince of <hi>Conde</hi> in <hi>Vandomoys,</hi> in the yeare of our Lord 1585. they thought that with the ſame Prince al their hope had been gone; which thing made them increaſe their crueltie: euen ſo did they after the diſſipation of the armie of the Germanes, ſuppoſing that they ſhould ſhortly ſee the end thereof.</p>
               <p>The authors of theſe perſecutions, were the King, the Leaguers, the Biſhops, the Ieſuytes, the Fryers, the Monkes, the pariſh Prieſts and Magiſtrates. In theſe aſſaults appeared the cowardlines of a great many of them who had profeſſed the true religion, who looking more on the euents and preſent dangers, than to the end of ſuch ſkirmiſhes (where we ought to ſhew a proofe of our fayth, and with pacience to expect an happyend) for feare were caried away to vnlawfull things againſt their conſcience.</p>
               <p>But the Lord (as at all other times) left not his truth without wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes: for many in diuers parts of the Realme being cruelly perſecuted, ſhewed their conſtancie in maintaining their faith and religion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it ſeemeth me, not to be out of purpoſe to make mention of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie which God gaue to a man of baſe condition, in defending of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, who in this reſpect ſhewed the way to many, which in the ſight of the worlde had greater meanes to doe it than he had.</p>
               <p>There was in the towne of <hi>Marchenoyre</hi> in <hi>Beauſſe</hi> a poore man borne in <hi>Boyſgencye</hi> vpon <hi>Loyre,</hi> named <hi>Francis Tixier:</hi> (as if wee ſhoulde ſaie weauer) this man by his occupation was a maker of packſaddles, who (by reaſon of his family) had not departed out of the Realme according to the Kings Edicts, neither had obeyed the Kinges commandement in conforming himſelfe to the Popiſh religion, but had alwayes conſtantly remained in the profeſſion of the true religion, praying dayly in his houſe, &amp; often times ioyning himſelfe ſecretly to others to the ſame effect, and to ſing Pſalms, as it is vſed among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who do profeſſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reformed religion.</p>
               <p>He viſited alſo them who were ſicke, and ſtrengthened them: and if any
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:8966:107"/>
were which ſtoode in neede, by the meane of ſome ſmall collections which was made among them ſecretly, hee helped them, as he was wont to doo <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1588. Ianuarie"/> when the reformed Church did aſſemble at <hi>Orges,</hi> in the which he did beare the office of an Elder.</p>
               <p>God bleſſed that zeale in time ſo hard and difficult: for ſome of the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages thereabous, by the meane of that ſmall exerciſe, without feare of the perſecution, forſaking the Romiſh Church, ioyned themſelues to the pure religion. But this courſe was not continued long: for by the watches and ſearches of them, who in the former aſſaults &amp; alarumes could get nothing vpon this man, he was at length diſcouered and complained off to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate. So that the King paſſing through <hi>Marchenoyre,</hi> the accuſers addreſſed themſelues to one of his Aulmoners, and inſtructed him of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine accuſations againſt that poore man, to wit, that hee had not obeyed the Kings edict, but on the contrarie did perſeuer in his hereſie and dogma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize: ſo they kindled the Aulmoner in ſuch a ſort, that they agreed altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to put a complaint to the King: they made alſo a booke of others of the religion, which they cauſed the ſayd Aulmoner to preſent to the King. For his cuſtome belike was ſo to beſtowe the Kings almes.</p>
               <p>The King commaunded that they ſhould bee apprehended: <hi>Tixier</hi> as the moſt hatefull, was firſt taken, and with great ſolemnitie brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King, who was deſirous to ſee him, for he was informed that hée was a Miniſter. The King himſelfe examined him (when he had appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) with great aſſurance. When the King had aſked him whether he was an <hi>Hugonet,</hi> and wherefore he had not gone out of the Realme being one, (as he did confeſſe) and whether he would goe to Maſſe once or twiſe, and ſo to eſcape from puniſhment. The poore man anſwered, that he had not the meanes to auoyde, and that he would not goe to Maſſe, nor alter his religion which he knewe to be the trueth.</p>
               <p>When the King perceiued his conſtancie, he ſent him to <hi>Bloys,</hi> with let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to his Iudges, there commaunding them ſtraightly to make his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, according to the rigour of his edicts. There in the Kings preſence he was greatly reuiled by the Lords, Courtiers and Clawbackes.</p>
               <p>Being carried to <hi>Bloys,</hi> there he was aſſaulted by three manner of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, the Iudges, his friends, and the reſt of priſoners. Firſt the Iudges had him in hand, and after they had gone about to withdrawe him from his religion to Poperie, with ſuch bald reaſons as they could affoord, he made them a plaine anſwere, that he knewe the true Catholike and Apoſtolike Church, and that hee was one of the fellowe citizens of the ſame; but for the Romiſh Church he neither knewe it, nor cared to knowe. When theſe great Deuines had ſpent all their reaſons euen to the bottome, they began to drawe out their threatnings to hang him, and to giue him opprobrious words. The poore man deſpiſing their reaſons and the dregges thereof,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:8966:107"/>
made them a flat anſwere, that as he had liued in that religion, which they call hereſie, ſo was he readie to dye for it, if ſo it were Gods will. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1588. Ianuarie"/>
               </p>
               <p>And after many examinations all about on thing, to wit, whether hee would goe to maſſe, one aſked him of whom he held his religion, and who had taught him: he anſwered, that hee held it of God who had taught him by his holy ſpirit.</p>
               <p>Vpon this anſwere, one Saint <hi>Seuerine</hi> an Italian replyed: my frend, thine holy ſpirit will hang thee, if thou come not to thy ſelfe. The Lord reproue the ſpirit of blaſphemy.</p>
               <p>This was the miſerable ſtate of that realme then, that the moſt vile, ſaucy &amp; blaſphemous Atheiſtes, were rayſed vp by the <hi>Q. Mother</hi> to high and honorable dignities.</p>
               <p>Saynt <hi>Paul</hi> had learned the Phariſaiſme at the feete of <hi>Guualiel:</hi> but this lewd Italian had learned Atheiſme at the Popes feete in Italy, and is welcome in <hi>France</hi> by them of his religion to teach Atheiſme, and to ſhew the way to the Frenchmen how to blaſpheme a <hi>l'Italiane.</hi> Many other ſuch like trifling talke they had with the pore man, more fit for gatherers of old ſhooes and ragges vppon the dunghil of <hi>Bloys,</hi> then for magiſtrates.</p>
               <p>The Priſoners did greatly afflict him with their continuall brabling, and brawling with him, with few popiſh vnreaſonable reaſons, which they tooke out of certayne Sermons of popiſh Frierly Doctors, which they had among them, and not onely did daily complaine vppon him to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, but alſo were ſome time ready to ſet vppon him to mur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The third ſort of enemies who did aſſault him, were they which profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed friendſhip, who oftentimes came to aduertize him in the priſon, that the Iudges had concluded to condemne him to die: and that it were high time to looke about, perſwading him to auoid the danger, to goe to Maſſe once or twiſe, and after he could make ſome ſhift to get him out of the way: but he refuſed all that counſell.</p>
               <p>So he made his will, fully determined to die, which hee ſent to his wife: yet the Iudges muſt haue a fling more to trye what he would do, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe reſolue to condemne him, &amp; made him ſit vpon the ſtoole, whereupon they that are condemned of capitall crimes are vſed to ſit when they do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue ſentence of condemnation.</p>
               <p>But behold, on a ſudden they changed their mynds, and ſent him againe into priſon. The King had written, and ſet his owne hand to a letter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding them to make his Proceſſe with all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But the Lord (to the comfort of his children) did put a ring in their Noſtrels, and after a long impriſonment, the eight of Aprill they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced ſentence agaynſt the ſayd <hi>Tyxier,</hi> by the which they baniſhed him <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1588.

               </p>
               <p>It is ſayd, how the two noble Princes of <hi>Boillon,</hi> and his brother the County <hi>de la Mark,</hi> dyed, the one in the Moneth of October at <hi>Lany,</hi> and the other in <hi>Geneua</hi> in Ianuary.</p>
               <p>The death of this noble Prince being publiſhed abroad, the Leaguers tooke it for a preſage of their good ſucceſſe, and occaſion to encreaſe their power.</p>
               <p>As for to enterprize any thing againſt <hi>Guyenne,</hi> or the king of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> the bad ſucceſſe of <hi>de Mayne,</hi> and the death of <hi>Ioyeuſe</hi> at <hi>Coutras,</hi> did not counſell them. There was as little hope in other Prouinces, where they of the reformed were ſtrong in armes and fortes, as in <hi>Languedock,</hi> and <hi>Daulphine,</hi> where now of late an aſſotiation vpon the defenſiue was made betweene the Catholikes and them of the Religion.</p>
               <p>To attempt the old plat agaynſt the kings perſon, the time was not yet come.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, they did greatly feare the tempeſt which did threaten them on the ſide of <hi>Germany,</hi> by reaſon of the fires which they had kindled in the County of <hi>Montpeliard,</hi> and the execrable outrages by them there committed, where (as is aforeſayd) they charged the Rutters in them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyring homeward.</p>
               <p>This feare cauſed the Duke of <hi>Lorreyne</hi> to ſend to the king for ſuccour, for they thought that it would be greatly for their aduantage, if the King in defending them on that ſide, might haue procured the hatred of the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, and with all conſumed his forces in defending and iuſtifying theyr vilanies: and ſo all by one meanes ſhould ſpoyle himſelfe of the amity of his neighbours, and of his owne forces, in being after more eaſy to be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by them.</p>
               <p>Therefore among ſo many difficultyes, nothing ſeemed vnto them more commodious to beſtow and exercize their forces, and by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to encreaſe their power, then to inuade the ſaid principallity of <hi>Boillon,</hi> ſuppoſing that to be of an eaſy executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (conſidering the opportunity prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered it ſelfe) thereby preparing the way by eaſy thinges to harder and more difficult matters.</p>
               <p>The oportunity ſeemed vnto them very fit, to wit, the death of the two bretheren, the amaze which fell vpon the ſubiectes in the territory of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi> and <hi>Iamets.</hi> The weakenes of the yong Princeſſe fatherles, in tears

               <p>Other friends of the contrary profeſſion durſt not ſhewe her any fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable looke, for feare to be heretikes, or fauourers of hereſie, and ſo to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke agaynſt themſelues the bloodie power of the League. And that which is more, ſhe being accounted an hereticke for profeſſing of the trueth, and therefore accurſed by the Pope, proſcript by the League, and as it were dead to the world, by the articles of <hi>Nancy,</hi> whereof it ſhall be ſpoken here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after at large.</p>
               <p>And to that ende they might the better both to inuade that yong Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe and reſiſt the Germans, whom they feared, by reaſon of the villanies wherewith they had prouoked them, as is aboue ſayd, they had ſuccour of the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> Italians, Spanyards, Wallons, Legeoys &amp; Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, vnder the conduct of the Baron of <hi>Sarexenbourg,</hi> to the number of ten thouſand men in all.

               <p>In the meane while, the Princeſſe cauſed the inhabitants to ſweare fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie to her, and gaue the gouernment of her affayres vnto the Lord <hi>Nue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile,</hi> vntill ſhe might vnderſtand of the Prince <hi>Monpenſier</hi> her vncle, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted Warde, and of the Lord <hi>la Noue,</hi> executor of the Will of her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but ſpecially of the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> whoſe counſel ſhe deſired great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to followe.</p>
               <p>The companie which ſhe had were the Princeſſe her ſelfe, the Princeſſe <hi>Bourbon,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Laual,</hi> a young child the heire of the Lord <hi>Laual,</hi> who dyed at <hi>Taillebourg</hi> the yeare 1586. in Aprill, as is aforeſayd.</p>
               <p>The forces were the inhabitants of the countrey, and a certaine num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Frenchmen exiled out of their countrey, by reaſon of the perſecution of the League.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Boillon</hi> being dead, the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> was certified thereof from <hi>Geneua,</hi> and alſo from <hi>Sedan</hi> an expreſſe meſſenger was ſent to the ſayd King, to let him vnderſtand the ſtate and neceſſitie of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayres.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> vnderſtanding the ſtate of <hi>Sedan,</hi> the iniuries and violences of the League, ſent thether the Lord <hi>Reaulx,</hi> and from thence to the King, to put him in mind of the protection which he did owe to the ſayd Princeſſe, and of the ſeruices done by her predeceſſors to the Crowne of <hi>France:</hi> but ſpecially to ſhewe him the importance of the places which the

               </p>
               <p>She ſent alſo to her vncle the Prince <hi>Monpenſier,</hi> who promiſed her all aſſiſtance to his power. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1588. Ianuarie"/>
               </p>
               <p>The Dukes of <hi>Sweibrook</hi> ſent her word, that they would doo what lay in them to diuert thoſe forces from her.</p>
               <p>The King not greatly regarding the ſuit and protection of the ſayd La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, for hatred of the reformed religion, ſent backe againe the Lord <hi>Reaulx</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Lorreyne,</hi> where he taried ſo long that all things were bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and ſpoyled before he returned to <hi>Sedan.</hi> And at his returne he deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a commiſſion from the King, to be receaued as Lieutenant generall for the King, and protector of the Princeſſe: and that after being receaued when they had giuen their oth, then he would declare what order ſhould be taken.</p>
               <p>They made anſwere, that it was a newe thing, and that the ſoueraigne Lords of <hi>Sedan</hi> had neuer receaued ſuch charges, and therefore they could not accept them, conſidering that they had giuen their oth vnto the Prince <hi>Monpenſier</hi> her vncle and Warden, to doo her lawfull and faithful ſeruice, and to keepe the places againſt all men, vnder the protection of his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie: who would (as he hoped) bée contented with the aſſurance which the Prince <hi>Monpenſier</hi> would giue him.</p>
               <p>About the ſame time, the Lord <hi>Nueuile</hi> gouernour of <hi>Mezieres,</hi> came to <hi>Ioram</hi> nigh <hi>Sedan,</hi> ſeeking by fayre promiſes of friendſhip to haue that Lieutenantſhip: and propounding certaine captious articles, was ſo an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that if he had come into <hi>Sedan,</hi> there was not of his kinne enough for halfe the women of <hi>Sedan:</hi> for euen they who mooued the matter firſt ſtood in ſome danger.</p>
               <p>The Prince <hi>Monpenſier</hi> ſent diuers times to viſite and aſſiſt her, and went to the Court to obtayne the continuance of her protection. But no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was obtayned; for the King ſought nothing els, but to put in ſuch as he thought would fulfill his deſire to oppreſſe and ſcatter the Church, and to haue in his poſſeſſion that Princeſſe, to nouſſe her vp in Poperie, that there might not be any hope left hereafter to reſtore the Church.</p>
               <p>Whileſt the Duke of <hi>Lorreyne</hi> beſieged <hi>Iamets,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Guize</hi> ſent to <hi>Sedan</hi> to proffer them great friendſhip, and to preſerue them in all libertie of conſcience and religion, if ſo that there might a mariage be made betwéene the Princeſſe and his ſonne.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Lorreyne</hi> vſing all manner of hoſtilitie and villanies that could be poſſible, made ſuite to haue the ſayd Princeſſe in marriage for his ſonne the Lord <hi>Vaudimount,</hi> both with flattering words, &amp; alſo by thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring of the double Canon.</p>
               <p>The weaknes of this Princeſſe cauſed the enemy to be very ſecure and careleſſe, which encouraged them which were beſieged at <hi>Iamets,</hi> dayly to
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:8966:109"/>
make ſturdy and ſtout ſallies vppon the enemies, geuing them no aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, not ſo much as to approach to place their peeces, and compelled them to trench themſelues in the Vilages, where they were charged by them <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1588. Ianuarie"/> within the towne dayly: and this continued vntill the beginning of Aprill next following.</p>
               <p>During theſe two Moneths of February and March, and the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the ſiege of <hi>Iamets,</hi> the Lord <hi>Reſne,</hi> with certayne troupes of Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians, Germans, Wallons, Legeoys, and Lorreins, to the number of 7. or 8. hundred horſes, with certayne regiments of footmen, did ſcowre the countrey about <hi>Sedan,</hi> where they fired all thinges: ſo that in all the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality of <hi>Boillon</hi> there remained in a maner but aſhes and calamity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides <hi>Sedan</hi> and <hi>Iamets.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Their outrages and cruelties were ſuch that the like were neuer heard of. For all maner of whoredome, rauiſhments, violences and woorſe, were committed by thoſe infernall helhowndes, villaines, and ſauage robbers: beſides, they put all women, maidens, and children to raunſome as many as they could take: ſuch violences they continued vntill the latter end of March, thereby to terrify this yong and deſolat Princeſſe.</p>
               <p>Whileſt the Leaguers (as fire brands blowne out of hell, ſubiect vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to no law, gouernment, nor power, do proffer iniuries vnto all maner of perſons, without any reſpect, about the beginning of February, while they tryed by al means poſſible, both by faire words &amp; open viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, to ſeaze both vpon the perſon and ſtate of the Princeſſe of <hi>Boillon:</hi> the chiefeſt of them aſſembled at <hi>Nancy</hi> in <hi>Lorreine,</hi> where they continued in counſell vntil the middeſt of Februarie, in the which aſſembly they concluded many articles againſt the Kings perſon and ſtate, alſo they tooke order to continue the ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill warres, which they had kindled, and that ſtill vnder the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>olour of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh religion, they might win by little and little, and ſo make themſelues way to the ſtate, by the vndooing of whome ſoeuer.</p>
               <p>And for as much as they were out of hope to preuaile againſt them of the reformed religion in <hi>Guyenne,</hi> or other where, they aduiſed themſelues by policie, to giue the King no reſt, by hampring him into new troubles, in propoſing to him vnreaſonable requeſts, and ſtill vnder colour of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholickiſme.</p>
               <p>For there they framed articles which haue three principal finall cauſes, to deſtroy the King, the nobilitie, and to ſaue themſelues.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, either to ſhorten the Kings life by ſome lot of warre, or elſe at the leaſt to weaken him, and make him odious to the Church-men.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is, to kindle and entertaine the warre immortall, that the nobilitie may be deſtroyed by mutuall blowes and woundes.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, to ſaue themſelues from blowes and charges, and to keepe themſelues in authoritie, vntill the opportunitie which they watched for
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:8966:110"/>
ſhould proffer it ſelf: theſe things are euidently ſeen in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> articles following.</p>
               <p>But here firſt before wee come to theſe articles, marke well (Chriſtian Reader) the turkiſh hearts, who contemning all that is named God and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1588. Februarie"/> Iuſtice, they haue extinguiſhed in themſelues all humanitie and reuerence of ſuperioritie. For contrarie vnto all humanitie, they went about to ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſh away that noble Princeſſe, iſſued of noble race, left deſolate, father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, brotherleſſe, and friendleſſe, and alſo to lay hand vpon her ſtate. Now haue they deſpiſed the ſuperioritie ordayned of God, when they deſperatly and imperiouſly dare giue lawe to their Soueraigne, euen ſuch law as is altogether vnreaſonable, contrarie to the duetie of ſubiects. But now let vs come to the articles.</p>
               <p>Firſt, they ſay the King ſhall be requeſted to ioyne himſelfe more open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the League, and ſhall put away from him, and out of his ſtrong holdes, and out of all ſtates and offices of any waight, ſuch as ſhall bee na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med vnto him.</p>
               <p>Here firſt they will haue the King, to take vpon him all the ſhame, diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and hatred of their deteſtable actions and iniuries, which they doo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Note</hi>
                  </note> to proffer to all manner of men, vnder the name of the League, which they will the King to take vpon him in theſe words, that they wil haue him to ioyne with the League.</p>
               <p>Secondly, whereas they ſeeke to diſplace from about him ſuch as they would, their intent is to depriue him of his authoritie, forces, and faithfull friends, to put him vnderward, that he may raigne at their diſcretion, and no longer then it ſhall pleaſe them.</p>
               <p>The ſecond article is, that the King ſhall cauſe the counſell of <hi>Trent</hi> to be publiſhed, authoriſed, and receaued in his dominions, onely the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be ſtayed for a time, concerning the reuoking of certaine exemptions and priuiledges of ſome Chapters, Abbeys, and other Churches from their Biſhops.</p>
               <p>This article they doo ſet foorth to bee the ſeede of immortall warres, knowing well that it cannot be publiſhed without the ſound of the trumpet <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Note</hi>
                  </note> and double Canon.</p>
               <p>The third article is, that the King ſhall eſtabliſh the holy inquiſition of <hi>Spayne,</hi> at the leaſt in good townes, which is the onely way to roote out hereticks, and ſuſpected, ſo that the officers of the ſaid Inquiſition be ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, or at the leaſt be not borne in the places, where they may haue neither kindred, friends, nor alyaunce.</p>
               <p>This is the meanes to execute the decrees of the counſell, which in the former article they haue giuen to the kingdome of <hi>France</hi> for a law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that by <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Note</hi>
                  </note> that law all the inhabitants of the realme, who ſhall be to the Inquiſitors, either hereticks, or ſuſpected: for who will not be ſuſpected if it pleaſeth maſter Frier the Inquiſitour.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="207" facs="tcp:8966:110"/>
Secondly, the inquiſitors muſt needes be either Lorreines or Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, two nations delighting in the blood of Frenchmen, as the Wolfe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1588. Februarie"/> in the blood of Lambs, or elſe they may not haue any kindred, ſay they: that is, that neither blood, duetie of nature, nor friendſhip, may let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from euill doing, and from ſubuerting the french nation. The ſumme of this article is, that the french nation may bee deſtroyed without mercy or compaſſion.</p>
               <p>The fourth article is, that the King ſhal grant licence vnto the church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, to redeeme at any time the Church goods, and landes which they haue ſould, of whatſoeuer quality the ſaid goods and lands be, or they that haue bought them. And that the King ſhall compell the beneficed men to make ſuch a redemption within a certaine time that ſhall be prefixed to them, according to the abilitie that they ſhall be found to bee of, by them that ſhall be appoynted to ſee the ſtate of their reuenewes and lands.</p>
               <p>The Leaguers haue made the churchmen to blowe the Trompet of <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Note</hi>
                  </note> ciuill warres, vpon that condition that they ſhould not fight themſelues, but pay money to them that would fight for them, and ſo haue made them ſell their church landes. Now they will enforce the poore Prieſts to buy againe their church lands, that they may ſell them againe when the Leaguers haue neede of them.</p>
               <p>The fift article is, that the King ſhall put into the handes of ſome of them, certaine places of importance which ſhall bee named to him: In the which it ſhall be lawfull for them to build Fortreſſes, and put in men of warre, as they ſhall think good, and all at the charges of the townes, cities and countreys: the like alſo they ſhall doe in the places which they hold at the time of the making of theſe articles.</p>
               <p>The leaguers doo thinke that the King had too great a portion in the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Note</hi>
                  </note> laſt deuiſion of his kingdome which they made with him in Iuly 1585. and that the King was too ſtrong for them yet. Therefore by this article they doo call him to a new deuiſion, wherein they goe about to doo three things.</p>
               <p>Firſt they would haue more ſtrong places, and ſuch as they themſelues ſhall appoynt. It is to be thought that they will not make choyſe of the worſt. For if the King ſhould put them to their choyſe, I dare affirme that they would chooſe <hi>Paris, Calis, Anious, Reymes, Bologne, Newhauen, Caen, Roan, Orleans, Tours, Naunts, Poytiers, Bourdeaulx, Limoges, Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geulx, Tholouſe, Bayone, Narboune, Marſeilles, Lyons, Dijous, Auxone, Langaes, Seus, Mets,</hi> and other ſuch which they doe meane by places of importance.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they would haue the King this to doe for them, as to ſuffer them quietly to build citadels, and therein to put garriſons, which they gently call fortes, and men of warre to keepe out the King, if at any time
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:8966:111"/>
he ſhould change his mind and call for his owne.</p>
               <p>The third is, that the king and his poore ſubiectes ſhall beare the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of fortifiyng and keeping theſe places from his obedience, that thence <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1588. Februarie"/> they may eaſily oppreſſe him when they ſhall ſpie time, and tyramze his ſubiects.</p>
               <p>The ſixt article is, that the King ſhall giue pay to men ofwarre, to be maintained in <hi>Lorreyn</hi> vpon the borders of <hi>Germany,</hi> to let the entrie of the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Note.</hi>
                  </note> ſtrangers their Neighbours, and for that ende ſhall cauſe out of hand the goods of herelikes, and others which be aſſociat with them to be ſould.</p>
               <p>The cauſe of this article was feare of the vengeance which their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence repreſented continually before their eies, for the great enormityes, iniuries, &amp; execrable abominations by them committed in the County of <hi>Noubeliard:</hi> for they perceauing their weaknes in ſtrength and wealth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that hot, vindicatiue and mighty nation of <hi>Germany,</hi> would haue the King to defend them, and ſo doing, iuſtify their vilanous actions, and thereby to begger himſelfe, and procure the hatred of that Nation, which had beene alwayes at amity with the Crowne of <hi>France.</hi>

               <p>The eight article is, that the Catholikes ſhall pay the tenth part of their reuenues euery yeare. And that commiſſioners be appointed to make the ſallies and taxes, as well of eccleſiaſticall, as lay perſons: others not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding then officers of the Soueraygne courts, that all things may be executed more ſpeedily and with leſſe charges.</p>
               <p>In this article, firſt the Leaguers ſpare neither friendes nor foes, but <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Note.</hi>
                  </note> that they are ſomewhat more fauourable to the Catholikes then to the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiks.
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:8966:111"/>
For whereas they were promiſed at the firſt ryſing of the league to be eaſed of all impoſt: now three years after they are taxed to pay y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 10. part of all their goods, vntil they be diſcharged of all taxes and impoſt. And if <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1588.

               <p>Secondly, they will not put in truſt about their tirannous deuiſes none of the kinges faithfull officers and ſeruants whom they ſuſpect, but ſuch Commiſſioners as be of theyr owne making, of their owne qualities, and ſuch as will ſay to all their dooings Amen.</p>
               <p>The ninth article is, that the friendes of heretikes which are of their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociate, ſhall be enforced by all meanes poſſible to buy their goods, in aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vnto them the fifth part of the value: and when they ſhall be ſold to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, vpon their refuſing, they ſhall not be receaued afterward to haue any action to recouer them.</p>
               <p>Here be two thinges full of wrong and Turkiſh oppreſſion.</p>

               <p>Secondly, that the ancient law of aguation, grounded vpon the ciuill law of the Romanes, and vſed in the Realme aboue one thouſand yeares (by the which the next of kindred might recouer the land of his kinſman a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienated, in repaying the money within a certayine time) ſhould be altered by new men, who within a mans age had no more to do in the realme then they haue this day in <hi>Turkie:</hi> that law I ſay, that the Kinges of <hi>France</hi> neuer ſought to alter, neither had been able to do it if they would.</p>
               <p>The tenth article is, that the firſt ſummes of money that ſhall be made of that ſale, ſhall be beſtowed to pay the moſt needfull debts of the heads of the League, and the ouerplus ſhall bee put in the handes of ſuch as ſhall be named, with condition that they ſhall not be emploied otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>In this Article wee may obſerue two prety ſhameles tokens: for firſt, theſe beggerly Lords, iſſued out of the cauerns of the beggerly mountains <note place="margin">

ſhal we do when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> is done? for all wilbe but a gnat in an Elephants mouth: wee muſt begin to ſell againe, and for lack of goods and lands to ſell, wee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1588.

               <p>The tenth article is, that the life of any priſoner of the enemie, meaning the hereticks, as they tearme them, be not ſpared, except he wil abiure, and put in good ſureties to liue Catholickly, in paying preſently the iuſt value of his goods, if they haue not been ſold alreadie. And in caſe they haue béen ſold, he ſhall renounce all right which he may pretend hereafter, and ſhall binde himſelfe to ſerue three yeares and more in any ſeruice that he ſhall be imployed, without receauing any wages or paye.</p>
               <p>This is the law wherewith Mahomet the falſe Prophet did ſtrengthen his tirannie and ſuperſtition, for thus hee ſpeaketh <gap reason="foreign">

The only difference is, that <hi>Mahomets</hi> lawe is ſomewhat more fauourable, in as much as it is but onely againſt the ſpeakers againſt his religion, but not againſt them who ſhall be taken in warre.</p>
               <p>But this dooth violate the lawe of Nations, and right of ſuppleants, which alwaies haue been kept inuiolable: and the violating thereof had been alwaies accounted among all Nations, worthie to be reuenged with fire and ſword. By this lawe of <hi>Nancy</hi> they will make this Nation ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous in the praiſe of humanitie, more ſauage than the very barbarous Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>Secondly, life here is redeemed onely with abiuration and violating of conſcience, which is more than the Turke, or any other Nation on the earth dooth practiſe.</p>
               <p>At laſt followeth bondage, which muſt indure as long as it ſhall pleaſe the Lords and Senators of <hi>Nancy.</hi> This is the nature of this monſtrous lawe borne at <hi>Nancy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The effects of this ſtrange new law were to roote out the Fren<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For it maketh the Catholicks without any hope of remiſſion, to murther the <hi>Hugonets contraius gentium &amp; ſupplicum:</hi> and it inforceth the <hi>Hugonets, lege talionis,</hi> to deſtroy the Catholicks for the violating of the right of Nations and Suppliants. And thus we ſhall be well recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for the ſelling of our goods &amp; lands. Theſe articles be ſuch, as if a Lord ſhould offer them to his ſlaues, it were lawfull for them to vſe all meanes poſſible againſt him. But theſe new Gods on earth dare preſent ſo vniuſt, ſo vnreaſonable, ſo vnreuerent conditions and lawes vnto one of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Monarkies in the World: but what is it that theſe ſhameles men dare not preſume for aduauntage?</p>
               <p>Theſe articles agreed vpon by theſe wiſe Senatours and Law-giuers in <hi>Nancy,</hi> the Metropolitan vilage of <hi>Lorreyne,</hi> were brought to the King
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:8966:112"/>
to be approued by him: but there was ſome delay in the approbation. And as for ſuch as made for the ſuppreſſing of the reformed religion, hee did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1588. Februarie"/> with them, but to the reſt he could not by any meanes condeſend, kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing with a good iudgement, that they tooke religion for no other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence but to couer their ambition, and by theſe meanes to weaken his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, and to rid him out of the way, by whatſoeuer meanes, and alſo all them whom they knew, were able and willing to hold plea for the Crowne againſt them: which thing cauſed that theſe articles of <hi>Nancy,</hi> but ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuch as touched the Kings ſtrong places and holdes to bee deliuered to them, could not be approued by the King.</p>
               <p>It is ſaide in the firſt booke, how the <hi>Guyzes</hi> making all haſt that they might to vſurp the Crowne, thought good to rid out of the way <hi>Monſieur</hi> the Kings only brother, and how at <hi>Nancy,</hi> the ſhop of al the treacheries in theſe perilous dayes, they hired one <hi>Salcedo</hi> a Spaniard to haue diſpat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched him one way or another, and for to bring that to paſſe, they deliuered him for an earneſt at the beginning 6000. Crownes. Now in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner theſe Senators of <hi>Nancy</hi> doo propound in their counſell to ſearch out, and how to take away the impediments which may let them to come ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilie to their intended purpoſe: it was found ſpeciallie to bee the King, and the Princes of the bloud, but among them chiefely the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Conde.</hi> Therefore they muſt bee made away by one meanes or another: and whereas warre and violence were neither the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt nor the ſureſt way, they concluded that poyſon muſt bee tried. But to bring this to an happie end, they muſt haue the helpe of the <hi>Q. Mother,</hi> ſhe muſt be one inſtrument to commit parricides: for it is to be thought, that if ſhe would not ſpare her owne Sonne <hi>Charles</hi> the 9. ſhe would not ſpare them whome ſhe neuer loued: for ſhe neuer cared what ſhee did, ſo that ſhee might not doo good, ſhe is therefore eaſily won, to doo that which ſhe great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſired.</p>
               <p>Poyſoners are hired, they haue their drougges and inſtructions with them: ſome are ſent to miniſter their Phiſick to the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> if by any meanes they could. But howſoeuer it be, either that they which were hired to poyſon the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> did altar their mindes, or had not the meanes to execute ſo vilanous an act, ſo it is, that his death was bruted in <hi>Lorreyne,</hi> and at the Court about the ſame time that the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> dyed. But it hath pleaſed the Lord to haue deliuered him from their ſnares, to puniſh them in time, according to the meaſure of the treacheries and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable enormities by them committed.</p>
               <p>As touching the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> they had their mindes vpon him, for at length, the diuel furthering their treacheries, procured ſome of his owne houſhold ſeruants to bee wonne to take the matter in hand, and among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, one <hi>Brillant</hi> and a Page (vpon whome he had beſtowed great bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits)
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:8966:113"/>
to giue him poyſon the third day of March at ſupper, he fell ſick of a great paine of the ſtomack, about an howre an a halfe after ſupper: that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1587. March"/> paine was followed incontinentlie with great vomiting, comming at ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie times with continuation of the ſaid paine, and with a great thirſt: hee was aſſiſted by <hi>Nicolas Poget,</hi> his maſter Chirurgion. At the ſame houre was called Maſter <hi>Bonauenture de Medicis,</hi> Doctor of Phiſick: which conſidering the accidents, did helpe the vomitings following therein, the motions of nature. The ſicknes notwithſtanding continued all the night, hauing inuaded the inferiour bellie with ſwelling and hardnes of the ſame, with ſuch difficultie to take breath, that he could not lie in his bed, but was faine to ſit ſtill in a chayre.</p>
               <p>The morrow after were called to counſell <hi>Lewis Bontempts,</hi> and <hi>Ihan Pallet,</hi> Doctors of Phiſick, who altogether did indeuour to helpe his Excellencie with all diligence and fidelitie, by all the meanes which they iudged fit, according to the accurrant accidents.</p>

               <p>In the death of this Prince, God did ſhoote an arrow of his wrath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the vngratefulnes &amp; peruerſitie of this world, but ſpeciallie againſt <hi>France,</hi> in plucking this Noble Prince out of ſo many labours, into the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie of the inheritance of his Saints in light.</p>

               <p>His death was the more to be lamented, becauſe it was vyolent, and in the flower of his age, which happened the fift day of March 1588. at S. <hi>Jhan d' Angely</hi> in <hi>Xainctonge,</hi> to the great griefe of all men, among whome from age to age, the remembrance of him ſhall be honorable.

               <p>The death of this noble Prince amazed all men in <hi>Xainctonge,</hi> knowing that God had ſome heauie iudgements to execute vppon <hi>France,</hi> and that GOD had taken that noble Prince, leaſt he ſhould ſee euill dayes, as the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> ſaith.</p>
               <p>It is ſayd before, how the Lord <hi>Lauerdine</hi> (who was maſter of the Campe) ſaued himſelfe by flight out of the ſlaughter of <hi>Coutras,</hi> &amp; betooke himſelfe to the towne of <hi>Niort,</hi> to the Lord <hi>Malicorne</hi> his vncle, where hée ſoiourned as his Lieutenant.</p>
               <p>Here (Chriſtian Reader) wee haue to obſerue, that although the King and the Leaguers hated in wardly one another, and in outward appearance did deepely diſſemble their affections; yet wee doo ſee, that as <hi>Herode</hi> and <hi>Pilate</hi> did excerciſe priuie hatred betweene them, and at length in perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Chriſt did well agree as friends: ſo in men of like degrées and in like actions the like affections are boyling in their hearts. For the rumour of the death of the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> and Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> (which the Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guers (hauing ſet ſome ſecret price vppon their heads) had promiſed vnto themſelues) did cauſe the King and the Leaguers in outward apparance
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:8966:114"/>
to be great friends, and to promiſe vnto themſelues an vtter rooting out of them of the religion, and a ſure ſubduing of all things beyond the riuer of <hi>Loyre.</hi> With ſpeede therefore they ſent eight or nine regiments conducted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1588. March"/> by the Lord <hi>Courbe,</hi> to the Lord <hi>Lauerdine,</hi> Lieutenant of his vncle the Lord <hi>Malicorne</hi> at <hi>Niort</hi> in <hi>Poytow,</hi> who with al the forces which he could gather both in the lowe and high <hi>Poytow,</hi> the 16. day of March about two a clocke after midnight, deſcended into <hi>Marans</hi> by boates through the mariſhes of <hi>Beauregard,</hi> and with fiue hundred footmen ſeazed vppon the houſe and farme of the ſayd <hi>Beauregard,</hi> hauing found no reſiſtance, but onely of two of the inhabitants of <hi>Marans,</hi> with a little boate who were gone to diſcouer the Iland <hi>Cicoigne:</hi> theſe two diſcharging their peeces vpon the enemies, retyred to the trenches of <hi>Beauregard,</hi> there they found but fiue or ſixe Souldiers, as well of the inhabitants as others, who alſo diſcharged certaine ſhot vpon the enemie, who notwithſtanding aduanced and came to land. The cauſe why the Lord <hi>Lauerdine</hi> ſubdued theſe I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands ſo eaſily, was, firſt the certayne newes of the death of the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and the rumours bruted abroade touching the ſuppoſed death of the King of <hi>Nauarre;</hi> which thing cauſed great amaze and diſcouraging a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all men. Secondly, the ill order and prouidence of the gouernour: for if he, his troups and inhabitants had done their duetie, <hi>Lauerdine</hi> had not entered that Iland at that price, or els had been chaſed out to his diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and loſſe. The Lord <hi>Iarry</hi> had béen aduertized three dayes before of the enterprize of <hi>Lauerdine,</hi> and might haue put into the Ilands forces ſufficient to reſiſt the enemie: for the companies of the Lord <hi>Trimouille</hi> conducted by the Lord <hi>Boyſduly,</hi> returning from <hi>Cotaudiere</hi> were very nigh him, to wit, at S. <hi>Radagond, Champaigne,</hi> and <hi>Puyreneau,</hi> who deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red nothing more then to enter into <hi>Marans.</hi> But the gouernour and the inhabitants fearing the preace of Souldiers (which was exceſſiue indeede) would not admit them, but ſent to <hi>Rochel</hi> the Captaine <hi>Plaute,</hi> Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the Gouernour, to requeſt them of <hi>Rochel</hi> to ſend them about fiftie Souldiers, whom they would entertayne, vntill they might ſee what the enemie would doo: which thing they of <hi>Rochel</hi> could not doo for that time.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding this refuſe, and that the gouernour was well aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, that he had not ſufficient forces to let y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> enemie to take land, yet the companies of the Lord <hi>Boyſduly</hi> paſſing through the <hi>Brault,</hi> were ſent further as farre as <hi>Eſuand,</hi> through foule wayes ouerthwart the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes, whereas they ſhould haue been ſtayed, to be vſed as the neceſſitie had required. They ſent notwithſtanding the ſame day at euening to the ſaid <hi>Boyſduly:</hi> but arriuing not before ten or eleuen a clock in the night, was the cauſe that ſuccour could not come in time, although that the diligence of the ſayd <hi>Boyſduly</hi> and his companies was wonderfull; for without any

For the L. <hi>Lauerdine</hi> was not yet well accompanyed, and it had beene an eaſie thing to cut the way to the reſt of his troupes which came in ſmall boates. But becauſe the Souldiers were marueilouſly wearie, they tooke incontinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their lodgings: the Captaines alſo did not think good to aſſault the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie by night, before they had diſcouered him.</p>
               <p>By this delay, the Lord <hi>Lauerdine</hi> receiued his footmen with leaſure, to the number of fiue hundred, without any horſemen, whome hee ſet in battell array in <hi>Beauregard,</hi> and placed about foure ſcore of them in the Farme houſe of <hi>Lommeau.</hi> The day being come, to wit, the 16. of March, the Lords <hi>Boyſduly</hi> and <hi>Iarry,</hi> and others Captaines, to number of three hundred footemen, and about three ſcore hrſemen, went to ſeeke out the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie, who put his men in battell array, in fauour of the Farme houſe of <hi>Beauregard,</hi> and durſt not aduance vpon our men, fearing our horſemen, although they were twiſe ſtronger in footmen. Our men on the other ſide durſt not charge them, hauing ſuch aduantage as they had, but for that time were content to chaſe them, who were put in the Farme houſe of <hi>Lommeau,</hi> who retyred to their fellowes in good order, as men reſolute. Our men on the other ſide, retyred to the towne, where euery one refre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed himſelfe, intending to charge the enemie in the euening, but there was noted in our men much confuſion, but ſmall reſolution.</p>
               <p>The ſame day about three a clock in the after noone arriued from <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel</hi> the Lord <hi>Noyſe,</hi> with twentie braue ſouldiers, vnder the conduct of Captaine <hi>Ozanneau:</hi> it is certaine that it theſe ſouldiers had arriued the day before, and had been placed at <hi>Beauregard,</hi> with ſome more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which might haue been geuen them, part of the inhabitants, &amp; part of the ſouldiers of the gouernour, the L. <hi>Lauerdine</hi> had not put foot on land ſo eaſily as he did. For although the Lord <hi>Lauerdine</hi> had gotten much (as is ſaid) yet he had beene enforced to retire, if it had not beene for the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thery committed in the forte of <hi>Baſtile,</hi> which commanded the captayne Enſigne of the gouernour and ſome others, who were ſo frighted by a countrie man, ſent vnto them by the way of aduertizement from <hi>Perrerio</hi>

with threatnings, that if they did ſuffer themſeues to be beſieged, they would be hanged as others were at <hi>Cotaudiere:</hi> that there upon they ſtat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not for the enemie, but abandoned their fort, their armour and muniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1588.

               <p>The Lord <hi>Lauerdine</hi> hauing intelligence of this fact, immediatly ſent for his horſemen, who were three long leagues off: they arriued about 5. a clock in the morning: he put all his men in battell array, and marched toward the towne of <hi>Marans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Lords <hi>Boyſduly</hi> and the gouernour, with other gentlemen and ſouldiers, prepared themſelues to goe to ſeeke the enemie, whome about ſix a clock they diſcouered with his horſemen, which made them conclude that without doubt the <hi>Baſtile</hi> was in their power: for it was vnpoſſible that their horſemen had entred any other way.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding, they which were in the towne, went foorth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the enemie to the fartheſt houſes of the high towne, where they fought a ſkirmiſh, in the which the Lord <hi>Boyſduly, Noyſe,</hi> and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who followed them, with ſome of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Rochell,</hi> did what they could: but at length being charged with horſemen of the enemie, were forced to giue place, and to retyre into the Caſtell ſpeedily, ſo that the enemie ſeazed vpon the high towne, and thereupon afterward became maſter of all the reſt.</p>
               <p>All the Gentlemen with their horſes and Souldiers, and ſome of the inhabitants retyred into the Caſtell, to the number of three or foure hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred. Within that place there was no prouiſion of victualls, ſaue ſome ſmall ſtore of meale, which the Souldiers in retyring therein could carry away with them. There was neither ſhouels, mattocks, picaxes, nor any other tooles, to remoue the earth if neede ſhould be: there was ſmall prouiſion for horſes, and no good ſtore of powder.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding, the Lord <hi>Boyſduly,</hi> with the gouernour and other Gentlemen, determined to hold out for certaine dayes, hoping to haue ſome ſuccour either by the comming of the king of <hi>Nauarre</hi> (who was not yet returned out of <hi>Gaſcoyne)</hi> or elſe by them of <hi>Rochell,</hi> or if the worſt ſhould fal out, yet they would make ſome honourable compoſition. With this reſolution they prepared to keepe the court of the Caſtel, which was in a manner trenched, and the dungeon hauing one piece which was little or nothing worth to them.</p>
               <p>There they were incontinently beſieged by the enemie, who ſeazed vpon all the conuenient places round about the Caſtell, and did commaund the court of the ſayd Caſtell: they trenched themſelues where it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient for them.</p>
               <p>They who were beſieged in the Caſtell did likewiſe their endeuor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo that without any loſſe of men they killed many of the enemies. The Lord

                  <hi>Iarry</hi> Gouernour was hurt in the foot, which made his perſon afterward vnprofitable.</p>
               <p>But the enemy preſſed them within ſo narrowly, that there could no <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1588. March"/> meanes be deuyſed to vnderſtand any thing during the ſiege.</p>
               <p>The 18. of March the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> haſting before his company, which followed him contrary to the opinion of many, came to <hi>Rochel</hi> with the Prince of <hi>Soyſſons,</hi> and ſome other noble men in good deliberation to ſuccour <hi>Marans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Afore his arryuing to <hi>Rochel,</hi> the inhabitantes thereof had ſent a good number of Harquebuziers, vnder the conduct of Captaine <hi>Gargoleau,</hi> and others, for to enter into <hi>Marans:</hi> but they vnderſtoode by the way, that the enemy poſſeſſed the Iland with the chiefeſt fortes, and had beſieged the Caſtell: for which cauſe they returned to <hi>Rochel.</hi> The Citizens of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel</hi> alſo had ſent two ſhippes with the barke of Captayne <hi>Courtault,</hi> and certayne Culuerings, vnder the conduct of Captayne <hi>Boyſſeau,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Souldiours and Captaynes. They entered into the riuer boldly, ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed vppon the forts of <hi>Brault</hi> and <hi>Clouſie,</hi> in the ſight of the enemy whom they preuented.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> informed of all thinges paſſed at <hi>Marans,</hi> the 19. day very early tooke his iourney to <hi>Charon,</hi> and from thence to the ſaid fortes, where he put men and munition a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The enemy hauing ſeazed vppon the whole towne, and trenched him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in the market houſe, ſeeing the preparing of the Shippes, preſented himſelf to withſtand the landing of them that came from <hi>Rochel,</hi> and with two field Péeces compelled the ſhips to deſcend lower: there were flayne ſome Souldiers of <hi>Rochel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> gaue all the ſignes that could be poſſible (as by the ſounding of Trompets, ſpyals, or other meanes) to let them who were beſieged vnderſtand of his comming. One of his ſpyals was hanged: but they within could not perceaue any thing, ſaue onely of the comming of the Ships, whom they ſuppoſed to haue béene the Rochellers only, but he could not conceaue any hope to be able to ſuccour them.</p>
               <p>The enemie in the meane while increaſed his forces, which repay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into the Iland out of euery ſide. Hee had alſo meanes to make fortes and trenches in diuers entringes of the Iland, to ſtop the ſuccour which might come to them within the Caſtell, and in the meane time preſſed them hard. The King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> on the other ſide receaued ſome for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as well them which had followed him out of <hi>Gaſcoyne,</hi> as other who repayred vnto him out of <hi>Poytow,</hi> and <hi>Xainctonge.</hi> All theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyes
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:8966:116"/>
together were fayre; and diſpoſed to do well: &amp; although the forces of the enemy were no leſſer, notwithſtanding he determined to enter into <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1588. March"/> the Iland. But hee found in the place (which he thought to be moſt eaſie) which before hee had viewed himſelfe, that the enemy had ſo entrenched himſelfe there, that it was impoſſible to force them without great loſſe of men; conſidering y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the moſt part of the way to come to the ſayd trenches, the Souldiers ſhould haue waded in the water to the waſt, &amp; the horſes to the ſaddle. The enemy alſo had ſet ſome Peeces vppon the bancke of the marſh, by the which they might greatly haue endamaged them that would haue gone about to paſſe: they had broken alſo ſome bridges to make the entring difficult.</p>
               <p>All theſe diſcommodityes conſidered, the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> choſe rather to ſaue his men to a better opportunity, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo dangerouſly to hazard them, without any helpe to them that were within the Caſtell, who might ſaue themſelues ſome other way: ſo he tooke his forces from <hi>Clouſy,</hi> and gaue it ouer.</p>
               <p>Hee kept onely the fort of <hi>Brault,</hi> the paſſage into the low <hi>Poytow,</hi> which notwithſtanding two or three dayes after came in the power of the enemie.</p>
               <p>The enemy waxed ſtronger and ſtronger dayly, becauſe the caſtell refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed parley, and harkened to nothing but to defend themſelues, ſeeing no Ordinance.</p>
               <p>At length the Lord <hi>Lauerdine</hi> had three Pieces brought from <hi>Niort,</hi> which he ſet againſt the caſtell the 24. of March. The firſt battery was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt a rownd tower, which maketh one of the corners of the Caſtell to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the towne: and with ſhot did ſo enlarge a window which was garni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with a Lattice of Iron, that he enforced the Rochellers to forſake it: they ſhot alſo agaynſt the tower of the gate, and in other places here and there without hurting any man, although that place be very ill for the ſhot of Ordinance.</p>
               <p>They which commaunded in the Caſtell, and many Souldyers lacked no courage (although they wanted many thinges neceſſary to aſſiſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in defence of a naughty place) but as the affections are diuers, ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in a company confuſed, as that was within the Caſtell: ſo one gaue counſell one way, another another way: at length they came to that iſſue, that they would ſurrender the place, but vpon ſuch tearms and conditions as ſhould not be diſhonorable vnto them.</p>
               <p>The reaſons of this reſolution were, that they had promiſed, and ſo ſent word to <hi>Rochel</hi> that they might hold eight dayes and no longer without ſuccour. The tearme was expired, they had no more bread but for two dayes, and yet was not there ynough for all. Many of their horſes were dead for hunger, which did infect them with the ſtinke: there happened alſo

The dungeon beeing very little, the fall of the walles did quell them, and that which was woorſt of all, they heard no newes of the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> but onely what <hi>Lauerdine</hi> told them, who made them beleeue that he was ſtill in <hi>Gaſcoyne:</hi> and although they belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued not the wordes of the enemy, yet did they ſee nothing to perſwade them to the contrary.</p>
               <p>The enemy on the other ſide fearing to be forced by the king of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> offered them honeſt and good ſuretyes for the performance of the offers, ſo that they did chooſe rather to take him in that mood (ſeeing that they muſt yeeld) then to expect greater extremity which might <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>That there ſhould goe forth all gentlemen, Souldiers, and inhabitantes, with their armor, horſes and ſtuffe, and ſhould be ſafely conducted whither they would, which was faithfully kept by the Lord <hi>Lauerdine,</hi> in the taile: notwithſtanding, ſome ſouldiers were ſpoiled of their good, but few.</p>
               <p>The Iland of <hi>Marans</hi> being ſo reduced into the hand of the Leaguers, the Lord <hi>Cluſeaulx,</hi> otherwiſe called <hi>Blanchard,</hi> obtayned the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that place, which he kept about two moneths.</p>

There were taken more then two hundred horſes, among whome were found twentie or fiue and twentie of the faireſt in all the armie, and many of them had coſt the Baron one thouſand crownes a piece: hee eſteemed the loſſe which hee had ſuſtained in that charge, in horſes, plate, money, and mony worth, at more then thirtie thouſand Crownes.</p>

               <p>The Ducheſſe of <hi>Boillon</hi> hauing receaued the newes of that vnlooked or victorie, accompanied with other Ladies of calling, who were exiled for the teſtimonie of the truth, and ſoiourned at <hi>Sedan,</hi> went to the gate called <hi>Meſuil,</hi> to giue thankes to the Gentlemen and Captaines, for the nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

               <p>The Lord <hi>Nieuile</hi> preſented her two Enſignes, &amp; two Cornets which they had gotten, which ſhe receaued thankfully, &amp; incontinently the whole companie with the people went to the temple, where thankes were giuen to God for this happie ſucceſſe: this was about noone.</p>
               <p>This ouerthrowe did not quench the fire, but rather did kindle the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the army which was before <hi>Iamets,</hi> ſo that they doubled their rage, labour and battery, which they had continued from the ninth day of Aprill, and neuer ceaſed to thunder, vntill the ſixteenth day of the ſame moneth, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

As they without prepared themſelues to giue the aſſault, ſo they within prepared all things neceſſarie, with courage to receaue them: it was not poſſible to doo more valiantly, then botl, Captaine and Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours did; the more worthie praiſe, that in the middeſt of armes (which they acknowledged of themſelues but vncertaine and weake) they put their whole hope and confidence of their preſeruation onely in God, the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder of the oppreſſed, and the defender of their iuſt quarell.</p>
               <p>Such hope did not deceaue them, for the enemies hauing done their batterie, to the number of twelue volleys of Ordinance, the ſame day in a moment they cloſed themſelues in battell aray, and headlong ſet as wel on the breach, as on the curtine toward the tower, called the Cat, where they planted a great number of ladders, with a full aſſurance to carry the towne away by one way or other: but they were ſo couragiouſly receaued, that after a long fight they were ſo beaten, driuen backe, and ouerthrowen, that the Towne ditch remayned full of a great number of dead &amp; wounded: few were taken priſoners by them of the towne, for they did driue them before, ſtill beating them vnto their trenches, ſo that no man was able to repaſſe the heate and furie of the Souldiers following the victory: one halfe of theyr army was there wholly deſtroyed.</p>
               <p>Of them of the towne were not aboue ſixe ſlaine, and eight hurt: a thing very ſtrange and yet moſt true. God for to magnify his power in taking vengeance vpon tyrantes and haughty perſons, oftentimes doth ouercome as well with a ſmall as with a great number: and ſo was that the onely vertue and force of his arme, to whom the victorious gaue the glory: for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the retire from the fight they gaue publikly thankes to the diuine good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of God, who ſo mightily had deliuered them.</p>

               <p>In the twelfth Chapter of the <hi>Actes,</hi> there it is ſhewed how a King killed <hi>Iames,</hi> ſeeing that it pleaſed well the people (to get their loue to the vttermoſt) tooke <hi>Peter</hi> alſo, intending to kill him like wiſe: ſo this King (with dutiful reuerence of the ſoueraigne power be it ſpoken, in comparing the counſels and actions, not the perſons) determined to recouer the loue of his ſubiects by the ſlaughter of the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> Nobility and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which follow the example of <hi>Peter,</hi> and imbrace the ſame forme of doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine which he hath deliuered.

               <p>On the other ſide, the King liued in ſecuritie voyde of any ſuſpition of treachery of the people of <hi>Paris,</hi> who made his right hand of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as whom he had alwaies cheriſhed &amp; loued as himſelf, and more regarded in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner then all the reſt of his kingdome.</p>
               <p>But as counſells which doo drawe after ſuch haughtie euents cannot long bee kept cloſe, but doo take winde; ſo the déepe prouidence of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the League could not take ſo good order, (being not able to execute any thing alone) but diſtruſt began to riſe in the hearts of many men who were faithfull to the King: ſo that after diuers mutterings, ſundrie aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſements were giuen to the King, that there was ſome great matter in hand againſt his perſon and eſtate.

               <p>The Duke of <hi>Guize</hi> hearing how he was expected in <hi>Paris,</hi> both by the mutinous citizens and ſtraungers, who vpon aduertiſements giuen them, had flocked thether out of diuers parts of the Realme: and vnderſtanding that the King had ſent his forces into <hi>Picardie</hi> and <hi>Normandy,</hi> reſolued himſelfe to goe to <hi>Paris</hi> with a ſmall companie for to auoyd ſuſpition, yet aſſured to finde there (as in a little world) a number of partakers, proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of all neceſſarie things, and in readines ſufficient to ſurpriſe a great King.</p>
               <p>The King informed of this deliberation of <hi>Guize</hi> to come to <hi>Paris,</hi> and deſirous (as is ſayd before) to preuent all their attempts by gracious waies, about the eight day of May ſent the Lord <hi>Belieure</hi> to the ſaid Duke whom he met at <hi>Soyſſons,</hi> to informe him of his will, that his comming to <hi>Paris</hi> would not bee agreeable to his Maieſtie; willing him in the Kings

name for that time not to come to <hi>Paris;</hi> and beſide, the king commaunded the ſayd <hi>Belieure,</hi> that in (caſe the ſayd Duke would néedes continue his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1588.

               <p>The Lord <hi>Belieure</hi> gaue notice of all the Kings will and intent vnto the ſayd Duke, as he was charged to doo. The Duke ſubtilly gaue him a doubtfull anſwere, not declaring whether he would goe or not: but as the water being ſtopped waxeth ſtronger and more violent; ſo the prohibiting of him encreaſed his heate; and ambition by nature impatient, and made him thinke that the delay was an irreuocable loſſe.</p>

               <p>The King being aduertiſed of the Dukes comming to <hi>Paris,</hi> tooke great diſcontentation therof, &amp; conceaued a great diſpleaſure againſt the ſaid <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieure,</hi> as though he had not faithfully deliuered his commandement, and in the ſame tearmes as he was charged, to the Duke of <hi>Guize.</hi>

               <p>This ſolitarie comming of the Duke of <hi>Guize</hi> encreaſed the ſuſpitions and miſtruſt, making euery man that knewe him and his pompe, thinke that ſuch extraordinarie comming had ſome myſterie, which ere it were long ſhould be reuealed. For if it had been ſimple and without fraude, a cooling of the partakers had enſued (as commonly they who doo obey doo frame their actions, according to the manners of them which doo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand) ſo that ſuch a tumult had not inſued it as did.</p>
               <p>A little while after the arriuing of the Duke of <hi>Guize,</hi> the <hi>Q. Mother</hi> cauſed her ſelfe to bee carried to the <hi>Loure</hi> to ſpeake with the King. The <hi>Guize</hi> with a ſmall companie to ſee too, followed the <hi>Q.

               <p>The <hi>Q.

Fewe would haue iudged by this interuiew, that there had been ſo dangerous vlcers in their hearts: the King greatly diſpleaſed at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1588.

In making this anſwer, he ſeemed very much moued, and pale, as though he had feared that the King euen then would take puniſhment of that contempt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he had deſpiſed his commaundement.</p>
               <p>The King relyed, that he had ſent him an expreſſe commaundement, that he ſhould not come for that time. The Duke made anſwer, that it was not told him in ſuch ſort, as that hee had occaſion to feare that his comming ſhould bee ſo diſagreeable to him. The King then turning his ſpeach to the Lord <hi>Belieure,</hi> aſked him whether he had not commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him to make him vnderſtand his intention. When <hi>Belieure</hi> would haue recounted, in what ſort hee performed his meſſage, the Duke of <hi>Guize</hi> interrupted him, and ſaid to the King, ſpeaking by <hi>Belieure,</hi> that he had tolde him more.</p>
               <p>Vpon this, the <hi>Q.

               <p>The tenth day he commaunded the Eſcheuins, that is the Aldermen, and chiefeſt men of the Citie, to make ſearch through the Citie in all hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, of all ſuch men as were to be found, without any lawfull buſines: they diſſembled the matter, as though they had good liking thereof.

               <p>The ſame day, the Maſter of the League, that is the Duke of <hi>Guize,</hi>

At the arriuing of them, the Pariſians gaue themſelues the ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, and faigned great feare, as though the great Turke had entred the Citie with an hundred thouſand men, euery man ran into his houſe, ſhut vp their doores and windowes many cried that they were loſt, vndone, and would be all murthered. It had been an eaſie thing for the King if he had had an euill intent againſt them (as afterward they made themſelues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue) to haue let the attempt, which they did that ſame day, in raiſing and trenching themſelues againſt their King. But the King was accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to vſe patiencie and long delayes, euen in the middeſt of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt.</p>
               <p>The Kings forces being entred the Citie, were by his commandement vnder the conduct of the Lord <hi>Byron,</hi> diſtributed into diuers plares of the Citie, not to enterpriſe or to offend any man, but there to holde faſt, leaſt that any mutinie ſhould riſe in the Citie, as all things ſeemed apparant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to bée diſpoſed by the comming of the Duke of <hi>Guize.</hi> Part of thoſe forces were appoynted to be about the King, to fortifie his gardes: and another part was placed at Saint <hi>Ihan de Greue,</hi> before the common houſe of the Citie, vnder the conduct of Marſhall <hi>Haumont,</hi> the Prouoſt of Marchants, and other of the chiefeſt of the Citie, who knew the Kings intent.

               <p>This diuiſion of the Kings forces was well made, for that end to the which it was done, but it was not vniuerſall, nor in ſome ſpeciall places, where the neceſſitie did ſpecially require.

And that place was of ſuch importance, that being ſeazed vpon, it might be the meanes to recouer all the others: but yet if it had béene prouided with one hundred Pikes, and thirtie Harquebuſiers, they had béen ſufficient to let them for a time, who would ſtirre.

               <p>The Duke of <hi>Guize</hi> vnderſtanding that the Kings forces were ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a ſunder, and diſpoſed in certaine places, knowing his partakers to bée ſtronger, and more in number without compariſon, trenched with Barrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos, hard by the Kings Gariſons, ſet in diuers places (as is before ſaide) euen with thirtie paces one from the other, and perceauing that all this while a ſléep, he had incloſed vp the Kings forces on euery ſide: how much more can he doo, awaking out of his bed, if he would beſtirre himſelfe about his buſines: now ſéeing that it reſteth no more, but to charge and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch the Kings forces, that deſtitute of all ſuccour, more eaſily he may be had out of the <hi>Loure</hi> dead or a liue, reſteth therefore but the watch word to begin the may game.</p>
               <p>All things being in a readines, two ſorts of men are appoynted, the one to giue the watch word, the other to giue the firſt blowe. The watch word was giuen by interpoſed perſons, who went about the Citie, reporting that the King would eſtabliſh new Gariſons in the Citie, and executt one hundred of the chiefeſt inhabitants, and many other noble men at the ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion of the Duke <hi>Eſpernon,</hi> who had intelligences with the King of <hi>Nauarre.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Others were interpoſed among the Kings French Souldiers, who did bid the inhabitants to lay cleane ſheetes in their beds, for the ſame night
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:8966:124"/>
they would lye in their houſes. On a ſuddaine therefore the fire was ſet to the myne, in a moment <hi>Paris</hi> was fired into an horrible and confuſed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1588. May"/> commotion, and as if there had been queſtion to run vpon the enemy, euery man doth prepare himſelfe to ſet vpon the Kings gardes, and the reſt of his forces.</p>
               <p>The others (who were appoynted to beginne the fray) were <hi>Briſſak, Boyſdauphin, Chamoyes,</hi> and other partakers of <hi>Guyze,</hi> who at the watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>word geuen, began to charge the Swiſſers, whereof ſome were killed, ſome vnarmed: the like was done to the other companies of Frenchmen, many were ſlaine, and all vnarmed.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Guyze</hi> wayting a ſleepe for this beginning, ſtarted vp (as he ſayd) out of his ſleepe, ranne to the fray, ſhewed a double dilligence, did endeuor to ſhew outwardly to the world, that hee enterpriſed nothing, and that he was vtterly ignorant of all theſe thinges: and to that end hee might haue witnes, he cauſed the ſlaughter which was made of the Swiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers to ſeaſe, cauſed the armes to bee rendred to the Kinges companies, who had béen vnarmed: but after ſuch a maner as did ſhew how much greater regard they of <hi>Paris</hi> had of him then of the King, and what intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligences hee had with them, whereof hee did ſhew himſelfe not diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented.</p>
               <p>In that commotion ſome would haue killed the Marſhal <hi>Biron,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Belieure,</hi> which thing this King of the may game miſliked, &amp; would not ſuffer. Such occaſions did content him greatly, for by ſuch actions he confirmed himſelfe in the truſt and confidence which he had in that people: he would alſo haue them whom he ſaued from the ſlaughter, to beleeue that he had no ſmall part in <hi>France:</hi> &amp; beſides that he bound them to him in as much as their liues were woorth. To be ſhort, no man was in danger of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rage of the people, who either was with him, or was commended by him.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Guyze,</hi> after the vnarming of the Kinges compan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The King being aduertized of all which was a dooing, did not ſhew himſelf mooued therwith at all. But the 2. Quéenes were greatly amazed, ſpecially the <hi>Q Mother,</hi> which all the dinner tyme did nothing elſe but weepe, with great aboundance of tears. And immediatly after dinner ſhe tooke her coach to goe to the houſe of <hi>Guyze,</hi> where the ſayd Lord of <hi>Guyze</hi> had retyred, after hauing taken priſoners the Kings forces, to do her beſt endeuor to paſſify the commotion, but it was without any effect: for they who heretofore had in admiration her deuiliſh craftines, as a diuine wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, did now when they had the vpper hand account it a deceitfull Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an diſſimulation. So that old <hi>Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="236" facs="tcp:8966:125"/>
For ſhee her ſelfe with much adoo could paſſe through the ſtreates ſo thicke trenched with Barricados, that ſhee was enforced to forſake her Coach and be carryed in a chayre: and euery varlet would preſume to bid <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1588. May"/> her ſtay, what will you haue? whether goe you? and opening the way on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for her chayre, did bid her goe her way.</p>
               <p>As the ſeditious made all thinges in a readines to beſiege the King in the <hi>Loure</hi> the next day, the Duke of <hi>Guyze</hi> went out of his houſe to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe to himſelfe ſome good will of the Maſter, by ſhewing ſome curteſy to the ſeruantes, and came to the place where the Kinges forces were ſtayed and vnarmed, in the euening cauſed theyr armes to be rendered them. He ſent one Saint <hi>Paul</hi> (who had growen from a latrey to be a great man, and greatly fauored by the Duke of <hi>Guyze)</hi> to go before the Kings gards, leading them as captiues in a tryumph, and commaunded them to be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned out of Saint <hi>Anthonies</hi> gate, and to ſhift for themſelues.</p>
               <p>The night following, the Rebels beſieged the <hi>Loure,</hi> where the King was, ſet their Barricados nigh the gace, ſtopped the iſſues, ſkirmiſhed with them that came foorth: and yet all thinges are ſo diſguiſed, that to beſiege the King and kill him in his owne houſe, to execute it dilligently, and that without ſparing the life of any man, at the commaundement of <hi>Guyze,</hi> is to obay the King, to defend the King and the countrey, to fight for liberty, to expoſe valiantly their liues for their tempels, their altars, theyr wiues and children.</p>
               <p>The morrow after, as the tumult increaſed, the King had aduertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from two ſeuerall places (the firſt by one who was familiar, and houſhold ſeruant to the Lord of <hi>Guyze:</hi> the ſecond by a gentleman of good calling) that the ſayd <hi>Guyze,</hi> and they of <hi>Paris</hi> his partakers, had determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to bring foorth the night following fifteene or ſixteene thouſand men by the new gate, and other gates of that ſide of the Citty, to beſiege him without, there to ſtop all paſſage, and to force him in his houſe.</p>
               <p>The King receaued confirmation of the ſame determination by one of his faithfull ſeruants, a man of honor and vnderſtanding, who labored much to cauſe one of his ſeruantes to ſtep to the <hi>Loure</hi> for that purpoſe, who could not haue brought it to paſſe if it had not béene by the helpe of one of the Captaynes of the wardes of the City, who conducted the meſſenger to the <hi>Loure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King did ſtep aſyde to receaue this meſſage by the mouth of him which brought it: which when hee vnderſtood, iudged the miſchiefe and daunger to be greater then hee had thought, and began to be amazed (ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which hee would neuer haue expected of the Pariſiens) without ſhewing any token of diſmay.</p>
               <p>He was alſo aduiſed at the ſame inſtant, to get him out of <hi>Paris,</hi> though he ſhould goe foorth alone, if not he would be vndone, and that when his
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:8966:125"/>
perſon ſhould be without, he might find many ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts &amp; faithfull ſubiects.</p>
               <p>The K. did not refuſe that counſell, for he ſaw the danger to encreaſe euery moment, and yet he made no great ſhew to follow it. But on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1588. May"/> encreaſing the aſſurance of his countenance, did ſeeme to promiſe ſhortly to remedy it.</p>
               <p>He ſent the <hi>Q. Mother</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Guyze</hi> once again: ſhee with much a doe, hauing acceſſe to him, exhorted him to bring of his owne ſo much as he could to pacifie that commotion, prayed him very inſtantly to come to the king with great proteſtation of aſſurance, that he would bee well pleaſed thereof, proteſting of his good will and confidence which he repoſed in him.</p>
               <p>The King delayed his departing out of <hi>Paris,</hi> meditating reuenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vpon the head of this rebellion, and had ſent his mother to the ende to haue drawen him within his reach, ſuppoſing that the head being off, the members would coole and waxe weake.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Q Mother</hi> ſeing that he was not moued by her wordes, ſendeth his anſwere to the king, by the ſecretary <hi>Pinart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King being aduertized of the hardnes of the Duke, &amp; out of hope to execute his will vpon him. To preuent a farther miſchiefe which hee ſaw to be at hand, commaunded his companies to retire, and determined to goe out of <hi>Paris,</hi> and to take his farwell of the <hi>Loure,</hi> at the perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of many officers of the Crowne, who gaue him counſell to giue place to that deſperate conſpiracie, and to retyre into a place of ſafety: he ſent his houſehold to the place called the <hi>Tuilleries,</hi> and leauing the <hi>Q. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> there in the <hi>Loure,</hi> went foorth out of <hi>Paris</hi> on that ſide which was moſt ſure for him, to wit, through newgate with a walking ſtaffe in his hand, as though he went (according to his cuſtome) to walke to the <hi>Tuilleries</hi> with as ioyful countenance, as in the moſt ioyful day that could ſhine vnto him.</p>
               <p>When he was out of the gate, he turned his face toward that citie, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting foorth certaine ſpeaches of indignation, with proteſtation againſt their ingratefulnes, treachery, and treaſon. When he came to the <hi>Tuil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries,</hi> he tooke his horſe with them of his trayne, who had meanes to get
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:8966:126"/>
horſes, they who had none either ſtayed behinde, or elſe followed him on foote. Many great Lordes went after him on foote, vntill they had the meanes to get horſes. Many great Lordes and gentlemen of the Kinges <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1588. May"/> ſide went out of <hi>Paris</hi> in great haſte, ſome without bootes, ſome deſtitute of all things, euerie one vnder the ſhadowe of ſome friend, ſuch as they met withall in the middle of the confuſed preaſe.</p>
               <p>The King that night, went to <hi>Trappes,</hi> and lodged in the houſe of <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile,</hi> brother to <hi>Mommorency,</hi> and alyed to the Duke <hi>d'Eſpernon.</hi> The flight of ſuch a great King, ſo vngratefully dealt with all, by them whome he had ſo greatly fauored, was lamentable.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Guize</hi> hauing remoued the Kings power from him, partly by killing, and partly by ſending others another cleane contrary way from the King, ſuppoſing that the ſaid King had beene ſtill in the <hi>Loure,</hi> and knowing that there reſted nothing more to doo, but to haue his perſon for a gage of the Crowne, determined to beſiege the <hi>Loure,</hi> and to bring out of hand the Artilery before the gate. But vnderſtanding that he was iſſued out, and gone already a great way of, hee remayned Maſter of <hi>Paris,</hi> ſéeing that the Maſter and the ſeruants had yeelded him the lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging.</p>
               <p>Hetherto wee haue conducted the King to <hi>Trappes,</hi> and his forces are ſent packing, and the Duke maketh merrie in <hi>Paris,</hi> in hope likewiſe to be Maſter of all the reſt.</p>
               <p>The Duke and his partakers, perceauing how the King had giuen the ſlip, and auoyded their bloudie hands, doo ſcratch their heads, and ſee their error: for although the ouerthrow was great, yet the victorie was not full, the enterpriſe not well executed, and the King being not taken, the iſſue thereof was doubtfull and full of perplexitie. For their conſciences doo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent before their eyes, the perfidious rebellion which they had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, as to haue not onely diſpoſſeſſed him of his houſe, of whome they holde all that euer they had, but alſo to haue ſought to murther him whom God had conſecrated, to repreſent before their eyes, the image of his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne iuſtice, to deſtroy their Prince, who had loued them ſo tenderlie; their benefactor, who had cheriſhed them as a Father his owne naturall Children. They accurſe their negligent folly, in that they had not beene more watchfull to attend vpon his perſon: feare ſeazed their hearts, when conſidering the greatnes of their offence, doo alſo knowe, that yet hee will haue meanes inough to bring their dooings to iudgement, and to take re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uengement of them, according to the haynouſnes of their offence. To be ſhort, they are very ſory, not for that which they had done, but for that they haue not done worſe.</p>
               <p>But the Duke of <hi>Guize</hi> conſidering well that the ſtincking fame of his villanous fact would flee abroade vnto the eares of forraine Princes, who

               </p>
               <p>The Ambaſſador anſwered, that he could eaſilie beleeue that he ſaide as he thought, but that hauty and hard enterpriſes, oftentimes doo remayne incommunicable, and cloſely ſhut vp in the hearts of them who doo enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe them, which alſo when they thinke good, doo produce them forth with ſuch colour, as they iudge moſt fit for their aduantage.

Euery man may iudge in what diſtreſſe of minde this great King paſſed all that night full of iuſt indignation of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, which although in outward apparance it might be kept cloſe, yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly inhart it could not be diſſembled.</p>
               <p>The ſelfe ſame day of the tumult in <hi>Paris,</hi> the Duke <hi>de Mayne</hi> attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vppon <hi>Lyons;</hi> but he was put backe by the inhabitantes.</p>
               <p>About the ſame time alſo the inhabitantes of <hi>Orleans, Anious, Bourges, Abeuille,</hi> and in other places did expell the Kings garriſons and officers, with the Citizens who did hold with the King, whom they did call poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes, and many of them were taken priſoners.</p>
               <p>The thirteenth day the King went to the Citty of <hi>Chartres,</hi> where ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his faythfull ſeruantes reſorted to him, and alſo his gardes, which had eſcaped the ſlaughter of <hi>Paris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Guyze</hi> (though very ſory, that ſo fooliſhly hee had miſſed to take the King in the <hi>Loure,</hi> as he made his ful reckoning the day before) followed the victory as well as hee could; and firſt beginneth to play the good huſband in <hi>Paris,</hi> to further the affayres to the premeditate intent.

               <p>The ſame daye alſo hee tooke the Kinges Arſeuall at the <hi>Baſtile,</hi> and ſealed vp the Kings treaſury, and in hope ſhortly to make all his owne: in the meane time hee will carry the key.</p>
               <p>When the Duke of <hi>Guyze</hi> had ſo played the good huſband: now hee will trie in a ſmall matter how hee can play the Kings part in great and waighty matters.

               <p>But the Leaguers lifted vp their heads, thes ſtoutnes and high courage of the Duke of <hi>Guyze</hi> was in the mouthes of them of his faction: but ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Prieſtes, Monkes, and Ieſuits did in their Pulpits extoll him to heauen: and vpon the newes of this exploit done in <hi>Paris,</hi> by the aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizements which the Duke of <hi>Guyze</hi> gaue euery where, but ſpecially by the preaching of the Friers and Ieſuits, the partakers make them ſelues ready to battaile.</p>
               <p>A ſudden feare came vpon the Duke of <hi>Guiz,</hi> and them of <hi>Paris</hi> his partakers: for after the Kings departure from <hi>Paris,</hi> they conſidering their error, and that now they are further to execute their enterprize vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his perſon than euer they were: the guiltines of their conſciences doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent to them the reuengement, and the King making already (as they ſee in their fearfull viſion) an agreement of peace with the King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarre,</hi> and calling him with his forces to his ayde to chaſtize them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their deſerts: Therefore they ſent preſently to their partakers to arme themſelues: The Fryers and Ieſuites ſound the allarum euery where, their ſeditious and impudent tongues ſeruing them for trompets, and their pulpits for a drumme, and giue the <hi>rendes vous</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> about the perſon of the Duke of <hi>Guyze.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the Duke had ſo played the good huſband, and had no more to take, and had played the king in altring the ſtate of the citie, and ſeazing vpon the kinges arſeuall and treaſurie, and had ſhewed himſelfe a good prouident Captaine, yet conſidering that in a little while the king was like to wax ſtronger than the Leaguers, ſpecially if he ſhould ioyne him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to the king of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> whoſe name they not onely hated, but alſo feared extreamly: in the meane while they goe about both to ſtrengthen themſelues, and to amend their error as well as they can, eſpetially three maner of wayes; by letters, by ſpyalls, and ſeeking the way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiliation.</p>

                  <pb n="243" facs="tcp:8966:128"/>
As for the letters, the Duke himſelfe playeth the ſecretary, to ſhewe how pretily he can ſkill of that occupation when it pleaſeth him. And for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1588.

               <p>Secondly, he boaſted to haue defeated the Swiſſers, and cut to peeces the Kings guardes.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, he braggeth that he was ready to haue beſieged the King in the <hi>Loure,</hi> making his reckoning to haue either taken him, or ſlain him there. But ſeeing that the king had beguiled him in flying away by ſtealth, hee referreth that matter till an other time.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all, he ſheweth that he hath determined to ſeaze all that which the king hath in <hi>Paris,</hi> vntill he be called to accounts. The copie of this letter was ſent the 14. day of May to the Gentlemen of the League in the Bayliwikes of <hi>Orleans</hi> and <hi>Bloys,</hi> who immediatly tooke their horſes to repayre to <hi>Boyſgency,</hi> where the gouernour had giuen the <hi>rendes vous.</hi> But the 15. day they receiued a contrary aduertiſement by a letter which the ſayd gouernour ſent them, contayning as followeth.</p>
               <p>Our great Duke could not execute his enterpriſe, the K. hauing retyred to <hi>Chartres:</hi> wherefore I cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſell you to retyre into your houſes as ſoftly as you may, making no ſemblance to haue ſeen any thing.

               <p>With the ſelfe ſame pen he wrote alſo a letter to the Lord <hi>Boſſempiere,</hi> in the which he boaſteth of his exployt done at <hi>Paris.</hi>

               <p>Firſt, how he hath diſcomfited the Kings forces of Swiſſers &amp; French men, who were beſtowed in certaine places of the Citie, and after how the ſayd companies are beholding to him by ſauing their liues, armours and goods.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he reioyceth of the great good will, obedience and reuerence of the perſons ſhewed vnto him in that commotion.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, he complaineth how he hath béen aſſaulted by the practiſes of the heretickes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="244" facs="tcp:8966:129"/>
Fourthly, he acknowledgeth to haue béen preſerued by the brauerie and valiantnes of them of <hi>Paris,</hi> of whom he aſſureth himſelfe for euer. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1588. May"/>
               </p>
               <p>Fiftly, he maketh a compariſon betwéene the King and himſelfe in theſe words: The King gathereth forces and we alſo; the King is at <hi>Chartres,</hi> and we in <hi>Paris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixtly, he boaſteth how he hath changed the ſtate of the Citie. And laſt of all, ſheweth that euery where the Townes and Cities about doo ſend to acknowledge him. Alſo, praieth the ſayd <hi>Boſſempiere</hi> to come to ſee him, where he ſhall finde him very luſtie with forces, courage, friends, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney enough to make merrie withall. To thoſe kinde of people whom he durſt truſt, hee wrote in plaine tearmes with a plaine pen what his minde and intent was. But writing vnto ſome friends in whom he thought that there was ſome french heart and nature, and therefore could not truſt them ſo farre as to commit the thoughts of his hart vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in plaine tearmes, he taketh another pen which could diſguiſe the matter, by the which he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth about ſo to colour his actions, as to make them beléeue that they are all iuſt and lawfull.</p>
               <p>Firſt, hee deriueth the occaſion of all the things which had happened from him and his ambition, vpon the Duke <hi>Eſpernon,</hi> whom indéede he knewe to bee one of the faithfulleſt ſeruants to the King of all his Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes, whom hee would faine haue to be put out of countenance, ſuppoſing that if he were not, he might doo with the King what he would, and rid him eaſily out of the way.</p>
               <p>Therefore hee blameth the Duke <hi>Eſpernon</hi> to haue ſearched out the meanes to let the Dukes iourney into <hi>Guienne,</hi> agaynſt the King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarre,</hi> whether he fained himſelfe to haue béen deſirous to goe and to haue had that charge.</p>
               <p>Secondly, to bring theſe things to paſſe, he chargeth him to haue gone into <hi>Picardie</hi> and <hi>Normandie,</hi> with part of the Kings forces, to picke qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rells, to refreſh olde inormities, thereby to diuert the kings power from <hi>Guienne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, he accuſeth the ſaid <hi>Eſpernon,</hi> that to that intent he would haue deriued the warre againſt the Duke of <hi>Guize,</hi> and the reſt of the League, by reporting and perſwading the King, that the ſayd Duke intended to make a ſlaughter of the Kings friends in the Citie of <hi>Paris,</hi> and there ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to kill, or to take the King priſoner, and to ranſacke the Citie, to make money to warre againſt whom he ſhould thinke good.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, he accuſeth the king of raſhneſſe, for beléeuing thoſe reports, and for that thereupon he encreaſed his forces in <hi>Paris,</hi> and for his ſtealing away out of <hi>Paris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fiftly, hee ſheweth how thinges paſſed in that commotion, ſo that hee waſheth ſtill his hands, and is in no fault, and the King and <hi>Eſpernon</hi> bée
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:8966:129"/>
the procurers of all that hath paſſed of late in <hi>Paris:</hi> and that if it had not béen for his wiſedome and care, the King had béen vndone, and the ſtate in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1588. May"/> extreame danger.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all, hee hopeth that the King will be a good boy, and if not, hee will make him a boy indeede.</p>
               <p>With the ſelfe ſame pen he writeth to the Townes and Cities of his confederacie, and ſuppoſing them to be of diuers diſpoſitions, to ſo many as may by his actions enter into his thoughts, to them he ſaith nothing of that which hath paſſed in <hi>Paris,</hi> leauing the report thereof to ſuch as were his truſtie friends in the ſayd Cities, thereby to colour his actions with lyes and ſurmiſes. Therefore he ſpecially without naming him, imputeth all theſe vprores which haue béen in <hi>Paris</hi> to the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> who for to diuert the warre from himſelfe, hath ſent (ſaith he) diuers expreſſe gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, and alſo hath laboured to the ſame purpoſe them who were at his deuotion about the King, who haue gone about to perſwade the King to warre againſt the Leaguers.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he exhorteth them at the example of <hi>Paris,</hi> to ſuffer no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of garriſons to be put into their Townes and Cities.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, he prayeth them that they will ioyne their meanes and willes with him and the Citty of <hi>Paris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The inhabitants of <hi>Paris</hi> borrowed the ſame penne of the Duke of <hi>Guyze,</hi> to write with the ſelfe ſame ſtile as hee had done therewith.</p>
               <p>And namely, they do charge the Duke <hi>Eſpernon</hi> as a ſecret friend to the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> to haue procured the King firſt to bring forces and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed garriſons within the Cittie of <hi>Paris:</hi> by which occaſion, the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny and commotion had enſued. Then to haue perſwaded the King in theſe tumults to ſuſpect the inhabitants of the ſayd City, and at length to haue counſelled him to flee from <hi>Paris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, they ſtirre vp the Cities and Towns of their confederacie, to make like vprores agaynſt the King and his forces, as they haue done, warning them, that now the time is come that they ought to liue and dye together, to bring to paſſe their intents.</p>
               <p>Thus the Duke of <hi>Guyze</hi> with his Pariſiens, hauing diſpatched thoſe thinges which they thought neceſſary either to ſtrengthen or excuſe their actions. Now he taketh in hand the third pen to write to the King, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he powreth out the words of a faithfull ſeruant, and in diſguiſing his enterprize goeth about to deceaue him, &amp; to lul him aſleep: but to do it with good grace in his <hi>exordium</hi> hee doth chafe &amp; braule firſt, for feare the King ſhould haue that aduantage ouer him as to begin with him. And although this his laſt action did openly ſhew the intentes of al his former dealings, he muſt diſſemble and make the words of ſeruice &amp; obedience ſound high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. There he doth lament, and almoſt fall a weeping <hi>(Crocodils lacrymis)</hi>
                  <pb n="246" facs="tcp:8966:130"/>
for his eſtate, that by reaſon of the ſlaunders of his aduerſaries, he hath béen rendered ſuſpect to the King of the cryme of high treaſon.</p>
               <p>Secondly, to make his innocency appeare, he ſheweth how he came to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1588. May"/> him with a ſmall company to iuſtify his actions.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, he blameth the King that he would harken to his enemies, who cauſed him to put extraordinary forces in <hi>Paris,</hi> and to diſpoſe them into the cheefeſt places of the ſayd Citty, and that he would be mooued by their perſwaſions to make ſuch an exemplary execution of ſo many noble men and cittizens, whoſe names hee doth omit in ſilence.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, he ſayeth, that when the commotion began, hee was altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vnarmed and faſt a ſleepe in his houſe.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, that his great paines which hee tooke in contayning the people from murther, doth declare him that his intent was neuer to ſtir that Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to ſedition.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, the care which he had to ſaue them of his officers, who had not well deſerued of him, doth manifeſtly prooue that he neuer intended any thing agaynſt his ſeruantes.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all, the ſauing of the liues of his Swiſſers, Captaines, and Souldiers doth plainly ſhew, that hee neuer feared any thing ſo much as to diſpleaſe him.</p>
               <p>Theſe be the pennes where with he doth ſo vary his ſkill, and doth write ſo contrary thinges, not to delight (as the art of Rhetorike teacheth) but by the one to confeſſe the truth, with the other to colour his actions, diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and lye; and by the third to diuert the crime of thoſe things which haue happened from himſelfe and his partakers, and to charge the King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarre,</hi> and the Duke <hi>Eſpernon,</hi> namely, as the workers and practiſers of all the miſdemeanours that haue fallen out in that commotion.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, the King about the 17. of May being at <hi>Chartres,</hi> ſent letters vnto the gouernours of the prouinces of his Realme, to geue them notice according to the trueth of things which had happened at <hi>Paris.</hi> But namely hee wrote letters vnto the Lord <hi>Boiſeguine,</hi> gouernour for his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty in the citty of <hi>Poytiers,</hi> and knight of the order of the holy Ghoſt: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he ſheweth briefly the ſumme of the matter, of ſo ſudden (and contrary to his will) comming of the Duke of <hi>Guyze,</hi> of his owne intent in placing new gariſons within <hi>Paris,</hi> what had there hapened by the ſecret practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the Duke of <hi>Guyze,</hi> of the cauſes of his retire to <hi>Chartres,</hi> praying him to giue notice of all theſe thinges to the Lords, Gentlemen, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of credit in <hi>Poytow</hi> and thereabout.</p>
               <p>He writeth alſo to the ſame effect vnto the people and inhabitants of his realme for to diuert them from rebellion, to the which they might be ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited by the Duke of <hi>Guyze,</hi> and his partakers, and by the example of the Citty of <hi>Paris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="247" facs="tcp:8966:130"/>
Whileſt theſe things are ſo handled on both ſides, euery one iuſtifiyng his cauſe: The Leaguers ſeeing themſelues farther to execute their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent vpon the kings perſon than euer before; do ſeaze vpon as many towns <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1588. May"/> and holdes as they can: and about the 25. and 26. of May, the Cardinall and the Duke of <hi>Guyze</hi> went out of <hi>Paris,</hi> and ſeazed vpon <hi>Meaulx</hi> and <hi>Chaſteautiery</hi> in <hi>Brye.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The king ſeazed vpon <hi>Corbeil</hi> and <hi>Meloune,</hi> and other holdes and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces vpon the riuer of <hi>Seyne,</hi> right againſt <hi>Brie,</hi> and vpon the high wayes to <hi>Paris:</hi> but the Duke of <hi>Guize</hi> hauing made ſure <hi>Meaulx</hi> &amp; <hi>Chaſteautiery</hi> (as is ſaid) about the 27. of May returned to <hi>Paris,</hi> and conſidering how the holding of <hi>Corbiel</hi> and <hi>Meloune,</hi> was very grieuous to <hi>Paris;</hi> do in haſt prepare all things for the ſiege of <hi>Meloune,</hi> and doth his beſt indeuour to force it: but ſeeing that it was too hot for him, and that it would not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered being ſo ſtrongly fortified by the king, gaue it ouer.</p>
               <p>Whileſt theſe things aboue ſaid were a doing, there appeared within <hi>Paris</hi> ſpaniſh captaines, euery day more than other, &amp; out of diuers parts men did ioyne with them. Some (who were faythfull to the king and of ſome credit among the people) went through the ſtreetes to perſwade the inhabitance to open their ſhops, and to doe as they haue done before.</p>
               <p>Other who were of the league, did cry with a lowd voice, ſhut vp your ſhops, and take armes: if you will not, be ranſaked, your wiues rauiſhed, and loſe your traffick. Many of the inhabitants went foorth out of <hi>Paris,</hi> and retired ſome whither elſe: they who could not doo it, deſired greatly the Kings returne.</p>
               <p>In the meane time, that on euery ſide they make their parts ſtrong, and that the parties were like to come to handy blowes. The Leaguers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering their ſtrength to be weak, if the king ſhould take the matter at the worſt, ſent three manners of ſpials.

               <p>Secondly, the Capuchins were ſent thither in proceſſion, that vnder the colour of hypocriticall holynes, they might ſee what weather was at <hi>Chartres,</hi> and to try if the kings minde was any thing altred toward the Friery, Monkerie, and popiſh ſuperſtition, and inclining in any wiſe to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heretikes, as they tearmed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

               <p>The Queene my mother hath geuen me to vnderſtand, that you were all aſſembled and will repayre to me, whereof I am well pleaſed, being aſſured that you would not offend in ſuch force, being the firſt company of my Realme. I haue promiſed to my ſelfe of you alwayes all faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes and obedience, ſuch as you haue ſhewed heretofore to my prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors (Kings) as vnto your lawfull and naturall Princes: And I know that if it had beene in your power to let thinges there paſſed, that you woulde haue done it. I am ſory for that which hath happened to the city of <hi>Paris:</hi> notwithſtanding I am not the firſt to whome ſuch miſfortune hath happenned: And the more I am diſpleaſed, that the ſpare of theſe foureteene yeares that I haue beene king, I haue alwayes honoured it with my abode, ſhewing all gentlenes and goodnes to the inhabitants, and they haue alwayes found me a good king, gratifiyng them in all that euer I could: I know that in ſuch a Citie as that is there be good and bad: when they ſhall make their ſubmiſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; will acknowledge themſelues, I will be readie to receiue and imbrace them, as a good father his children, and as a good King his ſubiects. Your dutie is to labour in the matter, for therein conſiſteth the preſeruation of the Citie, of your ſelues, your wiues, and your familyes. Furthermore, continue in your charges as you haue accuſtomed: the Queene my mother ſhall certifie you from time to time of my will.</p>

                  </gap>uſe that euer ſuch a thing came in their mindes, I knowe that Gariſons are ſet either to vndoo a Citie, or for the miſtruſt of the inhabitants. They ought not to thinke that I would deſtroy a Citie, to the which I haue ſhewed ſo many tokens and witneſſe of my good will, which I haue ſo much benefited by my long abiding therein, for to haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned there more then ten of my predeceſſors before me had done: which thing hath brought to the inhabitantes, euen to the ſimpleſt ſort of artiffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, all the commodities which there doo appeare this day, whereby ten or twelue other Cities might haue been made rich. And when my officers
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:8966:131"/>
or Marchants haue had neede of me, I haue done them good: and I may ſay that I haue ſhewed my ſelfe a good King towards them. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1588. May"/> it was farre from me, to conceaue any diffidence of them, whome I haue ſo dearely loued, and of whome I ought to aſſure my ſelfe: for the friendſhip which I haue witneſſed vnto them, was enough to take away that opinion from them, that I ſhould bee willing to giue them Gariſons, neither can it (in trueth) bee ſaid, that any man of my gardes or Gariſons, hath put his foote in any houſe, or taken from any man a loafe of bread, or any thing elſe, but contrariwiſe haue at my prouiſion been furniſhed of all needful things: neither ſhould they haue ſtayed there aboue foure and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie houres, but the morrow after, without lying in any other place, ſhould haue been appointed to their charge, as if they had been in the campe. I intended to haue made exactly a ſearch of many ſtrangers, who were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in my Citie of <hi>Paris,</hi> and deſirous to offend no man: I ſent euen to the Lord of <hi>Guize,</hi> and other Lords, to that end they ſhould giue me a booke of the names of their houſhold ſeruants, and to cauſe the reſidue to auoyde. Whereof I was aduertiſed, that there was a great number, no leſſe then fifteene thouſand men, which thing I did for the preſeruation of the Citie, and ſafetie of my ſubiects. This is the cauſe that I will haue them to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge their fault, with ſorrow and diſpleaſure. I knowe well, that they are made beleeue, that hauing offended me in ſuch a ſort as they haue done, mine indignation is irreconſiliable. I will you to let them knowe, that I haue not that humor nor will to vndoo them: and that as God, as whoſe Image I am here vpon the earth (though vnworthie) deſireth not the death of a ſinner, ſo doo I not deſire their vndooing. I will alwaies prooue the peaceable way, and when they ſhall ſhew their duetie, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe their fault, and teſtifie in deede, the ſorrow which they haue of their offence, I will receaue, and imbrace them as my ſubiects, in ſhewing my ſelfe as a father toward his children. I will haue them to acknowledge me as their King and Maſter: if they doo it not, but delay the matter, in draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my hand, as I may doo, I will make them feele their offence, ſo that the marke thereof ſhall remaine for euer. For being the firſt and principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt Citie, honored with the firſt and ſuprem court of my Kingdome, and other courtes, priuiledges, honors, and vniuerſitie, I can (as you know) reuoake and remoue thence, all my courtes and vniuerſitie, which would turne to their great diſpleaſure: for theſe things ceaſing, all other commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities and traffick will diminiſh, as it fellout in the yeare 1579. during the great plague, by reaſon of my abſence, and ceaſing of the Parliament, a great number of my officers, being retyred thence, young Children were ſeene that yeare to play at the nine pinnes in the ſtreates. I knowe that there is a great number of good men in my Citie of <hi>Paris,</hi> and that of foure parts, three are of that number who are very ſory of that which hath hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened.
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:8966:132"/>
Let them therefore ſo deale, that I may be content, let them not inforce me to ſhew them what I may doo, more to doo that which I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and will not. You knowe that patiency prouoked, doo turne into fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1588.

And although I bee not of a vindicatiue ſpirit, yet I would that they ſhould know that I haue courage as much as any of my predeceſſors. I haue not yet, ſince the time that I came to the Crowne, by the death of my brother, vſed any rigour toward any man, yet will not I, that they ſhould abuſe my clemency; I am not an vſurper; I am a lawfull King by ſucceſſion, and of a race which hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies commaunded with clemencie. It is a tale to ſpeake of religion, they muſt take another way: there is not a Prince in this world, more Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke, which deſireth more the rooting out of hereſie then I; my actions and my life haue giuen ſufficient witnes in that behalfe to my people: I would that it had coſt me an arme, that the laſt heretick were in picture in this chamber. Goe home to your charges and bee of good courage, you ought not to feare any thing while you haue mee on your ſide, I will you to let them vnderſtand all that I haue tolde you.</p>
               <p>During theſe practiſes of the Leaguers, and their running to an fro, to amend their errour, to fortifie themſelues, to make a way to reconſiliation, they ſtoope to the <hi>Q Mother,</hi> who was left at the <hi>Loure,</hi> there they cap and crouch vnto her, they kiſſe her hands, and giue her ſugred words, excuſing the matter, that they meant no hurt, but were put in ſome feare by the kings forces, being lodged and placed in Gariſon before their doores, they were all the Kings moſt obedient and faithfull ſeruants, they require no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, but that a Catholick ſucceſſe be nominated, an immortall warre denounced againſt the hereticks: vpon that condition they are ready to bee ſacrificed at his feete, that ſhe would be a meane to pacifie his anger and diſpleaſure; ſhe had been hetherto the onely vpholder of the ſtate againſt the hereticks, now ſhe may ſhew a notable proofe of her great wiſdome, and do great ſeruice to the holy Church.</p>
               <p>By theſe and ſuch like perſwaſions, ſhe was eaſily wonne to bee a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator yet once for them to the King.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Q. Mother</hi> was as deeply fallen into the crime of treaſon as they, ſaue onely in one degree: for they had conſpired the kings death, and vſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of his kingdome. Shee was not deſirous of the kinges death, nor that his kingdome ſhould be taken from him, but ſhe was glad and ſought all meanes to keepe him wrapped in troubles during her life, though it ſhould coſt him at length his life and ſtate, that ſhee might alwayes wreſt the rule and gouernment out of his hand, by throwing him headlong from time to tyme into troubles and dangers.</p>
               <p>This accurſed woman therefore ſeeth here an occaſion proffered her to
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:8966:132"/>
nouriſh ſtill her ambitious humor, &amp; to bind both the king and his enemies vnto her by the meanes of reconciliation. She from tyme to time ſendeth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1588. May"/> vnto the king, maketh him beleeue that there is not ſo much fault in the Leaguers, as it outwardly ſeemeth to bee: they tooke armors to defend themſelues, ſtanding in ſome feare and miſtruſt of his forces diſpoſed in the ſtreetes at their dores, and that it was rather a fray which happened by the prouoking of ſome vnaduiſed perſons, then any intent of rebellion, and that the people once mooued ranne ſomewhat raſhly and inordinatly (as the maner is in ſuch a caſe) ſhee warneth him to take heede, not to kindle a new ciuill warre farre more dangerous then the former, with the here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes, ſtronger in forces, wealth, and partakers: &amp; if all the power of the realme had not béene able to extinguiſh the former, it would bee an endles worke to bring this to an end: which could not bee done without the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerting, or at leaſt the renting of the kingdome, that in tyme he may well be reuenged of the iniuries of ſome, of whom hee feeleth himſelfe greeued. It is beſt to diſſemble and winke for a time, then by a precipitation of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell to hazard life and ſtate. By this Cup, which ſhee borrowed of <hi>Circe</hi> her countrey woman, ſhe tranſformed the king from a man (hauing a Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons hart) into a ſheepe, caſt him in a ſound and vnſenſiblenes: whereby af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he could not feele the good counſels of his faithful ſubiects, who proffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him their help to reuenge ſuch notorious and publike contumelies, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till that at length neceſſity enforced him to do it.</p>
               <p>The rumor of ſuch a notable treaſon, attempted and performed by the Leaguers, in expelling the king of ſuch an ancient race out of his imperial Citty, ſpread abroad, there repayred vnto the king two maner of people, to offer him their help in the reuengement of ſuch an iniury, to wit, ſome Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guers, which (ſeeing that the Lorreins had proceeded ſo far as to attempt agaynſt his perſon and ſtate) now do change their minde, do pitty their Prince ſo much abuſed vnder colour of Catholiciſme. The Catholikes both noble, eccleſiaſticall and commons, the better &amp; ſounder part of them come in poſt to the King, exclaiming againſt the <hi>Guyzes,</hi> and againſt their preſumption, requiring the K. to take puniſhment equall to the greatnes of the offence, do counſell him to let alone the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> and all the heretikes, who neuer enterpriſed ſuch a thing, and to turne his forces a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt ſuch notorious offenders. They prayed him to ouergoe his greefe, they proffer him their ſeruice, their liues, goods, and meanes for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance thereof.</p>
               <p>The King deſpiſeth not their good counſell and affection toward him, but being bewitched by the ſorcering of his mother, as is aboueſaid, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth them quietly, that he wanted neither courage nor force to reuenge his priuat iniuries, ſayth, that he will not kindle a new ciuill warre in his realme, thanketh them, and ſendeth them home, intending already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiliation
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:8966:133"/>
with the Leaguers. It is ſayd before how the Leaguers and the Pariſiens leagued with them, perceauing that the miſſing of the King might turne to their ſhame and vndooing, tryed to iuſtify their actions by letters, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1588. May"/> ſolicited other townes and citties to the like rebellion, fortifyed themſelues, ſeazed vppon as many holdes as they could ſurprize: and in the meane time ſearched and viewed the Kinges mynd by their ſecret ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, ſounded his mind a farre of by the hipocriticall Capuchins, whether theſe vngratefull actions had any thing mooued him to diſoaine poperie, and to ſeeme to encline to them of the reformed religion: but ſpecially by them of the court of Parliament, whom they ſent to him to know his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to peace, and how he digeſted the contumelious iniuries.</p>
               <p>It is ſayd alſo, that in the meane time by the means of his mother, they extinguiſhed that Nemeſis, which is in great Princes, and turned it into puſillanimity: and how bee ſhewed ſome tokens of that baſenes of hart in his ſpeeches with them of his court of Parliament.</p>
               <p>Now the Leaguers perceiuing by all theſe meanes, that the Kinges heat was cooled, &amp; more inclined vnto impunitie, which he calleth clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, then vnto puniſhment and reuenge: Before they enter into treaty of peace, they goe about to temper him ſomewhat better yet, by a forme of petition: and to giue ſome authority to the ſame, they borrow both the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and the name of the Cardinall of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> whoſe authority from the beginning they had made a couering of their negotiation and conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</p>
               <p>This Cardinall being one of the firſt Princes of the blood, was not ignorant long time before, of all theſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>motions, &amp; of the old hatred which they of the houſe of <hi>Guyze</hi> haue borne to the Princes, friends, and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, of the houſe of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> and that in ſeeking the decay and fal of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they procured alſo his own: But through a certaine vnhappines, he had ſuffered himſelfe to be poſſeſſed and handled by them of the contrary part, and following their counſels, they had made alwaies a buckler of him, conſidering his qualitie and degree, which he hath in that realme, as well among the Princes, as among the prieſts. So that many of them to ſerue their turne did not feare, to affirme that he was the eldeſt of the houſe of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> and that if neede were, hee was capable of the ſucceſſion to the Crowne. This man therefore ſerued much to their faction: him they thruſt forward for the negotiation and aduauncing of their affayres, according to the occaſions.</p>
               <p>So that hauing determined to ſend a ſupplication to the King, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwage his diſpleaſure, while they aduiſe vpon other wayes, to entangle and entrap him yet once more. They prepoſe the ſaid Cardinall his name in the ſaid petition, that the greatnes of his name (onely of that faction of all the houſe of <hi>Bourbon)</hi> may ſerue as a vayle to the affections, of them
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:8966:133"/>
who were more watchfull in handling of their affaires, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſaid Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall was in the gouerning of his owne. They doo preſent this ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in the name of the Cardinall of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> and of the Maſters of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1588. May"/> League, who would faine becalled Princeſſe, and in the name of the Citie of <hi>Paris,</hi> and of the other Cities of their confederacie. In this ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they make a low courſie and al contemptious capping, with an humble ſubmiſſion and proteſtation of their good willes, with a proffer of their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, and of all that they haue, for the defence of his eſtate, and of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick religion, ſo that the Duke of <hi>Guize</hi> may haue the leading of his forces and managing of their affaires.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they charge the Duke <hi>Eſpernon</hi> and his brother, the Lord <hi>Valette,</hi> to be fauourers of the hereticks, to haue betrayed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kings forces, in hindering all good exploytes, to bee done againſt the hereticks, and the King of <hi>Nauarre.</hi> To haue fauored the armie of the Germanes in their retiring home, to haue beene the cauſe by his counſell of the vprore happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of late at <hi>Paris.</hi> To haue waſted the Kinges treaſure, to be the author of all the diſorde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> which is in the gouernement.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, they purge themſelues of any priuat inimitie, or affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him in this accuſation, and for proofe of the foreſaid offences, doo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre themſelues to the teſtimonie of the <hi>Queene Mother,</hi> and of the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of his Crowne, if it pleaſeth him to examine them vppon the ſaide crimes, and giue them licence to ſpeake their mindes with libertie.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, they demand of him inſtantly with prayer to put the ſayd <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernon</hi> and <hi>Valette</hi> his brother, and their adherents, from his perſon and fauour, and to diſcharge them from all charges and gouernements which they haue in the Realme, &amp; that the king will prouide them of ſome ſmall charges, of no importance at all. They alſo doe aſſure the King, that in ſo doing, he ſhall greatly pleaſe the people, in deliuering them as they ſay from that feare, which they haue conceaued of the power of the ſaid <hi>Eſpernon.</hi> Theſe lets being taken away, they require him to make warre in <hi>Guienne,</hi> in his owne perſon, to whome they doe promiſe their ready will, courage and aſſiſtance, againſt the heretikes, and in the meane time to appoynt his mother to gouerne <hi>Paris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fiftly, they require that the Duke <hi>de Maine</hi> may haue an armie to goe into <hi>Daulphine,</hi> againſt them of the Religion, they tell him that hee may make a great booty of the ſpoyle of <hi>Eſpernon</hi> &amp; his brother, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the warre, and that hee will aboliſh all new ſubſidies and charges layd vpon the people.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, they doe require that he will name a ſucceſſor Catholick, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it greatly to fall into the hands of them of the reformed Religion.</p>
               <p>Seuenthly, they of <hi>Paris</hi> (as partakers in this requeſt) doo faine and gloſe with the king, and pray him moſt humbly to beleeue them, that all
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:8966:134"/>
which had happened of late at <hi>Paris,</hi> was not that they thought to do him any harme, and that it was done by their Magiſtrates, and that onely they doubted leaſt the authors of the counſel (in bringing extraordinary forces <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1588. May"/> into the Citie) would haue abuſed his authoritie in oppreſſing them</p>
               <p>They fayne themſelues very ſory, that hee went foorth of their Citie in diſpleaſure and miſtruſt, praying him to giue them leaue to liue in reſt vnder his obedience.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all, they require that the Lord <hi>d'Ho</hi> be diſcharged hereafter, of his charge which he had to commaund in the Citie, and that he will allow the depoſing of the Prouoſt and Eſcheuins, and approue the new election which they haue made of others, and that hereafter it be lawfull for the Citizens to chooſe their owne officers.</p>
               <p>Alſo when it ſhall pleaſe him to returne into the Citie, hee will not bring within twelue leagues thereof, any other forces beſide his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary guards. This ſupplication was preſented to him the eight and twe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tith of May.</p>
               <p>The King hauing receiued this ſuplication, anſwereth it the nine and twentith of May at <hi>Chartres,</hi> wherein firſt hee rehearſeth the zeale which he hath to the Catholick religion, the great and dangerous warrs which he had done, the great charges which hee hath beene at for the ſame, the famous victories obtained by him againſt them of the reformed religion: and how he hath pacified the troubles rayſed by the Leaguers, and vnited the Catholicks, which were by the Leaguers deuided.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he ſheweth himſelfe willing to put vp all iniuries, paſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him in <hi>Paris,</hi> when the inhabitants ſhall behaue themſelues hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as it becommeth them to doe, and in ſo doing hee proffereth them to preſerue them in their liberties, as his predeceſſors haue doone before him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, hee wiſheth nothing more than that all the popiſh Princes, Lords, and ſubiects may be reunited againe to warre againſt the King of <hi>Nauarre.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, he greatly deſireth the reformation of his Realme in al his partes: and for becauſe it is a publike contagion, he ſuppoſeth that it can not be well done, without the aſſembly of the States, which he intendeth to aſſemble in the towne of <hi>Bloys</hi> the fifteeneth of Auguſt, where he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth to ſatiſfie them in warranting them from falling into the handes of the king of <hi>Nauarre</hi> or any other here<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ick. As touching the complaints againſt the Duke <hi>Eſpernon</hi> he promiſeth to them iuſtice therein.</p>
               <p>It is ſayd before, how the King after the retyre of the Germans retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to <hi>Paris,</hi> intending to make a voyage to <hi>Guienne</hi> agaynſt the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> with all his forces, and in his proper perſon had prepared the way to doo great exployts, by ſending forces vnto <hi>Lauerdine</hi> Lieutenant

of <hi>Niort,</hi> immediatly after the death of the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and how the ſayd Lord <hi>Lauerdine</hi> with thoſe forces ſeazed vpon the Iles of <hi>Marans,</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1588. May"/> and tooke all the Forts within the Iland. Which exployts being done, the Lord <hi>Cluſeaulx,</hi> otherwiſe called <hi>Blanchard,</hi> obtayned the gouernment of the ſayd Iland, where hee determined to ſettle himſelfe: and after many extorſions, ranſackings and robberies, done (during and after the ſiege of <hi>Marans)</hi> to them of the reformed religion, who had abandoned all things to ſaue themſelues at <hi>Rochel;</hi> he promiſed to himſelfe to fortifie and kéepe well the ſayd places, in hope ſhortly after to occupie the whole gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Aunis,</hi> and to plague the inhabitants of <hi>Rochel.</hi> Therefore he lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged there his regiment, which conſiſted of ten Enſignes, whom he deuided in the Forts of the Iland: and to make warre out right, he ordained the Lord <hi>Tremblay</hi> to bee in garriſon there with a companie of fourtie light horſes.</p>
               <p>He cauſed great ſtore of white Corſlets and newe Pikes to be brought thether out of <hi>Paris,</hi> to arme his garriſons there. He ſendeth Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to the Pariſhes round about, euen to them which lye next to <hi>Rochel,</hi> to haue a number of Pyoners, to gather Subſidies and Tallages, and to bring them to <hi>Marans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He prepared a number of Barkes and boates for to hold the Sea, and to ſeaze vppon the Ile of <hi>Rhe,</hi> by the intelligences which he had with the Lord S. <hi>Luke</hi> of <hi>Browage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He cauſed the Corne and Wine to be taken vp through the Farmes of the gouernment of <hi>Rochel,</hi> and tooke many priſoners. To be ſhort, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very bigge, he omitted no poynt of hoſtilitie, hoping to make there a ſecond <hi>Browage,</hi> and a Blockhouſe to famiſh <hi>Rochel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> did beare with him: and hauing ſpied his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, during the ſpace of two moneths and a halfe, the ſayd King hauing on a ſudden aſſembled certaine companies of footmen and horſemen, &amp; made all things readie, the 24. of Iune entered the Iland at <hi>Charron</hi> nigh to <hi>Marans</hi> ouer the bridges, which he had cauſed to bee made in diuers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. In this Iland were holden by the enemie the Forts of <hi>Charron</hi> and <hi>Brault,</hi> wherein were foure ſcore Souldiers harquebuſiers, commaunded by Captaine <hi>Chautery,</hi> hee beſieged the Fort of <hi>Brault,</hi> as the néereſt of greater importance and more defendable by the enemie, whoſe loſſe drew after it the loſſe of <hi>Charron.</hi> He drewe by the channell of <hi>Seure</hi> two ſhippes ſet in readines to batter it: but at night it was ſurrendered, their liues ſafe: notwithſtanding, of courteſie he granted both to the Captaine and Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers their ſwords: &amp; immediatly they of <hi>Charron</hi> ſurrendered themſelues likewiſe, being in number twentie of the beſt Souldiers of the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>The 25. day he cauſed a bridge to be made vpon the channell of <hi>Brune,</hi>
                  <pb n="256" facs="tcp:8966:135"/>
approaching ſtill to the Ile of <hi>Marans,</hi> and went himſelfe to view the fort <hi>Clouzie,</hi> and a certaine houſe fortified by the enemie, called the houſe of <hi>Clouzie,</hi> nigh the méetings of two channels which doo waſh the ſayd houſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1588.

Theſe two Forts doo lye vpon a deepe channell, which they muſt needes paſſe ouer to enter into <hi>Marans,</hi> diſtant one from the other a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſixe ſcore paces, and beyond the ſayd channell betweene the two forts a newe fort was builded, for to let the caſting of the bridge, if any ſhould be made. This newe fort was in the ſight of the two forts, to wit, the fort of <hi>Clouzie,</hi> and the houſe of <hi>Clouzie,</hi> whereof is ſpoken of before.</p>
               <p>All things well viewed, the ſayd King concluded to attempt vpon theſe fortes: the reſt of the day paſſed away in ſhooting certaine volleys of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance vppon thoſe fortes out of the ſhippes, and in certaine light ſkirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes. In the euening the ſayd King cauſed the ſhippes to goe downe the water to the Iland <hi>Charron,</hi> to take from the enemy the ſuſpicion of the thing which hee determined to do the day following.</p>
               <p>The 26. day being the Lords day, about three a clock, hee came with few of his men before <hi>Clouzie,</hi> made his bridges ſure, aduauncing forward, his Gabions prepared the bridge to bee caſt betweene the two forts, ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the places where they might enter into <hi>Marans,</hi> cauſeth his ſhippes to approach into that place, where they were the day before, putting his regimentes in battaile aray, placing them in the ſame order that they ſhould march, and alſo his footmen to ſuſtayne the enemy at the entring of the Iland, and to ſerue for ſuch occaſions as might ryſe, he being himſelfe in perſon the formoſt to ſee with the eie what ſhould be needeful to be done. The morning paſſed away in ſuch exerciſes, and in the meane while the enemy did what he could to keepe him off.</p>
               <p>At 11. a clock, prayers and ſinging of Pſalmes vnto God being ended throughout all his regimentes and troupes of horſemen, after hee had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted euery man what they ſhould doo, hee began to force the paſſage, kept by a companie of the regiment of the Lord <hi>Cluſeaulx,</hi> and with the company of light horſes of the Lord <hi>Tremblay,</hi> flanked on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one ſide with the fort <hi>Clouzie,</hi> and on the other ſide by the houſe <hi>Clouſie,</hi> which was (as is aforeſayd) fortified and in front defended by the third fort, and a trench in the middle.</p>
               <p>Vpon the right hand of the houſe of <hi>Clouſy</hi> marched the maſter of the Campe <hi>Preaulx,</hi> who had ſlyded with his troupes into the reedes, to paſſe ouer the channell in a place knowen, and yet not without danger and the Captayne <hi>Ferrand</hi> with him: hee tooke alſo with him the Captaines <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meau</hi> and <hi>Nede</hi> into the ſame reedes.</p>
               <p>A little behind was the Baron <hi>Salignak</hi> with his regiment to geue the ſcalado to the ſayd houſe.</p>
               <p>Right againſt the houſe of <hi>Clouzie,</hi> foure captaines with their Souldiers
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:8966:135"/>
thoſen out of the regiment of the Lord <hi>Granuile,</hi> did aduaunce the Gabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons vppon the banke of the channell, and behind their Gabions were in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1588.

               </p>
               <p>At the lift hand going toward <hi>Clouſy</hi> (to occupy the enemy) all along the channell marched the new and old gardes of the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> conduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Captaynes <hi>Porte</hi> and <hi>Vignoles,</hi> and the Harquebuziers on horſeback of the Lord <hi>Peujas,</hi> who were al lighted of their horſe with Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Limalle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The horſemen were behind the footmen, the troupe of the Lord <hi>Peu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jas</hi> behind the regiment of the Lord <hi>Granuile,</hi> and the companies of <hi>Rhe,</hi> which followed the bridge.</p>
               <p>The mayne forces of the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> commaunded by the Prince of <hi>Soiſſons,</hi> were a hundred paces and more behind, but a litle more aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced vppon the lift hand.</p>
               <p>The enemyes ſeeing the Kinges forces in that aray, and that they had bowed theyr knees on the ground to make their prayers to God afore they went to the battell, and calling to remembrance the prayers which were made at <hi>Coutras,</hi> did fall into ſuch a feare, as they began to crye, they pray, they will beat vs as they did at <hi>Coutras:</hi> and beginning to wauer, on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den fled away in great diſorder.</p>
               <p>Here is to be noted, that had it not béen for the fault committed through haſtines in caſting the bridge in a place where the chanell was forked, whereas it ſhould haue béene caſt below the méeting of two channels, they had béen followed with ſuch violence, that they had béen cut to peeces afore they could haue come to <hi>Marans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is not to bee forgotten, that the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> at the ſame houre cauſed the regiments of his gardes of <hi>Charbonieres,</hi> and <hi>Soubran,</hi> conduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Lord <hi>Mignonuile,</hi> Marſhall of the campe, to take paines for to wade ouerthwart the Mariſhes in the water to the knee, more then a League, and defeated a part of the enemie, whome they met in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyring.</p>
               <p>The Fort of <hi>Clouſy,</hi> ſeeing the diſaray of their fellowes, rendered imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly: at diſcretion therein were foureſcore men commaunded by Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Serre,</hi> who were all ſaued; the enemies partly made their retire in great haſte to <hi>Marans,</hi> and partly fled another way.</p>
               <p>In the towne where it was thought that ſome reſiſtance would haue
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:8966:136"/>
been made, was ſuch a maze, that there was found no body.</p>
               <p>Many of the forces of the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> not ſtaying for the ſetting on of the bridge, both a foote and horſeback, caſt themſelues in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1588. Iune"/>
               </p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Cluſeaulx,</hi> who did dine at <hi>Marans</hi> whileſt the King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarre</hi> did force the paſſage, hearing of the flight of his men, as well with them which had remained within the towne, as with them who had retired from the garde of the paſſage, with the Lord <hi>Tremblay,</hi> few of the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fled into the Caſtell, becauſe there was no other way nor place to flee to.</p>
               <p>The firſt which entred into <hi>Marans</hi> were the gardes of the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> followed at hand with the reſt of the armie, as faſt as they could paſſe ouer at <hi>Clouſy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At the ſame inſtant, the enemies were beſieged in the Caſtell, the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters parted to euerie regiment, and at euening euerie one was lodged vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Caſtell ditch. The King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> followed them at hand with his maine forces, and lodged that ſame night at <hi>Marans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſame day were ſummoned all theſe forts following, fortified with Gariſons of the enemie. The Fort <hi>Boyſneuf,</hi> where commaunded the Lieutenant of Captaine <hi>Serre,</hi> with thirtie men with him, who yeelded. Alſo the Fort <hi>Brune,</hi> wherein were threeſcore men, commaunded by Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Camart,</hi> who yeelded alſo: The Fort <hi>Allowette,</hi> holden with twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie men, commaunded by the Lieutenant of Captaine <hi>Roque,</hi> all yeelded with their liues ſafe. There reſted in all the Iland that day, being the ſixe and twentie of Iune, to recouer from the hand of the enemie, but the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtell, the Forts <hi>Bastile</hi> and <hi>Paulee,</hi> ſituated vpon the other entries into the Iland. The prudence of the K. of <hi>Nauarre</hi> is not to be forgotten, that before he aſſaulted the Iland, hee placed the Lord <hi>Trimouille,</hi> with all his light horſemen, and the companies of the Lord <hi>Orges, Plaſſak,</hi> and <hi>Aram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bure,</hi> within the town of Saint <hi>Ihan</hi> of <hi>Liuerſay,</hi> in the high way from <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ort,</hi> to <hi>Marans,</hi> that the enemie might not receaue ſuccour through the <hi>Bastile.</hi> The Lord <hi>Trimouille</hi> had made a Fort in two dayes, betweene Saint <hi>Ihan</hi> of <hi>Liuerſay</hi> and <hi>Bastile,</hi> to cut from them which were therein, all meanes to eſcape away, and hope of ſuccour.</p>
               <p>The monday on the ſeauen and twentie of Iune, the Captaine and Souldiours of the ſaid <hi>Bastile,</hi> ſéeing that all the meanes to auoyde, were cut off from them, did yéeld, and went foorth with like conditions as their fellowes had done the day before, being in number foureſcore and ten, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded by Captaine <hi>Chapel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The eight and twenty, the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> with two canons, and two Culuerines, began to approach, and in the middeſt of the day, put them in place of batterie. The Lorde <hi>Clermont</hi> there did commaund: that night
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:8966:136"/>
there were certaine motions of Parley.</p>
               <p>The nine and twentie, about three a clock in the morning, when the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged ſaw that the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> went to worke in good earneſt, they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1588. Iune"/> demaunded to Parley, and in the name of all the reſt, came forth Captaine <hi>Riuiere,</hi> to require conditions of the King of <hi>Nauarre.</hi> At length the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition was concluded, that the Captaines and Gentlemen ſhould goe forth with their horſes and corſelets, &amp; the ſouldiours with their ſwords, that the reſt of their armour ſhould remaine within the Caſtell. The ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the campe, the Lord <hi>Tremblay,</hi> the Captaines <hi>Maron</hi> and <hi>Toure</hi> ſhould remaine in the hands of the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> to deliuer him the colours, to wit, eyght Enſignes (for two companies had none) and the Cornet.</p>
               <p>The agréement was carefully kept, the King himſelfe conducted them part of the way, they were not iniuried ſo much as one word, although the Lord <hi>Cluſeaulx</hi> had great enemies.</p>
               <p>The ſame day, Captaine <hi>Roque</hi> rendered the Fort <hi>Paulee,</hi> with the ſame conditions, that the Caſtell was yeelded vp: the Lord <hi>Lauerdine</hi> ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding word that he could not reſcue them, for becauſe the Lord <hi>Boulay</hi> was lodged on that ſide.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> kept <hi>Cluſeaulx</hi> priſoner, who was brought with great ſolemnitie into <hi>Rochel,</hi> where he was kept priſoner a long time, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing liſence (notwithſtanding) to goe where he would, vnder cuſtodie of certaine Souldiours: he was better vſed then many did expect: at length he was deliuered, and among other, vpon this condition, neuer more to ioyne himſelfe to the League.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> alſo ſendeth all the armour which there was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, in great ſtoare, with the colours to <hi>Rochel</hi> there were taken alſo: ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny faire horſes.</p>
               <p>So in the ſpace of foure dayes, he recouered all the Iles and Forts of <hi>Maran,</hi> &amp; did rid all that quarter of the filthie ſinke of the Leaguers, where he did ſhew no leſſe courteſie to his enemies, then valour and diligence in the repreſſing of them.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid before, how that after the accurſed and execrable rebellion, and inſolencie of the Leaguers in <hi>Paris,</hi> they perceauing the foule and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous errour which they had committed, in miſſing of the Kings perſon, and that hee was now ſafe enough from falling into their hands againe, which might redound to their vtter vndooing, they ſent three manner of ſpyalls to him, to view his countenance, to ſound the thoughts of his heart, by the way of ſorrowing and excuſing the deſperat fact attempted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his ſacred perſon in <hi>Paris.</hi> It is ſaide alſo, how they ſent a ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation vnto him, therein faining a ſubmiſſion full of ſnares, and vnreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble demaundes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="260" facs="tcp:8966:137"/>
It is ſayd alſo, how vppon the rumor ſpread abroad throughout all the realme, his faithfull ſeruantes of all callinges and degrees moued with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1588. Iune"/> and compaſſion repayred vnto him, moſt humbly prayed him not to put vp ſuch publike iniury, proffered him their ſeruice, goods, and liues for the reuengement of ſuch an outragious offence.</p>
               <p>Now agayne many of the Kinges ſubiects of all qualityes and degrées do repaire a freſh vnto the King, moſt inſtantly to require him not to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer ſuch a damnable treaſon of the <hi>Guyzes</hi> and their confederats let go vnpuniſhed, but that puniſhment be executed vpon ſuch offenders in ſuch ſort as is fit for the greeuouſnes of the offence: they do promiſe him againe all aide and ſuccour, if hee will reſolue himſelfe to ſeeke the meanes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge, and let the heretikes alone for a time.</p>
               <p>The King whom Gods iuſtice did vrge and purſue for the hardnes of his hart, in ſo obſtinating himſelfe againſt the Goſpell and other offences, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Iulie"/> which do iſſue out of that ſpring, ſeemed to be touched with the readines of his good Subiectes, but not to any purpoſe moued to follow their good counſell, but thanketh euery one as though hee had no neede at all of their counſell and ayde.</p>
               <p>The Leaguers now vnderſtanding by their ſpials the puſillanimity of the King, and his inclination to ſome compoſition and peace with them, though diſaduantagious, by his ſlender and fearfull anſwere to their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable demaunds in their ſupplication, do now conceaue a good hope, not onely to amend the former fault, but alſo to make themſelues a way more plaine and eaſier then euer they had before, to performe ſhortly their enterpriſes. And as they haue had recourſe alwaies to the <hi>Q. Mother,</hi> by whoſe meanes they haue found a preſent remedy in all faultes committed, and offences geuen to the King: but now y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> at their requeſt ſhe had beſotted him by her ſorceries, ſhee muſt make an end of her good worke begunne. This accurſed woman hath béen the diſhonor of womankinde, the ſubuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the whole kingdome, the ſlaughter of the nobility, the butcher of the commons, and the vndooing of her owne children.</p>
               <p>The Leaguers then hauing ſuch an interceſſor, who vnder colour of a motherly counſell, will bring them neerer to execute their rage vppon the Kinges perſon, and to vſurpe his eſtate, do ſend this old <hi>Medea</hi> to make a negotiation for them, as much to their aduantage as ſhee can. Therefore that they may ſtrip the King cleane out of authority, they do thruſt in their demaundes, the articles concluded at <hi>Nancy</hi> ſpoken of before. She muſt vrge the Kinges conſent to theſe articles following: for which intent ſhee went to <hi>Nemours,</hi> a towne in <hi>Gastinois.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In theſe demaunds they woulde faine make the Kinge beleeue, howe all that they doo is for the preſeruation of the popiſh religion, and that they deſyre greatly a reunion of the Catholiks, whereof he ſhould be the head.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="261" facs="tcp:8966:137"/>
Firſt, they doe demaund that all generally ſhall promiſe and ſweare, to imploy their perſons, goods, and meanes, for the conſeruation and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1588.

               <p>They ſhall ſweare alſo the rooting out of hereſie, and doe require pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion to be taken, that no heretike Prince, or ſuſpected of hereſie, or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourer of heretikes, may enioy the Crowne, whatſoeuer right he may pretend thereunto: and that this may be confirmed by an oath of all men. Alſo that the king ſhall ſweare to defend the Leaguers (who doo call themſelues Princes) againſt the heretikes and their fauourers.</p>
               <p>By this artcile they will exclude (if they may) all the Princes of the houſe of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> whome they will eaſily finde either heretikes, or fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers <note place="margin">

               <p>Secondly, they demaund, that it may pleaſe him to ſweare to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation of thoſe demaunds, and that hee will permit in their cuſtodie the townes and Cities which are graunted them, during ſix yeares: and that in all other townes which ſhall ioyne themſelues to the Leaguers, nothing be innouated, and that they may not be puniſhed for any offence or rebellion committed.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, they doe demaund that if during the ſix yeares, there ſhould happen any vocation of gouernours and Captaines, in the ſaide townes and Cities, that then the Leaguers may name ſuch as they think good, and that the king ſhall ſtabliſh ſuch at their requeſt.</p>
               <p>This is to diſpoſſeſſe the king of his holds, towns and cities, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to place ſuch as ſhall bee at their deuotion, whome they may truſt. <note place="margin">

               <p>Thirdly, they doe require the publiſhing of the councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> and the obſeruing of the ſame, and that the King ſhall forſake his aliance which he hath with princes and nations, heretickes, and that hee ſhall giue ouer the protection of certaine townes knowen to bee the receptacle of heretikes.</p>
               <p>By theſe they meane, the Germanes, the kings of <hi>Denmarke</hi> and <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The king knew very wel (except he had been <hi>talpacoecior)</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> theſe articles
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:8966:138"/>

               <p>As for the nomination of gouernours and captains in the ſayd townes, which they would haue to be reformed to them, to place therein ſuch as they would think good; he vnderſtoode well, that in plaine tearmes they meant to abridg y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſmall ſtore of authoritie which they had left him, and to make him their inferiour: He ſaw well enough, that the degraduatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and diſheriting of the lawfull Princes from the ſucceſſion of the crowne, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the colour of hereſie, or fauouring of heretikes, was but a meane to put the Crowne vpon their owne heads.</p>

vrging him with earneſt prayers to ſeeke the remedying and reuenge of theſe iniuries: why did he not hearken vnto them, and purſued them with ſtrong hand, if they had refuſed to anſwer to his iuſtice; which thing to doo <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1588.

The king therefore hoping to beſtowe a S. <hi>Bartholmews</hi> breakfaſt vpon them, was content to take any thing at their hands. This agréement concluded, cauſed an excéeding great ioy to all the conſpirators, who thought it to bée no ſmall cunning of theirs thus eaſily to haue auoided the deſerued puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their mutinie and rebellion: for which cauſe they of their confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racie doo carrie their heads higher then euer they did, their courage dooth double, and heate kindle againſt them of the reformed religion without compariſon farre more then before.</p>
               <p>Thereupon two mightie Armies are appoynted to be ſent, the one into <hi>Guienne,</hi> the other into <hi>Daulphine,</hi> compounded of the Kings &amp; Leaguers forces, dreadfull and terrible not only to the reformed Churches of <hi>France,</hi> but alſo to the Nations round about.

The Townes and Cities great and ſmall, according to the edict of reunion, doo ſhewe themſelues readie and willing to beſtow gold, ſiluer, goods, fauours, armours and liues to further the affaires of the Leaguers.

For this nauall Armie builded in <hi>Spayne,</hi> was thought ſufficient to conquer many Realmes: the ſhippes were of incomparable bignes, in number ſo many that they couered the ſeas. The moſt excellent Carpenters, cunning men, and fineſt workemen of all Europe, had ſpent their wits and ſeuen or eight yeares in the building and preparing of the ſayd Armie: The Artillerie,

               <p>As for <hi>France,</hi> the Spanyard made his account, to bee alreadie vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed and ſubdued vnder his power, hauing already theſe mightie armies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue ſaid, and the conſpiracie of the League on his ſide.

               </p>
               <p>On the other ſide, the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> had a mighty army in the Lowe Countrey, wherewith at the ſame time, to inuade the Countreys of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Zeland,</hi> and others where they haue the exerciſe of the reformed religion, ſo that they had alreadie ſwallowed in one morſell, by imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all <hi>France, England, Scotland, Zeland,</hi> and <hi>Holand:</hi> and for to make this great morſell goe downe eaſilie without choaking, there was in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of <hi>France</hi> two armies, and about <hi>France</hi> the Duke of <hi>Sauoy</hi> on the South, the Nauall army of <hi>Spayne</hi> on the Weſt, and <hi>Parma</hi> on the North ſide.</p>
               <p>The enemies of God made their full account, that there was no more hope to outſtand or ouerwaigh ſuch heauie forces.

               <p>The feare of theſe thunderclaps was great euery where, the forces in number and furniture were inequall: therefore in <hi>France,</hi> many not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that God may defend his people, as well with few as with many, and that hée hath Legions of Angels to fight at his commaundement, for the defence of his Elect, yéelded to the time, and reuolted, made their abiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and followed the world.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Guize</hi> was the Northen Star, by the which, all this Nauigation was guided, ſo that it was perceaued, that neither all this preparation and ſtoare, neither the Propheſies and viſions of the rauing Prophets, could aſſure the happy ſucceſſe, except the Duke of <hi>Guize</hi> might be in court, nigh the Kings elbow.

And whereas in the requeſt preſented to the King, it was demaunded that he ſhould be the Kings Generall of that armie, which ſhould bee ſent into <hi>Guienne.</hi> Now he dooth recant, and vpon the puſh doth refuſe to take <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1588.

               <p>In his roome therefore the Duke of <hi>Neuers</hi> is appoynted to conduct the armie into <hi>Guienne</hi> againſt the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> he maketh his excuſe (fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the whip as the other did) of his indiſpoſition, and offereth to maine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine one hundred Gentlemen, ſo that he might be excuſed, which charge, notwithſtanding at length he accepted.</p>
               <p>The wiſeſt ſort feared in general, that this wound could not be cloſed vp and healed, without ſome fowle ſcarre remayning, or that hee who had once preſumed to beat his Prince out of his imperiall citty, ſhould not want audacity to attempt further matters.</p>
               <p>All theſe vprores being now pacifyed, and all theſe great preparations vrged with great courage, they of the reformed religion all ready proſcript, all things threatning death and deſolation by land and by water, a parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the States is appointed by the King to be holden at <hi>Bloys</hi> the 15. day of Auguſt next following, there to determine vpon the affaires of the land according to the ſaid edict of reunion, and not otherwiſe, and about the reformation of the State: but ſpecially for the diſheneriting of the Princes of the bloud, that they ſhould not ſucceede to the Crowne. In this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament the King and the Duke of <hi>Guyze</hi> had diuers and contrary mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, and neither of them both did intend to do the thinges aboue ſayde, touching the affaires of the land, and reformation of the State.</p>
               <p>But the Kings purpoſe was, that now (hauing recouered as he thought part of his authority) hee might bridle his domeſticall enemy, to wit, the Duke of <hi>Guyze,</hi> whoſe practiſes and attempts had béen ſo euidently ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the eie of all men, agaynſt his perſon and eſtate, and there either to haue had him condemned and executed by the full aſſembly of the ſtates, or elſe by ſurpriſing to haue diſpatched him out of the way, as hee at length performed.</p>
               <p>The Dukes meaning was, either to exclude the King from all go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, or elſe to haue condemned him by the authority of all the ſtates, or if opportunity might ſerue, to do him away by ſome violence, and after to haue tryed how to bring his intent to paſſe.</p>
               <p>Euery one of them therfore hauing his contrary thoughts in his mind, yet they in common do prepare all things for this aſſembly of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:8966:140"/>
they make the ouerthrow of the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> and the raſing of the Blockhouſe of <hi>Rochel</hi> (as they tearme it) very eaſy. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1588. Iulie"/>

               <p>While they keepe this great adoo, and repleniſh the world with cruell threatnings, and are in hand both by land and by water, to aduance the treaſons of the Leaguers, which cannot be done without the rooting out of the true Religion. Therefore it is aſſaulted on the South ſyde by the Dukes of <hi>Sauoy</hi> and <hi>Mayne,</hi> with two mighty armies on the Weſt, by the omnipotent Armado; on the North, by all the forces of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> low Countryes; in the middle of <hi>France,</hi> by the Duke of <hi>Neuers</hi> with a mighty army: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, God who holdeth the ſtearne of the whole world doth produce euents all contrary vnto thoſe which men had promiſed to themſelues.</p>
               <p>For in the meane time God doth execute his dreadfull iudgements a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the inuincible (as they did call them) but in deed barbarous and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uage nation of Spaniards, partly beating them out of the narrow Seas with a notable ſlaughter and ſhame of them, by that nation which they had ſo deadly hated for the Goſpell, and ſo arrogantly deſpiſed: and partly God ſent his meſſengers, the wind, ſtorme and tempeſt, with the rocks in their waies, that by ſhipwracke, thirſt, famin, and peſtilence, and other calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Sea, they might be drowned in an euerlaſting obliuion, lyke <hi>Pharao,</hi> his horſes and horſemen.</p>
               <p>In Auguſt the Kings writtes are ſent into all prouinces and citties to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Auguſt"/> ſend ſpeedily their Deputies, ſo that they were catholikes, Romans, and not otherwiſe, and in the meane time doth fortify himſelf: but not miſtruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the practiſes of the Leaguers in the Prouinces, he gaue them leaue to do all by partialities in the Prouinces in choiſe of the Deputies. For they gaue order that their partakers might come ſtrong, not ſo much with the outward force, as with plurality of ſuffrages, which in all places they had ſecretly ſuborued by premiſes and corruptions. And ſo it came to paſſe, that there came but few to that aſſembly, but they which were of the Leaguers faction.</p>
               <p>Here (Chriſtian Reader) wee may ſee Gods iudgements, calling this great King as it were by ſteps, to a miſerable and ſhameful fall for his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulnes.

               <p>It is ſaid before how the Lord <hi>Colombieres</hi> had brought certaine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies out of <hi>Normandy</hi> vnto the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> and in Iune before had ſeazed vpon the towne of <hi>Montagne.</hi> This was a towne belonging to the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> which had beene miſerablie defaced in the former ciuill warres.

               <p>The Duke <hi>Mercure</hi> being lodged at <hi>Cliſſon,</hi> the tenth day of Auguſt vnderſtoode that the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> was gone foorth out of <hi>Rochel,</hi> and vpon the ſhadow of his owne feare he perſwaded himſelf that it is to raiſe vp the ſiege of <hi>Montagne;</hi> ſo that hauing repreſented vnto himſelfe the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed diligence of the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> in his exployts of warre, he i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magineth to ſee him alreadie: whereupon he determined to retyre before he had planted his ſiege, and returned to <hi>Nantes</hi> the 11. of Auguſt, two daies before the comming of the King of <hi>Nauarre:</hi> he left the regiment of <hi>Gerſay</hi> to make the retyre, and lodged the 12. day at <hi>Mounieres,</hi> a towne ſituated vpon the riuer <hi>Seure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> at his departure from <hi>Luſſon,</hi> went to lodge at <hi>Bourneueau,</hi> where the Lord <hi>Boulay</hi> with his companie of armed men well appoynted, and a companie of harquebuſiers on horſeback, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Captaine <hi>Nede</hi> ioyned to him.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Bourneueau</hi> the King went to lodge at <hi>Eſſars,</hi> where he was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſed that the Duke <hi>Mercure</hi> was departed and retyred to <hi>Nantes,</hi> and that the regiment of <hi>Gerſay</hi> was lodged at <hi>Mounieres.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe newes did cauſe him to diſlodge the day following very earely, leaſt he ſhould loſe the occaſion to ouertake that regime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: he went through the Towne of <hi>Montagne</hi> with much toyle, and there tooke the garriſon commanded by <hi>Luzerne</hi> eldeſt ſonne to the Lord <hi>Colombieres,</hi> and with extreame diligence in a little ſpace of time came to the riuer <hi>Seure,</hi> which he paſſed ouer ſpeedily on foord: there he found that the regiment was parted from <hi>Mounieres,</hi> purpoſing to retyre to <hi>Pilmil</hi> Suburbe of <hi>Nantes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The garriſon of <hi>Montagne</hi> being forerunners to the ſayd King, follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed with diligence, and ouertooke them in a way hollowe and couered, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry aduantagious for the enemie, by reaſon of three little houſes wherein they had put men to flancke them.

               <p>The King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> tooke to mercie as many as were taken priſoners to the number of foure hundred and fiftie, and ſuffered none to be killed but

There were eight Enſignes taken, great number of carts &amp; hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of carriage: the onſet was giuen within two leagues of <hi>Pilmil</hi> ſuburbe of <hi>Nantes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King (after giuing of thankes vpon that place where the ſkirmiſh was fought, for that proſperous ſucceſſe and victorie) made a light dinner vnder a tree, and after retyred to his lodging at S. <hi>Georges,</hi> where hee ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iourned the whole day following, for the long daies iourney which he had made the day before: notwithſtanding, that day hee went a hawking for Partridges, and in the euening viewed the towne of <hi>Montagne,</hi> to take order for the fortifications and garriſons of the ſayd towne, and purpoſed to haue layed the ſiege to the towne <hi>Cliſſon</hi> not farre thence.</p>
               <p>The King being yet at S. <hi>George,</hi> was ſtrengthened with foure regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of footmen, to wit, of <hi>Charbonieres, Sallignak, Preau,</hi> and the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his gardes, commanded by the Lord <hi>Querine:</hi> there alſo he recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the light horſemen of the Lord <hi>Trimouille,</hi> who had diſcomfited the regiment of <hi>Leſtele,</hi> and taken foure Enſignes, which they preſented vnto the ſayd King.</p>
               <p>The ſelfe ſame day being aduertized of the daunger wherein the Duke <hi>Eſpernon</hi> ſtood within the Towne of <hi>Engoleſme,</hi> beſieged there within the Caſtell by a conſpiracie of the Leaguers, cauſed him to giue ouer his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe vpon <hi>Cliſson,</hi> &amp; the day following being the 15. of Auguſt, departed from Saint <hi>George,</hi> purpoſing to make toward <hi>Engoleſme,</hi> to ſuccor the ſaide Lorde <hi>Eſpernon:</hi> but hearing by the way, how the tumult there was pacified, went not ſo far as that place.</p>
               <p>It is ſaide before, how that the Leaguers in their requeſt preſented vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the King, made a great complaint againſt the Duke <hi>Eſpernon,</hi> char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging him to haue intelligences with the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> and them of the religion, to haue been the cauſe that their armies had heretofore ſmall ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, and that if he ſhould grow to greater authoritie, it were danger that in time he would deliuer the places of his gouernement to the King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarre;</hi> that he is the onely cauſe, that the politick ſtate is ſo corrupt, and out of frame, and therefore the King muſt needes put him from about his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and fauour.</p>
               <p>This Lord <hi>Eſpernon</hi> of the auncient houſe of <hi>Valette,</hi> grew in great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour with the King, through his faithfull ſeruice, a man altogether ſold to popery, yet a louer of the Kings perſon, crowne and ſtate, a louer of the realme and peace of the ſame, a hater of conſpirators and perturbers of the quietnes of the King and his ſubiects, who neuer could bee drawne to the conſpiracies of the Leaguers, neither by faire promiſes nor other meanes whatſoeuer, which thing was the cauſe that the Leaguers hated him, as
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:8966:142"/>
the onely man about the Kings perſon, who did hinder the execution <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The King to giue place to their hatred for a time, and to auoyde the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conueniences, which through y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> malice of his enemies, might befall to ſuch a truſtie ſeruant, determined to ſend him out of their ſight, and where hee thought that they ſhould be leaſt able to practiſe againſt him. And giuing him a very great power and commiſſion in a moſt ample manner, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund in the Prouinces of <hi>Aniou, Toureyne, Poytow, Engomoyes,</hi> &amp; <hi>Xainc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonge,</hi> commaunded him to depart the Court, about the ſame time that the edict of reunion was made by the Leaguers: who hauing ſoiourned a while in the Tower of <hi>Loches,</hi> ſituated in <hi>Toureyne,</hi> vpon the riuer <hi>Vndre,</hi> which falleth into <hi>Loyre,</hi> betwéene <hi>Tours</hi> and <hi>Samure,</hi> to fortifie and aſſure the ſaid place to the Kings obedience, againſt the practiſes of certaine Gentlemen of the League, made againſt that place. From thence he tooke his iourney to <hi>Engoleſme;</hi> where he vnderſtoode that many enterpriſes were a working by the League againſt the Kings ſeruice. There commaunded the Lorde <hi>Tageus</hi> his kinſeman, vnder the charge of the Lord <hi>Valette</hi> his brother.</p>
               <p>The ſaide Lorde <hi>Eſpernon</hi> arriuing at <hi>Engoleſme,</hi> accompanied with a great number of the nobilitie, was honorably receaued by the Maior and Aldermen of the Citie, by the officers of iuſtice &amp; policie, with great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of people, who went to meete him at the gates of the Citie; hee was likewiſe receaued by the Biſhop and his Prieſts, at the doore of Saint <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> Church, where they ſung ſolemnly, a great <hi>te Deum laudamus,</hi> in the worſhip of him.</p>
               <p>Not long after, the ſaid Lord <hi>Eſpernon</hi> called together the Biſhop and his Prieſtes, the Maior and the Eſcheuins, the Kings officers and other chiefe Citizens, to giue them notice of the occaſions of his comming, which was firſt to preſerue them all in the Catholicke Romane religion, for the which, and for the Kings ſeruice he would willingly aduenture his life againſt all manner of men. Exhorting them to aduiſe what was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſit for their conſeruation, and that they would propound the ſame vnto him.</p>
               <p>All anſwered with one conſent, that they would dye vnder his authority in the ſame reſolution, and for to teſtify their willes the better, they would haue his authority from the King, printed, read, and publiſhed (as the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is) through all the towne.</p>
               <p>The ſaid Lord hauing many companies both of horſemen and footmen, yet would he innouate nothing, not ſo much as to change any part of the garriſon of the Citty: and to teſtify vnto them more apparantly of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, which hee had in the promiſes and fidelity of them, he would not
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:8966:143"/>
lodge in any ſtronger place (nor more aduantagious for his preſeruation) but in the Caſtell, which is called the Kings houſe: wherein he found his Coſin the Lord <hi>Tageus</hi> lodged, as the gouernours heretofore had accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1588.

This Caſtell hath no ſtrength which is any thing worth, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Ditches nor in any handy worke, except ſome great Towers of ſtone very olde: but otherwiſe very commodious for the ſtore of cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers which are therein. The ſaid Lord had brought his Lady with him, and had alſo lodged the Lady <hi>Tageus</hi> there. Hee went the ſame day into the Citadell, wherein he commaunded the Lord <hi>Bordes,</hi> with all the nobility which accompanied him, &amp; could euen then haue lodged there, if he had had any diffidence of the inhabitants: for the keies were preſented to him by the Lord <hi>Bordes.</hi> That Fortreſſe was ſufficient to haue bridled the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitantes, conſidering the ſtrength and great ſtore of Munitions of the ſaid place, as well in Ordinance as in other neceſſary things. But ſpecially hauing a gate to get out of the towne, whereby may be let in as many men as one would. But the ſayd Lord in ſtéed of miſtruſt kept an open houſe, as well for the nobility of the countrey, as for the inhabitantes of the citty, without any reſpect of perſons, whereof a great number (but ſpecially the Maior of the town with his conſpiratours) ſat ordinarily at his table, with great curteſy and welcome ſhewed vnto them by the ſayd L. <hi>Eſpernon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He walked familiarly with them through the citty and ſuburbs with a ſmall company of his, without any other care then to conferre louingly with them about the neceſſary thinges for the preſeruation of their Cittye.</p>
               <p>The Maior had in his poſſeſſion all the keies of the Cittie, the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantes made their accuſtomed watches, and by halfes, with two compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies which were vnder the commaundement of the Lord <hi>Bordes,</hi> whereof the moſt part were inhabitantes of the Citty.</p>
               <p>Vppon requeſt made vnto him by the Maior and Aldermen, concerning the neceſſary fortifications for the ſafety and increaſing of their Cittie, the ſaid Lord promiſed to lend them to that effect ſuch a ſumme of money as they ſhould thinke good. And to aduaunce the worke, the ſaid Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded the Maior, and the Lieutenant <hi>Neſmond</hi> to make the proiect, by the counſell of Captaine <hi>Ramel,</hi> ſon of <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> mayſter of the Kings workes.</p>
               <p>In the meane while the ſaid Lord cauſed the edict of reunion to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in the Cittie, and according to the ſame did prepare to war agaynſt them of the religion, to let them from gathering ſubſidies and tallages, &amp; to repreſſe their courſes: &amp; furthermore, had made an enterpriſe agaynſt one of their beſt places. And for a beginning of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> performance of theſe things, had commaunded his coſin the Lord <hi>Tageus</hi> to take with him all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of his light horſes, and the companyes of the Lords <hi>Sobelle,</hi> and <hi>Cadilan,</hi> with all the footmen, and troops which he had brought with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="273" facs="tcp:8966:143"/>
And beſides all this, for to win the hartes of the inhabitantes, he cauſed euery day all ſorts of publike exerciſes of Romiſh poperie to be done in all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1588. Auguſt"/> their chiefe Idoll Temples in the Cittie. He had alſo promiſed to the gray Fryers to helpe the reedifying of their couent and temple of the ſame.</p>
               <p>For the warre defenſiue and offenſiue agaynſt them of the religion, hee obmitted no meanes he had, no indſturie, nor diligence.</p>
               <p>For his paſtimes, he would go euery day (without miſtruſt of any man) to the Tenis court, ſituated in one of the furtheſt partes of the citty. Eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry morning he would get vppon his horſes himſelfe, to exerciſe them in the ſight of great aſſembly of people, with a very ſmall company of his men about him.</p>
               <p>It is ſayd how the King (to conuay the Lord <hi>Eſpernon,</hi> his truſty and faythfull ſeruant out of the ielouſies &amp; dangers of the Leaguers) ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The newes comming to the towne of the determination of the ſaide Duke, the complices of the conſpiracie of the League conſidering that neither to admit him, nor to exclude him was a ſafe way for them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that the King might recouer the town at all tymes by the citadel, which was kept by the L. <hi>Bordes,</hi> a faithfull ſeruant to his Prince, did im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly ſend one (who was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Maiors brother to the court) to know by the Oracle of the Leaguers, what was to be done in ſuch a doubtfull matter.</p>

               <p>At the ſame inſtant, the ſaid Lord <hi>Eſpernon,</hi> the Lord <hi>Mariuault,</hi> and the Abbot, heard two other piſtolls ſhot in the ſame wardrobe, with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie voyces, crying, kill, kill, &amp; comming to the ſaid doore, cryed, yeeld my Lord, for you are but a dead man.</p>
               <p>The Abbot and <hi>Mariuault</hi> then counſailed the ſayd <hi>Eſpernon,</hi> to keep within the cloſet where was a ſecond doore, very narrow &amp; hard to get in.

               <p>The Maior that morning intending to bring to an end their conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, had perſwaded them of his faction, but eſpecially 40. or 50. of the vileſt and moſt deſperat perſons of all the Citie, that his brother in law <hi>Southct</hi> came from the Court, and had brought with him an expreſſe commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the King, both by letters and word of mouth, to ſeaze vpon the perſon of the ſaid Lord <hi>Eſpernon,</hi> dead or aliue, and to aſſure the citie: ſome of them he had appoynted to run through the citie, and to giue the alarum, as is afore ſaid: ſome ſhould ſeaze vpon the gates of the Caſtell, when hee ſhould haue entred the ſaide Caſtell; and ſome ſhould goe with him to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute this murther. This vile traitor then head of the conſpiracy, entred firſt armed into the Caſtell, through the great gate, hauing two men booted with him, which as he ſaide were Purſeuants, whom he brought to ſpeake with the Duke, and followed with ten men, going vp into the hall, and paſſing through it, ſaluted the Lord <hi>Couplieres,</hi> who ſat vpon a table, and thence paſſing through the Lord <hi>Eſpernon</hi> his chamber, went as farre as the wardroabe, ſuppoſing there to finde him, and there to execute his dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable

conſpiracie, there he met with on <hi>Raphael Gyrolamy,</hi> a Gentleman Florentine, <hi>Rouillard</hi> and <hi>Segnencio,</hi> Secretaries, and one <hi>Sorline,</hi> the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1588.

The Lord <hi>Aubine,</hi> one of the Kings Magiſtrates in the Court of <hi>Engoleſme,</hi> who was expreſſely come to aduertiſe the Lorde <hi>Eſpernon,</hi> that there was ſome practiſe againſt him in the towne, and there he ſtayed for his comming foorth, to doo his meſſage. The Maior there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore entred as is ſaid, firſt of all armed with a Corſelet, into the wardrobe, with a Piſtoll in his hand ready charged, and the cock downe, came to <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line</hi> firſt, who ſet his hand to his ſword, and did hurt the Maior a little on the head.</p>
               <p>Another man (great and ſtrong) with a Piſtoll ſet vpon <hi>Raphael,</hi> who immediatly taking him by the coller, caſt him downe vppon the ground, and with his ſword wounded him, as he did three more, as they haue confeſſed after, and beate them out of the chamber, crying ſtill, my Lord is not here: but being wounded with a Piſtol, he fell downe, and then they made an end of him with their ſwords.

In the meane time while theſe things were dooing within the wardrobe by the Maior, his partakers went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout (as they had receaued inſtructions aforehand of the Maior) to ſeaze vpon the great gate of the Caſtell, for to bring in the people, who were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in armour: but they were let by ſome Gentlemen, who were in the Court of the Caſtell, ſtaying there for the Lorde <hi>Eſpernon</hi> his comming forth.</p>
               <p>The firſt were the Lordes <hi>Ambleuille, Beaurepayre, Sobelle,</hi> and others: in defending of the ſaid gate, the Lord <hi>Beaurepayre</hi> was ſlaine with the ſtroake of a Halbeard, the Prouoſt <hi>Baretes</hi> likewiſe, and one of the gardes, the Lord <hi>Clauery</hi> was hurt: certaine Gentlemen entred into the ſaid gate, afore it was ſhut vp, as Captaine <hi>Baron Artiges,</hi> the Countie <hi>Brune,</hi> brother in lawe to the Duke <hi>Eſpernon,</hi> the Lords <hi>Goas, Mirane, Coſte, Emars,</hi> and others.</p>
               <p>They beleeued then that the Lord <hi>Eſpernon</hi> was dead, ſo that being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtonied and looked one vpon another, they knewe not what to doo, nor in whome to truſt, vntill that the Lords <hi>Ambleuille, Myran, Sobelle,</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mars,</hi> acknowledging one another, and giuing hands with promiſe, to dye together, gathered as well Gentlemen as Souldiours of the garde cloſe together, and ran to the Chamber doore of the Lord <hi>Eſpernon,</hi> through the which the conſpiratours would haue gone forth, to ſeaze vpon the tower of the Caſtell, but they were let by the Gentlemen and gardes, who wounded the Maior through the doore, where of he fell downe, they ſhot alſo againſt

               <p>The conſpirators were enforced to ſaue themſelues in that Chamber nigh the great tower, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which no man could go but by a payre of ſtaires ſo narrowe, that but one man alone might paſſe: there were none armed, neither the Lord <hi>Eſpernon,</hi> nor any of his were at all; which thing cauſed them to ſtay their going vp.</p>
               <p>At the ſame inſtant a maidſeruant aduertiſed the Lord <hi>Eſpernon,</hi> that the Maiors brother with a number of armed men, did enter into the caſtle through a hole in the wall on the ſide of the Curtine. The ſayd Lord <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernon</hi> ran thether, who found alreadie the Maiors brother entred with an<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>other, which both were ſlaine there, and a gard was put at the place.</p>
               <p>At the ſame time, the complices of the conſpiracie, and among others the foreſaid <hi>Souchet,</hi> the Maiors brother in law, who had come lately from the Court, with ſome other gentlemen of the countrey, ſeeing that they could not fire the firſt gate, where they found reſiſtance (as is ſayd before) ran to another gate of the Caſtle with fire to burne it, preparing alſo gi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s to breake it vp. But the Lord <hi>Eſpernon</hi> with fiftéene of his men, whom he had gathered together, ran alſo to the ſayd gate, to defend and fortifie it with earth, ſtones, boords, and ſuch like, leauing his gard to keepe the dore of the chamber where the conſpirators were locked vp, the which ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured themſelues to iſſue foorth, but notwithſtanding were repulſed by the ſayd gardes and the Lord <hi>Eſpernon</hi> himſelfe, who hauing deuided his gardes vpon the entries into the Caſtle, went too and fro as néed required, and where hee iudged his preſence neceſſarie; ſo that reſorting to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayd doore, he killed one of the ſayd conſpiratours with his own hand, as he went about to iſſue foorth. The inhabitants in the meane time did beſtowe their ſhot freely vppon the chambers of the Caſtle, becauſe they were ſo great and wide, and becauſe the inhabitants had ſeazed vpon the next hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and among others, vppon the houſe néereſt to the Caſtle, called the Quéenes houſe.</p>
               <p>The diligence of the Lord <hi>Eſpernon,</hi> and other gentlemen which accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied him was ſuch, that within two houres they aſſured themſelues of the Caſtle: ſo that it had béen hard for the gentlemen and others who were
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:8966:146"/>
within the Towne, to force it without Canon.</p>
               <p>The labour beſtowed in fighting, fortifying, and breaking the ſtaiers of the chambers, and in fiering the narrowe ſtaiers which went vp the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1588.

               <p>The L. <hi>Eſperno<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> deſirous to make the gentlemen which were with him to drinke, there was found in al the houſe but foure flagons of wine, which were brought in that morning for his breakfaſt: there was no water at all, and very ſmall ſtore of bread, for the inhabitants had ſeazed vpon the well which was in the other court, and alſo the way to goe to it; which thing did greatly trouble them that were beſieged, the ſpace of two dayes and a halfe that they were incloſed therein. But the diſcommoditie was little in compariſon of the conſtant reſolution which they tooke, rather to dye then yéeld themſelues vnto that ſedicious multitude.</p>
               <p>It is ſayd before, how the Maior afore hee began to execute his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, had by falſe ſurmiſes entiſed the Lord <hi>Bordes,</hi> gouernour of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tadell, to come to his houſe, making him beléeue that hee would diſcouer him ſome great practiſe againſt the King; whom when he had in his hands he kept priſoner in his houſe.</p>
               <p>This thing did greatly amaze the Lord <hi>Eſpernon</hi> that he heard not the Citadell play againſt the Citie: the cauſe was, that when the fray was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun at the Caſtle, immediatly men appoynted by the Maior, brought the ſayd <hi>Bordes</hi> before the Citadell, to cauſe the Lieutenant to ſurrender it, or els to ſtay him from diſcharging the Ordinance againſt the towne, which in caſe hee ſhould doo it, they threatned to kill the ſayd Lord <hi>Bordes.</hi> The Lieutenant deſirous to ſaue the life of the ſayd Lord <hi>Bordes,</hi> promiſed to doo their requeſt, and ſo kept promiſe with them. The Lord <hi>Eſpernon</hi> ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of all theſe things, was greatly diſmayed, fearing leaſt the Citadell had béen in the hands of the conſpirators, or els had fauoured them. The conſpirators cloſed vp in the high chamber of the Caſtle, did affirme the ſame, and when they were ſummoned to render themſelues, they anſwered that it was for the ſayd Lord <hi>Eſpernon</hi> and his to yeeld, &amp; that they ſhould quickly ſee the Canon of the Citadell before the Caſtle.</p>
               <p>There was an other miſchaunce that happened. The Ladie <hi>Eſpernon</hi> before the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>motion began, was gone to Maſſe to the Dominican friers. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the alarum was giuen, ſhe went about to go forth to get the citadel ouer her head, beleeuing that they were Hugonets that had attempted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> town; ſhe was lead by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> armes by 2. gentlemen to wit, <hi>Seguency</hi> (not the ſecretary, but an other of that name) &amp; <hi>Pial:</hi> ſhe was arreſted pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, and her two Gentlemen ſlaine by theſe two Catholicks, within the Church doore, not permitting the Prieſt to make an ende of his iuggling game. They tooke alſo many Gentlemen, among whom were the Lords <hi>Curee, Meſme, Blere,</hi> and Captaine <hi>Ramel,</hi> the Baron <hi>Coze,</hi> and many
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:8966:146"/>
others of all degrees, of the traine of the ſaid Lord <hi>Eſpernon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Lords <hi>Curee</hi> and <hi>Meſme,</hi> went about to get into the Caſtell, but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1588. Auguſt"/> the people with Holbards kept them back, although they ſaide that they would go fight againſt the Hugonets, when they aſſaid to haue entred the Caſtel. The Lord <hi>Haultclerie</hi> (a man of that countrey of great eſtimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) with much adoo ſaued their liues.</p>
               <p>Captaine <hi>Ramel</hi> fell into the ſame daunger of the people, in going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to get into the caſtell, by the Curtine of the towne wall, but he ſaued himſelfe by taking the Biſhops houſe.</p>
               <p>In the middeſt of all theſe diſcommodities, the Lord <hi>Eſpernon</hi> ſendeth a Lackie to the Lord <hi>Tageus,</hi> who was at <hi>Xainctes</hi> with all his horſemen, to make haſte to ſuccour him. The Lacky was let downe the wall of the Parke ioyning to the Caſtell, but he was incontinently taken by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants. Notwithſtanding the Lord <hi>Tageus</hi> was aduertized of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion by two Gentlemen, who in a good houre went forth of the towne to goe on to hunting, who hearing the Toxin, did gallop vnto the gate of the Citadell, where they cauſed immediately all the bread and prouiſion which was in the ſubburb to be brought in, and the ſelfe ſame day at night came to <hi>Xainctes,</hi> to warne the Lord <hi>Tageus</hi> of that commotion.</p>
               <p>The people in the meane while continued in their rage, aſſiſted and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by diuers gentlemen of the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try, who were of the league, among whome was one (brought vp in the houſe of <hi>Guyze) Meſſeliere Mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uole,</hi> and <hi>Boucheaulx,</hi> and others, who two houres after the commotion ſummoned the Lord <hi>Eſpernon</hi> by a drumme to yeeld, and to deliuer the place into their hands, promiſing him and his life and baggage ſafe.</p>
               <p>That proffer he diſdayned, and gaue them no other anſwere, but that he would within few houres make them change their language. They threatned alſo the Lady <hi>Eſpernon</hi> (if ſhe would not perſwade her huſband to yeeld) to make her ſerue for a gabion, or elſe to ſtabb her. She anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them, that if they would bring her before the Caſtell, ſhe would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade him to the contrary: and that ſhe did hope one day to haue reaſon of the inſolencies of the ſaid <hi>Mere,</hi> who did proffer her ſuch ſpeeches.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Eſpernon</hi> had but eight Harquebuſiers of his guard, they neuer ſhot without killing or hurting ſome one or other; ſo that there were killed by them. 25. or thirtie perſons: but this was their euill luck, that they had no powder with them but that which they found in their flaſks. One of the conſpirators who was ſhut vp in the Caſtel, with linnen cloth cut in length, and knotted in the endes in ſtead of a coarde, was let down into to the Caſtell ditche, and aduertized the inhabitants, howe that his felowes were ready almoſt to be ſtifled with fire, or quelled with the fall of the houſe, which could not bee auoyded, except they were very ſhortly reſcued. That moued the Parents to induce the other Mayor, named

                  <hi>Bourgoyne,</hi> to goe to the Caſtell to parley.</p>
               <p>The Abbot <hi>Elbeu</hi> and the Lord <hi>Ambleuille</hi> ſpake with him through a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1588.

And that it they ſhould goe further in their enterprize, and aſſault any more the Caſtell, the Lorde <hi>Eſpernon</hi> would ſtay them all. Furthermore, they offer themſelues to make meanes for the people with the ſaid Lord <hi>Eſpernon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They which were ſhut vp being no more able to endure, yeelded vnto the Lord <hi>Eſpernon</hi> vpon his faith, which he kept to them inuiolable. The Maior at the time of his yeelding, was gaping for life, and within a while after dyed in the caſtell of the wounds which he had receiued.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Eſpernon</hi> cauſed his priſoners to write to them of the towne in what danger they were of their liues, if they ſhould any more aſſault the Caſtell. Whereupon the inhabitants required the Maior <hi>Bourgoyne</hi> to returne to the Duke <hi>Eſpernon</hi> in the behalfe of them, that he would ſend the Abbot and the Lord <hi>Ambleuille</hi> to them, to intreate of peace. The Lord <hi>Ambleuille</hi> would not forſake the Duke <hi>Eſpernon.</hi> The Abbot preffered himſelfe ſo that they would giue hoſtages. They of the towne gaue the Kings procurator, who entred into the Caſtell by a ladder, by the which the Abbot came downe into the towne.</p>
               <p>The Abbot at the firſt trenches, found <hi>Mere</hi> and <hi>Meſſeliere,</hi> two Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, fir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Being conducted thither, all the officers and chiefe of the Citie, with much people, reſorted to the place. The Abbot ſhewed them the enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of their of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The common people (induced by <hi>Mere)</hi> ſhewed themſelues void of all capacity, of reaſon, and intractable. Many ſpéeches and reaſonings paſſed in this conference, the people fell to mutiny agayne, and bidding the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot to make ſhort, proffered him like conditions as before. The Abbot cut them ſhort, and aſſured them that the day following after noone, the Lord <hi>Eſpernon</hi> ſhould giue them the law.</p>
               <p>The ſeditious Leagued <hi>Mere,</hi> whom we haue ſaid to haue béen brought vp in the houſe of <hi>Guyze,</hi> the ſchoole of treaſons and ſeditions, did heate the people by an aſſured promiſe, which hee made to them of an infallible ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour of the Lord of <hi>Aubeterre,</hi> who as hee ſayd was at hand: to whom al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the Lord <hi>Vileroy,</hi> the Kings ſecretary, had written to that effect.</p>
               <p>The Abbot departing thence, went (not without payne and danger) to viſit the Lady <hi>Eſpernon,</hi> and commended her vnto a company of gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, who were aſſembled there, and proteſted reuenge agaynſt them, which ſhould proffer her iniury.</p>

               <p>The morrow after beeing the twelfth day of Auguſt, the alarum was geuen in the Towne by the Drum and Toxin, and as well the gentlemen, the people, the Leagued, and others who were not of the conſpiracie, were enforced to take armor to go to the breach, which they prepared and hoped to make in a weake place of the Caſtle wall, defended neither with any window, nor otherwiſe flanked. Some ſmall opening beeing made, the people preſented themſelues, where they were receaued: and there was flayne the Lord <hi>Fleurak,</hi> one of the Leaguers.</p>
               <p>About three a clocke in the morning, the people heard the trompets of the light horſemen of the Lord <hi>Eſpernon,</hi> which made them beleeue that ſuccou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>At this new thundering from the Citadell, they of the Towne began to wauer, and to draw on agayne to parley, and do deſire that the Abbot would returne, and that they would harken to the propoſitions of the ſaid

               <p>As they were all ready there to ſigne the agreement, behold a new commotion of the people, who will not compound: the reaſon was the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryuing into the towne of the Baron of <hi>Tonnerak,</hi> with diuers gentlemen of the League, alſo of captayne <hi>Caze</hi> Marſhall of the lodgings of the L. <hi>Aubeterre,</hi> who do aſſure them, that the ſayd Lord of <hi>Aubeterre</hi> will come with ſuccour to them the next day morning, with three hundred horſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and fiue hundred footmen.</p>
               <p>The Abbot by theſe occaſions was enforced to get him to the caſtle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne with greater danger then at the firſt, by reaſon of the raging of this Leagued people. For they brought him by force before the Citadell, to forbid the Souldiers to diſcharge the ordinance agaynſt the towne: which thing notwithſtanding in a while after they continued to do, becauſe that the people aſſaulted the caſtell continually vppon a vayne hope, incited by thoſe leagued gentlemen newly come.</p>
               <p>The chiefeſt officers of the King, and Bourgeſes of the Citty, hauing duly conſidered in the Biſhops houſe, the danger wherin their citty ſtood, if ſo many ſtrangers on euery ſyde ſhould come in, ioyned themſelues with the cheefeſt Gentlemen agaynſt the reſt who were ſtubburne. They ſent agayne 2. of the chiefeſt Bourgeſes to the Lord <hi>Eſpernon,</hi> to beſeech him that it may pleaſe him that the Lord <hi>Tageus</hi> his kinſman newly arryued in the Suburbs with his companies, might ſigne and ſeale the agréement, to the which they added onely, that they who were detayned priſoners in the caſtell, ſhould be compriſed therein and ſet at liberty, according to the fayth which he had geuen them, promiſing of their part to do the like to them, whom they did detayne, and all that which had been taken in the houſes ſhould be reſtored.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Eſpernon</hi> graunting vnto them their demaund, ſent againe the Abbot, who went forth with them of the towne to the Lord <hi>Tageus,</hi> to make him ſeale the compoſition, which was done about foure a clocke in the euening.</p>
               <p>Within a while after the trenches were broken, the people went away, the Lady <hi>Eſpernon</hi> was conducted by the ſayd Abbot into the caſtell, with all the priſoners detayned in the towne.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Bordes</hi> entred the Citadell, the conſpiratours, and Maiors fellowes, who were priſoners in the caſtell were ſet at liberty.</p>

               <p>The dead on both ſides were quietly buried, and namely the Maior, whoſe corps with the corps of his brother, were freely deliuered to their friends to be buried.</p>
               <p>When the agreement was concluded, it was nine and thirtie houres that neither the Lord <hi>Eſpernon</hi> nor any of his, had eate nor dronk. There was no more powder for the ſhot: he had determined the night following to iſſue forth vpon the enemies for to ſeaze vpon the well, hee alſo looked that night to be reſcued by his men: to be ſhort, by the ſinguler goodnes of God he eſcaped a perilous ſnare of the Leaguers &amp; a marueilous great danger, for the which to auoyde, hee ſhewed himſelfe both valiaunt and watchfull, and if he would be thankfull to God for ſo great deliuerance, and conſider from whence, &amp; for what cauſe theſe blowes came, he ſhould doe the part of a right noble man.</p>

               <p>The King conſidering the ſhortnes of the time, reiourned his eſtates, vntill the beginning of October, following whatſoeuer other cauſes did moue him ſo to doo.

But the Duke of <hi>Guize</hi> had ſo laboured of long time, and ſo reduced the people, that there was almoſt no citie, towne nor prouince in all <hi>France,</hi> but the complices of the Leaguers (vnder colour of zeale of religion) preuailed, in ſending ſuch as were altogether factious and deſirous of innouations, the Kings ſecret enemies, and moſt falſe traytors to their king and countrey, hyding al their intended treaſons vnder the old gabardin of the Catholike religion.</p>
               <p>Theſe conſpirators againſt God, their King and their Countrey, being come at length from euery part of the realme, the ſecond day of October <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="October"/> being the Lords day, the King cauſed a generall proceſſion to bee made with great ſolemnitie from the Temple of Saint <hi>Sauiour,</hi> which is in the court of the Caſtle vnto the Temple, commonly called our Ladie of helpe in the Suburbe <hi>

               </p>
               <p>There was in this proceſſion great magnificencie and outward appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of deuotion, but as little godlines &amp; loue as could be. The King, the Quéenes, the Princes and Princeſſes, Lords &amp; Ladies which were at the Court, &amp; generally all the people, as well ſtrangers as inhabitants of that place, were at it, there they offered vnto their gods, which did ſtand gazing in their temples, with great ſtore of diſſimulation and hippocriſie.

               <p>In the ſaide proceſſion, the King with all the States, marched in this order following. The formoſt of all were the Frie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

They were followed of the nobilitie, and after them marched in battaile aray, the deputies of the Clergie in long gownes, and ſquare caps onely: next after them went the Archbiſhops, and Biſhops with their rochets: after the Biſhops, went their God, otherwiſe called by the Prophet, <hi>Idolum vastans,</hi> by ſome <hi>Corpus Domini,</hi> and by ſome <hi>Corpus Christi,</hi> &amp; by ſome the Sacrament of the Altar. It was the ſame God, by whome the King with all his Lords and traine did dayly, and at euerie word ſweare by. That God was arayed in pure beaten Gold, and had beene ſo beaten and turmoyled by the hereticks, theſe 27. yeares before, that he was gone ſo weake, that it could not goe, but was carried verie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murely by the Biſhop of <hi>Aix</hi> in <hi>Prouance,</hi> vnder a Canapie. This Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py could not goe neither, no more then their God, but was caried by foure Knights of the holy Ghoſt: they ſung continuallie ſo many <hi>gaudeamus,</hi> ſo many <hi>ſalue fest a dies,</hi> and ſo many <hi>aleluia,</hi> and ſo many <hi>ora pro nobis,</hi> and ſo many black <hi>ſanctus,</hi> that it was too bad, and that with ſuch melodie, that a man would haue thought that all the Cuckoos of the ſpring, and all the Owles of winter had mett together, to try who could make the pretier noyſe.</p>
               <p>The King followed that company, with the Queenes and Princes, and other Lords of the court. After they had walked their God through the ſtreats to take ayre, and to recreate him a little, hauing beene kept ſo long in very ſtraight and cloſe priſon: at length in that order they came all to the Temple of our Lady of help, where the Archbiſhop of <hi>Bourges</hi> iugled and charmed the Maſſe, plaied with his God, as the Cat with the mouſe, and at length eate him vp. The Biſhop of <hi>Eureulx</hi> babled out a Sermon as well as he could: And that done, haue with you to good cheare.</p>
               <p>This was ſuch a painfull iourney to thoſe ghoſtly fathers, but ſpecially for the Biſhop of <hi>Aix,</hi> to carie all the way ſuch a heauie fardell, that S. <hi>Chriſtopher</hi> was neuer more combred with his burthen, than this piller of the holy Church was with his. They would do nothing all that weeke, but eate, drink, ſleepe, and doe worſe, as theſe ghoſtly fathers can doe that well.</p>
               <p>The 9. day of Octob. the K. the Lords &amp; deputies of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> three eſtats, were houſed together at the Friery of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> frantick franciſca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Friers.

It began with heatheniſh ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition and Idolatry, it ended with heatheniſh murthers and diſloyall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion.</p>
               <p>As this was done to confirme the vnion and correſpondence which was betweene them, for performing of their enterprize: of which thing by the meanes of this vnion euery man conceaued ſo good hope, that nowe they made no doubt but all would goe well.</p>
               <p>This done, the K. delayed the propoſition of the States to the ſixteenth of October, willing in the meane time the officers of the aſſembly in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry order to be choſen.</p>

               <p>But the headlings of the League, had greater things in their brayne than all this: for they were day and night conſulting how to make an end of all their labours.</p>

               <p>He proteſteth alſo of his great ſorrowe which he hath felt in the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and oppreſſions of his ſubiects, acknowledging the ſame to bee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured by his and their offences in generall.</p>

               <p>And calling heauen and earth to witnes, proteſteth the fayth of God and men, that the fault ſhall not remayne in him if the realme be not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, but in them if they do abandon their lawfull King in ſuch an holy &amp; laudable action.</p>

               <p>The 18. of October, the King came into the hall with the body of the States, for the ſecond ſeſſion, where he began to ſay as followeth.</p>
               <p>Sirs, I haue teſtified vnto you, on Sonday laſt, the deſire which I haue alwaies to ſee, during my raigne, all my faithfull ſubiects reunited in the true Catholick Romiſh religion, vnder that authority which it hath pleaſed God to giue me ouer you: and hauing to the ſame effect made my edict of Iuly laſt paſt, that it might be holden for a fundamental law of this realme, to binde both you and your poſteritie, to the intent that now the ſame may be confirmed before me, as made by the common conſent of you al, and that
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:8966:152"/>
no man may pretend ignorance of the nature and ofſpring of it, and that it may haue the marke of a fundamentall law of the realme for euer; I will that this edict bee now read with a loude voyce, and bee knowne of all, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1588. Octobe."/> and after that, ſworne vnto by all the States, to the which thing, I will ſweare firſt of all, that my holy intent may be knowne both of God and men.</p>
               <p>The King hauing ended his ſpeach, commaunded <hi>Ruze,</hi> one of his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretaries of eſtate, to reade with a loud voyce, the declaration which he had made the ſame day, vpon his edict of reunion.</p>
               <p>Wherein he firſt ſheweth his great and feruent deſire, which hee hath had from his youth, and the noble acts which he hath done, for the rooting out of hereſie: alſo how he hath vſed all gentle waies, to call the hereticks to the holy Church againe.</p>
               <p>But conſidering that all this would not ſerue, but onely to make them more obſtinate, he dooth declare himſelfe, to haue made the edict of reunion, for an irreuocable lawe of the realme, condemning already by this his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, all ſuch as will not ſweare nor obey the ſame, as guiltie of high treaſon.</p>
               <p>This declaration being read, then followed the edict of reunion by the ſame Secretary, which being done, the Arſhbiſhop of <hi>Bourges</hi> made a long exhortation to the States, vpon the ſolemne oath to be taken by the King, and required alſo to be taken by his ſubiects, for the obſeruing of the ſaide edict.</p>
               <p>This faire and learned ſermon, about a naughtie matter, and to couer their diſſembling heart.</p>
               <p>Firſt, did ſpeak of the truth, and of lying, then ſhewed the vſe of an oath, the neceſſitie, the forme and qualities thereof.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he ſpeaketh of the Church, which he ſaith in ſome reſpect to be viſible, and in ſome reſpects inuiſible, and that it is gathered of diuers nations and degrees of men, without acceptation and diſtinction of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
               <p>He ſaith that it is called the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in none other ſence, then that it imbraceth the word of God, and true doctrine, which S. <hi>Peter</hi> there taught, to the which all other Churches haue vnited themſelues, by a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall and vniuerſall conſent: hee ſaith that the triumphant and militant Church, is but one in effect. And that this Church is grounded onely vpon the ſtone, which is Chriſt, the true foundation and head corner ſtone there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and that it hath ſuſtained many aſſaultes, which haue not preuailed. He ſaith alſo, that out of that Church, there is nothing but death, and that hee who will not holde the ſame for his mother, cannot haue God for his Father.</p>

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted into the right way.</p>
               <p>Now my Lord, ſhall I bee ſo bould to ſpeake one word to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: what way will you follow to conuert them from their errour, as you ſay they are in? my Lorde Biſhop will anſwer, that hee will firſt ſhewe them their errour, and then teach them the certitude of his doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine.</p>
               <p>Then my good Lord (I pray you be not angry) why haue you denied this way to the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> &amp; to the reformed Churches of <hi>France,</hi> which onely thing they haue deſired?</p>
               <p>When once you haue followed that way, and haue conuerted them of errour, and taught them a better way, if they ſhew themſelues obſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="292" facs="tcp:8966:153"/>
vpon Gods worde, the infallable rule of veritie; then you will lay downe your fantaſies &amp; traditions, flowing out of the darke illumination of your <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1588.

               <p>But what if they will not take your <hi>ſic volo, ſic iubeo,</hi> for reaſons which may induce them to ſubſcribe to your abiuration, and will not ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to bee cut off neither, being not conuincted of error, but ſtand to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themſelues againſt an vniuerſall contumelie, iniurie and violence? What will you doo?</p>
               <p>My Lord Biſhop hearing this newes: what, will they neither beléeue vs, neither ſuffer themſelues to be burned for our pleaſures? Now all my Lords religion is turned into madneſſe; his zeale to rage; his authoritie to tyrannie, and his mildnes (that holy Church doth not couet after blood) is turned to murther.</p>
               <p>Then my Lord in his furie and in the trance of his hart he crieth: Open the Kings Arſeuall, bring foorth his Ordinance, gather together his men of armes and footmen, and if néede bee the whole Realme, ſet vpon them, kill them, ſlaſh them, cut them, ſpoyle them, murther them, and worſe if you can. This is not to warre (quoth my Lord) no, no, holy Church thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth not after bloud.</p>
               <p>But here is good play which I doo offer you, ſeeing that you muſt néedes to warre, there is in <hi>France</hi> many legions of diuells of your haire, put on your carnall armour, (for the ſpirituall armour you haue loſt long agoe) let your Myter ſerue you for an Helmet, your Rochets for Corſlets, your Surpleſſes for ſhirts of male, your Croſſes for pikes, your Croſier ſtaues for Launces, your red roundaches which the Cardinalls doo weare vpon their heads, for Targets; your Holy water taſſels for Clubbes; put on your Spectacles too, that you may the better aime at your enemie; call vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon all the he Saints and ſhe Saints, which the Popes haue deified with thouſands of <hi>Ora pro nobis;</hi> ſet you all in battell aray, be fiue againſt one, méete the heretikes if you dare in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> plaine open field. I aduiſe you, though you be deſperate enough, not to come within their reach, leaſt that with ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinadoes the pockes and the gowtes be wrong out of your rotten boanes againſt your wills.</p>
               <p>But to returne to the purpoſe, he exhorteth the States to vnite them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and to ſweare the foreſayd edict: which ſpeaches being ended, the King tooke the word thus.</p>
               <p>Sir, you haue heard the contents of mine edict, and vnderſtand the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of the ſame, the greatnes and worthines of the oth which you be about now to ſweare. And ſeeing that I perceiue your iuſt deſires to agree with
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:8966:153"/>
mine, I will ſweare, and doo ſweare before God in a good conſcience, the obſeruing of this mine edict as long as God ſhall continue my life here, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1588.

               <p>Now by this, hee in his owne perſon and his ſubiects haue ſworne an immortall warre in his Realme, of which thing he commaundeth an act to bee made in writing to ſerue for a perpetuall remembrance of the fact. The act is ſuch as followeth.</p>
               <p>This day the 18. of <hi>October</hi> 1588. the King ſitting at <hi>Bloys</hi> in the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblie of his generall ſtates of his Realme, hath ſworne in his faith and word of a King, to obſerue this preſent lawe in all that ſhall concerne his Maieſtie. Alſo the Lords, Cardinalls of <hi>Bourbon, Vendoſme,</hi> Princes of <hi>Soyſſons</hi> and <hi>Monpenſier,</hi> Cardinalls of <hi>Guize, Leuoncourt</hi> and <hi>Gundy,</hi> Dukes of <hi>Guize, Nemours, Neuers</hi> and <hi>Retes,</hi> the Lord Kéeper, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Lords, aſwell of his Counſell as Commiſſioners of the three e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates of his Realme, haue ſworne to kéepe and entertaine inuiolable the ſayd lawe, as well in their proper names, as in the names of the Prouinces which haue ſent them to the ſaid aſſemblie of the States.</p>
               <p>This thing being done, the King teſtified the great deſire which he had to make an end of this aſſemblie, and to prouide for all his ſubiects vppon their iuſt complaints and grieues: and for that end promiſed not to depart out of <hi>Bloys,</hi> vntill the finall end of the ſaid eſtates: commanding likewiſe them of that aſſemblie, not to depart by any meanes: whereof they gaue him moſt humble thankes.</p>
               <p>The aſſemblie diſmiſſed, the King, the Quéenes, Princes and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, Cardinalls, Prelates, and other Lords, with all the deputies of the States went to the Church S. <hi>Sauiour,</hi> there to ſing <hi>te Deum,</hi> where they were alwayes accompanied with a generall voyce of the people, crying, God ſaue the King; ſhewing an extreame ioy and gladneſſe for their owne calamities and miſeries which they had ſworne.</p>
               <p>Now (good Chriſtian Reader) conſider well three things in this hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, to ſee Gods wrath, iuſtice and mercy; the thing which they haue done; the miſeries which haue followed; and the gracious godnes of God in vpholding the ruines and miſerable fall of that kingdome.</p>
               <p>For firſt in this ſeſſion, Gods wrath drawing them to work, to ſweare, and to reioyce in their owne dreadfull deſtruction, they haue degraded and diſherited the Princes of the moſt noble and ancienteſt family of the
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:8966:154"/>
world, from that inheritance and preheminence, which God, Nature, and Law had appoynted vnto them: whoſe aunceſtors haue gouerned that kingdome with iuſtice and equitie, aboue thirteene hundred yeares: And <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1588.

But O thou moſt higheſt, rayſe vp thy ſelfe, bruſe them like a Potters veſſell. What hath followed that execrable oath? Firſt, the moſt wretched and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous death of the chiefeſt authors of this coniuring and witchcraft. Secondly, an vniuerſall rebellion againſt him, who ſware firſt and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred the oath to others.</p>
               <p>I am not a Prophet, nor the ſonne of a Prophet, yet thus much I dare affirme, grounded vpon the nature of Gods iuſtice, who ſayth, that who ſhall do thoſe abominations ſhall die the death. That peace ſhall neuer be reſtored to <hi>France,</hi> as long as there is one left aliue of that damnable and accurſed company, who with that abomination haue poluted the land, either in their mind haue giuen approbation vnto that accurſed execrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and vntill the Lord hath waſhed away the polution of their execrable deede with their owne blood.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all, here we haue to conſider the Lordes prouidence, in relee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of the afflicted States and tottering kingdomes, that he whom they had ſworne ſhould not raigne ouer them, him I ſay the Lord hath ſet vp, and annoyuted him with the oyle of grace and wiſedome, and ſaid that he ſhall raigne ouer them, that it may appeare that his Scepter is of God. And wheras likewiſe they haue ſworn the rooting out of Gods truth, the Lord wil make it floriſh vnder their noſes, &amp; vnder the authoritie of him whome they haue reiected.</p>
               <p>Here alſo is another thing worthy to be noted, that the Lorde in all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, for to reſtore peace, iudgement, iuſtice, and religion, in any decayed ſtate, hath rayſed vp Princes, endued with heroycall giftes and graces, called by the ancients, <hi>Nemeſis,</hi> &amp; by the Prophet <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. the principall ſpirit of force, conſtancie, iuſtice, wiſedome, counſell, and godlines, by the which crooked things are made ſtraight, and all things reduced to their order. For as fortitude in an hot and vnwiſe nature is tranſformed into a barbarous cruelty &amp; rage, ſo the ſame being in a wiſe nature, gouerneth the victory with mercy and mild<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But thou O great King, iſſued out of Noble race, gird thy loynes with force and might, goe on ſtill and follow the Lord, who goeth before <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1588.

But this furniture could not arriue at <hi>Beauuoyre</hi> in fifteene dayes after the ſiege was begun, by reaſon of contrary windes, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall rayne, with the diſcommodity of the waies, the countrey beeing very mooriſh.</p>
               <p>The ſouldiers were in the water to the mid legge, with other great diſcommities: notwithſtanding, they ceaſed not to make trenches vnto the very ditch, out of the which he drewe great ſtore of water: ſo that the platformes being made, the Ordinance brought with much ado, being pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and leuelled, he began the 21. of October to batter, and after 30.

               <p>The King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> loſt at that ſiege two Gentlemen, to wit, the Lord <hi>Drow,</hi> one of his houſe, and one <hi>Villebeau,</hi> Captaine of one of the companies of the Lord <hi>Salignak.</hi>

The inhabitants of the Iland <hi>Bouing</hi> had promiſed to the King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarre,</hi> (who had vſed them very courteouſly) that they would ſuffer none <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1588.

               <p>The Lord of <hi>Guize</hi> (though very buſie at the States at <hi>Bloys)</hi> yet cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed not, but as he was very buſie to ſupplant the King at home, ſo was he very diligent to prouide for the affayres of warre, and for to croſſe in this ſiege the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> if he could. He ſent to the Duke <hi>Mercure</hi> the regiment of S. <hi>Paule,</hi> the fayreſt and moſt dreadfull of all the companies of the League.</p>
               <p>The 22. of October and the morrowe after the rendering of the Caſtle of <hi>Beauuoyre,</hi> the inhabitants of the Iland <hi>Bouing,</hi> againſt their promiſe, receiued two of the fayreſt companies of the ſayd regiment of S.

But they had not ſo ſoone entered into the Iland, but that immediatly they tooke ſuch dreadfull feare, that without any ſhame they ſent a Drumme to the ſaid king, to beſeech him to giue them ſafe conduct to retyre into a place of ſafetie. They had ſome reaſon ſo to doo, for the feare of his ſworde put them in a fearefull apprehenſion. For he had ſo prouided that they were at his mercie, hauing ſent his nauall armie to a place called <hi>Collet,</hi> aboue <hi>Bourgneuf</hi> of <hi>Rhe,</hi> which was the place where of force they muſt needes paſſe by. But the accuſtomed clemencie of that Prince ſuſtayned and eaſed the feare of theſe two companies, who truſted that he would be no leſſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourable to them, then hee hath accuſtomably béen vnto others, who did ſubmit themſelues vnto him. Whereof they themſelues (among many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther examples) are and ought to bee hereafter witneſſes: for although hée might haue cut them in peeces, yet of his good will (leauing a marke of heroicall humanitie vnto the poſteritie) he gaue them their liues &amp; armour, with a paſport for their ſafe returne, ſo that they ſhould retyre the ſelfe ſame day.</p>
               <p>He forgaue alſo the Iland men, who had falſified their faith, and had ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered themſelues worthie of ſharpe puniſhment. This clemencie to them ſhewed did ſo touch them, that they haue remayned euer ſince moſt faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, being otherwiſe moſt deuoted and addicted vnto poperie.</p>
               <p>The ſaide King being deſirous to paſſe into the Iland to ſée it, could not doo it for the contrarie windes: hee left there for gouernour the Lorde <hi>Quergroy,</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Britayn,</hi> of great reputation, with a neceſſarie Gariſon.</p>
               <p>And vpon the aduertiſements which he receaued of the great prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and marching of the royall army, vnder the conduct of the Duke of <hi>Neuers,</hi> who deſcended into <hi>Poytow,</hi> he departed thence the 24. of October with all his army, taking his way to <hi>Montagne,</hi> where hee left the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lorde <hi>Preau,</hi> ordering all neceſſary things for the defence of that place, which as was thought ſhould be the firſt place, where to that ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my

               <p>That being done, he tooke his way to <hi>Rochel,</hi> to be at the aſſembly of all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Nouemb."/> the reformed Churches of <hi>France,</hi> which hee had called thethere for diuers and notable conſiderations.

was too apparant (for they went euen againſt the King and the whole eſtate) he ſhewed that hee had hetherto, in ſo iuſt and godly a cauſe, ſpared <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1588.

               <p>He ſhewed how the long continuance of war, and liſence of armes, had to his great griefe, bred and brought in many diſorders, to the which hee required them, as well it might bée, to prouide both in reſpect of the glorie of God, of the King, of the realme, and in reſpect of all priuat men.

               <p>Aboue all things, hee willed them to prouide for that which imported moſt of all, the glorie and ſeruice of God, the good order, policie, and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of the Church. And to auoyde the prouoking of Gods wrath, by ſwearing, blaſphemies, rapes, whordomes, robberies, forbidden games, and other diſorders, who had crept among many, by the vnhappines of war: the required that the lawes made, for repreſſing of ſuch things, might bee ſtraightly enioyned, commaunded and obſerued by the Magiſtrates, without any diſſimulation, ſupport or reſpect of perſons: commaunding al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the Magiſtrates to aſſiſt euery one in his behalfe, vppon great paines, that the Diſcipline of the Church may haue a due authoritie and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</p>

               <p>This enterprize of the Duke of <hi>Sauoy,</hi> was by the practize and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of the League, which was that the armies of theſe two Dukes (of <hi>Sauoy</hi> and <hi>Maine)</hi> ſhould reſpectiuely fauour each other, each keeping his entent ſeuerall to himſelfe. For the Leaguers and the Duke of <hi>Sauoy</hi> did agree in this: to wit, in hating the true religion and the profeſſors thereof, and in making againſt them cruell warre, to roote them out, if they could doe it.</p>
               <p>But the particular thoughts of the partie were kept incommunicable within the heart of them, both of them reſeruing to themſelues, the meanes to worke their affayres, according to the opportunitie and occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

               <p>The Duke of <hi>Sauoy</hi> on the other ſide, thought himſelfe ſo well deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in blood, that he might claime to haue a good part, and thought it very conuenient for himſelfe to enlarge his dominions, and that being Sonne to a Daughter of <hi>France,</hi> he was nigh enough to poſſeſſe all, and would haue beene very ſory to haue had any companyon, either of the houſe of <hi>Guyze,</hi> or any other whatſoeuer.</p>
               <p>Theſe diuers drifts did lurke cloſe hidden in the hearts of both parts, being holpen and aduanced mutually by the common pretence which they tooke on both ſides, to wit, the rooting out of the reformed religion, which tearmed hereſie, and to that end, in open words they agreed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, did helpe and ayde each other, reſeruing to the craftieſt the beguy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of his felow, or to the ſtrongeſt to preuaile</p>

               <p>Whileſt the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> did holde the aſſembly of the reformed Churches at <hi>Rochel,</hi> as is aboue ſayd, and that the Duke of <hi>Sauoy</hi> inuaded the Marqueſdome of <hi>Saluce,</hi> the States did continue at <hi>Bloys</hi> with ſtrange miſtruſt, which did ſpring from hower to hower among the partakers.</p>
               <p>The pretence of Religion did continually rowle among the Leaguers and Leagued. Their liues and ſtate, ſayd they, did hang on a rotten threed.</p>
               <p>In December, two great alarums and pannick terrors were raiſed within the caſtell of <hi>Bloys,</hi> who did put the whole court in armor, and made them ſtand vpon their guardes. The cauſe of the firſt was a quarrell, which aroſe betweene the pages and lakeys, who did hold with the <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bons,</hi> and them which did hold with the League. The commotion and the feare was ſuch, that the Duke of <hi>Guyze</hi> tooke the alarum, ranne into his chamber, ſhut vp the dore, with Cofers, and other ſuch like things as were at hand.</p>
               <p>The ſecond alarum was geuen by a ſouldier hurt, which ſaued himſelfe in the chamber of the Duke of <hi>Guyze,</hi> into the which hee was purſued by ſome of the Kings guardes, who went vp with ſword in hand, whereupon once agayne all the court was in an vprore.</p>
               <p>About the ſame time alſo there were great enmities and ſeedes of quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels in the court (beſyde the vlcer of ambition &amp; deſire to raigne) betwéene the Lord of <hi>Guyze</hi> and many other Lordes of the court, by reaſon of loue: for as the Duke of <hi>Guyze</hi> in the middeſt of thoſe waighty matters which he went about to compaſſe, was greatly in loue with a Lady of the court: there were ſome Lords alſo who pretended the like affection to her, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were that they did ſo of purpoſe to pick a quarrell or otherwiſe, but ſo it was, that there paſſions of loue were openly perceaued.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Guyze</hi> about the middle of December, did ſhew himſelfe a more contemner of the Kinges authority, then euer he had done before: for
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:8966:158"/>
there was ſeene after him in great ſecurity following his trayne, and lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged euen in the Kings houſe, a great number of ruffiens and malefactors, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1588. Decemb."/> condemned in diuers places for diuers crymes, and executed in picture for contumacy: euen many of them which in Auguſt before had raiſed vp a ſedition in <hi>Engoleſme</hi> agaynſt the Lord <hi>Eſpernon,</hi> they were in ſuch ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity vnder his wing, that no magiſtrate durſt ſay any thing to them.</p>
               <p>The ſaid Duke alſo had ſhewed himſelfe more ſaucy and malapert in his words and behauiour, then euer hee did before. For the King hauing intercepted many of his letters, by the which hee did ſhew in open tearms the vilanous intent which he had purpoſed in his hart, called his Nobles, willed them to ſweare to him, that they would neuer conſent nor practiſe any thing agaynſt his perſon: he moſt arrogantly and contemptuouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed ſo to doo, euen in his preſence, ſaying, he will not do it, and if hee did it, there was good lawes to puniſh him: ſpare him not, let him bee puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed; bould and arrogant ſpeaches were geuen dayly by him, and his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Guyze</hi> conſidering, that by theſe freſh iniuries the King could not be much prouoked, calling to remembrance his former attempts, and that the ſtroke which he had long before intended, was made knowen to the King, began to enter a great fearfull apprehenſion, that the King would not delay his reuenge, but will goe about to preuent him. And now conſidering that all his partakers had bent their eyes vppon him, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected ſome great atchieuement, which ſhould farre exceed the former at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, ſeeing alſo how the K. of <hi>Nauarre</hi> by the edict of reunion, ſworne by the aſſembly of the States, was condemned and diſherited, &amp; that there was nothing left in the way to hinder him of his enterpriſe, and that hee himſelfe was now vpon the laſt ſtep of the ſtayrs, either to be King, or firſt commaunder vnder the name of King of <hi>France,</hi> ſo that nothing was wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, but either quite to diſpatch him, or elſe to take him priſoner. Hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued himſelf therefore to haſten one of theſe two executions, leaſt perhaps he might bee preuented, hee vndertooke himſelfe to do that feat, and layed that burthen vpon his ſhoulder. And that ſuch diſorder might bee done or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, he called the chiefeſt of the conſpiracy to counſell.</p>
               <p>The chiefeſt of this counſell and conſpiracy were Fryer <hi>Ladouik,</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall his brother, and Fryer <hi>I.</hi> Archebiſhop of <hi>Lyons,</hi> with few other, to whom he ſhewed in what ſtate his matters ſtood, and that all thinges are brought to ſome good effect, that nothing is obſtant to obtayne the thing ſo long, and ſo greatly deſired, but the perſon of the King: and that their counſels beeing come to light, hee was driuen to ſuch extremity, as that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ither he or the King muſt needes periſh.</p>
               <p>Hee propounded vnto them therefore, whether the King was to bee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched out of hand, or elſe to bee impriſoned till all thinges were confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:8966:159"/>
and eſtabliſhed for a new gouernment.</p>
               <p>They anſwere, that this matter is not to be delayed, but that the King <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1588. Decemb."/> was to be made away, and diſpatched out of hand: their reaſons be theſe, for (ſay they) fetters and priſons are altogether vnprofitable, that no dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon (how deepe ſoeuer) could be able to keep cloſe ſo great and mighty a Potentate, and that ſo long as he ſhould liue hee would cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>If hee were kept in priſon, it would ſeeme cruell and ſtrange to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people, and intollerable. That they of late (after the Kings fleeing from <hi>Paris)</hi> had found and learned by experience, that pitty preuaileth more then fauour.</p>
               <p>But aſſoone as he ſhould be diſpatched, new deuiſes ſhould bee practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, new counſels taken, and that euery man would fall againe rather to their priuate, preſent, and ſure commodities, then to attempt dangerous enterpriſes.</p>
               <p>Grounded vpon theſe reaſons, the ſeruants do determin vpon the death of their Lord, the anoynted of the Lord, and a man reuerenced of ſo many Nations, is condemned to die by the bloudy ſwordes of them, who might haue ſaid, that whatſoeuer they haue beſydes their béeing, they haue it of him and his predeceſſors liberality, whoſe Grandfather came to begge to the dore of his aunceſtors. Riſe vp O Lord, defend thyne Ordinance, and the powers which thou haſt appointed.</p>
               <p>The 24. day of December is appointed for that cruell execution: their deſperat parricide is ſealed with an oth, ſo they depart.</p>
               <p>The King ignorant of this ſentence of condemnation geuen againſt him, yet prouoked both by the old and new iniuries, proffered him daily by the Duke of <hi>Guyze,</hi> did meditate how, and watched for the opportunity, as by one blow to rid himſelfe out of that danger and feare wherein he ſaw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: and perceauing well by the partialities and partaking of (in a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner) the whole aſſembly of the States, and that contrary vnto his expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: (for he thought by the conſent of the States to haue conuicted, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, and executed both the Duke and few of the chiefeſt of his parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers) he was in danger that which he pretended would be wrought againſt him either directly, or vndirectly by the ſayd eſtates, determined to follow an extraordinarie way, and to preuent his enemy, knowing the Prouerbe to bee true, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: and knowing the cauſe ſo to do to be lawfull, thought the courſe taken for the execution, would be diuerſly iudged: yet hee thought to follow a iuſt cauſe ſome what vnlawfull (neceſſity enforcing him ſo to doo) might be well interpreted in a man of his degree and calling: he pronounceth therfore ſentence of death againſt the Duke of <hi>Guyze,</hi> and few others.</p>
               <p>Here Chriſtian Reader, thou ſeeſt the ſubiect and ſeruant to haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned

               <p>Marke alſo Gods iuſtice vpon carnall men deſtitute of the right know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, fellowes in a manner and companions of one affection, of one minde, of one conſent, in perſecuting the Sonne of God, in deuouring the innocent, as if they would eate bread: the Lord ſent euill Angels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them to ſcatter them, their counſels and power; the one is poſſeſſed with an vncleane ſpirit of ambition; the other (bewitched with a ſpirit of hatred againſt the trueth of God) is made ſecure and flacke to preuent the euill betunes, vntill he is enforced to followe that courſe, which common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men will condemne vpon his companion, his friend and familiar, who went into the Temples of their Gods to take ſweete counſell together. O the depth of Gods iudgments, how deepe and vnſearchable be they:</p>
               <p>The Kings counſell and determination could not be kept ſo ſecret, the King hauing ſo many Leaguers about him to ſmell his breath, but the 22 of December, as the Duke of <hi>Guize</hi> had ſet downe to dinner, he found vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his napkin a little bill, wherein was written that he ſhould take héede, for they will play a ſhrewd play with him. In the ſame bill he wrote with his owne hand a mocking anſwere thus. They dare not, and ſo caſt it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the table.</p>
               <p>The Leaguers neither could not keepe their breath ſo warily, but that their determination tooke flight abroad. For the ſame day the King recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued diuers aduertiſements of this perilous conſpiracie, and determination of the Duke of <hi>Guize</hi> againſt his perſon. But ſpecially y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Duke <hi>de Mayne</hi> brother to the Duke of <hi>Guize,</hi> ſent <hi>Alphonſe Corſe</hi> expreſſedly to the K. to aduertiſe him to take heed of the Duke of <hi>Guize</hi> his brother: it was an eaſie thing (ſayd he) to carrie a rope of Beades about his necke, but for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine hee knewe very well that his brother had a ſhrewd enterpriſe in hand againſt him. He knewe not when the execution would be, but he knew ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well that it would be ſhortly, and that he was in doubt leaſt this war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſhould come too late: and warned him in theſe words, that his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie ſhould beware of a furious and deſperate minde.</p>
               <p>The Duke <hi>Aumale</hi> likewiſe ſent his wife to <hi>Bloys</hi> to the King, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſe him of the ſame daunger and conſpiracie againſt him, and that the conſpirators were vpon the poynt of the execution.</p>
               <p>Alſo one of the conſpirators themſelues mooued in conſcience, diſcloſed vnto him the whole conſpiracie, the day appoynted, the tokens &amp; the names
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:8966:160"/>
of the conſpirators, but in ſuch a ſhort time, that the King had ſcarſe oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie and time to eſcape and preuent that imminent danger. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1588. Decemb."/>
               </p>
               <p>The King alſo had intercepted not long before many letters, wherein in plaine tearmes the Leaguers had vttered their determination.</p>
               <p>The King hauing receaued ſo many meſſengers of death, and reduced to this extremitie, doth perceiue that he is beaten with his owne rod. For calling to remembrance the great iniuries which hee and his brethren had receaued of that houſe euen from their infancie, acknowledging now that all the former troubles (as hee confeſſeth in a certaine letter of his to the Lord <hi>Tageus)</hi> in his Realme, haue béen by their practiſes and procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: how that hee hath ſeene all the euident tokens of their aſpyring to his eſtate, their clayming of the Crowne by their fayned geuealogies, ſet foorth in the ſight of the world. He remembreth alſo the decay of his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie among all his ſubiects, to haue béen their worke, by the diffamatorie Libels diſperſed abroade, with diuers ſlaunders and calumnies. He ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth the practiſing of the deliberation of <hi>Rome,</hi> about the rooting out or diſheriting the royall bloud in <hi>France</hi> in the houſes of <hi>Valoys</hi> and <hi>Bourbons,</hi> to ſet vp the houſe of <hi>Lorreyne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Among other things, he reckoneth the ſeditious preachers, as Ieſuites, and other vncleane foules of that colour, hired by them of <hi>Guize,</hi> and <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reyne,</hi> to ſtirre vp ſedition, and ſteale away the people from his obedience, thereby to ſtrengthen their partes. He calleth to remembrance, the taking vp of armes againſt his will, in the yeare 1585. the raiſing vp of the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult in <hi>Paris</hi> againſt his owne perſon, the letters of <hi>Guize</hi> intercepted, wherein he diſcouereth his minde ſo deepely, that thereby he might ſee eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry veine and hole in their braine and hearts: the ſaucie parts, and manifeſt attempts, which both hee, and his partakers had vſed toward him in his owne preſence, both in words and behauiour, the conſideration alſo of theſe aduertiſements from ſo many parts, did cauſe great paſſions in his minde. But did not conſider from whence theſe blowes did come, neither from whence his ſlacknes, in repreſſing and puniſhing by time thoſe offences.</p>
               <p>Specially, when remembring the fauours that hee and his predeceſſors had giuen to that famely: but he aboue all, had more eſteemed them, then the Princes of his bloud, had made him his fellow and companion, in all the exploytes done againſt them of the reformed religion, whome hee had fauored with diuers great dignities, pardoned him of ſo many grieuous of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, which he would not haue forgiuen to his owne brother: to be ſhort, he loued and imbraced him, as his own ſoule: this incredible vnthankfulnes and treacherie, did moue him to great indignation.

               <p>And namely, when he conſidered how halfe a yeare before, when he was in a manner diſpoſſeſſed of his kingdome &amp; Authority, after his flight from <hi>Paris,</hi> how his faithfull ſubiects, of all callings and degrees, reſorted vnto them, both to ſhew him the vnſufferable indignities, which he had receaued of that houſe, and alſo to proffer him their ſeruice and aſſiſtance. When hee called to minde, how often and how faithfully, the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> had proffered him his forces, and that in ſuch ſort, that if it had pleaſed him but to holde vp his hand onely, and let him alone with them, he with his owne forces and charges, would ſet him at hearts eaſe from any danger or ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The King in this agony and heauy ſighes, not conſidering the cauſes of theſe blowes and terrors of death, full of ſorrowes and indignation, dooth determine with himſelfe as well as hee can, to preuent the treaſons of his domeſticall enemies in this wiſe.</p>

               <p>He had beene perſwaded long before, that the Lorde <hi>Loignak</hi> had vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken to kill him, ſo that of all other he hated him moſt, and miſtruſted him greatly, and entering into the kings chamber, he ſaw the ſame Lord <hi>Loignak</hi> ſitting vpon a coffer, hauing his armes a croſſe, and ſuppoſing that he ſtayed there to ſet vpon him (for he ſhewed that hee was touched with a violent apprehenſion of miſtruſt) although the ſaid L. <hi>Loignak</hi> did not ſtir: yet the Lord <hi>Guize</hi> notwithſtanding did ſet vpon him, &amp; ſetting his hand to his ſword did draw it halfe, for he had his cloake (as common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he was wont to haue) in ſcar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>It could not be done without ſome rumor, which was heard out of the counſell chamber: whereupon the Cardinall his brother entred into miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt, and conceauing a great feare, made haſte to get out: but he met one of the ſkottiſh guardes who had charge to arreſt him.</p>
               <p>He tooke that arreſt very ſtraunge, and made ſhew to reſiſt: but ſeeing the rumor and daunger, hee ceaſed from his reſiſtaunce and yeelded.</p>
               <p>The Archbiſhop of <hi>Lyons</hi> at this alarum, went forth furiouſly, and would know more, and as he ſaid, would ſuccour the Duke of <hi>Guyze,</hi> but he was arreſted by ſome of the guardes, and his fury was ſo cooled, that from a woolfe, he was turned into the forme of a lambe, yet retayning ſtill wooluiſh conditions: ſo theſe two Fryers (the deuills ghoſtly fathers) remayned both priſoners.</p>
               <p>The graund Pryor was gone very early to awake the Lord <hi>Ianuile,</hi> to to play the match which they had made the day before, and found him in his bed: and after he had made himſelf quickly ready (but whether it were that he ſaw the graund Pryor followed incontinently with ſome of the guardes, or ſome other matter) hee began ſodaynly to miſtruſt, and went about to ſlip into a doore of his chamber, and to make ſome reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:8966:162"/>
ſeeking to get forth with his ſworde in hand againſt ſome of the guarde: but conſidering the danger he yeelded him ſelfe to the ſayd guard. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1588.

               <p>At the ſame inſtant one <hi>Pellicart,</hi> ſecretary vnto the Duke of <hi>Guyze</hi> was taken, with al his papers &amp; writings, by the which many ſecret coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of the ſayd <hi>Guize</hi> were diſcouered to the King, with the names of the chiefeſt of the League, as wel of the princes and Nobles, as of the prieſts and townes.</p>
               <p>The king of the Fryers, to wit, the Cardinall of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> who was at bed, was deſired by a captayne of the guarde to riſe, and ſo was his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon made ſure.</p>
               <p>The Marqueſſe <hi>d' Albeuf</hi> likewiſe, and many other of the partakers of the Lord of <hi>Guize</hi> were taken, and put in places of ſafety.</p>
               <p>That day the king made a fayre hande, for he caught a number of cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell beaſts and vncleane foules, as Woolues, Foxes, ſwine, wilde Boars, Apes, and ſuch like.</p>
               <p>But the looſing of ſome of them afterward, was the cauſe of his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dooing and death.

And foraſmuch as the loue which the ſaid Duke of <hi>Guize</hi> had borne vnto him, might happily make him to be ſuſpected by the king, he yeelded himſelfe willingly into the hands of the ſayd Duke of <hi>Neuers</hi> for to iuſtifie his actions.</p>
               <p>Afterward the Gentleman went from the king to the ſayd Duke of <hi>Neuers,</hi> who informed him of all that which is aboue ſayd, and within a while after the Lord <hi>Chaſtre</hi> went to the king.</p>
               <p>The King had ſome ſpeeches with the ſayd Lorde <hi>Chaſtre</hi> of all that had paſſed touching the particular of him: the Lord <hi>Chaſtre</hi> of long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance,

which hee woulde forget, and vppon the promiſe which the ſaide <hi>Chaſtre</hi> made, to remaine his faithfull ſeruant, commaunded him to make <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1588.

               <p>A little while after the death of the <hi>Guize,</hi> the King went to ſee the Queene his mother, and ſhewed her what was done that morning, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of at the firſt ſhe was greatly moued: yet remembring the iuſt occaſions which the ſaid Duke of <hi>Guize</hi> had giuen him to ſeeke reuenge, ſhee prayed God that it might bee well done: and willed the King to aduertiſe the Popes Legat, that which was done. For a while after, the King ſent the Cardinall <hi>Gundy,</hi> to ſhew to the ſaide Legat, the attempt of the Duke of <hi>Guize,</hi> againſt his perſon and eſtate; which thing had enforced him to doo that execution: he ſhewed that in it, he had followd the Popes his maſters counſell, who aduiſed him ſo to doo, if by no other meanes he could auoyde ſuch enterpriſes. Where it is ſaide, that the King dooth aleage to the Popes Legat, his maſters counſell and conſent, the matter goeth as the common report gooth.</p>
               <p>It is moſt certaine, that Frier <hi>Sixtus,</hi> and his Chaplines, with his predeceſſors before him had been, and were then the chiefeſt authors, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters on, and maintainers of the League in <hi>France,</hi> and that by all meanes, ſo that it were not with money, (for to meddle with the purſes of theſe ghoſtly fathers is ſacriledge, and to tirannize the holy Church) did fauour, foſter, and further all the felouies, trecheries, and treaſons of the Duke of <hi>Guize.</hi> The King hauing a perfect knowledge of theſe their dooings, yet by policy he obtained Frier <hi>Sixtus,</hi> and his Prieſts, both his conſent and hands, to iuſtifie his actions, which he entended to bring to paſſe vpon the perſons of the Duke of <hi>Guize,</hi> and others his adherents: if the Pope, after the fact; if <hi>Soltan Solyman,</hi> out of the capitall of <hi>Rome,</hi> would thunder his vaine boults, not excommunication, but of proſcription, which this Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt moſt arrogantly doo vſurp vpon Princes.</p>
               <p>He wrote therefore to Frier <hi>Sixtus,</hi> that he had a number of rebels of all degrees, as well of the nobilitie as of others, who had conſpired againſt his life and ſtate, whether that hee might make ſuch a ſlaughter of them, by ſurpriſe, as hee made at Saint <hi>Bartholmew,</hi> in the yeare 1571. and kill them by all meanes poſſible, ſeeing that he could not follow againſt them any extraordinarie courſe. Frier <hi>Sixtus</hi> and his harpies about him, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that the King by rebels, vnderſtood the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> and others of the nobles with him, and of other degrees, and that he had ſo fetcht in his head, whereby he hoped to drawe them into his ſnare, were as ready to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther him to that exployte, as the King was ready to doo it. Frier <hi>Sixtus</hi> anſwered in his name, and of his Ianiſſaries, that hee might deſtroy them

by all meanes poſſible: for in extraordinarie dangers, extraordinarie courſe might be taken. This is that which he al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>The Legat vpon this newes, was wonderfully amazed, for beſide that, hee feared his owne ſkin, hee had alſo aſſured all <hi>Italy</hi> of cleane contrary e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uents, then thoſe which he ſaw to haue fallen out.</p>
               <p>The ſame day, the Legat was prayed to make interceſſion with the King, for the Cardinall of <hi>Guize;</hi> which thing hee promiſed to doo. Men cannot by any meanes prolong the time of their ende: many haue thought that the ſauing of the life of the Cardinall of <hi>Guize,</hi> might haue been eaſily obtained. But as a haughtie courage, which thinketh to bee nigh to ſome great and extraordinary proſperous fortune, cannot eaſily quiet himſelfe, when he ſeeth himſelfe debaſed, and carried away farre from his expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. So this man fallen from ſo high, and moued with his domeſticall loſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, could not quiet himſelfe, but by hot words hee threatned, to performe more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euer his brother entended, whoſe chiefeſt ſetter on he was. This his raging minde, wrapped him in the ſelfe ſame puniſhment with his Brother, being founde and iudged culpable of the ſelfe ſame crime of treaſon.</p>
               <p>Here marke Chriſtian reader, a notable example of Gods iuſtice: for the King would eaſily haue pardoned him, and ſpared his life, but Gods iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice bringing him to iudgement, forſooke him in the perturbation of his heart, to prouoke his Soueraigne King, whome hee had offended in the higheſt degree, againſt his will, to make him drinke of the cup of Gods wrath.</p>
               <p>So that the King ſeeing his threatnings, which diſcouered plainly the damnable thoughts of his heart, cauſed him the ſame day to bee ſtrangled, as it is reported, with a tippet of ſilke, which he was wont to weare about his neck, to put a difference between him and the common ſort of traitors: for they are ſtrangled with ropes of hempe, but this traiterens Frier was choaked with a holy tippet of ſilke, in the ſelfe ſame place where he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted priſoner. Theſe executions being done vpon the conſpiratours, the King went to goe to Maſſe into the temple of Saint <hi>Sauiour,</hi> which is in the court of the Caſtell. There the Popes Legat did walke and talke long with the King, ſometime ſmiling in the ſight of a great number of people, which did marke it. Among whom, many ſeeing the ioyfull countenance of the Legat, thought that hee was not greatly ſory for that which had paſſed there that morning, although that his great familiarity with the houſe of <hi>Guize,</hi> would haue giuen occaſion to expect of him the contrarie. But all that was but to make faire weather, which the King fearing himſelfe, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the heate of the Kings reuenge, to haue ſuſtained the ſame puniſhment with his companions, which he had no leſſe deſerued then they had.</p>
               <p>

Now we haue to ſpeake ſomewhat of the conſpirators, who were of fiue ſorts. In the euening, all things were as quiet at <hi>Bloys,</hi> as they had béen <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1588.

               <p>
                  <hi>Briſſak</hi> and others, to mollifie the Kings diſpleaſure, which they ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the guiltines of their conſciences, the King to haue conceaued of them, that in time they might eſcape out of his clawes, made an oration gratulatory for his good ſucceſſe, in eſcaping that conſpiracy, but ſpecially did clawe him in that place, where he did moſt itch, to wit, exhorted him to continue the warre againſt them of the reformed religion, vſing great outragious wordes and inuectiues, leauing them no hope of merrie.</p>
               <p>This oration was followed of many ſuch others, not for loue to the K. but for three ſpeciall cauſes. Firſt, that with ſuch holy water the King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing blinded, they might flye out of his hand. Secondly, that by ſetting the King agaynſt the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> and the heretikes (as they tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med them) hee ſhould haue his forces ſcattered, and his perſon beeing the weaker by it, they might at ſome opportunity ſurpriſe him. Thirdly, they feared leaſt he would vpon this occaſion ioyne the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> and ſo to haue béene able to take reuenge vpon all the ſort of the conſpiratours: therefore they thought good to blow the coales to let all reconſiliation.</p>
               <p>The ſame day the King ſent to the aſſembly of the ſtates, to let them vnderſtand that it was his pleaſure, that the ſtates ſhould continue with a full determination to follow their reaſonable counſels in all things.</p>
               <p>The 24. of December, the King diſpatched diuers meſſengers into dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers Prouinces with theſe inſtructions following.</p>
               <p>The firſt troubles raiſed vp by the Lord of <hi>Guyze</hi> in this realme, in the yere 1585. haue ſhewed ſufficiently an other meaning in him, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the zeale of the Catholike Religion, wherewith he hath couered his actions, to abuſe them, who are more ready to embrace nouelties, then wiſe to conſider the euents.</p>
               <p>For hauing couered his entents with the cloake of the catholik religion, and the rooting out of hereſy, all his exploits haue béen executed in the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholik townes, and in the beſt, which he could ſeaze vpon, to lay downe a ſtedfaſt foundation of the drifts long before notoriouſly forecaſt for the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The King ſheweth that by the meanes of the riſing of the ſayd Duke, he was enforced to let him haue the beſt part of his forces and meanes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he hath not béene able to oppoſe himſelfe to them of the religion, as he was willing to doo: whereby hereſy (ſayth he) hath taken deeper root in the Realme then euer it had before.</p>
               <p>He ſheweth, that while his forces were occupyed againſt the heretikes in <hi>Guyen, Prouance,</hi> and <hi>Daulphine,</hi> he and his partakers haue practiſed to

withdraw all that euer they could from his obedience.</p>
               <p>He ſayth alſo, that notwithſtanding the ſeditious ſeazing of <hi>Paris</hi> by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the League, yet he was deſyrous to forget all offences paſſed: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1588.

               <p>He aduertiſeth them, that the ambition of the ſayd Duke of <hi>Guyze,</hi> was growen to that contempt of his eſtate, that hee would no more depend of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other: and that in ſtead of thankes, to acknowledge theſe fauours, hee had vſed them to his further enterpriſes.</p>

               <p>He and his did braue, threaten, and put in feare, them which would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne ſeruants vnto their King, to make them to forſake him, that ſo he might the more eaſily oppreſſe him.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Guyze</hi> by his partakers, had practiſed the Prouinces by his factions to render his authority, hatefull to his Subiectes, ſuborning them to make vnciuill requeſtes, that in obtayning them, they might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſe his authority, and in refuſing them (which he will perſwade the King to do) hee might make him hatefull to his ſubiectes.</p>
               <p>The King had vſed all the prudence that euer he could deuiſe, vntill he perceaued himſelf to be fallen into the contempt of his ſubiects, which was a way to performe the blow long before hand entended.</p>
               <p>Beſides, he ſheweth, how hee hath had diuers aduertiſements euen by the next vnto the Duke of <hi>Guyze</hi> to beware of him, by whom he was in danger to looſe both his life and crowne.</p>
               <p>Hee notifyeth to them, that conſidering the euill could not be auoyded, but by the death of the author: he was enforced to ſaue himſelfe by ſlaying the ſayd Duke of <hi>Guyze,</hi> the 23. of December.</p>
               <p>To preuent therefore all falſe reportes, hee was willing to let them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the truth of the matter, that all occaſion of tumult (which might ariſe by falſe reportes) might be taken away.</p>
               <p>He certifyeth his Subiects that he intendeth to follow the warre, for the extirpation of hereſy, and the mayntaining of the Romiſh religion.</p>
               <p>Hee ſayth alſo that he declareth to them, that he will haue his ſubiectes eaſed as much as ſhall bee poſſible, and that he hath ſent word vnto the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties aſſembled in the Towne of <hi>Bloys,</hi> that he would haue the ſtates en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with all liberty.</p>
               <p>He warneth them alſo, that he will haue no partialities, leagues, aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:8966:164"/>
nor intelligences among his ſubiects, and that they ſhall not here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after acknowledge any other then him, who is their King ordayned of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1588. Decemb."/> God.</p>
               <p>He certifyeth them alſo, that he will ſuffer no longer the contempt of his authority, but will chaſtize them who ſhall offend in that behalfe.</p>
               <p>Theſe informations were ſent by the King into the Prouinces to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernors and Magiſtrates, to geue notice of the ſame to the people, leaſt by falſe rumors, they ſhould haue béen ſtirred vp to rebellion by the Leaguers, who were diſperſed in all partes of the realme.

               <p>Within few daies after theſe things ſo paſſed at <hi>Bloys,</hi> the <hi>Q Mother</hi> dyed, who there had fallen ſicke vppon the firſt aſſembling of the ſtates: ſhe had liued a long age (and too long for <hi>France,</hi> if it had beene Gods will that it ſhould haue béene otherwiſe) for ſhe hath beene the cheefeſt worker of all the great miſeryes, and lamentable alterations which haue happened in <hi>France:</hi> hauing bewitched with her Sorceryes (as an other <hi>Circe</hi> hir countrey woman) her owne Children, and many Princes and Nobles of <hi>France,</hi> whom ſhe tranſformed not in outward forme, but in conditions and qualityes of Tygers, Wolues, Foxes, Swine, and all maner of cruell beaſtes, and vncleane fowles, euen a number tranſformed into the nature of vncleane ſpirits and deuils. She neuer ceaſed from her enchantments, vntill by Gods iuſt iudgement ſhe had deſtroied her owne children, houſe &amp; family. To be ſhort, ſhe was a woman of a baſe birth and ability, bold to worke all iniquity and vnrighteouſnes.</p>
               <p>Now wee haue to deſcrybe the conſpiratours, and how they ſhifted for themſelues.</p>
               <p>The three greateſt domeſticall enemies that euer <hi>France</hi> or any King had in his boſome, were the Duke of <hi>Guize,</hi> the Cardinall his brother, and the <hi>Q Mother,</hi> they three are ſmitten downe by the finger of God, as if it had béen with a thunderboult.</p>
               <p>The ſecond ſort of the conſpirators (moſt dangerous and cruell beaſts) were in hold, as the Cardinall of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> the Marquis <hi>Albeuf,</hi> the <hi>Guizes</hi> ſonne, and Frier Archbiſhop of <hi>Lions,</hi> as is before ſaid, and more the King might haue caught: and if the King had béen a carefull reuenger of Gods lawe, and had feared God more then man, they had drunke of the dregges of Gods iuſtice as their fellowes did.</p>
               <p>The third ſort of conſpirators were in the Kings ſight, and within the Towne, as <hi>Chaſtre, Briſſak, Boyſdaulphin,</hi> and others, to whom hée for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaue the due puniſhment: and they did ſpeake him fayre for a while, vntill they ſawe an occaſion to worke him miſchiefe, as the ſequell did verifie.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="316" facs="tcp:8966:165"/>
The fourth ſort of the traytors were, ſome in the Towne, and many in the Suburbs, there lurking vntill the Duke of <hi>Guize</hi> would haue giuen <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1588 Decemb."/> the watch word, readie to execute or to helpe him in the execution of his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe, there notwithſtanding the ſhutting of the gates, either through the teſtimonie and guiltines of their conſciences, or that the rumour that was ſpread, flying ouer the wall gaue them the alarum; ſo that they of the reformed religion did neuer depart out of S. <hi>Germayne</hi> ſuburbe on <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholmew</hi> day in the yeare 1572. as theſe fellowes departed out of <hi>Bloys</hi> without boates or other furniture.</p>
               <p>Theſe moſt damnable traytors carrying abroade the rumours of the Duke of <hi>Guize,</hi> with amplification, and with deprauing of the Kings fact, did begin and aduaunce the rebellion, which anſwered afterward agaynſt the King.</p>
               <p>The fift ſort was of them, who the day before tooke it to bee a poynt of honour wherupon to challenge to the combat, if any man had called them Royals: now they on a ſudden did hate outwardly worſe then murther to bee called Guiziens: of this ſort were the moſt part of the Prieſtes and Commons there aſſembled at the States, who by little and little ſlyding away one after another, cauſed through the moſt part of thoſe Prouinces which had rooted out the Goſpell from among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, an vniuerſall rebellion.</p>
               <p>The King forgetting his calling, to wit, to bee a publike reuenger of Gods lawe, and executer of his iuſtice, who commandeth him that his eye ſhall not take pitie vpon ſuch abominable contemners of Gods ordinance and iuſtice, whoſe Image his perſon repreſented, fearing men more then GOD, and vnder the colour of clemencie conſented to their crimes, and through impunitie approoued their miſdéedes; God a righteous Iudge turned this his puſillanimitie to a ſnare and a blocke of offence, by the which he wrought his owne ouerthrowe and miſerable end.</p>
               <p>Now leauing the euents which followed this tragedie played at <hi>Bloys,</hi> we will fetch other matters and exploits which were done in other places, that varietie may not onely delight the Chriſtian Reader, but alſo ſtirre him vp to feare, tremble, and reuerence Gods iudgements. For not onely at <hi>Bloys</hi> he powred mightie ſtreames of his wrath vpon the wicked, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in other places the Lord at the ſame time fed his enemies with ſhame, clothed them with diſhonour, and rewarded them with confuſion, and in all places deliuered his Saints.</p>
               <p>It is ſayd before, how at the making and concluding of the edict of reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in Iuly laſt, it was agreed that two mightie Armies ſhould be muſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and made vp with as much readines as it could be done: the one ſhould be conducted by the Duke of <hi>Guize</hi> into <hi>Guienne;</hi> and the other vnder the leading of the Duke <hi>de Mayne</hi> into <hi>Daulphine,</hi> there to roote out them of the religion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="317" facs="tcp:8966:165"/>
But yet the Duke of <hi>Guize</hi> aduiſed by his counſell, to wit, the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall his brother, and the Biſhop of <hi>Lions,</hi> altered his purpoſe for three cauſes. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1588. Decemb."/>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, the cauſe of religion which he pretended, was not the marke that he ſhot at, neither did he greatly care which of the two went backward or forward.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he perceaued how he went to caſt himſelfe into the hazard of warre, which is vncertaine, but ſpecially agaynſt ſuch a Captayne who he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto had remained inuincible, and knewe with fewe how to ouercome great multitudes and mighty forces, whom hee feared as the ſlaue doth dread his Lord, whom he hath greeuouſly offended. Therfore he thought good not to hazard that way, but to reſerue himſelfe to a better opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, which would be offered him ere long.</p>
               <p>The third cauſe was, that if he ſhould abſent himſelfe farre from <hi>Paris</hi> it might be that the King would enterpriſe it there uppon, and carry it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from him. Alſo, if he ſhould abſent himſelfe from the Court, he were not able eaſily to bring to paſſe his intent, nor giue the blowe which he had in minde long before.</p>
               <p>Therfore another is to be ſent, yet it muſt not be any ſuſpected perſon. As for the Princes they are partiall in this cauſe, and being of great au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of themſelues, are not to bee armed with power, for els they may marre the play.</p>
               <p>The Marſhals <hi>Byron</hi> and <hi>Haultmont</hi> are good noble men, good French men and valiant, they are Royals, and therfore we will haue none of them. For it were not good to arme them with ſuch forces: for if wee ſay they ſhould in the meane time execute our enterpriſe, whileſt they had ſuch an armie they might marre all, and begin a new tragedie vpon the players of the former.</p>
               <p>Therefore ſuch a Generall muſt néedes bee appoynted, as may flatter with both ſides, and that will turne to the ſtrongeſt part, and if he ſhould be loſt in the battell it maketh no matter who that ſhould be. The Duke of <hi>Neuers,</hi> of Nation an Italian, an Atheiſt by religion, a Spanyard by faction; a Leaguer and a Royall both, by policie and diſſimulation; in No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie <hi>nouus homo.</hi> For here is to be noted, that in Italy there is no ancient Nobilitie remayning, except it bee the <hi>Vrſins</hi> and <hi>Colomuae,</hi> and ſome of the <hi>Patrilij</hi> in <hi>Venice.</hi> For all the reſt (perhaps ſome fewe excepted) are fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies raiſed vp within theſe few hundred yeares, out of Colliers, as the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicis,</hi> Porters and Chimney ſweepers, during the vniuerſall rebellion of <hi>Italy</hi> againſt the Emperours, vnder the factions of <hi>Guelpſes</hi> and <hi>Gibelius:</hi> and the Popes baſtards alſo are the ſtockes of many families, which now are accounted of the chiefeſt Nobilitie there, as the houſes of <hi>Parma, Vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

This Duke of <hi>Neuers</hi> hanging about the ſkirts of the <hi>Q.

               <p>The noble Princes of the royall blood, the ancient Nobility of <hi>France</hi> are no men, but ſet behinde the doore; they may not lead the kings armies, not for lack of ſufficiencie: Why then: Becauſe they are ſuſpected by the League, to be true to their king, good louers of their country, and too na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall to their kings ſubiects and fellow Citizens.</p>
               <p>Whileſt therefore the States doe continue at <hi>Bloys</hi> and <hi>Rochel,</hi> the Kings armie in Nouember taking their iourney into <hi>Poytow,</hi> with great preparatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, intending as wel to recouer the places occupied by them of the Religion, as alſo to beat the king of <hi>Nauarre;</hi> in which doing not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they ſhould make an ende of the warre by rooting out vtterly them of the Religion, but alſo ſhould recouer the loſſe of the honour of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, which a moneth before had beene buried at <hi>Coutras</hi> by the King of <hi>Nauarre.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This armie was great and ſtrong, conſiſting of Frenchmen, Swiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers, and Italians, hauing a great number of armed men. And as it mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched forward, ſo ſtill it increaſed. For light horſes and Noble men, with other qualities out of all partes, out of the cities and communalties of the Prouinces neere about, as well of the one as of the other ſide of the <hi>Loyre,</hi> did voluntarylie ioyne themſelues to it. And among others out of the low <hi>Poytow,</hi> were the Lords of <hi>Roches, Beatault</hi> of <hi>Bourneueau, Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherie,</hi> and Saint <hi>Andre,</hi> with their companies.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Neuers,</hi> as is ſayd before, was generall, aſſiſted with the Lord <hi>Chaſtre</hi> and <hi>Sagonne,</hi> two notable traytors Leaguers, and <hi>Lauer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine,</hi> loyall and faithfull to his Prince, with other Lords and Captaines, Ordinance, munition, and all kinde of preparation of warre was great. The greateſt part of this armie as well of the heads and commaunders, as of the Nobilitie and others which did obey, were Leaguers and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued, who thought that they could neuer worke miſchiefe enough.</p>
               <p>It is an incredible thing to heare the miſchieues, hauock, and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which this armie did where it paſſed through, but ſpecially to them of the reformed religion, who were found before them, both in their houſes and abroad: the people, men and women, euen in diuers places the very cattell did flie before this armie, as before a thundering tempeſt, euen as a flock of ſheepe before a heard of woolues, ſauage beaſts, or monſters ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſeene before.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Rochel,</hi> and other townes of ſafetie, round about were quickly repleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed of exiled people out of <hi>Poytow, Britaine, Touraine, Landomoys,</hi> and other places nigh the ſoiourning of this armie: Euen many Catholickes fled into the townes of the reformed religion, abhorring, accurſing, &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting thoſe miſbegotten monſters.</p>
               <p>The firſt place where this flood ſpewed out of the Dragons mouth to haue drowned the woman which was in trauaile, I meane this army was ſtayed, was before <hi>Mauleon,</hi> which is a ſmall towne, feeble, and of no ſtrength at all. There is in the ſame a Caſtell, which is of no better de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence than the towne.</p>
               <p>The king of <hi>Nauarre</hi> (as it is ſayd) after the taking of <hi>Beauuoyre,</hi> leſt within the ſame towne, the Lord <hi>Viliers Charlemaigne</hi> for gouernour, with a certaine number of Souldiers, not for to obſtinate themſelues vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that naughty place (which was not able to reſiſt a farre leſſer than a royall armie) but for to keepe the field, and for to refreſh himſelfe. The armie deſcending from <hi>Turenne</hi> tooke way to <hi>Mauleon,</hi> about the 13, of Nouember.</p>
               <p>The forerunners of the armie ſhewed themſelues: the gariſon there would not diſlodge for them, but made a ſhew as though they would hold the place. But forces arriuing more and more vnlooked for, at length the Ordinance was brought before the place. The Lord <hi>Viliers</hi> ſeeing that, determined to capitulate by the meanes of the Lord <hi>Lauerdine,</hi> the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne, and one <hi>Croix</hi> were appoynted to conclude the capitulation.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Miraumont</hi> Sargeant maior of the battell, was ſent for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtage to <hi>Mauleon</hi> for ſafety. From <hi>Mauleon</hi> went forth alſo for hoſtage Captayne <hi>Laudebrix.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The agreement was made and concluded with ſmall aduantage to them who were beſieged within the towne: for the Lords <hi>Brigneulx,</hi> and <hi>Chaſtiagueray</hi> did draw nigh the walles of the Town, which were already forſaken by the garriſon, and not defended: and after they had pulled down few ſtones by ſurpriſing, and contrary vnto the agreement, entred into the towne, did kill and wound all them whom they found both of the garriſon, and alſo of their owne ſide; notwithſtanding the reſiſtance and reproofe which the ſayd Lord <hi>Miraumont</hi> could do, for to let ſuch a treacherous vnfaithfulnes vnworthy of men of warre.</p>
               <p>The paſſion of theſe leagued Souldiers was ſhewed ſo diſordered and barbarous, that they compelled the ſayd Lord <hi>Miraumont</hi> to ſaue himſelfe into the caſtell, with the remainant of the garriſon which had eſcaped, for many had béene moſt vilanouſly ſlaine after they had yeelded their armor,
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:8966:167"/>
ſome did ſaue themſelues by flight, caſting themſelues ouer the wall; other were hurt; ſome taken and ſpoyled of all that euer they had, contrary to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1588. Nouemb."/> agreement.</p>
               <p>The Lords <hi>Chaſtre</hi> and <hi>Lauerdine,</hi> aduertiſed of this diſorder, haſted thether, and cauſed (although very late) the killing to ceaſe, and conducted the reſt of them who had eſcaped, beyond the riuer <hi>Seure,</hi> toward <hi>Fonteney.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After this exploit done, the army marched ſtraight way toward the Towne and Caſtell of <hi>Montagne,</hi> at the ſolicitation of them of <hi>Nantes,</hi> and Nobility of <hi>Aniou,</hi> and low <hi>Poytow,</hi> who were not of the religion, who altogether receaued by it many diſcommodities: the moſt part of Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men hauing retyred, ſome to <hi>Nantes</hi> and ſome to <hi>Angers:</hi> and they all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to haue that thorne out of their heele.

               <p>This towne and caſtle of <hi>Montagne</hi> pertained to the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> which by the outrages of ſome of the countrey and neighbours had béen ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed, and the walles ſo beaten downe, that there was no hope left that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny warre could be made there. Notwithſtanding, the Lord <hi>Colombieres</hi> whom wee haue ſaid to haue brought certaine companies vnto the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> out of <hi>Normandy,</hi> with his yongeſt ſonne called <hi>Lucerne,</hi> &amp; ſome companies with them had ſeazed vpon it: the towne was very little repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the former ruine and decay, which was great; the caſtell had béene better relieued, trenched and made commodious.

               <p>All that could bee in that place of footmen was about three hundred, and beſydes, there might be about fifty Harquebuziers on horſebacke.</p>
               <p>There was in that place reaſonable ſtore of victuals for the time that they were minded to defend it, as well in wine (whereof there was aboue foure hundred pipes) as in corne, meale, ſalt, béefe, and other neceſſary mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions for mans life.</p>
               <p>About the 25. of Nouember, the Lord <hi>Miramont</hi> Sargeant maior of the army, accompanied with the Harquebuſiers on horſback of the army, lighted at the <hi>Barillery,</hi> where afterward the Lord <hi>Neuers</hi> lodged, and from thence went with his company to view the place, and to make his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proches.</p>

So he taking his leaue, and induced either with diſcontentment, or with ſome other affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he ioyned himſelfe to that armie.</p>
               <p>The reſt of the troups were ſafely conducted nigh as farre as <hi>Luſſen</hi> and Saint <hi>Gemmes,</hi> and were left there vpon the conditions aboueſaid, by the Herault and Trompet. But the Lord <hi>Sagonne,</hi> Colonel of the light horſemen, did ſo cut the time prefixed (that deſirous as it was ſuppoſed to reuenge the death of ſome friend of his in that armie, who had been ſlayn before in that place) ſurprized thoſe companies who were at S. <hi>Albine,</hi> and charged them ſo hardly, that ſcarce they had time to get into a church, and to ſhut themſelues therein. They were without munition of neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry things, ſo that they were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pelled to render themſelues yet once againe hauing little reſiſted. This compoſition was not like the firſt, for they had onely their liues: they were vnarmed and ryfled, and ſome few were ſlaine. With a ſpeedy retire they might haue auoyded that iniurie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Montagne</hi> ſo ſurrendred; the towne of <hi>Ganache</hi> was greatly threatned. The Marqueſſe of <hi>Beliſle,</hi> who made his abode at <hi>Maſchecow,</hi> deſired greatly to be dicharged of ſuch neighbours. And beſides, this place was very fit for him, if by the meanes of that armie he coulde haue gotten it. This place pertained to the Lady of <hi>Landimoys,</hi> of the houſe of <hi>Rohan,</hi> who had retired to <hi>Nantes,</hi> obaying the kings Edict concerning the alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of religion.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> had giuen the gouernement of this place, to the L. <hi>Pleſsis Gette,</hi> the which diuers times, but ſpecially a few dayes afore the ſiege, had been greatly laboured by the ſaid Lady, &amp; alſo by the Marqueſſe
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:8966:168"/>
of <hi>Beliſle,</hi> with faire and large promiſes, to yéeld the place into their hands, to whome he would neuer hearken, but determined to keep it faithfully. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1588. Decemb."/>
               </p>
               <p>The towne of <hi>Ganache,</hi> being diſtant from <hi>Montagne</hi> but ſeauen leagues, the Lord <hi>Pleſsis</hi> fore ſeeing the ſiege, diſpatched withall diligence to the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> (who was at <hi>Rochel)</hi> the Lord <hi>Sabloniere</hi> and <hi>Ieſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerant,</hi> to let him vnderſtand the ſmall commodities that they had, to holde that place againſt a royall army. That notwithſtanding the ſaide Lorde <hi>Pleſsis,</hi> with the reſt of the Captaines with him, had determined to doo him good ſeruice, ſo that he would furniſh them with meanes.</p>
               <p>At theſe newes, the King diſpatched the Baron <hi>Vignoles,</hi> with all his companies, to ſtrengthen that place. He ſent alſo by ſea, two Captaines of the regiment of his gardes, vnder the conduct of the Lordes <hi>Aubiguy,</hi> and <hi>Robiniere,</hi> who imbarked themſelues part at <hi>Rochel,</hi> with powder, pikes, and other munition of warre, part at <hi>Eſande.</hi> But the contrarie windes cauſed them to caſt anker at the Iland of <hi>Rhe,</hi> where they ſtayed eyght daies for winde: during which time, many being ſea ſick were found wanting, ſo that at the imbarking againe, in ſtead of two hundred, were found fewer in number.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Pleſsis</hi> in the meane time laboured hard in the places where was moſt neede, and cauſed the victuals, as well for men as for horſes, to be brought in out of the vilages round about.</p>
               <p>The L. <hi>Ruffigny</hi> arriued there, with 50. Harquebuſiers on horſeback, by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement of the ſaid King, in ſtaying y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſuccor which came by ſea.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ganache</hi> is compounded of a towne and Caſtell, ſituated in the borders of <hi>Poytow</hi> and <hi>Britayn,</hi> yet holding more of <hi>Poytow,</hi> it is diſtant from the ſea three leagues, with an open proſpect on that ſide: of the ſide of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagne,</hi> and <hi>Maſchecow,</hi> it is woody and couered. There is a great poole, which compaſſeth a great part of the towne, vppon the Caſtell ſide, which with diuers brookes, watereth the great medowes about it, that maketh the waies to the towne mooriſh and foule, but ſpecially in winter. The ſaid poole dooth compaſſe almoſt two parts of the towne, to wit, from the ſuburb Saint <hi>Leonard,</hi> to the ſuburb of Saint <hi>Thomas,</hi> which is al the ſide of the Caſtell. The towne is compaſſed with an indifferent good ditch, cut out of a rock; the wall is auncient, flancked with ſmall towers, and made with loope holes, after the olde faſhion; it was found better to reſiſt the cannon, then it was thought it would bee, ſpecially on the ſide where it was battered, the which for being too feeble and naked, (hauing but an olde gate) the Lord <hi>Pleſsis</hi> had fortified and couered with a ſpurre, aſſoone as he had the gouernement of that place, which did him good ſeruice during the ſiege.</p>
               <p>Hee made two bulwarkes more on the other ſide of the towne, toward th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

the forme of a horſeſhoo, the other nigh vnto the cauſie, which dooth kéep the iſſue of the poole: ten dayes before the ſiege, which was the fourth of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1588.

               <p>The worke began to goe forward, after the ſuccour ariued by the ſea, with the munitions of warre, of whome a part was ſent to <hi>Beauuoyre,</hi> by the commaundement of the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> to wit, they which were of the regiment of <hi>Valirant,</hi> who had embarked themſelues with them, who were ſent to <hi>Ganache.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Baron <hi>Vignoles,</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Gaſcoyne,</hi> entred into <hi>Ganache,</hi> as alſo the Lord Saint <hi>George,</hi> by the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> his commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with his companie of 50. Harquebuſiers on horſeback. There was then none of all the forts of ſufficient defence, vpon which occaſion, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> quarters, as wel for the defence, as for to labour about the fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, euery one in his quarter, with ſuch diligence as neceſſity required.</p>
               <p>The Baron <hi>Vignoles,</hi> with his captaines <hi>Piue,</hi> and <hi>Solas,</hi> tooke on him the keeping of the fort of the cauſy, right againſt a broaken chappel of Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> ſuburbs. This fort was commaunded by a little hill, coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with fruitefull trees, and alſo by the ſuburb, for which cauſe they coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red themſelues with barricadoes and Gabions.</p>
               <p>The two companies of the Kings gardes, which were commaunded by the Lordes <hi>Aubiguy</hi> and <hi>Robiniere,</hi> vndertooke the keeping of the fort of the tower, which we haue ſaide to haue the forme of a horſeſhooe.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Ruffigny</hi> with his companie, vndertooke to keepe the fort of the ſuburb Saint <hi>Leonard,</hi> which was the beſt, hauing the ditches full of water of the height of 9. foote.</p>
               <p>Captaine <hi>Beauregard,</hi> who commanded ouer the company of the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuſiers on horſeback, of the ordinarie gariſon: vndertooke to make a fort at one of the corners of the towne, but it was a worke of long time, and ſerued but a little, and coſt much to keepe, and was not begon, but in hope that <hi>Montagne,</hi> which was already beſieged, would debate longer then it did, notwithſtanding, they laboured about it continually: and whereas the Captaine <hi>Beauregard</hi> had not aboue 18. Harquebuſiers of his owne, halfe of the companie of the Lord Saint <hi>George</hi> was giuen him. The two captaines of the two companies of footemen, ordained for the ordinary gar ion, did drawe the lots to whome ſhould remaine the fort which was begun at the gate; ſo it fell to the lot of Captaine <hi>Ferriere,</hi> who laboured ſo hard, that euen in ten dayes during the ſiege, it was made defenſible, and ſerued to good effect.</p>
               <p>The other companie of the gariſon, vnder the commaundement of the
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:8966:169"/>
Lord <hi>Foreſtiere,</hi> a noble man of <hi>Britaine,</hi> was appoynted for the garde of the Caſtle, and the Doue houſe which was in the garden.</p>
               <p>The charges ſo deuided, euery man doth labour; ſome doo pull downe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1588. Decemb."/> the Suburbs; others goe about the Countrey to get men to labour: for there was none of the inhabitants left in the Towne, not ſo much as an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificer, but only a butcher.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Pleſsis</hi> aduertiſed of the ſurrendring of <hi>Montagne,</hi> ſent foorth his forerunners to ſcoure the countrey: they reported the 14. day of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember that part of the armie was alreadie lodged at <hi>Lege.</hi> The morrowe was diſcouered a great troupe of horſemen, who appeared aboue the mils of <hi>Porrieres</hi> to view the Towne.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Perrine,</hi> Lieutenant of the companie of the light horſes of the Gouernour, (who had retyred before to his own houſe, ſuppoſing there to paſſe part of the winter) returned into the Towne about three daies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſiege, and went out with foure or fiue light horſes to view them.</p>
               <p>The 16. day of December againe very early he went out on horſeback, but he had not paſſed aboue halfe a mile when he found the forerunners of the enemie, whereof he aduertiſed the Gouernour. About 11. of the clocke there marched a great number of horſemen, conducted by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord <hi>Sagonne,</hi> followed of many regiments of <hi>Chaſtiagueray, Brigueulx, Leſlele,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hers, who in haſt aduanced to get the Suburbe of S. <hi>Leonard.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe troupes diſcouered by the L. <hi>Perrine,</hi> hee turned face to them to hold them play, &amp; to giue time to them of the Town to prepare to receaue them: which thing could not be done ſo timely, but that when the bel began to ring for the alarum, the enemie was at the entring of the Suburbe.</p>
               <p>The L. <hi>Ruffigny</hi> went to meete them with ſword in hand, &amp; reſolutely followed by the Lord <hi>Vignoles</hi> and <hi>Maretes,</hi> ſons to the Lord <hi>Sabboniere,</hi> and ſome other Souldiers of their companies with them approached nigh them. But the L. <hi>Ruffigny,</hi> for not hauing had leiſure totake his Corſlet, entring into a houſe where he ſawe the enemies lodge, receiued a pellet in his ſtomacke, whereof (being carried thence) two houres after he dyed.</p>
               <p>This his death was occaſion that the Suburbs were loſt vnto the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell ſooner then otherwiſe it had béen. Captaine <hi>Iahn</hi> and fifteene Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers (beſides them who were wounded) of the enemies ſide were ſlaine, aſwell within the ſayd houſe as in the Suburbes, as afterward ſome of the enemies reported.</p>
               <p>For to reſcue them who did fight, came the Baron <hi>Vignoles,</hi> with Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Foreſtiere,</hi> and 40. Souldiers harquebuſiers, who defended all the day that which reſted of the Suburbe betweene the Chapell and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> towne. There was wounded Captaine <hi>Mote,</hi> Standard bearer of the Lord <hi>Vig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noles,</hi> with a pellet in the higheſt part of the thigh, whereof he dyed fewe dayes after. There was before the towne gate beyond an olde hollow way, certaine houſes ſomewhat ruinous. The Lord S. <hi>George</hi> (the alarum be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:8966:170"/>
giuen) went to lodge within the ſame ruinous houſes, aſſiſted aſwell of his owne, as of ſome armed men of the companie of the Gouernour, to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1588. Decemb."/> helpe the harquebuſiers if they ſhould be forced. There alſo the enemie pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented all his forces, and ſent to begin the ſkirmiſh, which was ſuſtayned and continued vntill night; ſo that the enemie was not able to lodge with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſayd ruinous houſes without great loſſe: and ſeeing the obſtinacie of them within, lodged in a village vpon the way to <hi>Maſchecow.</hi> They of the towne loſt a ſouldier, and the Lord <hi>Coulee</hi> was there wounded.</p>
               <p>The night following, the regiment of <hi>Brigneulx</hi> and <hi>Chaſtiagueray,</hi> who had gotten the Suburbe of S. <hi>Leonard,</hi> lodged in the houſes nigh to the Chappell which were pulled downe. Notwithſtanding, they could not ſet vp any Barricadoes, by reaſon of the continuall ſhot which did raine out of the Forts and Curtine; ſo that they could not get out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> houſes.</p>
               <p>All the dayes following, to wit, from the 16. vnto the 29. of December, paſſed away in continuall ſkirmiſhes, as the enemie made his approaches for to lodge, but ſpecially at the comming of the regiments of the Countie of <hi>Beaupre,</hi> who went about to lodge at the <hi>Planches:</hi> for there commonly began the ſkirmiſhes, which neuer ended but commonly by the death of ſome of commandement of the ſide of the enemie.</p>
               <p>Like ſkirmiſhes were daily fought on the ſide of the <hi>Poole,</hi> againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther regiment which was lodged at <hi>Guinefole,</hi> where certaine Gaſcoynes of the gariſon came to hand blowes with the enemie. All theſe ſkirmiſhes were ſo fauourable to them of the Towne, that beſide the firſt day they loſt not one man, onely ſome were hurt; ſo that the enemie could not (during all theſe ſkirmiſhes) get any aduauntage vppon them, not ſo much as the hedges within foure hundred paces of the Curtine and Forts. Euen ten dayes after they were beſieged, they iſſued foorth and pulled downe cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine houſes in the ſight of the enemie, and burned others, and among them a houſe called <hi>Eſcraziere,</hi> from whence the enemie who had lodged therein, was driuen out with loſſe of certaine men. The horſemen alſo did iſſue foorth, and tooke ſo great number of priſoners, that they were enforced to ſend back a great many of them that were moſt vnprofitable: they kept a great number to worke at the fortifications; others of greater calling were put to their raunſome.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Chaſtre,</hi> accompanied with ten or twelue hundred horſes, paſſed at the <hi>Planches</hi> to the place where the Lord of <hi>Neuers</hi> was; and ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing certaine horſemen who were iſſued out of the Towne when he would haue gone to view, and aduaunced ſomewhat for that purpoſe, his horſe fell in a ditch, and had not béen the diligence of them of his companie in ſuccouring of him, and that he was couered with a great number of har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuſiers which followed thoſe horſemen, hee had béen taken by them of the Towne.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="327" facs="tcp:8966:170"/>
As thinges did ſo paſſe there, the Lord <hi>Pleſsis</hi> ſent diuers times to the King for to aduertiſe him of the ſtate of the affayres, and by the ſame meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1588. Decem."/> had anſwere againe.</p>
               <p>Whileſt theſe ſkirmiſhes and blowes were geuen at <hi>Ganache</hi> the artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery was brought from <hi>Montagne,</hi> and tooke the way of <hi>Maſchecow</hi> for to auoyd the foulnes of the other way: they were whole fifteene dayes before they could conuay the ſaid ordinance, although they of the Countrey did ſhew themſelues ſo deſyrous and ready to conduct the ſayd ordinance, that they omitted nothing of all their meanes, induſtrie and labour: but ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the Lord <hi>Beliſle,</hi> for the deſire which hee had to poſſeſſe that place. There was of that artillery twelue peeces of Ordinance <hi>vz.</hi> ſixe canons of battery, foure great Culuerins, and two of a meaner ſort.</p>
               <p>This Ordinance being arriued the 21. of December about noone, the Duke of <hi>Neuers</hi> ſet his army in battell array, and ſaluted the towne with a voley of all theſe peeces, from the top of a little hill nigh the place of exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution about fiue hundered paces from the towne.</p>
               <p>That being done, he ſent an Herault of armes to ſommon the Lord <hi>Pleſsis,</hi> to ſurrender him the towne as vnto the Kings lieutenant.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Pleſsis,</hi> by the aduiſe of al the captaines, anſwered, that he and all his fellowes were moſt humble and faithfull ſeruantes and ſubiectes to his maieſty: but that hee did not acknowledge in all <hi>Guienne</hi> any other lieutenant generall for the King, but onely the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> to whom (&amp; to none other, if it were not by his expreſſe commaundement) hee would ſurrender that place.</p>
               <p>The Herauld was yet ſent twiſe from the Baron <hi>Paluan,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Villeneufue</hi> of <hi>Anjou,</hi> for to find the means to ſpeake to the Lord <hi>Pleſsis,</hi> who knowing the importance of ſuch parley, flatly refuſed it.</p>
               <p>At the ſelfe ſame time that the army did ſo muſter in battell aray in the ſight of all men, a ſouldier Wallon of the companies of <hi>Picardie,</hi> with his ſword in hand drawen, began to runne ouerthwart a great medow right to the Fort of Captaine <hi>Beauregard,</hi> crying <hi>viue Nauarre:</hi> the Duke of <hi>Guyze</hi> is dead, and <hi>Niort</hi> is taken: that voice was ſo high, that it was heard of both ſides; they let flie at him diuers ſhot, but not one did hit him, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his hat. They of the towne were fully aduertiſed by him of the ſtate of the armie, and of the ſtrange euents which had happened at <hi>Bloys.</hi> They vnderſtood alſo of the exploit which the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> had donein igh <hi>Poytow</hi> ſince the ſiege.

               <p>Thence (beeing yet day) the Lord <hi>Ranques</hi> accompanied with ten or twelue Harquebuſiers, left the Lord Saynt <hi>Gelays,</hi> and went the way to <hi>Foys:</hi> he was far gone on his way when he met with ten or twelue horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the enemies, who were thought to bee Albaneſes: hee char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them, and one was flaine, the reſt ſaued themſelues in the forreſt of <hi>Chizai.</hi>

               <p>The Lord <hi>Ranques</hi> ſeparated himſelfe, as is ſaide before, to ſcoure the countrey, the way which goeth to Saint <hi>Jhans</hi> gate of <hi>Niort,</hi> to ſee that no man might goe into the towne, to giue aduertiſement of the things which were done abroad. There were left behinde all the companies, two ſeruants of the Lord Saint <hi>Gelays,</hi> who went on foote, they followed their maſter the way of <hi>County,</hi> to <hi>Niort.</hi> A countrey man was ſent to <hi>Niort,</hi> by the Lord <hi>Ferriere,</hi> Lieutenant of the companie of the Lorde <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licorne,</hi> who then was in his houſe at <hi>County.</hi> This countrey man did ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry letters from the ſaide Lord <hi>Ferriere,</hi> to the gouernour or to the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of <hi>Niort</hi> (a man Leagued turbulent, and at whoſe beck all the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants did tremble) with aduertiſement, that already he had warned them twiſe to take heede, for although the report went, that the <hi>Hugonets</hi> were going to <hi>Coignak,</hi> it was fained, for certainely they had returned back, and went ſtraightly to them. And that he feared leaſt his men had been taken, ſeeing that he had not receaued ſince any newes, which thing cauſed him to ſend to them the third time that countrey man, to aduertiſe them careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to take heede.

When he had read them, hee ſhewed the ſame to the Lords Saint <hi>Gelays, Parabiere,</hi> and others when they came. This had been enough to put them out of heart: but in vaine dooth the garde of the citie watch, when God will ſurpriſe it, there is neither ſafety nor counſell againſt his power.</p>
               <p>The inſolency of the inhabitants of <hi>Niort</hi> againſt the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> and them of the religion, was come to a full meaſure.

               <p>The troupes had already lighted a great halfe league off in the valey, nigh <hi>Vouilay,</hi> and had left their horſes made faſt, with certaine ſeruants to keepe them: they cauſed the Mules which caried the ladders, and other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie things, to goe through the fieldes vnto a quarrie of ſtone nigh the towne, and diſtant onely from the wall a bow ſhoot: there were the ladders vnloaden and deſtributed to them that ſhould occupie them. There were prepared the petar shy two Gentlemen, named <hi>Vileſan</hi> and <hi>Gentil,</hi> who being very induſtrious in ſuch things, ſhould vſe them, which were brought within a ſtones caſt of the wal, and the ladders alſo, and all in the high way that leadeth from <hi>Chiçay,</hi> to the gate Saint <hi>Gelays:</hi> all this ſtirre paſſed without any perceauing of them within the towne.</p>
               <p>The Moone was not downe, nor went not downe foure houres after, which increaſed greatly the feare of them who did enterpriſe, leaſt they ſhould be diſcouered, yet they determined to abide patiently in ſilence, both the great and extreame cold, and alſo the going downe of the Moone, at whoſe ſhining, many lying vpon the froſen hard ground, did ſleepe (being wearie of their long iourney) more ſwéete then if they had béene in their beddes. In the meane while, the Lordes <hi>Ranques, Valieres, Gentil,</hi> and others went to view the ditch, and the place where the ladders ſhould bée ſet vp, and the gates where the Petars ſhould be applyed. When they had viewed all, and ſawe that nothing did ſtirre in the towne, and had made their report, they began to let downe the ladders into the drye ditch, by an eaſie path, and alſo to ſet the Petars to their places. The firſt company ofſkaling ladders, was conducted by the Lords <hi>Ranques, Vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eres, Ionquieres</hi> and others, guided by a Souldier named <hi>Reuaudiere.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At the ſecond companyes of ladders, were the Lords <hi>Preau, Arambure,</hi> and <hi>des Liſtres,</hi> followed by the men which they had in their companies.</p>
               <p>The Lord Saint <hi>Gelays</hi> and <hi>Parabiere</hi> went to the gate of Saint <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays,</hi> where the Petars ſhould play.</p>
               <p>The ſcalado was ſet vp at the wall of the towne, diſtant from the ſaide gate of Saint <hi>Gelays</hi> about thirtie or fortie paces.</p>

They who caried the Ladders were not ſo ſoone deſcended into the ditch, but the Sentinel which was vpon the wall (farre from the place <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1588.

There happened then a great darknes (as commonly doth after the going down of the Moone) which did fauour greatly them which were without, to ſteale away from the eyes of the Sentinel: for without any knowledge of the ſaid Sentinel the Ladders were placed ſafely.

               <p>The Lords <hi>Ionquieres</hi> and <hi>Souſonbre</hi> being vpon the wall, followed with fiue and twentie or thirtie next vnto the Sentinell, caſt the ſais Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinell ouer the wall, and as the remnant went vp the walls, the ſayd <hi>Ion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieres, Souſonbre,</hi> with the Lords <hi>des Liſtres</hi> and <hi>Preau,</hi> and about fiftie with them ſet vpon the garde, where were ſeauen or eight poore labouring men, for the rich men of the towne were aſléepe in their beds: for as they afterward reported, many of them had paſſed the moſt part of the night in playing and danſing, to whom no harme was done, conſidering the ſilence which they kept.</p>
               <p>A ſouldier of them which were entred, apprehending the great daunger of ſuch a ſmall number in ſuch a mightie and populous Towne, cryed to ſet fire to the Petars: ſo that which was ſet at the gate of S. <hi>Gelays,</hi> ſhot and gaue the alarume to the inhabitants, it did open the gate with the ſhot.</p>

The Liefetenant was hurt, and as diſpairing of his life, put himſelf into the hands of ſome gentlemen, with promiſe of great ranſonie, and therupon he was hidden, that it could not be knowen where he was, vntil after his death.</p>
               <p>The reſt of the people which tooke weapons, did aſſemble together in the ſtreate of the town houſe: they let flee certaine ſhott, but without ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, for incontinently they loſt courage, as it falleth out ordinarily in ſuch ſodayne ſurprizes, ſpecially where the warnings are neglected, as had beene done by this Liefetenant of <hi>Niort,</hi> diſdaynfully few dayes before.</p>
               <p>Some caſt themſelues ouer the walls, whereof ſome were ſlayn; others were let down with cordes; many retyred into the Caſtell: others did hide themſelues: ſo that theſe few companyes of the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> in leſſe ſpace than three quarters of an houre entred, vanquiſhed, and remained maſters of the place, without any loſſe more than of fiue men.

               <p>When the day began to appeare, the ſouldiers wandred about for the ſpoyle which was made in the houſes, but ſo that it was done without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny murther, or rauiſhing of woman or maide. And ſo much as was done, happened becauſe it was impoſſible for the leaders wholy to repreſſe it: For it was a town leagued ful of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> had their hands yet defiled with the blood of them of the religion, whom they had euery way cruelly handled, &amp; were rich by the ſpoile of their goods, of ſuch as had deſerued the iuſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation of the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> againſt whom they had behaued them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues no leſſe raſhly than preſumptuouſly.

               <p>The leaders diſpatched incontinently a meſſenger to Saint <hi>Iahn,</hi> to the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> to let him vnderſtand the newes of that execution.

               <p>Wée haue ſéene alſo, how the Lorde hath turned the moſt wicked and damnable oath taken, not at the ſtates, but rather conſpiracie of <hi>Bloys,</hi> to an borrible confuſion, and diſſipation of the wicked: for after that the wicked haue gone continually to wrack and confuſion, and neuer preuailed in any action, but in wrapping themſelues into miſerable treaſons, rebellions and commotions, repleniſhing their ſtreates, with murther and bloud.</p>

               <p>The firſt day of Ianuary 1589. paſſed away with light ſkirmiſhes, but without any great effect. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1589. Ianuarie"/>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond day, they within the towne perceaued that the enemie was remoouing the Ordinance from the place where it was firſt pitched, and yet they could not know vpon which ſide of the Towne they intended to place it, vntill the morrowe being the third day of Ianuary, when it was ſeene at the Chappell Saint <hi>Leonard</hi> couered with gabions, and planted within two hundred paces of the wall. They perceiued alſo another batterie in preparing on the ſide of the Poole in a field toward <hi>Guinefole,</hi> ſo that the batteries did croſſe one another.</p>
               <p>The Winter this yeare was ſo extreame during this ſiege, that the yce did carrie euery where: which thing cauſed great diſcommoditie to them which were beſieged, the earth being ſo hard, that when they began to trench themſelues within, (which was at the arriuing of the Canon) they could not in an houre open a foote of earth, although that they had made pickaxes and tooles for that purpoſe. But this alſo did greatly encreaſe their labour, for at the arriuing of the Canon they had ſaluted the Towne on the ſide of <hi>Maſchecow,</hi> and being lodged within the ruines of certayne houſes there, had planted gabions, which cauſed them of the towne to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue that they ſhould bee battered on that ſide, where they alſo had begun their trenches with much and vnprofitable labour. For as it is ſayd, the ordinance was remooued to another place, now hauing loſt all their former
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:8966:175"/>
labour, they are ſet to worke night and day at the trenches, and when they went out of the watch, without reſt or ſleepe they muſt worke at the tren<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ches: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1589. Ianuarie"/> wine alſo fayled them, ſo that in time and toyle ſo extreame many fell ſicke, but ſpecially of the bloudy fluxe.</p>
               <p>The ſame, to wit, the third day a certaine Corporall was ſent by them of the Towne, to ſee whether there was any meanes to enterpriſe vppon that artillerie, but he was ſlaine with a pellet in the breaſt.</p>
               <p>About noone the enemie ſhot certaine voleyes of Ordinance againſt a gate of the Caſtle which openeth into the garden, where they ſawe by the moouing of the earth, that Pyouers were at worke.</p>
               <p>The fourth day, they within the towne at the breaking of the day, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing the preparations for the batterie, found themſelues hardly diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, for that they had no trenches againſt the batteries, and that it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt impoſſible to make any for hardnes of the ground, by reaſon of the froſt, and yet they laboured hard about it day and night in that ſort as is aforeſayd. Whileſt the Gouernour and the Captaines were aſſembled to take aduice what was expedient to be done, one of the companie propoſed, that it were good to ſend a Drommer to play with his Dromme toward the broaken Chappell, vnder colour of making exchange of priſoners, and in the meane time to delay the batterie of the enémie. This was conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but afterward it was reuoked, by reaſon of the diſaduantage which might enſue, leaſt the enemie vppon that occaſion ſhould thinke, that they fearing the trench did ſeeke occaſion of parley.</p>
               <p>Then the two batteries began, the one did beat the Fort of <hi>Beauregard,</hi> and that which was made aboue an old gate, as is ſaid aſore: the other bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery did beat at the other ſaid Fort which was vnder the gate. That which was made out of the old wall reſiſted the fury of the ordinance farre better then it was thought it would: for from halfe an hower after Sunne riſing vntill Sunne ſetting, it neuer ceaſed to thunder without any intermiſſion, ſo that there was let flie that day aboue eight hundered canon ſhot.</p>
               <p>The night beeing ſo neere, they who were beſieged ſaw no apparance that the aſſault would be geuen, and had not prepared themſelues to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the enemy that day, conſidering that the breaches were flanked with two fortes, which were firſt to be forced: notwithſtanding all the French footmen and Swiſſers were ſeene a farre off in battle array about noone, which was the cauſe that they deuided ſpeedily the ſmall number of men which they had to keepe the Fortes: but ſpecially the two Fortes which flanked the breaches on both ſydes. They prouided alſo a certayne number to keepe the breaches if the enemy ſhould proffer the aſſault.</p>
               <p>They were not aboue two hundred and threeſcore perſons which were of ability to defend the breaches, for the reſt were either ſicke or hurt, or els occupied to keepe the fiue Fortes which were without.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="338" facs="tcp:8966:176"/>
The Gouernour tooke vppon him to keepe the breach which was at the left hand, with a hole to paſſe to the Fortes if they were aſſaulted, beeing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1589. Ianuarie"/> aſſiſted with twelue men lying in couert, and certaine Harquebuziers.</p>
               <p>The Baron <hi>Vignoles</hi> was appointed to keepe the breach, which was aboue the gate, with fiue armed men, and fifteene Harquebuziers: and for as much as that number was not ſufficient, the Gouernour appointed the Lord <hi>Perrine</hi> to aſſiſt them with fiue armed men more.</p>
               <p>When the breaches began to be reaſonable, euery one hauing ſixteene long paces breadth, the whole army beeing in battell array, the enemy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſtyrre, and marching with a ſwift pace, ſtouping low, they ſet on both ſides of the Fortes which were aſide of the breaches.</p>
               <p>The enemy ſuſtayned the firſt onſet, wherewith theſe two Fortes recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued them and paſſed throug, halthough that many remained vpon the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſaluted by them of the Fortes with ſhot, and with the force of the pikes, yet in a little ſpace they were maſters of the two fortes.</p>
               <p>They might haue defended the ſaid fortes longer, but two cauſes did let them, the one was the ſmall number of the defendants, the other was the death of the Lord <hi>Mareſtes</hi> yongeſt ſonne to the Lord <hi>Sabloniere,</hi> and brother to the Lord <hi>Vignoles,</hi> who after the death of the Lord <hi>Ruffigny,</hi> commaunded ouer his company and one of the fortes which had befollen him: his was ſlaine with the ſhot of a Culuerin. This his death did greatly haſt the forſaking of that fort: his brother the Lord <hi>Vignoles</hi> made great mone for him.</p>
               <p>The Fortes beeing wonne, it was high time for them which kept the breaches to beſtirre and defende themſelues: and as they were aſſaulted furiouſly by the enemyes, ſo they receaued them coragiouſly. There was all manner of defence vſed, ſhot, pikes, pomgarnads, fiery hoopes, ſtones, and all other manner of defence were throwen vppon the enemy.</p>
               <p>Many of the enemies hauing the night fauourable, retyred vnder the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow therof, they who did obſtinate themſelues either were wounded, or els remayned dead in the place: in this aſſault happened a thing worthy to bee noted. The Baron <hi>Vignoles</hi> had a frend in the army named <hi>Poyſſon,</hi> a man of charge in that ſeruice. This man was greatly carefull for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation of the ſaid Baron, and deſirous to ſaue him, prayed a Captaine of the regiment of <hi>Chaſtiagueray</hi> (whoſe Standerd bearer was very ſicke) to geue him his enſigne for that day onely, determined to enter one of the firſt to ſaue his friend, the ſayd Baron <hi>Vignoles:</hi> the Captaine deliuered him his enſigne according to his requeſt. <hi>Poyſſon</hi> at the aſſault geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, was one of the firſt which went vp to the ſame breach, which the ſaid Baron <hi>Vignoles</hi> kept, intending to haue ſaued him, but the ſaid <hi>Poyſſon</hi> beeing not knowen by his friend <hi>Vignoles,</hi> was receaued by two Harquebuze ſhot, which did bear him downe to the ground, ſo that he was carried away.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="339" facs="tcp:8966:176"/>
The heat of the fight dured a long hower, and after that time the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies began to faint, but on the contrary their courage was doubled that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1589. Ianuarie"/> were on the breaches. Euen ſome of the ſouldiers who were gone towards the Caſtell to take breath, after they had retyred within the forts, ioyned themſelues againe to the defenders of the breaches. Then went they apace to worke vpon the enemy.</p>
               <p>There was great diſorder in the retire of the enemie, for moſt part of them did caſt away their weapons, and loſt them in the ditch, and in the fortes which they forſooke. Many were drowned in the ditch, caſting them ſelues downe from the fortes vpon the yce, which (by reaſon of that) brake vnder them.</p>
               <p>The ditches were incontinently lighted with a number of torches and linkes out of the Towne and Fortes, for it was very darke.</p>
               <p>The beſieged in the towne ſpoiled the dead that euening, ſome went out of the Forts vnto the brooke, which doth ſeparat the town from the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbe to get armor. Notwithſtanding, a point of humanity was ſhewed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the enemy worthy to bee remembred, for they did not hurt ſo much as to take any thing from the enemies, who were left hurt vpon the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and in the ditches, but rather they were had into the towne, their woundes dreſſed, and curteouſly vſed, euen to the day that the towne was ſurrendered.</p>
               <p>This victory is the more memorable, becauſe about fifty men defended the breaches againſt ſuch a multitude: for all the regiments of the Swiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers alſo aſſaulted the ſame, in witneſſe thereof many of them remayned in the ditch.</p>
               <p>It is alſo to bee noted, that during the aſſault, when they within the towne had ſet fire into a pomgarnad for to caſt it into the ditch, it fell again betweene the legges of the Gouernour, and did burſt without doing any hurt.</p>
               <p>Upon this proſperous iſſue of that aſſault, the Lord <hi>Pleſsis</hi> gouernour, called all the Captayns and Gentlemen to render thankes to God for his gracious fauour ſhewed vnto them.</p>
               <p>On the ſide of the Towne the Lord <hi>Perrine</hi> was killed with a ſhot in the head, whereof he dyed within a while after. Captayne <hi>Foreſt,</hi> and the Lord of Saint <hi>Coſmio</hi> were hurt in both armes.</p>
               <p>Of the enemies ſyde there were found the fifth day of Ianuary aboue fifty dead within the ditch, beſides them who were drowned, and many which dyed afterward in the ſide of the Towne: i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Beſide them whith were wounded in great number, was the Lord <hi>Brig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neulx</hi> maſter of the campe, this man loſt his Sonne at <hi>Montagne;</hi> now he

               <p>The night after the aſſault was beſtowed in fortifiyng and continuing the trenches.</p>
               <p>This day was beſtowed of the enemie in the burying of the dead. The ſame day in the euening, a drumme of the enemie brought letters to the Lord <hi>Pleſsis,</hi> gouernour of the place, from the Lord <hi>Palneau.</hi> When he had receiued them, he aſſembled all the counſell to open the ſayd letters in their preſence.</p>
               <p>The letters in ſubſtance did import, that the ſaid L. <hi>Palneau</hi> had great deſire to ſpeak with him about a thing which would bring him much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation, which he ſaid he could not write. In the ſame letters he prayed the Lorde <hi>Pleſsis</hi> to giue him meanes and ſafe conduct to ſpeake with him.</p>
               <p>All the Captaines gaue their aduiſe, that he could not refuſe that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, becauſe that the Lord <hi>Palneau,</hi> ſecond ſonne to the Earle of <hi>Carauas,</hi> was a faithfull ſeruant to the King, and great friend to the houſe of <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon,</hi> and deadly enemie to the League, and that by him they might alſo vnderſtand newes of the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> whereof they were in great care.</p>
               <p>The 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> day of Ianuary, the Lord <hi>Palneau</hi> accompanyed with the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Grange,</hi> who was of the regiment of Countie <hi>Gra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>pre,</hi> went to the fort of the tower of the Caſtell, made after the forme of a horſeſhooe.</p>
               <p>During this parley, they began the battery with two pieces at the breake of the day: about noone they encreaſed with three pieces more, and continued till night. There were beſtowed that day aboue eight ſcore Cannon ſhot. There were two ſouldiers ſlaine, whereof the one was named <hi>Bourg,</hi> of the company of the Lord. <hi>Vignoles:</hi> there was great m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ane made for that man for his great valour, for he was a rare patterne of godlines and vertue.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Pleſsis</hi> going foorth to that parley, accompanied with the Lord <hi>Ayomont,</hi> vpon returne, reported to the counſell, that the Lorde <hi>Palneau</hi> had notified vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that the Duke of <hi>Neuers</hi> had determined not to vnbit nor to depart from that ſiege before he had ſalued his honour, and to that end he would ſpare no friend, no meanes, nor authority. That his ſtay there in that ſiege did hinder the affaires of the king of <hi>Nauarre</hi> more than they did think.</p>
               <p>That the King did beſiege <hi>Orleans,</hi> by the citadell, where was the Marſhal <hi>Haumont,</hi> and that the king would vſe the forces of the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> againſt the leagued.</p>
               <p>To be ſhort, the Lord <hi>Pleſsis,</hi> and all others which had aſſiſted him, had gotten honour enough in the defence of ſuch a naughty place, and that
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:8966:177"/>
there was no more meanes to ſtand obſtinate in defence of the ſaide place, the ſaid L. of <hi>Neuers</hi> being ſufficiently informed of the neceſſities, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they were as well of men who were greatly weary, as of victualls. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1589. Ianuarie"/>
               </p>
               <p>That if they would hearken to render that place into his handes, he offered vnto the gouernour &amp; gentlemen, armes, horſes and baggage, and to the ſouldiers, armes and baggage, and for the ſafe conduct, the County <hi>Granprè,</hi> the Baron <hi>Poluan</hi> and <hi>Baſtenay,</hi> Captaine of an hundred light horſes, ſhould conduct them ſafely whither ſoeuer they would goe.</p>
               <p>He gaue them beſide, eight dayes ſpace to aduertize the King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarre,</hi> of the capitulation, and in caſe that the ſaid King ſhould not giue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuccour within the ſayd eight dayes by any meanes, he in his perſon, or his Lieftenant, the ſayd L. <hi>Pleſsis</hi> and his ſhould ſurrender him the place, and they to enioy the benefite of the agreement.</p>
               <p>There were many gaings and commings vpon this propoſition, and at length the affaires being propounded to the counſell, they did ſtick much vpon the voluntary proffers of the Duke of <hi>Neuers,</hi> to giue eight dayes to aduertize the King of <hi>Nauarre:</hi> which made them beleeue that the ſayd king was neither ready to helpe them, nor had ſufficient power ſo to doo, which notwithſtanding was the only hope of them that were beſieged, who otherwiſe could not withſtand if they ſhould be preſſed.</p>
               <p>All things being well conſidered, they determined to hearken to ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantagious proffers, with hope thereby to make the K. of <hi>Nauarre</hi> priuie to their affaires, and for that intent to ſend Captayne <hi>Robiniere</hi> with a paſſeporte, that was concluded and ſealed on both ſides the ſixt day at night.</p>
               <p>The ſeuenth day the truce was agreed, and hoſtages were giuen on both partes, and all acts of hoſtilitie ceaſed.</p>
               <p>The ſame day the Lord <hi>Robiniere</hi> departed with a trompet of the D. of <hi>Neuers</hi> to goe to the King of <hi>Nauarre.</hi> The gouernour in the meane while was greatly carefull, to take heede that no man ſhould goe foorth to viſit or frequent with them of the armie, and alſo that none of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ſhould enter into the towne. To preuent all inconueniences, hee made a diligent watch both day and night vpon the breaches, ſo that hee himſelfe tooke his meales, and did lie thereon, notwithſtanding the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the winter.</p>
               <p>The eleuenth day of Ianuarie, the Lord <hi>Robiniere</hi> returned from the king of of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> and brought with him the Lord <hi>Rinuile</hi> to the Lord of <hi>Neuers,</hi> who after he returned to the king of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> obteined leaue to enter into the towne with the Lord <hi>Robiniere.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By them, they within the towne were enformed, how the king of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarre</hi> had marched forward very nigh, intending to ſuccour them, and to venture a battel for that end, but that he fel ſick with a dangerous diſeaſe;
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:8966:178"/>
which had hindred the execution of his enterprize.</p>
               <p>They reported alſo howe that the ſaid King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> had ſent the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1589.

For the Lorde of <hi>Neuers</hi> had lodged and trenched himſelfe in ſo aduantagious a place, that the towne could not ſayle but fall into his hands, except it were reſcued by the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of a battell, which thing the time pref<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Duke of <hi>Neuers</hi> vpon this alarum, feared greatly, leaſt the Lord <hi>Pleſsis</hi> ſeeing that helpe nigh, would haue receiued ſome ſuccours with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the town, interpreting the tearmes of the agreement to his aduantage.

               <p>The 14. of Ianuarie, the Lord of <hi>Neuers</hi> perceaued that they within the town, went faithfully to worke, for euery man diſpoſed himſelfe to depart: alſo he vſed much courteſy toward the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who were beſieged, prouiding carts for them, whereof they had need to carie as well their bagage, as the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which were wounded, &amp; cauſed them to iſſue foorth out of the ſight of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> army, leaſt they ſhould bée moleſted by any man.

               <p>So then the ſaide Duke of <hi>Neuers</hi> hauing receaued the towne of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nache,</hi> as is aboue ſaid, on a ſodaine that great and furious army was broa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to pieces, as ſmitten with the finger of God. Many there dyed, many were hurt: they of the League liuing in great miſtruſt, either did diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble their actions, or retired to ſuch places of ſafetie, as they thought moſt fit: the artillery returned into the places from whence it was taken. The Lord of <hi>Neuers</hi> went to <hi>Bloys;</hi> withall the reſt of the armie as remained with him, whereof a part was ſent to the Marſhall <hi>Haulmont,</hi> who in the Citadell fought with the inhabitants of <hi>Orleans:</hi> within a few dayes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:8966:178"/>
the Lord of <hi>Neuers</hi> went from the court, to his houſe of <hi>Neuers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So all the lowe <hi>Poytow,</hi> which had béene terribly threatned with that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1589. Ianuarie"/> tempeſt, was deliuered by this ſodaine and vnexpected alteration. For the execution which was done at <hi>Bloys</hi> vpon the perſon of the Duke of <hi>Guize,</hi> was as an horrible thunderclap, not onely vnto the leagued, which were in the army of the L. of <hi>Neuers,</hi> of whom the moſt part did conſiſt, and to others who were in multitudes in moſt partes of the realme, but alſo vnto all others of that confederacie which were out of the realme. For the newes fléeing as farre as <hi>Lorreyne,</hi> the forces of the Duke of <hi>Lorreyne,</hi> which had blocked <hi>Iamets</hi> in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſoueraignty of <hi>Boillon,</hi> euer ſince the moneth of Aprill before, were ſo amazed by the vnexpected loſſe, and ſurpriſe of that ſupport, that they taking ſodainely bagge and bagage, as men frighted out of their wittes, brake the ſiege, and retired away: ſo that God there deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his Church after a long and daungerous triall, which ſhall induce the poſteritie, to feare and admire the iuſt iudgements of God, who within a moment, and by euents, not forſéene by mans wiſdome, dooth turne vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide downe the counſels of the wicked, to the ioyfull deliuerance and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of his ſaints. Righteous O Lord are thy iudgements, all thy waies are righteouſnes and trueth.</p>
               <p>The army of the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> returned to <hi>Niort</hi> and <hi>Fontenay.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is ſaid before, how after the ſurpriſing of <hi>Niort,</hi> the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> repayred to the ſaide towne, the 27. of December, and ſoiourning there a while, there he gathered the greateſt part of his forces, and about the 6. day of Ianuarie, in this yeare 1589. the ſaid King departed, with ſuch forces as he had from <hi>Niort,</hi> toward the towne of <hi>Ganach,</hi> intending to ſuccour them, who were beſieged therein, or elſe to fight with the Duke of <hi>Neuers,</hi> if he would haue let him. But God who gouerned all things, with an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearcheable wiſdome, diſappointed that enterpriſe by that dangerous ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, which fell vpon him.</p>
               <p>The cold was very extreame, and as he is a moſt laborious Prince, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had béen long on horſeback all armed, a great cold came vpon him, ſo that he was enforced to light downe of his horſe, and goe on foote with a ſwift pace and violent motion to get him ſome heate: and a little after hee had eaten, a ſtrange extraordinarie cold tooke him, with a great feauer.</p>
               <p>About the 9. day of Ianuary it was incontinently perceiued that it was a pleureſie. This happened at a little village called S. <hi>Pere:</hi> there he was enforced to ſtay, without any meanes to tranſport him to any other place, (by reaſon of the ſharpnes of the ſickneſſe) but to a little Caſtle nigh that village, where being, the ſickneſſe did ſo increaſe that many doubted of his life. He alſo reſolued himſelfe conſtantly to abide the good will of GOD, readie willingly to end his life (if Gods will was ſuch): the thing that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grieued him (as that good King <hi>Ezechias)</hi> was the néede which the
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:8966:179"/>
Church of God might haue of his preſence in <hi>France,</hi> (if he ſhould fall) and alſo the want of his fidelitie in that kingdome, if in the middeſt of ſo many great troubles and confuſions he ſhould be taken out of this world. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1589. Ianuarie"/> he ceaſed not (as much as the diſeaſe which was ſharpe and violent did permit him) to prouide &amp; ordayne for the affayres of his armie, according as the occaſions did fall out. He was let bloud, and worthily ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and ſuccoured by them who were about him, as much as the diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie of the place could permit them.</p>
               <p>He ſent to all the Churches round about to make prayers and ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations for him, which was done with much feruencie and ſorrowe.</p>
               <p>The newes of his daungerous diſeaſe were brought to <hi>Rochel</hi> in the euening being the 13. day of Ianuary. The congregation was called ſpée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily with the ringing of the bell to repayre to the Temples. This was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſeauen of the clocke at night, (an houre not vſed to ſuch méetings) the neceſſitie notwithſtanding requiring the ſame. The people aduertiſed of the cauſe, ranne with ſuch multitudes to the places of prayers, ſo that the like was neuer ſeene in that towne. All manner of men indifferently, euen children and apprentiſes forſooke the houſes to repayre to the Temples; the multitude was ſuch, that many being not able to goe in, went home a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne heauie &amp; ſad, anſwering by their priuate prayers to thoſe that were made in publike, with much lamentation and teares. For all men knewe well the greatnes of the affliction throughout all <hi>France</hi> generally, if God at that time (ſo troubleſome and confuſed) had taken out of this life that firſt Prince of the bloud, whom he had endued wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h ſo many graces. The ſayd extraordinary prayers were continued for the ſpace of many daies, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till that the recouering of his health was certainly knowne.</p>
               <p>The rumour of his death was ſpread into diuers places of the Realm, euen at the Kings Court, for the which reports all good and true men did greatly mourne. The great contentation which the leagued receiued there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of dured not long; for the King receiued newes ſhortly after of his reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie.</p>
               <p>It is ſayd before, how that after the execution done vpon the perſon of the Duke of <hi>Guize,</hi> the King ſent into the Prouinces to aduertiſe the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours, Magiſtrates and people, of the iuſt cauſes and neceſſitie that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced him to doo that execution. And interrupting the continuance of the euents which followed that execution, we deſcended into the lowe <hi>Poytow,</hi> there to ſee what exployts the great royall armie (conducted by the Duke of <hi>Neuers)</hi> had done there, and alſo what the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> did all that while. Now hauing ſeene that armie to haue made ſhipwracke and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed out of ſight, we will leaue the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> being in bed ſicke of a dangerous pleuriſie, expecting health of the Lord which giueth ſaluation vnto Kings, and to reſtore him to his health and ſtrength, and will come
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:8966:179"/>
to the matter agayne, and conſider the horrible accidents which followed the death of the Duke of <hi>Guize,</hi> and of the bounſing Prieſt the Cardinall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1589 Ianuarie"/> his brother.</p>
               <p>After this execution done vpon the bouldeſt authors of the conſpiracie, and the reſt of the heads of the ſame being in holde, there was great hope that the burning fire of all ciuill diſſentions ſhould be on a ſudden quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the flaming torches of tumults being put out. But the newes of the ſayd execution of the Duke of <hi>Guyze</hi> being brought into all parts of the Realme, by them that fled without bootes and ſpurres out of the ſuburbs of <hi>Bloys:</hi> the report came alſo to the Duke <hi>de Mayne,</hi> being then with an armie in <hi>Liomoys,</hi> he taking with him ſuch as would followe him, went out of the Countrey for two cauſes. Firſt, fearing (vppon theſe newes) the neighbourhood of them of <hi>Daulphine, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ienoys,</hi> and <hi>Viuarets,</hi> who might haue doubled their courage vpon that occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, being there moſt of the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med religion.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that becauſe of the death of his brother (the hope for the which he and his brother the Duke of <hi>Guyze</hi> did greatly enuie and malice one an other) with mutuall ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>red, doth now proffer it ſelfe vnto him, without any manifeſt competitour.</p>
               <p>This Duke <hi>de Mayne</hi> therefore now ſwallowing downe the crowne of <hi>France</hi> in one morſell by imagination, with as many as would follow him, made haſt into <hi>Burgondie,</hi> and <hi>Champaigne,</hi> and there made ſure to himſelfe in thoſe Prouinces as many places as hee could, preparing all thinges to warre agaynſt the King.</p>
               <p>Here it might bee thought ſtrange, how the Duke <hi>de Mayne</hi> doth ſo cruelly mooue warre and rebellion againſt the King, ſeeing that it was he himſelfe and his coſin, the Duke <hi>d'Aumale,</hi> who gaue aduertiſement to the King of the conſpiracy, and intent of his brother the Duke of <hi>Guyze,</hi> as is aforeſayd.</p>
               <p>The queſtion is eaſily reſolued: there is no fayth nor fidelity among them, who do aſpire to the ſame one kingdome, there is no ſociety, be it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo ſworne and holie. Theſe three, to wit, the Duke of <hi>Guyze, Mayne,</hi> and <hi>Aumale,</hi> did affect the Kingdome: but becauſe the Duke of <hi>Guyze</hi> was more fauoured of the partakers then the other two, he was carryed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>too, as if it were vpon the ſhoulders by all the partakers, who attaining vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, would haue eſtabliſhed the ſame to himſelfe and to his Sonne already in mans eſtate, and to his poſterity.</p>
               <p>The Dukes of <hi>Mayne</hi> and <hi>Aumale</hi> (no doubt) did loue more the Duke of <hi>Guyze,</hi> and would haue had the Crowne rather vppon his head, then whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e it was: yet according to the rules of the Diuinity of <hi>Sorboun,</hi> that charity beginneth at it ſelfe, they would haue worne the Crowne of <hi>France</hi> euery one vppon his owne head, rather then that any other ſhould
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:8966:180"/>
haue had the occupying of it howſoeuer great and deare friend hee might haue béene. This emulation about the affectation of the Crowne, was the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1589. Januarie"/> cauſe that theſe two, to wit, the Dukes <hi>de Mayne,</hi> and <hi>Aumale,</hi> each of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in reſpect of himſelfe diſcouered the conſpiracy to the King, to the end that he beeing made away, they might march a playne way in the ſame ſteps which hee had traced before them, reſeruing to the craftieſt or mightieſt hereafter to oppreſſe his coſine: for it is not to bee thought that there would haue beene more vnion and loue betweene the Dukes of <hi>Mayne</hi> and <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male,</hi> beeing but coſins, then there was between the Dukes of <hi>Gnyze</hi> and <hi>Mayne,</hi> being brothers.</p>
               <p>Thus wee ſee what ambition did worke in theſe new men by affectation of that roall dignity, which doth not touch them at all, and without any likelihood euer to approch néere vnto, namely rebellion agaynſt their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne and benefactor, and parricide among bretheren, one to preuent another.</p>
               <p>The newes of the death of <hi>Guyze</hi> beeing brought into the Prouinces, the moſt part of Towns and Citties from the riuer of <hi>Loyre,</hi> Weſt, North and Eaſt, being already ſurpriſed aforehand, and ſeduced from the Kings obedience by the Leaguers, vppon the rumor of that execution were ſo greatly mooued (the Duke of <hi>Guyze</hi> beeing accompted the onely piller of Popiſh religion, by the perſwaſion which the Catholikes had conceaued of him) that they began euery where to wauer, and kindle to a manifeſt rebellion, by the ſetting on of the Leaguers, who were the greateſt part in number euery where. They did greatly by their inuectiues make heynous and odious that execution vppon the perſons of <hi>Guyze,</hi> and the Romiſh Prieſt his brother, tearming it the Maſſacre committed at <hi>Bloys.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus the iuſt iudgement of God, iuſtly taking vengeance for ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny murthers, ſhedding of innocent bloud, and innumerable villanies com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted vppon the ſaintes of God, and for ſtopping their eares at the cleere and lowd voice of the Sonne of God, who ſo louingly hath called them by his word &amp; promiſes, by his threatnings and plagues ofpeſtilence, famine and warre, gaue them ouer to a reprobat ſence, with a ſenceles rage to fall to commit ſuch cruelties among themſelues, that no enemy would or could haue deſired or deuiſed greater; their towns and citiesbeeing euery where repleniſhed with maſſacres, robberies, baniſhments and proſcriptions, not committed agaynſt them of the religion, but euen of popiſh Catholikes againſt popiſh Catholikes, of Idolaters againſt Idolaters, of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers agaynſt murtherers: ſo the Lord hath ſent euill Angels among them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paris</hi> the capitall cittie of the kingdome, as they more hoped vppon the Duke of <hi>Guyze</hi> then any other did, ſo they ſhew themſelues moſt offended. There were firebrands which kindled the ſedition to the vttermoſt, to wit,
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:8966:180"/>
the Ducheſſes of <hi>Guyze</hi> and <hi>Nemours,</hi> who with their outcries and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations did animate the people to a raging madnes. Thereunto alſo added <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1589. Ianuarie"/> the Ieſuits and Fryers (ſet on by the aforenamed) all their inuectiues in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent and vnreuerent wordes in their ordinary tragicall outcryes, in their Pulpits, and philippicall ſermons to make the people obſtinate, deſperat, and vntractable, to be hereafter reduced to any obedience.</p>
               <p>Other Cities followed the example of <hi>Paris,</hi> as <hi>Orleans, Roen, Anieus, Abeuille, Reymes,</hi> and <hi>Tholoſe,</hi> whereby the conſpiracy and ſetting on of the Biſhop of the place, in moſt cruel maner they tooke the firſt preſident of the court of Parliament, there hanged him vpon a Gibet, and afterward drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his dead body about the ſtreets, beeing one of the moſt zealous romiſh Catholikes which then could liue in this world; the onely cauſe was that he would not allow their rebellion.</p>
               <p>The King vnderſtanding the great ſturres, perilous flames of rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in moſt part of the townes and cities of his realme, ſuppoſing by impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, which he calleth clemencie and gentlenes, to quench that fire, which was already too far kindled, writeth his declarations, emporting an obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uion of all iniuries to be publiſhed in all his Parliaments, and other courts in Prouinces.</p>
               <p>Firſt, he ſheweth how oftentimes hee hath borne with the perturbers of his realme, not onely in forgiuing them their offences, whome hee might haue iuſtly puniſhed, but alſo by winning them by all fauours poſſible to be ſhewed, onely thereby, ſéeking the preſeruation of the peace of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, and of the Catholick religion, vntill that hee was certainely infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that they had conſpired againſt his perſon, life, and eſtate, ſo farre as he was inforced to make that execution extraordinarily.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he ſheweth, that although many had béen of that conſpiracy, whome he might haue iuſtly puniſhed, yet for the loue which he beareth vnto all Catholicks, hée hath ſtayed the puniſhment vpon the two chiefeſt authors of the euill.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, he proteſteth that he will haue the edict of reunion obſerued in all poynts, burying al the former offences in perpetuall forgetfulnes, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth his iudges and officers in all his courtes, to make no inquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the former offences, willing all men to liue in peace vnder his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and if not, hee chargeth his officers to make exemplary iuſtice of the offenders.</p>
               <p>The King hauing aſſembled his eſtates, as is ſaide before, ſuppoſing by their help and aſſiſtance, to haue repreſſed the outragious attempts of the houſe of <hi>Guize,</hi> ſawe himſelfe in the middeſt of them, compaſſed with a company of mortall enemies to his perſon, life, and ſtate. Whereupon deſtitute of authoritie, counſell and help, through puſillanimity, was faine to ſpare the liues of them who were in his power, and of others whome he
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:8966:181"/>
might eaſily haue apprehended, who had their hands as déepely in the treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe, as the chiefe authors themſelues. This was the worke of the Lord, to bring him to the conſideration of his great errors, in refuſing ſo often <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1589 Ianuarie"/> the wholſome and brotherlike aduertiſements of the good K. of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> and other Princes, both within and without the realme, his louing and faithfull friends.</p>
               <p>The more therefore he goeth about with impunity, of moſt grieuous offences, which in his declaration, hee tearmeth clemency, to bring that people of <hi>Paris</hi> (ſeduced from his obedience) to their duety, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable people condemned of God, and in his wrath, appointed to hauock and thra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Therefore hauing committed greeuous crimes all manner of wayes, euen with greedines, at length hauing concluded to withdraw themſelues from their ſoueraignes obedience, the chiefeſt players in this tragedie of rebellion, to colour their diuiliſh paſſions, with the authoritie of Gods law, as though they would haue aſked Gods wil out of his owne mouth, adreſſed them themſelues to the facultie of Theologie, there commonly called the Colledg of <hi>Sorboune.</hi> For that purpoſe they ſent one <hi>Vrban,</hi> one of the Magiſtrates of <hi>Paris,</hi> to the ſayd <hi>Sorboune,</hi> hauing framed in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſupplication two queſtions, to be reſolued by them.</p>

               <p>The eight of Ianuary, the ſaid <hi>Vrban</hi> came to knowe the anſwere of the oracle, which he brought to the counſell of the citie, and after they had peruſed it, taking it for an anſwere of <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thumim,</hi> and a voyce of God, by whoſe authoritie they were put at liberty to doo what they would, with armed hand brought it to the Senate of <hi>Paris,</hi> which was the ſecond Maieſty of <hi>France,</hi> and with drawen ſwordes required of the ſame to approoue the ſaid oracle.</p>

               <p>The ninth day of Ianuary, the ſeditious doo in haſt chooſe a new coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, to the number of ſeauen and forty (who ſhould adminiſter the State in ſtead of the kings prime counſell) of the moſt vileſt and factious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the citie, as <hi>Rowland Compan,</hi> the villanous and inceſtious <hi>Picheuard, Louchard, Rue Clerke, Oliuer Seuault,</hi> &amp; others of ſuch like ſortes, men neither of abilitie, authoritie, wiſdome nor counſell, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe they had ſolde themſelues to the League, to worke all manner of villany, and ſhewed themſelues bitter enemies vnto the King.</p>

               <p>To take ſome of the Princes of the bloud, they knew well them to bee wiſe ynough from leauing their lawfull vocations, to become heades and leaders of theeues, murtherers, and traytors.</p>
               <p>Therefore they concluded to continue the rebellion in the houſe and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly where the conſpiracy (the mother of this rebellion) ſprang out, was nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed and entertayned theſe 40. or 50. yeares continually.</p>
               <p>The Duke <hi>de Mayne</hi> was thought to be moſt fit, as one who in ſo vile an enterpriſe ſhould ſucceede his brother, conſidering that he was brought vp and nouriſhed in the ſame ſchole, learned the ſame bookes, and had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in the ſame degrees as his brother had done, was well acquaynted with ſuch matters from his infancy, will, and ambition, boyling in him as hot as euer it did in his brother; after his brothers death, not much inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our in fauours of partakers to his brother, though not equall in haugtines of mind.</p>
               <p>He therefore by the earneſt ſute and ſolicitation of his agent and parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, is made the head of the rebellion, and inueſted in his abſence of that proude and new title of Lieutenant Generall of that ſtate and Crowne of <hi>France,</hi> which is a Periphraſe of this word King.</p>
               <p>The Duke <hi>de Mayne</hi> now beeing made <hi>manipulus furum,</hi> muſt play the King: for he doth aſſemble all the Captaynes of the ſedition, as name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the aforeſayd counſell newly eſtabliſhed with the Dukes <hi>Aumale,</hi> and <hi>Nemours,</hi> with other ſeditious perſons, few in number, nothing in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance nor authority, to hold the States of the Realme as they did tearme them: aſſembled of the Princes, Nobillity, and Commons, when as there was not one Prince, nor any communalty, but few ſeditious perſons.</p>
               <p>The Dukes <hi>Aumale,</hi> and <hi>Nemours,</hi> and <hi>Cheualier, Aumale,</hi> were made gouernours of <hi>Paris,</hi> to lead the ſeditious people to do ſuch outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and robberies, as neuer were done yet in any towne or Citty in this world.</p>
               <p>Theſe three Captaynes of robbers and murtherers, dayly went to the houſes of them which were knowen to be the Kings friends, depriued them of their authorities, if they had any, put them in Priſons, ranſacked their goods, lodged their robbers (whom they called garriſons) in their houſes, whereof many by a wiſe and prouident mynd, foreſeeing the horrible tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt and thunderclaps which would fall from heauen, vppon that ſinke of traytors, fled out of their houſes, carrying their liues for a pray.</p>

               <p>After many robberies and murthers committed in <hi>Paris,</hi> the ſeditious people were lead by their Captayns vnto the <hi>Loure</hi> the royal houſe, where they committed ſuch outrages vppon the goods mouable which did par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne to the King, that the poſterity will ſcarſe beleeue it.

               <p>The tenth day, whileſt theſe things were dooing at <hi>Paris,</hi> the King cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed an expreſſe commaundement to be publiſhed at <hi>Bloys,</hi> that all the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the houſe of <hi>Guyze,</hi> ſhould depart and retire to their houſes with pardon of their offences, ſo that they would remayne faythfull ſeruants vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him.</p>
               <p>Hee ſent <hi>Cotteblanch,</hi> Prouoſt of <hi>Paris,</hi> and the preſident <hi>Neuilly</hi> to <hi>Paris,</hi> to ſee whether they could reduce that ſeduced people to their dutye: the Lords <hi>Vilaguier,</hi> and <hi>D'Abin</hi> did the like, but neither of them could do any good.</p>
               <p>About the fifteenth day, theſe ſtrange alterations beeing done in <hi>Paris,</hi> vnder colour of the authority of the States there called, and holden by few ſeditious perſons, letters were ſent from they ſayd aſſembly of rebels there vnto all citties of their confederacy, to go forward in the like outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and furie as they had done.

               <p>Now wee will leaue theſe confuſions of Rebells, aſſembled vnder the colour and name of the States of <hi>France,</hi> to procéede further, to fill the meaſure of their treſpaſſe, and will goe to ſee what the King doth at <hi>Bloys,</hi> and elſewhere.</p>
               <p>Immediatly after the death of <hi>Guize,</hi> the King thought good to make <hi>Orleans</hi> ſure of his ſide. The Citadell in the middeſt of all theſe tumults and rebellions of Cities, was and did hold for the King. And the Lord <hi>Antragues</hi> (who a little before had giuen ouer the League) did all that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer he could doo to hold the Citie in the Kings obedience. But the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants being ſeduced afore hand by the Leaguers, partakers of the Duke <hi>de Mayne,</hi> encouraged by the conduct of Captain <hi>Breton,</hi> and others, who did promiſe to the inhabitants readie ſuccour from the Duke <hi>de Mayne,</hi> tooke weapons, and by the confidence which they had in their riches and ſtrength of their walles, did openly reuolt.</p>
               <p>It is commonly ſaid, that the Citie of <hi>Orleans</hi> is the Citadel of <hi>France,</hi> as well for the commodious ſituation of the ſame vpon the riuer <hi>Loyre,</hi> as for the fortifications thereof. Theſe reaſons among others, cauſed the King to trie by gracious and fayre meanes, to bring them backe to their duetie. But reaſon not preuayling, (with a people carried away with paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and ſeduced by the louers of alteration from the obedience of their King) he was compelled to trie by force the meane of the Citadell. He therefore ſendeth the Marſhall <hi>Haumont</hi> with forces as well of footmen as of horſemen, with him hee ſendeth part of his gardes and the Swiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers.</p>
               <p>The inhabitants on their ſide goe about by all meanes poſſible to rid themſelues of the Citadell as of a heauie burthen, they doo beſiege it within the towne ſide, doo trench themſelues, and couer themſelues with horſmen and platformes, doo vndermine it to blowe vp that Fort, (which nothing els but onely one of the gates commonly called <hi>Porte-bamere)</hi> they make iſſues out and euen vpon the Swiſſers with ſome ſucceſſe, they doo thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and raſe that Fort with ſhot of Ordinance on the inſide thereof. They of the Kings ſide doo what they can, there is a great number ſlaine on both
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:8966:183"/>
ſides. The Lord <hi>Antragues</hi> promiſeth (notwithſtanding) to the King to keepe (during the ſpace of a moneth) the out ſide: (although it were but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1589.

               <p>About the 17. of Ianuarie, there went forth out of <hi>Paris</hi> thrée thouſand men, well furniſhed, but young ſouldiours, and not trained vp in warre, to goe to ſuccor <hi>Orleans;</hi> but they were diſcomfited by the Lorde <hi>Montig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> and other Gentlemen, who charged them betwéene <hi>Estampes</hi> and <hi>Orleans:</hi> many of them were ſlaine, the remnant were turned home na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.</p>
               <p>The Duke <hi>d'Mayne</hi> about the laſt day of Ianuarie, ſending ſome ſupply of ſuccour to <hi>Orleans,</hi> ſtayed ſo their eſtate, which did ſeeme to hang a ſide, that they tooke courage, partly by ruines, partly with ſhot of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and other meanes ſo wrought, that they of the Kings ſide were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to giue ouer the ruines that reſted of that, which was called the cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell. By theſe meanes, <hi>Orleans</hi> remained hardened at the deuotion of the League.</p>
               <p>So (good Chriſtian reader) thou ſéeſt how the right of God and man is turned vpſide downe: their popiſh religion, which they would ſéeme ſo much to honour, reuerence, and defend, they haue moſt wickedly propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, vſing it for a couering of their rebellion: thou ſéeſt how the reuerence of all ſoueraigne power and authoritie, is blotted out of the minds of them, the reſpect of all lawes troden vnderfoote, the ſanctuarie of iuſtice violated and poluted: thou ſéeſt here a damnable and diueliſh anarchie, the ſéeds and foundation of a barbarous and intollerable ſeruitude, laied downe in <hi>France</hi> by the Duke <hi>d'Mayne</hi> and his partakers, in a manner in like ſort as <hi>Mahomet</hi> began his rebellion againſt the empire of the Romans. Therefore yée O Noble Princes, and Nobles of all the Kingdoms of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> all men who are the louers of vertue and ciuility, deſirous to reſigne to the poſteritie, good lawes, chriſtian libertie and diſcipline: vp, make haſt to runne vppon theſe accurſed enemies of all mankinde; put out by time that fire which dooth threaten all authorities and powers of an horrible cumbuſtion.</p>
               <p>Now there remaineth but thrée things for the League to bring to paſſe, to ſet vp and dedicate their Idoll which they haue made, to wit, the Duke <hi>d'Mayne,</hi> and to finiſh that piece of worke, which his brother the Duke of <hi>Guize</hi> had brought almoſt to an end, if he had not béen ouerthrown by the way.</p>
               <p>They follow on their accuſtomed courſe and method, vſed by them theſe 14. or 15. yeares, to wit, to ſeduce the people more and more, to make the
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:8966:184"/>
King hatefull to his ſubiects, that hee may bee forſaken of all men if it be poſſible, and to render the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> abhorted of all men, in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1589. Ianuarie"/> hope, that if they could bring to paſſe, any thing vpon the Kings perſon, by theſe meanes the ſaid King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> may be excluded from his right of ſucceſſion.</p>
               <p>The firſt poynt to performe, was left to the aſſembly of the pretended ſtates, as it ſhal appeare hereafter: the other two pieces of work were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Ieſuites, Friers, and other of like ſorte: <hi>de bacchandi &amp; ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomniandiperitiſſimis,</hi> for their dignitie runneth moſt of all vpon theſe two common places.</p>
               <p>Whether the King (conſidering the great neceſſities which hee ſhould haue of money, to maintaine a dangerous and long warre againſt the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels and traitors) had ſent his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſions vnto his threaſurors, and recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of his impoſt, to continue the receauing and gathering of tallages and impoſt, as they had done the yeare before, or elſe that the rebells in <hi>Paris,</hi> vſurping the name of the thrée eſtates of <hi>France,</hi> had forged ſuch a thing, I am vncertaine. But ſo it is, that if they did not deuiſe, yet they did vſe his action, to ſteale away the hearts of the people from his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and thereby to make their part ſtronger, to a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ure the Kings ſubiects to ioyne hand with them in their rebellion. For immediatly after the Duke <hi>d' Mayne</hi> came to <hi>Paris,</hi> they ſet foorth a declaration, bearing the name of the Princes Citties and commonalties vnited, with the thrée eſtates of the realme, where in deede there was not one Prince, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Dukes <hi>d' Mayne, Aumale, Nemours,</hi> and certaine other ſeditious perſons of <hi>Paris, Anious, Roen, Orleans,</hi> and <hi>Abeuile,</hi> with their generall counſell, which conſiſted of ſeauen and forty perſons moſt vile; and for their wickednes, picked out of the ſinke of that rebellion, whereof we haue ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken before.</p>
               <p>Firſt, they doo ſtill hide their damnable rebellion, vnder the olde ragged gaberdine of defending the popiſh religion: and becauſe the poore people had béen of long time oppreſſed with diuers payments, and greatly impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueriſhed by long continuance of warre; vnto the defence of popery, they ioyne this plauſible ſnare, to wit, to eaſe the people of the former accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med payments.</p>
               <p>Secondly, vſurping the royall authoritie, they forbid all manner of offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers to gather any payments, money, tole, impoſt, or tallage for the King, but to pay vnto their officers the tallages, according vnto the rate of the yeare 1576.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, they commaund, that in caſe they haue payed the ſaide ſomms vnto their commiſſioners, and the Kings officers ſhould come to demaund the ſaide ſommes, or ſhould goe about to compell them to pay the ſame ſommes, they to apprehend them, and to bring them vnto the next priſons,

and there proceſſe to be made as vpon publick extortioners.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all, they commaunde all officers, and receauers of the Kings de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maynes, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1589.

               <p>It is ſaid before, that after the Oracle giuen out by the facultie of The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ologie, in the colledge of <hi>Sorboun,</hi> the ſeditious brought it to the Senate of <hi>Paris,</hi> to bee alowed, inregiſtred, and publiſhed, who vppon the refuſing of ſuch a diſloyall treacherie, were all brought to priſon, and there as malefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors detayned.

               <p>And for as much as among thoſe rebellious countreys and cities, there were none of the reformed religion, vpon whome they might ſpew their gall, they called their owne Prieſtes, Parſons, Vicars and Curates, for to ſubſcribe vnto their rebellion, charging them vpon payne of death, not to pray (in their maſſing) for the King. But ſuch as kept an vpright heart to their Prince, and would not conient to their prohibition, but in their prayers or otherwiſe did wiſh well to the King, were executed as male factors: and great fauour was ſhewed them, vpon great intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of friends, if they might eſcape with depriuation of their liuings, or

               <p>The third taſke appoynted to the Fryers and Ieſuites, was to render the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> and them of his part, execrable in the eares of all men, that by the conſent and generall miſliking of all men (if it were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible) he might be excluded from his right of ſucceſſion.

               <p>The 26. of December, the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> had ſurprized the towne of <hi>Niort</hi> in <hi>Poytow,</hi> of the taking it, &amp; of the ſaid Kings gracious goodnes and clemency ſhewed vnto the inhabitants his deadly enemies, which had committed great outrages vpon them of the reformed Religion, againſt his owne perſon, againſt the Princes of the blood, and of late agaynſt the Lord <hi>Valette,</hi> an officer of the Crowne of <hi>France,</hi> as it is ſufficiently ſpoken of before.</p>

               <p>All this lying lybell is eaſily confuted, euen by the inhabitants them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, by the Magiſtrates, by the Prieſtes, who there do liue in liberty of their Religion, and by all the people, who will teſtify that there was no ſuch thing, nor otherwiſe then is recited in the diſcourſe of the ſurpriſe of their towne, but will teſtify of the Chriſtian mildnes, clemency, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deratnes of the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> and ſurpriſers, to haue béene far greater then euer they could haue expected, or had deſerued at his hands.</p>
               <p>But this groſſe kind of lying was ſpread abroad to haſten the rebellion of the Citties, and to render the people vntamed and hard harted, agaynſt true and dutiful obedience whatſoeuer might fall hereafter: as if to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the handes of the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> and of them of the Religion, were to fall among ſauage beaſtes, mad Tygers and cruell Lyons.</p>
               <p>The King conſidering that the more he endeuored himſelfe to winne the rebels by gentlenes, clemency, and promiſing of impunity; the more hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, obſtiuate, inſolent and bolde they became.</p>
               <p>Seeing that he muſt be driuen by force to chaſtiſe their rebellions, firſt he procéedeth againſt them by order of law. And for as much as the Dukes <hi>de Mayne, Aumale,</hi> and <hi>Cheualier Aumale,</hi> he as if it were ſubroged in the places of the Duke of <hi>Guyze</hi> and the Cardinal his brother: the King doth firſt and chiefly proceede iudicially agaynſt them three by proſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as attaynted of fellonie, rebellion, and high treaſon.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the King doth ſhew himſelfe to be a King ordayned and geuen of God, hauing receaued of God that ſword and power which he had not by vſurpation, but by lawfull and naturall right of ſucceſſion.</p>
               <p>Secondly, hee doth ſhew the great benefites, which hee and the Kings his predeceſſors had beſtowed vpon them, and namely, that he hath ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their liues (whom he might iuſtly haue puniſhed for their diuers at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptes, fellonies, and diſobedience) for the loue which hee had vnto them and their houſe.</p>
               <p>He ſheweth alſo, how he had ſince this their laſt rebellion, ſent vnto them diuers of his faythfull ſeruants with letters, and euen Heraulds of arms, to let them vnderſtand his good will and readines to put vp all iniuries &amp; offences, and to receaue them to his fauour. But that in ſtead of humbling themſelues, and of accepting his gracious fauour, they became more inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent: which they haue ſhewed in ſurpriſing his townes, fortreſſes, and in rebelling agaynſt him, his Officers and Magiſtrates, couering their trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:8966:186"/>
vnder the name of Catholike religion.</p>
               <p>Therefore he doth declare the ſayd Dukes <hi>de Mayne</hi> and <hi>Aumale,</hi> to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1589.

This proſcription was declared the firſt day of Februa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. The ſame day alſo the King pronounced the like proſcriptions againſt the rebellious and trayterous Citties of <hi>Paris, Orleans, Anjous, Roen, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beuile,</hi> and others, declaring them conuicted of fellony, rebellion, and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the higheſt degree, willing all his officers to proceede agaynſt them, and againſt al them that doo, or ſhall aſſiſt them by any meanes, and againſt their poſterity, as agaynſt ſuch as they be declared, if they do not returne vnder his obedience by the 14. day of march next following.</p>
               <p>The King intending by theſe thunderclaps to call them to their dutie, purpoſing yet to haue forgotten all offences, for the loue which he had to popiſh religion, common to the rebels with him, and for hatred of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed religion, gaue them (as is aforeſaid) a certayne day prefixed, by the which tyme if they did not returne to their duty, he determined to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſe them by force: and therefore the ſixt day of February, hee ſent forth his commiſſions to all Nobles, Gentlemen, and Captaynes, to prepare themſelues with all furniture neceſſary, to repayre to him the 12. of March following. Neither is the ſentence of the King an ydle threatning, but is (as if it were) a condemnation of Gods law, pronounced by the ſoueraigne Magiſtrate, whoſe puniſhments God hath partly executed, and partly hath reſerued to execute hereafter in the fulnes of time.</p>
               <p>About the middle of February, the King vnderſtanding what had paſſed in <hi>Paris,</hi> how the rebels had enforced the Senat to ſwear an vnion againſt him, his life, perſon and eſtate, did tranſport the exerciſe of iuſtice, and of all his courts, and chambers of Parliament from <hi>Paris:</hi> and alſo all other courts of iuſtice in the aforeſaid townes of <hi>Orleans, Aujous, Abeuile, Roen,</hi> and others, to his citie of <hi>Tours</hi> vpon <hi>Loyre,</hi> deprauing the ſayd trayterous cities of al offices, dignities, charges, and priuileges, commaunding al his Iudges, Counſellers, &amp; officers of al his courts in the ſaid cities, to repaire to the citie of <hi>Tours</hi> vpon <hi>Loyre</hi> by the fifteenth of Aprill next following, there to execute their charges, vpon payne of depriuation of their wages &amp; offices: forbiddeth alſo, that no apparance be giuen by any officer vnto a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuter, and alſo no parties to appeare in any other place ſaue in <hi>Tours</hi> onely before his Iudges there, vpon payne to be declared rebels.</p>
               <p>It is ſayd before, how wee haue left the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> ſicke in bed of
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:8966:187"/>
a dangerous pleureſie, whileſt the League haue nigh filled the meaſure of their execrable treaſons and rebellion. Now the Lord reſeruing that noble Prince, if not to reſtabliſh the flouriſhing eſtate of that Realm, yet he hath <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1589.

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold therefore O great King, the Lord hath reſtored thée to health, ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened thine armes to warre, and thy hands to fight; he hath girded thée with force, conſtancie, wiſedome and iuſtice; the Lord of Armies doth call thee to reſtore true religion, iuſtice, iudgement, Diſcipline and peace, vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly decayed through the malice of thine enemies; be ſtrong and faint not, for the Lord will put a great worke in thine hand to execute.

               <p>Whileſt the King doth ſo thunder the threatnings of Gods lawe, and the claps of his iuſtice agaynſt thoſe Rebels, forſaken and reiected of God (as is afore ſayd); the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> perceiuing the King to be in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe, perſecuted and diſpoſſeſſed out of his Towns and Cities, euen out of his owne houſes by his enemies abroade, and to liue in great miſtruſt of his domeſticall enemies, who did daily eate bread at his owne table; did greatly lament his caſe, keepeth himſelfe quiet beyond <hi>Loyre,</hi> ceaſeth from all acts of hoſtilitie and exployts of warre, leaſt he ſhould encreaſe his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction and heauines. And deſirous greatly to make a proofe of his fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie towards the King, and to croſſe the actions of the leagued rebels, prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth peace to the King, and watcheth diligently that his enemies might not ſet foote in any place where hee had meanes to make ſure for the kings ſeruice, as for the eaſe of them of the religion. So that after the taking of <hi>Niort,</hi> (as is afore ſayd) in the latter end of Ianuary the inhabitants of S. <hi>Meixant</hi> and <hi>Maillezay,</hi> two Townes nigh neighbours of <hi>Niort,</hi> yeelded themſelues vnto him. The Lord <hi>Aubiguy</hi> was appoynted Gouernour of that Iland.</p>
               <p>About the 14. of February, the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> hauing recouerd his perfect health and ſtrength, with part of his forces tooke the field march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing toward the riuer of <hi>Loyre.</hi> The inhabitants of <hi>Lodune, Liſle, Bouchard, Mirabean, Chaſtelerault, Vinonne,</hi> and other places and Caſtles of the countrey of <hi>Turenne</hi> and <hi>Poytow,</hi> offered to open the gates of their townes vnto him, and alſo proffered vnto him their ſeruices. He receiued them ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry courteouſly, and without innouation of any thing; he ſuffered them of the Romiſh religion to liue with all libertie with their ordinarie exerciſes: onely he commanded them of the reformed religion, with the exerciſe of the

               </p>
               <p>About the ſame time many Townes and places in diuers parts of the Realme (which before did ſeeme to bee at the deuotion of the Leaguers) were made ſure for the Kings ſeruice, as well in <hi>Bourgondy</hi> as in other Prouinces, and among others, the Towne and Caſtle of <hi>Sancerre</hi> in <hi>Berry</hi> was ſeazed for the King. That Towne had béen greatly defaced in the former warres: for the walles of the Towne had béen raſed by the Lord <hi>Chaſtre,</hi> Gouernour of <hi>Berry,</hi> who did put a Captaine within the Caſtle for the kéeping of the ſame, and to bridle the inhabitants there who were all of the religion. But after the death of the Duke of <hi>Guize,</hi> the Lord of <hi>Requien</hi> of the houſe of <hi>Montigny,</hi> Captayne of the Kings gardes, ſeazed both vpon the Towne and Caſtle, (the which Towne notwithſtanding it was without walles, yet being ſituated on high and in a ſtrong place by nature) hee vndertooke to fortifie the ſame, by the helpe of them of the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, who did ſo reſort thether from euery where daily, that the ſayd Lord <hi>Requien</hi> waxed ſtrong there (as hee is a valiant man) employed himſelfe with them of the religion, to make warre againſt the rebelled Leaguers for the Kings ſeruice.</p>
               <p>About the 23. of February, the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> being at <hi>Chaſtelerault,</hi> tooke occaſion to ſeaze vppon the Caſtle and the Towne of <hi>Argenton</hi> in <hi>Berry</hi> by the meanes which followe. That place doth pertaine to the Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Monpenſier,</hi> but it was graunted to the Lady <hi>Dwager</hi> of <hi>Monpenſier,</hi> ſiſter to the laſt Duke of <hi>Guize,</hi> by her contract of marriage, hauing that honour ſhewed her, to haue married the Duke of <hi>Monpenſier,</hi> Prince of the bloud, and father to this Duke yet liuing.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of this laſt warre of the League, the caſtell of <hi>Argen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> ſtrong and well furniſhed, was made ſure for the League, the towne remayned at libertie as being not ſtrong, and commaunded by the Caſtell. But after the death of the Duke of <hi>Guize,</hi> the gariſon of the Caſtell was increaſed double, intending thereby to aſſure the towne: alſo the gariſon vnderſtanding of the taking of <hi>Chastelerault,</hi> (which is not farre of) by the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> fearing that which afterward happened vnto them, they ſent to the Duke <hi>d'Mayne</hi> for ſuccour, who ſent certaine Captaines with their companies from <hi>Orleans.</hi> They of the towne refuſing the aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation of the rebellion of the Leaguers, and willing to remaine faithfull to the King, doo aduertiſe him of all their eſtate and good wil towards him, doo require ſuccor of him, as well againſt them of the Caſtell as others, which did approach to ſeaze vpon their town. The diſpatch could not bée in ſo ſhort ſpace, but that in the meane time, they of the towne and of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtell fell at variance vppon the matter, each party truſting in the ſuccour which they hoped for.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="362" facs="tcp:8966:188"/>
The King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> aduertiſed of al this, and of the ſuccour ſent, they there by the Leaguers nigh aduaunced, with certaine troupes of horſemen, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1589.

At the ariuing of the gardes of the king of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> there was a hot ſkirmiſh, and ſome were killed on both ſides: few of the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> his gardes, but many more of the gariſon; but when the Leaguers of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtell ſaw the companies of the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> firſt they were amazed, and ſhortly after, conceauing a great terror yéelded the place.</p>
               <p>After that the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> had taken poſſeſſion of that place, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted the Lord <hi>Beaupre</hi> gouernour there, where he eſtabliſhed the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of the reformed religion with liberty and ſafety, in ſtead of the romiſh religion, as in other places.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> returned to <hi>Chastelerault,</hi> where conſidering how the King was in great danger, both abroad and at home, how hée had euill counſell giuen him, pittying his eſtate, and conſidering that hee could not bée moued, neither to make, nor to accept of his ſeruice for his defence: conſidering alſo that the Leagued rebels waxed ſtrong, and the King weake, he putteth forth a proteſtation, bearing date the fourth of March; wherein he ſheweth, that notwithſtanding his affaires, and eſtate of them of the reformed religion was neuer ſtronger, who within thrée yeares, hath borne the fury of ten mighty armies, whereof ſome had béen beaten to cloutes, the others haue béen ſcattered as duſt in the ayre; hee doubteth not, but the ſame God will ſtrengthen him with the ſame force, and will defend alwaies hereafter his iuſt cauſe and innocency: yet hee dooth proffer them, that if the King will hearken vnto peace, hee was neuer ſo willing to imbrace it. Furthermore, hée proffereth himſelfe to heare reaſon, and to bée taught by a conference and a counſell, promiſing that if he be conuicted by the word of God to be in any error, he will reuoke it, and bring all them of the reformed religion to doo the like. But to bring him out of that religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, wherein he hath béen borne and brought vp, euen from his cradell; with the dint of the ſword, he warneth them, that therein they haue taken a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary courſe, by which they will neuer preuaile.</p>
               <p>Laſt, hee dooth adiure all the ſtates by the name of God, by the aſhes of their anceſtors, by the loue of their natiue countrey, to counſell the King to this ordinary courſe, or elſe to deuiſe ſome better if they can, by the which they may ſtop the ſubuerſion of their countrey.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Briſſak</hi> went to <hi>Angers,</hi> where he thought to cauſe that Citie to rebell agaynſt the king: for ſome of the citie of <hi>Angers,</hi> had hitherto diſſembled their affection and good wills, whch they had to the league and rebellion, as well becauſe they had the king at <hi>Bloys</hi> and <hi>Tours,</hi> who looked to them neerely and narrowly, as for not hauing the meanes to execute their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize. But now at the reuolcing of <hi>Briſſak,</hi> they made him head of their enterprize, for to ſeaze vpon the Caſtell (one of the ſtrongeſt places in all <hi>France).</hi> And for to bring their counſell to a good paſſe with ſpeede, fearing leaſt by delay they might be preuanted by the king, being ſo nigh them; therefore they followe a ſhort courſe: for firſt they trie what cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption may doe.

               <p>The Lord <hi>Pichery</hi> (as a faith full ſeruant to his Prince) refuſed all thoſe proffers: whereupon the Lord <hi>Briſſak</hi> with the reſt of the rebells within the towne did aſſault the Caſtel, and fortified themſelues by all meanes, with trenches and barricadoes vpon the ditch of the ſayd Caſtell.</p>
               <p>Whereuppon the Lord <hi>Pichery</hi> aduertiſed the King of the ſtate of his affayres and attempts of the Lord <hi>Briſſak,</hi> and inhabitantes of the towne.</p>
               <p>The King ſent the Marſhall <hi>Haumont</hi> with the regiment of <hi>Picardy,</hi> and part of his guardes, who were admitted into the Caſtell by the Lord <hi>Pichery,</hi> who opened vnto them the great bridge of the ſaid Caſtell.</p>
               <p>Aſſoone as the Marſhall <hi>Haumont</hi> entred into the Caſtel, although the rebels were in farre greater number, yet the ſkirmiſh began: then was it tyme for the enemy to packe away in haſt, many of the rebels were ſlayne. There they were taken priſoners to the Kings vſe ſo many as yeelded one hundred throuſand crownes for raunſome. Some were executed in the towne, and chiefly ſome Ieſuits and Fryers, who had beene the firebrands to kindle the combuſtion, and the trompets of the rebellion.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Briſſak</hi> (head of the rebellion) there ſaued himſelfe by flight with few of his company, and ſeazing vpon the townes of <hi>Mans, Alençon,</hi> and <hi>Faleze,</hi> cauſed the inhabitants there to rebell agaynſt the King.</p>

               <p>For to breake the good purpoſe and intents of theſe men, and to chaſtiſe them for their too great fidelity to their King: Theſe Ladies ſent for two Captaynes of the towne, well knowen for their ſeditious practiſes &amp; great affection to the traytors; they ſhewed vnto theſe two Captaynes their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, with great amplifications of the thinges paſt at <hi>Angers.</hi>

               <p>The chiefeſt Captaine appointed for this execution, was one <hi>Gaſsion</hi> a Gaſcoine, brought vp in the houſe of <hi>Martignes,</hi> and greatly affected to the League.</p>

The firſt execution of this rebellion, was the apprehending of foure ſcore of the moſt notable men and richeſt families in all the Citie; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1589.

               <p>The Citie being thus made ſure for the League by the Rebells, the countrey about was not free from that tempeſt; light horſes are ſent into places moſt ſuſpected; many gentlemen are taken priſoners abroad, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſpect of age, qualitie or religion: ſuch as did eſcape with the loſſe of their goods, thought to haue ſped well.</p>
               <p>In like manner, the Citie of <hi>Rhemes,</hi> head Citie of the lowe <hi>Britaine,</hi> (which had behaued themſelues modeſlie enough hetherto) might greatly haue fauoured &amp; aduaunced the treaſons of the Duke <hi>Mercure,</hi> if he could haue got it to his deuotion.

All this bleſſed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie, by the counſell of theſe two ſedicious Prieſts, deuiſers of rebellion againſt their naturall and lawfull Prince, doo raiſe vp the people in armes, giuing to vnderſtand (though moſt falſly) that the Lord <hi>Huuanday,</hi> Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant generall for the K. in that countrey, the Lord <hi>Moubarot</hi> gouernor of the Towne, and the Lord <hi>Aſſerake</hi> who accompanied them, would haue oppreſſed the libertie of the Towne, and brought in garriſons to ſacke it.

It was time then for the Lords <hi>Huuanday, Montbarot,</hi> and <hi>Aſſerak,</hi> to keepe themſelues cloſe within their houſes, being ſought out for no leſſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1589.

The Lord <hi>Montbarot</hi> had ſeazed vppon the tower of the gate <hi>Mordeleſe:</hi> hee was ſummoned by the Duke <hi>Mercure</hi> to yeeld the ſayd tower into his hands, which thing he refuſed to doo, ſaying that there he was placed for the King and for his ſeruice. Vpon this refuſall the Canon was brought before the Tower, and many houſes pearced, to make it ready to the battery. There was no appearance to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine a battery, much leſſe to hope for any ſuccour: which thinges béeing conſidered, the Lord <hi>Montbarot</hi> agreed and yeelded the place with hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable conditions both for himſelfe and his fellowes.</p>
               <p>By theſe meanes <hi>Mercure</hi> remained maſter of the place, whereof hee changed the whole eſtate and gouernment, placing therein men at his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion: there he cauſed a Ieſuit moſt bitterly, ſeditiouſly, and vnworthy to inueygh and rayle agaynſt the King: he diſpatched a Captaine Spaniard named <hi>Iohn</hi> with his company to ſcoure y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> country, hee did execrable op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, robbing and ſacking all indifferently, he tooke many gentlmens houſes, which he robbed, &amp; many men whom he cruelly entreated, and put to great raunſoms, ſparing neither Nobles nor others of the romiſh reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, for that onely they were faithfull to the King.</p>
               <p>This exploit done, <hi>Mercure</hi> gathered as great forces of men of warre as he could, and from thence tooke his iourney toward <hi>Fongeres</hi> in the low <hi>Britayne,</hi> a towne which he had gone about long before to ſeduce, and had the chief<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

In the beginning of Aprill the king being at <hi>Tours,</hi> and perceiuing the great dangers which compaſſed him about on euery ſide, hauing many <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1589.

               <p>In the moneth of March following, after the taking of the Citadel of <hi>Orleans</hi> by the rebels, and the ennouatious which they had made in <hi>Paris,</hi> in the changing of the State, and treading downe vnder foote the kings royall authoritie: The Dukes of <hi>Mayne</hi> and <hi>Aumale</hi> began to ſhew ſuch ielouſies and ſuſpitions, which ambition did worke in their hearts, as it did before in the two brethren, to wit, the Dukes of <hi>Guize</hi> and <hi>Maine.</hi> For the Duke <hi>de Mayne</hi> was caryed to the vſurpation of the Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy after his brothers death, as if it were vpon the ſhoulders o. rebells, and would haue had been ſory, if his couſin (the Duke <hi>de Aumale)</hi> ſhould haue had either the whole or elſe any part thereof in ſuperioritie, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſirous that he ſhould depend of his commaundements, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did holde him ſhort, with ſecret practizes and factions.</p>
               <p>The Duke <hi>d' Aumale</hi> would haue beene glad to haue had all to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe rather than his coſin, and if not all, yet he thought to get as good part in the cake as he might; but the factious were not ſo fauourable vnto him as to the other. Fearing therefore ſome Guizien trick (ſuch as hee was well acquainted with) to be played againſt him by the helpe of the muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Pariſiens, he putteth on a good countenance, and after infinite ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, riflings, and manifolde robberyes committed vpon the rich Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunts and others in <hi>Paris</hi> (for in thoſe dayes all rich men were either royalls or hereticks) he departed out of the Citie into <hi>Picardy,</hi> where he thought his parte might bee ſtronger, and hee mought bee in greater ſafetie.</p>

                  <hi>Mercure</hi> on the other ſide, for his part, was content if he might make ſure vnto himſelfe the Dutchie of <hi>Britaine,</hi> ſuppoſing that the throte of his ambition was not ſo wide as that he might ſwallow down the whole kingdom &amp; Crown of <hi>France,</hi> yet betweene them 3. the glorious name of the League, and holy vnion, holy Church, and holy Catholick Religion did rowle among them, and were patched by the Fryers and Ieſuites, for an olde gaberdine to hide vnder all their treacheries againſt the king,

               <p>The Duke <hi>d'Aumale</hi> abſented himſelfe from <hi>Paris,</hi> and in the Ile of <hi>France, Picardie, Brie, Tartenoys,</hi> and <hi>

So that a man comming out of a ſtrange countrey, and ſeeing ſo great diuerſitie of fantaſies, would think himſelfe to wander into a countrey of monſters, or a Citie of mad men: but if he conſider well he ſhall finde himſelfe in the middeſt of <hi>Sodome,</hi> ſo cleane is their conuerſation. Beſide theſe infernall Locuſts, there is a great number of colledges and houſes of learning, for the which cauſe it is called the Vniuerſitie, wherein are chiefly two col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ldges, to wit, <hi>Sorboune</hi> and <hi>Nauarre: Sorboune</hi> is a colledge where Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines and ſtudents of Diuinity cheefly haue allowance: and beſide, it is an aſſociation of Diuines wherſoeuer they haue taken degrees; it is more famous than <hi>Nauarre</hi> by reaſon of their ignorance, but <hi>Nauarre</hi> is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in liuing and multitude of ſtudents.</p>
               <p>This Vniuerſitie was founded, (or rather reformed I feare me from better to worſe) by <hi>Charles</hi> the great, by the helpe of his ſchoolemaſter,

one <hi>Alboinus</hi> an Engliſhman, ſometime ſcholler of the learned <hi>Beda,</hi> who as it ſeemeth changed the former order of ſtudie, and faſhioned them to the forme of doctrine laide downe by the learned S. <hi>Auguſtine.</hi> This <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1589.

Then began <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> to beare ſway in the Diuinity ſchooles, and to fitt in the chayre of <hi>Moſes.</hi> The Biſhop of <hi>Paris</hi> called <hi>Lombard,</hi> went about to amend the fault, and to haue pulled him downe out of that ſacred chayre, propounding to the ſtudents a book of common places (ſuch as it was) called commonly <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter ſententiarum.</hi> Then came the begging Fryers with their wallets full of ſtones, and among them <hi>Scotus,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Aquinus,</hi> they layd down a forme of their dreames &amp; queſtions, they turne the bread of life into ſtones wholy.

               <p>This palpable darknes of <hi>Aegipt</hi> was had in admiration, as the onely wiſedome of the world, fed and entertained by theſe ſeducing Friers and Monks, vntill the waſting of that noble, and in olde time famous <hi>Greece,</hi> by <hi>Amorith</hi> the prince of the Turkes.

               <p>The third part of that Citie, is an Iland betweene the Towne and the Vniuerſitie, called commonly the Citie; that Iland is of the forme of an Egge.

               <p>The Suburbes bee of a wonderfull greatnes, and may bee compared with a great and ſumptuous Citie.</p>
               <p>As this is great and large, ſo is it populous to admiration, ſurpaſſing the report which may be made thereof. The moſt ſort of the inhabitants is a raſcall people of all ſorts of handicrafts, and of ſeruile nature. The people generally is of ſmall ſtature, ſwartie of complexion, of countenance like Spaniards or Italians, fewe like one to another, as it is commonly ſeene among them that are a mingled ſinke of diuers Nations, not like Frenchmen; they are craftie and deceitfull, great bablers and pratlers; ſuſpicious, mutinous and factious; cruell, cowardly and effeminate, lewd of life and behauiour, deſperatly ſuperſticious and idolatrous, fooliſh and ſottiſh ſo generally, that through all <hi>France</hi> they are prouerbially and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachfully called <hi>badins de Paris,</hi> that is, a malapert ſot of <hi>Paris;</hi> of nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and purpoſed folly, diſguiſing and corrupting their tongue and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>

               <p>To pacifie therefore the vprore, about the middle of Aprill he did ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to goe foorth, and taketh the field, making great boaſt that now within fewe dayes he truſted to reduce all <hi>France</hi> to the obeiſance of the League; and the leaſt of his promiſes was, that he would bring the King to that paſſe that the moſt mutinous fellowes in <hi>Paris</hi> deſired to haue him.

               <p>So the Duke <hi>de Mayne</hi> bringeth this holy and inuincible armie (for ſo it was commonly called) into <hi>Beauſſe,</hi> where was ſome good ſtore of vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals, which aboue all things his holy armie deſired.

To goe further, he feared the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> being ſo nigh a neighbour: to goe backe, ſhame (his great bragges and promiſes made to the rebels of <hi>Paris)</hi> would not ſuffer him. Concluded therefore to ſtay in <hi>Beauſſe,</hi> where lodging and victuals for the taking were to be had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out money, liuing in hope, and watching ſtill for ſome conuenient occaſion to execute his damnable purpoſe vpon the Kings perſon, by the intelligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which hee had with the Leaguers of the Court, and of the Citie of <hi>Tours.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>During his ſoiourne in <hi>Beauſſe,</hi> he made the like bragges and promiſes to the Nobilitie and people, as he had done in <hi>Paris.</hi> The Wallons which were in his armie conſidering that nothing was done, and lacking money,

               <p>And becauſe the night drew neere apace, the Prince thought good with all ſpeede to aſſault the other companies of rebels who were at <hi>Comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aux,</hi> who were about a thouſand or twelue hundred men, conducted by the Lord <hi>Beaulieu.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This company had trenched and fortified themſelues, and therefore the moſt part of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cannons, prieſts, monks, fryers, &amp; Ieſuites, of the Citie of <hi>Sees,</hi> and many perſons of the countrey round about, who would ſhewe ſome proofe of their valour, and how they could fight better with a Caliuer then with their Portiſſe: but at length it was found that they had more ſkill in iugling a Maſſe and making of Gods, then in handling their weapons: among them was the Parſon of <hi>Vimonſtier,</hi> a deſperate and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Prieſt. The Lord <hi>Beaulieu</hi> was their captain, who at the firſt on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet the ſayd Lord <hi>Beaulieu</hi> was taken among the firſt in the forcing of the Fort, who being carried away by the Captaine <hi>Chauuayne</hi> before the Prince, ſayd, that there were within that Fort at the leaſt ſeauen hundred well armed and appoynted.</p>
               <p>The Prince vnderſtanding that, commanded the Lords <hi>Bakqueuile</hi> &amp; <hi>Archand</hi> to get into the Fort, and for that purpoſe he left them the Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering, and went that night to <hi>Eſcouche,</hi> where he arriued about eleuen of the clocke in the night. And aſſoone as he was gone, the rebels of <hi>Comeaux</hi> vnderſtanding how their fellowes had ſped, yéelded, with their liues onely ſaued, who were immediatly diſarmed and brought to <hi>Eſcouche</hi> to the Prince.</p>
               <p>There the Duke ſoiourned all the next day being the 21. of Aprill, to take the view of the priſoners, who were in great number of all qualities of perſons.</p>
               <p>The ſame day the Lords <hi>Hallot, Bakqueuile, Beuil, Bellefontayn,</hi> and <hi>Archand,</hi> went abroad with their companies, to ſee if they could méet with any ranging Rebells, where they miſt not much to haue taken the Baron <hi>Vernier.</hi>

               <p>Here (Chriſtian Reader) marke the preſence of God in the aſſiſting of
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:8966:199"/>
a good cauſe, and handled by perſons of lawfull calling.</p>
               <p>Firſt, thou ſeeſt how the King heretofore in the warres againſt the K. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1589. Aprill"/> of <hi>Nauarre</hi> had not proſpered, but all things haue fallen to his owne char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, diſhonour and ſhame, becauſe he perſecuted him without a cauſe, and ſuch perſons were put in truſt of his affayres, and aduanced themſelues forward, intending vnder that colour to ſupplant their maſter. Now, when the King hath a iuſt cauſe in hand, and put men in truſt that are lawfully called, bearing a true and vnfayned heart to the King, kingdome, Crowne and Countrey, ſuch as bee the Princes of his bloud, and other of the true Nobilitie of <hi>France,</hi> the Lord alſo is of his ſide and fighteth for him, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth him victorious, and reſtoreth to him his authoritie by ſteps, as it ſhall appeare hereafter.</p>
               <p>Secondly, here is a notable thing happened, which neuer did happen vnto any Captaine that euer I haue read, ſaue vnto that noble Athenian <hi>Conon,</hi> that a Captaine had obtayned three noble victories in one day, but vnto this noble Prince of ancient and noble raſe.</p>
               <p>Thus the Prince <hi>Montpencier</hi> by theſe victories, gaue a taſt vnto the rebels of the cup of their treaſons, and ſo did driue them into Townes and Holds, that afterward it was rare to ſee any rebels abroade, except it were when they had neede priuilie to ſteale out to robb their nigh neighbours of their goods. Hauing done this exployt, he purpoſed to bring the artillerie from <hi>Courcy,</hi> and returne to the Citie of <hi>Caen,</hi> intending ſhortly after to be in the field agayne, and to carrie by it vntill he had ſubdued the countrey to the Kings obedience agayne.</p>
               <p>By a pertinent digreſſion I haue ſhewed what noble and profitable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployts the Prince <hi>Montpencier</hi> hath done in <hi>Normandy</hi> againſt the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, now we will returne to continuance of the narration interrupted.</p>
               <p>It is ſayd before, how the King ſeeing himſelfe in extreame danger, made truces with the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> and deliuered him the Towne of <hi>Saumour,</hi> for his ſafe paſſage and repaſſage ouer the riuer of <hi>Loyre,</hi> which he committed to the Lord of <hi>Pleſsis Marline.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Few dayes being expired, after the deliuering of the town of <hi>Saumour,</hi> the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> went thether to the great contentation and reioyſing of all the inhabitants, and of all the Nobility round about well affected to the Kings ſeruice, and good of the realme. Liberty was geuen by the K. of <hi>Nauarre</hi> to all the inhabitants concerning religion indifferently, as hée had done in other places.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> hauing ordered all things at <hi>Saumour,</hi> about the 17. day of Aprill went foorth and beſieged the Caſtell of <hi>Briſſak</hi> (the Lord thereof beeing a traitour, and a rebellious Leaguer) and tooke it by compoſition.</p>
               <p>The 18. the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> paſſed all his Forces beyond the riuer of
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:8966:199"/>
                  <hi>Loyre</hi> ouer the bridg of <hi>Saumour,</hi> and within few dayes ioyned with other forces which ſtayed for him, gathered out of <hi>Normandy, Mayne, Anjou,</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1589. Aprill"/> 
                  <hi>Perche, Beauſſe,</hi> and other countries beeing betweene <hi>Loyre,</hi> and <hi>Seyne,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending ſhortly to ſee face to face the army of the rebels, conducted by the Duke <hi>de Mayne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> greatly iniuried and offended ſo often, and at the requeſt, and for the pleaſure of the Duke of <hi>Guyze</hi> aſſaulted, now commeth to reſcue out of danger captiuity and death, him that had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted him ſo long with all the forces of a mighty kingdome, he commeth (I ſay) with a choſen army, not onely great in number, but alſo in valour: ſo that euery common ſouldier might haue ſupplyed the roome of an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer.</p>
               <p>Goe on O great King, put on the armor of God, &amp; follow his calling, this day thou haſt obtayned a greater and more famous victory, then at the day of <hi>Coutras,</hi> in ouercomming the deſire of reuengement, which vpon diuers occaſions might haue riſen by the frailty of mans nature.</p>
               <p>The 21<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> hauing paſſed ouer the riuer <hi>Loyre,</hi> and ioyned with his forces, gathered out of the Countreys aboueſayd, ſetteth forth a declaration, ſhewing the cauſes of this paſſage.</p>
               <p>Firſt, hee ſheweth that hee is called to enter into this action by God, by nature, by the lawe, and by the iuſt approbation of his Prince, which cauſes do moue him to determine to imploy his lyfe, his meanes &amp; power, for the reeſtabliſhing of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Kings authority, reſtoring of the realm, and for the defence of good Subiects within the ſame decayed, and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the treaſons of the Leaguers, vnder the colour of godlines and iuſtice.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he proteſteth to hold for enemies onely them, who haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared themſelues enemies of the realm by theyr rebellion, and outragious inſolencies committed againſt the ſoueraigne magiſtrate and iuſtice: pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing notwithſtanding to receaue to mercy them, which (deceaued by the enticements of the rebels, or feare) rather then by their owne malice haue aſſociat themſelues to the ſaid rebels.</p>
               <p>Denounceth therfore to all Prouinces, Cities, Commonalties, Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Nobles, Magiſtrates, Captaynes, Souldiers, Borgeſes, Citizens, and all other of any degree whatſoeuer, to retire ſpeedily from the ſociety of thoſe traitors and rebels, and to returne vnder the obedience of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall and lawful Prince and King: but ſpecially willeth the Church men (whereof ſome haue rendered themſelues inſtruments of the former trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheries and rebellions) to loue peace, and to keepe themſelues within their bounds, returning and abiding vnder the obedience of their King.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, he proteſteth that this his paſſing the riuer of <hi>Loyre</hi> (by the commaundement of the King) is for their defence, and therefore taketh all
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:8966:200"/>
the Kings faithful ſubiects vnder his protection, but ſpecially the Church men, forbidding vpon payne of death all his Captaynes and ſouldiers not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1589. Aprill"/> to proffer any iniury vnto any of them, their goods or places of exerciſes, willing alſo all the aforeſaid perſons to repayre vnto the king, or vnto him, to haue and receaue paſporte, and protections, that the faythfull may be diſcerned from the Rebell.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, he turneth his ſpeach to the foreſaid perſons, admoniſhing them to conſider the horrible euils which haue already and ſhall riſe out of that damnable rebellion. To the Cleargy hee ſpeaketh, to conſider how godlines is euery where choked in the middeſt of thoſe tumults, the name of God blaſphemed, and religion deſpiſed.</p>
               <p>The Noble men he prayeth to conſider how theyr order muſt needs fall, with the ruine of the King, Crowne, and Eſtate.</p>
               <p>The Magiſtrates hee warneth to repreſent before their eyes what exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable violating of iuſtice will follow, by the examples of the Parliaments of <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Tholouſe,</hi> carried away Priſoners as in a triumph by raſcals, and vilanous perſons.</p>
               <p>The commons hee aduertiſeth to thinke how they are eaſed by theſe tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multes, where their goods are expoſed to the pray of the vileſt ſort, their traffike interrupted, their huſbandrie altogether turned into waſt, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all, he exhorteth all men to endeuour themſelues to bring what they can to remedy theſe euils, which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rebels haue procured to the realme, which cannot be done without a good peace, neither can that be obtayned, but by the returning vnder the Kings obedience, reſtoring his royall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and reeſtabliſhing of iuſtice: hee aſſureth himſelfe that God who geueth ſaluation vnto Kinges, will aſſiſt him in this enterpriſe and iuſt cauſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Auuergne</hi> is a Prouince in <hi>France,</hi> full of hilles and mountains, wherein there be three Cityes, ſituated in forme of a triangle, and not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant farre one from another, to wit, <hi>Rion, Clermont,</hi> and <hi>Monferrant:</hi> the Kings long before had eſtabliſhed at <hi>Rion,</hi> beſide other courts, a ſoueraigne court of his treaſurers, &amp; receauers. This Citie had receaued the League, and had committed rebellion agaynſt him, in ſhaking off the yoke of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Therefore the King about the 24. of April, ſeeing their obſtinacy in their rebellion, do reuoke from the ſaid Towne of <hi>Rion</hi> all his courts, and doth tranſport the ſame to the Citie of <hi>Clermont,</hi> commaunding all his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of al his courts in that citty, to repaire to the ſaid <hi>Clermont,</hi> and there to execute their charge.</p>
               <p>About the ſame time alſo the King doth adiudge all the goods of the Dukes of <hi>Mayne, Aumale,</hi> and of the <hi>Cheualier Aumale,</hi> and of the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary inhabitants of the cities of <hi>Paris, Roen, Amiens, Abeuile, Rhemes,</hi>

               <p>The King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> in the meane time ſcoureth the countrey, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth himſelfe to receaue the Kings commaundement: and vnderſtanding that the Duke <hi>de Mayne</hi> was lodged at <hi>Vendoſme,</hi> and <hi>Montoyre,</hi> the 28. of Aprill he determined to ſurprize ſome of the enemies, and about foure a clock in the morning, taking eight hundered horſemen, and one thouſand ſhot on horſbacke, went to bait at <hi>Chaulx</hi> in <hi>Anjou,</hi> ten long leagues from <hi>Saumour:</hi> departing thence, &amp; hauing already gone forward three leagues, he receaued newes how the Duke of <hi>Mayne</hi> had brought his forces to <hi>Chasteaurenault,</hi> and had ſent part of them to beſiege the County of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enne,</hi> who was at Saint <hi>Oyne,</hi> nigh <hi>Amboyſe.</hi>

The King vnderſtanding of his being ſo nigh him, did greatly reioyce, knowing that the enemy neither would nor durſt enterprize any thing whileſt he was ſo nigh his perſon.</p>
               <p>The enemy ſent certayne companies in the euening with a great bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uade, and tooke a Suburbe of <hi>Tours,</hi> where they defloured a Mayd, who had fled into the Church before the high alter, &amp; in the armes of a Prieſt: but hearing that the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> was at hand (without any leaſure to take breath) they retyred preſently.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> reſted himſelfe and his troupes the next day, but the 30. of Aprill (beeing the Lords day) in the morning, the ſayd King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> iudging that it were neceſſary for them both to ſee one another, thereuppon to take ſome certayne reſolution of their affayres, beeing alſo requeſted by the King (although his counſell had diuers opinions of that interuiew) hee ſent to the King by the Lord of <hi>Mignouuile,</hi> that he was gone to ſet all his troupes in battaile array at the <hi>Pont la Mot,</hi> a quarterr of a league from <hi>Tours,</hi> and thatif it ſhould pleaſe his Maieſty to come to the Suburbs, he would kiſſe his Maieſties hands, and would receaue his commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts to execute the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The ſame day, the ſaid King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> obtained of the King, for them of <hi>Sedan</hi> ten thouſand Crownes for to helpe them in their affaires, with letters written vnto the Duke of <hi>Lorreyne,</hi> commaunding him to make warre no longer vppon <hi>Sedan,</hi> declaring that they were vnder his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection.</p>
               <p>Whileſt theſe things were a dooing at <hi>Tours,</hi> the Duke <hi>d' Mayne</hi> did batter <hi>Chasteaurenault;</hi> but vnderſtanding of the interuiew of the two Kings, at the ſelfe ſame houre of the interuiew hée brake the ſiege, and in haſte retired to <hi>Vendoſme.</hi> The King as is before ſaid, ſtoode in great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, to be either murdered or elſe deliuered to the enemy, by the intelligence which the Duke <hi>d' Mayne</hi> had with ſome traitours which were of his counſell in the Court and in the Citie. Now by this bleſſed reconſiliation, here is a great change to bée ſéene on a ſuddaine; for by this, the King is put out of feare, liueth out of danger of the rebels, is fortified by ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uall of this mighty Prince and army vnlooked for; the hearts of all good ſubiects are herewith encouraged, and the conſpiratours are terrified: for the Duke of <hi>Mayne</hi> being at <hi>Vendoſme,</hi> and in the territory there abouts, with a mighty army of traitors, had committed ſuch inſolencies vppon the people of their owne League and vnion, that the countrey was repleniſhed with outcries, curſes, and imprecations. Feare therfore of the King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarre,</hi> and of ſome inſurrection of the people of the countrey, conſtrained him firſt to place part of his army in gariſons, in the townes of <hi>Beauſſe, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jou, Mayne,</hi> and <hi>Perche,</hi> to make hauock of all that he left behind, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to returne to <hi>Paris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Duke <hi>d' Mayne</hi> hauing ſo deuided his army, with one part of the ſame, giueth to himſelfe many alarum in that retire to <hi>Paris.</hi>

Firſt, in publication of the ſame truce, the King with a long diſcourſe doth proteſt of his conſiancy in the Catholick religion, and oppoſeth the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1589. Aprill"/> proofes which he hath ſhewed from his youth vp, as well in his priuat pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion and exerciſes, as in purſuing the contrary religion by all meanes, and reſtabliſhing the ſaid romiſh religion, in places where it had béene aboliſhed, againſt the calumnies, falſe reports, and ſlaunders of the Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guers.</p>
               <p>On the contrarie, ſheweth how his enemies haue taken the pretence of religion, and diſcharging the people of ſundry exactions, to make aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations to ſtrengthen themſelues, to repleniſh the realme with tumults and confuſions: whereby they haue giuen opportunity to the heretickes, to aboliſh the Catholik religion, and to enlarge theirs, and they themſelues haue by ſundry cruelties and extortions, oppreſſed his ſubiects of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick religion: he complaineth that the Leaguers hauing attempted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his perſon, and proclaymed an open war againſt him and his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, who through their iniuries, haue enforced him to call the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> to his naturall and lawfull defence, againſt their rebellions and treaſons.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he declareth how the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> acknowledging his duty toward his Maieſty, and pittying the miſerable ſtate of the realme, ſubuerted &amp; brought to a lamentable confuſion by the Leaguers, hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly required peace of him. Whereupon by the aduiſe of the Princes of the bloud, officers of the Crowne, and Lords of his Counſell, he hath concluded a truce; and ceaſing from all hoſtility throughout the whole tralme, therein comprehending the County of <hi>Veniſſe,</hi> and ſtate of <hi>Auig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> belonging to the Pope, the ſaid truce to begin the third day of Aprill, and to continue a whole yeare.</p>
               <p>The conditions of the ſaid truce are as followeth.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> ſhall not, during the time of the ſaid truce, employ his forces within, nor without the realme, but for his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, and at his commaundement and direction.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that whereſoeuer the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> ſhall come, he ſhall alter, change, nor innouat, nor interrupt the exerciſe of the romiſh religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor ſhew any diſpleaſure to the Prieſts, nor to the places of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotions.</p>

               <p>Laſt of all, the King graunteth to them of the reformed religion, the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of their conſciences whereſoeuer, within his dominions, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of the ſame in places were it was exerciſed at the time of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding of this truce: alſo that they all ſhall enioy their goods whereſoeuer,

               <p>This was proclaymed and recorded in Parliament the thirtie day of Aprill at <hi>Tours</hi> the day of theyr interuiewe.</p>
               <p>About the ſame time in like manner, the king of <hi>Nauarre</hi> did ſet foorth a declaration of the cauſes of theſe truces: wherein firſt he doth proteſt, that in all theſe ciuill warres, he hath armed himſelfe and his friendes againſt his will, nature and neceſſitie en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>orcing him ſo to doe, and ſheweth that his warre of the League began vnder a pretence and ſhadow of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but in very deede is found a war of eſtate. Proteſteth that his great deſire hath beene alwayes to doe ſome good and acceptable ſeruice to the king. Complayneth of the malice of his enemies, diſguiſed and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured with fauourable pretences to ouerthrow the State. Commendeth the king, who at length hath with a good iudgement diſcerned his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie from their malice, through ſo great and thick miſt of colours and calomnies of his enemies.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he ſheweth that the Leaguers making the world beleeue to warre againſt the reformed religion, whome they doe cal heretikes, neuer went to ſeeke them out where they were, but abuſing of the kings autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and power, which they had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Thirdly, he ſheweth that they haue not vſed their preachers and Ieſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites to conuert the pretended hereticks as they ſhould haue done, but in all places where they haue borne the ſway, haue made them ſerue for trompets of ſedition and firebrands, to ſound the alarum, and to ſet the whole Realme on a fire, and miſerable combuſtion, to rayſe the ſubiects a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their prince, to ſeduce them from the obedience of their magiſtrats, to diſpoſe them to tumults, alteration and noueities, whereby they haue procured an horrible deformitie in the Realme, a generall and incredible rebellion, by the which they haue baniſhed all pietie and iuſtice out of all Cities and places which are vnder their tyranny.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, he ſheweth the cauſes of this their reconſiliation and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiew, to haue been no reſpect of religion at all: But that he for his parte pitying the miſerable ſtate wherunto the enemies had reduced the realm, when he mought haue vſed the publike calamities of the ſaide ſtate for to doe well and aſſure his affayres, forgiuing all iniuries and diſcurteſies receaued vnto the realme, hath offered to the king his life, and meanes to aſſiſt him to reſtabliſh his authoritie: which proffers the king of his cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentie and goodnes accepted. And vpon that acceptation (that hee might the better haue meanes to doo him good ſeruice) the ſayd King bath conciu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a generall truce throughout all his Dominions for a whole yeare, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding

               </p>
               <p>Laſt of all, hee chargeth and commandeth all them of his ſide and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1589. Aprill"/> to keepe the conditions of this truee inuiolable, forbidding them to enterpriſe, innouate, or alter any thing either in religion or policie, in any place of the Kings dominions.</p>
               <p>And as the King of his gracious goodnes had giuen libertie to them of the reformed religion, to enioy the freedome of their conſciences &amp; goods, he willeth alſo the like libertie to bee giuen to the Catholikes, who are in the Prouinces, Townes or Cities, holden by them of the reformed reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, ſo long as this truce ſhall endure.</p>
               <p>Among all other Prouinces, which through rebellion had forſaken the Kings obedience, <hi>Picardy</hi> and the Ile of <hi>France</hi> had waded moſt déepely in that rebellion, hauing generally reuolted, <hi>Calis</hi> and <hi>Boloigne</hi> excepted.

               <p>About the beginning of Aprill, the Lord <hi>Thore</hi> of the houſe of <hi>Mom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morency,</hi> went vp and downe in the Towne of <hi>Seulis,</hi> conferring with the good and faithfull inhabitants of the ſayd Towne, who with his good and graue reaſons reduced them to the Kings obedience.</p>

This he did, not that the place was of any ſuch ſtrength, but repoſing his truſt in God, who is a defender of a iuſt cauſe, and in the courage &amp; faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes of the inhabitants and ſouldiers there. The Pariſiens amazed to ſee the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Lord of <hi>Mayneuile</hi> (whom wee haue ſayd the Duke <hi>de Mayne</hi> had left gouernour of <hi>Paris)</hi> in great haſt with a company of Pariſiens well armed, came to beſiege the ſayd Towne of <hi>Seulis.</hi> The Duke <hi>d'Aumale</hi> with a braue companie of horſemen and a ſort of footemen, arriued inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently there after the Lord <hi>Mayneuile;</hi> ſo that on a ſodaine they beſieged the Towne, being at the daſh to the number of foure thouſand men.</p>
               <p>The fourth day, the Pariſiens and other partakers and fellowes of the vnion, came poſting from many places, being well horſed and furniſhed, and found themſelues that day before that Towne to the number of ſixe

thouſand men.</p>
               <p>The fift day they ſent to <hi>Paris</hi> for Ordinance, whereof three were ſent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1589. May"/> them, to wit, two Canons and one Culuerine: and becauſe none would enterpriſe to conduct the ſayd Ordinance, this way was deuiſed.</p>
               <p>In the alteration which was made in the Citie in Ianuary laſt, they had appoynted a Captain for euery warde of the Citie, which be eightéen, which by turnes ſhould haue out of his warde twelue hundred men, to march to the <hi>Boys</hi> of <hi>Vicennes</hi> nigh <hi>Paris,</hi> to keepe that Caſtle from ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing by the Kings friends.

                  </gap>eces at <hi>Seulis</hi> the ſixt day of May in the euening. At their arriuing they ſaluted the Towne with a peale of that Ordinance.</p>
               <p>At the noyſe therof, they of the Towne on a ſudden came to the Towne walles, and offered to make as great a breach in the wall as they would demaund, and ſo to eaſe them from taking ſo much paynes as to vſe the Canon ſhot.</p>
               <p>The Duke <hi>d'Aumale</hi> preſently ſent to ſummon them to yeeld vnto compoſition: they within promiſed to make an anſwere the morrowe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
               <p>Vpon this anſwere, a Poſt of the Towne went to <hi>Paris</hi> to bring them good newes, which encreaſed greatly by the way, as the manner is: there the report went that <hi>Seulis</hi> had proffered thréeſcore thouſand Crownes, ſome multiplied that to one hundered thouſand, for their rau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The 7. day, they of the Towne gaue their anſwere both by portraiture and by mouth: for they all night had portrayed on a cloath the Dukes <hi>de Mayn</hi> &amp; <hi>Aumale</hi> hanged on gibbets, &amp; the Dutcheſſe <hi>Montpenſier</hi> knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at the feete of them with her head all vncouered, weeping and wailing and tearing her haire, which they cauſed to be ſet on the morrow (being the 7. of May) to bee ſpread vpon the walles, the people crying with vile and reproachful ſpeaches, that the ſame was the portraiture of the compoſition that they demaunded.</p>
               <p>Vpon the ſight of this picture, and words ſpoken out of the wall: they ſent agayne to <hi>Paris</hi> for more Ordinance, to beat the Towne to duſt, for they had ſworne ſo to doo.</p>
               <p>The Pariſiens made excuſe, that they lacked Bullets, and ſuch Pieces as they demaunded.</p>
               <p>The cauſe of this excuſe was not lacke of will to do ſo much miſchiefe
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:8966:204"/>
as the other intended to haue done: but for feare of the ielouſies betweene the Duke <hi>de Mayne</hi> and <hi>Aumale:</hi> for the Duke <hi>Aumale</hi> had béen great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1589. May"/> and oftentimes deſired (after his departure from thence) to returne to <hi>Paris,</hi> which he denyed to doo. The Pariſiens therefore fearing that <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male</hi> hauing ſuch forces as hee had at <hi>Seulis,</hi> and expected dayly from the Lord <hi>Balagny,</hi> and hauing ſtore of Ordinance and munition, either might turne all theſe forces agaynſt them, or keepe them ſhort from hauing any victuals out of <hi>Picardie,</hi> or to make a third faction, and to ſtriue with the Duke <hi>de Mayne</hi> about the ſtate, and ſo weaken their party, to expoſe them to be a pray for the King.</p>
               <p>The Duke <hi>d' Aumale,</hi> ſeeing that there was little ſuccour to bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from <hi>Paris,</hi> ſent to <hi>Peronne,</hi> where he had ſixe pieces of Ordinance, and out of <hi>Anjous</hi> one, which were conducted to <hi>Seulis</hi> by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord <hi>Balag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> gouernour of <hi>Cambray.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About the 13. day of May they of <hi>Seulis</hi> made a ſally out of the Towne with a hundered horſemen, whereat they that beſieged the towne were ſo amaſed, that they thought beſt to flee: ſo the Pariſiens caſting away their armor, fled, and hid themſelues in buſhes on euery ſide.</p>
               <p>Of theſe hundered horſemen, fiftie returned into the towne, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fifty kept the field, for to ayde any that might come to ſuccour them.</p>
               <p>About the 15. of May, the Lord <hi>Balagny</hi> with his companies of Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons, Cambreſines and Picardines, came and ioyned to the D. <hi>Aumale,</hi> with ſixe pieces of Ordinance, which hee had taken at <hi>Peronne</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jous,</hi> as is aforeſayd.</p>
               <p>The 12. day of May, they began to batter <hi>Seulis,</hi> with ten pieces of bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, and within a while hauing made a great breach, the enemy confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly gaue the aſſault, who was repulſed with ſome loſſe.</p>
               <p>The ſame day about noone, word came to the enemy that the Duke of <hi>Longueuille,</hi> accompanied with the Lordes of <hi>Humieres, Bonniuet, la Nowe, Giury, Meſuiller,</hi> and <hi>Tour,</hi> and other nobles of <hi>Picardy</hi> were at hand to the number of a thouſand horſemen, and three thouſand footmen to reſcue the towne of <hi>Seulis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereupon the Lord <hi>Balagny</hi> pitched in campe the beſt power of his men, and beeing then accompanied with the Lords of <hi>Mainuile,</hi> of <hi>Saiſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual, Mezieres,</hi> and <hi>Congy,</hi> with others, approched ſomewhat neere to the Duke of <hi>Longueuille,</hi> in good hope to diſcomfit him. The horſemen of <hi>Cambray,</hi> and the Wallons alſo firſt charged the footmen of the Duke of <hi>Longueuille.</hi> The ſaid footmen departed themſelues in the middle, &amp; gaue roome for the ordinance to ſhoot: which at the firſt volye made a great flaughter of the Cambreſines and Wallons, who lyking not that play, recyred backe with greater haſt then they went to it: but afterward they came all to a ſet battaile, fought ſtoutly on both ſydes, and with great cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage:
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:8966:204"/>
but the Ordinance of the Duke of <hi>Longueuille</hi> made ſtill ſo great ſpoite of the enemy, that conceauing a great dread they began to wauer, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1589. May"/> neither could the Duke <hi>d' Aumale,</hi> nor the Lord <hi>Balagny</hi> by any perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions encourage them, nor bring them to good order agayne: ſo the confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and terror encreaſing, the whole army which beſieged the towne, fled away preſently.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Longueuille</hi> his power, with the power which was in the Towne, iſſuing forth, did ſo follow the chaſe, that with handy blowes they killed as many as they could ouertake. There remayned ſlayne of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels vpon the place betweene fifteene hundred and two thouſand, as many were ſlaine in the chaſe, beſides them who were ſlayne in the Villages by the countrey people. All the Ordinance and munition of warre, bagge &amp; baggage was left behind. The Duke <hi>d' Aumale</hi> had a blow which did him no good, the Lord <hi>Balagny</hi> had an other which did him no great hurt: hoth of them fled to <hi>Paris</hi> in leſſer company then when they went to <hi>Seulis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Duke <hi>d' Aumale</hi> the 19. of May went out of <hi>Paris,</hi> fearing there to be welome, and miſtruſting the ſnares of <hi>de Mayne,</hi> mutiny and fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Pariſiens, he retyred to Saint <hi>Denis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Balagny</hi> remayned in <hi>Paris,</hi> faining there that hee would take order for the gathering of the Souldiers, breathing out cruell threatning what hee would doo, and promiſing to the Pariſiens, that a new ſupply of Wallons would come out of the low Countrey: he cheareth the people of <hi>Paris,</hi> who were ſmitten with the dread of <hi>Iericho.</hi> The ſelfe ſame day, the rebels of <hi>Rion</hi> in <hi>Auuergne,</hi> had an ouerthrow no leſſe then this, but the particulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes are not knowen vnto me for lacke of inſtructions.</p>

               <p>Secondly, aduiſeth them to conſider the cauſes of their rebellion to bee in themſelues, and not in other men: for it cannot be for any religion, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny violence, or neceſſitie which hath enforced them thereunto; but a wicked and raſh minde, which maketh them pretend a feare of ſome euill that may come hereafter: and ſo doing they make themſelues vnfortunate, and caſt themſelues in a miſerable ſtate. And in preuenting a fault that may bée hereafter, they doo commit a manifeſt and heynous crime: in going about to ſtop an euill, which they doo imagine to ſee a farre of, they doo procure to themſelues innumerable euils: to aſſure a libertie to their children, which no man will hinder, they doo throwe themſelues into a preſent bondage: To make ſure (as they ſay) their ſtate and goods, they yéeld themſelues to be ſpoyled and robbed.</p>
               <p>Put them in remembrance of the calamities which will accompanie their rebellion and their obſtinacie in the ſame, as that they doo drawe a cruell warre to their gates, whereby they ſhall be continually in feare and alarume; by it they ſhall haue need continually of an armie to gard them; by it they ſhall ſee their houſes, their fieldes, their vines ſet on a fire, their wiues and children ſpoyled, their traffique ſtopped, their huſbandrie wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted: and all this they are like to ſuffer for going about to reuenge another mans naughtie quarrell, and for to make their backes to be footſteps for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men to get vp vnto the ſcaffold of their ambition: which if it doth fall
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:8966:206"/>
(as it cannot ſtand) it will quaile, ſtiffle and vndo them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, admoniſheth them to call to remembrance the fidelitie and loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1589.

               <p>Laſt of all, hee aſſureth them of the Kings clemencie and gracious fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, and proffereth them his meanes to further the ſame, if they will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne vnder his obedience.</p>
               <p>Afterward the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> ſcoured all the countrey of <hi>Beauſſe,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing enforced the rebels to keepe in their Holds.</p>
               <p>At length the King hauing receaued certaine regiments of Swiſſers, and encouraged with theſe good beginnings againſt the rebels, (knowing the God of battailes to be of his ſide) in the latter ende of Iune gatheres all his forces together, and came in perſon to his Campe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Helpe commeth to him from all parts of the Realme, his armie encreaſeth daily in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, fame and power. The ſtate of the King thus ſuddenly, many Cities begin to entreate vpon peace.</p>
               <p>Thus the King hauing recouered part of his authoritie, and in good hope to recouer the whole, and more then euer he had, by refuſing the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of ſtrangers, and following the good, wiſe, ſage, and diſcreet counſell of the Princes of his bloud, and other his noble and faithfull counſellers, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects and friends; he marcheth directly toward <hi>Paris</hi> to begin the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where this vnthankfulnes, treacherie and rebellion had begun. He taketh <hi>Pontoys,</hi> S. <hi>Clow,</hi> ſeazeth vppon <hi>Poiſſy,</hi> S. <hi>Germayne, Charanton,</hi> and other Townes round about <hi>Paris. Meloune</hi> and <hi>Corbeil</hi> he had forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and holden euer ſince the beginning of the rebellion.</p>
               <p>The Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> ſent Ambaſſadours vnto him, doo wiſh him well, doo proffer him money and men to repreſſe that barbarous <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Iune"/> treacherie of his enemies. Some of the firſt conſpirators alſo through diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payre, flee vnto his mercie. Finally, all things now fall contrary to their expectation and traiterous deſires, without any hope to looke any more (ſo long as the King liueth) for any condition of agreement or ſuretie of life. To be ſhort, the caſe is altered.</p>
               <p>For the King leading his power nigh <hi>Paris,</hi> to compaſſe it round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, and hauing all the Townes about, beginneth ſo to diſtreſſe it, that either none or ſmall ſtore of victuals could be brought into the Citie.</p>
               <p>The conſpirators begin to tremble at this newe and ſudden chaunge: therefore the heads of the traitors ſeeing themſelues ſo hardly beſet, doo enter into counſell to determine vppon the extremitie of their affayres. One among the reſt declared the daunger wherein they liued; he ſhewed that the mindes of the Nobilitie were mutable and inconſtant, fawning
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:8966:207"/>
alwayes on Fortunes ſide. He ſhewed alſo that the fearefull Cities could not be kept faithfull vnto them, and that vppon the ſight of any imminent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1589. Iune"/> danger, they would be ready to reuolt agayne to the King.</p>
               <p>Alſo hee diſcourſed how the Cleargie were couetous, and neuer gaue but very little of their owne to their Kings, and therefore there was ſmall hope that they would giue to them who might but intreat for it. And thus ſtood their caſe at home.</p>
               <p>From abroade (ſayd he) leſſe hope was to bee looked for: for the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyard was olde and carefull for the quietnes of his owne familie, vnto whom it was more ſecuritie that <hi>France</hi> ſhould bee troubled, then vſurped by any other then himſelfe.</p>
               <p>The Italian Princes are circumſpect and wiſe.</p>
               <p>The Germanes are couetous and miſers.</p>
               <p>The Pope is ſubtill, craftie and inconſtant, gréedie for his owne gayne, and turning with euery blaſt of fortune: therefore he concluded, that there was none other remedie remayning for them but to dye or runne away, except one thing could bee brought to paſſe, to wit, the death of the King, which (if they would auoyde their aſſured vndoing) was to be laboured by all meanes poſſible, and that there was no other remedie for redreſſe of their diſtreſſed eſtate.</p>
               <p>In this counſell ſat the Duke <hi>de Mayne</hi> (as a King in hope) <hi>Aumale, Nemours,</hi> the treacherous Biſhop of <hi>Lions,</hi> whom the King a little before had pardoned and ſet at libertie, the Lords <hi>Roſne, Boyſdaulphin, Briſſak, Sagonne,</hi> the 47. choſen for the counſell of the Citie, as aboue ſayd, the ſeuentéene Colonels appoynted ouer the eightéene wardes of the Citie.</p>
               <p>All this bleſſed company hauing heard the diſcourſe aboue ſayd, and ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with their eyes vengeance to be at the doore, concluded the condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and execution of the King ſpeedily to bee diſpatched and murthered, but the meanes are found very difficult to bring ſuch a famous act to paſſe. Now therefore they muſt ſearch out ſome way to bring ſuch a bold and daungerous enterpriſe to poſſibilitie: he that ſhall happily vndertake that feate, ought to bee willing, bold, ſturdie and quicke handed, and a man ſo qualified, that without any ſuſpition may haue a ſpeedie and ſure acceſſe to the Kings perſon. Many offered themſelues to be the executioners of that vilanous act. But it was conſidered that they could not paſſe through ſo many gards and doores without ſuſpition, which if they ſhould bee taken, by torments they would be made coufeſſe the matter, and that would be a ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eat to him to looke more diligently to himſelfe, which would bring the matter to impoſſibilitie.</p>
               <p>Many are ſolicited thereunto by great and fayre promiſes, and lacked no good will, but onely courage. But aduiſing themſelues of the Kings more then ſuperſticious heart, concluded to make choyſe of ſome ſaucie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperat

               </p>
               <p>To ſpie out ſuch a one as would vndertake to atchieue ſuch a deſperate parricide, was committed ſpecially to one <hi>Pichnard</hi> an inceſtuous &amp; moſt vilanous perſon. This <hi>Pichnard</hi> therefore to giue ſome good grace to this tragedie, brought in a Frier to play the diuels part, &amp; ſuch a one as might at all times aſſure himſelfe of free acceſſe. And for as much as among all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſects of idolatrous Friers, the Dominicans were moſt welcome to the King, he made his choyſe of one of that order for the determined exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, as ſhall hereafter be declared.</p>
               <p>But we will by a digreſſion ſhewe the holines of that order of Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nican Friers and others, that it may appeare that it is not newe nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary vnto Frierie and Monkerie to bee hold, readie and ſtrong to commit all vilanie.</p>
               <p>All about one time out of the bottomleſſe pit of hell (by a iuſt iudgement of God to reuenge the vnthankfulnes and idolatries of the world, and to fill the meaſure of iniquitie of the ſpirituall Sodome by Antichriſt) there iſſued two frogges with lying ſpirits to ſeduce vtterly the world, to wit, <hi>Francis</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> and <hi>Dominick</hi> in <hi>Spayne,</hi> two miſbegotten monſters in all reſpects one like to another, ſaue onely in their haire and king of francie.</p>
               <p>Theſe two ſeducers like in hypocriſie, ignorance, ſuperſtition, idolatrie and rage, were poſſeſſed with diuers ſpirits of francie. For <hi>Francis</hi> was a franticke ſot, ignorance it ſelfe, made onely to make the world laugh with his follies, and yet by his follies (ſuch was that accurſed age) he gat him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe a great fame and reputation of holineſſe, and drewe after him an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite number of diſciples of the like humour to his.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dominick</hi> in <hi>Spayne</hi> was of a hotter francie, ſo that it may bee ſayd of him as of <hi>Caligula, vrceus conflatus ex luto &amp; ſanguine, immanitate opple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus.</hi> For his owne Friers doo write of him, that whileſt he was in his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wombe, ſhe dreamed that ſhe was deliuered of a Dogge that held a burning Torch, wherewith he kindled a fire in the world and ſet it to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtion.

Diamonds mingled in his challice, when they did miniſter to him ſuch a communion as they had deuiſed of their owne. For that cauſe onely that the good Emperour wiſhed, &amp; had ſome ſpeaches about the reforming of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1589. Iulie"/> Church.</p>
               <p>But the accurſed rage of the Inquiſition (which doth conſiſt moſt of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minican Fryers) hath ſo farre ſurpaſſed all the tyrants that euer were, that O yee <hi>Buſiris, Perillus, Phalaris, Nero, Caligula, Domitian, Helio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabalus,</hi> and thou vnnaturall houſe of <hi>Otheman,</hi> and yee that are famous for any notorious wickednes, reioyce, for your infamy is iuſtified by the raging cruelty of theſe Atheiſtes, Sorcerers, Negromancers, Idolaters, Enchaunters and Parricides, the accurſed Dominican Fryers, and the whole rabble of Friery and Monkery, againſt the Church and Chriſtian Princes.</p>
               <p>I leaue off the hipocriſy, enchauntments and ſorceries, which theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions played at <hi>Berna</hi> and <hi>Orleans:</hi> no maruaile therefore if wee heare neuer a pleaſant tale, but of the deedes of Friers: wee neuer laugh but at theyr follies; we neuer wonder but at their impudency; we are neuer aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed but at their furie; we neuer tremble but at their rage; we neuer ſee a mery play, but a Frier playeth the Deuils part. <hi>Pichnard</hi> therefore conſidering all things, as is aforeſaid, thought good to pick out ſuch a one as was brought vp in <hi>Dominiks</hi> ſchoole, well practiſed and exerciſed in the affaiers of their order. Whereuppon he ſolicited one <hi>Iames Clement,</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther S. <hi>Dominicke</hi> in all reſpects, in ignorance exceeding, ſo that he knew no more then his <hi>Portiforia,</hi> ſuch a one as for his lewdnes, and for beeing taken often tymes in ſtewes and whorehouſes, had béen by the order of their diſcipline diuerſly puniſhed.</p>
               <p>This Frier <hi>Iames</hi> was in great fauour before with the lady <hi>Montpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cier,</hi> ſiſter to the late Duke of <hi>Guyze,</hi> being her confeſſor, not for any good quallity in him, but becauſe hee was a luſty ſturdy ghoſtly father among Ladies of her religion, &amp; could giue her ſuch good counſell as could pleaſe her well.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pichnard</hi> perceaued this companion to bee a fit inſtrument to execute their damnable and deuiliſh ſentence, made motion of the matter to him. The Frier, although very deſirous of the Kings death, yet willing that it ſhould be done rather by another then by himſelfe, feared to thruſt himſelfe into that aſſured danger of a preſent death, was vnwilling to heare any more of that.</p>
               <p>Fryer <hi>Iames</hi> is called in. There were the Dukes <hi>de Mayne, Aumale, Nemours,</hi> the Lordes <hi>Roſne, Sagonne, Briſſak, Boyſdaulphin, Villeroy,</hi> and ſuch good Catholikes, and to fill the meſſe there was <hi>Pagarola,</hi> Fryer <hi>Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> his Chaplaine, a very louing Prieſt, and one that can write very lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing letters to the Curtiſans of <hi>Rome,</hi> to giue them ſuch ſpirituall coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:8966:208"/>
as he can ſkill. They had (poore ſilly Frier) <hi>Iames Clement</hi> vnder be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedicite: there they ſhewed to this accurſed parricide what a good deed he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1589. Iulie"/> might doo to deliuer holy Church from the tiranny of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, who was become an heretike, and that with one blow hee might procure peace to the whole realme, and a bleſſed quietnes to the holy Church.</p>
               <p>They ſhewed vnto him, how his order had done many times ſuch good ſeruice to holy Church, as in ridding away the Emperour <hi>Henry</hi> the 7. who intended to perſecute holy Church.</p>
               <p>They let him vnderſtand, how among all other order of Friers, his had deſerued the greateſt praiſe in ſpilling daily the bloud of heretikes as wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the townes, and citties of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and <hi>Jtaly,</hi> and all for the honor of God and exaltation of holy Church. But this pinch would be the nobleſt act that euer was done by any man: the rememberance thereof ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine for euer, and his name ſhould be made immortall thereby, and if he ſhould die, he ſhould dye a glorious Martir, as <hi>Thomas Becket</hi> did in England.</p>
               <p>Afterwad he was brought to the Ladies, catholike and chaſt women, the Ducheſſes of <hi>Montpencier, Guyze, Aumale, Nemours, Foyeuſe,</hi> the mother and the holy Virgin the Ladie Saint <hi>Beufue,</hi> who as a ſpeciall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour had beſtowed the pockes of late vpon the Duke <hi>de Mayne,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide diuers of the principall leaguers in the time of her Virginitie. This Lady is of ſuch holynes, that ſhee is neither a maide, nor wife, nor widow: in this company were <hi>Thais, Lais</hi> and <hi>Bacchis</hi> of <hi>Corinthus,</hi> all holy Catholike women. They began to ſhriue the Frier, if they were men, or if they could be ſo tranſformed into men, that they might haue acceſſe to the tirant, they could finde in their harts to ſtabbe him: that is a ſpeciall point of honor which they do proffer him to doo ſuch a famous deed. It is hereditarie to his order to exalt the Church, and to deliuer it, hee is a man endued with ſtrength, they haue béen his good Ladies, they haue fauoured him greatly and pleaſured him in any thing that euer he requeſted. What, will hee not do ſo much at their requeſt: they muſt die all, and all the citie of <hi>Paris;</hi> what a good deede it is to ſaue the liues of Princeſſes, Ladies, good Citizens, deuout Prieſts and religious men of ſo many innocents, whoſe death the tirant had ſworne, with the razing of the cittie. If he refuſeth to do that good deede, they thinke him not to be that man that they tooke him for.</p>
               <p>They ſhewed him how eaſy it was to performe it: for there were many Leaguers, and their partakers in his counſell, in his court, in his chamber, in his campe, in his gardes, who would aſſiſt him: and if any danger ſhould ſtirre, they would defende him and reſcue him, and that none would bee ſo hardie, as to proffer him a blowe: for elſe Frier <hi>Pagarola</hi> would fome like a boare and thunder like a deuill againſt them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="404" facs="tcp:8966:209"/>
What and if it ſhould happen, that he ſhould die for holy Church, then he ſhould be happie to deſerue the name of Martir, &amp; that his brother Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1589. Iulie"/>

               <p>But if hee returne ſafe (as hee ſhall no doubt) God forbid elſe) hee ſhall be well rewarded in money, hee ſhall haue a Biſhopricke for his paines: Frier <hi>Paugarola</hi> will procure Frier <hi>Sixtus</hi> to make him a Cardinall, for a Frier will doo for a Frier, and who knowes not that by theſe meanes hee may be made Pope, after Frier <hi>Sixtus</hi> is weary of his roome.</p>
               <p>To bee ſhort, if hee will not do it, he ſhall ſee with his eies his good La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, all his order, all the good Catholikes of the whole citty of <hi>Paris</hi> put to the ſword, the cittie razed (for the tirant hath ſworne both he ſhall die him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe an aſſured death ere it bee long) the holy Maſſe, the holy Saints, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages and relikes, the Churches ſhall all be deſtroyed, and the heretikes ſhall haue all thinges: all theſe miſchiefes cannot be auoyded but by his death.</p>
               <p>By theſe perſwaſions, the accurſed Fryer (otherwiſe ready ynough to all miſchiefe) is induced to commit one of the moſt villanous parts which euer was committed in <hi>France.</hi> So Sathan hauing poſſeſſed his hart, the Fryer perſwadeth himſelfe, that an Angell hath appeared vnto him, and commaunded him to kill the King: he opened this to another Fryer which was greatly eſteemed in <hi>Paris,</hi> by reaſon of a good opinion of great holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes which the people had of him. The other Fryer doth encourage him, promiſeth him, that by doing ſuch a holy deed, he ſhall deliuer the Church, and ſet the whole realme at quiet, baniſh warre, and reſtore a moſt aſſured and perpetuall peace, as <hi>Iudith</hi> did deliuer <hi>Betulia</hi> by the death of <hi>Holo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fern<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Behold (Chriſtian reader) the King condemned to dye, the executioner to commit the parricide ſought out by <hi>Pichenard,</hi> perſwaded by the heads of the League, and ſome Ladies belonging to them, deluded by Sathan, confirmed in this deluſion by another Frier as good as himſelfe, with aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured promiſe of a moſt ſure and conſtant peace. Frier <hi>Clement</hi> deſireth to knowe how he may doo it ſurely and ſafely.</p>
               <p>The Leaguers therefore enter into deliberation about three things, to wit, the acceſſe to the Kings perſon, the ſtroke and ſecrecie. As for the firſt poynt to conuey him to the Kings perſon, they conſidered his coate, which for the reuerence and loue which the King did beare to it, would prepare him the way.</p>
               <p>Secondly, whereas the rebels in ſeazing vpon <hi>Paris</hi> after the death of the Duke of <hi>Guize,</hi> had taken the Senate priſoner, and did as yet hold a great many priſoners, and among other the firſt Preſident of the Senate named the Preſident <hi>Harlay.</hi> They had alſo in like ſort many of the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt Citizens for bearing good will to the King, or becauſe they were rich,
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:8966:209"/>
(as is aforeſayd) whom they detayned in like manner priſoners. The ſayd Lord Preſident and ſome of the ſayd Citizens, procured to write let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1589. Iulie"/> vnto the King, which ſhould bee deliuered to Frier <hi>Iames Clement.</hi> They taught him alſo a leſſon contayning matters of importance, with commaundement that they ſhould not be diſcloſed vnto any man but vnto the King onely, and that in ſecret.</p>
               <p>As for the ſtroke, it muſt néedes bee deadly too; for els it would but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe their miſerie, and ſuch a blowe could not bee giuen but by a ſecret weapon that might bee hidden eaſily about him: for otherwiſe if it could be perceiued, it would make the King more warie hereafter and carefull of himſelfe. But what could be more fit then a knife, which might bee eaſily conueyed in the Friers ſleeue, and whoſe noyſe might not detect the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherie. But yet there was another miſchance to be preuented, for the wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of a knife might light vppon ſuch a place as could not be deadly, they finde the meanes to worke ſurely, that if he cannot kill him out of hand, yet that at length it may be his death.</p>
               <p>Therefore Frier <hi>Paugarola</hi> (Frier <hi>Sixtus</hi> his Chaplaine) muſt bleſſe the knife with ſome poulderdoribus of <hi>Rome,</hi> which ſuch men as he is doo commonly carry in ſtore for great holines among other holy reliques of <hi>Rome,</hi> hauing greater force the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their <hi>Agnus dei,</hi> or any other agios: others they haue to worke miracles, and ſuch as the maſter Frier in <hi>Rome</hi> dooth vſe to giue in a drench to his friends, when hee is wearie of their companie to make them giue roome.</p>
               <p>But becauſe ſuch waightie matters cannot bee kept ſo cloſe very long, but will vent out: therefore leaſt the ſmoake of this execrable intended parricide ſhould flee ouer the walles of <hi>Paris,</hi> and ſo by giuing intelligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, their haynous vnnaturall and helliſh treaſon and murther might bée preuented, it was diligently prouided that no man ſhould goe out of <hi>Paris</hi> before the exployt were done. Therefore the gates were ſhut vp and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully kept, and all the iſſues at the Suburbes end ſtraightly and narrowly watched, that no man could goe to tell tales out of the ſchoole.</p>
               <p>Now the Frier hath on his hypocriticall coate, his letters in his hand, his leſſon in his head, his poyſoned knife in his ſleeue, order is taken that no intelligences may be giuen, the way is made plaine before this diuelliſh murtherer, euen as farre as to the Kings gate, the doores are made open to him by theſe meanes, the execution is to bee performed ſpeedily, leaſt delay ſhould diſappoynt his enterpriſe. This murtherer accompanied with the other Frier, who had confirmed him in his reuelation or illuſion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Sathan had deluded him: (as is aforeſayd) the 21. of Iuly, which by the newe heauen of the Popes making, is the firſt of Auguſt, out of <hi>Paris</hi> taking his way to S. <hi>Clow,</hi> which is a Towne vpon <hi>Seyne</hi> beneath <hi>Paris</hi> two ſmall leagues, and comming to the Campe, he tolde them whome hée
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:8966:210"/>
met firſt, that he had letters from the firſt Preſident and certaine other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſiens well affected to the king, which contayned matters of great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1589. Iulie"/> and beſide that, hee had great and waightie things to diſcloſe to the King.</p>
               <p>The King being ſcarce ready, and aduertiſed of this accurſed Friers comming, commaunded that he ſhould attend, and that ſpeedily hee ſhould be admitted to his ſpeach: the Frier did attend with his letter in his hand, which he ſaid was from the firſt preſident detained priſoner.</p>
               <p>The King being made ready, and at ſuch an houre as he was wont to enter into his oratory, and when it was not lawfull not for the Princes of the bloud to haue acceſſe vnto him, cauſed that ſauage murtherer to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to him.</p>
               <p>The Frier came before the King with a bolde countenance, the King looking merily vpon him, ſaid theſe words; <hi>amice ad quid venisti?</hi> The Frier making a low and humble reuerence, euen to the ground, gaue the King the letter, which he ſaid came from the firſt preſident of <hi>Paris:</hi> which letters when the King had read, aſked the Frier what newes hee brought from <hi>Paris:</hi> the Frier anſwered that hee had matters of great importance to declare vnto him. Whereupon the King commaunded two Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, who waited and ſerued him at his vpriſing, to goe foorth out of the chamber, and ſat downe in a chayre, to heare what the Frier would ſay.</p>
               <p>The Frier drew nigh to the King, and falling vpon his knées, began to tell a tale: the King ſtouping ſomewhat low, to heare what the Frier was about to ſay, gaue more attendance to his words than to his fingers. The Frier drawing ſoftly his knife out of his ſléeue, ſtabbed the King there with in the lower part of the belly, and made haſt to get away.</p>
               <p>The King amazed at the ſuddaine and vnexpected ſtroak, cried out, and laying hand vpon a dagger that lay nere him, ſtroak the Frier, who partly for the blow, &amp; partly for feare, fell preſently down. Vppon this noyſe, the Lordes came running into the Kings chamber, and after many woundes ſlew that curſed Frier.</p>
               <p>Some doo report that the King commaunded that hee ſhould not bee flaine, but taken vp and examined, which declared who ſet him on, and the authors names of ſo vile treacherie: the wound was preſently dreſſed, and as the report went, ſeauen ſtitches made in it: at length the wound be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dreſſed, hee was laide on his bed, and ſlept a little vppon his paine and griefe.</p>
               <p>After his ſleepe, hee made his praiers vnto God, and with a loude voyce, made a confeſſion of his faith, and of the féeling which he had of his redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, adding there unto this feruent praier.</p>

               <p>The King hauing made an end of his praiers, ſendeth for his brother the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> and for the chiefeſt Lords of his court, gouernours and captaines, but ſpecially for the heads of the ſtrangers, to the intent that if it were Gods will that hee ſhould dye, they might knowe his laſt will.</p>
               <p>Firſt, ſpeaking to the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> commended vnto him the charge of his Realme, the gouernement of his ſubiects, the lawes of <hi>France.</hi>

               <p>To the reſt of Princes, Lords and Noblemen he ſignified, that the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſucceſſion of the royall ſtate of <hi>France,</hi> fell not to any other then to the perſon of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> and declared at that time the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> firſt ſucceſſor: he prayed and exhorted the whole company to acknowledge him, and to be faithfull vnto him, willed them alſo to proteſt in his preſence, all with one voice the acknowledging of him, and to promiſe true obedience vnto him, as to the true, lawfull and naturall heire of the Crowne: willed them alſo to cauſe the like promiſe and acknowledgement to be made in the Campe, by all true and faithfull Captaines and Souldiers, that could not be preſent at that aſſembly, conſiſting as well of Frenchmen as ſtrangers. In all theſe ſpeaches he ſhewed himſelfe of a good cheere, which cauſed all men to hope that hee ſtoode in no danger of death.</p>
               <p>The ſaid King ſent preſently letters to all Prouinces and Cities, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſe them how things had paſſed at S. <hi>Clow,</hi> and of his will and laſt Teſtament, requiring all his faithfull Subiects to proteſt the fulfilling thereof.</p>
               <p>The ſecond day toward the euening, there appeared in the King acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, prognoſticating an aſſured danger, not ſo much through the nature of the wound, as through the poyſoned contagiouſnes of the weapon wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the wound was made; ſo that all remedies being vſed by the Phiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

and Chirurgions, to preuent the danger, and nothing preuailing, the King called againe to him the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> and other Princes and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1589.

               <p>This ſecond iudgement of God is alſo to be conſidered with feare and trembling.

This King being then King <hi>Charles</hi> the 9. his brother and Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> who iſſued out of noble raſe, not regarding his degree, debaſed himſelfe ſo farre as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the chiefeſt Captayne of an accurſed ſedition, and procurer of ſuch a murther as hated both of God and man, the fame thereof ſhall be execrable and ſtinking in the eares of men for euer. And after the murther moſt cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell indignities were ſhewed vpon the dead bodies of the ſayd Admirall and his fellowes, who after were carried to bee hanged at the place where men executed for exemplarie iuſtice are hanged in chaynes, called <hi>Mon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Euen ſo this King after that murther (thereby hauing poluted the Temple of iuſtice) neuer proſpered, and from the Lord deliuered into the hands of vile and baſe men whom he truſted, was brought to receaue the puniſhment for that murther, nigh to that place where they had executed the vttermost poynt of infamie, vppon the bodies of the ſayd Admirall and other noble men.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, whereas S. <hi>Peter</hi> in his ſecond Epiſtle and ſecond Chapter, doth forwarne the Saints both of falſe Prophets and errors which they ſhall bring foorth with them, among others maketh mention that they ſhal not onely contemne, but alſo ſhall ſpeake euill of authorities. Behold, thou (Chriſtian reader) haſt ſeene in the former bookes of this hiſtorie, all the prankes which this holy League hath played for the ſpace of theſe twelue yeares, all the horrible villanies, poyſonings and murthers by them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and hauing in their mouthes nothing els but holy League, holy Vnion, holy Church, holy Catholike faith, euen holy murthers, and all that is prophane, wicked and damnable is holy with them, ſo that it be for holy Church: God through iuſtice and mercie in this peruerſe age &amp; dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous times, when men will not diſcerne the trueth from lying by the
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:8966:212"/>
word, but by their affection, according to the doctrine of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. hath marked by theſe their abominations, as with a hot burning yron, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1589. Julie"/> their idolatries, hypocriſie and falſe religion, that men looking vppon the fruites, may iudge of the goodnes of the tree which beareth them. So in his grace and fauour he hath preſerued his Saints (profeſſors of his word) from ſuch abominable déedes, that his trueth being iuſtified may be louing and amiable vnto men, carying the ſtampe and grauen image of the ſonne of God, which is innocencie, mildnes, and perfect Chriſtian loue.</p>
               <p>Herein alſo is noted the mercifulnes of God, who will looſe none of his children. This king dyed not preſently of that wound, but God prolonged his life, both to giue him time of repentance, and to lay the foundation of the reſtabliſhing of that afflicted eſtate.</p>
               <p>For firſt, as concerning his repentance, it doth appeare that hée entered déepely into he conſideration of his ſinnes, and by that foundation of faith which remayned in him, confeſſed in the ſymbole touching the death of Chriſt, the forgiuenes of ſinnes through him, made him as if it were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the moſt part of the idolatrous fantaſies and tromperies, in the which he had béen brought vp and delighted all the daies of his life, and neceſſitie and feeling of his ſinnes enforced him to repoſe himſelfe on the onely ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the Sonne of God. So the Lord knoweth who are his.</p>
               <p>Herein alſo appeareth euidently the mercifulnes of God, who worketh all things to the beſt and comfort of his children. For when as the Rebels and murtherers ſuppoſed, that by the Kings death they might eaſily make an alteration of the ſtate, and tranſferre the Crowne vpon the head of the Duke <hi>de Mayne,</hi> and ſo diſappoynt the Princes of <hi>Bourbon</hi> of their right of ſucceſſion, the Lord turned al their counſels vpſide downe. For the Lord mooued the King lying on his death bed, when he was in perfect memorie, and fartheſt (as the manner in ſuch a caſe) from all manner of affection and parciality, to pronounce his ſentence and decrée, or rather ſupplying the perſon of God, to proclayme the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> right heire and ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor of the crowne, and by the inuocation of the glorious name of GOD, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Firſt, there was a capitulation made and concluded betweene theKing and the ſaid Princes and Nobles, Lords, gentlemen and ſouldiers, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1589.

Which thing the King pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed by the faith of a Prince to kéepe inuiolably, and with as much ſpeede as might be to prouide that a Councell and méeting of the learned might be aſſembled.</p>
               <p>This order being concluded, and the obſeruation thereof promiſed by the King, all his Princes, Nobles, Lords, Gentlemen and Captaines, promiſed vpon their othes all duetifull fidelitie and obedience vnto the K. and to aſſiſt him with their liues, goods and meanes, as well in the defence of his royall authoritie agaynſt all traytors, rebels and Leaguers, which goe about to vſurpe the ſtate; as in the execution of the exemplary puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vpon them, who haue procured or committed that haynous diſloyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, felony and treaſon vpon the Kings perſon laſt deceaſed, and all others who ſhall be knowne conſenting, knowing, or acceſſarie to the ſame.</p>
               <p>This order being taken as the readieſt and moſt expedient to vnite the ſubiects with the King, being promiſed and ſworne, the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> was ſaluted, declared, proclaymed, and crowned King of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarre,</hi> by the name of King <hi>Henry</hi> the 4.

               <p>Here (Chriſtian Reader) is to be noted Gods moſt gracious fauour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>France,</hi> and prouidence toward this great King: for except the Lord had prepared this heroicall Prince to reſtabliſh this decayed ſtate, which was caſt downe headlong into ſuch a depth of miſeries by the Leaguers, as in mans iudgement it was impoſſible that it could euer haue been vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

againe, but rather reduced into a lamentable deſolation. But the Lord in his mercie beholding from heauen his holy habitation, with his lightfull <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1589.

               <p>Againe, we may with admiration, celebrate the prouidence of God, that cleane contrary vnto the expectation of all men, the Lord hath giuen him to <hi>France,</hi> for her good. For firſt, the Leaguers in the beginning of their inſurrection, made him a party. Then they vſed for the ſpace of foure yeares, all the power of <hi>France</hi> to oppreſſe him: when force would not ſerue, they procured poyſoners, to try what might bee done that way. But that taking no place, they degraded &amp; debarred him from his right of ſucceſſion, by a fundamental law of the realme, which they ſweared, ſealed and decréed, that it ſhould be vnchangeable, and ſhould remayne for euer: they made him hatefull, and abhorred of the common people throughout all <hi>France.</hi> After they had miſſed of their purpoſe intended againſt the King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they ſo vrged their attempts, that the King was enforced to yéeld himſelfe into the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> his hands for his ſafety: at length they murdered the King.

               <p>The Prince <hi>Montpencier,</hi> gouernour, and Generall for the King in <hi>Normandie,</hi> then being at <hi>Audely,</hi> a towne vpon the riuer of <hi>Seyne,</hi> aboue <hi>Pont de Carche,</hi> cauſed all his army to take that oath, exhorting them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend conſtantly the Kings will, according to their oath.</p>
               <p>About the 26. day of Iuly, there was an aſſembly holden at <hi>Caen</hi> in <hi>Normandie,</hi> of the court of Parliament (whereto the late deceaſed King had tranſported the ſaid court from the Cittie of <hi>Roen,</hi> after the rebellion thereof) of the Nobilitie and Gentlemen of the countrey, and of the bodie of the towne and Vniuerſitie, and of the Citizens and inhabitants of the ſaid towne: where the Lord <hi>Lizores,</hi> Lord Preſident of the ſaide court, did ſit as head of the ſaide méeting, in whoſe preſence, the ſaide Preſident hauing declared the haynous déede, committed vpon the perſon of the King late deceaſed, and ſhewed the equitie of the Kings teſtament and laſt will, on his owne behalfe proteſted perfect loyaltie to the King, right and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſucceſſor of the Crowne of <hi>France,</hi> &amp; after the publication of the Kings, and of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prince <hi>Montpencier</hi> his letters, all vniformally with one conſent, did ſweare their acknowledgement and fidelitie, vnto the lawfull ſucceſſor of the Crowne of <hi>France,</hi> and to maintaine al things contained in the will of <hi>Henry d'Valoys,</hi> lately deceaſed.</p>
               <p>The like declarations and promiſes were made, and othes of fidelitie and loyalty taken, publikely in many townes and cities in <hi>France,</hi> euen on the North ſide of <hi>Loyre,</hi> to the ſame effect.</p>
               <p>The rebels vnderſtanding in <hi>Paris,</hi> what the late deceaſed King had done, and how the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> was proclaymed King of <hi>France,</hi> contrarie to their expectation, &amp; that they were worſe hampered now then before, like to haue him to be their maſter, whome they had refuſed and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, thought good to trie what might be done by treachery, vpon the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the King.</p>
               <p>And becauſe that a Friers coate could not beguile this King, as it did the other, by reaſon of the little acquaintance and credit which hée giueth them, they ſuborned a murtherer, who vnder the colour of a Gentleman, ſhould ſhoote him through with a Piece: but the Lord watching for his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed, brought the murtherer to confuſion.</p>
               <p>All thinges falling out ſo confuſedly in <hi>France</hi> by the death of the laſt King, and the newes thereof fleeing abroad into forreine countries, reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed mens harts with admiration of Gods ſecret iudgements with a maze, indignation and feare.</p>
               <p>The King taking counſell what was beſt to be done in theſe extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, for to ſaue the remnant of the realme from vtter ſubuertion, did reſolue
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:8966:214"/>
vpon theſe three pointes which will follow this miſerable murther.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the King conſidering how his enemies long time aforehand had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1589. Iulie"/> rendered him by ſlaunderous libels and ſeditious ſermons, of Ieſuits and Friers, by theſe meanes to make him abhorred of the commonaltie, and thereby to make them vnwilling to acknowledge him for their King, and to render him fidelity, loyaltie and obedience, which long practiſed malice of his enemies would procure him much labour, and long continuance of warre betweene him and his ſubiects.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he knew that in the Campe, vnder the banner of his prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor, and alſo in his counſell were many deuoted &amp; ſworne to the League, whom he durſt not truſt, and knowing that they would not do him faithful ſeruice no more then they did to his predeceſſor, hee determined to licence them to depart ſo many as would, and to liue peaceablie in their houſes vnder his obedience: whereupon many diſbanded themſelues, and retired ſome home, and ſome to the enemie.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all, the K. foreſeeing that the heads of the League vpon this proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous exploit done vpon the perſon of the King lately murthered, will double their rage, and with great forces (which they could quickly ſet vp in ſuch a mighty and populous cittie) would ſet vpon him, and with multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude might greatly diſtreſſe him, determined to ſend part of his forces into <hi>Picardy,</hi> vnder the conduct of the duke of <hi>Longueuile,</hi> &amp; the Lord <hi>la Nouë,</hi> there to miniſter play to the enemy, and with the greateſt part of his army to retire into <hi>Normandy,</hi> there to gather greater forces: and if need ſhould require, to be nigh and ready vpon the coaſt, there to receaue ſupply of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from the mightie Princeſſe the Queene of <hi>England,</hi> which might bee done vpon ſhort warning, conſidering the ſmall diſtance which is from Coaſt to Coaſt.</p>
               <p>As for the Swiſſers and other Germans, who ſerued the King his predeceſſor, hee ſent their Heads and Captaines vnto their Princes and Signories, to vnderſtand their pleaſure, whether they would call their men home, or giue them leaue to ſerue him. The ſaid Germans &amp; Swiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers (according to the Kings will and promiſe made vnto him) proffered vnto him their faithfull ſeruice.</p>
               <p>Thus the preſent eſtate and ſumme of affairs being managed, he reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into <hi>Normandy,</hi> hauing not with him aboue eight thouſand men of all ſortes, and ſtayed there a while beholding what the enemy would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe.</p>
               <p>Now we wil leaue the King about the Sea coaſt in <hi>Normandy,</hi> where we haue brought him with eight thouſand men of all ſorts, and will goe to ſee what is done in other places, what preparations the Leaguers do: and after we will paſſe ouer the Alpes, to ſee how doth Frier <hi>Sixtus,</hi> and what iolly diuinity is with him and his Chaplains.</p>

About the 31. of Iuly, which to the Papiſtes is the 21. of Auguſt, the D. of <hi>Lorreine</hi> thought good to blow the fire of rebellion to make it burne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1589.

               <p>Firſt, he ſheweth his ſorrow for the Kings death to be ſo great, that hee cannot keepe himſelfe from weeping. This weeping and teares are to be ſuppoſed to proceede from ioy, he himſelfe beeing one of the procurers of the murther.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he fayneth a great feare, leaſt the Goſpell (which he calleth hereſie, entring into their City) ſhould breake the necke of Popery, and ſo rid their Citie of that deceitfull gueſt, which by all meanes poſſible hee would haue courteouſly entertained.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, he exhorteth them to admit none of the Kings fauorers within their walles, and in ſo doing promiſeth them all ayde and fauour.</p>

               <p>Laſt of all, doo ſweare to aſſiſt him with all their power and meanes to reuenge the vnworthie death of <hi>Henry de Valoys</hi> lately deceaſed. Many other Townes on the North ſide of <hi>Loyre,</hi> as in <hi>Gastinoys, Hurepoys, Auxerroys, Bourgundie, Baſſigny</hi> and <hi>Champaigne,</hi> being wauering, encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged with the example of the noble Citie of <hi>Langres,</hi> did reſolue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in reiecting the entiſing perſwaſions of Rebels, to remayne in the Kings obedience, and tooke the like oath voluntarily as the ſayd Citie of <hi>Langres</hi> had done.</p>
               <p>As the Rebels in the reſt of Townes and Cities, tooke occaſion by the proclayming of the King, to ſtirre the people to their ſocietie of vnion, that is, to rebellion, crying ſtill the Catholike, the Catholike religion, hereſie, hereſie, heretikes, heretikes: ſo in like manner the heads of the rebellion doo prepare all the forces that euer they can: for the Duke of <hi>Lorreyne</hi> ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered a great power of horſemen and footmen, which he ſent to the Duke <hi>de Mayne</hi> to <hi>Paris,</hi> conducted by his eldeſt ſonne the Marqueſſe <hi>du Pont.</hi> The Duke <hi>de Mayne</hi> alſo ſent to the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> for ſuccour, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that with the great forces which he was able to make within <hi>Paris,</hi> the ſuccour which was expected from <hi>Lorreyne,</hi> and ſome companies of horſemen of Wallons and Germanes, he would eaſily make an end of the warre.

               <p>Now let vs leape ouer the Alpes to ſee Frier <hi>Sixtus,</hi> and pray to God that the pockes may neuer depart from him, nor from that holy ſea, ſeeing that his predeceſſor <hi>Iulius</hi> the great warriour, being either the firſt or one of the firſt in all <hi>Italy,</hi> which was infected with it (if <hi>Ihuigo</hi> doth not lye) and of a ſpeciall grace and Apoſtolicall fauour, left it to all the legions of Friers and Maſſemongers, for a token of their honeſt and chaſt life.</p>
               <p>The Rebels hauing committed that ſauage murther vpon the perſon of their Soueraigne King and Prince, whom God commaunded them to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey, ſerue and reuerence, and ſuch as in Catholiciſme did ſurpaſſe the beſt Catholike in the world: and to bee ſhort, with one blowe hauing executed the ſecret counſell of <hi>Rome,</hi> for the rooting out the raſe of <hi>Valoys,</hi> and put

In this meſſage (as it appeared in Frier <hi>Sixtus</hi> oration) they had certified him, how miraculouſly the Frier went out of <hi>Paris</hi> in great daunger to be ſearched out, and afterward miraculouſly paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed through the Campe of the heretikes, and through the Kings gardes, not perceiued of any man, (but as if the diuell ſhould conuey him inuiſible in a clowde) vntill he came into the Kings preſence: ſo that no man had no power to examine him, nor to aſke him <hi>Domine quo vadis?</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, becauſe the King would not yeeld himſelfe to be ſlayne by the Leaguers, according to the ſecret counſell of <hi>Rome.</hi> Alſo by reaſon that he ſuffered the execrable murtherer to bee ſlayne, and willed the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> and the Princes with him to make exemplary iuſtice vppon the authors and acceſſaries of his death. Frier Swineheard, (otherwiſe <hi>Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus)</hi> ſweareth by his cornerd cap, that as when it is vppon his head, there lyeth vnder it the foure quarters of a falſe Frier: ſo the King ſhall haue no Maſſe of <hi>Requiem</hi> of him, but ſhall ſouſe, burne and broile in purgatory vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till he be as cold as a Frogge.</p>
               <p>So Fryer <hi>Sixtus</hi> hauing taken ſo great paines for the holy Church, as he did that day, his belly began to call him to another worke. And all the red cap Prieſtes making their abaſhio vpon their knées, began to whiſtle with his mouth, and with his two forfingers and his thumb, hunting flies ouer their heads, bleſſed them, <hi>voto mileſorum nemo vestrum frugi e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſto,</hi> get you to dinner, <hi>edite bibite, cras moriemini.</hi>

               <p>Not long after, at the ſolicitation of the rebels, who had promiſed (in caſe Fryer <hi>Clement</hi> ſhould bée ſlaine in ſuch good ſeruice to the holy Church) to make him a Saint.

               <p>With this ſmall number the King (knowing that God would conſider iuſtice of the cauſe, and was able to vanquiſh as well with fewe as with a great number) hauing earneſtly deſired Gods ayde in his priuate prayers, commaunded publike prayers: which being ended, marched againſt his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies with ſuch reſolued and princelike courage, that at the firſt encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as it were with one blowe, the enemie left vpon the place fiue hundred men, beſide a number of priſoners and wounded ſouldiers: but the reſt fled with great feare and diſorder.</p>
               <p>In the ſame méeting the enemie loſt, as is aboue ſayd, at the firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter fiue hundred men, among whom were the chiefeſt <hi>Sague,</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonell of the light horſemen: the Lord S. <hi>

               <p>The Countie <hi>Billing</hi> Marſhall of the Camp, <hi>Temblecourt,</hi> the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of <hi>Lorreyne,</hi> who had the firſt regiment, and the Lord <hi>Sauelak,</hi> with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers other Captaines were taken priſoners.</p>
               <p>Of the Kings ſide dyed but 26. among whom were the Countie <hi>Roſſie,</hi> brother to the Lord <hi>Rochefocault,</hi> and alſo the Lord <hi>Bakqueuile,</hi> whoſe ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues were commendable among all men, for whom the King was greatly grieued.</p>
               <p>There was among the enemies, one Lorde <hi>Sagonne,</hi> a proud man, greatly boaſting of his valiantnes, who with feeling, eſcaped from the ſlaughter at <hi>Seulis,</hi> the Lord Graund Prior prouoked him to fight, who ioyning together, the ſaide Lorde Graund Prior gaue him ſuch a blowe, that in retyring and lighting downe of his horſe, hee fell downe and brake his neck.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="424" facs="tcp:8966:219"/>
Thus the enemy hauing retyred with ſhame and loſſe, the King com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded all his forces to refreſh themſelues, which thing being done, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1589.

This cauſed great ioy in the army, and euery man putting vp their weapons, the Kings men ſcattered themſelues among them: without any ſuſpition of treaſon, ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king hands like good fellowes, two of the Captaines went to meete the King, and being examined ſuddainely, faultring in their ſpeach, as kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing not what they ſaid, as men troubled in minde, named themſelues ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants to the Duke <hi>d' Mayne:</hi> in the meane while, they fed the Kings Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours with fayre words, to delay the time, till their troupes of horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſhoulde drawe neere, to aſſiſt them, deſiring very much to ſee the King.</p>
               <p>The King hauing no liking of them, commaunded his forces to march downe the medowes from them, and whileſt theſe villanous diſſembling traitors paſſed toward the Suiſſers, as though in deed they would yeelde themſelues to the King, ſeeing no more the kings horſemen before them, and their horſemen approaching ſtill, then they ſeazed vpon the Countie <hi>Rochefort,</hi> and began to ſet vpon the Kings troupes with all their might, whileſt fiftéene hundered horſemen came marching a long the medowes to aſſiſt them.</p>
               <p>The enemies by theſe meanes, being three thouſand, and the Kinges forces there, beeing not aboue three hundered Horſemen, put this ſmall companie in great feare, and began to retyre toward the Swiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers.</p>
               <p>The Swiſſers neuer ſhronk for all that multitude, but ſtoode ſtill firme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſhewing ſuch a manly countenance, that the enemy ſuſpected the retyre of the Kings horſemen, to haue been a policy to draw them into the danger of the Swiſſers.</p>
               <p>At the ſame inſtant that the treaſon was diſcouered, the Lord <hi>Chaſtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> brought out of <hi>Deepe</hi> fiue hundred Caliuers. Thus all theſe troupes were deuided into two parts: the Harquebuſiers of the Kings ſide were ſo fitly placed, that the enemy durſt not venture to ſet vppon them.

               <p>The King in this extremity, and ſuddaine diſcouering of this vnlooked treaſon, hauing ordered all things, ſet vpon the enemies, and ſhewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe both King, Captaine and Souldier, and by his princely courage, did encourage all men to play their partes valiantly. The King recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued a ſhot in his boete, and his horſe being hurt, accompanied with the

               </p>
               <p>The enemie retired with ſhame and loſſe, leauing their dead on the place, and hid himſelfe at <hi>Martinglize.</hi> The King remayned on the field, and commaunded certaine pieces of Ordinance to bée diſcharged againſt <hi>Martinglize:</hi> which thing being done, he gaue thanks to God, with ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt praiers for his gracious goodnes, ſuccour and preſence, in defending them and his iuſt cauſe. This being done, hée greatly commended the good and faithfull ſeruice of the Swiſſers, in preſence of their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, and dronke to them for their valiant exploytes done that day.</p>
               <p>The 23. of September, the Lord <hi>Staphord,</hi> Ambaſſadour for the moſt Noble Quéene of <hi>England,</hi> arriued at <hi>Diepe,</hi> bringing both money and munition, but hée ſawe not the King, vntill the next day following.

               <p>The 24. of September very early in the morning the enemy raiſed vp his Camp, without any ſound of Drumme or Trompet in the ſight of the King and of his army. This their remoouing was done with ſuch great feare, and ſo cowardly, that they left their wounded in the Villages behind them, and without giuing warning to their Sentinels to retire and ſaue themſelues: they left their victuall and munition of warre in the way as they went. They tooke their iourney as though they went to the towne of <hi>Hewe,</hi> and at length they turned to Saint <hi>Vax, Quinqueuile,</hi> and <hi>Bures,</hi> and camped themſelues on the other ſide of <hi>Diepe,</hi> entrenching themſelues in the néereſt Villages, <hi>Ianuile, Boutiles</hi> and <hi>Apeuile.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King who was on the other ſide of the hill in battel aray, ſéeing their departing to be like a fearefull flight, while hee receaued the Lord Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador of <hi>England,</hi> ſent certaine companies to puriue them, who alſo tooke many priſoners ofthem.</p>
               <p>Theſe Priſoners beeing demaunded the cauſe of the ſudden retire, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered diuerſly: for ſome ſaid, it was by reaſon of the comming of the Engliſh ſhips, which lately arriued, wherein they doubted great aid to bee ſent to the King.

               <p>The King ſeeing the enemy encamped in another ſide, cauſed his bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile to bee pitched in the plaine of <hi>Arques,</hi> and afterward in the euening brought his army into <hi>Diepe,</hi> and the Suburbs of the ſame, and all night
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:8966:220"/>
cauſed great and large Trenches to bee made in a place called the hill of Cats: and by the Morning the Trenches beeing ſtrong, he placed part of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1589.

               <p>The King ſent the Regiment of the Lord <hi>Garde,</hi> into the Caſtle of <hi>Arques.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt day of October, the enemy planted ſixe pieces of Ordinance vpon the top of the hill by <hi>Ianuile,</hi> and ſhot fiue or ſixe voleies of ſhot into <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="October"/> the Towne, wherewith was ſlaine one of the Kings Cookes, a Woman, a Maiden and a Boy, and great hurt done to two Shippes which lay at Anker in the Hauen.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Staphord</hi> Ambaſſador of <hi>England,</hi> had preſented a Canonier to the King, who beeing very ſkilfull, with a ſhot killed the maſter Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and diſmounted two pieces of the enemies Ordinance, which cauſed them to remooue their Canon: during this time the Kings troups dayly did ſet vppon them, and drew them from their Trenches with blowes and deadly woundes, who beeing weary of that continuall play, the fourth day of October they brake their Rampiers and Gabions, &amp; vpon intelligences of the comming of the Prince of <hi>Soiſſon,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Longueuile,</hi> &amp; Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall <hi>Aumont</hi> retyred with ſhame and loſſe of men, and in the Kings ſight raiſed their camp, and diſlodged on a ſudden, taking their iourney toward <hi>Picardie,</hi> and in the way ſhewed all crueltyes that could bee.</p>
               <p>The King ſeeing the ſudden and vnexpected departure of the Enemy, ſuppoſed that he went to fight againſt the power which was broughtto him by the ſaid Prince of <hi>Soiſſons,</hi> Duke of <hi>Longueuile,</hi> and Marſhall <hi>Aumont,</hi> afore they ſhould ioyne with him: which thing he miſtruſted the more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the enemies ſhifted into three ſeuerall places, and neuer frarre from him. But the King knowing that theſe helpes were come within ſeuen or eight leagues, tooke betweene three or foure hundred horſemen to goe to meet with them about the ſixt day of October, leauing the Marſhall <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi> in <hi>Diepe,</hi> with all the reſt of the armie. The ſame day he tooke the towne and Caſtle <hi>Samache</hi> in the ſight of the enemy.</p>
               <p>The 8. day, hée tooke the towne of <hi>Hew,</hi> giuing great occaſions to the Duke <hi>d'Mayne</hi> to fight.</p>
               <p>Whileſt theſe things were paſſing at <hi>Diepe,</hi> and ſometime before there was a méeting of the deputies of the Dukes <hi>d'Mayne</hi> and <hi>Parma,</hi> in the town of <hi>Aras,</hi> where the Duke <hi>d'Mayne</hi> bound himſelfe to the Spany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, to deliuer all the townes of <hi>Picardie</hi> into their han<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

out of their places, before hée had performed what hée was bound to doo. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1589. October"/>
               </p>
               <p>The Duke <hi>d'Mayne</hi> therefore, to colour his cowardlines, ſhamefull flight and diſgrace receaued at <hi>Diepe,</hi> and for that hée durſt neuer hazard the battell: he bruted abroad, that he went into <hi>Picardie,</hi> to take poſſeſſion of the townes of that Prouince, to pledge them to the Spanyards: and ſo hauing paſſed the riuer of <hi>Some,</hi> he tooke away with him, all hope from the King to come to any battaile.</p>
               <p>The King knowing well the nature of the French men, who though ſometyme in their heat and naturall haſtines they doo fall to ſedition, yet are vnpacient of a ſtrange gouernment, aſſured himſelfe that they would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer admit the gouernment of that nation, whom they of all moſt hated, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would they yeeld vnto the Flemmings whom they hated alſo, for the naturall iniuries which they do proffer one to another in time of warre, as it falleth out commonly among Borderers. Therefore he ſtayed yet a while in <hi>Diepe,</hi> as well for the affaires of <hi>Normandie,</hi> where hee left the Prince <hi>Montpencier</hi> for Gouernour, as for to receaue foure thouſand En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſhmen ſent vnto him by the renowmed Queene of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the 21. of October hee departed from <hi>Deepe,</hi> and with ſmall iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyes coaſted the enemie betwéene the two Riuers of <hi>Seyne</hi> and <hi>Some,</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till hee came to <hi>Meulan,</hi> a Towne ſituated a little aboue <hi>Pontoys</hi> diſtant from <hi>Paris</hi> ten leagues, and there vpon that bridge paſſing on the South ſide of <hi>Seyne,</hi> with all ſpeede went to <hi>Paris</hi> for two cauſes. Firſt, for to drawe him to fight: for although hee would not venture a battell for the winning of <hi>Deepe,</hi> (notwithſtanding he had ſo promiſed to his partakers) yet the King was in good hope that he would fight for <hi>Paris.</hi> The other cauſe was to withdrawe him from <hi>Picardy,</hi> where he had taken the towne of <hi>Fere,</hi> and ſome other ſmall Townes, the moſt part of the Nobilitie and Gentlemen of the countrey being with the King.</p>
               <p>About the 28. of October, the King lodged his armie a mile from <hi>Paris</hi> in the villages about. The morrowe after, the king in his owne perſon went all about to view the Trenches along the Suburbes.</p>
               <p>The laſt day of October, the king hauing prepared all things by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe of the Princes, Marſhals and expert Captaines, determined to aſſault the ſayd Suburbs the next morning by breake of the day in three ſundrie places, and to that purpoſe deuided his forces into three ſeuerall compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</p>
               <p>In the one were the foure thouſand Engliſhmen, vnder the gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lord <hi>Willoughby</hi> their Generall, with two regiments of Frenchmen, and one regiment of Swiſſers, with the Marſhall <hi>Byron,</hi> and the Baron <hi>Byron</hi> his ſonne, the Lord <hi>Guittry,</hi> &amp; diuers other Noblemen, who had commandement to aſſault the Suburbs S. <hi>Victor</hi> &amp; S. <hi>Marcel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="428" facs="tcp:8966:221"/>
The ſecond troupe was of foure Regiments of Frenchmen, two Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments of Swiſſers, and four companies of aduenturers with the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1589. October"/> of <hi>Aumont,</hi> accompanied with the Lord great Eſquire, and the Lord <hi>Rieulx</hi> Marſhall of the field, with a great number of Nobles and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who had charge to aſſault the Suburbs of Saint <hi>Iames,</hi> and Saint <hi>Michael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third companie with ten Regiments of French men, and one Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment of Launceknights conducted by the Lordes <hi>de la Nouë</hi> and <hi>Chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,</hi> ſhould aſſault the Subutbs Saint <hi>German, Bucy</hi> and <hi>Nille.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Euery troupe had a good number of Gentlemen well armed to aſſiſt the footmen, if any great reſiſtance ſhould be made. The King alſo commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded two Canons and two Culuerins to be planted in the rereward of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery troupe.</p>
               <p>He ſeperated alſo all his horſemen in three companies, he himſelfe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded ouer the firſt, the Prince of <hi>Soiſſons</hi> ouer the ſecond, &amp; the Duke of <hi>Longueuile</hi> ouer the third, each of them appointed to ſtrengthe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies which were ſet to aſſault the Suburbs, thus deuided as is afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid.</p>
               <p>The firſt day of Nouember by breake of the day, beeing a very thicke myſt, in this order the Suburbs were aſſaulted, and ſo ſhaken by the Kings power, that in leſſe then an houre they were all taken with the loſſe of fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene hundred men of the enemie. There were alſo fourteene Enſignes taken, and thirteene pieces of Ordinance. The chaſe was followed with ſuch a furie, that the Kings men mingled among the enemies followed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen within the gates of the Citie, and if the Kinges Ordinance had come, as it was appointed, the Gates had béen beaten downe before they could any way haue fortifyed them.</p>
               <p>So the King came into the Suburbs of Saint <hi>Iames,</hi> about ſeauen or eight a Clocke in the Morning, the people crying in the Stréetes with a lowd voice, <hi>Viue le Roy,</hi> with more ſhew of ioy then of any feare at al.</p>
               <p>About a hundred and fiftie Harquebuziers of the enemies tooke for their defence y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Abbey of Saint <hi>Germayn,</hi> making a ſhew as though they would hold it perforce, which thing they might well haue done, by reaſon of the ſtrength thereof: but about midnight beeing charged to render the place, they gaue it ouer. Then was the King maſter of all the Suburbs, which do lye on the ſide of the Vniuerſitie, which are as big as the Citty of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don within the walles.</p>
               <p>The King being maſter of the Suburbs, in the ſpace of two hours (ſaue the Abbey as is aboue ſaid) tooke ſuch good order that none ſtarted from his company for any pillage, vntill the Quarters were appointed vnto the Souldiers where they ſhould haue their pray. That day was employed about entrenching before the Gates of the Citye, and watch and ward
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:8966:221"/>
ſet in conuenient places.</p>
               <p>About midnight following the ſaid 1. of October, the King was aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1589. Nouemb."/> that the Duke <hi>de Mayne</hi> came into the Citie of <hi>Paris</hi> with his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, whereof the King was exceeding glad for two cauſes: firſt becauſe the enemy was new retyred from <hi>Picardy.</hi> Secondly, becauſe that hee was in good hope that he would bee drawen to a battayle for the defence of that Citie, by which meanes he ſhould not be enforced to execute his iuſtice agaynſt the walles of the Citie, and his owne ſubiects, who were greatly ſeduced by the bad perſwaſions of the enemy.</p>
               <p>The ſecond day of October the King ſtayed all the day to ſee what the enemy durſt attempt, and whether hee would venture to come forth to fight, but ſeeing they ſhewed no feeling of their loſſes receaued the day before.</p>
               <p>The third day, the King determined to yéeld them the Suburbs, to ſee whether that would prouoke and encourage them to attempt any thing. Therefore leauing the Suburbs ſet himſelfe in battayle aray, ſtaying in the field from eight vntill a eleuen a clocke, and ſeeing that no man appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, he marched thence quite for two cauſes.</p>
               <p>Firſt, for very compaſſion which hee had of an infinit number of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſeduced from their dutie and obedience, ſuppoſing that time and this perill which came to theyr doores, would make them wiſer, and call their dutyes to remembrance. But if not, that it was the iuſt and heauy iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, who hardneth theyr harts as hee did the Egyptians in olde time, that he might reuenge the idolatryes, whoredoms, contempt and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of his Goſpell, and the bloud of his Saynts, which they had powred in their Stréets lyke water, and that ſuch a great City (when theyr ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity and rebellion had come to a full meaſure) might be aſſaulted at any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tyme.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he thought good to reduce into his obedience the Countreys which did lye betweene the riuers <hi>Loyre</hi> and <hi>Seyne,</hi> which their enemies had ſeduced for two cauſes, that hee might haue a ſure way for munition and victuals out of thoſe countreys which are very fruitfull.</p>
               <p>Secondly, to procure a ſafety vnto the countryes, which are vnder his obedience, but ſpecially to the Citie of <hi>Tours,</hi> which by his predeceſſor was made the ſeat of the Realme, and was in a manner all compaſſed (but ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially on the North ſide) with townes, caſtles and holds, rebelled and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with garriſons of rebels.</p>
               <p>The Duke <hi>de Mayne</hi> playing the night Crowe, fearing the day light, arriued in the night at <hi>Paris,</hi> neither proffered any iſſue nor ſkirmiſh vnto the King, nor ſhewed any token of his being there, no more then if they had béen fallen on a ſudden into a lethargie.</p>
               <p>The King being retyred from <hi>Paris,</hi> the ſayd Duke fell to a ſaffer and
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:8966:222"/>
more profitable kinde of warre: for his money being ſpent in erecting ſo many Trophées in <hi>Normandy</hi> with that mightie Army, as he did after he had receaued ſo many ſtripes and baſtonadoes, as he ſayd, that he will no <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1589 Nouemb."/> more of that play: he determined to ſearch the Coffers of his friends the Pariſiens, whom he loued well, yet their money better.</p>
               <p>And as it is ſayd commonly, that the man who deſireth to kill his dog, maketh himſelfe beléeue that hee is mad: ſo this valiant Duke, to picke a quarrell, doth eaſily make himſelfe and the Pariſiens beléeue that they had procured the King to come to <hi>Paris,</hi> and that which the King had done by valour, was done by winking of them, and was enterpriſed vpon intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences which they had with him, and that if hee had not come with ſpéede they would haue deliuered the citie to the King. No man could deny this, for there was within the citie witneſſes, who were returned from <hi>Picardy,</hi> to the number of twentie thouſand, who had the Fortreſſes of the Citie in their hands; all theſe would beare witneſſe agaynſt them. And who will not beléeue ſuch a multitude of witneſſes: But yet if it had not béen ſo, their goods were ſufficient witneſſes of the crimes aboue ſaid: ſo that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer was rich or ſo accounted, was ſufficiently conuicted to haue practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed againſt the aſſociation and holy vnion. Whoſoeuer had goods was quickly conuicted to be an heretick and betrayer of the Catholike religion. Therefore hot ſkirmiſhes were within the Citie, deadly warre is proclay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med againſt the Coffers, Cloſets and Counting houſes of rich men. Rich Marchants are ſent for, pulled out of their houſes with their wiues and children, their goods taken to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy vſe of the holy League, they are made faſt to a payre of gallowes and there hanged: for the very zeale and deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which the Leaguers haue to their Catholike faith, and holy mother the Church, they did throw into the water the wiues and children of many rich citizens, leaſt they ſhould clayme any part of their goods. All parts of the Citie were full fo horrible executions, weeping, mourning and heauie lamentation.</p>
               <p>The King did neuer ſhewe the hundred part of that extremitie vnto his enemies, as the heads of the League did vnto their friends, whom they ſhould haue defended from being executed by others. So that the heads of the traytors hauing obtayned a profitable and gaynfull victorie agaynſt the Counting houſes and Coffers of their friends: and hauing that which they moſt deſired, doo reſt themſelues, take their caſe after ſo many ſkir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes fought in <hi>Normandy,</hi> but ſpecially in <hi>Paris:</hi> for now they haue mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to ſpend.</p>
               <p>The King being at the Village <hi>Liuars</hi> vnder <hi>Mount berry,</hi> remayned there a whole day to try whether the enemies (hauing reſted and refreſhed themſelues thrée dayes in <hi>Paris)</hi> would haue gathered ſtomacke and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued him. But vnderſtanding of their kinde of warre and victories which

they had agaynſt the Coffers of the citizens of <hi>Paris,</hi> hee determined to leaue thoſe wicked rebels to deſtroy one another, and to take the Towne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1589. Nouemb."/> of <hi>Eſtampes</hi> vpon this occaſion.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Clermont</hi> of <hi>Lodeſhe</hi> in <hi>Languedocke,</hi> had thruſt himſelfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſayd Towne with fiftie or threeſcore Gentlemen, through the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance which the Duke <hi>de Mayne</hi> had giuen them, and confirmed the ſame by many of his letters, which were intercepted, that he would come to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue them with his armie. The King by theſe letters knowing that the Duke <hi>de Mayne</hi> ſtood bound vpon his faith &amp; honour to reſcue <hi>Estampes,</hi> with all his armie the fift of Nouember hauing ſent part of his forces to compaſſe the ſayd towne, which was done the ſame day early, he followed and arriued at <hi>Eſtampes</hi> with the reſt of his armie when it was dark night, and at his comming he wonne the Suburbs, which the enemies had made ſhewe to haue defended. The ſame night alſo the Towne was taken, the Souldiers retyring into the Caſtle.</p>
               <p>The ſixt day of Nouember the Caſtle was enuironed, approaches made, and two Culuerines placed in batterie.

               <p>After that agréement, the King did ſhew that fauour to the Lord <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> and vnto fiue others, that ſhould haue remayned priſoners, to ſend them away vpon their oathes: ſo there departed out of the Caſtell, about forty Gentlemen, and two hundred Souldiours, who were ſafely conduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted halfe the way to <hi>Paris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King conſidering that poore Towne of <hi>Estampes,</hi> to haue béene taken thrée times in foure moneths, and thought it had been neceſſary for him, to haue kept a good Gariſon in it: yet notwithſtanding, being of his owne nature, as eaſie to be ouercome with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>About the eight of Nouember, the King remayning yet there, arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued a Gentleman from the Quéene Dowager to the King, bringing a requeſt, which ſhe preſented vnto the King, veſéeching him to doo her iuſtice, for the det<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>The ninth day of Nouember, the Gentleman was called before the King and his counſel, who after he had deliuered his meſſage, the requeſt was read aloud in the preſence of all the Princes, Marſhals of <hi>France,</hi> and other Lords and Gentlemen, who were then in great number about the King: by the which requeſt, beſides the deſiring of the King, ſhee did adiure, not onely the Princes and Nobility of <hi>France,</hi> but alſo all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Princes, to be aſſiſters in this cauſe.</p>
               <p>The King making anſwer, himſelfe declared, that he highly commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded her vehemency in following this ſute, and ſent the ſaid ſupplication vnto his court of Parliament, tranſported to <hi>Tours,</hi> commaunding his generall atturney, with the atturney of the ſaid Lady; to make informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt the offenders, to the end the matter might bée determined af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward in his preſence, in manner and forme conuenient.

               <p>The King ſéeing that there was no hope to bring the enemy to a bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, but by extreame neceſſitie, ſent back the Duke of <hi>Longeuile,</hi> and the Lord <hi>la Nouë,</hi> with ſuch forces as they had brought out of <hi>Picardie,</hi> to refreſh themſelues in that Prouince: he did the like alſo, by the Lorde of <hi>Gyury,</hi> who met him with a good troupe at his departure from <hi>Paris,</hi> and ſent him againe into the Country of <hi>Brie.</hi>

               <p>The King with the reſt of his army, determined to make a voyage to the riuer of <hi>Loyre,</hi> in the meane time, whileſt his ſtrange forces that were comming, would be further in their way.</p>
               <p>Therefore the tenth of Nouember hee departed from <hi>Estampes,</hi> and marched through the Countrey of <hi>Beauſſe,</hi> and being aduertiſed that the towne of <hi>Ianuile,</hi> ſtopped all the paſſages, he deſired to winne it in paſſing by the way.</p>

               <p>The King abode there after the taking of it fiue daies, during the which time the greateſt part of Gentlemen who were in the Towne of <hi>Man,</hi> and had bin ſeduced by the League, and by them induced to this rebellion, put themſelues into the Kings ſeruice.</p>

               <p>In his way from the <hi>Man</hi> to <hi>Laual,</hi> certaine of his companie departed from him, and tooke in their way <hi>Chaſteaubriault</hi> in <hi>Anjou,</hi> and brought with them the Captain to the King being at <hi>Laual,</hi> with many other pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners.</p>
               <p>The King hauing ſpent certaine dayes with the Prince <hi>D'ombes,</hi> and taken order for the affayres of that Prouince, ſent him againe to his charge of <hi>Britaine,</hi> and diſpatched the Marſhall <hi>Aumont</hi> to gather his ſtraunge forces together: ſo that the 20. of December the King departing from <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual</hi> went to <hi>Mayennelafahes,</hi> where hee was very well receaued, aſſured himſelfe of the Caſtle: and withoutleauing any other garriſons in the Towne, paſſing through a moſt foule countrey, arriued at <hi>Alencon</hi> the 23. of December.</p>
               <p>Now the Marſhall <hi>Byron</hi> departing from the Towne of <hi>Man</hi> with the armie the ninth of December, could not reach to <hi>Alencon,</hi> vntill the 15. day of the ſame moneth, by reaſon of the foule way which hindered the carriage of the Ordinance: but hauing ſent the Lord <hi>Artray</hi> certaine daies before, he had compaſſed the Towne, and at his firſt comming tooke the Suburbes, and drew them of the Towne to compoſition.</p>
               <p>Captaine <hi>Lago</hi> Gouernour of the Towne, retyred into the Caſtle with foure hundred and fiftie Souldiers, making ſhew as though he would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it. The place was very ſtrong, enuironed with water and ſtrong wals, well flanked and good towers.</p>
               <p>The Marſhall of <hi>Byron</hi> being entred the towne, kept ſo good order in it, that it was not ſeene that it had bin beſieged, the ſhops being kept open that day as if it had bin in time of peace: and preſently cauſed the artillerie to be brought before the Caſtle, and ſhot at the defences, found meanes to take away their water.</p>
               <p>The 23. of December the King being arriued at <hi>Alencon,</hi> and viewing what was done at the ſiege of the ſayd Caſtle, ſayd that the ſiege would not be long.</p>

               <p>The King hauing prouided for the aſſurance of the place, left there for Gouernour the Lord <hi>Artrey</hi> with a good gariſon in the towne and caſtle,

               <p>The 28. of December the King departed from thence to <hi>Argenton,</hi> which is a good towne in <hi>Normandie,</hi> wherein is a Caſtle of good ſtrength. There was in the ſame Caſtle three Enſignes of footmen, whom the Lord <hi>Briſſak</hi> had left there, who with Captaine <hi>Picart</hi> and his regiment were come from <hi>Paris</hi> to <hi>Man,</hi> and had promiſed to ſhewe himſelfe at all the ſieges which the King would take in hand, and he would empeach him from the taking of any towne in the countreys of <hi>Mayne</hi> and baſe <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandie.</hi> But this great warriour was as olde in courage as he was hot in words: for he neuer ſhewed his face at any ſiege.</p>
               <p>The inhabitants of the towne of <hi>Argenton</hi> hauing determined to yeeld to the King, came foorth and met him, moſt humbly deſiring his Maieſtie to receaue them to his fauour: which thing he did willingly.</p>
               <p>The Souldiers ſeeing that, retyred into the Caſtle, beſeeching the K. to ſuffer them to depart with their liues and baggage: which thing the K. granted vnto them.</p>

               <p>The 30. of December the King ſent to the towne, to be aſſured of both partes, which thing was done without force or violence.</p>
               <p>The Lord, <hi>Briſſak,</hi> and his companions rebels being beaten away out of all townes of <hi>Anjou, Mayne</hi> and <hi>Perche,</hi> had put himſelfe with the regiment of Captaine <hi>Picart,</hi> into <hi>Falaize,</hi> a Towne ſituated betweene <hi>Argenton</hi> and <hi>Caen:</hi> where is a Caſtell very ſtrong, and eſteemed to be the beſt place of baſe <hi>Normandie,</hi> the Caſtell of <hi>Caen</hi> only excepted.

               <p>The King hauing put all things in a readines for the battery determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to make one worke of two: for knowing that the Caſtell being won, the Towne could not hold out long hee concluded to place three batteries, whereof two from ſundry parts ſhould batter at one breath of the Caſtell

The third being placed vpon a rock, ſhould ſcoure certaine waies along <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1589"/> behinde the breach of the ſide of the Caſtell.</p>
               <p>Therefore the fift day of Ianuary, at eight of the clock in the morning, his Ordinance began to beate two great towers, which flanked from the one to the other, whereof the one ſerued for a defence to the breach, which he ſuppoſed to make.</p>
               <p>And after the beſtowing of foure hundered Canon ſhot, the top of one Tower being fallen, and a hole being made in the other Tower that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended the creach, the King cauſed it to be battered ſpéedily, for there née<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded but the beating of a little piece of a Wall.

               <p>The Towne being taken by aſſault, could not be preſerued from pilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and ſackaging, that there might be a difference betweene them that fled to the Kings clemency, and thoſe who obſtinatly did proue the force of his army, the one being wholy deſolat, the other reioyſing in a full quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and perfect peace.</p>

               <p>After theſe two Noble men by this newe reconſiliation had been ſome dayes together, they determined to ſeparate themſelues and their forces: the Lord <hi>des Diguieres</hi> remayned in <hi>Daulphine,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Valette</hi> went with his forces into <hi>Prouance,</hi> there to ſtop the attempts of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels.</p>
               <p>After the ſeparation of theſe two Noble men, the Lord <hi>des Diguieres</hi> firſt layed the ſiege before the fortreſſe of <hi>Auxonne,</hi> right agaynſt <hi>Montli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mart,</hi> which had been ſurpriſed by the Rebels, and tooke it by aſſault the fift day of Ianuary, the Captayne of the ſayd Fort and all his men were put to the ſword.</p>

               <p>Now we will returne againe to few matters, which were done in the end of this yeare. It is ſaid how the Duke <hi>de Maine</hi> after the Kings de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from <hi>Paris,</hi> gaue himſelfe to fight with the Coffers and counting houſes of the Pariſiens. But for recreation ſake alſo he put on the armor of <hi>Venus</hi> to fight with the Curtizans of <hi>Paris,</hi> ſo that beeing molten in all filthy pleaſures, the Lady Saint <hi>Beufue,</hi> or ſome other ſuch Uirgin did ſo dreſſe him, that his name ſhortly after was writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the Chirurgians hall, among them that had the pockes: and lying in <hi>Paris</hi> about two moneths with his army about the Citty, without dooing any thing for the aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the holy Union, onely that it might appeare that he was a King of Fryers, he was firſt annointed King of Fryers by the Chirurgians of <hi>Paris,</hi> with that holy Oile and extreame vnction, wherewith the Popes Prieſts, Monks, Fryers and Ieſuits are oftentimes annoynted, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that crowned with ſuch a crowne, as the Fryers themſelues are crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with: and about the time that he had ſomewhat recouered his ſtrength, and téeth began to be ſomewhat faſt in his head, and his drabbling had left him, Fryer <hi>Sixtus</hi> (who ſomewhat afore the Kings death had called home his Legat, who was a Uenetian Biſhop of <hi>Brixia,</hi> for that he was thought in <hi>Rome</hi> to fauour very much the kings affaires) vnderſtanding the kings affaires to haue better ſucceſſe then hee would wiſh or had expected, ſent a new Legat into <hi>France</hi> to comfort, aſſiſt and further the affaires of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels: he ſent I ſay Fryer <hi>Henrique,</hi> Cardinall <hi>Caietan</hi> his brother, <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuillo Caietan,</hi> Patriark of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> when he can haue it, Frier <hi>Philip Siga</hi> Byſhop of <hi>Placentia,</hi> Frier <hi>Francis Pauigarola</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Aſte, Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronimo Moceuigo</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Ceueda, Laurence Bauchet</hi> Iudge <hi>de Rota,</hi> and Secretarie of this Legacy, all whelps of one litter, and by one ye may know all the reſt, who were ſent in company with their traine to rid <hi>Rome</hi> of ſo many Caterpillers. Theſe routes of filthy Friers with their Mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chachos arriued in <hi>Paris</hi> about the middle of December, with loads of ſuch bleſſings and holy reliques of <hi>Rome,</hi> as the Mules of Frier <hi>Campe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius</hi>
                  <pb n="447" facs="tcp:8966:230"/>
did ouerthrow and ſcatter in Cheapſide, when hee came into <hi>England</hi> about the diuorſement of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, and Queene Catharine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1589. March"/> of <hi>Spaine</hi> his firſt wife.</p>
               <p>This Frier <hi>Henrique</hi> called the heads of the League to counſell, kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth a ſtirre with them, chid them, that they were lurking in taking their pleaſures, without dooing any thing for holy Church and holy vnion: but now they muſt go about their buſineſſe handſomly, wherefore comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the whole affaires in four principall points, whereof three of them he would performe himſelfe.</p>
               <p>And firſt after the maner of Fryers, which is alwaies in their Sermons to remember their conuent to begin with the Deuill, hee proclaimed a <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile</hi> through all <hi>France,</hi> to prooue yet whether hee might with that old pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched net of robbery, called indulgences, fiſh any money, to helpe his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter (who had ſent him to fiſh) to maintaine in their brauery the holy Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chachos and Curtizans in <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>During the time of this <hi>Iubile,</hi> which began at the feaſt of the natiuity of Chriſt, Frier <hi>Henrique</hi> do repleniſh the minds of the <hi>Pariſiens</hi> with ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions, the ſtreates of <hi>Paris</hi> with proceſſions, the Churches with ſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Idolaters, his belly with the beſt meat he could get, and his purſe with as much money as he could.</p>
               <p>This Fiſher with his ragged net was not ſo much ſuperſtitiouſly recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in <hi>Paris,</hi> as he was deſpiſed and laught to ſcorue euen by the Catholiks generally through all <hi>France,</hi> maruelling that this Saint <hi>Peter</hi> fiſher had no better tooles to goe about his buſines: and ſo as the Prouerbe is, ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome doo ſpeede the fowler, neuer the fiſher: for beſide what he did in <hi>Paris,</hi> in any where elſe he get not a poore peny to bleſſe himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he goeth about to weaken the King: for hee wrote letters to the Cardinals, Biſhops, and Nobility of the Catholick religion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he warned them of the great danger of their ſoules, in following, ayding, &amp; aſſiſting a King heretick, ſhewing them the great harme which this ſchiſme would doo in time to the Catholick Church: by which word he meant the Legioss of Locuſtes, of Prieſtes, Monkes, Friers and Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites. He wrote this, ſuppoſing that his bare letter would haue cauſed the Catholicks by heapes, to forſake the Kings defence, and to ioyne with the rebels.</p>
               <p>This letter of Frier <hi>Henryque</hi> had thrée diuers effects: for firſt ſome Biſhops thought good to repayre to the King, to ſée whether they could make him a Catholick: to whome the King anſwered, as he had once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore anſwered a Cardinall, that he was able ſooner to make a Cardinall a Hugonet, then a Cardinall would make him a Catholick.</p>
               <p>Others, as the Cardinals of <hi>Vendoſme</hi> and <hi>Leuoncourt,</hi> with diuers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Byſhops were of opinion, that it was moſt expedient to call a natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:8966:231"/>
counſel, according to the which the king had promiſed to reforme him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. But vnto this Frier <hi>Henrique</hi> the Legat would not harken by any meanes, fearing both the light and the pinch. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1589 Decemb."/>
               </p>
               <p>The nobility anſwered, that they did hold him for the true heire and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor of the Crown, whom they would eſtabliſh in the full poſſeſſion ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: and when the king had pacifyed the Realme, they will thinke on that matter.</p>
               <p>The third thing was to encourage the rebels to ſet vpon the king two manner of waies, by counſell and money.</p>
               <p>Firſt, he ſhewed vnto them, that it was ſhame for them, that while the king and hereticks had made great conqueſts, they had done nothing but lurke and take their pleaſures. That Frier <hi>Sixtus,</hi> his Maſters plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure was, to ſet vppon the king with all their forces, before hee were ſtrengthened and confirmed in the kingdome, the longer they ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay and linger, the harder it would be for them to preuaile againſt him. Now they ought to beate the yron while it is hot, and followe the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter while the rebellion is vniuerſall, the number of partakers great, the hearts of them animated, while there is great ſtore of money gotten out of the coffers of the inhabitants of <hi>Paris,</hi> out of the confiſcations and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

On the contrary, he ſhewed vnto them how the King was deſtitute of men and meanes, there were a great number againſt few, their furniture and munition was farre paſſing that of the King, they had the countrey fauorable, and enemy vnto him. They were ſtrong, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

They had Frier <hi>Sixtus</hi> bleſſings, but the king had the accurle: therefore he concluded, that they ſhould make no difficulty of the victory, it was too ſure on their ſide, and in a manner, if GOD himſelfe would fight for him (for the Friers former ſpéeches emported but little leſſe) he could not preuaile. He ſhewed alſo, that there were already in the way, forces out of <hi>Flanders</hi> comming to them, by the procurement of <hi>Bernardino Mendoza,</hi> and Frier Cardinall <hi>Damnj,</hi> the King therefore was to be ſet on, before he had any leaſure to employ forten Princes to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt him: and to ſhewe the great good affection which Frier <hi>Sixtus</hi> had to this worke of mercie, hée had ſent them fiftie thouſand Duc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets.</p>
               <p>The Duke <hi>d' Mayne,</hi> with the heads of the League, receaued this holy money, with as great deuotion as the <hi>Iubile</hi> and pardons, or rather greater. And if Frier <hi>Sixtus</hi> had ſent all Saint <hi>Peters</hi> treaſures, it had been yet more deuoutly accepted, and ſpent as merrily in <hi>Paris, inter bonas</hi>

               <p>Now wée ſée the ſtate of the Leaguers and rebels very ſtrong and rich: for they had ſet and gathered an exceſſiue impoſt, and ſomme of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney vpon <hi>Paris:</hi> they had made aboue a million of Gold, of the robbing and confiſcations and ranſoms of the Royalls in the Citie.

               <p>It is ſaid alſo, how the ſaid King <hi>Henry</hi> the third, in his way to the ſiege of <hi>Paris,</hi> had taken <hi>Pontoyſe,</hi> and ſet a ſtrong gariſon there, to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept all manner of victuals, prouiſions, or marchandize, which were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried vp by the riuer <hi>Seyne</hi> to <hi>Paris,</hi> which did greatly annoy and diſtreſſe the Citie.</p>
               <p>The Duke <hi>d'Mayne</hi> hauing taken <hi>Vicennes,</hi> muſtered all his forces, and found them all luſtie, and more gliſtering with gold, then valiant in courage, and found his forces to ariſe to thrée thouſand horſes, and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>téene thouſand footemen, with whome, whileſt his ſuccour of <hi>Flanders</hi> ſhould draw néere, about the latter end of Ianuarie hee lead his forces a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Pontoyſe,</hi> which hee beſieged, in hope to eaſe the Pariſians of that heauie burthen, and when he had battered the ſame, they within conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that they were not able to defend it, yéelded the place vpon the ſame conditions, that the Leaguers had yéelded it to the King not long before, to wit, with their armies, whereof part went to the King, to continue in the Kings ſeruice, and part ioyned with the Leaguers.</p>
               <p>The Duke <hi>d'Mayne</hi> hauing taken <hi>Pontoyſe,</hi> more full of money and hope, then courage, determined to deſcend into <hi>Normandie.</hi> And in his iourney, with his great army was ſtayed at <hi>Meulan,</hi> a Towne ſituated vpon <hi>Seyne</hi> betweene <hi>Mante</hi> and <hi>Pontoyſe,</hi> diſtant from <hi>Paris</hi> ten leagues, and from <hi>Homfleur</hi> where the king was, thirtie leagues. There he boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted and threatned that he would goe to make the king to raiſe the ſiege, or elſe fetch him out of <hi>Homfleur:</hi> but he protracted ſo the time, that the king had time both to ſeaze vpon the ſaid Towne of <hi>Homfleur,</hi> and to reſt and refreſh his army there ſome dayes.</p>
               <p>The cauſes of the Dukes delay were two: Firſt, the miſtruſt of his cauſe, which did ſtill abate his courage, which otherwiſe was neuer great: Secondly, for that he expected great forces out of <hi>Flanders,</hi> who were already comming vnto him, vnder the conduct of the County <hi>Eg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> and the Lord <hi>la Mote</hi> gouernour of <hi>Graueling.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereupon he tooke occaſion to excuſe the baſenes of his heart, who durſt neuer ſee the king face to face, except they were three to one, or very nigh: yet to eaſe his ſtomack, hee caſteth forth theſe vaine, boaſtings and threatnings aboue ſaid, but he durſt not come nigh the king, afore he had ioyned with this new ſupply, for feare of the baſtonado.</p>
               <p>The king on the other ſide, hauing taken the Towne of <hi>Homfleur,</hi> and reſted there his forces for certaine dayes, ſaid nothing, but about the middeſt of February, tooke his iourney to high <hi>Normandie,</hi> to cauſe the Duke to raiſe the ſiege from before <hi>Meulan,</hi> and hauing trauailed thrée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore miles in the déepe of winter, proffered battell to the enemy.</p>

But the Dukes heart fayling him, and hauing aduertiſement that the forces of the Low Countrey were entred into <hi>France,</hi> after that hee had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1590.

               <p>The Duke being flided away, and the King ſeeing the opportunitie of battaile gone with him, determined to do his buſineſſe and to take <hi>Dreux,</hi> garded by Captaine <hi>Falande</hi> with a ſtrong garriſon, that if he had it in his obedience, he might ouerlooke and bridle the Citie of <hi>Chartres,</hi> vntill that conueniently he might haue opportunitie to enterpriſe vpon it.</p>
               <p>The King in going to the ſiege of <hi>Dreux</hi> tooke <hi>Noueyncourt,</hi> and being at <hi>Dreux,</hi> and the breach being readie to giue the aſſault, the King vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode that the Duke was returning toward <hi>Seyne,</hi> for to paſſe ouer the bridge at the Towne of <hi>Nante,</hi> which then did hold for the Leaguers, full of confidence and truſt in that proude and mightie army which conſiſted of thrée and twentie thouſand men of all ſorts. The King conſidered wel that the Dukes forces were but borrowed, and that now out of hand hee muſt hazard, or els his companies in a ſmall time would diſband themſelues and retyre home, and that with delaying with him he might diſſipate his forces. He knewe well alſo that they who doo proffer iniurie, are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more deſperat then they who doo withſtand it. He weighed well his ſmall number in compariſon of the great multitude, and that there were forces comming to him out of <hi>Champaigne,</hi> as good as theſe which his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie had receaued out of the Low Countrey, which he might in protrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the time receaue ſhortly.

               </p>
               <p>But the King had more ſufficient and ſubſtanciall reaſons, which did bid him to encounter the enemie, as the aſſured confidence whereby he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed himſelfe in Gods goodneſſe and protection, and caſted himſelfe in his armes; the equitie of his cauſe, his lawful vocation agaynſt mutinous traytors and parricides: ſo that each of theſe reaſons was ſtronger to him then ſo many hundred thouſand men: which made him to conclude, that conſidering theſe cauſes God could and would diſſipate his enemies, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their great forces, as well with fewe as with many.

               <p>In the meane time while the King was at <hi>Dreux,</hi> the Duke <hi>de Mayne</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1590.

               <p>The King vppon the reaſons aforeſayd, reſolute to encounter with few that huge multitude, on a ſudden from before the breach rayſed vp the ſiege from <hi>Dreux,</hi> and departed the ſecond day of March: the beſieged with great <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="March"/> reioyſing, beholding and wondering at the cauſe of ſuch a ſudden depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>
               <p>The ſame day the King went backe the way that he was come, and lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in the Towne of <hi>Noueyncourt,</hi> to cut the paſſage to the enemy of a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle riuer which runneth by.

               <p>The night following that day, the King ſet in order the manner of the battaile, which in the morning early the third day of March, he ſhewed to the Prince <hi>Montpenſier,</hi> to the Marſhals <hi>Biron</hi> and <hi>Aumont,</hi> to the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron <hi>Biron</hi> Marſhall of the field, and to other Princes and Captains of the army, who with one voice hauing conſidered of it according to the ſkill of warre, they approoued, and would change nothing of it.</p>
               <p>That day hee gaue charge to the Baron of <hi>Biron,</hi> to ſet euery man in his place and order, and did chooſe that morning the Lord <hi>Vieques</hi> ſargeant Maior of the battell, who was one of the ancient maſters of the footmen in <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This thing beeing done, the King willing to begin this great worke with prayer, with great vehemency and confidence hee made his prayers vnto God in the hearing of all men: wherein hee called God to witnes, that hee knew the purpoſe of his hart, and well vnderſtood whether it were for deſire of glory, or for ambition, or for deſire of blood, or longing for reuenge, which made him reſolute to this battaile, that hee was his iudge and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes vnreproueable, that nothing mooued him thereto, but the tender loue that hee did beare to his poore people, whoſe peaceable and quiet eſtate hee eſteemed more then the ſafety of his owne life: he beſought God ſo to direct his will as hee ſhould beſt ſee to be good for the benefite of Chriſtendome. And as for himſelfe he prayed God to ſaue and helpe him, as he knew to be good and profitable to the weale and quiet of the ſtate, and not otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>This prayer eloquent in words, but more paſſing pure and deuout in ſenſe, did ſo rauiſh all thoſe that were nigh, that euery man after his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple did the like. And after that, all that after noone was ſeene in <hi>Noneyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court</hi>

               <p>The Kings companies came to a great plaine nigh the towne Saint <hi>Andrew.</hi> About the ſame plaine there are certaine villages, and a litle wood called <hi>la haye de Pres,</hi> that is the medowes border, or hedge.

               <p>The front of the battel was in a right line, bending ſomewhat at the 2. endes.</p>
               <p>The firſt Squadron on the left ſide was that of the Marſhall <hi>Aumont,</hi> conſiſting of three hundred good horſemen, hauing on his two ſides 12. regiments of French footmen.</p>

               <p>The third Squadron was of light horſemen deuided into two compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, the one, whereof the great Prior Colonell was the Leader, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther company of the light horſemen was conducted by the Lord <hi>Gyurye,</hi>

Marſhall of the field of the ſaid light horſes, hee was able to make foure hundred horſes.

               <p>The fourth ſquadron was that of the Baron of <hi>Biron,</hi> which might bee of two hundred and fifty horſes, and in the ſame ranke and order at the left hand towards the Prince <hi>Montpenſier</hi> was a company of light Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>

               <p>The ſixt Squadron was of the Marſhall <hi>Byron,</hi> who had two hundred and fiftie good horſes, with two regiments of French footmen.</p>
               <p>The ſeauenth Squadron was of the Rutters, who had ioyned with them French footmen like as other companies had.</p>

And while the King did thus ſet in order his battell, the night before and that morning there arriued vnto him ſixe hundred horſes vnlooked for, to wit, the companyes of the Prince <hi>Countie</hi> both horſemen and footmen, there came alſo the Lord <hi>Guiche</hi> great maſter of the Ordinance, and the Lord <hi>Pleſsis Morney</hi> with their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, to whom vpon deliberation was graunted place in the Kings Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron.</p>

               </p>
               <p>In the meane time the King ſent light horſemen for Spyes on the left ſide of the battell, ſuppoſing that the enemie did lye at <hi>Iury,</hi> which is a great towne, hauing a bridge ouer the riuer <hi>Eure,</hi> thinking there to ſet vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the enemie.

               <p>When theſe newes came to the Campe, there was an excéeding ioy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all men of all degrees.

All that day the two armies were in ſight one of the other. There were onely ſome odd ſkirmiſhes betweene them, in the which priſoners were taken, who reported that the number of the enemie was greater then they were aware off, and that they were giuen to vnderſtand, that the Kings com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyes were come thether rather for a faſhion, then minding to bid bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile.</p>

               <p>The King would not departe from the army, before hee had know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the enemies lodging, and had ſet all his watches in order.

               <p>The Knight <hi>d'Aumale</hi> likewiſe thruſt himſelfe into that companie, thinking himſelfe there to be ſafe, ſo that there was in that huge compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny about eighteene hundred horſemen marching in a front.

               <p>There were two other Squadrons of Launces, the one of light horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, French, Italians and Albaneſes on the right hand: the other on the left ſide of Wallons and Spanyards: in the middle betweene both were French-footemen and Lance-knights.</p>
               <p>The two wings were two great companies of Rutters, which might bee on the right wing ſeauen hundred horſe, and on the left ſide fiue hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, they had on their left wing two Culuerins and two baſtard Culue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rins.</p>
               <p>The king perceauing that the enemy would not come forward, went toward them, and hauing marched about a hundred and fiftie paces, got the aduantage of the ſunne and winde, and perceaued that his enemies were in number more then they thought: for the king perceaued that they were fiue thouſand horſemen, and eightéene thouſand footemen.</p>
               <p>The rebels were gliſtering with gold, which they had gotten out of the coffers of the Citizens of <hi>Paris, Rhemes,</hi> and other townes by violence and robery, and out of the king of <hi>Spayne</hi> his coffers, and alſo out of Saint <hi>Peters</hi> treaſure.</p>

               <p>The King was in the front of his Squadron, with a great bunch of white feathers on his Helmet, and another bunch on his horſes fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head.</p>
               <p>The Princes, Earles, and knights of the holy Ghoſt, and other prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall Lords, and Gentlemen of the chiefeſt houſes in <hi>France,</hi> were in the fore ranke.</p>
               <p>The king exhorted all his company with great modeſty, with their humble prayers, to commit themſelues vnto God, and to ſhew example to others, began to conceaue a feruent praier: which done, the king walked vp and downe, willing them to doo the like, and encouraging them like valiant men, to ſtand to the defence of a iuſt cauſe.</p>
               <p>As ſoone as hée was come to his place, the Lord <hi>Mariuault</hi> brought him newes, that certaine companies of <hi>Picardie,</hi> vnder the conduct of the Lords <hi>Humiers</hi> and <hi>Mouoy,</hi> with other Lords and Gentlemen, to the number of two hundred horſe, were within two miles of him.</p>

               <p>But the Marſhall <hi>Aumont</hi> willing to begin, ſet vppon the enemy ſo hardly, that he enforced them to ſcatter, and to flée with great confuſion and feare, whome he chaſed to a little wood on the back ſide, where the ſaid Lord Marſhall ſtayed, attending the Kings comming as hee had in charge.</p>

               <p>And as the king was returning from the chaſe to his company, with fifteene or ſixtéene horſes, he was ſet on by two battailions of Swiſſers e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, and three companies of Wallons, and certaine other who did weare redd croſſes.

               <p>The Launceknights and French footmen were charged, and about two thouſand and foure hundred remained on the place, as it were in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

               <p>The King once was minded to ſet the French companies on them to diſaray them, and had ſent the Baron <hi>Biron</hi> to that effect: but calling to mind the ancient aliance betweene that nation and the crowne of <hi>France,</hi> called him back againe with his companies, and offered them grace and mercy: ſo much he did to thoſe companies of Frenchmen, who were with them, who refuſed not his gracious fauour, but comming and paſſing by him, rendered vnto his Maieſty their Colonels, Captains, Souldiers and Enſignes.</p>
               <p>The King ſtaying to pardon the Swiſſers, gaue the enemy leaſure to auoid by flight.

               <p>There the ſayd <hi>Rendan</hi> was ouerthrowen, and aboue foureſcore Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of his were ſlayne on the place, all his footmen cut to pieces, the artillery, bagge and bagage, with many priſoners taken: ſo the Towne of <hi>Iſoyre</hi> was deliuered from the danger of the enemie, retayned and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the Kings dutifull obedience.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid, how after the victory the King deuided his army into foure parts, three of them were appointed their quarters to follow the chaſe, and the Marſhall <hi>Biron</hi> to follow after the King with the reſidue of the army.</p>
               <p>The King hauing taken this order, followed after the Duke <hi>de Mayne:</hi> but finding the bridg broaken, was faine to go thrée miles about, to paſſe the riuer afoord, and in that way he found many ſtraglers, whom he tooke priſoners, which was a good turne for them, or elſe they had béen ſlaine by others: he came ſo faſt after the Duke <hi>d' Mayne</hi> that hee did miſſe him but a little: but vnderſtanding how he was receaued in <hi>Mant,</hi> the king lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged that night at <hi>Roſni</hi> (as is ſaid) very ſimple.</p>
               <p>The fift day the Duke <hi>d'Mayne</hi> very early, fearing to be beſieged there, retyred from <hi>Mante</hi> to <hi>Pontoyſe,</hi> where he ſoiourned few dayes, to take ſome ſure order for the ſafety of the Towne, and after went to Saint <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſame day the King ſent to ſommon the Towne of <hi>Mante,</hi> which deliuered the keyes of their towne to his Maieſty, receaued and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged him their king and prince, and continued there vntill the twentie day of March to refreſh his army, wearied with ſo many labours and hardnes of winter, to take counſel of the courſe which he was to take here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, and to expect certaine munition of warre, which was comming to him from <hi>Diepe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Citie of <hi>Paris</hi> firſt author of this warre, had conceaued an aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red confidence of all proſperous ſucceſſe, by the vaine bragges which the Duke <hi>d'Mayne</hi> did caſt foorth, afore hee went out with the army. The Friers &amp; Ieſuites increaſed this vain confidence in their pulpets, by aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them, either of a certaine victory, or elſe of recoyling of the King as farre as beyond <hi>Loyre:</hi> ſo that euery day they looked for the King dead or aliue, and all his ſpoyles to be brought for a ſpectacle, and to bee ſolde and bought among them, or elſe to heare of his flight as farre as the riuer of <hi>Loyre.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="464" facs="tcp:8966:239"/>
This great confidence made them to liue very ſecure and careleſſe in prouiding for the Citie: beſides that they reſted much vpon the great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude which is within the ſayd Citie, there beeing great bablers and boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1590 March"/> (for the Pariſien is as <hi>Epimenides</hi> ſpeaketh of the Cretayns, a lyer, euill beaſt, and ſlothfull belly)</p>
               <p>The towns alſo which then did hold round about their Citie, as <hi>Pontoyſe,</hi> beneath vpon the ſame riuer, <hi>Charonton, Meaux, Laguye, Corbeil, Melun, Montereau,</hi> aboue vpon the riuer, perſwaded them that the King whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer might happen neither durſt come neere them, neither was able to let the carriage of the victuals to their citie, which was the cauſe that they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from hand to mouth, and had prouided no more then in tyme of the greateſt peace that can be. But after the rumor of the ouerthrow of the Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guers came to <hi>Paris,</hi> all the Cittie was repleniſhed with terror: many of the Citizens came to the King to plead their innocency, but ſpecially two of the chiefeſt of the citie, to wit, <hi>Belieure,</hi> who was one of the Kings late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deceaſed Secretaries of eſtate, and <hi>Brulart</hi> Preſident of the Court of Parliament in <hi>Paris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe two men had béen wauering a great while, not faythfull to their old maiſter King <hi>Henry</hi> the third, who had preferred them, neither did greatly truſt the Leaguers, and yet liued in ſome ſuſpition of this King now raygning.

The King ſaid vnto <hi>Belieure,</hi> that he had thought him to be an honeſt man, vntill he fell to the <hi>Q Mother,</hi> and ioyned to the company of <hi>Vileroy:</hi> but <hi>Brulard</hi> was receaued with greater fauour, whom the King hath employed ſince in great affayrs, as to bee his Ambaſſador to the Cantons of Swiſſerland.</p>
               <p>In this conſternation, the Pariſiens who had liued in great ſecurity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to open their eies, and ſee the danger whereto the great bragges of the Duke <hi>de Mayne,</hi> the promiſes of the Fryers and Ieſuits, &amp; their vaine hope had caſt them, and did threaten them at their doores, and cauſed them to bee deuided into diuers opinions: for ſome who were of a hot nature, would haue a new muſter to be made in the Cittie, and on a ſudden, afore he had ſuplyed the roome of them which were dead in the battell, to ſet vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon him: but this courſe was thought raſh and dangerous for many eauſes. Other gaue a wiſer counſell, if it could haue béen followed, to wit, to try his elemency, and that vpon reaſonable conditions, ther was no doubt, but they ſhould find fauour and peace: and for the proofe thereof, alleaged his gentle diſpoſition far from all cruelty, and deſyre of reuenging which hee hath alwayes ſhewed in all his actions.</p>
               <p>Some were of a contrary opinion, and gaue counſell to take order for
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:8966:239"/>

               <p>Whileſt this variance was among them, the Duke <hi>de Mayne</hi> came to Saint <hi>Denis</hi> to view the countenance of the Pariſiens, feare and ſhame warning him not to come into <hi>Paris.</hi> None or few of the inhabitants of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> went to ſalute him, but they onely who had ſent him to the butchery in the playne of Saint <hi>Andrew,</hi> to wit, Frier <hi>Henrico Caietano,</hi> Frier <hi>Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> his <hi>Nuncio,</hi> the blinde Captaine <hi>Bernardino Mendoza</hi> the Spaniſh Moore, Ambaſſador of <hi>Spayne</hi> there, and the inceſtuous Fryer Byſhop of <hi>Lyons,</hi> with few more to comfort him, and to goe forward in his begun re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion. Therefore it was thought good to remedy the affayrs as well as they could deuiſe, that the ſayd Duke <hi>de Mayne</hi> and the <hi>Comendador Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reo</hi> who was then in <hi>Paris,</hi> ſhould goe with all ſpeede into <hi>Picardie</hi> to ſtay the remnant of the forces of <hi>Flanders,</hi> which were going home through <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cardie,</hi> after they had loſt their guide the County <hi>Egmond,</hi> and that there the Duke <hi>de Mayne</hi> ſhould gather ſuch new forces as he could: the <hi>Comen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dador Moreo</hi> ſhould goe to the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> to bring him y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> goodnewes of the victory of the County <hi>Egmond</hi> and his company: but ſpecially great care ſhould bee had, leaſt <hi>Paris</hi> and Saint <hi>Denis</hi> ſhould in any caſe yeeld to the King.</p>
               <p>In the meane time Frier <hi>Henrico</hi> and <hi>Bernardino</hi> would take order to pacify the ſtrife and diuerſity of opinions.</p>
               <p>They returning to <hi>Paris,</hi> ſcattered few Piſtolets of <hi>Spayne,</hi> and <hi>Duca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos Italianos</hi> among the Fryers and Ieſuits, to teach them Frierlike Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torike.

But fearing to bee compaſſed with a ſiege afore they had ſet order in their affayres and pollicy to daly with the King, they ſent from <hi>Paris</hi> Fryer <hi>Paniguerola,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Aſte,</hi> and in haſt, and <hi>Vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy</hi> to buſie him, and to dilay the ſiege, which they ſuppoſed the K. would haue layedd preſently, with ſpeeches of truces or peace, that they might for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify themſelues in the meane ſpace.</p>
               <p>The King would haue no ſpeeches with ſuch companions, but yet of his accuſtomed clemency, ſent <hi>Paniguerola</hi> to the Marſhall <hi>Biron</hi> to ſee what he had to ſay, and what wiſedome he had brought with him out of <hi>Italy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After many ſalutations and popiſh bleſſings, the Frier did wonder much to ſee (ſayd he) that ſo great companie of Catholikes could finde in their hearts to followe after an hereticall King.</p>
               <p>The Marſhall <hi>Byron</hi> anſwered the ſaucie impudent &amp; malapert Frier, that it would not be ſafe for him nor good for his maſter to meddle with the Kings affayres: we (ſayd the Lord <hi>Byron)</hi> hold the King for the true and naturall heire of the Crowne of <hi>France.</hi> That the King maintained their lawes and liberties inuiolable, and had none for enemies but fewe ſtraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, thruſt forward by ambition, who vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pretence of religion ſought to ouerthrowe all good lawes, to lay downe the foundation of their tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, to giue entrance to the Spaniſh King, and for religion to bring in all Atheiſme.</p>
               <p>The Frier proteſted that his maſter was free from medling in any ſuch enterpriſes. But his doings, his practiſes, his miniſtring of money to the Rebels, his conuerſation and familiaritie with <hi>Bernardine Mendoza,</hi> was ſo auerred to the fooliſh Friers face, that he was proued a lying falſe flattering Frier.</p>
               <p>Thereupon maſter Frier (his ſtomacke being not yet ſatiſfied) would haue a ſaucie Frierlike fling againſt the King, and demaunded the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall <hi>Byron,</hi> how they being profeſſors of the Catholike religion, made ſo light account of his maſters holines and purpoſes, to carrie armes againſt the Catholikes their brethren.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Byron</hi> anſwered, that they carried armes agaynſt rebels and traytors, and told him agayne, that it were very wiſely done for him &amp; his maſter to looke ſomewhat neerer to his owne eſtate. For if he ſo encroached and medled with them, they would quickly excommunicate him. And that
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:8966:240"/>
there were diuers Biſhops in <hi>France</hi> as good Catholikes as his maſter, who would bee glad to bee made Patriaches in their ſeuerall Prouinces, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1590.

Some reaſoning being vpon this poynt, Frier <hi>Paniguerola</hi> was found to be ſo great a Clark, that he could anſwer little or nothing. But at length to conclude the talke, he ſhewed the ſomme of his Ambaſſage, to wit, he deſired a good peace to be concluded, and ſome paynes to be taken to bring the King to be a Catholike. But he ſhewed not his intent which was to delay the ſiege of <hi>Paris,</hi> if the king had intended to beſiege it out of hand.</p>
               <p>The other Ambaſſadour, to wit <hi>Vileroy,</hi> was ſent by the King to the Lord <hi>Pleſsis Morney,</hi> a noble man of great wiſedome and profound learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, who handled the ſayd <hi>Vileroy</hi> very plainly and roughly, reproaching vnto him his vnfaithfull and treacherous ſeruice to his old maſter <hi>Henry</hi> the third. And when he had denyed theſe things wherewith he was char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, the Lord <hi>Beaulieu</hi> both condemned his fayre flattering wordes and promiſes which he brought now full of diſſimulation, and verified his olde trayterous practiſes agaynſt his olde maſter: it was thought that iuſtice ſhould haue been executed vppon him for his treaſons, according to the Kings edicts.</p>
               <p>The King hauing ſoiourned at <hi>Mante</hi> fewe dayes, tooke his way to <hi>Vernon,</hi> which lyeth between <hi>Mante</hi> and <hi>Pont de larche,</hi> which alſo yéelded vnto him. From <hi>Vernon</hi> the Gentlemen of <hi>Normandy,</hi> to the number of fifteene hundred horſes, retyred to their home about the eight of March. The Lord <hi>Chartres</hi> gouernour of <hi>Deepe,</hi> returned to <hi>Deepe</hi> ſicke, in whoſe abſence certaine Leaguers (inhabitants there) went about to haue ſeazed vpon the towne for the League, who being detected and preuented at his returne, were exiled out of the Towne to the number of ſixe ſcore, among whom were many of the richeſt ſort of all the towne.</p>
               <p>About the ſame time that the King ſoiourned at <hi>Vernon,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Longueuile,</hi> &amp; the Lord of <hi>Tinteuille</hi> arriued to the King with eight thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Rutters.</p>
               <p>The King hauing ſeazed on <hi>Vernon</hi> and <hi>Mante,</hi> and ſtopped the traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique of that riuer with the Citie of <hi>Paris</hi> on that ſide, and prouided for the ſafetie of the ſayd Townes, concluded in his counſell to beſiege <hi>Paris,</hi> the principalleſt Citie of the Realme, where it was conſidered that the Citie being populous and great, would eaſily be woon by famine, which would eſchewe ſlaughter both of his owne Souldiers and Citizens, whome hée would by all gentle meanes bring to their duetie of obedience: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was thought good to ſtop the paſſages of the riuers <hi>Oyſe, Marne,</hi> and <hi>Seyne</hi> aboue <hi>Paris.</hi> For in ſtopping <hi>Oyſe</hi> the Towne of <hi>Pontoyſe</hi> alſo ſhould bee diſtreſſed.

               <p>The ſayd Marſhall <hi>Byron</hi> immediatly after the taking of <hi>Creſſie,</hi> layed the ſiege before <hi>Lagnye</hi> vpon the riuer <hi>Marne</hi> right agaynſt <hi>Corbeil.</hi> The Citizens required ſpace of time to ſend vnto the King, which was yet in <hi>Normandy,</hi> to craue his gracious mercie, which they obtayned.</p>
               <p>The King about the 21. of March hauing receiued certayne munitions from <hi>Deepe,</hi> and taken order for the ſafetie of <hi>Normandy,</hi> with part of his armie coaſted betweene the riuers of <hi>Seyne</hi> and <hi>Eure,</hi> and tooke the townes of <hi>Poſſie</hi> and S. <hi>Germain,</hi> and the <hi>Pont S.

               <p>Theſe great bragges did procéede of the vaine hope which they had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready conceaued of the King of <hi>Spayne:</hi> for while theſe things aboue ſaide were a dooing by the King, about the 20. of March they ſent foure Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors into <hi>Spayne:</hi> firſt from the Duke <hi>d'Mayne,</hi> and another from the Duke of <hi>Lorreyne,</hi> the third from the Duke <hi>Merceur,</hi> and the laſt in the name of the whole body of the League. They arriued at <hi>Vadolit,</hi> in the latter end of Aprill.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="470" facs="tcp:8966:242"/>
The ſomme of their Ambaſſage was to begge, and not much neither, but thrée Milions of Gold, and thirty thouſand men, vpon that condition <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1590. March"/> that they would make him King of <hi>France,</hi> if he could get it, yet promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their furtherance. So after much capping and crouching, begging and crauing, chopping and changing, what money they obtayned, it is not certaine, but it is reported that they were promiſed one Milion, and that they had thirty thouſand Crownes, which they tooke, in hope that more would come, and an army out of the Lowe Countreyes of <hi>Flanders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Spayne</hi> was willing to hearken to theſe Ambaſſadors for thrée cauſes, ambition, feare, and deſire of reuenging.</p>
               <p>Firſt, by the proffer of this Ambaſſage, hée was put in ſome hope, that conſidering the great power of theſe three Dukes, and the great power of the League, that is of the Townes, Cities, and commons rebelled, hée might perhaps ſpéede better then he looked for. And if he ſhould not ſpéed in the whole, yet he might in part thereof.</p>
               <p>The ſecond cauſe was feare, which cauſed him with all his meanes to keepe the King from growing mighty: for conſidering his great valoure, and the iniuries which both his predeceſſors &amp; he had receaued at the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards handes, would in time call them to remembrance, and ſeeke the means to recouer his owne.</p>
               <p>The third cauſe was deſire of reuenge, ſuppoſing that in working him miſchiefe, he might bee reuenged of the loſſe, reproch and diſhonour of his Spaniards and Flemmings, who had remayned to dung the playne of S. <hi>Andrew:</hi> by reaſon of theſe particular affections, &amp; not for any loue which hee had to the Leaguers or Leagued, he wrote to the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> to paſſe in perſon with ſuch Forces as hee had and could ſpare in the lowe Countreis, to ſuccour the rebels in <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the meane while that the King ſoiorned at <hi>Mante,</hi> the Pariſiens beeing hardened by the Deuilliſh and ſeditious Sermons of the Fryers and Ieſuits, as the Egyptians were by the enchauntmentes of <hi>Iamnes</hi> &amp; <hi>Iambres:</hi> they elected for gouernor of their city the Duke of <hi>Nemours,</hi> by whoſe conduct they began to fortify their walles: men, women and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, night and day, they pulled downe many houſes in the Suburbs, they receaued into the City three thouſand Germans, whom they placed part of them in the Arſenall, and others in watch and ward in the moſt needfull places of the city. They gathered corne and wine into the Citie ſo much as the could.</p>
               <p>They fortified alſo Saint <hi>Denis, Corbeil, Melun, Montereau fault yonne</hi> and <hi>Sennes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King paſſing in the ſight of the Citie of <hi>Paris,</hi> layed the ſiege be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Corbeil,</hi> which ſhortly after yelded: the King ſtopped the riuer of <hi>Seine</hi> with a chayne of Iron, ſo that no boats being neuer ſo little could paſſe by.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="471" facs="tcp:8966:242"/>
From <hi>Corbeil</hi> the King went to lay the ſiege before <hi>Montereau,</hi> which is a great towne ſituated vppon the fall of the riuer <hi>Yonne</hi> into <hi>Seine,</hi> which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1590. March"/> yeelded without any reſiſting.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Montereau</hi> the King returned to <hi>Melune,</hi> a ſtrong towne vppon <hi>Seine:</hi> this town part of it lyeth vpon the South banke of <hi>Seine,</hi> and part is in an Iland within the ſayd riuer, there the Rebels had placed a ſtrong garriſon: but the Citizens and Souldiers perceauing that they would be forced, and that there was no hope of ſuccour, yeelded the place, and put themſelues in the Kings ſeruice.</p>
               <p>The King hauing placed a ſtrong garriſon there, wentbacke agayne to <hi>Sens,</hi> compaſſed it, doth plant ſixe pieces of Ordinance agaynſt the wall, ſent a T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Gouernor called the Lord <hi>Chambalon,</hi> determined not to receaue him, except firſt he would become a good Catholike. Whereupon the K. began to batter the towne in two ſeuerall places, gaue two aſſaults, where he was repulſed, beeing within the town one thouſand and eight hundred Souldiers, beſides the Citizens and Inhabitants, who were able to make two thouſand Souldiers more. The king therfore thought good to leaue of that enterpriſe, and to follow the courſe taken, to wit, the ſiege of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> rayſed therefore the ſiege, and marched toward <hi>Paris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The 25. of Aprill the king layed the ſiege agaynſt <hi>Charanton,</hi> a towne ſituated vpon the fall of <hi>Marne</hi> into <hi>Seine,</hi> in the ſight of the City of <hi>Paris.</hi> There was in a Tower ten ſouldiers of <hi>Paris,</hi> which did obſtinat them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in the defenſe of the ſame, whom he forced and cauſed their Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to be hanged.</p>
               <p>Hauing ſeazed vpon <hi>Charanton,</hi> the king doth preſent himſelf before the Citie, about the 28. of Aprill, tooke the Villages about, began to lay downe the forme of the ſiege, where he determined to ſend part of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces on the South ſide of the Cittie, therewith to compaſſe that ſide. And with the other part to beſiege the North ſide, and the Towne of S. <hi>Denis</hi> all at once: there he maketh all things ready, maketh his approches, ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth ſtill without proffering any force, but onely doth ſtop the entring in of victuals, hoping that ſcarcenes and neede would haue mollifyed their hartes, and the preſent danger of the very famin which did threaten them would haue mooued them to ſome moderat counſell.</p>
               <p>Now wee will leaue the king before this ſiege, harkening what the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of the Pariſiens is, and goe to ſee what is done in other places. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="May"/>
               </p>
               <p>About the beginning of May, there was in the noble and loyall Citie of <hi>Renes</hi> in <hi>Britaine</hi> a ſauey ſot, prating Frier, who in the pulpit to ſtir vp ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in the cittie, tooke it for a poynt of diuinity, and an ornament of Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erlike
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:8966:243"/>
Rhetorike to call the king heretike: but the Court of Parliament there ſo gagged him with a cord about his necke, that when hee had prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1590.

               <p>About the ſelfe ſame time, the Lord <hi>Rieux</hi> defeated the Duke of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reyn</hi> nigh <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>It is ſayd before, how the King ſent the Duke of <hi>Longueuille</hi> with part of the army to ſcoure and ſtop the riuer <hi>Oyſe,</hi> who accompanied with the L. <hi>la Nouë</hi> tooke <hi>Beaumont,</hi> which was gouerned by the Lord <hi>Pierrencourt:</hi> there the Duke of <hi>Longueuille</hi> cauſed the chiefeſt men of the Towne to bee hanged.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paris</hi> beeing beſieged by the king, as is ſayd, the people do harden their harts more and more, being perſwaded by the Fryers and Ieſuits, and by them whom that ſottiſh and Idolatrous people had in admiration, to wit, the Popes Legat, the Spaniſh Ambaſſador, the Biſhops of <hi>Paris, Lyons, Glaſco, Placentia, Aſte, Rhemes, Sanlis:</hi> there were the Ducheſſes <hi>de Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, Mayne, Montpenſier.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Prouoſt, Eſcheuins, &amp; other officers, they partly encourage, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do terrifie the people, doo yet once agayne gather a great ſomme of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney vpon the inhabitants: they doo caſt great ſtore of artillerie, and prepare all things to withſtand the ſiege.</p>
               <p>They made a ſearch of all the grayne and prouiſion of victuals which were within the Citie. They made alſo a reckoning of the people, which did amou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to two hundred thouſand perſons: the corne came to that quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie as would ſuffice the citie for a whole moneth, allowing a pound of bread to euery one a day, and beſides fourtie thouſand buſhels of Oates. They appoynted one <hi>Anthony L'amy,</hi> a rich Marchant of the Citie, to haue the charge of the market, and to appoynt Bakers in euery quarter of the Citie, to whom he deliuered the corne at foure Crownes the buſhell, and not aboue, &amp; after that rate they ſhould ſell the pound of bread at halfe a Spaniſh royall.</p>
               <p>This order being taken, they went about to aſſure themſelues of the wil of the Citizens, for feare that any ſedition ſhould ariſe by reaſon of the ſcarſenes, which vndoubtedly they ſawe would enſue. They gathered all the chiefeſt Citizens and Captaynes in the halles of their quarters, and there they were made ſweare neuer to conſent to receaue any hereticall King. They were ſworne alſo to detect and reueale any man whom they knewe to diſſent from this their vnion and oath.</p>
               <p>This laſt part of the oth taken, repleniſhed the citie with proſcriptions, confiſcations, baniſhments, cruell torments, executions, funeralls and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations:
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:8966:243"/>
for a great many were murthered, many iudicially executed, many empriſoned, many ſaued them by flight: but all loſt their goods and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1590. May"/> ſubſtance, which was no ſmall pray to the heads of the rebels.</p>
               <p>And that they might moleſt the King with ſallies, they hyred the Lord <hi>Vitry,</hi> Captayne of one hundred and fiftie horſes, with the ſomme of two thouſand Duckets, which the Ambaſſadour of <hi>Spayne</hi> did pay.</p>
               <p>Thus hauing ſet a Militarie policie in the Citie, touching the ſtrength of the Citie and the ſinewes thereof, they ſometime would ſet their heads out of the gates to ſee what weather was about: but fearing ſome ſhewer of blowes, they ranne in agayne.</p>
               <p>The King hauing diſtreſſed <hi>Paris</hi> alreadie twentie dayes, or very nigh, and looking that vpon ſome reaſonable condition they would haue ſought meanes of peace: and ſeeing them contrary to his expectation hardened, and waxed more obſtinate and malicious, with part of his forces ſet vppon the Suburbs of S. <hi>Martin,</hi> which he tooke without any great reſiſtance. From that day vntill the beginning of Iune, the time paſſed away with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any great exployts, but onely certayne light ſkirmiſhes. For the king would not ſhewe any extreame force, hauing a care of them, hoping ſtill that famine would haue mooued them to hearken to reaſon, and to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber their dueties. In the meane time the King cauſed the peeces of artille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, wherwith the Duke of <hi>Longueuille</hi> had battered <hi>Beaumont</hi> vpon <hi>Oyſe,</hi> to be brought to <hi>Paris,</hi> which being arriued, the King battered the walles with thirteene péeces of double Canon.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Nemours</hi> had in the meane time caſt great ſtore of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, whereof hee cauſed threeſcore and fiue peeces to bee ſet vppon the walles.</p>
               <p>About the 13. of Iune there came foorth out of <hi>Paris</hi> a ſtrange kinde of men of warre, which were neuer ſeene in the field before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Quintus Curtius</hi> in the life of <hi>Alexander</hi> (if I remember well) reported of ſuch a kind of ſtrange warriours. For when <hi>Alexander</hi> came into <hi>India</hi> with his victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious armie, they perceaued on the top of a mountaine an army of men, as they thought with pikes and long ſtaues: whereupon that terrible armie of Macedonians ſounded the alarum. <hi>Alexander</hi> ſent horſemen to viewe the enemie: when they came néere they perceaued an armie of Apes, which had imitated the armie of the Macedonians, whom they had ſpyed out of the trees and mountaynes. All the courage of the Macedonians was tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to laughter.</p>
               <p>So the Biſhop of <hi>Sanlis</hi> would play the like part, he made himſelfe a Captain, his Souldiers were the Cartuſien Friers, the reformed Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nardines and barefoote Friers: the Cartuſiens are of the dyet of the Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for they eate nothing but fiſh, their cowle is like vnto the bag where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Apothecaries doo ſtraine their wine hippocras: and by reaſon of

               <p>All theſe rakehels armed themſelues vnder their louſie raggs, doo march in battaile aray through the City, mumbling their portuſes, and when they had giuen a ſight of their proweſſe vnto the Citizens, they would alſo goe to ſée what weather was out of the Towne: and when they had marched a while, the Kings gardes in the Suburbs tooke the ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, ſuppoſing to haue to deale with men; but when they had the ſight of this legion, and perceauing that they were apes imitating men, they tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned their fury to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>About this time bread began to be ſcarſe in <hi>Paris.</hi> whereupon the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Citie fearing the increaſing of famine, ſought out all the poore within the Citie, who came to thirty thouſand, and determined to haue turned them forth out of the City to take their fortune.

               </p>
               <p>The King knowing well of the great extremity, wherewith the Citie was diſtreſſed, pittyed them, and willed them to take ſome pitty of their diſtreſſed eſtate, promiſed them mercy and fauour: but the Friers <hi>Henri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co Caietano</hi> and <hi>Goundi,</hi> anſwered contrary to the meaning of the poore people, that they had determined to dy all, rather then to admit an hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call King.</p>
               <p>Vpon this anſwer of the Pariſiens, in the latter end of Iune, many no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men and gentlemen began to mutter in the Kings army, what great imminent danger, was hanging ouer <hi>France;</hi> the ruine of the nobility, the decay of ſo great and noble a City as <hi>Paris</hi> was: and the deſolation of the whole realme, which euills the King could redreſſe, in making himſelfe a Catholicke. Of this faction, tending to ſome enterpriſe, was chiefeſt the prince of <hi>Soiſſon,</hi> and went ſo farre as to ſpeake openly, that they will ſerue no longer vnder an hereticall King.</p>
               <p>The King aduertized of this muttering, called his nobles and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, ſhewed them what hee was, what his right and cauſe was. And whereas they willed him to become a Catholicke, he put the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of doubt, that for to purchaſe many Kingdomes, as great as the realme of <hi>France</hi> was, hee would neuer ſo little depart from his religion, which hee knewe was grounded vpon the infallible truth of God.</p>
               <p>As for their ſeruice, he made no great account, knowing that it was God who was his ſtrength, force, and defender of his cauſe, willed them to depart from his army when they would, and that hee had rather haue their roome as their company: he knew that GOD would giue him the meanes and power in time to repreſſe his enemies: he knew that GOD would raiſe him friends enough to aſſiſt him.</p>
               <p>It is ſayd before, how the King all in one worke did beſiege S. <hi>Denis,</hi> which is a towne walled within foure miles of <hi>Paris.</hi> In this Towne in an Abbey where the burials and monuments of the kings were: this towne was ſo gretaly diſtreſſed, that they had neither bread nor munition to defend themſelues, they had conſumed all their prouiſion, Horſes, Aſſes, Dogges, Cattes, Rattes, Mice, Hearbes, Rootes, and whatſoeuer the belly could aduiſe them: Euen to haue tryed to make bread with flower of Oates,

               </p>
               <p>The ſayd towne therfore conſidering how the famin within, &amp; the ſword without did threaten them, proffered parly, and at length concluded to deliuer the towne to the King, with liues reſerued vnto all maner of men, the ſouldiers and all manner of men to retire with all thinges which they would carry away: who of his great clemency gaue them Horſes and Cartes for their carriage.</p>
               <p>The ſame day the King entred into Saint <hi>Denis</hi> with great reioycing of all men, who had proued his gracious fauour and clemency.</p>
               <p>And beeing ſetled in his lodging, he ſpyed in the chamber of preſence three men walking in the habit of gentlemen, whom hee knew not, but he ſuſpected that they were there for no good. They vppon that ſuſpition were apprehended, and examined by certayne noble men appointed by the King: vppon a ſudden they faultered in their anſweres, and changing their countenance were ſent to priſon: but afterward being narrowly exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, they confeſſed that two of them were Fryers of Saint <hi>Francis</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and the third to be a Prieſt, and they three were of the 24. who had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>About the beginning of Iuly, the Lord <hi>Viques</hi> a moſt cruell Leaguer, had beſieged <hi>Pontarſon</hi> a towne in baſe <hi>Britaine,</hi> holding for the King a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Leaguers, and after three aſſaults, in the which he was repul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, he heard that the county of <hi>Thorigni</hi> was comming with great for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to rayſe the ſiege: wherupon he retired to S. <hi>Michaels</hi> mount, &amp; wrote letters vnto the Duke <hi>Merceur,</hi> who was then at <hi>Nantes</hi> for ſuccour, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring leaſt he ſhould bee forced in the ſayd mount Saint <hi>Michaell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hee that carryed the letters came with the ſayd letters to the Earle of <hi>Thorigny,</hi> who hauing peruſed the letters, ſent the copie of the ſame to the Prince <hi>Dombes,</hi> who was betweene Saint <hi>Mal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Meſſenger came agayne to the ſayd Earle, and ſhewed him the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere

                  <hi>Nantes,</hi> and the Earle of <hi>Thorigny</hi> marched towards the ſayd <hi>Merceur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Duke perceauing that hee was compaſſed betweene two armies, ventured to fight with the Prince <hi>Dombes,</hi> and whileſt they were a figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, the Earle came vppon him on the other ſide: hee was ſo beaten be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them, that he loſt ſeuenteene Enſignes, and twelue hundred of his company were ſlayne on the place: he ſaued himſelfe by flight into the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtell <hi>Joſſelin,</hi> one of the ſtrongeſt places in all <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the Lord <hi>Viques</hi> vnderſtood of this ouerthrow, he yeelded, and in the concluſion he gaue his Daughter in marriage to the yonger brother of the Lord <hi>Montgomery,</hi> who was kept priſoner by him. He was permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to keepe Saint <hi>Michaell</hi> for his ſafety.</p>
               <p>About the ſame tyme the ſtrong Towne of <hi>Dinan</hi> in baſe <hi>Normandie</hi> hearing of the ſayd ouerthrow of <hi>Merceur,</hi> did beat out of their town their gouernour, brother of the Duke <hi>Merceur,</hi> killed many of his Souldiers, and among them the chiefeſt of his Captayns named <hi>Iahn,</hi> and ſo yeelded vnto the King.</p>
               <p>About this time alſo the inhabitants of <hi>Kilbeuf</hi> in <hi>Normandie</hi> took a gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley of the Duke <hi>Aumale</hi> laden with his goods, as it was going vp to <hi>Roan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this moneth of Iuly, the Franciſcan Fryers of <hi>Sanlis</hi> muſt needes plaie a Fryerlike part: they were greatly deſyrous to betray the towne, and to deliuer the ſame into the Leaguers handes: which for to bring to paſſe, they cauſed many Captains of the rebels to come thether, apparrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led like Countrey men, hauing each of them a baſket full of Cheries vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon their ſhoulders, as though they were market-folkes to ſell Cheries.</p>
               <p>Theſe Cherie mongers were receaued by the ſaid Friers into their Fryery houſe, where they had gathered together great prouiſion of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor. But this thing beeing ſuſpected by ſome good Citizens, they notify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to the King. Whereuppon many were taken, and of the Fryers, Maſſe-mongers, Chery-mongers and treaſon-mongers of the Towne were hanged, to the number of ſeauen ſcore, and ſo the play was ended.</p>
               <p>Wee haue left the King at Saint <hi>Denis,</hi> whileſt wee went to ſee what was done in other places of the realme: now wee will come to the ſiege of <hi>Paris,</hi> and firſt ſpeake of the ſtate of the Citie.</p>
               <p>There the famin had ſo preuailed in the beginning of Iuly, that it far paſſed the famous famin of <hi>Saguntum.</hi> Then began they to denounce war agaynſt all the leane horſes and ſkiruy iades, agaynſt the aſſes, cats and dogges: theſe things were more dayntie vnto them then the daynties of <hi>Sibaris</hi> little bread, and that of Oates with huſke and all was very ſcant, it
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:8966:246"/>
was for Princes and great Ladies, and that a ſmall quantity euery day.</p>
               <p>In this extremity Fryer <hi>Henrico Caietano</hi> had ſold and waſted all his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1590. Iuly"/> money and plate, and begging was there little regarded: he with the reſt of his Maſſe-mongers did bury in their ſtomackes their God, whom they had made with fiue words, in horſe dung, if they could get it: but a ſtrange thing there happened, as had béen heard of in any age, to wit, the Aſſes of <hi>Sorboun</hi> were enforced to deuour their owne brothers fleſh.</p>
               <p>There were foure ſorts of men who went about to remedie this extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, each one following their courſe.</p>
               <p>Some of the beſt ſort and ſtouteſt ſtomacke pittying themſelues &amp; their fellow Citizens, whom they ſaw periſh by heaps for the pleaſure of few rebels; by the aduiſe of one <hi>Renard</hi> Atturney in the Court of Parliament, tooke counſell how to deliuer the Cittie into the Kings hands, of whoſe clemency and gracious fauour toward the poore diſtreſſed people, they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured themſelues. But beeing diſcouered, ſome fled to the King, who were graciouſly of him receaued: ſome were taken priſoners, and the ſaid <hi>Renard</hi> with ſome others were executed, but the goods of all were forfay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the heads of the League.</p>
               <p>The ſecond was the Duke <hi>de Mayne,</hi> who fearing greatly the loſſe of <hi>Paris,</hi> being abroad where he made ſhift for good cheere, though it were at other mens charge, as the ſaying is: <hi>Qui ſatur eſt pleno laudat ieiunia ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre.</hi> He writeth letters to the inhabitants of <hi>Paris,</hi> commending them for their great conſtancie, promiſeth them ſuccour and great prouiſion of vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals within a certayne time prefixed in the letter, willing them to bee pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient yet, and not to goe about any making of peace with the King.</p>
               <p>The Friers and Ieſuites tooke the copies of theſe letters, read them in their pulpets, and ſerued them for text to diſcourſe vpon, and to make braue and luſtie ſermous.</p>
               <p>The third was the blind Captaine <hi>Bernardine,</hi> who taught the delicate Pariſiens the dyet of his countrey, to wit, to take Oates ground, meale huſke and all, and therewith to make a kinde of pap, ſuch as the countrey men in <hi>Spayne</hi> doo vſe for their ordinarie dyet, and as they doo in <hi>France</hi> for the fatting of their hogges, and here in <hi>England</hi> the Hunters doo for their houndes: and that ſlubber ſauce to bee ſould to them that had money by a meaſure, which was followed as long as Oates did laſt.</p>
               <p>The fourth was the Prieſts, who would alſo feede their mindes with idolatrous fantaſies, as their bodies were fed ſparingly with ſpaniſh ſlub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber waſh: and firſt to begin, they perſwaded them to vow to <hi>Nostra donna di Loretta,</hi> a lampe and a ſhip of pure ſiluer of the waight of three hundred markes, which ſhould be ſent by ſome of the chiefeſt of the Citie.</p>
               <p>The ſecond id<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>latrous fantaſie wherewith they deluded that beſotted people, was, that they made them runne to and fro in proceſſion bare footed
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:8966:246"/>
and bare legged from Church to Church, from Idoll to Idoll, carrying <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1590. Iuly"/> their God in the ſtreetes, which their Prieſt had made with fiue words. All the ſtreetes did ſound with weake <hi>Ora pro nobis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third was a Pageant which they played in this wiſe: they had made vppon the great Altar of their Churches a graue like a monument, there they buried their God, (who be like was dead with famine) and let him lye for the ſpace of 8. daies, and in the ſame ſpace the Churches were full night and day with Candles, ſmoake, idolatries and ſtarued people. Who had required theſe things at your hands? It is ſubmitting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vnto Gods ordinance, that would quickly remedie this diſtreſſe, and not theſe idolatries.</p>
               <p>The Oates being ſpent, the famine preuailed more and more, the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt time alſo was come. The King did winke at many ſallies which they did, to ſteale away ſome ſheaues of corne, hoping by that meanes to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſome of the heads of the rebellion: ſo there were daily ſkirmiſhes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the harueſt, and they alſo carried away with them ſomewhat, which (although dearely bought) did relieue ſomewhat the extremitie of their hunger.</p>
               <p>Whileſt theſe ſallies were adoing, about the fifteene day of Iuly the Lord <hi>Chaſtilion</hi> arriued vnto the King with one thouſand horſemen and two thouſand footmen Gaſcoynes.</p>
               <p>The King perceauing the wilfull obſtinacie of that people, or rather the hard bondage that they were in vnder fewe rebels, ſet all his forces in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and ſet vpon all the Suburbs of <hi>Paris</hi> all at once, which ſeazed vppon without any loſſe the 18. of Iuly, ſuppoſing that his neighborhead would cauſe them enter in conſideration of their miſeries and daungers.</p>
               <p>This narrow ſiege, debarring them wholy from the fields, made the famine yet to preuaile more: ſo that now in few dayes, the people dyed by heapes in the houſes within, and in the ſtreates without. Now the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people wiſheth for peace, and imputeth all their miſeries vnto blind <hi>Bernardine,</hi> many did threaten openly in the ſtreates, that it were a good déede to hang that Spaniſh Moore, and all his company of Sarrazins broode.</p>
               <p>Blinde <hi>Bernardine</hi> hearing of theſe newes, wiſhed himſelfe to haue béen in <hi>Spayne</hi> a dauncing naked with the Sarrazen Moores of <hi>Spayne:</hi> yet to pacifie the people, hee did beſtow of his Spaniſh potage made of Oates, vpon them ſo much as he could ſpare, for hée was fallen to his olde dyet of <hi>Spayne,</hi> and withall hee gaue them old ſtarued horſes which were like to dye, for to kill and to e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The morrow after being the 19. day of Iuly, a great multitude aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1590 Iulie"/> themſelues in the palace, and requir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The 27. of Iuly, they aſſembled themſelues againe into the palace with ſtrong hand, and required of the Pſeudeſenat, either bread or peace: and whereas a Marchant of the City named <hi>Goys,</hi> did reproue them, by them he was hurt, ſo that within few dayes he yeelded his rebellious ſoule: the matter tending to ſedition, the Duke of <hi>Aumale</hi> came to the palace, ſhut vp the doores, and tooke ſome priſoners, whereof two of them were hanged.</p>
               <p>Then the mutiny of the people encreaſing, they went to the Biſhops houſe, willing him to goe about the matter, that they might haue either bread or peace: whereupon ſome of the counſelers of the Pſeudoſenat, pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tying their owne, and the miſery of the people, with the Biſhop of <hi>Lions,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Nemours,</hi> and others of the chiefeſt of the rebellion entred in counſell, whether they ought to admit the King vpon reaſonable conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſpecially hauing their autonomy. The matter being diſcourſed, and ſome altogether inclining to peace, withſtanding that counſell, the Duke of <hi>Nemours,</hi> gouernour of the city, ſaid in great anger, that he had rather ſee the City conſumed then loſt: meaning that if it were yéelded vnto the King, he eſtéemed it loſt, and going foorth in great anger, would not be preſent any longer in ſuch deliberation: notwithſtanding, they agréed all to ſend Ambaſſadors to the King, to entreate of an vniuerſall peace. The meſſengers were the Biſhops of <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Lions,</hi> and certaine others de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted for the City, who went to the King, lodged them in Saint <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi> Abbey nigh the City, whome he receaued more courteouſly then they thought he would haue done.</p>
               <p>They propounded to the King two things, an vniuerſall peace, and that he ſhould become a Catholick, and ſo the City of <hi>Paris</hi> would ſet o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen their gates, acknowledge and Crowne him King of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King anſwered that he would receaue them to mercy, without binding himſelfe to any thing: it appertained vnto Kings to pardon his ſubiects, but not to ſubiects to preſcribe peace, and to deuide peares with their King, as for his religion hee commaunded them not to mooue any talke thereof, for hee was reſolued in his faith, which he did not meane to change, and willed them with this reſolution to returne to <hi>Paris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Duke <hi>d'Mayne</hi> vnderſtanding that the Kings forces were lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:8966:247"/>
at the gates of <hi>Paris,</hi> and that the City within was full of vprores of the people, periſhing for hunger: perceauing alſo the long delayes of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1590.

               <p>The King gaue them licenſe to come in his preſence, and alſo to repaire to the Duke <hi>d'Mayne</hi> with this anſwer, that hée had not any delight in their miſery and vndooing. The intent of this Ambaſſage, was but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay the time, leaſt the K. ſhould force the City while he poſted to <hi>Bruxels,</hi> there to ſolicit the Duke of <hi>Parma.</hi> For he wrote a letter vnto the Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiens by a ſecretary of the Biſhop, by the which he willed them to hold out, and to make no peace, for there was a reſcue comming, great forces, and great ſtore of victuals.</p>
               <p>Now we will leaue the King in the Suburbs, and walke to <hi>Bruxels</hi> in <hi>Brabant,</hi> to ſee how the Leaguers affaires doo ſpeede there.</p>
               <p>It is ſaide before how the Leaguers ſent foure Ambaſſadors into <hi>Spayne</hi> at one clap, and there the cauſes were ſhewed, which moued the King of <hi>Spayne</hi> to hearken vnto their petition, &amp; how he ſent to the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> to goe into <hi>France,</hi> with ſuch power as he could conueniently make, to relieue and reſcue <hi>Paris.</hi> Now wée will ſhew the intent which the King of <hi>Spayne</hi> kept, vncommunicable to himſelfe.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Spayne</hi> hauing placed the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> as regent in the Low Countries, and perceauing that he being ſetled in the Country, and hauing purchaſed friends and partakers there, began to ſuſpect him, as that hée ſhould not bée able to haue him out, without ſome wrangling and wreſtling, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>This ſuſpition made the King oftentimes to play the Phiſition with the Duke, and to miniſter him ſpaniſh phiſick, afore he was ſick, as boles, pills and potions. But the ſaid Duke being ſkilfull in Italian Phiſick, prouided ſuch counter phiſick, that by boles, pills and potions, he preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the druggs of <hi>Spayne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Spaniſh King therefore ſéeing that his Phiſick would not work, tooke occaſion by this Ambaſſage, to rid his hands of him, either by ſome blow y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he might receaue, or elſe by preuention: therefore he commaunded him to take ſuch regiments of Wallons &amp; Italians, as he knew well to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour the ſaid Duke, &amp; ſuch Lords as had any amity with him, to go with all ſpéed to ayde the Leaguers: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by theſe meanes the Spaniards remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in the countrey while another gouernour ſhould be ſent, might ſeaze vpon the holds and forts of the land, &amp; ſo to ſhut him out, and exclude him

               <p>The ſecond argument is, that Fryer <hi>Sixtus</hi> had beene greatly deſired by the holy vnion, and alſo had promiſed to pronounce excommunication a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the King and the Royals, which he would neuer doo.

               <p>The King conſidering his office and charge annexed and inſeparably ioyned to his Crowne, to miniſter iuſtice, that is, to puniſh the offenders and tranſgreſſors, and that there began the rebellion, there was by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of moſt wrought the death of the King, and that by the reioycing and approbation of the ſayd death, they had rendred themſelues acceſſarie and guiltie of the ſame, euen their walles, houſes, temples, all whatſoeuer they had.

               <p>Now the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> beeing on Cockhorſe, beginneth to triumph and diſdayne all: he altered the Duke <hi>de Mayne</hi> his reſolution, and the courſe of this voiage: yet neceſſitie which hath no law, made the Duke <hi>de Mayne</hi> to take all theſe Italian inſolencies &amp; pranks in good part: &amp; néede (which maketh the old woman trot) enforced him to put in vre all the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences and ceremonies which he learned at <hi>Bruxels</hi> among the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars, wherein he had profited very wel for his time.</p>

               <p>The King hauing intelligences of the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> his marching out of <hi>Meaux</hi> the 30. of Auguſt, raiſed his armie from before <hi>Paris,</hi> leauing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> citie and the Suburbs at liberty.

               <p>The Pariſtens ſeeing, that when they had come to an extreame period of danger (which in truth had béen an eaſie and an ineſtimable benefite to haue fallen into the Kings hands) were filled with great ioy. The Duke

               <p>The Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> at his firſt marching from <hi>Meaux,</hi> hauing paſſed the brooke, which runneth by the Towne of <hi>Clay,</hi> lodged at the Caſtell <hi>Freſme.</hi>

               <p>The ſaid Lords there arriued, found the enemies Harbingers, who had begun to take lodgings, whom they put to flight.</p>

               <p>The Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> vnderſtanding that his Harbingers had béene bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten out of <hi>Chelles,</hi> and that the King lodged there, did double his feare, and diſappointed of his lodging, would néeds goe (accompanied with the D. <hi>de Mayne)</hi> to view the plaine where the King ſtood in battel aray: but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauing the King comming with a good troup directly toward them, was contented for that time to take no neerer ſight.</p>
               <p>The fifth day the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> placed his army incloſed betweene two brookes, and on the one ſide vpon one of the brookes, there is a wood and a Caſtell called <hi>Brow,</hi> and a little aboue the Caſtell a hill.

               <p>About 11. a clocke that day the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> with the Duke <hi>de Maine</hi> went vp on the top of the hill to view the army, and the ſituation of the plaine, which when hee had deſcried hee gaue a deepe ſigh, and fell into a

It is ſaid before, how the King hauing miſſed to take <hi>Paris</hi> by Eſcalade, gaue it ouer, perceauing that God had a further and a heauier iudgement to execute vpon that City, then he was determined to ſhew, if it had come into his hands: and therefore reſting himſelfe vppon Gods good will, which will turne all things to the good and comfort of them that bee his, returned to his army, which had remoued from <hi>Chelles</hi> to <hi>Boundy.</hi> The enemies (notwithſtanding the King Campe had remoued) remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſtill in their myre, fearing ſtill to be drawne where they were not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued to goe.</p>
               <p>The Nobility, who vpon the newes and rumour of the battayle, had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorted vnto the King without any prouiſion of neceſſary things, and by the obſtinacie of the enemies, perceauing that they were not determined to come to handy blowes, brged their departure.</p>
               <p>The King in like manner being out of hope to come to hand with the enemie, otherwiſe then leaſure might afoord, from <hi>Boundy</hi> tooke vp his lodging to goe to <hi>Goneſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The 12. day of September at <hi>Goneſſe</hi> the King aſſembled the Princes, officers of the Crowne, and the expert and valiant Captaynes of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, which altogether made a noble and famous counſell.

               <p>And whereas the enemie would not warre after his maner, he thought conuenient to apply himſelfe vnto his.

               <p>He ſhewed alſo, that in furniſhing the Townes round about <hi>Paris</hi> with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1590. Septemb."/> ſtrong garriſons and victuals, the Citie would remayne ſtill diſtreſſed, as well as with an armie.</p>
               <p>Alſo that a meane power was ſufficient to coaſt the enemie, and to bée at his heeles whatſoeuer he would attempt, and that the reſt of the forces might returne to the Prouinces whence they came, which would be a great reliefe for them, and by relieuing themſelues, might haue opportunitie ſtill to get ſomewhat.</p>

In theſe extremities they being not able to rid their hands of them, if by any meanes they might be ſhifted off, requeſted the ſayd Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> that hee would open the riuer for the traffique, without the which thing that mightie Citie could not be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided of neceſſaries, wiſhing that their neighbours might bee combred with them rather then they themſelues.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> to pleaſe the people, made them beleeue that out of hand he would goe to take the Townes ſituated on the vpper part of the riuer, then hee would goe to reſcue <hi>Clermont,</hi> then will hee take all the Townes betweene <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Roan.</hi>

               <p>The inhabitants being few, and wearie, maimed and out of breath, ouercome by the multitude of ſound, luſtie and freſh, were enforced to gene ouer the defence of the wall, and ſought to ſaue themſelues.</p>

               <p>This feaſting ended, he returned to <hi>Corbeil,</hi> there he began to enquire for all the ingeniours that could be heard of, he will builde forts and bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warks, he would fortifie that Towne ſo, that if the Gyants of old time ſhould put <hi>Oſſon</hi> vpon <hi>Pelias,</hi> &amp; <hi>Pelias</hi> and <hi>Oſſon</hi> vpon <hi>Olympus,</hi> yet would they labour in vaine, ſo ſtrong and impregnable the Village of <hi>Corbeil</hi> ſhould be: to be ſhort, he would make it the chiefeſt key of <hi>France,</hi> not to

               </p>
               <p>The great matters put in deliberation in that counſell, were the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of an errour, which he had committed afore he departed from <hi>Brux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els:</hi> for there he tooke counſell how to enter into <hi>France,</hi> but not how hée might goe forth.

               <p>This great <hi>Cham</hi> of <hi>Tartaria</hi> had behaued himſelfe, both in <hi>Paris</hi> and elſe where, as at <hi>Lagny, Corbeil,</hi> and other places, ſo inſolently <hi>a lo modo Jtaliano,</hi> or <hi>Hispaniolo,</hi> that the Leaguers themſelues accurſed the time, that euer they ſent for ſuch a gueſt, féeling by experience, that hée had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into <hi>France,</hi> not in <hi>preſidium,</hi> but in <hi>exitium,</hi> as a ſcourge of Gods wrath.

And in the latter end of October, taking his leaue from the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſiens, and commending them to the mercifull kéeping of our bleſſed La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, who dwelleth there in the great tempell, and to the good old great S. <hi>Chriſtopher,</hi> dore kéeper of the ſaid tempell, marched homeward through <hi>Brie.</hi>

               <p>But before his departing, fearing that hée would bée purſued by the King, he went about to beguile him with diſſimulations, for he procured the Duke <hi>d'Mayne</hi> to ſend <hi>Vileroy</hi> to the King, to moue a parley about the renuing of ſome treaty of truces, that in the ſhadow of the ſame, hée might ſlide home without any Sunne burning, vſing the pollicy of the fiſh, called <hi>Sepia,</hi> which powreth out his ynke in the water, that in the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes thereof, he may auoide from the ſight of the fiſher.</p>
               <p>About the fourth day of Nouember, the King vnderſtanding of the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> his retyre out of <hi>Paris,</hi> ſuppoſing that it was to returne home, departed from <hi>Eſcouis</hi> in <hi>Normandie,</hi> with few light horſemen with him, and certaine Harquebuſiers on horſeback, leauing the reſt of the army vnder the conduct of the Marſhall <hi>Byron,</hi> to employ it where he ſhould thinke moſt expedient.

forſake the Duke <hi>d'Mayne,</hi> and to make him their Soueraigne gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, whereunto by ſecret practiſes he ſolicited a great number. But ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1590.

Therefore hée inſtantly vrged the Duke <hi>d'Mayne,</hi> that he would rely his forces to kéepe him ſafe, caring little what might become, either of the Duke <hi>d'Mayne</hi> or of the Leaguers, ſo that hée might get out of this lurch that hée ſawe himſelfe in. This feare was the chiefeſt cauſe of his long ſoiourne in <hi>Brie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But whileſt hée was carefull of his ſafe returne into <hi>Brabant,</hi> the King had appoynted the Lord <hi>Gyury</hi> (a man of great valour &amp; policie) to make choiſe of ſome ſufficient number of his beſt and moſt approoued ſouldiours, and to march toward <hi>Corbeil,</hi> there to ſeeke opportunitie to reuenge the cruel iniurie done to his ſubiects, by the Spanyards and Wallons, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of part to the number of one thouſand were left there in garriſon.</p>
               <p>The occaſion of recouering <hi>Corbeil</hi> was thus. The maner of Wallons and Spanyards and popiſh nations beyond the Seas, is to drinke and quaffe very largely the tenth day of Nouember, in the worſhip of that good Biſhop S. <hi>Martin,</hi> who gaue halfe of his cloake to the diuell, when hee was through pouertie enforced to begge. But it is moſt like that they doo keepe that ryot more in the worſhip of the diuell who begged, then of that good man, who in his life time knewe very well, that it is not the cuſtome of the Church of God to worſhip the Saints, neither with drunkenneſſe, nor by any other meanes els.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Gyury</hi> knowing that dronken faſhion of them very well, tooke that opportunitie to do his feate.

The Spanyards and Wallons halfe dronke and halfe a ſleepe, ranne as deſperat perſons to the walles, and made a very forcible reſiſtance, which continued all that night vntill nigh ſeauen a clocke in the morning.</p>

               <p>The 11. day betweene ſixe and ſeauen of the clocke in the morning, the Town was throughly taken by the Kings forces, and reduced to his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dieuce,

who entred by the ſame breach which the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> had done and entred before. There were found ſlayne two hundred Wallons, three <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1590.

               <p>Foure hundred were taken priſoners. There were taken alſo foure bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen peeces, and two Canons ready charged.

               <p>There were taken alſo two hundred fat Oxen, and foure hundred ſheep, ſome killed, and ſome dreſſed, and ſome aliue, which the Knight <hi>Aumale</hi> had prouided for <hi>Paris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This exployt being atchieued, the Lord <hi>Gyury</hi> with all his companies with feruent prayers gaue thankes to God, acknowledging this deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and happie ſucceſſe to haue been the worke of his right hand and power.</p>

               <p>The Pariſiens and the Duke <hi>de Mayne</hi> were repleniſhed with rage and feare together: for they feared leaſt by the taking of <hi>Corbeil,</hi> and the retyre of the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> the ſhambles of horſes, aſſes and dogges ſhould be opened again. The Aſſes of <hi>Sorboun</hi> began to feare their ſkinne, leaſt for want of foure footed Aſſes, they ſhould be aſſaulted and brought to the ſhambles.

               <p>The ſayd King during his abode there, among other deliberations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to purſue the ſaid Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> in his retire grounded vppon iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, to wit, a wil and deſire to puniſh him who had offended, as far as God ſhould geue him power and lawfull means to do it: for as much as the D. of <hi>Parma</hi> beeing not prouoked with iniurie or vniuſt dealing, had not only againſt the law of nature maintained and aſſiſted the rebels in his realme, enemies to all iuſt and lawful ſuperiority, but alſo had committed horrible murthers and crueltyes <hi>contra ius ſupplicum,</hi> innumerable whoredoms, Sodomitries (hereditarie to the papall houſe of <hi>Pharneſes)</hi> &amp; all maner of vilanies vpon his faithful Subiects, and alſo the neceſſary defence of his eſtate and ſafety of the places, which in that countrey were vnder his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>

Harquebuziers on horſeback, who conducted the carriage of tronkes and baggage: and fearing the retyre of the enemy would haue brought him out too farre from his forces, retired in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to charge theſe companies of Harquebuziers. One of the Kings Gards beeing fallen into the enemies hands, cried for helpe: whereuppon the Baron of <hi>Biron</hi> charged them, and ſlew twelue or thirteene of them, but his horſe was killed, whereby he was put in great danger, if he had not béene reſcued by the King. This fray beeing begun, there was a great ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum geuen in the enemies campe, which began to march toward the King. But he conſidering that it was better to hazard few common ſouldiers the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Nobilitie, cauſed the companies on horſeback of the Captaines, Saint <hi>Denis</hi> and Saint <hi>Foelix</hi> to light, and to charge the enemy: there was a hot ſkirmiſh begun.</p>

               <p>When the King had paſſed <hi>Longauall</hi> toward <hi>Pontarſie,</hi> the Harquebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziers of the enemy came to the wall, and in a brauing fury ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Harquebuziers tooke their horſes, forſooke that towne, and follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed after the King, who was before to take his lodging about <hi>Pontarſy,</hi> ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated vpon the riuer <hi>Eſne</hi> beneath <hi>Pontauers,</hi> and the enemy preſently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the ſaid Towne of <hi>Longauall.</hi> Part of the Enemies followed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the King, and ſeeing a Wood betweene the ſayd <hi>Longaual</hi> and <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarſie,</hi> ſtayed there, miſtruſting ſome ambuſhes: but at length paſſing through they met with the Baron of <hi>Byron,</hi> who charged them ſo roughly with a ſmall company of horſemen, that he layed downe vpon the ground thirtie of them.</p>
               <p>The King commanded Captayne <hi>Langemis</hi> to light and ſet a freſh on them, who killed a great number of them, and then retyred into the towne of <hi>Pontarſie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The enemy went not to <hi>Pontauers</hi> that night, but encamped in the plaine field with great feare of an alarum, vnderſtanding that the Duke of

               <p>The 28. day in the morning, thirtie harquebuſiers of the enemies ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing loſt their way, went into the Towne of <hi>Longaual,</hi> enquiring for the Duke of <hi>Parmas</hi> quarter, whom the inhabitants diſarmed, and throwing them vnder the bridge drowned them.</p>

               <p>The 30. day of Nouember the King determined to did the enemie fare, well with a fight of horſemen: the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> with a good will would haue ſpared that curteſie, and bee glad to get out of the Realme without ſo much adoo.</p>
               <p>In the morning very early the ſayd Duke marched toward <hi>Marle,</hi> a towne nigh the head ſpring of the riuer <hi>Oyſe,</hi> from thence to get <hi>Larbre de Guize,</hi> and ſo to leaue the realme of <hi>France.</hi>

               <p>The King commanded all his horſemen to be in a readines, and directly to march toward <hi>Creſſie</hi> with all furniture, yet without baggage or car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.

               <p>The firſt day of December, the D. of <hi>Parma</hi> entred the dominions of the low countrey.

               <p>During this retraite, the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> was ſo diſtreſſed, that he was very greatly diſappoynted of his lodgings. As he tooke no compaſſion at <hi>Corbeil</hi> of them which ſuppliant fell before his knees: ſo pitied he no more his owne Souldiers, who could not make ſo good ſpeede in running away as he could doo, but left them to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mercie of the Peaſants of the countrey, with whom they found no more fauour then with their maſter.</p>
               <p>Of foureteene or fifteene thouſand men which he brought into <hi>France,</hi> there returned not home aboue eight thouſand, and they were in a manner in as great miſerie as their fellowes, who returned into <hi>Spayne</hi> from the conqueſt of <hi>England</hi> in the yeare 1588.</p>
               <p>The firſt day of December the King went to Saint <hi>Quintins,</hi> ſituated vpon the riuer of <hi>Oyſe,</hi> where he was royally receaued with great reioyſing and comfort of all men.

               <p>The Lord <hi>Diguieres</hi> being in <hi>Prouance</hi> with the Lord <hi>Valete,</hi> had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers letters from the King, but ſpecially in the latter end of May, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding him to warre againſt the Duke of <hi>Sauoy.</hi> But the ſaide coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey of <hi>Prouance</hi> being aſſaulted by the Leaguers of <hi>Sauoy, Lionnoys</hi> and <hi>Daulphine,</hi> he thought good yet to employ the moneths of Iune and Iuly with the Lord <hi>Valete,</hi> for the eſtabliſhing of the affayres of the ſayd <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance:</hi> wherein they had ſo good a ſucceſſe, that the enemie in token of that cowardneſſe, which their rebellion doth bréede in their hearts, aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned the townes and Caſtells of <hi>Peruis, Pumichet, Valanſele, Montignak, Soluiers, Pignauers</hi> and <hi>Lorgis:</hi> ſome were brought to the kings obedience by force, and ſome by compoſition.</p>
               <p>In Iuly during the ſoiourning of the Lorde <hi>Diguieres</hi> in <hi>Prouance;</hi> there was in <hi>Daulphine</hi> one captaine <hi>Cazete,</hi> who with intelligences which he had with the Duke of <hi>Sauoy,</hi> would haue ſould him the townes of <hi>Briancon</hi> and <hi>Eſſiles</hi> in <hi>Piemont,</hi> yet pertayning to the Dolphinate.</p>
               <p>Theſe two townes were kept by the Neutrals, that is to ſay, by them who would admit neither the K. nor the Leaguers.

               <p>At the ſame time that the Duke did batter Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> which was in the end of Auguſt, he ſent his forces of <hi>Sauoy</hi> and <hi>Piemont,</hi> beeing foure thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand footmen and three hundred horſemen into the valey of <hi>Eſsiles</hi> to ſpoyle the Countrey of <hi>Brianconoys,</hi> to batter <hi>Guyleſtre,</hi> and ouer runne <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brunoys.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Sonnes</hi> (generall of the Duke of <hi>Sauoy)</hi> had prouoked the Lord <hi>Morges</hi> his nephewe, to fight fiftie agaynſt fiftie on horſebacke, and appoynted the place: which thing the Lord <hi>Diguieres</hi> vnderſtanding, conducted the ſayd <hi>Morges</hi> vnto the place, where the ſayd <hi>Morges</hi> remayned with his forces readie to accept the offer from nine a clocke in the morning, vntill three a clocke in the euening, and at length came a Trompetter with a letter from the ſayd <hi>Sonnes</hi> carying an excuſe.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Diguieres</hi> in attending the comming of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> enemie, had eſpied a paſſage néere <hi>Iallon,</hi> where the enemie had entrenched himſelfe, and there lodged eight companies vnder the conduct of Captaine <hi>Venuſt:</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauing that there was no more hope of <hi>Sonnes</hi> comming to the combat appoynted; he determined to ſpend the reſt of that day in doing ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployt, and to aſſault the ſayd companyes, who did lye vpon the hanging of the mountayne betweene <hi>Suze</hi> and <hi>Noualize:</hi> and hauing found meanes to place one hundred Muſketters, who battered the enemie vpon the ſide of their fort, the trenches of the enemie were forced, and foureſcore of them ſlayne: among whom were Captaynes <hi>Venuſt, Gaſſard</hi> and <hi>Charband:</hi> Captayne <hi>Vilars</hi> with ſome other was taken priſoners, and foure compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of <hi>Senton</hi> (maſter of the Campe) were ſo ſcattered, that they came ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="October"/> together agayne.

               <p>This being done, the Lord <hi>Diguieres</hi> returned again to <hi>Eſſiles,</hi> and ſent backe the foure Canons to <hi>Ambrun,</hi> and cauſed two great peeces to bee drawne from <hi>Gap</hi> to <hi>Barcelona,</hi> a place ſituated in the County of <hi>Nice,</hi> and pertayning to the Duke of <hi>Sauoy,</hi> hee ſent his forces before to beſiege the ſayd <hi>Barcelona:</hi> and when hee came himſelfe about the eleauenth day of October, and had made a breach, the ſame day the enemie did parley, and

yéelded themſelues with ſafetie of their liues, leauing behind them their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, colours, horſes and baggage: the Captaines were permitted to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1590.

               <p>The 13. day the gouernour called <hi>Coreloere</hi> departed with three ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers with him, and as many of citizens and countrey men who repayred to their houſes vnder the Kings ſafegard.</p>
               <p>The 14. day the Lord <hi>Diguieres</hi> layd batterie before the Caſtle of <hi>Metans,</hi> which he ſlenderly battered the 15. day, only to view the enemies countenance. But they being greatly afrayed, the next night did ſteale a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and ſo ſaued themſelues, except thirtie of them, who were intercepted by the watch.</p>
               <p>In this way of <hi>Piemont,</hi> the Lord <hi>Diguieres</hi> had neuer aboue three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred horſes and twelue hundred ſhot, and found no greater enemie then the inacceſſible height of the mountaynes, where ouer he was forced to paſſe the Canon, but chiefly in his iourney to <hi>Barcelona.</hi>

               <p>The Citie of <hi>Grenoble</hi> in the land of <hi>Daulphine,</hi> notwithſtanding the truces and good entertaynment from time to time receaued of the Lord <hi>Diguieres,</hi> had been ſeduced after the King laſt deceaſed, and did hold ſtill after for the League, though not with ſuch deſperat madnes and inſolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie as many others had done.</p>

               <p>Fiftly, that the cuſtodie and gouernment of the ſaid towne ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the Kings good pleaſure, who ſhall be requeſted to prouide it of ſuch a gouernour, and ſo ſufficient garriſon as he ſhall thinke meete for his ſeruice, and the preſeruation of the towne.</p>
               <p>Item, that in the meane time as the Lord <hi>Arbucy,</hi> hitherto gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the ſayd towne, vpon ſome conſiderations, cannot as yet reſolue to take that oath, that the ſayd place ſhall remayne in gouernance of the Lord <hi>Rochegiron,</hi> and that the Lord <hi>Arbucy</hi> ſhall haue three moneths reſpit to reſolue vpon the ſame oath: which thing if hee doth, the King ſhall bee requeſted to graunt him againe the gouernment of the ſame towne.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, that generally all the inhabitants of whatſoeuer calling or degrée they bee, ſhall ſtand diſcharged and acquited of all leuying of the kings impoſt or coynes, bearing of armes, treaties and practizes, euen with Forreiners, or any other acts of hoſtilitie, and that the Lord <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guieres</hi> hath vndertaken, within two moneths to deliuer vnto them ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient

               <p>Seuenthly, that the memorie of all the offences paſt in all theſe trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1590.

               <p>Eightly, that for a more perfect vnion of the hearts of the Kings ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, the Lords of the court of Parliament, who by the Kings com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement had retired, and are yet reſident at <hi>Rouan,</hi> or elſewhere, ſhall returne with conuenient ſpeede to <hi>Grenoble,</hi> there to follow and continue their charges.</p>

               <p>Now Chriſtian reader, I beſeech thée to conſider, both the euident and ſencible mercie and iuſtice of God, &amp; the difference which is betwéene the veſſels of glory &amp; of wrath: for this honourable L. <hi>des Diguieres</hi> in all the wars of <hi>Daulphine,</hi> euer ſince the riſing of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> execrable League, hath neuer ſhewed any point of crueltie vpon his enemies, in which there might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare any ſmall token of particular anger, or appetite of reuenge: but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies hath ſhewed good &amp; gracious entertainme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, euen vnto the very ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, in whom he hath marked ſome ſimple dealing, &amp; had not vſed any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ormities or proud inſole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cies. If he hath ſhewed ſomtime ſome extremity, yet did he neuer ſo much as he might haue iuſtly done, &amp; hath knowen in ſuch, alwaies ſome notable iniuries, which he w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a iuſt &amp; prudent wiſdome hath thought to haue deſerued ſome ſharpe puniſhment. To be ſhort, it may bée ſayd of him, <hi>In conſilijs ſapiens &amp; prouidus, in aci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> fortis, in pace &amp; foederibus, iuſtus fidus &amp; conſtans.</hi> Therefore the Lord hath guided his armes, hath made him victorious in all conflicts and méetings, and hath endued him with ſuch ſtrength of the bodie, as beyond all expectation, to haue ſurmounted the inacceſſible <hi>Alpes,</hi> and at length hath not onely ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed and rooted out the naturall rebells of the countrey, out of <hi>Daul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phine</hi> and <hi>Prouance,</hi> their confederates of <hi>Spayne, Italy</hi> and <hi>Piemont,</hi> but with an incredible felicitie, hath reſtored the afflicted ſtate of that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and eſtabliſhed peace, iudgement and iuſtice.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, whereas it is the dutie of Chriſtian Princes, not to rauiſh other mens kingdomes, to enuade their landes and principalities, to robbe, ſpoyle and murder their borderers and neighbours: but to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uern their Dominions in peace, with piety, iuſtice and diſcipline, to liue
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:8966:267"/>
friendly with their Neighbours, but ſpecially to relieue other Eſtates af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, to aſſiſt Princes neighbours, when through diſobedience and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1590.

               <p>But it fell ſo otherwiſe with <hi>France:</hi> for when through the ſinnes of the people, and euill counſell of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, the Kingdome was ſo torne with diſſentions and rebellions, that it ſeemed as in a ſhipwrack the pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces did flye abroad, expoſed to euery man that could catch &amp; hold. Firſt the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> (who had beene this day a Muſcleman, and not a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, if it had not beene for the kinges of <hi>France)</hi> with his Gold thought to haue all.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Duke of <hi>Sauoy</hi> (who whithout the goodnes of the <hi>Valoys,</hi> had beene a pety and a poore Duke) made his reckoning to goe away with the Prouinces of <hi>Daulphin</hi> and <hi>Prouance,</hi> bordering vpon him, for his part.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Duke <hi>de Mayne</hi> (who without the gratious fauour of the <hi>Valoys,</hi> had layn obſcure in the Mountains of <hi>Lorrein,</hi> there a digging for braſſe in the cauerns thereof) made his accampt of ſome ſcambling among the other, as to haue carried away all that bordereth to <hi>Lorreyn: d' Aumale</hi> made his reckoning of <hi>Picardie,</hi> and <hi>Merccur</hi> of <hi>Britayn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſt of all, Fryer <hi>Sixtus,</hi> and after him Fryer <hi>Gregorie</hi> the fourtéenth thought by theſe meanes to maintayne their tyrannie in that Realme. All theſe I ſay were ſo farre from dooing the duties of Chriſtian Princes and Paſtors of the Church, in aſſiſting the right owner of the Crowne, and in preſeruing that Realme, as one of the chiefeſt members and ornament of <hi>Europe,</hi> that euen as the Edomites in the ſacking of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> cried<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>downe with it, downe with it euen to the ground: ſo haue they not in words but in kindling and nouriſhing the flame of rebellion, &amp; aſſaulting by all meanes the ſaid Realme, haue encreaſed the plagues and multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſorrowes of that aflicted ſtate.</p>
               <p>Therefore behold the Lord hath accurſed their armes, and as for the Duke of <hi>Sauoy</hi> his owne hand hath weakened him, ſo that he durſt neuer come to ſee the ſaid Lord <hi>Diguieres</hi> in the face one way, but he is gone out of the field ſeauen waies. He did neuer in all theſe warres any thing with valour, but by treachery and treaſons, as the taking of <hi>Carmagnole,</hi> and his practiſes in <hi>Prouance</hi> doo teſtify: thouſands of his moſt approoued and ſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Souldiours and Captains haue béen killed by few, not only in their inuaſions attempted in <hi>Daulphine</hi> &amp; <hi>Prouance,</hi> but alſo at home, where the ſaid Lord <hi>Diguieres</hi> hath forced their ſtrong holds, hath put them to the ſword, and caſt their carcaſes on their mountains to bee meat for the beaſts of the field, and fowles of the ayre. See therefore how contrarie licours do flow out of contrary veſſels, and how the Lord protecteth the vertuous and iuſt, according to his promiſe, and clotheth the wicked with calamity, ſhame and diſhonor, as with a Cloude.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Haue declared in the former booke thoſe euents which happened in the yeare 1590. and how the King conducted very curteouſly the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> if he would haue taken it ſo, and how the ſayd King retyred to Saint <hi>Quintin</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of December 1590. but what courſe he tooke, nor what coaſt he followed I haue nothing to ſpeake of for lacke of inſtructions, except wee may gather ſome thing by the euents.</p>
               <p>It ſeemeth therefore, that the King after he had ſoiorned ſome dayes in <hi>Picardie,</hi> hee returned to his army which he had leftin <hi>Normandie,</hi> where he tooke aduiſe concerning the citie of <hi>Chartres,</hi> great, mighty, ſtrong and riche, ſituated in the countrey of <hi>Beauſſe.</hi> This is that Citie whereunto K. <hi>Henry</hi> the third ſoiorned for a time after hee was put to flight from <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> in May 1588. This Citie is ancient and famous for the ancient ſuperſtition of the Druides, &amp; in our dayes for the renowmed Idoll of our <hi>Ladie</hi> of <hi>Chartres:</hi> that Citie hath been therefore both with the Pagans, &amp; with the Romaniſts a ſeat of moſt damnable Idolatrie, and of late one of them which rebelled firſt of all agaynſt <hi>Henry</hi> the third after the death of the Duke of <hi>Guyze,</hi> and had continued ſtill in the ſame rebellion.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of Ianuary therefore the King hauing prepared all thinges, determined to wreſt this Citie out of the tyrannous bondage of Leaguers, and to enforce the ſame to returne to theyr dutie.</p>
               <p>And for lacke of inſtructions of al the notable exploits done in that ſiege, wee haue to ſhew two things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, of a ſtratagem vſed by the King: and ſecondly of the yeelding of the ſame.</p>
               <p>This town of <hi>Chartres</hi> is very ſtrong both by art &amp; nature, yet was it not very well prouided of Souldiers beſides the Citizens and Towneſmen.</p>
               <p>After that the King, acompanied with his owne forces and the Marſhal <hi>Biron,</hi> hauing laine long time about the ſaid <hi>Chartres,</hi> came to his campe, he perceaued that it would be very difficult to obtaine the ſame by force: therfore he aduiſed himſelfe to prooue what might be done by ſtratagem.
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:8966:268"/>
And about the fourtéenth of Februarie he ſeperated himſelfe from the Marſhall <hi>Biron,</hi> and faining to geue ouer that ſiege, marched towardes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1590. Februarie"/> 
                  <hi>Dreux,</hi> geuing out that hee would goe to beſiege the ſame, and went but thrée miles from the ſaid <hi>Chartres.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Marſhall <hi>Biron</hi> in like manner ſéemed the next day (which was the fiftéenth of the ſaide moneth) to raiſe vp the ſiege, and to followe the King, as though he diſpaired to doe any good there.</p>
               <p>They of <hi>Chartres</hi> with ſuch forces as they had, ſeeing that, reſolued themſelues to make a ſally, and to ſet vpon the rereward of the Marſhall <hi>Biron,</hi> as hee was marching toward <hi>Dreux:</hi> vpon this determination they iſſued out of the towne, and roughly charged the Marſhals hinder troups.</p>
               <p>The Marſhall firſt ſeemed to make head againſt them, but ſoone after began to retire himſelfe, geuing place to the enemies.</p>
               <p>The enemies followed him amayne continually ſkirmiſhing, vntill they came about two miles from the Towne.</p>
               <p>In the meane time the King lying in ambuſh, when he ſaw his time got betweene the Towne and the men thereof that followed the Marſhall of <hi>Biron,</hi> and ſo couragiouſly charged them behind: and the Marſhall turning his face towards them agayne, that in leſſe then an hower that they fought he ſlew them all, except thirty cuiraſſes which hardly eſcaped.</p>
               <p>The King following the victorie, entred preſently one of the Suburbs of <hi>Chartres.</hi> The towneſmen ſeeing this, began to make a motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of peace with him, and offered to deliuer him the towne, &amp; fiftie thouſand crownes, vpon condition that hee would remooue his forces, and place no garriſon therein: which the King refuſed to doo, and thereupon prepared to batter the towne in two places, hauing reſolued not to leaue it vntill he were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of it.</p>
               <p>For lacke of inſtructions we omit here many particularities &amp; exployts valiantly performed at that ſiege. During the which ſiege, the inhabitants (enforced by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rebellious Leaguers which were many) ſhewed themſelues very malicious and obſtinate agaynſt him, refuſing to acknowledge him for their Soueraigne, with threatnings and breathing out moſt vnreue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent and vnnaturall ſpeaches agaynſt him.</p>
               <p>The King in that ſiege hauing made diuers times many breaches, gaue aſſaults vpon them, which they endured with great loſſes, vntill they ſaw theyr walls wonderouſly battered and beaten downe to the playn ground. Then offered they diuers times to yeeld vp vppon certayne conditions. But the King anſwered, that it was for him to giue them lawe, and for them to receaue it at his hands.</p>
               <p>The King did delay the ſharpnes of warre, hoping through conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the extreame daunger, to bring them to reaſon and duetie. But when that would not preuaile, about the 16. day of April there was a great
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:8966:268"/>
and terrible aſſault giuen, which the inhabitants notwithſtanding ſuſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but very hardly and with great loſſe. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1590. Aprill"/>
               </p>
               <p>The wiſeſt and beſt ſort of the inhabitants, conſidering that it was in vayne to with ſtand the King, and that in fewe ſuch feaſts all their citizens might bee ſpent, and yet the King neuertheleſſe would enioy the Citie by force, which would redound to their extreame perrill, agreed to yéeld them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to his gracious clemencie.</p>
               <p>There was a great number of Leaguers within the Citie, who vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of this reſolution, ſhewed themſelues greatly offended at it, threatning the reſt that they would make them repent that euer they went about ſuch matter.</p>
               <p>The reſt of the citizens ſéeing this diſcontentation of the Leaguers, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented that the ſayd Leaguers who were ſo obſtinately bent and ſo hot in the cauſe, at the next aſſault ſhould defend the breach. So the eight day a newe aſſault being giuen ſo hot, that a great number of them were there throughly cooled, and the reſt glad to retire and giue ouer, and with the reſt without any further diſputation did ſubmit themſelues, perceauing now that the League did nothing els but ſeeke the ruine and deſtruction of the countrey, and that in vayne they did reſiſt him whom God had ſayd ſhould raigne ouer them. Therefore they agreed to ſend to his maieſtie, offering to acknowledge him their onely King and Soueraigne, and to craue par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for their diſobedience and vnnaturall rebellion, yéelding themſelues and their Citie to his accuſtomed gracious mercie.</p>
               <p>The King graunted their petition, and hauing ſeazed vpon the Citie by ſuch as were appoynted by his maieſtie, with his Princes and Nobles prepared to enter the towne.</p>
               <p>The ninth day of Aprill the citizens conſidering with thankfull mindes the Kings great and gracious fauour, who might haue had conquered them by force, and by lawe of armes iuſtly taken away from them their lands and goods, and for their rebellion put them to the ſword; they I ſay prepared themſelues in their degrees to attend his Maieſties comming. Firſt the whole Cleargie went before in their attyre and order: next vnto them the Magiſtrates with their robes, and after them the Citizens follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed euery man according to his place, and all falling downe vppon their knees before the King, did acknowledge him their Soueraigne with this acclamation: God ſaue <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Bourbon</hi> our mercifull and gracious King, long may he liue the noble King of <hi>France,</hi> with great reuerence and ſubmiſſion crauing pardon, and ſhewing themſelues ſorrowfull for their rebellion and offences committed agaynſt his maieſtie.</p>
               <p>The King conſidering their repentance and ſubmiſſion, pardoned them with louing, gracious and comfortable words: whereupon were the keyes of their citie deliuered him, who receaued them with amiable countenance.
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:8966:269"/>
Theſe things being done, the Citizens marching before, the Magiſtrates after, and the Cleargie following them, conducted the King and his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1590. Aprill"/> in moſt triumphant ſort to his lodging, the people ſaluting him all the way with this acclamation: Long liue <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Bourbon</hi> King of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Nauarre.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is ſayd before, how the Lord <hi>Diguieres</hi> had pacified <hi>Daulphine,</hi> hath aſſaulted the Duke of <hi>Sauoy</hi> abroad and at home.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Sauoy</hi> ſéeing himſelfe hardly matched, aduiſed how to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt the ſayd Lord <hi>Diguieres,</hi> ſent to his good maſter the King of <hi>Spayne</hi> to bee reuenged: therefore they tooke this aduiſe, to ſend foure hundred light horſes of <hi>Naples,</hi> with ſome of the beſt of the olde garriſons there, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Piemont,</hi> which by reaſon of the ſwiftnes of their horſes, ſhould moleſt the land of <hi>Daulphine</hi> with daily courſes, roades and inuaſions.</p>
               <p>Theſe foure hundred Neapolitanes hauing taken counſell how to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the land of <hi>Daulphine</hi> with a ſwift pace, had not determined with what pace they ſhould get out. They therefore ranne as ſwift as their horſes could goe as farre as the fort <hi>Bowe,</hi> where the Lord <hi>Diguieres</hi> méeting ſtayed them ſo, that they are not like to goe euer to <hi>Naples</hi> agayne, to tell newes vnto their Curtizans of their light horſes being there all ſlayne, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a fewe excepted.</p>
               <p>There it appeared to them, that the beſt warre is not in <hi>Italy,</hi> nor the beſt ſouldiour of <hi>Naples,</hi> and that there is a great difference betweene the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier trayned vp in Militarie Diſcipline, and daily employed to great and waightie affayres, and him who vnder the name of ſouldier is moulten in filthie pleaſures in the Stewes of Curtizans, as theſe were. There ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared alſo how the horſe is but a vayne thing to ſaue a man in an vniuſt cauſe, and that they were but robbers who came to ſpoyle and moleſt them that had neuer proffered them wrong. This exployt was done about the beginning of March, as I can coniecture.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Digueres</hi> hauing cut ſhort thoſe inſolent Italians, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to purſue ſome forces which were retiring out of <hi>Daulphine</hi> into <hi>Sauoy</hi> againe, whome hee followed ſo ſhort, that hee entred the citie of <hi>Chamberie,</hi> Metropolitan of <hi>Sauoy.</hi> This is a great Citie, famous for the ſtraunge Idolatrie vſed in the ſame: There is an olde filthy ragge, ſome gowtie clowt of ſome gowtie Frier, they haue made the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue (ſuch is the ſpirit of Idolatrie in them that know not God, and ſuch is the ſpirit of Auarice in them that applie religions to gaine) that it was the ſhrowd wherein Chriſt was buried, therefore certaine times of the yeare, there was a reſort of inf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

hauing not forces ſufficient to munit and keepe it, left it, and returned <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1591"/> home with a fat ſpoyle, without any loſſe.</p>

               <p>All things beeing in a readines, and the time come to worke, the Lord <hi>Dampuis</hi> came vnto the gate with his companies according to promiſe, harkening to heare the watch word, and to bee admitted into the Citie by the complices.</p>

               <p>About the ſelfe ſame time the Countie of <hi>Carces</hi> had wrought another ſuch practiſe alſo againſt the Towne of <hi>Tolon,</hi> by the treaſon of the chiefeſt Conſull and other Townes men, which was in like maner diſcouered, and the conſpiratours apprehended and chaſtiſed.</p>

               <p>The Citie of <hi>Marſeilles</hi> is an ancient Colonie of the Greckes named <hi>Phocoei,</hi> who forſook their countrey, when <hi>Cyrus</hi> king of the Perſians did war and ſubdue <hi>Aſia</hi> the leſſer, that citie had been commended in the time of the Romans, by reaſon of learning and good diſcipline which floriſhed there.

               <p>For as in the ancient time <hi>Alexandria</hi> and <hi>Sicilia</hi> were the Nurces of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſo the countrey of <hi>Beauſſe</hi> and this Citie of <hi>Chartres</hi> were the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt prouiders for the Cittie of <hi>Paris.</hi> Now therefore the carriage of any kind of victuals and prouiſions beeing ſtopped both aboue and beneath the riuer, from the North ſide and the South, and finding themſelues deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of victuals, money, and all other warlike prouiſions for their ſtrength and ſuccour, they fall to their olde cuſtome: that is, to demaund bread of their Idols: therefore the Biſhop of <hi>Placentia,</hi> their Fryer <hi>Gregory</hi> the thirteenth his Legat, after the returne home of Fryer <hi>Henrico Caietano, Sponte inſanientes inſtigat,</hi> ſet them on to running and gadding about the ſtreetes, to carry their Idols with <hi>or a pro nobis,</hi> there is mourning, wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>About the fiftéenth day, the armie remoued to <hi>Dourdan,</hi> which towne immediately his armie entred by force, where was found great ſtore of victualls gathered, with intent to be conueighed to <hi>Paris.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>But for all the Kings ſecret and ſudden departure, yet by that time he had paſſed fiue miles, he vnderſtoode that his comming vpon coniecture being blazed among the enemies, they had fled and paſſed beyond the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer <hi>Marne,</hi> with great amaze and terror: this is according to the ſaying of the wiſe, that ſayth: that the Kings countenance ſcattereth the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.</p>
               <p>The 22. of Aprill, the King from <hi>Creſpij</hi> where he was returned, tooke his way to <hi>Chauny,</hi> intending to take the Caſtles of <hi>Manican</hi> and <hi>Genlis:</hi> and for the better effecting of his purpoſe, he cauſed two great Canons of Ordinance to be brought from <hi>Compiegne.</hi> But they who were in <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> Caſtle did not attende but left the place, and fled before hee arriued there.</p>
               <p>The 24. of Aprill, the King cauſed the ſaid Ordinance and more which was brought from S. <hi>Quintins,</hi> to bee brought before <hi>Genlis:</hi> but at the ſight of the Ordinance the ſayd Caſtle of <hi>Genlis</hi> yéelded vnto the King.</p>
               <p>About the ſame time, two regiments of garriſons of the Leaguers were repayring to the Duke <hi>de Mayne,</hi> whereof the Kings garriſon of Saint <hi>Goubin</hi> hauing intelligence, iſſued foorth vpon them and put many to the ſword.</p>
               <p>The Duke <hi>de Mayne</hi> had receaued ſeauen companies of Germanes, being nine Enſignes, who moſt wickedly as Mercenaries and ſlaues to their owne couetouſneſſe, had for money conſented to defend one of the moſt notable Rebellions that euer had béen, hated of God, and deteſted of all good Princes of the world.</p>
               <p>Them the Duke <hi>de Mayne</hi> in the diuiſion of his armie, as is aboue ſaid, had placed in certayne Villages betweene the riuers of <hi>Marne</hi> and <hi>Oyſe,</hi> intending to place them in <hi>Meaulx</hi> and <hi>Soyſſons:</hi> and as they marched they came to <hi>Couſſie,</hi> where they ſuppoſed to bee receaued: but the gates of the towne being kept faſt agaynſt them, and hearing a rumour of the Kings comming, ſuch a ſudden feare fell vpon them, that they fiercely ranne into the Foreſt, hoping thereby to ſaue themſelues.</p>
               <p>The garriſon of S. <hi>Goubin</hi> hearing of this amaze of the enemie, ſent fifcie men on horſebacke, conducted onely by a Sargeant, went foorth, and taking about foureſcore peaſants of the countrey with them, marched into the Foreſt.</p>
               <p>This ſmall company was greatly encouraged, by hearing of the arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uall

               <p>About 29. of Aprill, the Lord <hi>Humiers</hi> knowing that the companie of horſemen of <hi>Mountcaure</hi> had aſſembled in a Village not farre from <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beil,</hi> departed out of the ſayd Towne of <hi>Corbeil</hi> to charge them.

               <p>The L. <hi>Tremblay</hi> hauing ſpeedy intelligence of that which was paſt in <hi>Monconter,</hi> tooke his iourney with 50 light horſemen, reſolued with that ſmall companie to enter into the Caſtell with ladders, which he perfour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.

               <p>Whileſt theſe preparations were a making, the Lord Saint <hi>Laurence,</hi> Marſhall of the army of the rebels vnder <hi>Merceur,</hi> had entred into <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conter</hi> with three hundred horſemen well appointed, and one thouſand Harquebuziers, intending to fortife that towne agaynſt the King.</p>
               <p>But in the meane while, the King in proper perſon with ſixe ſcore horſes onely had marched ſo farre as <hi>Londiak,</hi> intending to ſearch out the enemy.</p>
               <p>The Lord Saint <hi>Laurence</hi> aduertiſed of the Kings comming, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that there was muſtering round about, knowing in his conſcience the Kings iuſt cauſe and wiſedome, and miſtruſting the quarel of his ſide, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued a great terrour, and perceaued to haue caſt himſelfe ſo deeply into the Mire, that if pollicy doth not plucke him out, hee is like there to ſticke faſt a good while. Therefore conſidering the ſmall company which was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the King, determined to aſſault him with many: and for to bring to paſſe this his intent, ſuppoſing the better to depart fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>Monconter</hi> in time, then to enioy it a while to his great domage: he departed from <hi>Monconter</hi> about 11. a clocke in the euening with two hundred and fifty horſemen, and ſixe hundred Harquebuziers, and trauelling all night came to <hi>Londiak</hi> by ſixe a clocke in the morning, beeing the twelft day of May.</p>
               <p>The King being at <hi>Londiak,</hi> &amp; vnderſtanding of the enemies co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming, delayed no time, but went immediatly to the field to receaue the ſaid ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie. The enemie perceauing the K. to haue determined to bid him battel, &amp; to be already in the field, left part of his footmen to force the trenches &amp; barricadoes of <hi>Londiak:</hi> and this being done, the enemie brought his horſemen and part of his footmen into the field to encounter the King, there he deuided his companies into two troups, in the one there was fiftie horſemen, and in the other two hundred. The King had but ſix ſcore horſemen, whome he deuided likewiſe into two troupes, in the one thirty, and in the other <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The King hauing ſet few foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in battaile array, called with a feruent prayer vpon the name of the GOD of armies, and cheered vp his ſouldiers, encouraging them to ſhew themſelues men, in defending ſuch a iuſt cauſe as they had in hand,
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:8966:273"/>
which being done both armies ioyned, and the enemie hauing made a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſmall reſiſtance, was ſtrooken with a ſodaine terrour, as if it were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1591.

The Kings Souldiers perceauing this ſodaine dread vpon the enemie, gaue ſuch a freſh and hot charge, that they turned their backs and fled. The King purſued them two miles from <hi>Londiak,</hi> to a towne holden by their fauourers, where theſe horſemen ſaued themſelues. There were fiftie horſemen ſlayne, as many more taken priſoners, many footmen ſlaine on the place, and many both horſemen and footmen wounded. The reſt of the footemen ſaued themſelues by flight into the woods which were neere at hand, and there hid themſelues. Lo how there is neither ſtrength nor counſell againſt the Lorde: Lo howe the wicked is ſnared in his owne counſell.</p>
               <p>The news of this foyle being blazed abroad throughout the enemies troups, came alſo to <hi>Monconter,</hi> by meanes whereof there roſe ſuch a ſudaine feare among them, that immediatly they retyred from the ſaide <hi>Monconter</hi> with al poſſible ſpeed, leauing the town frée from any ſtrength of the enemie.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Tremblay</hi> being in the Caſtell, and moleſting the enemies daylie by ſallies and ſlaughters of them as is ſayd, ſeing how wonderfully God had terrified that rebellious route, went foorth of the Caſtell with his forces, followed them, and immediatly charged them ſo roughly, that they were all ſlayne and taken priſoners, by meanes whereof hee got both bagge and baggage from the enemie: So was that accurſed company (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies of mankind) vtterly rooted out.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid before how the Lord <hi>D'ombes</hi> had gone from <hi>Renes</hi> into haſe <hi>Britaine</hi> to a Towne called <hi>Quinpercorenten,</hi> and in departing out of the ſayd Towne to returne to <hi>Renes,</hi> the garriſons of the enemies in townes about holden by them, charged vpon the ſayd Prince, but were ſo receaued by him, that there was ſlaine of the enemies ſide three Captayns of name and of great eſtimation among the Rebels, ſeauen gentlemen of great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count were taken priſoners, all the reſt in the purſuite were put to the ſword.</p>
               <p>Here thou mayſt ſee (Chriſtian Reader) that all theſe blowes, ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and ouerthrowes euery where receaued, cannot make theſe damned rebels conſider the wrongfulnes of the cauſe, which ſo obſtinatly agaynſt all lawes of nations, agaynſt nature and agaynſt God they do defend.</p>

But they that came from <hi>Diepe</hi> gaue ſuch a hot charge vpon them, that all thoſe horſemen were ſo ſlaine, that none of them eſcaped any way.

               <p>The Lord <hi>Chartres</hi> ſeeing that moſt honourable reſolution of Sir <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> was wonderfully encouraged to the enterpriſe: and thereupon prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted to take part alſo in the ſayd attempt with his foure hundred Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, whatſoeuer ſhould chaunce: and therevpon diſplayed his Enſigne, and together with Sir <hi>Roger</hi> vowed (by Gods aſſiſtance) to enter the
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:8966:274"/>
Barricadoes and to charge the enemie.</p>
               <p>The ſayd Lord vpon this reſolution chéered vp his Souldiers, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1591. May"/> them to fight in the behalfe of their lawful King, whoſe right they were bound to defend, and God doubtles will proſper the ſame to the confuſion of his enemies.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Roger</hi> in like ſort, like a true Chriſtian Knight, encouraged his Souldiers, ſhewing vnto them, that although fewe of their ſide haue to deale with a great multitude ſkilfull, ſtout, hardie, and trayned vp in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall Diſcipline: yet conſidering y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their cauſe is but an execrable rebellion agaynſt their Soueraigne, they are but a multitude of traytors, oppoſing themſelues to Gods ordinance, therfore condemned of God to a ſhamefull death, both here and in the world to come. He aſſured them that God will aſſiſt them in the execution of his ſentence pronounced agaynſt them: hée alleaged the common experience in all ages and Nations: hee concluded that the God of battailes will ſo fight for them, that their eyes ſhall haue their deſire vpon them, as vpon enemies of God, of man, ſocietie and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. He aſſureth them, that in putting their confidence in GOD, not one haire of their heads ſhall fall: which when hee had finiſhed to ſpeake, hee prayeth vnto the Lord with great confidence. And when he had ended pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer, he made them to promiſe each vnto other to die euery man rather then they would flye one foote.</p>
               <p>Theſe things being done, they marched forward with great courage, diſplayed their Enſignes, ſtrooke vp their Drummes, &amp; with their Trom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets ſounded defiance, and with this reſolution full of confidence, theſe va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant Engliſh Souldiers gaue a fierce charge vpon the enemie, and aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them in ſuch ſort, as if they had not trauailed all night. This fight con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued two houres ſpace, the Engliſh men ſtill hartening the Frenchmen. At length they entred the Barricadoes of the enemie. Sir <hi>Roger</hi> being one of the formoſt fought hand to hand with the chiefeſt gouernours of the enemies. The gouernour of <hi>Deepe</hi> on another ſide entring, did valiant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly behaue himſelfe: at length the enemie began to recoyle backe, and being all encloſed within their Barricadoes, as a flocke of ſheepe in a Shéepcot, were all put to the ſword by the Engliſh and Frenchmen, ſuffering none to eſcape aliue.</p>
               <p>Hauing obtayned this wonderfull victorie, vpon their knees in the ſame place, gaue thankes vnto GOD which had ſubdued their enemies vnder foote, and with ſinging of Pſalmes gaue the praiſe vnto the higheſt.</p>
               <p>All that the Gouernour and Sir <hi>Roger Williams</hi> loſt, were not aboue eleauen men, and fewe wounded, but not very grieuouſly.</p>
               <p>This exployt being ſo proſperouſly done, the Generals tooke order not to ſtay there at any hand, but ſpeedily to returne to <hi>Deepe,</hi> leaſt ſome newe freſh ſupply ſhould come from <hi>Roan</hi> vpon them, or by caſting about ſhould

               </p>
               <p>The Souldiers obeying the counſell of their Commander, tooke no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but that which was light and eaſie of carriage. Thus ſafely they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to <hi>Deepe.</hi> The enemie as it was ſuppoſed came with a great po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to meet them in the middeſt of the high way: but they had paſſed foure houres before, and ſo the enemie diſappoynted of his purpoſe returned backe.</p>
               <p>Wee haue ſhewed before how the King hauing had a proſperous ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe in chaſtiſing the Rebells in <hi>Picardie,</hi> went in perſon into <hi>Britaine,</hi> where likewiſe God proſpered his wayes.</p>
               <p>Whileſt the King was in <hi>Britaine,</hi> his armie ſoiourned for a time at <hi>Vernon,</hi> wayting to ſurpriſe the towne of <hi>Louiers,</hi> ſituated vpon the riuer <hi>Eure</hi> betweene <hi>Pont de larche</hi> and <hi>Eureux.</hi> The particularities of this ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe could I neuer heare, but ſuch as the King himſelfe did write vnto the Prince <hi>Countie,</hi> Gouernour for his Maieſtie in <hi>Anjou, Vendomoys, Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reyne, Poytow, Berry</hi> and <hi>Limoſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſixt day of Iune, ten of the Kings men poſſeſſed themſelues with one of the gates of the towne, and as it is reported by others in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
               <p>There was a certayne Corporall in that Citie, who was in great cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit with the gouernour of that towne called <hi>Fonteyne Martel.</hi> This Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall conſidering the great wrong which the Rebels did to the King, and deſirous to doo to his Maieſtie ſome ſeruice of import, practiſed that there ſhould be at ſeuerall times by ſixe at once, a number of footmen and horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſent into the Wood hard adioyning to the towne, and in the meane time hauing woon to himſelfe foure or fiue Souldiers of his owne compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, his time came of his watch.</p>
               <p>About noone day the ſayd gouernour being at dinner, and according to his ſigne giuen there came certaine horſemen of the Kings, which he eſpy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing went preſently to the gouernour who had the keyes lying on the table by him, and ſayd he marueiled that they ſat ſo long at dinner, ſhewing that there were ſome friends come vnto him. The gouernour commaunded the ſayd Corporall to take the key and let them enter, which he did.</p>
               <p>The King had cauſed the Baron of <hi>Byron</hi> to come néere with his forces, who ſoone alſo entred therein.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fonteyne Martel</hi> had one hundred Cuiraſſes in that towne, beſide the inhabitants, who obſtinatly made a ſtrong reſiſtance to the King, which was cauſe of a terrible fight.</p>
               <p>The King himſelfe made one of the gates of the Citie to yeeld to him, whereto moſt part of the men of warr and the inhabitants withdrew them<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelues

               <p>There was found great quantitie of Corne, Wine and Bacon, beſide other munitions, and as the report is, foure thouſand fat Oxen in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes.

               <p>At the ſelfeſame time that this exployt was done at <hi>Louiers,</hi> the Lord ſent proſperous ſucceſſe to the Kings affayres in other countreys.</p>
               <p>The Vicount <hi>de la Guerche,</hi> a moſt wicked rebell in <hi>Limoſin,</hi> had greatly troubled the Kings peace in that countrey, and about the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Iune had beſieged <hi>Belak,</hi> (a towne in <hi>Lymoſin,</hi> famous in that countrey, for making a kinde of rough cloth like vnto Iriſh rugge) with two Canons, one Culuerine and a baſtard péece of Ordinaunce.</p>
               <p>The Prince <hi>Countie</hi> being come into <hi>Poytow</hi> with an armie for the Kings ſeruice, to purge that countrey beyond <hi>Loyre,</hi> of the oppreſſion and tyranny of ſome remnants of rebels which were ſpoyling that countrey, and being aduertized of the ſaid ſiege of <hi>Belak,</hi> marched directly thither to rayſe the ſiege, or to bid battaile to the ſaid Vicount, if he durſt ſtay his comming.</p>

               <p>The aſſault being ſtayed, and the agreement concluded vpon the promiſe of the ſayd Generall: the nobilitie moſt willingly, and of their owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord did yeeld themſelues, and ſwore obedience to the King, promiſing to withdraw themſelues preſently euery man to his own houſe, &amp; to be ready to ſerue the King in any his buſines, and payed fifteene thouſand crowns, and the Citie 25. thouſand, which was farre leſſe then they did think they ſhould haue payed.</p>

               <p>From thence the Duke ſent a trompeter to the Prince, about certaine priſoners taken at <hi>Corlay,</hi> who ſignified to the ſayde Prince, that hee had charge from the Duke to entreate him to appoynt ſome day and place for the battaile.</p>

               <p>The Prince on the other ſide, put his troups in order within the heath, and by the aduiſe of Sir <hi>Ihon Norris</hi> diſpoſeth the ſame in three battails, wherof the Engliſh footemen made two, and the Launceknights the third: that day was ſpent in light ſkirmiſhes, wherin the Princes men followed the enemie euen into the maine of their armie.</p>
               <p>The eleuenth day the enemie drew his armie to the foote of the hill, and placed his artillerie vpon the ſide of the heath, in a place of ſuch aduantage, as commaunded the whole heath, and bordreth all the hedges with ſhotte.</p>
               <p>By that time the enemie had done all theſe things, the Princes armie marched into the heath in order of battaile, and preſently ſent two hundred footemen to view the enemies countenaunce, whome they charged, put them from their hedges and barricadoes, and ſlew diuers of them.</p>

               <p>During this ſkirmiſh, there was a great number of ſhot placed vnder the hedges, which hauing meanes to doe hurte, ſtoode quiet as though they had fallen aſleepe, or elſe had béen placed there onely to keepe the hedges, leaſt the Prince ſhould come to cut them downe and cary them away.</p>

The Prince ſtayed ſixe dayes vpon the Heath, and in the meane while the enemie durſt neuer preſume to draw his armie into the Heath.</p>

               </p>
               <p>There is a towne in <hi>Picardy</hi> ſituated vpon the riuer <hi>Oyſe,</hi> called <hi>Noyon,</hi> commended (if there were none other cauſe) for being the place of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuitie vnto that man of God <hi>Iohn Caluin</hi> of bleſſed memory, whoſe name is written in the booke of life, and ſhall yeeld a ſweete ſauour to the true Church of God to the worldes ende, whatſoeuer Sathan doth rage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the name of this ſeruant of God.</p>
               <p>This towne was ſeduced long before from the Kings obedience by the Leaguers, and through rebellion was poſſeſſed by the Kings enemies. The King therefore after the taking of <hi>Louiers,</hi> thought expedient to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooue his armie from <hi>Vernon,</hi> and to draw Eaſtward, that doing ſtill ſome profitable exployt, he might expect and receaue the forces that came to him out of <hi>Germany:</hi> and conſidering that the ſayd towne of <hi>Noyon</hi> did lye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene S. <hi>Quintin, Compeigne</hi> and <hi>Corbey,</hi> which were long before vnder his obedience, thought good there to ſtay for the approaching of the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes: and during the moneth of Iuly, hauing reduced the ſayd towne to great diſtreſſe, made his account ſhortly to be Lord of it.</p>
               <p>The Vicount <hi>Tauanes</hi> (head of the rebellion in the Citie of <hi>Roan,</hi> and moſt hatefulleſt enemie of any that the King had) enterpriſed to relieue the ſayd towne of <hi>Noyon,</hi> and for that intent in the beginning of Auguſt in the night ſeaſon departed from <hi>Roan,</hi> accompanied with foure hundred horſe, and fiue hundred footmen, with good hope either to ſuccour the ſaid towne, or els by ſurpriſe greatly to hinder the King.</p>
               <p>But the King hauing intelligences of his comming, met him about two or thrée leagues from <hi>Noyon,</hi> (as I haue heard reported) where his power was diſcomfited, ſlayne and taken priſoners, and he himſelfe after being wounded in the aſſault was alſo taken priſoner. So the Lord knoweth bow, where and when to ſtay his enemies.</p>
               <p>The newes of this ſorrowfull ſucceſſe of the Leaguers flying abroad,

               <p>In theſe ſo many charges geuen, there were a number of armed men ſlayne on the enemies ſide, and among them diuers of commandement. In the number of the dead were found <hi>Don Franciſco de Gueuara,</hi> the beſt Captayne of light Horſemen which the King of <hi>Spayne</hi> had in the low Countreys, alſo his lieutenant was ſlayne outright, with diuers other of great accompt.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Longchamp</hi> (one of the beſt Captains of the rebels) was taken priſoner, with more then foure ſcore men at armes of account, and loſt aboue fifteene hundred of their beſt horſes.</p>
               <p>The King loſt in this ſkirmiſh about twelue horſe of his light horſemen, and among a few which were ſlayne the Marſhall of the light horſemen, whoſe death was greatly bewayled, beeing accompted a man of great valour.</p>
               <p>The ſame day the Duke <hi>de Mayne</hi> arriued at the ſaid towne of <hi>Han,</hi> with all his troups of horſemen which he could gather, which thing made the King thinke that he would goe about either to raiſe or to interrupt the ſiege, or attempt ſome thing.</p>
               <p>In the meane time he loſt no opportunity about this ſiege: for the ſame day that this exploit was done, to wit, the ſeauenth of Auguſt, the Canon began to beat a church that ſtandeth in the middeſt of the Suburbes, which together with a great ditch did ſtrongly defend the ſame.</p>
               <p>The ſayd Church beeing battered from the morning to three a clock in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Auguſt"/> the after noone, had by that time made a great breach in the ſame.

               <p>
                  <pb n="544" facs="tcp:8966:279"/>
The ſayd Church beeing taken, and conſequently the Suburb (in a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as ſtrong as the towne) gaue occaſion both to them that had retired in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1591.

               <p>For the Gouernor (called the Lord <hi>Vile)</hi> conſidering how the Towne was ſlenderly furniſhed of all thinges, but ſpecially of men of armes, and that the moſt part of them had béene ſlayne in the aſſaults geuen to the Cittie, and how the King was ſtrong and not like to bee enforced to depart afore hee had the vpper hand ouer the ſayd Towne.

Alſo that the ſayd <hi>Ville,</hi> Gentlemen and Captains ſhall depart with armour, horſes and baggage, and the Souldiers with their weapons and horſe.

               <p>Item, that if any of the inhabitants be deſirous to depart, they ſhal ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly paſſe among the men of warre.</p>
               <p>Item, that the Lord <hi>Ville</hi> ſhall be permitted to ſend the Lord of <hi>Brouly</hi> to the Duke <hi>de Mayne,</hi> to aduertiſe him of the condition of this capitula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that the King ſhall ſafely conduct him to that effect.</p>
               <p>And for the accompliſhing of the premiſes, the ſayd Lord <hi>Ville</hi> hath promiſed to ſende hoſtages to the King, the Lord <hi>Rieulx,</hi> the Abbot of <hi>Genlis,</hi> with foure of the towne, ſuch as the King ſhall chooſe, whom the King doth promiſe to deliuer vppon the performance of the ſayd condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

               <p>Laſt of al, the Court doth declare Fryer <hi>Gregory</hi> his excommunication and Bulles, infamous libels full of impiety, hereſie, deceit and ſlanders, &amp; condemneth the ſame to betorne and burned publikly in the place of execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by the publike executioner of iuſtice, forbidding all men to receaue, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, reade, fauour or conceale the ſaid infamous libell, vppon payne to bee attainted, &amp; conuicted of high treaſon: &amp; commaundeth alſo all manner of perſons quickly to reueale to the court, if they ſhould know any ſuch to bee kept ſecretly on the paines aforeſaid.</p>

               <p>The ſelfe ſame proceedinges were vſed in all Courtes of the Realme, whereuppon enſued the burning of the ſayd Bulles in diuers and ſundry places of the Realme, but diuerſly, but euery where in as infamous ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as could bee.

receaue the right honorable Lord Earle of <hi>Eſſex</hi> (as is ſaid) in the towne of <hi>Giſors,</hi> and from thence returned into <hi>Champaigne,</hi> to ioyn with the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1591.

The ſaid Lord of <hi>Pierrefont</hi> being a deſperat Leaguer, had rather breake his faith with diſhonor, then to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill his promiſe with honour: whereupon the Marſhall <hi>Byron</hi> layed the ſiege before the ſaide Caſtell, and battered it with nine ſkore ſhot of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, wherewith hee made but a very ſmall hole: the ſtuffe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the ſaid Caſtell is builded, being of ſuch qualitie, as reſiſted the ſhot, euen to admiration, which cauſed the ſaid Marſhall <hi>Byron</hi> to breake off his enterpriſe, and march toward <hi>Normandie,</hi> who ioyned with the Engliſh forces, conducted by the right Honorable Lord, the Earle of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> the ninth of September, and the twenty one of the ſaid moneth, laide the ſiege before the towne of <hi>Gourney.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is ſaide before in the ſeauenth booke, how after the cruell death of King <hi>Henry</hi> the third, and laſt of the raſe of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>aloys,</hi> the authors of that murther, vnder the conduct of the Duke <hi>d'Mayne,</hi> with great bragges and confidence, went with a mighty army into <hi>Normandie,</hi> hoping to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the King, who with a ſmall power had retyred to <hi>Diepe,</hi> for the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes there alleaged.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid alſo, how the Duke <hi>d'Mayne</hi> in that iourney, tooke the ſaid towne of <hi>Gourney,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Rubempre</hi> which his companie therein. This Towne is diſtant from <hi>Roan</hi> ten Leagues, from <hi>Giſors</hi> fiue, from <hi>Beauuoys</hi> ſixe, and by eſtimation ſomewhat bigger then <hi>Diepe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Leaguers had fortified it with fortifications, munition of warre, and ſtrong garriſons, for Leagued Gentlemen of the Countrey, to the number of foure ſkore, and ſuch power as they thought good to entertaine, had ſettled themſelues therein, and from thence iſſuing dayly, made cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to the gates of <hi>Mante, Vernon, Pont de larche,</hi> and <hi>Giſors,</hi> ſpoyling and waſting all that was in their way, and taking priſoners ſuch as trauailed on the high way to <hi>Diepe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This towne being beſieged, the enemy put on a ſtout countenance at the firſt, and being ſummoned to ſurrender the ſaid towne, they anſwered that they had receaued it of the Duke <hi>d'Mayne,</hi> and for him they intended to kéepe it, neither would they render it, but to him onely.</p>
               <p>This anſwer being giuen, the Engliſh forces intrenched themſelues within a ſtones caſt of the gate, and in making and kéeping the ſaid Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, they had ſixe men hurt, and one killed. The enemies attempted di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers times to put men into the towne, but they were in ſuch ſort looked to
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:8966:281"/>
by the Engliſh men, that they durſt neuer approach.</p>
               <p>The 25. day of September at night, the Marſhall <hi>Byron</hi> planted nine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1591. Septemb."/> pieces of Ordinance before the towne, &amp; the 26. in the morning hee began to batter it, and a breach being made, the Engliſh men were called to the number of one hundred ſhot to giue the aſſault, who with great gladnes approached within ſixeſcore paſes of the wals, the breach was ſcarſe aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, the ditch was more then halfe full of water: it is reported that they had within certaine ſluces, which they might haue opened, and greatly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſted the aſſaulters, the French men were very vnable to giue the aſſault, becauſe of their long toyling and wearines, yet on a ſuddaine the enemies demaunded parley, which being graunted, they yeeldéd to foure diſhono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable conditions: ſuch is the fainting of rebels.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that all Souldiours ſhould depart without bagage and armour, with a white rod in their hands. But the Lord Earle of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> excepted the Queenes Maieſties ſubiects: therein was found none but one Iriſh man, who was executed.</p>
               <p>The ſecond was, that the Gouernour, Captaines, Lieutenants and Gentlemen of quality, ſhould remaine to his mercy. It was thought that the Gouernour and ſome Captaines ſhould be executed.</p>
               <p>The third was, that the Citizens ſhould haue their liues, but their goods reſted at the Kings pleaſure.</p>
               <p>The fourth is, that they ſhould receaue ſuch garriſons as ſhould bee thought good. The taking of this towne is a great eaſe to the Countrey, and preparation for the ſiege of <hi>Roan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About the 28. the army tooke his way toward <hi>Caudebeck,</hi> a ſmal towne, ſituated vpon a rock, on the banck of <hi>Seyne,</hi> betweene <hi>Roan</hi> and <hi>Newha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,</hi> entending to cleere all the coaſt round about <hi>Newhauen,</hi> of all filth of rebellion.</p>
