            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N hope of the fuller pardon of my delay, I now present you with two other Treatises be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the Sermon (enlarged) which at your desire I preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at your departure hence. I knew of many and great afflictions, which you had undergone in the removal of your dearest friends, which made this subject seem so suitable and seasonable to you at that time:
<pb facs="tcp:59347:4"/>
But I knew not that God was about to make so great an addition to your tryals in the same kind, by taking to himself <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Charles</hi> Earl of <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carres</hi> who dyed of a stone in his heart, of a very strange magnitude.</note> the principal branch of your Noble Family, (by a rare disease; the embleme of the mortal malady now raigning.) I hope this loss also shall promote your gain, by keeping you nearer to your Heavenly Lord, who is so jealous of your affections, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to have them entirely to himself: And then you will still find, that you <hi>are not alone,</hi> nor deprived of your dearest or most necessary friend, while the Father, the Son, the sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying and comforting Spirit is with you. And it should not be hard to reconcile us to the disposals of so sure a friend. Nothing but good can come from God; however the blind may miscall it, who know no Good or Evil, but what is measured by the private standard of their selfish interest, and that as judged of by sense. Eternal Love engaged by Covenant to make us happy, will do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what we shall find at last, will ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate in that blessed end. He envyed you not your Son, as too good for you, or too
<pb facs="tcp:59347:4"/>
great a mercy, who hath given you his own Son, and with him the mercy of eternal life. Corporal sufferings with Spiritual blessings, are the ordinary lot of Believers here on earth: As corporal prosperity with spiritual calamity is the lot of the ungodly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And I beseech you consider, that God knoweth better than you or I, what an Ocean your son was ready to lanch out into, and how tempestuous and terrible it might have proved, and whether the world that he is saved from, would have afforded him more of safety or seduction, of comfort or calamity? whether the protraction of the life of your Noble husband, to have seen our sins and their effects and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents, would have afforded him greater joy or sorrow? Undoubtedly as God had a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter title to your Husband, and Children, and Friends than you had, so it is much better to be with him, than to be with you, or with the best or greatest upon earth. The heavenly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants fear not our fears, and feel not our afflictions. They are past our dangers, and out of the reach of all our enemies, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from our pains and cares, and have the full possession of all those mercies which we
<pb facs="tcp:59347:5"/>
pray and labour for. Can you think your Children and Friends that are with Christ, are not safer and better than those that yet remain with you? Do you think that earth is better than heaven for you your self? I take it for granted you cannot think so, and will not say so; And if it be worse for you, its worse for them. The providence which by hastening their Glorification, doth promote your San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification; which helpeth them to the <hi>End,</hi> and helpeth you in the <hi>Way,</hi> must needs be good to them and you, however it appear to flesh and unbelief. O Madam, when our Lord hath shewed us (as he will shortly do) what a state it is to which he bringeth the spirits of the just, and how he doth there en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain and use them, we shall then be more competent judges of all those acts of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, to which we are now so hardly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled! Then we shall censure our censur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of these works of God, and be offended with our offences at them, and <hi>call our selves</hi> blind unthankful sinners, for <hi>calling them</hi> so bad as we did in our misjudging unbelief and passion. We shall not wish our selves or friends again on earth, among temptations
<pb facs="tcp:59347:5"/>
and pains, and among uncharitable men, malicious enemies, deceitful flatterers, and untrusty friends! When we see that face which we now long to see, and know the things which we long to know, and feel the Love which we long to feel, and are full of the joyes which now we can scarce attain a taste of, and have reacht the End which now we seek, and for which we suffer, we shall no more take it for a judgement to be taken from ungodly men, and from a world of sin, and fear, and sorrow; nor shall we envy the wicked, nor ever desire to be partakers of their pleasures. Till then, let us congratulate our departed friends the felicity which they have attained, and which we desire; and let us rejoyce with them that rejoyce with Christ, and let us prefer the least believing thought of the everlasting joyes, before all the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led transitory pleasures of the deluded, dreaming, miserable world. And let us pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer such converse as we can here attain, with God in Christ, and with the Heavenly So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, before all the pomp and friendship of the world. We have no friend that is so able to supply all our wants, so sufficient to
<pb facs="tcp:59347:6"/>
content us, so ready to relieve us, so willing to entertain us, so unwearied in hearing us, and conversing with us, as our blessed Lord. This is a friend that will never prove untrusty; nor be changed by any change of interest, opinion or fortune; nor give us cause to suspect his Love: A friend that we are sure will not forsake us, nor turn our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, nor abuse us for his own advantage, nor will ever dye or be separated from us, but we shall be alwaies with him, and see his Glory, and be filled and transported with his Love, and sing his praise to all Eternity. With whom then should we so delightfully converse on Earth? and till we can reach that sweet delightful converse, whom should we seek with more ambition, or observe with greater devotedness and respect? O that we were less carnal, and more spiritual, and lived less by Sense, and more by Faith; that we knew better the difference between God and Man, between visible Temporals, and invisible Eternals! we should then have other thoughts, and desires, and resolutions, and converse, and employments and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures than too many have!</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:59347:6"/>Madam, it displeaseth me that it is no more elaborate a Treatise, to which the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent opportunity inviteth me to prefix your Name; but your own Desire of the Third must be my excuse for all: But pardon the <hi>Manner,</hi> and I dare commend the <hi>Matter</hi> to you, as more worthy your serious contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and your daily most delightful practice, than any other that was ever proposed unto mortal man. This is the man-like noble life: The life which the Rational soul was made for: To which if our faculties be not by san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying Grace restored, they fall below their proper dignity and use, and are worse than lost; like a Prince or Learned man that is employed only in sweeping Dog-kennels, or tending Swine. <hi>To walk in Holiness with the most Holy God,</hi> is the improvement and advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the nature of man, towards its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed equality with Angels: When Earthli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Sensuality degrade humanity into (a voluntary, and therefore sinful) brutishness: This is the Life which affordeth the soul a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid and durable pleasure and content: When carnal minds evaporate into Air, and bubble into froth and vanity, wasted in a dream, and
<pb facs="tcp:59347:7"/>
the violent busie pursuit of a shadow; decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving themselves with a mixture of some coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit Religion; playing with God, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king for the world; living in jeast, and dying, and despairing, and suffering in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest; with unwearied labour building on the Sand, and sinking at death for want of a foundation; hating the serious practice of their own profest Religion, because it is not the profession, but the serious practice which hath the greatest enmity to their sensual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights; yet wishing to be numbred with those hereafter, whom they hated here: This <hi>Holy Walking with the most Holy God,</hi> is the only life which is best at last, and sweet in the review; which the Godly Live in, and most of the ungodly could wish to dye in; like him that wished to be <hi>Caesar</hi> in life, and <hi>Socrates</hi> at death: Yea this is the Life which hath no end; which we are <hi>here</hi> but <hi>learning,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to practise, and which we must here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after live (in another <hi>manner</hi> and <hi>degree</hi>) with God for ever: O wondrous Mercy! which thus ennobleth even the state of mortality! and honoureth <hi>Earth</hi> with so much participati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of, and communion with Heaven! That <hi>by
<pb facs="tcp:59347:7"/>
God,</hi> and <hi>with God,</hi> we may walk in holy peace and safety <hi>unto God,</hi> and there be blessed in his perfect <hi>Sight</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> for ever! Madam, the greatest service I can do you for all your favours, is, to pray that God will more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you with himself, and lead you by this blessed way to that more blessed end; that when you see all worldly glory in the dust, you may bless him for ever, who taught you to make a wiser choice: Which are the prayers of</p>

is my very business with thee to perswade thee, to live con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually upon these same <hi>Attributes</hi> and <hi>Relations</hi> of God, as upon thy daily air and bread; and to forsake that lean consuming company, who feed on the shels of hard and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren controversies, or on the froth of complements and affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed shews, and run after novelty instead of substantial solid nutriment: And to tell thee, that the primitive, pure, sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Christianity, consisted in the daily serious use of the <hi>great materials</hi> of the <hi>Creed; Lords Prayer,</hi> and <hi>ten Commandements,</hi> contracted in the words of our <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptismal Covenant.</hi> Do thus, and thou will be like those examples of the succeeding Church, in uprightness, purity, simplicity, charity, peaceableness and holy communion with God, when the pretended subtilties and sublimities of wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, uncharitable, contentious wits, will serve but to stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle or delude their souls. I have purposely been very brief on the several <hi>Attributes</hi> and <hi>Relations</hi> of God, in the first Treatise, because the copious handling of them would have made a very great volume of it self, and because it is my great design in that first part, to give you a sight of all Gods <hi>Attributes</hi> and <hi>Relations conjunct,</hi> and in their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that looking on them, not one by one, but all together in their proper places, the whole <hi>Image</hi> of God, may by them, be rightly imprinted on your minds; The <hi>Method</hi> being the <hi>first</hi> thing, and the necessary <hi>Impressions</hi> on the soul the second, which I there desire you to observe and employ your minds about, if you desire to profit, and receive what I intend you.</p>

                     <p>[THIS] That is, This which I am describing.</p>
                     <p>[LIFE] Life is taken sometime for the <hi>Souls abode in the Body,</hi> which is the <hi>Natural Life of man:</hi> or the <hi>souls</hi> continuation in its separated state, which is the <hi>Natural life of the soul:</hi> and sometimes for the <hi>Perfections</hi> of <hi>Natural life:</hi> And that either its <hi>Natural Perfection,</hi> that is, Its <hi>Health</hi> and <hi>Vivacity;</hi> or its <hi>moral perfection</hi> or <hi>Rectitude;</hi> and that is either in the <hi>Cause,</hi> and so <hi>God</hi> is our <hi>Life; Christ</hi> is our <hi>Life;</hi> the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> is our <hi>Life:</hi> or in <hi>it self:</hi> and so <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness</hi> is our <hi>Life</hi> in the <hi>Principle, Seed</hi> or <hi>Habit.</hi> Sometime <hi>Life</hi> is taken for the <hi>Work, Imployment</hi> and <hi>Exercise</hi> of <hi>Life;</hi> and so a <hi>Holy Conversation,</hi> is our <hi>Moral, Spiritual,</hi> or <hi>holy life.</hi> And sometime it is taken for the <hi>Felicity</hi> of the living: And so it containeth all the former in their highest perfection, that is, both <hi>Natural Life,</hi> and <hi>Moral-Spiritual Life,</hi> and the <hi>holy exercise thereof,</hi> together with the full attainment and fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition of God in Glory, the End of all.</p>
                     <p>[ETERNAL] That is, <hi>simply eternal, objectively,</hi> as to God the principal object: and Eternal <hi>ex parte post, subjective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;</hi> that is, <hi>Everlasting.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>[THIS IS LIFE ETERNAL] Not <hi>Natural life</hi>

in it self considered, as the Devils and wicked men shall have it. But 1. It is the same <hi>Moral-Spiritual Life</hi> which shall have no <hi>End,</hi> but endure to Eternity: It is a Living to God in Love; But only <hi>initial,</hi> and very <hi>imperfect</hi> here, in comparison of what it will be in Heaven. 2. It is the <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal felicity,</hi> 1. <hi>Seminally;</hi> for Grace is as it were a seed of Glory; 2.

                     <p>In the <hi>Being</hi> of the Creation and every particular Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, his <hi>Infinite Being</hi> is revealed; so wretched a <hi>Fool</hi> is the <hi>Atheist,</hi> that by denying <hi>God,</hi> he denyeth <hi>all things!</hi> Could he prove that there is <hi>no God,</hi> I would quickly prove that there is <hi>no world,</hi> no man, no creature: If he know that <hi>he is</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, or that the <hi>world</hi> or any Creature is, he may know that <hi>God is:</hi> For <hi>God</hi> is the <hi>Original Being;</hi> And all <hi>Being</hi> that is not <hi>Eternal,</hi> must have some <hi>Original:</hi> And that which hath no <hi>Original</hi> is <hi>God,</hi> being Eternal, Infinite, and without cause.</p>

                        </hi> of his <hi>Love,</hi> as giving us the greatest mercies, by the most preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous means, in the meetest season and manner for our good; Reconciling us to himself, and treating us as Children, with Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly compassions, and bringing us nearer him, and opening to us the everlasting treasure, having brought life and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality to light in the Gospel.</p>
                     <p>God being thus revealed to man from without, in the three <hi>Glasses</hi> or <hi>Seals</hi> of the <hi>Creation, Law,</hi> and <hi>Son</hi> himself, he is also revealed to us in <hi>our selves, man</hi> being, as it were, a little world.</p>
                     <p>In the Nature of <hi>man</hi> is revealed as in a <hi>Seal</hi> or <hi>Glass</hi> the nature of the <hi>blessed God</hi> in some measure. In <hi>Unity</hi> of <hi>Essence,</hi> we have a <hi>Trinity of Faculties of soul,</hi> even the <hi>Vegetative, Sensitive</hi> and <hi>Rational,</hi> as our bodies have both parts and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, <hi>Natural, Vital,</hi> and <hi>Animal;</hi> the <hi>Rational Power</hi> in Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, hath also <hi>its Trinity</hi> of <hi>faculties,</hi> even <hi>Power</hi> for <hi>Execution, Understanding</hi> for <hi>Direction,</hi> and <hi>Will</hi> for <hi>Command:</hi> The measure of <hi>Power</hi> is <hi>Naturally</hi> sufficient to its use and end; the understanding is a faculty to <hi>reason, discern,</hi> and <hi>discourse;</hi> The will hath that <hi>Freedom</hi> which beseemeth an undetermined, self-determining creature here in the way.</p>
                     <p>Besides this <hi>Physical Image</hi> of God that is inseparable from our <hi>Nature,</hi> we have also his <hi>Law written in our hearts,</hi> and are <hi>our selves objectively part</hi> of the <hi>Law of nature,</hi> that is, the <hi>signifiers of the will of God.</hi> Had we not by sin obliterated

somewhat of <hi>this Image,</hi> it would have shewed it self more clearly, and we should have been more capable of understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.</p>
                     <p>And then when we are <hi>Regenerate and Renewed by the Grace</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> of Christ, and planted into him, as living members of his body, we have then the <hi>third impression</hi> upon our souls, and are made like our Head in <hi>Wisdom, Holiness</hi> and in <hi>effectual strength.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Considered as we were at first possessed with the <hi>light</hi> and <hi>law</hi> of works or <hi>Nature,</hi> (of which we yet retain some part) so we have the Impress of <hi>all</hi> these Attributes of God; But most <hi>Eminently</hi> of his <hi>Wisdom.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Man</hi> being thus made at first the <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Sapiential image of God,</hi> (with <hi>much</hi> of the <hi>Image</hi> of his <hi>Love</hi>) the <hi>Lord</hi> did presently by <hi>necessary Resultancy</hi> and <hi>voluntary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,</hi> stand <hi>Related</hi> to us in such <hi>variety</hi> of <hi>Relations,</hi> as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer the foresaid <hi>Properties</hi> and <hi>Attributes.</hi> And these <hi>Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of God to us, are next to be known, as flowing from his <hi>Attributes</hi> and <hi>Works.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As we have our <hi>derived Being</hi> from God who is the <hi>Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Eternal Being;</hi> so from our <hi>Being</hi> given by <hi>Creation,</hi> God is <hi>Related</hi> to us as our <hi>Maker;</hi> From this Relation of a <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> in Unity, there ariseth a Trinity of Relations: This <hi>Trintty</hi> is in that <hi>Unity,</hi> and that <hi>Unity</hi> in this <hi>Trinty.</hi> First God having <hi>made us of nothing,</hi> is necessarily <hi>Related</hi> to us as <hi>our Lord;</hi> By a <hi>Lord</hi> we mean strictly, a <hi>Proprietary</hi> or <hi>Owner,</hi> as you are the <hi>Owner</hi> of your goods or any thing that is your <hi>Own.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, He is <hi>Related</hi> to us as <hi>our Ruler,</hi> our <hi>Governour</hi> or <hi>King.</hi> This riseth from our <hi>nature, made to be Ruled in order to our End<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

to the Government of the world, and only is <hi>fit</hi> and <hi>capable</hi> of Ruling it.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, He is <hi>Related</hi> also to us as <hi>our Benefactor</hi> or <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> freely and of his bounty giving us all the good that we do receive.</p>
                     <p>His <hi>first Relation</hi> in this <hi>Trinity,</hi> answereth his first <hi>Property in</hi> the <hi>Trinity:</hi> He is our <hi>Almighty Creator,</hi> and therefore is our <hi>Owner</hi> or our <hi>Lord.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>second</hi> of these <hi>Relations</hi> answereth the <hi>second Property</hi> of God. He is <hi>most Wise,</hi> and made an <hi>Impress</hi> of <hi>his Wisdom</hi> on the <hi>Rational</hi> Creature, and therefore is our <hi>Governour.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The third <hi>Relation</hi> answereth the <hi>third property</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> As he is <hi>most Good,</hi> so he is our <hi>Benefactor;</hi> Psal. 119. 68. <hi>Thou art Good, and dost Good.</hi> Mans nature and disposition is known by his Works, though he be a <hi>free agent;</hi> For <hi>the Tree is known by its fruit,</hi> Mat. 7. 17. And so <hi>Gods nature</hi> is known by his works (as far as is fit for us here to know) though he be a <hi>free agent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In each of these <hi>Relations,</hi> God hath <hi>other special Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes,</hi> which are denominated from his <hi>Relations,</hi> or his <hi>fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing works.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As he is <hi>our Lord</hi> or <hi>Owner,</hi> his proper Attribute is to be <hi>Absolute,</hi> having so full a title to us, that he may do with us what he list, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. 15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 21.</p>
                     <p>As he is our <hi>Ruler,</hi> his proper Attribute is to be our <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign</hi> or <hi>Supream;</hi> there being none above him, nor co-ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate with him, nor any Power of Government but what is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from him.</p>
                     <p>As he is our Benefactor, it is his prerogative to be our <hi>Chief,</hi> or <hi>All:</hi> the Alpha and Omega; the Fountain or first <hi>Effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent</hi> cause of all that we receive or hope for; and the <hi>End</hi> or ultimate final cause that can make us Happy by fruition, and that we must still intend.</p>
                     <p>As these are the Attributes of God in these his <hi>great Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> so in Respect to the <hi>Works</hi> of these Relations, he hath other <hi>subordinate</hi> Attributes. As he is our <hi>Owner,</hi> it is his <hi>Work</hi> to <hi>Dispose</hi> of us; and his proper Attribute to be most <hi>Free.</hi> As he is our <hi>Ruler,</hi> it is his <hi>work</hi> to <hi>Govern us;</hi> which is first, by <hi>making Laws</hi> for us, and then by <hi>teaching</hi> and <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading</hi>
                        <pb n="13" facs="tcp:59347:17"/>
us to keep them, and lastly by <hi>executing</hi> them; which is by <hi>Judging, Rewarding,</hi> and <hi>Punishing.</hi> In respect to all these, his principal Attribute is, to be <hi>Just</hi> or <hi>Righteous;</hi> In which is comprehended his <hi>Truth</hi> or <hi>Faithfulness,</hi> his <hi>Holiness,</hi> his <hi>Mercy,</hi> and his <hi>terrible dreadfulness.</hi> As his Attributes appear in the Assertions of his word, he is <hi>True</hi> (his <hi>Veracity</hi> being nothing but his <hi>Power, Wisdom,</hi> and <hi>Goodness,</hi> expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing themselves in his <hi>Word</hi> or Revelations.) For he that is <hi>Able</hi> to do what he will, and so wise as to <hi>Know</hi> all things, and so <hi>Good</hi> as to <hi>Will</hi> nothing but what is <hi>Good,</hi> cannot possibly lye; For every lie is either for want of <hi>Power, or Knowledge,</hi> or <hi>Goodness;</hi> He that is most <hi>Able</hi> and <hi>Knowing, need</hi> not deceive by Lying; And he that is most <hi>Good, will</hi> not do it without need. As his first properties appear in the word of Promise, he is called <hi>Faithful,</hi> which is his <hi>Truth</hi> in making good a word of grace. As he <hi>Commandeth</hi> Holy duties, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth sin as the most detestable thing, by a pure, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Law, so he is called <hi>Holy;</hi> and also as the <hi>fountain</hi> of this Law, and the Grace that sanctifieth his people. As he <hi>fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth</hi> his <hi>promises,</hi> and rewardeth, and defendeth men accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his word, so he is called <hi>Merciful</hi> and <hi>Gracious</hi> as a <hi>Governour,</hi> (where his Mercy is considered as limited or or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate by his laws.) As he <hi>fulfilleth</hi> his <hi>Threatnings,</hi> he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>Angry, wrathful, terrible, dreadful, holy, jealous,</hi> &amp;c. But he is <hi>Just</hi> in all.</p>
                     <p>And as these are his Attributes as our <hi>Soveraign Ruler;</hi> so as our <hi>Benefactor,</hi> his special Attribute is to be <hi>Gracious,</hi> or <hi>Bountiful</hi> or <hi>Benign;</hi> or to be Loving, and inclined to do good. These are the Attributes of God resulting from his Nature as appearing in his Image in the <hi>Creation, Laws,</hi> and the <hi>person of his Son;</hi> and resulting from his <hi>Relations</hi> and the <hi>works</hi> of those Relations; even as he is our <hi>Creator,</hi> in <hi>Unity;</hi> and our <hi>Lord</hi> or <hi>Owner,</hi> our <hi>Ruler,</hi> and <hi>Benefactor,</hi> in <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Were it not my purpose to consine my self to this short dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the nature, attributes, and works of God, but to run deeper into the rest of the body of Divinity, I should come down to the fall, and work of Redemption, and shew you in the <hi>Gospel</hi> and all the <hi>ordinances,</hi> &amp;c. the footsteps of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59347:18"/>
this Method of <hi>Trinity</hi> in <hi>Unity,</hi> which I have here begun; but that were to digress.</p>
                     <p>Besides what is said, we might name you many Attributes of God that are commonly called <hi>Negative,</hi> and do but distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish him from the Imperfect Creature, by setting him above us Infinitely in his perfections. <hi>Man</hi> hath a <hi>Body;</hi> but <hi>God</hi> is not a <hi>Body,</hi> but a <hi>spirit; Man</hi> is <hi>mutable,</hi> but God <hi>Immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;</hi> Man is <hi>Mortal,</hi> but God <hi>Immortal,</hi> &amp;c. And now as I have shewed you these Properties, Relations, and Attributes of God, so I must next tell you that <hi>we</hi> also stand in answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>counter-relations</hi> unto <hi>him;</hi> and must <hi>have</hi> the <hi>qualities,</hi> and <hi>do</hi> the <hi>works</hi> that answer those Relations.</p>
                     <p>1. As God is our <hi>Almighty Creator,</hi> so we are his <hi>Creatures,</hi> impotent and insufficient for our selves. We owe him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all that a Creature can owe his Maker, that hath but our receivings. 2. In this Relation is contained a <hi>Trinity</hi> of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations. 1. We are his <hi>Own,</hi> as he is our <hi>Lord.</hi> 2. We are his <hi>subjects</hi> as he is <hi>our Ruler.</hi> 3. We are his <hi>Children</hi> as he is <hi>our Father;</hi> or his obliged <hi>Beneficiaries</hi> as he is our <hi>Benefactor.</hi> And now having opened to your observation the <hi>Image</hi> of God, and the extrinsick seals, I have ripened the discourse so far, that I may fitlyer shew you, How the <hi>Impression</hi> of this <hi>Image</hi> of God is to be made upon the soul of the Believer.</p>

                     <p>1. <hi>HE that cometh to God, must believe that God is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him,</hi> Heb. 11. 6. The first thing to be imprinted on the soul is, <hi>that there is a God:</hi> that he is a <hi>real most Trascendent Being.</hi> As sure as the <hi>Sun</hi> that shineth hath a <hi>Being,</hi> and the <hi>Earth</hi> that beareth us hath a <hi>being,</hi> so sure hath <hi>God</hi> that made them a <hi>Being</hi> infinitely more excellent then theirs. As sure as the streams come from the fountain, and as sure as Earth and Stones, and Beasts, and Men did never make themselves, nor do uphold themselves, or continue the course of nature in themselves and others, nor govern the world, so sure is there
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59347:18"/>
an Infinite eternal Being that doth this. Every Atheist that is not mad must confess that <hi>there is an Eternal Being,</hi> that had <hi>no beginning</hi> or <hi>cause;</hi> The question is only, <hi>which this is</hi> 
                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which ever it is, it is this that is <hi>the true God.</hi> What now would the Atheist have it to be? Certainly it is that <hi>Being</hi> that hath <hi>being</hi> it self from none that is the first cause of all other <hi>Beings:</hi> And if it <hi>caused</hi> them, it must necessarily be every way <hi>more excellent</hi> then <hi>they,</hi> and contain all the good that it hath <hi>caused;</hi> For none can <hi>give</hi> that which it <hi>hath not</hi> to give; nor <hi>make</hi> that which is <hi>better</hi> then it self; that <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> that hath made so glorious a creature as the <hi>Sun,</hi> must needs it self be much <hi>more glorious.</hi> It could not have put <hi>strength</hi> and <hi>power</hi> into the Creatures, if it had not it self <hi>more strength</hi> and <hi>power.</hi> It could not have put <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> into the Creature, if it had not <hi>more Wisdom and Goodness</hi> then all they. Whatever it is therefore that hath <hi>more Power, Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Goodness</hi> then all the world besides, that is it which <hi>we</hi> call <hi>God. That cause</hi> that hath communicated to all things else, the <hi>Being, Power,</hi> and <hi>all perfections</hi> which they have, is the <hi>God</hi> whom we acknowledge and adore; If Democritists will ascribe all this to <hi>Atomes,</hi> and think that the Motes did make the Sun; or if others will think that the <hi>Sun</hi> is God because it participateth of so much of his <hi>excellency,</hi> let them be mad a while till judgement shall convince them. So clear beyond all question to <hi>my soul</hi> is the <hi>Being</hi> of the Godhead, that the Devil hath much lost the rest of his more subtil tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations, when he hath foolishly and maliciously adjoyned this, to draw me to question the <hi>Being of my God;</hi> which is more then to question Whether there be a Sun in the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>But what is the <hi>Impress</hi> that the <hi>Being</hi> of God must make upon the Soul?</p>
                     <p>I answer From hence the holy soul discerneth that the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning</hi> and the <hi>End</hi> of his Religion, the <hi>substance</hi> of his Hope is the <hi>Being</hi> of <hi>Beings,</hi> and not a shaddow; and that his faith is not a fansie. The <hi>Object</hi> is as it were the <hi>matter</hi> of the act. If our faith and hope and Love and Fear be exercised about the most <hi>Real Being,</hi> it shews that there is a Reality in our <hi>faith,</hi> and that we be not exercised in a delusory work;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59347:19"/>
God is to the Atheist but an empty name; He feels no <hi>life</hi> or <hi>Being</hi> in him; And accordingly he offereth him a <hi>shaddow</hi> of <hi>devotion,</hi> and a <hi>nominal service.</hi> But to the holy soul there is nothing that hath <hi>life</hi> and <hi>Being</hi> but God, and that which doth receive a <hi>Being</hi> from him, and leadeth to him. This <hi>Real</hi> object putteth a <hi>Reality</hi> into all the devotions of a holy soul. They look upon the vanities of the world as <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;</hi> and therefore they look on worldly men as on idle dreamers that are <hi>doing nothing.</hi> This puts a <hi>seriousness</hi> and <hi>Life</hi> into the faith and holy affections of the believer. He <hi>knows whom he trusteth,</hi> 2 Tim. 1. 12. he <hi>knows</hi> whom he <hi>Loveth,</hi> and in whom he <hi>Hopeth.</hi> Atheists and all ungodly men, do <hi>practically</hi> judge of <hi>God,</hi> as the true Believer judgeth of the <hi>world.</hi> The Atheist takes the pleasures of the world to be the only <hi>substance;</hi> and God to be but as a shaddow, a notion, or a dream. The godly take the world to be <hi>as nothing,</hi> and <hi>know</hi> it is but a fancy and dream, and shadow of pleasures, and honour, and profit, and felicity, that men talk of and seek so eargerly below; but that God is the substantial object and portion of the soul. If you put into the mouth of a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry man, a little froth, or breath, or aire, and bid him eat it, and feed upon it, he will tell you, he finds no <hi>substance</hi> in it; so judgeth the graceless soul of God, and so judgeth the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious soul of the creature as separate from God.</p>
                     <p>Let this be the <hi>Impression</hi> on thy soul, from the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Gods transcendent Being!</hi> O look upon thy self and all things as <hi>nothing without him!</hi> and as <hi>Nothing</hi> in <hi>comparison of him!</hi> And therefore let thy <hi>Love</hi> to them be <hi>as nothing,</hi> and thy <hi>desires</hi> after them and care for them <hi>as nothing!</hi> But let the <hi>Being</hi> of thy <hi>Love, desire,</hi> and <hi>endeavours,</hi> be let out upon the <hi>transcendent Being.</hi> The creature hath its <hi>kind</hi> of <hi>being;</hi> but if it would be to us instead of <hi>God,</hi> it will be <hi>as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi> The <hi>Aire</hi> hath its <hi>Being,</hi> but we cannot <hi>dwell</hi> in it, nor <hi>rest</hi> upon it to support us as the <hi>earth</hi> doth. The <hi>water</hi> hath its <hi>Being,</hi> but it will not <hi>bear</hi> us, if we would walk upon it. The name of the great Jehovah is [<hi>I am</hi>] Exod. 3. 14. Try any Creature in thy need, and it will say, as <hi>Jacob</hi> to <hi>Rachel,</hi> Gen. 30. 2. <hi>Am I in Gods stead that hath withheld thy desire from thee?</hi> send to it, and it will say as <hi>John Baptist<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

that <hi>confessed [I am not the Christ</hi>] Joh. 1. 20. Let none of all the affections of thy soul, have so much <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Being</hi> in them, as those that are exercised upon God. <hi>Worms</hi> and <hi>motes</hi> are not regarded in comparison of <hi>mountains:</hi> a <hi>drop</hi> is not regarded in comparison of the <hi>Ocean.</hi> Let the <hi>Being</hi> of God take up thy soul and draw off thy observation from deluding vanities, as if there were no such things before thee. When thou remembrest that <hi>there is a God,</hi> Kings and Nobles, Riches and Honours, and all the world should be forgotten in comparison of him; And thou shouldst live as if there <hi>were no such things,</hi> if <hi>God</hi> appear not to thee in them.

the <hi>Creature;</hi> For the <hi>Creatures</hi> are <hi>Many</hi> and of <hi>contrary qualities,</hi> dispositions, and affections; And the heart that is set on such an object, must needs be a <hi>Divided heart;</hi> And the heart that is <hi>Divided</hi> among <hi>so many</hi> and <hi>contrary</hi> or discordant objects, must needs he a <hi>distracted heart.</hi> The confusions of the world confound the heart that is set upon the world. He that maketh the world his God, hath <hi>so many</hi> Gods, and so discordant, that he will never please them all, and all of them together will never fully content and please <hi>him.</hi> And who would have a God that can neither please us, nor be pleased? He that maketh <hi>Himself</hi> his God, hath a <hi>compounded</hi> God (and now <hi>corrupted</hi>) of <hi>multifarious,</hi> and now of <hi>contrary</hi> desires, as hard to please as any <hi>without</hi> us. There is no <hi>Rest</hi> or <hi>Happiness</hi> but in <hi>Unity.</hi> And therefore none in <hi>our selves</hi> or any other creature; but in <hi>God</hi> the only center of the soul. The further from the <hi>Center,</hi> the further from <hi>Unity.</hi> It is only <hi>in God</hi> that differing minds can be <hi>well united.</hi> Therefore is the world so <hi>divided,</hi> because it is departed so far from <hi>God.</hi> Therefore have we so many minds and wayes, and such diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of opinions, and contrariety of affections, because men forsake the <hi>Center</hi> of <hi>Unity.</hi> There's no Uniting in any worldly, carnal, self-devised principles, or practises. When <hi>Holiness</hi> brings these distracted, scatterd souls to <hi>God,</hi> in him they will be <hi>one.</hi> While they bark at <hi>Holiness,</hi> and cry up <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> they shew themselves distracted men. For <hi>Holiness</hi> is the only way to <hi>Unity,</hi> because it is the closure of the soul with <hi>God.</hi> All countreys, and persons cannot meet in any one interest or <hi>Creature,</hi> but each hath a several interest of his own; But they might all meet <hi>in God.</hi> If the <hi>Pope</hi> were <hi>God</hi> and had <hi>his perfections,</hi> he would be <hi>fit</hi> for all the Church to Center in; But being <hi>man,</hi> and yet pretending to this <hi>Prerogative of God,</hi> he is the <hi>grand divider</hi> and <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracter</hi> of the Church. The Proverb is too true; [<hi>So many men, so many minds</hi>] because that every man will be <hi>a God</hi> to himself, having a <hi>self mind,</hi> and <hi>self will,</hi> and all men will not yield to be <hi>one in God.

As the <hi>antient Baptism,</hi> contained no more but our <hi>Engagement to God, the Father, Son and Holy Ghost,</hi> so the <hi>antient Profession</hi> of saving faith, was of the same extent. <hi>God</hi> is sufficient for the Church to <hi>Unite</hi> in.

                     <p>The <hi>Unity</hi> of <hi>God</hi> is the Attribute to be first handled and imprinted on the mind, even next unto his <hi>Essence; Deut.</hi> 6. 4. <hi>The Lord our God is one Lord.</hi> And the <hi>unity</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> is its excellency and attribute, that's <hi>first</hi> and <hi>most</hi> to be esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and preserved next unto its <hi>Essence.</hi> If it be not <hi>a Church,</hi> it cannot be <hi>One Church;</hi> and if <hi>we</hi> be not <hi>Saints,</hi> we cannot be <hi>united Saints.</hi> If we be not <hi>Members,</hi> we cannot make <hi>One Body.</hi> But when once we have the <hi>Essence</hi> of <hi>Saints</hi> and of <hi>a Church,</hi> we must next be solicitous for its <hi>Unity;</hi> Nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low an <hi>essential point of faith</hi> will allow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Lord. But the <hi>next</hi> point of Necessity is it that the Church be <hi>One,</hi> and Christians be <hi>One.</hi> And he that for the sake of <hi>lower</hi> points, how <hi>True</hi> soever, will break this holy bond of <hi>Unity</hi> shall find at last to his shame and sorrow, that he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood not the <hi>excellency</hi> or <hi>necessity</hi> of <hi>unity.</hi> The prayer of Christ for the perfection of his Saints is, [<hi>that they all may be One, as thou Father art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us; that the world may believe that thou hast sent me: And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them, that they may be One, even as we are One: I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in One, that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them as thou hast lved me</hi>] Here it appeareth that the <hi>Unity</hi> of the Church or Saints is necessary, to convince the world of the truth of Christianity, and of the Love of God to his people, and necessary to the glory and perfection of the Saints. The nearer any Churches, or members are to the <hi>divine perfections,</hi> and the more strictly conformable to the mind of God, the more they are <hi>One,</hi> and replenished with <hi>Catholick Love to all Saints,</hi> and desirous of <hi>Unity</hi> and <hi>Communion</hi> with them. It is a most lamentable delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of some Christians that think their ascending to higher de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Holiness, doth partly consist in their <hi>withdrawing</hi> from the <hi>Catholike Church,</hi> or from the <hi>Communion</hi> of <hi>most of the Saints on Earth,</hi> upon the account of some smaller differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing opinions; And they think that they should become more loose, and leave their strictness, if they should hold <hi>a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Communion,</hi> and leave their <hi>state of separation,</hi> and <hi>divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion!</hi> Is there <hi>any strictness</hi> amiable or desirable, except a <hi>strict Conformity to God?</hi> Surely a strict way of sin and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness is not desirable to a Saint.

                     <p>2. And let it make thee long for the <hi>Unity of the Saints,</hi> and endeavour it to the utmost of thy power, that the Church in Unity may be more like the Head.</p>
                     <p>3. And let it cause thee to admire the Happiness of the Saints, that are freeed from the bondage of the distracting Creature, and have but <hi>One</hi> to Love, and Fear, and Trust, and Serve, and Seek, and Know; <hi>One thing is needful,</hi> which should be chosen, but its <hi>many</hi> that we are troubled about, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11. 42.</p>

                     <p>3. THe <hi>Immensity</hi> of God (which is the next Attribute to be considered) must have this Effect upon thy soul: 1. The <hi>Infinite</hi> God that is <hi>everywhere</hi> comprehending all places and things, and comprehended by none, must raise <hi>admiring reverent</hi> thoughts in the soul of the believer
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:59347:22"/>
We <hi>wonder</hi> at the <hi>Magnitude</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi> and the <hi>Heavens,</hi> and of the <hi>whole Creation;</hi> But when we begin to think what is <hi>beyond</hi> the Heavens, and all created Being, we are at a kind of loss. Why it <hi>is God</hi> that is <hi>in</hi> all, and <hi>above</hi> all, and <hi>beyond</hi> all, and <hi>beneath</hi> all: and where there is <hi>no place</hi> because <hi>no Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> there is <hi>God;</hi> And if thy thoughts should imagine mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of millions of miles beyond all place and measure, all is <hi>but God,</hi> and go as far as thou canst in thy thoughts and thou canst not go <hi>beyond him.</hi> Reverently admire the <hi>Immensity</hi> of God. The world and all the Creatures in it, are not to God so much as a <hi>sand</hi> or <hi>atome</hi> is to all the <hi>world.</hi> The point of a needle is more to all the world, then the world to God. For between that which is <hi>Finite,</hi> and that which is <hi>Infinite,</hi> there is no comparison. Isa. 40. 12, 15, 17. <hi>Who hath mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured the waters in the hollow of his hand? and meated out Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with the span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales and the hills in a ballance?—Behold the Nations are as a drop of a bucket, and are counted as the small dust of the ballance<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>2. From this Greatness and Immensity of God also thy soul must reverently stay all its busie, bold enquiries, and know that God is to us and to every creature <hi>Imcomprehensible.</hi> If thou couldst fathome or measure him, and know his <hi>Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> by a <hi>comprehensive knowledge,</hi> he were not <hi>God.</hi> A <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> can <hi>comprehend</hi> nothing but a <hi>Creature.</hi> You may <hi>know</hi> God, but not <hi>comprehend</hi> him; As your foot <hi>treadeth</hi> on the earth, but doth not <hi>cover all</hi> the earth. The Sea is not the Sea, if you can hold it in a spoon. Thou canst not <hi>comprehend</hi> the <hi>Sun</hi> which thou <hi>seest,</hi> and by which thou seest all things else, nor the sea, or earth, no nor a worm or pile of grass: Thy understanding knoweth not <hi>all</hi> that God hath put into any the least of these; Thou art a stranger to thy <hi>self,</hi> and to somewhat in every part of thy self, both body and soul. And thinkest thou to <hi>comprehend God,</hi> that perfectly comprehendest <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing?</hi> Stop then thy overbold enquiries, and remember that thou art a shallow finite worm, and God is <hi>Infinite.</hi> First,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:59347:22"/>
reach to comprehend the <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi> and whole <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> before thou think of Comprehending him, to whom the world is nothing, or vanity, or so small a dust, or drop, or point. [Job. 37. 1, 5. saith <hi>Elihu, At this my heart trembleth, and is moved out of his place: Hear attentively the Noise of his Voice,—God thundereth marvelously with his Voice; great things doth he which we cannot comprehend</hi>] How then should we <hi>comprehend himself?</hi> When God pleadeth his cause with <hi>Job</hi> himself, what doth he but convince him of his <hi>Infiniteness</hi> and <hi>absoluteness,</hi> even from the greatness of his works, which are beyond our reach and yet are as <hi>nothing</hi> to <hi>himself!</hi> Should he take the busie enquirer in hand, but as he did begin with <hi>Job,</hi> 38. 1, 2. &amp;c. [<hi>Who is this that darkeneth Counsel by words without knowledge? Gird up thy loins like a man, for I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of thee, and answer thou me,</hi> &amp;c.] alas, how soon would he non-plus and confound us? and make us say as <hi>Job.</hi> 40. 4. [<hi>Behold I am vile! what shall I answer thee? I will lay my hand upon my mouth: Once have I spoken, but I will not answer; yea twice, but I will proceed no further.</hi>] Indeed there is mentioned Eph. 3. 11. <hi>The Saints comprehending</hi> the dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of <hi>the Love of Christ,</hi> but as the next verse saith, <hi>it pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth knowledge;</hi> so <hi>comprehending</hi> there signifieth no more, but a <hi>knowing according to our Measure;</hi> an attainment of what we are capable to attain; nay nor all that neither, but such a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent knowledge of the Love of Christ as is common to all the Saints; As there is nothing <hi>more visible</hi> then the <hi>Sun,</hi> and yet <hi>no visible</hi> being <hi>less comprehended</hi> by the sight; so is there nothing <hi>more Intelligible</hi> then God (for he is All in all things) and yet nothing so <hi>Incomprehensible</hi> to the mind that knoweth him. It satisfieth me not to be <hi>Ignorant</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> nor to know so <hi>little</hi> as I know, nor to be short of the measure that I am capable of; but it satisfieth me to be <hi>uncapable</hi> of <hi>compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending him;</hi> or else I must be unsatisfied because I am not God. O the presumptuous arrogancy of those men, if I may call them men, that dare prate about the Infinite God such things as never were revealed to them, in his works or word? and dare pretend to measure him by their shallow understandings, and question, if not deny and censure, that of God which they cannot reach! and sooner
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59347:23"/>
suspect the word that doth reveal him, then their muddy brains that should better conceive of him! Saith <hi>Elihu</hi> Job 36. 26. [<hi>Behold God is Great, and we know him not, neither can the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his years be searched out.</hi>] Though the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of him be our <hi>Life Eternal,</hi> yet we <hi>know him not</hi> by any <hi>full</hi> and <hi>ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate</hi> conception. We know an <hi>Infinite God,</hi> and therefore with an <hi>Excellent Knowledge objectively</hi> considered; but with a <hi>poor degree</hi> and <hi>kind</hi> of Knowledge next to none, as to the <hi>act;</hi> and it is a thousand thousand fold more that we <hi>know not</hi> of him, then that <hi>we know:</hi> For ineeed there is no compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to be here made.</p>
                     <p>3. The immensity of God as it proveth him incomprehensible, so it containeth his <hi>Omnipresence;</hi> And therefore should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually affect us as men that believe that God stands by them. As we would compose our thoughts, and minds and passions, if we <hi>saw</hi> (were it possible) the Lord stand over us, so should we <hi>now</hi> labour to compose them. As we would <hi>restrain</hi> and <hi>use</hi> our tongues, and order our behaviour if we <hi>saw</hi> his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, so should we do <hi>now</hi> when we <hi>know</hi> that he is with us. An <hi>eye servant</hi> will work hard in his <hi>masters presence,</hi> what ever he doth behind his back. Bestir thee then Christian, for <hi>God stands by; In him we live and move and have our Being,</hi> Act. 17. 28. Loyter not till thou canst truly say that God is gone or absent from thee; sin not by wilfulness or negligence till thou canst say, thou art behind his back. Alass that we should have no more awakened serious souls and no more fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent lively prayers, and no more serious holy speech, and no more careful heavenly lives, when we <hi>stand before</hi> the living God, and do all in his sight, and speak all in his hearing? O why should <hi>sense</hi> so much affect us, and <hi>faith,</hi> and <hi>Knowledge</hi> work no more? we can be awed with the presence of a <hi>man,</hi> and would not do before a <hi>Prince,</hi> what most men do before the <hi>Lord.</hi> Yea <hi>other</hi> things affect us when we <hi>see them not;</hi> and shall not God? But of this more anon.</p>
                     <p>4. The <hi>Immensity</hi> of God assureth us much of his <hi>Alsuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency.</hi> He that <hi>is everywhere,</hi> is easily able to <hi>hear all prayers,</hi> to <hi>help</hi> us in <hi>all straits,</hi> to <hi>supply all wants,</hi> to <hi>punish</hi> all sins. A Blasphemous conceit of God as <hi>Finite<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> and as absent from us, is one of the causes of our distrust. He that doth distrust
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59347:23"/>
an absent friend, as thinking he may forget him, or neglect him, will trust him when he is <hi>with him;</hi> cannot he hear thee, and pitty thee and help thee that is still with thee? O what an <hi>awe</hi> is this to the <hi>careless!</hi> what a <hi>support</hi> to <hi>faith!</hi> what a <hi>quickener</hi> to <hi>duty!</hi> what a <hi>comfort</hi> to the afflicted <hi>troubled</hi> soul! God is in thy poor cottage, Christian, and well acquainted with thy wants. God is at thy bedside when thou are sick, and nearer thee then the nearest of thy friends. What wouldst thou do in want or pain if God stood by? wouldst thou not <hi>Pray</hi> and <hi>Trust</hi> him if thou <hi>sawest</hi> him? so do though thou <hi>see him not,</hi> for he is surely there.</p>
                     <p>5. The <hi>Immensity</hi> and Infinite Greatness of God assureth us of his <hi>Particular Providence.</hi> Some blasphemous Infidels imagine that he hath only a <hi>General Providence,</hi> and hath left all to some inferiour powers, and medleth not with particular things himself: They think that as he hath left it to the Sun to illuminate the world, so hath he left all other inferiour things and events to nature or inferior causes; and that he doth not himself regard, observe, reward or punish the thoughts, and words, and wayes of men. And all this is because they consider not the <hi>Immensity</hi> or Infinite Greatness of the Lord. Its true, that God hath framed the Nature of all things, and delighteth to maintain and use the frame of second causes which he hath made; and will not easily and ordinarily work against or without this order of causes: But it is as true and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain both that <hi>sometimes</hi> he maketh use of <hi>Miracles,</hi> and that in the very <hi>course</hi> of <hi>natural causes</hi> he is able to exercise a <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Providence,</hi> as well as <hi>without them</hi> by himself alone. The <hi>Creature</hi> doth nothing but <hi>by him.</hi> All things move as he first moveth them, in their natural agency. His <hi>wisdom</hi> gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, his <hi>will</hi> intendeth, and commandeth; his <hi>Power</hi> moveth and disposeth all. The <hi>Sun</hi> would not shine, if he were not the <hi>light</hi> of it; and he is no less <hi>himself</hi> the Light of the world, then if he did illuminate it <hi>without a Sun.</hi> God is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the <hi>further off<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> because the <hi>Creatures</hi> are near us; nor ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the <hi>less</hi> in the <hi>effect,</hi> because he useth a <hi>second cause,</hi> then if there were <hi>no</hi> second cause at all. What influence second causes have upon the souls of men, he hath for the most part kept unknown to us; But that <hi>himself</hi> disposeth of us and all
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:59347:24"/>
things after the counsel of his own will, is beyond all question. Can he that is most <hi>neerly present</hi> with thy thoughts, be <hi>regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less</hi> of them? can he be regardless of thy <hi>words</hi> and <hi>wayes</hi> that is <hi>with</hi> thee and seeth and heareth all? If thou believe not that he is as verily with thee as thou art there thy self, thou art then an Atheist. If thou believe him not to be <hi>Infinite,</hi> thou believest him not to be God. It is not <hi>God</hi> that <hi>can</hi> be <hi>absent, limited</hi> or <hi>finite.</hi> And if thou be not such a senseless Atheist, but knowest that God is <hi>everywhere,</hi> how is it possible thou shouldst doubt of his care or observance or particular provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence about every thing? No child is scarce so foolish that will think his Father cares not what he saith or doth, when he stands before him. Wouldst thou doubt of Gods particular providence, whether he <hi>regard</hi> thy <hi>heart,</hi> and <hi>talke</hi> and <hi>pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,</hi> if thou didst <hi>see him</hi> with thee? sure it is scarce possible. Why then dost thou question it when thou <hi>knowest</hi> that he is with thee? If thou be an Atheist and knowest <hi>not,</hi> look about thee on the world, and bethink thee whether stones, and trees, and earth, whether beasts, or birds or men do make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; If they do, thou were best <hi>uphold thy self,</hi> and be not sick, and do not <hi>die.</hi> If thou <hi>madest thy self,</hi> thou canst sure <hi>preserve</hi> thy self; But if any thing else made thee and all these lower things, either it was somewhat <hi>greater</hi> or <hi>less</hi> then they<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> either something <hi>better</hi> or <hi>worse</hi> then they. If <hi>less,</hi> or <hi>worse,</hi> how could it make them <hi>Greater</hi> or <hi>Better</hi> then it self? Can any thing <hi>give</hi> that which it <hi>hath</hi> not? If it must needs be <hi>Greater</hi> and <hi>Better</hi> then the Creatures, then as it must be <hi>Wiser</hi> than they, and more <hi>Holy, Gracious</hi> and <hi>Just</hi> then they, so must it be more <hi>comprehensive</hi> then all they. Whoever made <hi>this earth,</hi> is certainly <hi>greater</hi> then the <hi>earth,</hi> or else he should give it more than he had to give. And if he be <hi>Greater,</hi> he must be <hi>present:</hi> If thou shouldst be so vain as to account <hi>any other</hi> higher thing the Maker of this world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is not <hi>God,</hi> thou must ascribe also a <hi>sufficiency</hi> to that maker, to exercise a particular providence, and moreover be put to consider who did <hi>make that Maker.</hi> Nothing therefore is more certain even to Reason it self, then the Maker of the world must be <hi>Greater</hi> then the <hi>world,</hi> and therefore <hi>present</hi> with all the world; and therefore must <hi>observe</hi> and <hi>regard</hi> all the world. When thou canst find

out a <hi>thought,</hi> or <hi>word,</hi> or <hi>deed</hi> that was not done in the <hi>presence</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> or any creature that is not in his presence, then believe and spare not that he seeth it not, or regardeth it not; yea and that it hath no being. O blind Atheists! you see the Sun be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your eyes, which enlightneth all the upper part of the earth at once; even millions of millions see all by its light; and yet do you doubt whether God beholds and regards and provides for all at once! Tell me, if God had never a Creature to look to in all the world but <hi>thee,</hi> wouldst thou believe that he would regard thy heart, and words, and wayes, or not? If he would, why not <hi>now,</hi> as well as then! Is he not as <hi>suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient</hi> for <hi>thee,</hi> and as really present with thee, as if he had no other creature else? If all men in the world were dead save one, would the <hi>Sun</hi> any more illuminate that one then now it doth? Maist thou not see as well by the light of it now, as if it had never another to enlighten? And dost thou see a <hi>Creature</hi> do so much, and wilt thou not believe as much of the <hi>Creator?</hi> If thou think us worms too low for God so exactly to <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,</hi> thou maist as well think that we are too low for him to <hi>Create,</hi> or <hi>preserve;</hi> and then who made us and preserveth us? Doth not the <hi>sun enlighten</hi> the smallest bird, and crawling vermine, as well as the greatest prince on earth? Doth it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold its light from any Creature that can see, and say, I will not shine on things so base? And wilt thou more restrain the Infinite God that is the Maker, Light, and Life of all? It is he that <hi>filleth all in all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <p>4. THe <hi>Eternity</hi> of God is the next Attribute to be Known<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which also must have its work upon the soul. And 1. This also sheweth us that God is <hi>Incomprehensible;</hi> For man cannot comprehend <hi>Eternity.</hi> When we go about to think of that which hath <hi>no Beginning</hi> nor <hi>End,</hi> it is to <hi>our mind,</hi> as a place a thousand miles off is to <hi>our eye;</hi> even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond our reach; we cannot say <hi>there is no such place,</hi> yea we know <hi>there is;</hi> but <hi>we cannot see it:</hi> so we know there <hi>is an Eternal Being;</hi> but our <hi>Knowledge</hi> of <hi>his Eternity</hi> is not <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitive,</hi> or <hi>comprehensive<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Eternity</hi> therefore is the object of our <hi>faith,</hi> and <hi>reverence,</hi> and <hi>admiration,</hi> but forbids our busie bold enquiries, O the arrogancy of those ignorantly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> learned, and foolishly-wise disputing men, that have so long perplexed, if not torn in pieces the Church, about the <hi>priority</hi> and <hi>poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority</hi> of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>decrees</hi> of God, when they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess them all to be <hi>Eternal!</hi> As if they knew not that terms of <hi>priority, presentiality,</hi> and <hi>posteriority,</hi> have not that signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy in or about <hi>Eternity</hi> as they have with us!</p>
                     <p>2. The <hi>Eternity of God</hi> must draw the soul from <hi>Transitory,</hi> to <hi>Eternal things.</hi> It is an <hi>Everlasting blessedness,</hi> even the <hi>Eternal God,</hi> that our souls are made for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Bruits are
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:59347:25"/>
made for a <hi>mortal</hi> happiness; The <hi>Immortal soul</hi> cannot be fully content with any thing that will have an end. As a <hi>capacity</hi> of this <hi>endless blessedness</hi> doth difference <hi>man</hi> from the <hi>beasts</hi> that perish; so the <hi>Disposition</hi> to it doth difference <hi>Saints</hi> from the <hi>ungodly;</hi> and the <hi>Fruition</hi> of it doth difference the <hi>Glorified</hi> from the <hi>damned.</hi> Alas what a silly thing were <hi>man</hi> if he were capable of nothing but these <hi>transitory</hi> things! What were our <hi>Lives worth,</hi> and what were our <hi>time worth,</hi> and what were all our <hi>mercies worth,</hi> or what were all the <hi>world worth</hi> to us, or what were we worth, our selves? I would not undervalue the works of God; but truly if man had no other life to live but this, I should esteem him a very contemptible creature. If you say that there's some excellency in the Bruits, I answer, True; but their <hi>use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness</hi> is their chiefest excellency; And what is their <hi>use</hi> but to be a glass in which we may see the Lord, and to be servicea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to <hi>man</hi> in his passage to <hi>Eternity?</hi> They are not capable of <hi>Knowing,</hi> or <hi>Loving,</hi> or <hi>enjoying God themselves:</hi> but they are <hi>useful</hi> to <hi>man</hi> that <hi>is capable</hi> of this; and <hi>so</hi> they have an <hi>everlasting end,</hi> and this is their Excellency. And therefore the Atheist that denyeth an <hi>everlasting life to man,</hi> doth bring himself into a far baser state then the <hi>bruits</hi> are in. For the <hi>bruits</hi> have an <hi>everlasting end,</hi> in promoting the <hi>happiness of man:</hi> But if <hi>man</hi> have <hi>no everlasting end</hi> himself, there is no other whose everlasting happiness he can promote. The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believer therefore doth debase his <hi>own soul</hi> and the <hi>whole cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation:</hi> And faith and holiness advance the <hi>soul</hi> and <hi>all things</hi> with it, that are useful to our advancement. The true <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever</hi> honoureth his <hi>horse,</hi> his <hi>dog,</hi> his <hi>food</hi> and <hi>rayment,</hi> and the <hi>earth</hi> he treadeth on, and <hi>every creature,</hi> incomparably more than the <hi>Infidel</hi> doth honour his <hi>own</hi> or any others <hi>soul,</hi> or then he honoureth the <hi>greatest prince</hi> on earth. For the <hi>Believer</hi> useth all things, even the <hi>vilest</hi> in reference to <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;</hi> but the <hi>Infidel</hi> useth his <hi>life</hi> and <hi>soul</hi> but to a <hi>transitory end;</hi> and takes the <hi>greatest Prince</hi> on earth to be but for a <hi>transitory use.</hi> And as <hi>Eternity</hi> is unvalualbe in comparison of <hi>time,</hi> so the <hi>use</hi> and <hi>excellency</hi> that a <hi>Believer</hi> doth ascribe to a <hi>bit of bread</hi> or the <hi>basest creature</hi> in the sanctified improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, is ten thousand times, even unspeakably above the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:59347:26"/>
                        <hi>use</hi> and <hi>excellency</hi> that an <hi>Unbeliever</hi> ascribeth to his <hi>soul</hi> or to his <hi>Prince.</hi> He that stampeth the <hi>Image</hi> of a <hi>Dog</hi> or a <hi>Toad</hi> upon gold instead of the <hi>Image</hi> of the <hi>Prince,</hi> and would have ten thousand pounds-worth goe but for a farthing, doth not by a thousand degrees so much debase the <hi>gold</hi> as the <hi>Infidel</hi> doth debase his <hi>soul</hi> and <hi>all things. Infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> is guilty of the destruction of <hi>all souls,</hi> and the destruction of <hi>all mercies,</hi> and the destruction of <hi>all Divine Revelations,</hi> of <hi>all graces,</hi> of <hi>all ordinances,</hi> and <hi>means,</hi> and of the destruction of the <hi>whole creation</hi> that was made for man: For he that destroyeth the <hi>End,</hi> destroyeth all the <hi>means:</hi> But the <hi>Infidel</hi> destroyeth and <hi>denyeth</hi> the <hi>end</hi> of every one of these, and <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness</hi> only doth give them up and use them to their ends.</p>
                     <p>1. He is guilty of the destruction of <hi>all souls:</hi> For as much as in him lies they are destroyed, while they are all made use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less to the <hi>End</hi> for which they were created. If there be no other <hi>life</hi> and <hi>happiness Everlasting,</hi> what are <hi>souls</hi> good for? what is the Reasonable creature good for? Is it to be Happy <hi>here?</hi> In what? Here is <hi>no happiness.</hi> Is it in eating and drinking and sleeping? why these are to strengthen us for our service which <hi>tendeth</hi> to our <hi>end<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> and therefore cannot be themselves our end. Is it not better be <hi>without</hi> either <hi>meat</hi> or <hi>drink</hi> or <hi>sleep</hi> in point of Happiness, so be it we also were without the <hi>need</hi> of them, then to <hi>need them</hi> and <hi>have them</hi> for our need, especially with the care and trouble which they cost us? I had an hundred times rather for my part, if it were lawful to desire it, never have meat, or drink, or sleep, and be without the need of them, as I had rather be without a sore, then to have a plaister that will ease it, and be every day at the pains to dress it. Brutes have some advantage in these above men, in that they have not the care, and fear, and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of mind as we have, in the getting or keeping what they have or need. If you go <hi>downward,</hi> and say that <hi>men</hi> are made to <hi>govern brutes,</hi> then what are <hi>brutes</hi> made for, unless to dung the earth? and so the basest shall be the end of the noblest, and <hi>God</hi> may be as wisely said to be for <hi>man,</hi> because he is to <hi>govern</hi> him. Truely if there were <hi>no Everlasting life,</hi> but man were a meer terrestrial animal, I had rather never have been born, or should wish I had never been a man: I
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:59347:26"/>
knew not what to do with my self, nor how to imploy the faculties of my soul or body, but they would all seem to me as useless things. What should I do with my <hi>Reason<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> if I had no higher an <hi>end</hi> then <hi>beasts?</hi> what should I do with a <hi>mind</hi> that <hi>knoweth</hi> that there is a God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and another world, and that is capable of desiring him, seeking and enjoying him, if it must be frustrated of all? what should I do with a <hi>heart</hi> thats <hi>capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> of the <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>delighting</hi> in his <hi>Love,</hi> if I have no God to Love and delight in when this life is ended? why have I a heart that so desireth him, in fuller vision and fruition, if I be capable of no such thing? what then should I do with my time and life? verily I know not, if I were fully of this sad opinion, whether I should turn brute in my life agreeably to my judgement, or whether I should make an end of my life to be eased of a useless burden; but confident I am I should not know what to do with my self; I should be like a poor ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shiered Souldier, or like one turned out of his Service, that knew not where to have work and wages: And if you found me standing all day idle, I must give you the reason, because no man hath hired me. What do those wretches do with their lives, that think they have no God to serve and seek, or fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture happiness to attain? As men use to say of <hi>naughty Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,</hi> so may I say of all <hi>mankind</hi> according to the Doctrine of the <hi>Infidels:</hi> A sorry <hi>Taylor</hi> may make a <hi>Botcher,</hi> or a bad <hi>Shoomaker</hi> may make a <hi>Cobler,</hi> and a broken <hi>Mercer</hi> may be a <hi>Pedler;</hi> but a <hi>naughty Priest</hi> is good for <hi>nothing</hi> (And its true of him as such) and as Christ himself saith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 13, 14. <hi>Yee are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted? It is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men: yee are the light of the world: men do not light a candle to put it under a bushel.</hi> So I say of the <hi>Reasonable Creature:</hi> The <hi>grass</hi> is useful for the <hi>beasts:</hi> The <hi>beasts</hi> are serviceable unto <hi>man:</hi> A <hi>swine</hi> that cannot serve you <hi>living,</hi> is useful being <hi>dead.</hi> But if there were <hi>no God</hi> to <hi>seek</hi> and <hi>serve,</hi> and <hi>no life but this</hi> for us to hope for, <hi>for ought</hi> I know man were good for nothing: What were <hi>Light</hi> good for if there were <hi>no eyes?</hi> or <hi>eyes</hi> if there were <hi>no light</hi> to see by? what is a <hi>Watch</hi> good for but to tell the <hi>hour</hi> of the day?

of it, is worth no more then the <hi>mettal</hi> is worth, if it be not useful to its proper end. And what <hi>Reason,</hi> and <hi>will,</hi> and <hi>affections</hi> in man are good for, I know not, if not to <hi>seek,</hi> to <hi>please</hi> and to <hi>enjoy</hi> the Lord! Take off this poise, and all the wheels of <hi>my soul</hi> must stand still, or else do worse.</p>
                     <p>2. The <hi>Infidel</hi> and <hi>ungodly</hi> man that looks not after an <hi>Etern lend,</hi> destroyeth all the <hi>mercies of God,</hi> and makes them as <hi>no mercies</hi> at all: <hi>Creation</hi> and our <hi>Being</hi> is a <hi>mercy:</hi> but it is in order to our <hi>Eternal end. Redemption</hi> by Christ is an unspeakable <hi>mercy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> but its <hi>denyed</hi> by the <hi>Infidel,</hi> and <hi>rejected</hi> by the <hi>Ungodly:</hi> what is <hi>Christ worth,</hi> and all his <hi>mediation,</hi> if there be <hi>no life</hi> for man but <hi>this? Peace</hi> and <hi>Liberty, health</hi> and <hi>life, friends</hi> and <hi>neighbours, food</hi> and <hi>rayment,</hi> are all <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyes</hi> to us, as a <hi>ship</hi> and <hi>sails</hi> are to the <hi>Mariner,</hi> or a <hi>fair way,</hi> or <hi>Horse,</hi> or <hi>Inn</hi> to a <hi>Traveller:</hi> But if by denying our <hi>Eternal end,</hi> you make our <hi>voyage</hi> or our <hi>journey</hi> vain, these mercies then are little worth: no more then a <hi>ship</hi> on the <hi>land,</hi> or a <hi>plow</hi> in the <hi>sea,</hi> or a <hi>horse</hi> to him that hath no use for him. And O what an ungrateful wretch is that who will deny <hi>all the mercies</hi> of God to himself, and to all others! For once deny the <hi>use</hi> and the <hi>Eternal end,</hi> and you deny the mercy.</p>
                     <p>3. He that believeth not, or seeks not after an <hi>Eternal end,</hi> destroyeth all the <hi>Doctrine, Law</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> of God: For all is but to lead us to <hi>this end.</hi> All the holy Scriptures, the precepts of Christ and his holy example, the Covenant of Grace, the gifts and miracles of the Holy Ghost, the light and law of Nature it self, are all to bring us to our Eternal end: And therefore he that denyeth that end, doth cancel them all, and cast them by as useless things.</p>
                     <p>4. And he denyeth all the <hi>Graces of the Spirit:</hi> For what use is there for <hi>Faith,</hi> if the <hi>object</hi> of it be a falshood? what use for <hi>Hope,</hi> if there be no <hi>life</hi> to be <hi>Hoped for?</hi> what use for holy <hi>desires</hi> and <hi>love,</hi> if God be not to be <hi>enjoyed?</hi> Grace is but the <hi>delusion</hi> and <hi>deformity</hi> of the soul, if the <hi>Infidel</hi> and <hi>ungodly</hi> be in the right.</p>
                     <p>5. They destroy also <hi>All the means</hi> of our Salvation, if they deny <hi>Salvation</hi> which is the <hi>End.</hi> To what purpose should men <hi>study,</hi> or <hi>read,</hi> or <hi>hear,</hi> or <hi>pray,</hi> or use either <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments</hi> or any other <hi>means,</hi> for an <hi>End</hi> that is not to be had?
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:59347:27"/>
To what end should men <hi>obey</hi> or <hi>suffer,</hi> for any such <hi>end</hi> thats not attainable?</p>
                     <p>6. Yea they do <hi>let loose the soul to sin,</hi> and take off all esse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual restraint. If there be <hi>no Eternal end,</hi> and <hi>no Reward</hi> or <hi>Punishment</hi> but <hi>here,</hi> what can effectually hinder the men of this opinion from stealing, whoredome, or any villany when it may be done with secrecy? what should hinder the revenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful man from poisoning or secret murdering his enemy, or setting his house on fire in the night? If I know a man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that believes no life to come, I take it for granted they are revengeful, thieves, deceivers, fornicators, or any thing that is bad, if they have but temptation and secret opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.

Merrily you run down the Hill; but where's the <hi>bottom!</hi> If you look but down from the top of a steeple, it may occasion an amazing fear; what then should it cause in you to look down <hi>into Hill,</hi> which is <hi>your Eternity?</hi> No <hi>good</hi> can possibly be <hi>small</hi> that is <hi>Eternal;</hi> And no <hi>hurt</hi> or <hi>pain</hi> can be called <hi>little</hi> that is <hi>Eternal:</hi> An <hi>Eternal tooth-ake,</hi> or an <hi>Eternal gowt,</hi> or <hi>stone,</hi> or <hi>feaver,</hi> were a misery unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; But O what are these to an <hi>Eternal loss of Heaven,</hi> and to an <hi>Eternal sense of the burning wrath of God Almighty!</hi> To be <hi>out of Heaven</hi> a day, <hi>and in Hell</hi> that day, is a misery <hi>now</hi> unknown to sinners; But if it were as many thousand years as the earth hath sands, it were a <hi>greater</hi> Misery; But to be there for <hi>Ever,</hi> doth make the <hi>Misery</hi> past all <hi>Hope,</hi> and all <hi>conceiving.</hi> O me thinks the very <hi>name</hi> of <hi>Eternity,</hi> should frighten the drunkard out of the Alehouse, and the sleepy sinner out of his security, and the lustful, sportful, voluptuous sinner out of his sensual delights! Methinks the very <hi>name</hi> of <hi>Eternity,</hi> should call off the worldling to seek betime a more enduring treasure, and should take down the gallants pride, and bring men to look after other matters then the most do look after. Me thinks to hear the <hi>name</hi> of <hi>Eternity</hi> should with men of any faith and reason, even blast all the beauty, and blurre the glory, and sadden the delights, and weaken the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:59347:32"/>
temptations of the world, and make all its pleasure, pomp and splendour, to be to our apprehensions as a smoak, a shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, as the dirt that we tread upon. Methinks to hear the name of Eternity, should lay so odious a reproach on sin, and so nakedly open the folly, and shame and misery of the ungodly, and so lively shew the <hi>need,</hi> and <hi>worth</hi> of <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>Holiness,</hi> that men should be soon resolved in their choice, and soon be at the end of an ungodly course, and need no more words to make them the resolved servants of the Lord, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to morrow. O me thinks, that a <hi>thought</hi> of <hi>Eternity,</hi> should with a <hi>Believer,</hi> answer all <hi>temptations,</hi> and <hi>put life</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all his prayers and endeavours! If we were never so cold, or dull, or sleepy, one would think a serious thought of <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> should warm us, quicken us, and awake us! <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>O Christians, shall we <hi>hear</hi> carelesly or <hi>speak</hi> carelesly of <hi>Eternity?</hi> shall we <hi>pray</hi> coldly, or labour negligently for <hi>Eternity!</hi> O what an Ocean of Joy will <hi>Eternity</hi> be unto the sanctified! It hath neither banks nor bottom. O what a gulf of misery, and woe, will <hi>Eternity</hi> be to the ungodly! wonderful! that on their dying beds they quake not with the horrour, and that they cry not out with greatest lamentation, to think what a bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomless gulf of misery their departing souls must be cast into! To be for <hi>Ever, Ever, Ever,</hi> under the most heavy wrath of God! <hi>This</hi> is the appointed wages of ungodliness; <hi>This</hi> is the end of wicked wayes; <hi>This</hi> is it that sinners chose, because they would not live to God! <hi>This</hi> they preferred, or ventured on, before a holy heavenly life! And <hi>this</hi> is it that Believers are labouring to escape in all their holy care and diligence! It is an Infinite value that is put upon the blood of Christ, the promises of God, the ordinances and means of Grace, and grace it self, and the poorest duties of the poorest Saints, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are for an <hi>Infinite, Eternal glory.</hi> No <hi>Mercy</hi> is <hi>small</hi> that <hi>tasts</hi> of <hi>Heaven</hi> (as all doth or should do to the Believer.) No <hi>action</hi> is <hi>low</hi> that <hi>aims</hi> at <hi>Heaven.</hi> And O how <hi>lively</hi> should the Resolutions and courage of those men be, that are travelling, sighting, and watching for <hi>Eternity!</hi> How full should be their <hi>Comforts,</hi> that are fetcht from the foresight of <hi>Infinite Eternal Comforts!</hi> As all things will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently be swallowed up in <hi>Eternity,</hi> so methinks the present ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:59347:32"/>
of <hi>Eternity</hi> should now swallow up all things else in the soul.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> But (<hi>saith the Unbeliever</hi>) if God have made man for Eternity, it is a wonder that there are no more lively Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of so Infinite a thing upon the souls of all! Our sense of it is so small, that it makes me doubt whether we are made for it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Consider, 1. That benummedness, and sleep and death, is the very state of an unholy soul! Hast thou cast thy self into a sleepy senseless disease, and wilt thou argue thence against Eternity? This is as if the blind should conclude that there is no Sun, or that the eye of man was not made to see it, because he hath no sight himself! Or as if you should think that man hath not any life or feeling, because your palsie limbs do not feel! Or that the stomack was not made for meat, because the stomacks of the sick abhor it!</p>
                     <p>2. And for believers, 1. You may see by their lives that they have some apprehensions of <hi>Eternity:</hi> why else do they differ from you, and deny themselves, and displease the world and the flesh it self? why do they set their hearts above, if they have not lively thoughts of an <hi>Eternity!</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. But if you aske me, <hi>Why their apprehensions are not a thousand times more lively about so Infinite a thing;</hi> I answer, 1. Their Apprehensions must be suitable to their <hi>State.</hi> Our <hi>state</hi> here is a state of <hi>Imperfection;</hi> and so will our apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions be; But a perfect state will have perfect apprehensions. It is no proof that the Infant in the womb is not made to come into this world, and see the Sun, and converse with men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he hath <hi>no apprehensions</hi> of it. Our state here is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of the soul to a frail distempered body; and so neer a conjunction, that the actions of the soul must have great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance on the <hi>Body;</hi> And therefore our Apprehensions are limited by <hi>its frailty;</hi> and the soul can go no higher then the capacity of the <hi>Body</hi> will allow; 2. And our Apprehensions now are fitted to our <hi>Use and benefit;</hi> We are now <hi>Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,</hi> and must <hi>live by faith:</hi> And therefore must not be <hi>Behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> and <hi>live by sense.</hi> If <hi>Eternity</hi> were open to mens <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral sight,</hi> or we had here as <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>lively</hi> apprehensions of it, as those have that are <hi>there,</hi> then it were not thanks, no praise
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:59347:33"/>
to us to be <hi>believers,</hi> or to <hi>obey,</hi> and live as Saints! And then God should not Govern man as man here in the way by a Law, but as a beast by <hi>sense,</hi> or as the glorified that have <hi>pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session.</hi> Where there are perfect Apprehensions of God and Glory, there will be also perfect Love, and Joy, and Praise, and consequently perfect Happiness; and this were to make <hi>Earth</hi> and <hi>Heaven,</hi> the <hi>way</hi> and the <hi>end</hi> to be <hi>all one.</hi> Perfect appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions are kept for a perfect state of Happiness. But here it is well if we have such Apprehensions as are fitted to the use of <hi>travellers</hi> and <hi>soldiers</hi> as will carry us on, and prevail against the difficulties of our course. If you had never been at <hi>London,</hi> you could not have any such <hi>clear Apprehensions</hi> of the place, as those that see it have; And yet your <hi>imperfect Apprehensions</hi> might be sufficient to make you take a <hi>journey thither,</hi> and you may come as <hi>safely</hi> and <hi>certainly</hi> to it, as if you had <hi>seen</hi> it. Moreover, the body, the brain, which the soul in Apprehending now makes use of, <hi>cannot bear</hi> such Apprehensions as are suitable to the thousandth part of the greatness of the object, without distraction. The <hi>smallest eye</hi> may <hi>see</hi> the <hi>sun,</hi> but the <hi>greatest</hi> cannot endure to <hi>gaze</hi> upon its <hi>Glory;</hi> much less if it were at the <hi>neerest</hi> approach. Its a mercy o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>4. Lastly, The <hi>Eternity of God</hi> must teach the soul <hi>content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness and patience</hi> under all labours, changes, sufferings and dangers that are here below. Believing Soul, draw neer; look seriously on <hi>Eternity,</hi> and try whether it will not make such Impressions as these upon thee. Art thou <hi>weary</hi> of <hi>Labours,</hi> either of the mind or body? Is not <hi>Eternity long enough</hi> for thy <hi>Rest?</hi> Canst thou not afford to <hi>work out</hi> the day light of this life, when thou must <hi>Rest with Christ</hi> to all <hi>Eternity?</hi> Canst thou not <hi>run with patience</hi> so short a <hi>race,</hi> when thou lookest to so long a Rest? Canst thou <hi>not watch one hour</hi> with Christ, that must <hi>Reign with him to all Eternity?</hi> Dost thou begin to shrinke at <hi>sufferings</hi> for <hi>Christ,</hi> when thou must be in <hi>Glory</hi> with him <hi>for ever?</hi> How <hi>short</hi> is the <hi>suffering?</hi> how <hi>long</hi> is the <hi>Reward?</hi> Dost thou begin to think hatdly of

to draw back and venture upon sin? why what Temptation can there be, that should not be lighter then a feather, if Eternity be put against it in the scales? In a Word, if there be any man that escapeth the foolish seductions of this world, and useth it as not abusing it, and hath all his worldly accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modations as if he had none, it is he that fixeth his eye upon <hi>Eternity,</hi> and seeth that the <hi>fashion of</hi> these lower things <hi>doth pass away,</hi> 1 Cor. 7. 29, 30, 31.

                     <p>5. THe next Attribute of God, that is to make its <hi>Impress</hi> on us, is, that <hi>He is a spirit.</hi> In this <hi>One</hi> are these <hi>three</hi> especially comprehended: 1. That he is <hi>Simple,</hi> and not material or <hi>compounded</hi> as bodies are; 2. That he is <hi>Invisible,</hi> and not to be <hi>seen</hi> as <hi>Bodies</hi> are: 3. That he is <hi>Immortal</hi> and <hi>Incorruptible,</hi> and not subject to death or change, as <hi>Bodies</hi> are.</p>
                     <p>1. As <hi>simplicity</hi> signifieth <hi>unity</hi> in opposition to <hi>Multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city</hi> we have spoken of it before. As it is opposite to all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriality, <hi>mixture</hi> or <hi>composition,</hi> we are now to speak of it: And the believing thoughts of Gods immateriality and <hi>simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,</hi> should have these three effects upon the soul. 1. It should do much to win the heart to God, and cause it to close with him as its felicity: Because as he hath no matter or mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, so he hath nothing but pure and perfect Goodness, and therefore there is nothing in him to discourage the soul. The Creatures have evil in them with their good, and by contrary qualities do hurt us when they help us, and displease us when
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:59347:36"/>
they please us: But in <hi>God</hi> there is nothing but <hi>Insinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi> And should not the soul adhere to him, where it is sure to find nothing but simple, pure and unmixed good? The Creatures are all lyable to some exceptions: In one thing they help us, but in another they hinder us; in one thing they are suitable to us, and in another thing unsuitable! But God is lyable to no exceptions. This will for ever confound the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly that gave not up themselves unto him: They did even for a thing of nought forsake that God that was <hi>purely</hi> and <hi>simply</hi> good, and against whom they had <hi>no exceptions.</hi> Had there been <hi>any thing</hi> in God to discourage the soul, or which his most malicious enemy could blame, the ungodly soul had some excuse. But this will stop all the mouths of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, that they had <hi>nothing</hi> to say against the Lord, and yet they had no mind to him, no hearts for him, in comparison of the vain vexatious Creatures.</p>
                     <p>2. The simplicity of God should make us know the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and vanity of all the Creatures that are compounded things; and so should help to alienate us from them. Our <hi>friends</hi> have in them perhaps <hi>much holyness,</hi> but mixed with <hi>much sin.</hi> They may have <hi>much knowledge;</hi> but mixed with <hi>much ignorance.</hi> Their <hi>humility</hi> is mixt with <hi>Pride;</hi> their <hi>meekness</hi> with some <hi>Passions,</hi> their <hi>love</hi> with <hi>selfishness,</hi> and a small matter will cause them to distast us: They may be much <hi>for God;</hi> but withall they may <hi>do much</hi> against him. They <hi>help</hi> the Church; but through their weakness they may la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentably <hi>detract</hi> or <hi>wrong</hi> it: They are <hi>able</hi> to help us but <hi>in part;</hi> and <hi>willing</hi> but in <hi>part;</hi> and they have usually <hi>interests</hi> of their <hi>own,</hi> that are inconsistent with <hi>ours.</hi> We have no <hi>Commodity,</hi> but hath its <hi>discommodity:</hi> Our houses, our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, our neighbours, our callings, our cattle, our land, our Countries, Churches, Ministers, Magistrates, Laws and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, yea even health, and plenty, and peace it self, all have their <hi>Mixtures</hi> of <hi>bitterness</hi> or <hi>danger,</hi> and those the <hi>most dangerous</hi> commonly that have <hi>least bitterness.</hi> But <hi>in God</hi> there is none of all this <hi>Mixture,</hi> but <hi>Pure uncompounded</hi> Good. <hi>He is light, and with him is no darkness,</hi> 1 Joh. 1. 5. Indeed there is somewhat in God that an ungodly man distast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and that seemeth in the state that he is in to be against
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:59347:37"/>
him and hurtful to him: as is his <hi>Justice, Holiness, Truth,</hi> &amp;c. But <hi>Justice</hi> is not <hi>evil,</hi> because it doth condemn a <hi>Thief</hi> or <hi>Murderer: Meat</hi> is not <hi>bad</hi> because the <hi>sick</hi> distast it. It is the <hi>cross position</hi> of the sinful soul, or his <hi>enmity</hi> to the Lord, that makes the Lord to use him as an enemy.

                     <p>3. Gods <hi>simplicity</hi> must draw the <hi>soul</hi> to a <hi>holy simplicity,</hi> that it may be <hi>like to God.</hi> We that se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

As we would not <hi>bow the knee</hi> to any gods but one, so neither should we bow the <hi>heart</hi> or <hi>life</hi> to them. We should know what is Gods prerogative, and that we should keep entirely for him. A subordinate esteem, and love, and desire the Creature may have, as it revealeth God to us, or leadeth to him, or helpeth us in his work: But it should not have the least of <hi>his</hi> part in our esteem, or love, or desire. This is the Chastity, the Purity, the Integrity of the soul. It is the mixture, impurity, corruption and consusion of our souls, when any thing is taken in with God. See therefore Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an that <hi>in thy heart</hi> thou have no <hi>God but ONE,</hi> and that he have <hi>all thy heart,</hi> and <hi>soul,</hi> and <hi>strength</hi> as far as thou canst attain it. And because there will be still in imperfect souls, some sinful mixture of the Creatures interest with Gods, let it be the work of thy life to be watching against it, and casting it out, and cleansing thy heart of it, as thou wouldst do thy

food if it fall into the dirt. For whatever is <hi>added to God</hi> in thy <hi>Affections,</hi> doth make no better an increase there, then the adding of <hi>earth</hi> unto thy <hi>gold,</hi> or of <hi>dung</hi> unto thy <hi>meat,</hi> or of corrupted <hi>humours</hi> and <hi>sickness</hi> to thy body. <hi>Mixture</hi> will make no better work.</p>
                     <p>It may be thy <hi>Rejoycing</hi> if thou have <hi>the testimony of a good conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, and not in fleshly wisdome, but by the grace of God, thou hast had thy conversation in the world,</hi> 2 Cor. 1. 12. It is the state of Hypocrisie, when <hi>One God</hi> is openly professed and worshipped, and yet the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture lyeth deepest and nearest to the heart.</p>
                     <p>2. The <hi>Invisibility</hi> of God also must have its due effects upon us. And, 1. It must warn us, that we <hi>picture</hi> not God to our eye sight, or in our fancies in any <hi>bodily shape.</hi> Saith the Prophet, <hi>Isa.</hi> 40. 18. <hi>To whom will you liken God? or what likeness will ye compare unto him?</hi> so 25. [<hi>No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son which is in the bosome of his Father, he hath declared him,</hi> Joh. 1. 18. and therefore we must conceive of him but as he <hi>is declared,</hi> Joh. 6. 46. <hi>Not that any man hath seen the Father, save he which is of God, he hath seen the Father.</hi>]</p>
                     <p>If you ask me, How then you should conceive of God, if not in any Bodily shape? I answer, Get all these Attributes, and Relations of God to make their proper Impress upon thy soul, as now I am teaching you, and then you will have the true Conceiving of God: This Question therefore is to be answered at the end of this Discourse, when you have seen all the Attributes of God together, and heard what impression they must make upon you.</p>
                     <p>2. This must teach us, to think <hi>most highly</hi> of the <hi>things</hi> that are <hi>Invisible,</hi> and <hi>meanlier</hi> of these <hi>visible things.</hi> Let it be the property of a <hi>Beast</hi> and not of a <hi>man,</hi> to know nothing but what he <hi>seeth</hi> or hath <hi>seen:</hi> Let it be the mark of the bruitish Insidels, and not of Christians to doubt of the <hi>invisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things</hi> because they are <hi>invisible;</hi> or to think that things <hi>visible</hi> are more <hi>excellent</hi> or <hi>sure.</hi> As the <hi>senses</hi> are more ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble then the <hi>Intellect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> (a beast having as perfect senses as a man, and yet no reasonable understanding) so the objects of sense must proportionably be below the Objects of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:59347:38"/>
as such. The <hi>grossest</hi> and most <hi>palpable</hi> objects are the <hi>basest.</hi> It is the <hi>subtle</hi> part thats called the <hi>Spirits,</hi> which being drawn out of plants or other vegetables is most <hi>powerful</hi> and <hi>excellent,</hi> and valued, when the <hi>earthly dregs</hi> are cast away as little worth. It is that <hi>subtle</hi> part in our <hi>blood</hi> thats called the <hi>Spirits,</hi> that hath more of the <hi>virtue</hi> of <hi>life,</hi> and <hi>doth</hi> more of the <hi>works</hi> then the <hi>feculent gross</hi> and <hi>earthly</hi> part. The <hi>aire</hi> and <hi>wind</hi> have as true a <hi>Being</hi> as the <hi>Earth,</hi> and a more <hi>excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent</hi> nature, though <hi>it</hi> be more <hi>gross,</hi> and <hi>they invisible.</hi> The <hi>Body</hi> is not so excellent as the <hi>invisible soul. Invisible</hi> things are as <hi>real</hi> as <hi>visible,</hi> and as <hi>suitable</hi> to our more noble invisible part, as visible things to our fleshly baser part.</p>
                     <p>3. The <hi>invisibility</hi> of God must teach us to <hi>Live a life of Faith,</hi> and to get above a <hi>sensual life:</hi> And it must teach us to value the <hi>faith</hi> of the Saints, as knowing its excellency and necessity. <hi>Invisible</hi> objects have the most perfect excellent Reality; and therefore <hi>Faith</hi> hath the preheminence above <hi>sense. Natural Reason</hi> can live upon things <hi>not seen</hi> if they <hi>have been seen,</hi> or can be <hi>known</hi> by <hi>natural evidence</hi> (subjects obey a Prince that they <hi>see not:</hi> and fear a punishment which they <hi>see not:</hi> and the nature of man is afraid of the <hi>Devils</hi> though we <hi>see them not.</hi>) But <hi>Faith</hi> liveth upon <hi>such invisible</hi> things, as <hi>mortal</hi> eye did <hi>never see,</hi> nor natural ordinary evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence demonstrate, but are revealed only by the Word of God: though about many of its <hi>invisible objects, Faith</hi> hath the consent of <hi>Reason</hi> for its encouragement. Value not <hi>sight</hi> and <hi>sense</hi> too much. Think not all to be meer <hi>uncertainties</hi> and <hi>notions</hi> that are not the objects of <hi>sense.</hi> We should not have heard that <hi>God is a spirit,</hi> if <hi>Corporal substances</hi> had not a <hi>baser</hi> kind of <hi>Being</hi> then <hi>Spirits: Intellection</hi> is a more noble opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then <hi>sense.</hi> If there be any thing properly called <hi>sense</hi> in <hi>Heaven,</hi> it will be as far below the pure <hi>Intellective Intuition</hi> of the Lord, as the <hi>glorified Body</hi> will be below the <hi>glorified soul.</hi> But what that difference will be, we cannot now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand. Fix not your minds on <hi>sensible</hi> things. Remember that your <hi>God,</hi> your <hi>home,</hi> your <hi>portion</hi> are <hi>unseen:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore live in hearty Affections to them, and serious prosecution of them as if you <hi>saw</hi> them. Pray as if you <hi>saw God,</hi> and <hi>Heaven,</hi> and <hi>Hell. Hear</hi> as if you <hi>saw him</hi> that sends his
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:59347:38"/>
Messenger to speak to you. Resist all the Temptations to lust, and sensuality, and every sin, as you would do if you <hi>saw God</hi> stand by. Love him, and Fear him, and Trust him, and Serve him, as you would do if you beheld him. <hi>Faith is the evidence of things not seen,</hi> Heb. 11. 1. <hi>Believing</hi> must be to you in stead of <hi>seeing;</hi> and make you as serious about things unseen, as sensual men are about things sensible. In every thing that you see, remember it is <hi>he that is unseen</hi> that appeareth in them. He lighteth you by the sun; he warmeth you by the fire; he beareth you by the earth. See <hi>him</hi> in all these by the eye of Faith.</p>
                     <p>3. The <hi>Immortality, Incorruptibility</hi> and <hi>Immutability</hi> of God, must 1. Teach the soul to rise up from these <hi>Mortal, Corruptible, Mutable</hi> things, and to fix upon that God who is the immortal, incorruptible portion of his Saints.</p>
                     <p>2. It must comfort and encourage all Believers in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of their felicity; and support them under the fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of all mortal, corruptible things. Our Parents, and Children, and Friends are mortal: They are ours to day, and dead to morrow: They are our delight to day, and our sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row or horrour to morrow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But our <hi>God</hi> is <hi>Immortal.</hi> Our <hi>houses</hi> may be <hi>burned:</hi> Our <hi>goods</hi> may be consumed or stolne; our <hi>cloaths</hi> will be worn out; our <hi>treasure</hi> here may be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted. But our <hi>God</hi> is <hi>unchangeable,</hi> the same for ever. Our <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Customes</hi> may be changed; our <hi>Governours</hi> and <hi>Priviledges</hi> changed; our company, and employments, and habitation changed: but <hi>our God</hi> is never changed. Our estates may change from Riches to poverty; and our names that were honoured may incur disgrace. Our health may quickly turn to sickness, and our ease to pain: But still <hi>our God</hi> is <hi>unchangeable</hi> for ever. Our <hi>friends</hi> are unconstant and may turn our enemies: Our Peace may be changed into war; and our liberty into slavery: but our <hi>God</hi> doth never change. Time will change customes, families and all things here: but it changeth not our God. The <hi>Creatures</hi> are all but earthen mettal, and quickly dasht in peices: our <hi>comforts</hi> are change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; <hi>our selves</hi> are changeable and mortal: but so is not <hi>our God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. And it should teach us to draw as <hi>near to God</hi> as we are
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:59347:39"/>
capable, by <hi>unchangeable fixed Resolutions,</hi> and <hi>constancy</hi> of endeavours; and to be still the same as we are at the best.</p>
                     <p>4. It should move us also to be more desirous of passing into the state of <hi>immortality,</hi> and to long for our <hi>unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> habitation, and our <hi>immortal, incorruptible</hi> Bodies, and to possess the <hi>Kingdom that cannot be moved,</hi> Heb. 12. 28. And let not the <hi>mutability</hi> of things below much trouble us, while our <hi>Rock,</hi> our <hi>Portion</hi> is unmoveable. <hi>God</hi> waxeth not old: Heaven doth not decay by duration: the Glory of the blessed shall not wither, nor their sun set upon them, nor their <hi>day</hi> have any <hi>night;</hi> nor any mutations or commotions disturb their quiet possessions. O Love and Long for Immortality and Incorruption!</p>

                     <p>6. HAving spoken of the effects of the Attributes of <hi>Gods Essence</hi> as such, we must next speak of the Effects of his three great Attributes which some call <hi>Subsistential,</hi> that is his <hi>Omnipotency, Understanding</hi> and <hi>Will;</hi> or his <hi>Infinite Power, Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Goodness:</hi> By which it hath been the way of the Schoolmen and other Divines to denominate the three <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi> not without some countenance from Scripture Phrase. The Father they call the <hi>Infinite Power</hi> of the God head; and the Son, the <hi>Wisdom and Word of God,</hi> and of the <hi>Father:</hi> and the Holy Ghost, <hi>the Love and Goodness of God, of the Father and Son.</hi> But that these Attributes, of <hi>Power, Understanding</hi> and <hi>Will,</hi> or <hi>Power, Wisdome</hi> and <hi>Goodness,</hi> are of the same importance with the termes of Personality, <hi>Father, Son</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> we presume not to affirm. It sufficeth us, 1. That God hath assumed these Attributes to himself in Scripture. 2. And that <hi>man</hi> who beareth the <hi>Natural Image</hi> of God, hath <hi>Power, Understanding</hi> and <hi>Will;</hi> and as he beareth the <hi>Holy Moral Image</hi> of God, he hath a <hi>Power</hi> to execute that which is <hi>Good,</hi> and <hi>Wisdome to direct,</hi> and <hi>Goodness</hi> of <hi>Will</hi> to determine for the execution: And so while God is seen of us in this <hi>Glass of Man,</hi> we must conceive of him after the <hi>Image</hi>
                        <pb n="51" facs="tcp:59347:39"/>
that <hi>in man</hi> appeareth to us, and speak of him in the <hi>language of man,</hi> as he doth of himself.</p>
                     <p>And first, The <hi>Almightiness of God</hi> must make these im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions on our souls. 1. It must possess the soul with very <hi>awful Reverent thoughts of God;</hi> and fill us continually with his <hi>holy Fear. Infinite Greatness</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> must have no common careless thoughts, lest we <hi>Blaspheme</hi> him in our <hi>Minds,</hi> and be guilty of <hi>Contempt.</hi> The Dread of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Majesty should be still upon us; and we must <hi>be in his fear all the day long,</hi> Prov. 23. 17. Not under that <hi>slavish Fear</hi> that is void of <hi>Love,</hi> as men fear an Enemy, or hurtful Creature, or that which is <hi>Evil:</hi> For we have not such a spirit from the Lord, nor stand in a Relation of <hi>enmity</hi> and <hi>bondage</hi> to him: But <hi>Reverence</hi> is necessary; and from thence a Fear of <hi>sinning</hi> and <hi>displeasing</hi> so Great a God. <hi>The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdome,</hi> Prov. 1. 7. and 9. 10. Psal. 111. 10. <hi>By it men depart from evil,</hi> Prov. 16. 6. Sin is for want of the <hi>Fear of God,</hi> Luk. 23. 40. Pro. 3. 7. Jer. 5. 24. I. ev. 25. 36. The <hi>Fear of God</hi> is often put for the whole <hi>new man,</hi> or all the work of Grace within us, even the Principle of new life; <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 19. and 32. 40. And it is often put for the whole work of <hi>Religion</hi> or <hi>Service of God,</hi> Psal. 34. 11. Prov. 1. 29. Psal. 130. 4. and 34. 9. And therefore the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are usually denominated, such as <hi>Fear God,</hi> Psal. 15. 4. and 22. 23. and 115. 11, 13. and 135. 20. and 34. 7, 9. &amp;c. The godly are <hi>devoted to the Fear of God,</hi> Psal. 119. 38. It is our <hi>Sanctifying the Lord in our hearts, that he be our fear and dread,</hi> Isa. 8. 13. If we <hi>Fear him</hi> not, we take him not for our <hi>Master,</hi> Mal. 1. 6. Evangelical Grace excludeth not this <hi>Fear,</hi> Luk. 12. 5. <hi>Though we receive a Kingdom that cannot be moved, yet must our acceptable service of God, be with Reverence and godly fear,</hi> Heb. 12. 28. <hi>With fear and trembling we must work out our salvation,</hi> Phil. 2. 12. <hi>In fear we must pass the time of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:59347:40"/>
puts this fear in the hearts of those that shall not depart from him,</hi> Jer. 32. 40. See therefore that the <hi>Greatness</hi> of the <hi>Almighty God</hi> possess thy soul continually with his <hi>Fear.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. <hi>Gods Almightiness</hi> should also possess us with holy <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of him,</hi> and cause us in heart and voice to <hi>Magnifie</hi> him. Oh what a <hi>Power</hi> is that which made the world of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing? which upholdeth the <hi>earth</hi> without any foundation but his Will? which placed and maintaineth all things in their <hi>Order</hi> in Heaven and Earth! which causeth so great and glorious a creature as the <hi>Sun,</hi> that is so much bigger then all the earth, to move so many thousand miles in a few moments, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly to keep its time and course! that giveth its instinct to every brute, and causeth every part of nature, to do its office<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> By <hi>his Power</hi> it is that every motion of the Creature is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and that order is kept in the Kingdoms of the world. <hi>Jer.</hi> 32. 17, 18, 19. [<hi>He made the Heaven and the Earth by his Great Power and stretched out arm, and nothing is too hard for him: The Great, the Mighty God, the Lord of Hosts is his Name; great in counsel, and mighty in works</hi>] Neh. 9. 32. <hi>The Great, the Mighty, the terrible God,</hi>] Psal. 136. 4. <hi>To him therefore that alone doth Great wonders</hi> we must give the <hi>Greatest Praise] O how Great are his works, and his thoughts are very deep,</hi> Psal. 92. 5.

                     </p>
                     <p>3. In the Church where <hi>he is known, must his Name be Great,</hi> Psal. 76. 1. <hi>For we know that the Lord is Great, and our God is above all Gods,</hi> Psal. 135. 5. His Saints delight to praise his <hi>Greatness:</hi> Psal. 104. 1, 2, 3, 4. [<hi>Bless the Lord O my soul! O Lord my God thou art very Great: thou art cloathed with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Majesty, who coverest thy self with Light as with a garment, who stretchest out the Heavens like a Curtain, who lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the beams of his Chambers in the waters, who maketh the clouds his Chariot, who walketh upon the wings of the wind, who maketh his Angels Spirits, his Ministers a flame of fire,</hi> &amp;c.] From <hi>Almightiness</hi> all things have their being, and therefore must honour the <hi>Almighty,</hi> Rev. 1. 8. [<hi>I am Alpha and Ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga, the beginning and the ending; saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty</hi>] Rev. 15. 3.
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:59347:40"/>
They that magnifie the Lord with the <hi>song of</hi> Moses <hi>and of the Lamb,</hi> say [<hi>Great and Marvellous are thy works, O Lord God Almighty; Just and True are thy wayes thou King of Saints.</hi>]</p>
                     <p>3. The <hi>Almightiness of God</hi> must imprint upon our souls a <hi>strong and stedfast confidence in him,</hi> according to the tenour of his Covenant and promises. Nothing more certain then that <hi>Impotency and Insufficiency</hi> will never cause him to fail us or to break his word. O what an encouragement is it to the Saints, that they are built on such an impregnable Rock, and that <hi>Omnipotency</hi> is engaged for them! And O what a shame is this to our <hi>unbelief,</hi> that ever we should distrust <hi>omnipotency!</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If God be <hi>Almighty,</hi> 1. Remembe in thy <hi>greatest wants,</hi> that there is no want but he can easily and abundantly supply.</p>
                     <p>2. Remember in thy greatest <hi>sufferings, pains,</hi> or <hi>dangers,</hi> that no <hi>pain</hi> is so great which he cannot mitigate and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move, and no <hi>danger</hi> so great from which he is not able to deliver thee. The servants of Christ dare venture on the flames, because they trust upon the <hi>Almighty,</hi> Dan. 3. 16, 17, 18.

Dost thou think it improbable that ever all thy sins should be conquered? and that ever thy soul should live with Christ among the holy Saints and Angels? and that ever thy Body that must first be dust, should shine as the stars in the firmament of God?

                     <p>4.

                     <p>7. THe next Attribute that must work upon us, is the <hi>Infinite Wisdom,</hi> or <hi>Omniscience</hi> of God. <hi>Psal.</hi> 147. 5. <hi>His understandig is Infinite</hi>] And the Impressions that this should make upon our souls are these.</p>
                     <p>1. <hi>Delight in Wisdom,</hi> that you may in your places be <hi>like to God.</hi> The <hi>New man</hi> is <hi>renewed in knowledge after the Image of him that Created him,</hi> Col. 3. 10. If God be <hi>infinitely Wise,</hi> those then are the most excellent that are the <hi>Wisest. Ignorance</hi> is the souls <hi>blindness,</hi> and the privation of the Image of God on the understanding. [<hi>Wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth darkness,</hi> Eccles. 2. 13.] To desire as <hi>Adam</hi> did any of that Knowledge that God hath reserved to himself, or is unnecessary for us, is not indeed to be <hi>Wise</hi> in our desires: <hi>Unnecessary Knowledge</hi> is but a trouble. But to Know the Lord, and his revealed Will; and the way of life, is the light and glory of our minds. He that hath lost his eye sight, hath lost his principal natural delight, and is as out of the world while he is in it. And the ignorant souls that are void of the <hi>heavenly Illumination,</hi> must needs be void of the delights of Grace: and though they live in the visible Church, where the beauty of Holiness is the excellency of the Saints, yet they do not <hi>see</hi> this <hi>beauty,</hi> but are like the Infidels that are <hi>out</hi> of the Church while they are in it. The <hi>Blind</hi> are in continual <hi>danger;</hi> They know not where they set their feet. And they know not when to be confident, nor
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:59347:43"/>
when to fear; sometimes they are afraid where there is no cause, because there <hi>may be</hi> cause for ought they know; And sometime they are fearless at the very brink of death, and little think of the evil that they are neer. Why do our poor deluded people so boldly live in an unconverted state, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they Know not where they are? Why do they so care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly lie down and rise in an unsanctified condition, unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, unready for death and judgement, and under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of the Law, but because they <hi>know not</hi> the misery or danger in which they stand? Why do they go on so carelesly and wilfully in sin, and despise the counsel of their Teachers and of the Lord, and take a holy life as needless, but because they <hi>Know not</hi> what they do? Men <hi>could</hi> not go so quietly or merrily to Hell, with their <hi>eyes open,</hi> as they do when they are <hi>shut</hi> by Ignorance. Whence is it that such Multitudes are still ungodly under all the Teachings and warnings of the Lord? but because [<hi>they have their understandings darkened, being alienated from the life of God by the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart: and therefore many be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing past feeling have given them over to lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And it is for <hi>want of wisdom that they die,</hi> Prov. 10. 21. &amp; 1. 32. The ignorant are prisoners to the <hi>Prince of darkness,</hi> Eph. 6. 12. &amp; 5. 8. <hi>Knowledge is despised by none but fools,</hi> Prov. 1. 7, 22. The conquest of so many sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til <hi>enemies,</hi> the performance of so many spiritual <hi>duties,</hi> which we must go through if we will be saved, are works too hard for <hi>fools</hi> to do. The saving of a mans soul, is a work that requireth the greatest wisdom. And therefore the <hi>Illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the mind is Gods first work in the Conversion of a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <hi>Act.</hi> 26. 18. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 18. If <hi>Infinite wisdom</hi> communicate to you but the smallest beam of heavenly light, it will change your minds, and make you other men then before, and set you on another course; <hi>Wisdom</hi> will be your guide, and keep you in safe paths; It will cause you to refuse the evil, and to choose the good: It will shew you true Happiness, and the way to obtain it: It will cause you to <hi>foresee the evil,</hi> and escape it, <hi>when fools go on</hi> and are <hi>destroyed,</hi> Prov. 22. 3. <hi>Wisdom</hi> will teach
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:59347:43"/>
you to know the season, and <hi>Redeem your Time,</hi> and <hi>walk ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly,</hi> when folly will leave you to too late repentance, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 15. There is not a soul in Hell but was brought thither by <hi>sinful folly;</hi> Nor is there a soul in Heaven (of them at age) but by <hi>heavenly wisdom</hi> was conducted thither. In worldly mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters the wicked may seem wisest; and many a Saint may be very ignorant: But when you see the end, you will all consess that those were the wise men that had wisdom to repell tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations, and to refuse the entising baits of sin, and to make sure of everlasting Joyes.</p>
                     <p>O therefore apply your hearts to Wisdom! Go to Christ for it, who is <hi>the Wisdom of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 24. and is appointed by him to be <hi>our Wisdom,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 30. <hi>He</hi> will <hi>teach</hi> it you, who is the best Master in the world, so you will but keep in his School, that is his Church, and will humbly learn as little Children, and apply your selves submissively to his spirit, word and Ministers: <hi>Ask Wisdom of God, that giveth liberal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and upbraideth not</hi> with former ignorance, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 5. Think not any pains in holy means too much to get it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. [<hi>If thou wilt receive the words of God, and hide his Commandments with thee, and encline thy heart to wisdom, and apply it to understanding; yea if thou cryest after Knowledge, and liftest up thy voice for understanding; if thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as for hid treasures, then shalt thou understand the fear of the Lord, and find the knowledge of God; For the Lord giveth wisdom; out of his mouth is Knowledge and understanding.</hi>] And fear not being a loser by thy cost or labour. For [<hi>Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth undestanding: For the merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise of it is better then silver, and the gain thereof then of fine gold: she is more precious then Rubies, and all the things thou canst desire, are not to be compared to her; Her wayes are wayes of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace</hi>—] Prov. 3. 13. to 18.</p>
                     <p>2 The <hi>Infinite Wisdom</hi> of God, must resolve you to take him for your <hi>principal Teacher, Counseller and director</hi> in all your undertakings.

And do you think that any of them all, is as <hi>wise as God?</hi> It is the constant course of a <hi>worldly man</hi> to advise with the <hi>world,</hi> and of <hi>carnal men</hi> to advise with the <hi>flesh;</hi> and therefore it is that they are hurried to perdition. The <hi>flesh</hi> is <hi>brutish,</hi> and will lead you to a <hi>brutish</hi> life, and <hi>if you live after it,</hi> undoubtedly <hi>you shall die,</hi> Rom. 8. 13. and <hi>if you sow to it, you shall but reap Corruption,</hi> Gal. 6. 6, 7.

If at any time you be at a loss; and your carnal friends, or your commodity, or pleasure adviseth you one way, and the Word of God, and his faithful Ministers advise you another way, use but your Reason well, and consider whether God or those that contradict him be the wiser, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly suit your practice.

If you be but sick, its too to one but the Counsel of <hi>your Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and of <hi>your Appetite</hi> will differ. And if you will obey your <hi>Physition</hi> before your <hi>Appetite,</hi> for your <hi>health</hi> or <hi>life,</hi> should you not obey <hi>God</hi> before it for your <hi>Salvation?</hi> Do you think in your Consciences that any that perswade you to a careless worldly fleshly life, are as <hi>Wise</hi> as <hi>God</hi> that perswadeth you to the contrary? you dare not say so with your tongues? and yet the most dare say so with their lives. O how justly do the ungodly perish, that deliberately choose a <hi>brutish appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite,</hi> a <hi>malignant world,</hi> and a <hi>malicious Devil,</hi> as a <hi>wiser</hi> or <hi>fitter</hi> conducter then the <hi>Lord!</hi> But <hi>blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, but his delight is in the Law of the Lord,</hi> Psal. 1. 1, 2.

                     <p>3. The <hi>Infinite Wisdome</hi> of God, must resolve the soul to <hi>Rest in his determinations.</hi> We are most certain that God is not deceived. Though all men seem <hi>Lyers</hi> to you, let <hi>God be true:</hi> for <hi>it is impossible for him to lye,</hi> Heb. 6. 18. If <hi>our Reason</hi> be to seek, so is not <hi>God.</hi> When we are saying with <hi>Nicode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, How can these things be? God</hi> knoweth <hi>how:</hi> and it is enough for us to know that they <hi>are so.</hi> If <hi>Infinite wisdome</hi> say the word, <hi>Believe it,</hi> though all the world contradict it. Though proud unbelievers say, that the words of God are <hi>improbable,</hi> let them know that God is not at a loss when ever mens dark understandings are at a loss: The Sun is not taken out of the firmament, when ever a man closeth or loseth his eyes. What? will those cavillers puzzle the Almighty! will they pose <hi>Omniscience?</hi> Doth it follow that the course of the Planets, and the Heavens, and all the Creatures are out of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if these silly Moles <hi>understand not</hi> the order of them? No more will it follow that any <hi>word of God is false,</hi> or any <hi>Rule of God is crooked,</hi> because they see not its <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>rectitude.</hi> Shall dust and ashes judge the Lord? <hi>who hath been his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seller?</hi> and with whom hath he advised for the making, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming or governing of the world? There is no <hi>Rest</hi> to an <hi>inquisitive</hi> soul but in the <hi>Infinite wisdome</hi> of the Lord. Find once that it is <hi>his word,</hi> and enquire no further. Its madness to demand a further proof. As all <hi>Goodness</hi> is comprized in his <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Love;</hi> so all <hi>Truth</hi> is comprized in his <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Revelations.</hi> There <hi>are</hi> no Arguments but what are <hi>lower</hi> and <hi>subordinate</hi> to this. And therefore if thy <hi>Reason</hi> be at a

loss, as to the <hi>cause</hi> or <hi>manner,</hi> yet hast thou the greatest Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to believe that all is <hi>just</hi> and <hi>true</hi> that proceedeth from the <hi>Wisdom</hi> of the Lord. I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>4. And thats the next effect that Gods <hi>Omniscience</hi> should have upon our minds. <hi>Take all the sayings of men as folly that are against the Lord.</hi> Let them be high or low, learned or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned if they contradict the God of <hi>Infinite wisdome,</hi> take it but as the words of a distracted man. Did you ever meet with any man of them, that durst say he was <hi>wiser than God himself? Herod</hi> that was eaten to death with vermine, was applauded by the flattering crowd, but with this acclamation, <hi>It is the voice of a God, and not of a man,</hi> Act. 12. 22. And will you say of any man that he is <hi>wiser than God?</hi> If you dare not <hi>say</hi> so, how dare you hear them and believe them against the Word of God? How dare you be drawn from a holy life, or from a selfdenying duty, or from the truth of God, by the words of a man, yea perhaps of a very sot, that speaks against the Word of God! <hi>To the Law, and to the Testimony: if they speak not according to these, it is because there is no Light in them,</hi> Isa. 8. 20.]</p>
                     <p>5. The <hi>Infinite wisdom of God,</hi> should <hi>establish</hi> our <hi>confidence</hi> concerning the <hi>fulfilling</hi> of all his <hi>Word.</hi> He will not fail for want of <hi>Knowledge:</hi> when he spoke that <hi>Prophesie,</hi> that <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise</hi> or that <hi>Threatning,</hi> he <hi>perfectly knew</hi> all things that would come to pass, to all eternity. He knew therefore what he said when he gave out his Word, and therefore will fulfill it. <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth may pass away, but one Iota or tittle of his word shall not pass away till all be accomplished,</hi> Mat. 5. 18</p>
                     <p>6. And from the <hi>Infinite wisdom of God,</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> must be <hi>encouraged</hi> in <hi>its greatest straits,</hi> and against all the <hi>cunning subtilty</hi> of <hi>their enemies.</hi> Are we ever in such straits, that <hi>God knows not</hi> how to bring us out? when <hi>we</hi> see no way for our deliverance, doth it follow that <hi>he sees</hi> none? If cunning Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents are too subtle <hi>for us,</hi> do we think that they can <hi>overwit the Lord?</hi> what had become of us long ago, if God had <hi>not known</hi> what ever is plotted at <hi>Rome,</hi> or <hi>Spain,</hi> or Hell against us? If he knoweth not of all the consultations of the conclave, and of all the contrivances of Jesuits and Fryers; and of all

the juglings of the masked Emissaries; If God had not known of <hi>Vaux</hi> and his Powder mine, it might have blown up all our hopes. But while we know that God is in their Councils, and heareth every word they say, and knoweth every secret of their hearts, and every mischief which they enterprise, let us do our duty, and rest in the <hi>wisdom</hi> of our great Protector, who will prove all his adversaries to have plaid the fools: For as sure as his <hi>Omnipstency</hi> shall be glorified by overtopping all <hi>opposing powers,</hi> so sure shall his <hi>Infinite wisdom</hi> be glorified, by conquering and befooling the <hi>wisdom</hi> that is against him.</p>
                     <p>7. Lstly, if God be <hi>Infinite in Knowledge,</hi> it must resolve us all to <hi>live accordingly.</hi> O Remember what ever thou <hi>Thinkest,</hi> that God is acquainted with all thy <hi>Thoughts.</hi> And wilt thou feed on lustful, or covetous, or malicious, or unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Thoughts, in the eye of God? Remember in thy prayers and every duty, that he knows the very frame of all thy affections, and the <hi>manner</hi> as well as the <hi>matter</hi> of thy ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices. And wilt thou be cold and careless in the sight of God? O Remember in thy <hi>secretst sins,</hi> and thy works of darkness, that nothing is <hi>unknown</hi> to God; and that before him thou art in the open light. And fearest thou not the face of the Almighty? Wilt thou do that when <hi>he knoweth it,</hi> that thou wouldst not do if <hi>man</hi> did know? <hi>He knows</hi> whether thou deceive thy neighbour, or deal uprightly! <hi>Defraud</hi> not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; for <hi>the Lord is the avenger,</hi> 1 Thes. 4. 6. Do nothing that thou wouldst not have <hi>God to know.</hi> For certainly <hi>he knoweth</hi> all things. Shall <hi>he</hi> not <hi>see</hi> that made and illuminateth the eye? and shall <hi>he</hi> not hear that made both tongue and ears? and shall <hi>he</hi> not know that giveth us understanding, and by whom we know? <hi>Psal.</hi> 94. 8, 9, 10.</p>
                     <p>And let this be thy <hi>comfort</hi> in thy <hi>secret duties.</hi> He that <hi>knoweth</hi> thy <hi>Heart,</hi> will not overlook the <hi>desires</hi> of thy <hi>Heart,</hi> though thou hadst not words as thou desirest to express them.

                     <p>8. THE next of Gods Attributes that must make its Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press on the soul, is <hi>Hit Infinite Goodness.</hi> The Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of <hi>Goodness</hi> (as all other his Attributes) is fetcht from, and suited to the capacity or affections of the soul of man. That which is truly <hi>Amiable</hi> is called <hi>Good.</hi> Not as if there were <hi>no Goodness,</hi> but what is <hi>a means to mans felicity,</hi> as some most sottishly have affirmed: For <hi>our End</hi> and <hi>Felicity it self,</hi> and <hi>God</hi> as he is <hi>Perfect</hi> and <hi>Excellent in himself,</hi> is <hi>more amiable</hi> then all <hi>means.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In three respects therefore it is that God is called <hi>Good,</hi> or <hi>Amiable</hi> to man. 1. In that he is <hi>Infinitely Excellent and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in Himself.</hi> For the <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>Friendship</hi> is a <hi>higher Love</hi> then that of <hi>Desire.</hi> And the most perfect sort of <hi>Love,</hi> is that which wholly carrieth the Lover from himself <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>to the perfect object of his Love. The soul <hi>Delighteth</hi> to contemplate <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency,</hi> when the <hi>excellency it self</hi> and not the <hi>delight,</hi> is the <hi>ultimate end</hi> of that <hi>desire</hi> and <hi>contemplation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. God is called <hi>Good</hi> as he is <hi>the Pattern and Fountain of all Moral Good.</hi> As he maketh us <hi>Righteous Holy Laws,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding Moral Good, and forbidding and condemning evil. And thus his <hi>Goodness</hi> is his <hi>Holiness</hi> and <hi>Righteousness,</hi> his <hi>Faithfulness</hi> and <hi>Truth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. God is called <hi>Good,</hi> as he is the <hi>Fountain of all the Creatures
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:59347:47"/>
happiness,</hi> and as he is <hi>bountiful and gracious</hi> and ready to <hi>do good,</hi> and as he is the <hi>felicitating end and object</hi> of the soul.</p>
                     <p>And this Infinite <hi>goodness</hi> must have these effects upon us. 1. It must <hi>possess us with a superlative Love to God.</hi> This blessed Attribute is it that makes us <hi>Saints indeed,</hi> and maketh that <hi>Impression</hi> on us, which is as the <hi>Heart</hi> of the <hi>New Creature.</hi> It is <hi>Goodness</hi> that produceth <hi>Love.</hi> And <hi>Love</hi> is that Grace that closeth with God as <hi>our Happiness and End,</hi> and is the <hi>felicitating enjoying</hi> Grace. Without it we are but <hi>as sounding brass,</hi> or <hi>tinkling Cymbals,</hi> whatever our gifts and parts may be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. <hi>Love</hi> is the very <hi>excellency</hi> of the soul, as it closeth with the <hi>infinite excellency</hi> of God. It is the very <hi>feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city</hi> of the soul, as it <hi>enjoyeth him</hi> that is our <hi>felicity.</hi> Most certainly the <hi>prevailing Love of God,</hi> is the <hi>surest evidence</hi> of true sanctification. He that hath <hi>most Love,</hi> hath <hi>most Grace;</hi> and is the <hi>best</hi> and <hi>strongest</hi> Christian: and he that hath <hi>least Love,</hi> is the <hi>worst</hi> or <hi>weakest. Knowledge</hi> and <hi>faith</hi> are but to work our hearts to <hi>Love;</hi> and when <hi>Love</hi> is perfect they have done their work, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 31. and 13. 8, 9, 10, 13. <hi>Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and distant Revelations will not be for ever; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore such <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Faith</hi> as we have now, will not be for ever. But <hi>God</hi> will be for <hi>ever Amiable to us,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Love</hi> will endure for ever. The <hi>goodness</hi> of God is called <hi>Love,</hi> and as <hi>God is Love,</hi> so <hi>he that dwelleth in Love doth dwell in God,</hi> and <hi>God in him,</hi> 1 Joh. 4. 16. The knowledge of Divine <hi>goodness</hi> makes us <hi>good,</hi> because it maketh us <hi>Love him</hi> that is <hi>good.</hi> It is <hi>Love</hi> that acteth most <hi>purely</hi> for God. <hi>Fear is selfish,</hi> and hath somewhat of <hi>aversation.</hi> Though there be no <hi>evil</hi> in <hi>God</hi> for us to <hi>fear,</hi> yet is there <hi>such good</hi> in him that will <hi>bring the evil of punishment</hi> upon the <hi>evil;</hi> and <hi>this</hi> they fear. But <hi>Love</hi> doth resign the soul to God, and that in the most congruous acceptable manner. Make it therefore your daily work to possess your souls with the <hi>Love of God. Love him</hi> once, and all that he saith and doth will be more <hi>acceptable to you:</hi> and all that <hi>you</hi> say or do in <hi>Love,</hi> will be more <hi>acceptable unto him. Love him</hi> and you will be loth to offend him: you will be desirous to please him: you will be satisfied in his Love. <hi>Love him</hi> and you may be <hi>sure</hi> that <hi>he Loveth you. Love is the fulfilling of his Law,</hi> Rom. 13. 10. And that you
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:59347:47"/>
may <hi>Love</hi> him, this must be your work to <hi>Believe</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template his goodness.</hi> Consider daily of the <hi>Infinite goodness</hi> or <hi>Amiableness</hi> of his <hi>Nature,</hi> and of his <hi>excellency</hi> appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his <hi>works,</hi> and of the perfect <hi>Holiness</hi> of his <hi>Laws.</hi> But especially see him in the face of <hi>Christ,</hi> and behold his <hi>Love</hi> in the design of our Redemption, in the <hi>person</hi> of the <hi>Redeemer,</hi> and in the <hi>promises</hi> of Grace, and in all the <hi>benefits<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> of Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption. Yea look by <hi>Faith</hi> to <hi>Heaven</hi> it self, and think how you must for ever live in the perfect blessed Love of infinite <hi>enjoyed goodness.</hi> As it is the <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>sight</hi> of <hi>gold,</hi> or <hi>beauty,</hi> or any other earthly vanity that kindleth the <hi>Love of them</hi> in the minds of men; so is it the <hi>knowledge</hi> and serious contemplation of the <hi>goodness of God</hi> that must make us <hi>Love him,</hi> if ever we will <hi>Love him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. The <hi>goodness of God</hi> must also <hi>encourage the soul to trust him.</hi> For <hi>Infinite good</hi> will not deceive us. Nor can we fear any <hi>hurt</hi> from him, but what we wilfully bring upon our selves. If I knew but which were the <hi>best</hi> and <hi>most Loving</hi> man in the world, I could <hi>trust</hi> him above <hi>all men;</hi> and I should not fear any <hi>injury</hi> from him. How many friends have I that I <hi>dare trust</hi> with my <hi>estate</hi> and <hi>life,</hi> because I <hi>know</hi> that they have <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>goodness</hi> in their low degree! And shall I not <hi>trust</hi> the <hi>Blessed God,</hi> that is <hi>Love it self</hi> and <hi>Infinitely good?</hi> what ever he will be in <hi>Justice</hi> to the <hi>ungodly,</hi> I am sure he <hi>delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not in the death of sinners, but rather that they turn and live;</hi> and that he will not cast off the soul that <hi>Loveth him,</hi> and would fain be fully conformed to his will. It cannot be that he should spurn at them that are humbled at his feet, and long, and pray, and seek, and mourn after nothing more then his <hi>grace and love!</hi> Think not of God as if he were scanter of <hi>love and goodness,</hi> then the <hi>Creature</hi> is: If you have high and confident thoughts of the <hi>goodness</hi> and <hi>fidelity</hi> of <hi>any man</hi> on earth, and dare quietly <hi>trust him</hi> with your life and all; see that you have much higher thoughts of <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>trust him</hi> with greater confidence, left you set him below the silly creature in the Attributes of his <hi>goodness,</hi> which his Glory and your Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness require you to know.</p>
                     <p>3. The <hi>Infinite goodness of God,</hi> must <hi>call off our hearts from the inordinate Love of all created good whatever.</hi> Who would
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:59347:48"/>
stoop so low as <hi>earth,</hi> that may converse with God? And who would feed on such poor delights that hath tasted the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of the Lord? Nothing more sure then that the <hi>Love of God</hi> doth not reign in that soul, where the <hi>Love of the world,</hi> or of <hi>fleshly lust,</hi> or pleasure reigneth, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 15. Had worldlings, or sensual, or ambitious men, but truly <hi>known</hi> the <hi>goodness</hi> of the Lord, they could never have so fallen in <hi>Love</hi> with those deceitful vanities. If we could but open their eyes to see the <hi>Loveliness</hi> of their Redeemer, they would soon be weaned from <hi>other Loves.</hi> Would you conquer the <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>Riches,</hi> or <hi>Honour,</hi> or any thing else that corrupteth your affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions? O try this sure and powerful way! Draw nigh to <hi>God,</hi> and take the fullest view thou canst, in thy most serious Meditation of <hi>his Infinite goodness,</hi> and all things else will be <hi>vile</hi> in thy esteem, and thy heart will soon contemn them and forget them, and thou wilt never dote upon them more.</p>
                     <p>4. The <hi>Infinite goodness</hi> of God, should <hi>increase Repentance, and win the soul to a more resolute chearful service of the Lord.</hi> O what a heart is that which can <hi>offend,</hi> and wilfully offend so <hi>good a God! This</hi> is the <hi>odiousness of sin,</hi> that it is an abuse of an <hi>Infinite good.</hi> This is the most hainous damning aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, that <hi>Infinite goodness</hi> could not prevail with wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed souls against the empty flattering world! but that they suffered a dream and shadow, to weigh down <hi>Infinite goodness</hi> in their esteem. And is it possible for worse then this to be found in man? He that had rather the <hi>sun</hi> were out of the firmament, then a hair were taken off his head, were unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to see the light of the Sun. And surely he that will turn away from <hi>God himself</hi> to enjoy the <hi>pleasures</hi> of his <hi>flesh,</hi> is unworthy to <hi>enjoy the Lord.</hi> Its bad enough that <hi>Augustine</hi> in one of his Epistles saith of sottish worldly men, that <hi>they had rather there were two stars fewer in the firmament, then one Cow fewer in their Pastures, or one tree fewer in their woods or grounds.</hi> But it is ten thousand times a greater evil that every wicked man is guilty of, that will rather <hi>forsake the Living God,</hi> and lose his part in <hi>Infinite goodness,</hi> then he will let go his filthy and unprofitable sins: O Sinners, as you love your souls, <hi>despise not the riches of the goodness, and forbearance, and long suffering of the Lord; but know that his goodness should lead you
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:59347:48"/>
to Repentance,</hi> Rom. 2. 4. Would you spit at the Sun? Would you revile the stars? Would you curse the holy Angels? If not, O do not ten thousand fold worse, by your wilful sinning against the Infinite Goodness it self.</p>
                     <p>But for you Christians that have seen the <hi>Amiableness</hi> of the Lord, and tasted of his <hi>perfect Goodness,</hi> let this be enough to melt your hearts, that ever you have wilfully sin'd against him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> O what a Good did you contemn in the dayes of your unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generacy, and in the hour of your sin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Be not so ingrateful and disingenuous as to do so again. Remember when ever a Temptation comes, that it would entice you from the <hi>Infinite Good;</hi> Ask the tempter, man or Devil, Whether he hath more then an <hi>Infinite Good</hi> to offer you; and whether he can outbid the Lord for your affection.</p>
                     <p>And now for the time that is before you, how cheerfully should you address your selves unto his service! and how de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfully should you follow it on from day to day! What manner of persons should the servants of <hi>this God</hi> be, that are called to nothing but what is <hi>Good!</hi> How <hi>Good</hi> a Master! how <hi>good</hi> a work! and how <hi>good</hi> company, encouragements and helps! and how <hi>good</hi> an End! All is <hi>good,</hi> because it is the <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Good,</hi> that we serve and seek. And shall we be loitering unprofitable servants!</p>
                     <p>5. Moreover this <hi>Infinite Goodness</hi> should be the matter of our <hi>daily Praises.</hi> He that cannot cheerfully magnifie <hi>this</hi> At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute of God, so <hi>suitable</hi> to the nature of the <hi>Will,</hi> is surely a stranger to the Praises of the Lord. The <hi>Goodness of God</hi> should be a <hi>daily feast</hi> to a gracious soul, and should conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually feed our cheerful Praises, as the spring or cistern fills the Pipes. I know no sweeter work on earth, nay I am sure <hi>there is</hi> no sweeter, then for faithful sanctified souls, rejoicing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to magnifie the <hi>Goodness of the Lord,</hi> and joyn together in his cheerful Praises. O Christians, if you would tast the Joys of Saints, and live like the redeemed of the Lord indeed, be much in the exercise of this Heavenly work, and with holy <hi>David,</hi> make it your employment, and say [<hi>O how great is thy Goodness which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee!</hi> Psal. 31. 19.] <hi>The earth is full of the goodness of the Lord,</hi> Psal. 33. 5.] What then are the Heavens?

And if there be a pleasant <hi>hour</hi> for man on earth to spend, and a delightful work for man to do, it is to meditate on, and with the Saints to Praise the Infinite goodness of the Lord.

                     </p>
                     <p>6. Moreover, the <hi>Goodness of God,</hi> must possess us with <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire</hi> to be <hi>conformed to his goodness</hi> in our measure. The <hi>Holy</hi> perfection of his <hi>Will,</hi> must make us desire to have our Wills conformed to the <hi>will</hi> of God; We are not called to Imitate him in his works of <hi>Power,</hi> nor so much in the paths of his <hi>Omniscience,</hi> as we are in his <hi>goodness,</hi> which as manifested in his <hi>work,</hi> and <hi>word,</hi> is the Pattern and standard of <hi>Moral Goodness</hi> in the sons of men. The <hi>Impress</hi> of his <hi>goodness</hi> within us, is the chief part of his <hi>Image</hi> on us; and the fruits of it in our <hi>Lives</hi> is their <hi>Holiness</hi> and <hi>Vertue.</hi> As he <hi>is Good and doth Good,</hi> Psal. 119. 68. so must it be our greatest care to <hi>be</hi> as <hi>good</hi> and <hi>do</hi> as much <hi>good</hi> as possibly we can. Any thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us that is sinful and contrary to the <hi>Goodness</hi> of God, should be to our souls as griping poyson to our bodies, which nature is excited to strive against with all its strength, and can have no safety or rest till it be cast out. And for <hi>Doing Good,</hi> it must be the very study and trade of our lives. As <hi>world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings</hi> study and labour for the <hi>world,</hi> and the Pleasing of their flesh; so must the <hi>Christian</hi> study and labour to improve his masters talents to his use, and to do as much good as he is able, and to please the Lord. Prov. 11. 23. [<hi>The desire of the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous</hi> (as such) <hi>is only Good] To depart from evil and do good,</hi> is the care of the just, Psal. 34. 14. <hi>We must please our neighbours for Good to their Edification,</hi> Rom. 15. 2. <hi>While we have time we must do good to all men</hi> (as we are able) <hi>but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to them of the houshold of faith,</hi> Gal. 6. 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>] Not only to them that <hi>do good to us,</hi> but to <hi>our enemies,</hi> Luk. 6. 32, 33, 34.

                        <pb n="72" facs="tcp:59347:50"/>7. From the perfect <hi>Infinite goodness of God,</hi> we must learn to <hi>judge of Good and Evil, and in all the Creatures.</hi> To this must all be reduced as the standard, and by this must they be tryed. It is a most wretched absurdity of sensual men, to try the <hi>will,</hi> or <hi>word,</hi> or <hi>wayes</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> by <hi>themselves,</hi> and by <hi>their own interests</hi> or <hi>wills;</hi> and to judge all to be <hi>Evil</hi> in God that is <hi>against them.</hi> And yet, alas, how common is this case! Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man is naturally <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And thus if the <hi>Thief</hi> or <hi>Murderer</hi> had the choise of <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Judges,</hi> you may know what persons he would choose; No one should be a <hi>Judge,</hi> or accounted a <hi>good man,</hi> that would condemn and hang him.</p>
                     <p>But I beseech you consider, what is sit to be the Rule and standard, if not <hi>perfection of Goodness</hi> it self. Do you think that the <hi>Will</hi> of ignorant, fleshly, sinful man, is fitter to be the <hi>Rule of Goodness,</hi> then the <hi>Will of God?</hi> We are <hi>sure that God</hi> is not deceived, and <hi>sure</hi> that there is no iniquity with him; but we know that all <hi>men</hi> are lyable to deceit, and have private interests, and corrupted minds, and wills that have some vicious inclinations. O what Blaspheamy is in the heart of that man, that will sooner condemn the holy Will and Law of God, then his own Will, or the Wills of any men, be they never so seemingly wise or great! The will of God is revealed in his Laws, concerning the necessity of a holy life; and the will of foolish wicked men is by their scornful speeches and sinful lives revealed to be against it. And which of these do you follow? which is it that prescribeth you the better course? the will of God that is <hi>infinitely good,</hi> or the will of man
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:59347:50"/>
that is miserably evil? If thou know any <hi>Better</hi> then God, follow him before God. But if none be <hi>Greater</hi> and more <hi>Powerful</hi> then he, if none be <hi>Wiser</hi> or of more <hi>Knowledge,</hi> it is as sure that none is <hi>Better.</hi> Much less are <hi>those ignorant wicked men,</hi> that despise the Scripture and a holy life, and would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade you that they can tell you of a Better way. Let me speak it to the terrour of the ungodly soul, that by the deceits or scorns of any sort of men, is drawn away from Christ and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; It shall stand on record against thee until judgement, and it shall stick everlastingly as a dagger in thy heart, that thou didst prefer the <hi>Reasons</hi> and the <hi>Will</hi> of <hi>man,</hi> yea perhaps of a <hi>sottish drunkard</hi> or a <hi>worldling,</hi> before the <hi>word</hi> or <hi>Will of God:</hi> And though thy tongue durst not speak it, thy life did speak it, that thou thoughtest the word and will of man to be Better then the word and will of God: Yea more, that thou tookest the way of the <hi>Devil,</hi> to be <hi>better</hi> then <hi>Gods</hi> wayes, who is <hi>infinitely good:</hi> For surely thou <hi>choosest</hi> that which thou takest to <hi>be best for thee.</hi> And therefore if that man deserve damnation, that sets up a <hi>man,</hi> or a <hi>horse,</hi> or an <hi>image,</hi> and saith [<hi>This is greater and wiser then God, and therefore this shall be my God</hi>] then dost thou deserve the same damnation, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And all is naught and will prove so in the end, that is against this will of God, what policy or good soever may be pretended for it.</p>
                     <p>8. And if the <hi>will of God</hi> be <hi>Infinitely Good,</hi> we must all labour both to <hi>understand</hi> it, and <hi>perform</hi> it. Many say, <hi>Who will shew us any Good,</hi> Psal. 4. 6. Would you not know what is <hi>Best,</hi> that you may <hi>choose</hi> and <hi>seek</hi> it? As the inordinate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of <hi>Knowing natural Good</hi> and <hi>Evil</hi> did cause our misery,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:59347:51"/>
so the holy rectified desires of <hi>Knowing spiritual Good,</hi> must recover us; search the Scriptures then, and study and enquire; for it more concerns you to know the <hi>Will of God,</hi> then to know the will of your <hi>Princes</hi> or <hi>benefactors,</hi> or to know of any treasures of the world; The <hi>Riches of Grace</hi> are given to us, by Gods <hi>making known the mystery of his will, according to his Good pleasure which he purposed in himself,</hi> Eph. 1. 7, 9. And our desire to know the Good will of God, must be that we may <hi>Do</hi> it. For this must we pray, Col. 1. 9. 10. <hi>That we may be filled with the knowledge of his will, in all wisdom and spiritual understanding, that we may walk worthy of the Lord, unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work</hi>] that we may [<hi>be made perfect in every good work to do his will, and have that wrought in us which is pleasing in his sight,</hi> Heb. 13. 21.] that we may not only <hi>know his will and approve the things that are excellent,</hi> Rom. 2. 18. but may <hi>prepare our selves to do according to his Will,</hi> lest we be punished the more; <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 47. See that the will of no man be preferred before Gods will; seck not your <hi>own</hi> Wills, nor set them up against the Lords: If Christ whose will was pure and holy, profess that he sought not <hi>his own will, but his Fathers,</hi> Joh. 5. 30. and that he <hi>came not to do his own will, but his that sent him,</hi> Joh. 6. 38. should it not be our resolution, whose wills are so misguided and corrupt?</p>
                     <p>9. If Gods will be <hi>Infinitely Good,</hi> we must <hi>Rest in his Will;</hi> when his wayes are dark, or grievous to our flesh: when his word seems difficult; when we know not what he is doing with us, remember it is the <hi>Will</hi> that is <hi>Infinitely Good,</hi> that is disposing of us. Only let us see that we stand not cross to the <hi>greater Good</hi> of his Church, and honour; and then we may be sure that he will not be against <hi>our Good.</hi> We that can <hi>Rest</hi> in the will of a dear and faithful friend, should much more <hi>Rest</hi> in the <hi>Will of God;</hi> Do your <hi>duty,</hi> and be <hi>not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is</hi> for you to do, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 17. and then distract not your minds with distrustful fears about his will that is infinitely Good, but say, <hi>The Will of the Lord be done,</hi> Act. 21. 14.</p>
                     <p>10. The <hi>Infinite Goodness</hi> of God, should draw out our hearts to <hi>desire communion with him,</hi> and <hi>to long after the

Are your houses, or lands, or friends, or pleasures, or any thing better then <hi>Infinite Goodness?</hi> () meditate on this blessed Attribute of God, till you distast the world, till you are angry with your withdrawing murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing flesh, till you are ashamed of your unwillingness to be with God, and till you can calmly look in the face of death, and contentedly hear the message that is posting towards you, that you must presently come away to God.

                     <p>9. HAving spoken of these three great <hi>Attributes</hi> of God, I must needs speak of those <hi>three great Relations</hi> of God to man, and of these <hi>three works</hi> in which they are founded, which have flowed from these Attributes.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>one God in three Persons,</hi> hath <hi>Created</hi> man and all things which before were not; hath <hi>Redeemed</hi> man when he was lost by sin; and <hi>sanctifieth</hi> those that shall be saved by Redemption. Though the external works of the Trinity are <hi>undivided,</hi> yet not <hi>indistinct</hi> as to the order of working, and a special interest that each person hath in each of these works. The <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> did create the world; and they also did Redeem us, and do Sanctifie us. But so as that <hi>Creation</hi> is in a special sort ascribed to the <hi>Father, Redemption</hi> to the <hi>Son,</hi> and <hi>Sanctification</hi> to the <hi>Holy Spirit;</hi> Not only because of the <hi>order</hi> of <hi>operation,</hi> agreeable to the <hi>order</hi> of <hi>subsisting;</hi> for then the <hi>Father</hi> would be as properly said to be <hi>incarnate</hi> or to <hi>die</hi> for us, or <hi>mediate,</hi> as the Son to <hi>create</hi> us; (which is not to be said;) For he created the world by his Word, or Son and Spirit (<hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>Psal.</hi> 33. 6.) and he Redeemed it by his Son, and Sanctifieth it by his Spirit. But Scripture assureth us that the <hi>Son alone</hi> was <hi>incarnate</hi> for us, and <hi>dyed</hi> and <hi>Rose</hi> again, and not the <hi>Father,</hi> or the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and so that the humane nature is peculiarly united to the second person, in glory; and so that each person hath a peculiar in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in these several works, the Reason of which is much above our reach.</p>
                     <p>The first of these <hi>Relations</hi> of God to man, which we are to consider of, is, that he is our <hi>Creator;</hi> It is he that <hi>giveth Being</hi> to us and all things; and that giveth us all our <hi>faculties</hi> or <hi>Powers.</hi> Under this, for brevity, we shall speak of him also as he is our <hi>Preserver;</hi> because <hi>preservation,</hi> is but a kind of continued <hi>Creation,</hi> or a continuance of the <hi>Beings</hi> which God hath caused. God then is <hi>the first efficient cause</hi> of all the <hi>creatures</hi> from the greatest to the least, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. And easily

did he make them, for <hi>he spake</hi> but <hi>the word, and they were created:</hi> They are the Products of <hi>his Power, Wisdome</hi> and <hi>Goodness.</hi> Psal. 33. 6. Joh. 1. 3.

                     <p>1. If <hi>All things be from God as the Creater and Preserver,</hi> then we must be deeply possessed with this truth, that <hi>All things are for God as their ultimate end.</hi> For he that is the <hi>Beginning</hi> and <hi>first cause of all</hi> things, must needs be the <hi>End of all.</hi> His <hi>Will</hi> produced them, and the <hi>Pleasure of his Will</hi> is the <hi>End</hi> for which he did produce them. <hi>Isa.</hi> 43. 7. <hi>I have created him for my glory</hi>] Prov. 16. 4. <hi>The Lord hath made all things for himself, yea even the wicked for the day of evil</hi>] I think the Chaldee Paraphrase, the Syriack and Arabick give us the true meaning of this, who concordantly translate it, [<hi>The wicked is kept for the day of evil</hi>] as <hi>Job</hi> hath it, 21. 30. <hi>The wicked is reserved to the day of destruction; they shall be brought forth to the day of wrath.</hi> And 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 9. [<hi>To reserve the unjust to the day of judgement to be punished</hi>] God <hi>made not</hi> the <hi>wicked as wicked,</hi> or <hi>to be wicked;</hi> but he that gave them their <hi>Being</hi> and continueth it, will not be a loser by his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or preservation, but will have the glory of his Justice by them in the day of wrath or evil, for which he <hi>keeps them,</hi> and till which he beareth with them, because they would not obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diently give him the glory of his <hi>Holiness and mercy.</hi> So it is said of Christ, <hi>Col.</hi> 16, 17. <hi>For by him were all things created that are in Heaven and that are in earth, visible and invisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble—all things were created By him and For him. If they are By him, they must</hi> needs be <hi>For him.</hi> So <hi>Rev.</hi> 4. 11. <hi>Thou art worthy O Lord, to receive Glory, and Honour, and Power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created</hi>] This <hi>Pleasure</hi> of <hi>Gods will</hi> is the <hi>End</hi> of all things: and therefore it is certain that he will see that all things shall accomplish <hi>that end,</hi> and <hi>his will</hi> shall be <hi>pleased. Rom.</hi> 11. 36. we have all in few words [<hi>For of him, and through him, and to him are all things, and to whom be glory for ever,

                     </p>
                     <p>I answer; Understand but how his will is <hi>crossed</hi> or <hi>accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished, pleased</hi> or <hi>displeased,</hi> and you will see, that his <hi>will</hi> is <hi>alwayes done</hi> and <hi>pleased,</hi> even by them that <hi>displease him</hi> in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

And as God as our <hi>Governour</hi> doth by his <hi>Laws</hi> oblige man to his <hi>Duty,</hi> his will hath its effect: A <hi>Command</hi> doth but make the thing commanded to be <hi>our Duty;</hi> and <hi>our Duty</hi> it is: and so <hi>this act</hi> of the <hi>will of God</hi> is not in vain. <hi>Thus far</hi> he hath his <hi>will.</hi> By his <hi>Promises</hi> he maketh the <hi>Reward to be Due</hi> to all on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition they perform the <hi>Duty,</hi> on which he hath suspended it, and to be <hi>Actually Due</hi> to those only that perform the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And all this is accomplished. Heaven is <hi>Conditionally</hi> given to <hi>all,</hi> and <hi>Actually</hi> to the <hi>Faithful only.</hi> So that what God <hi>willeth</hi> to be <hi>Due</hi> as a Lawgiver, <hi>is</hi> accordingly <hi>Due;</hi> and what he <hi>actually willeth</hi> shall <hi>come to pass,</hi> shall <hi>come to pass</hi> according to his <hi>will.</hi>

                     <p>But perhaps you will say, <hi>He doth not will that all men shall Eventually obey his Laws, but only that it shall be their Duty.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I answer, Our speeches of God being borrowed from <hi>man,</hi> (who is one of the <hi>Glasses</hi> in which he is here seen by us; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the <hi>manhood of Jesus Christ</hi>) We must accordingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:59347:53"/>
and say (acknowledging still the improprieties and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections of our conceptions and expressions) that as <hi>man</hi> doth <hi>simply</hi> and most properly will the <hi>Event</hi> of <hi>some</hi> things which he absolutely desireth should come to pass, and doth <hi>not simply will</hi> some other things, but only <hi>in tantum;</hi> he <hi>so far willeth them,</hi> that he <hi>willeth</hi> and resolveth to do such and such things as have a tendency thereto, and to go no farther, and do no more for the attaining of them, though he could; so God doth <hi>simply</hi> and <hi>properly will</hi> some things, that is, the things which he <hi>Decreeth shall come to pass:</hi> but we must after our manner conceive and say, that there are <hi>other things</hi> which he <hi>willeth</hi> but <hi>in tantum, so far</hi> as to make it <hi>mans Duty</hi> to perform it, and <hi>perswade him</hi> to the doing of that duty, and give him such a <hi>measure of help</hi> as leaveth him without any just excuse, if he do it not; and <hi>so far</hi> he willeth the salvation of such, as to <hi>Promise</hi> or <hi>offer it</hi> them on such terms: and <hi>no further</hi> doth he <hi>will</hi> the obedience or salvation which <hi>never comes to pass,</hi> but leaveth it here to the <hi>will of man.</hi> For if he <hi>simply willed</hi> that every <hi>Duty</hi> should be <hi>Eventually done,</hi> it <hi>would be done:</hi> and if he <hi>simply willed</hi> that all men should be <hi>actually saved,</hi> they <hi>would be saved.</hi> And that he <hi>simply willeth</hi> their <hi>Duty</hi> or <hi>Obligation,</hi> and <hi>in tantum, so far,</hi> doth <hi>will</hi> the <hi>event</hi> of their obedience and salvation, <hi>as this comes to,</hi> as aforesaid, is certain, and in this we are all agreed; and I am not so well <hi>skild in dividing</hi> as to understand where the <hi>real difference</hi> lyeth between the parties that here most contend: But about the bare <hi>Name</hi> I know they differ, some thinking that <hi>this last</hi> is not to be <hi>Named</hi> an Act of <hi>Gods will,</hi> or a <hi>willing</hi> of mans obedience or salvation, and some thinking that <hi>it is</hi> so to be <hi>named:</hi> who doubtless are in the <hi>right;</hi> nor is there room for controversies, while we confess the <hi>impropriety</hi> of this and all our speeches of God, as speaking after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of men, and while Scripture that must teach us how to speak of God, doth frequently so speak before us.</p>
                     <p>2. God being the <hi>Maker</hi> and <hi>first Cause of all things,</hi> that is of all <hi>substantial Beings,</hi> commonly called <hi>Creatures,</hi> we must conclude that <hi>Sin</hi> is no <hi>such Being,</hi> because it is most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that he is not the <hi>Creatour</hi> or the <hi>cause</hi> of it. Scripture assureth us, and all Christians are agreed that <hi>God</hi> is not the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:59347:54"/>
                        <hi>Cause or Author of sin.</hi> How odious then should that be <hi>to us,</hi> that is so bad as not to come from God? If God disclaim it, let us disclaim it. Let us abhor that it should come from us, seeing God abhorreth that it should come from him. Own not that which hath nothing of God upon it.</p>
                     <p>If you say, <hi>that it is an Accident though not a substance, and therefore it must needs come from God; because even Accidents have their Being.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I answer, That among the subtilest Disputers it is granted, that it hath no <hi>Created Being,</hi> or no <hi>Being that is caused by God;</hi> of this they are agreed. Its granted by all Christians that sin hath no other kind of <hi>Being,</hi> but what the <hi>will of man</hi> can <hi>cause.</hi> And if that be so, the <hi>Philosophical</hi> trifling controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, <hi>whether it be only a Privation, or a Relation,</hi> or <hi>Modus Entis,</hi> which the will thus causeth, must be handled as <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical,</hi> and valued but as it deserveth: For this is all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie that here remains. If the <hi>form</hi> be <hi>Relative,</hi> and the <hi>Foundation</hi> be but a meer <hi>Prevation,</hi> (the <hi>Disconformity</hi> being founded in a <hi>defect</hi>) then the case is soon resolved, as to the rest. He that <hi>erreth, understandeth amiss:</hi> that he <hi>understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,</hi> is of <hi>God:</hi> that he <hi>erreth,</hi> that is, <hi>is defective,</hi> and so <hi>false</hi> in his understanding, is of <hi>himself:</hi> that he <hi>willeth</hi> when he chooseth sin, is of <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Universal cause:</hi> But that he <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth</hi> a <hi>forbidden object</hi> rather then the <hi>contrary,</hi> and <hi>faileth</hi> in his understanding and his will, this is <hi>not of God,</hi> but of <hi>himself.</hi> If others say, that the very <hi>Fundamentum</hi> of that Disconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity which is the Form of sin, is sometime an <hi>Act,</hi> they must also say that it is not an Act <hi>as such,</hi> but <hi>This Act comparative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> considered, or as <hi>circumstantiated,</hi> or as <hi>exercised on the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden object rather then another,</hi> or a <hi>Volition</hi> instead of a <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition,</hi> and choosing that which should be refused, or a refusing that which should be chosen: And whether this <hi>comparate specifying foundation,</hi> be a <hi>Privation,</hi> or a <hi>Mode,</hi> is a <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical controversie;</hi> and in <hi>Philosophy,</hi> and not in <hi>Theology</hi> is the difficulty; Divines being agreed as aforesaid, that what ever you Name it, <hi>Being,</hi> or <hi>Privation,</hi> or <hi>Mode,</hi> it is but such as must be resolved ultimately into the <hi>will of man</hi> as its <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal,</hi> or <hi>first cause,</hi> supposing God to be the <hi>Creator</hi> and <hi>Conserver</hi> of that <hi>free Power</hi> that is able to choose or to refuse,

and as an <hi>universal Cause</hi> to concur with the agent to the <hi>Act as such.</hi> But Philosophers indeed are at a loss, and are fain to tell us of <hi>Privations, Modes, Relations, Denominations, Entia Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis</hi> and I know not what, that they say are neither <hi>Beings</hi> nor <hi>Nothing,</hi> but between both they know not what! the <hi>nature</hi> of things, in the utmost extremities of the branches being so cap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>If you say, <hi>That the Will of God is the Cause of all things, and therefore of sin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I answer, If you call sin <hi>Nothing,</hi> as a <hi>shaddow, darkness, death,</hi> &amp;c. are <hi>nothing</hi> (for all that we abhor them) then you answer your selves; If you <hi>call</hi> it <hi>something,</hi> we are all agreed, that its but <hi>such a something</hi> as <hi>man can cause</hi> without Gods <hi>first causing it;</hi> It sufficeth that God do the part of a <hi>Creatour</hi> in <hi>giving</hi> man the <hi>free Power</hi> of <hi>choosing</hi> or <hi>refusing;</hi> and the part of a <hi>preserver,</hi> in maintaining that power, and as an <hi>universal cause</hi> concurring to <hi>all acts in genere,</hi> as the <hi>sun</hi> doth shine on the <hi>dunghill</hi> and the <hi>flowers:</hi> and that he also do the part of a <hi>just Governour</hi> in prohibiting, and disswading, and threatning sinners.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> But how can sin Eventually be, if God decree it not, seeing all Events are from his Will?</p>
                     <p>I answer 1. We are agreed that he <hi>Causeth it not.</hi> 2. And that he doth not so much as <hi>Will the Event of sin as sin.</hi> 3. And that he <hi>willingly permitteth</hi> what is by him permitted. 4. And that sin is such a thing as <hi>may Evenire,</hi> be brought forth by a <hi>bare permission,</hi> if there be no <hi>Positive Decree</hi> for the <hi>Event.</hi> As a <hi>Negative</hi> in the <hi>effects,</hi> requireth not a <hi>Positive Cause,</hi> so neither a <hi>Positive Will</hi> for its production. There are millions of millions of worlds, and individual creatures, and species <hi>Possible,</hi> that shall <hi>never be:</hi> And it is audacious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to assert, that there must be millions of millions of <hi>Positive Decrees,</hi> that such worlds or creatures shall <hi>not be.<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> 5. Nor is it any dishonour to God, if he have not a <hi>Positive Decree</hi> or <hi>Will</hi> about every Negation (as that all the men in the world shall not be called by a thousand <hi>possible names</hi> rather then their <hi>own,</hi> &amp;c.)</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="82" facs="tcp:59347:55"/>These things being all certain, I add 1. Let them dispute that dare, that yet <hi>de facto</hi> God doth <hi>Positively Will</hi> the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents</hi> of all Privations, or Negations of acts. 2. But when men are once <hi>habitually wicked,</hi> and <hi>bent</hi> to evil, it is just with him, if he <hi>permit them</hi> to follow their own lusts, and if he leave before them such Mercies as he foreknoweth they will wilfulfully make occasions of their sin; and if he resolve to make use of the sin which he knoweth they will commit, for his Churches Good, and for his Glory.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> But doth not God Will that sin Eventually shall not be?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Even as I before said, he willeth that obedience <hi>eventually shall be.</hi> If sin come to pass, it is certain that God did not <hi>simply Will</hi> that it should <hi>not come to pass:</hi> For then he must be conquered and unhappy by every sin: But he <hi>willeth simply</hi> that it shall be the <hi>Duty</hi> of man to avoid it; And he may be said to <hi>Nill</hi> the <hi>Event in tantum,</hi> so far as that he <hi>will forbid it,</hi> and <hi>threaten</hi> and <hi>disswade</hi> the sinner, and give him the <hi>helps,</hi> that shall leave him unexcusable if he sin, and so leave it to his Will. <hi>Thus far</hi> he may be said <hi>to Will that sin Eventually shall not be;</hi> but not <hi>simply.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Though these things are not obvious to vulgar capacities, yet they are such, as the subject in hand, <hi>viz.</hi> Gods <hi>first cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation</hi> and <hi>Creation,</hi> together with the weight of them, and the contentions of the world about them, have made need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
                     <p>3. If God be the <hi>Creator and the cause of all,</hi> then we must remember that <hi>all his works are Good:</hi> and therefore nothing must be <hi>hated</hi> by us that hath he made, considered in its native Goodness. God <hi>hateth sin,</hi> and so must <hi>we:</hi> for that he <hi>made</hi> it not, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 6. <hi>Psal.</hi> 45. 7. <hi>Isa.</hi> 1. 14. And he <hi>hateth all the works of iniquity</hi> as such, <hi>Psal.</hi> 5. 5. and so must we; but we must Love all of God that is in them, and Love them for it. There is somewhat Good and Amiable in every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; yea all of it, that is of God. Though Toads and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents are odious to us, because they are hurtful and seem de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in themselves, yet are they <hi>Good in themselves,</hi> and not deformed as <hi>parts of the universe,</hi> but <hi>Good</hi> unto the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon end.</hi> The <hi>wants</hi> in the wheels of your watch are as use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

to the motion as the <hi>nucks</hi> or solid parts. The <hi>night</hi> is part of the useful order of the creation, as well as the <hi>day.</hi> The va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant interspace in your writing, is needful as well as the words: Every letter should not be a <hi>vowel,</hi> nor every chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter a Capital; Every <hi>member</hi> should not be a <hi>heart</hi> or <hi>head</hi> or <hi>eye:</hi> Nor should every one in a Commonwealth be a <hi>King,</hi> or <hi>Lord:</hi> So in the Creation the parts that seem base, are useful in their places, and good unto their Ends. Let us not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vilifie or detest the works of God, but study the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies of them, and see, and admire, and Love them as they are of God. It is one of the hardest practical points before us, to know how to esteem of all the Creatures, and to use them without running into one extream. At the same time to <hi>Love the world,</hi> and <hi>not to Love</hi> it; to <hi>honour</hi> it, and <hi>despise</hi> it: to <hi>exalt</hi> it, and to tread it under our feet; to <hi>mind it,</hi> and use it with delight, and yet to be <hi>weaned</hi> from it as those that mind it not. And yet a great part of our Christian duty ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the doing of this difficult work. As the world is the Devils bait, and the fleshes Idol, set up against God, and would tice us from him, or hinder us in his service, and either be our Carnal end and happiness, or a means thereto, so we must make it the care of our hearts to hate it, despise it, neglect it, and tread it under foot; and the labour of our lives to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer it. But the same creatures must be admired, studyed, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, honoured, delighted in, and daily used, as they are the excellent work of the Almighty God and reveal to us his Attributes or will, being the Glass in which we must see him while we are in the flesh; and as they lead us to God, and strengthen, furnish or help us in his service. But to Love them <hi>for God,</hi> and <hi>not for themselves,</hi> O how hard is it! To keep <hi>pure affections</hi> towards them and a <hi>spiritual</hi> delight in in them that shall <hi>not degenerate into a carnal delight,</hi> is a task for the holiest Saint on Earth, to labour in with all his care and power, as long as he here liveth. Yet this must be done; and the soul that hath obtained true self denyal, and is dead to the world, and devoted and alive to God, is able in some good measure to perform it. To love the world <hi>for it self,</hi> and make the creature our <hi>chief delight,</hi> and <hi>live to it</hi> as our <hi>End</hi> and <hi>Idol,</hi> this is the common damning course.

Reason</hi> and <hi>Natural freedom of the Will,</hi> are <hi>Gods work,</hi> and not <hi>yours,</hi> and therefore must be honoured, and not scorned and revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; But the <hi>blindness</hi> and <hi>errour</hi> of your Reason, and the <hi>bad inclinations</hi> and <hi>actions</hi> of your free-wills, these are your <hi>own,</hi> and therefore vilifie them and hate them and spare not. And when you lament the <hi>smalness</hi> of your <hi>Graces, deny</hi> them not, and sleight not, but magnifie the preciousness of <hi>that little</hi> that you have, while you mourn for the imperfection. And when men offend you, or prove your enemies, forget not to value and love that of God that yet is in them. <hi>All is Good that is of God.</hi>

                     <p>4. If all things <hi>be of God</hi> as the <hi>Creator</hi> and <hi>Conserver,</hi> we must hence <hi>remember on whom it is that our selves and all things else depend. In him we live and move and have our being,</hi> Act. 17. 28. <hi>He upholdeth all things by the word of his power,</hi> Heb. 1. 3. The earth standeth upon his will and word. The
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:59347:56"/>
Nations are in his hands, so are the <hi>lives</hi> of our <hi>friends</hi> and <hi>enemies,</hi> and so are <hi>our selves.</hi> And therefore our eye must be upon him; and our care must be to please him; and our trust and quietness must be in him; and blessed is he that maketh sure of an Interest in his special Love.</p>
                     <p>5. Hence also we must observe the <hi>vanity of all Creature confidence,</hi> and our hearts must be withdrawn from resting in any means or instruments. They <hi>are nothing</hi> to us, and can <hi>do nothing</hi> for us, but what they have or do from him that <hi>made</hi> and <hi>preserveth</hi> us.</p>
                     <p>6. And lastly hence also we may <hi>see the patience and goodness of the Lord,</hi> that as he refused not to <hi>make</hi> those men that he <hi>foreknew</hi> would live ungodlily, so he denyeth not to <hi>uphold</hi> their <hi>Being,</hi> even while they sin against him. All the while that they are abusing his creatures, they are <hi>substained</hi> by him, and have <hi>those Creatures</hi> from him. From <hi>him</hi> the <hi>drunkard</hi> hath his drink, and the <hi>glutton</hi> his meat, and the <hi>voluptuous</hi> youth their abused health and strength; and <hi>all men</hi> have from him the <hi>Powers</hi> or faculties of soul and Body by which, they sin. And shall any be so ungrateful as to say therefore that <hi>God doth cause their sin?</hi> Its true, he <hi>can easily</hi> stop thy breath while thou art swearing, and lying, and speaking against the service of God that made thee: And wouldst <hi>thou</hi> have <hi>him</hi> do so? He <hi>can easily</hi> take away the meat, and drink, and riches, and health, and life which thou abusest; And wouldst thou <hi>have</hi> him do it? He <hi>can easily</hi> keep thee from sinning any more on earth, by cutting off thy life and sending thee to pay for what thou hast done: And art thou <hi>content</hi> with this? Must he be taken to be a partaker in thy sin, because he doth not strike thee dead, or lame, or speech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, or <hi>disable</hi> thee from sinning? Provoke him not by thy Blasphemies, lest he clear himself in a way that thou desirest not. But O wonder at his patience, that holds thee in his hand, and keepeth thee from falling into the grave and Hell, while thou art sinning against him. While a curse or oath is in thy mouth, he could let thee fall into utter misery. How oft hast thou provoked him to take thee in thy lust, in thy rage, or in thy neglect of God, and give thee thy desert! Would any of <hi>you</hi> support your enemy, as God doth you?</p>

                     <p>10. AS we must know God as our <hi>Creatour,</hi> so also as our <hi>Redeemer;</hi> Of which I shall say but little now, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I have mentioned it more fully in the <hi>Directions for sound Conversion.</hi> It is <hi>life Eternal</hi> to <hi>know the Father, and Jesus Christ whom he hath sent,</hi> Job. 17. 3. The <hi>Father Redeemeth</hi> us by the <hi>Son,</hi> whom he sent, and whose Sacrifice he accepted, and in whom he is well pleased. And this must have these effects upon our souls.</p>
                     <p>1. We must be hence convinced, that we <hi>are not now in a state of innocency, nor to be saved as innocents, or on the terms of the Law of our Creation:</hi> Bue Salvation is now by a <hi>Redeemer:</hi> and therefore consisteth in our <hi>recovery and restauration.</hi> The objects of it are only <hi>lapsed sinful miserable men.</hi> Name the Creature if you can since <hi>Adam,</hi> that stood before God here in the flesh, in a state of <hi>personal perfect innocency,</hi> except the <hi>immaculate Lamb of God.</hi> If God <hi>as Creator</hi> should now save any, without respect to a <hi>Redemption,</hi> it must be on the terms of the <hi>Law of Creation,</hi> upon which it is certain that no man hath or shall be saved; that is, upon <hi>perfect personal perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering obedience.</hi> You cannot exempt <hi>Infants</hi> themselves from sin and misery, without exempting them from Christ the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer,</hi> and the <hi>remedy,</hi> Rom. 3. 10, 19, 20, 22, 23. [<hi>There is none Righteous</hi> (in himself without a Redeemer) <hi>no not one—They are all gone out of the way—That every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.</hi> (And if all the <hi>world</hi> be guilty, <hi>none</hi> are innocent:) <hi>therefore by the deeds of the Law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight. For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God; being justified freely by his grace through the Redemption that is in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ</hi>] Isa. 53. 6. <hi>All we like sheep have gone astray, we have turned every one to his own way, and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.</hi>] Rom. 5. 15. [<hi>Through the offence of one, many are dead</hi>] 16. <hi>And the judgement was by One to condemnation</hi>] 17. <hi>By the offence of one death reigned by one.</hi>] 18. <hi>By the offence of one, judgement came on all men to
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:59347:57"/>
condemnation.</hi>] 19. <hi>By one mans disobedience many were made sinners</hi>] Psal. 51. 4. [<hi>We were shapen in iniquity, and in sin did our mothers conceive us</hi>] Eph. 2. 1, 3. <hi>We were by nature the Children of wrath, and dead in trespasses and sin</hi>] 1 Cor. 15. 22. [<hi>In Adam all die</hi>] 2 Cor. 5. 14 [<hi>We thus judge, that if one dyed for all, then were all dead</hi>] Eph 5. 23. <hi>Christ is the Saviour of the Body</hi>] &amp; v. 25, 26, 27. [<hi>Christ loved the Church and gave himself for it, that he might sanctifie and cleanse it with the washing of water, by the word, that he might present it to himself a glorious Church</hi>—] If <hi>Infants</hi> have no sin and misery, then they are none of the <hi>Body, the Church,</hi> which Christ <hi>loved</hi> and <hi>gave himself</hi> for that he might <hi>cleanse</hi> it. But what need we further proof when we have the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon experience of all the world? Would every man that is born of a woman without exception, so <hi>early manifest</hi> sin in the <hi>life,</hi> if there were no <hi>corrupt disposition</hi> at the <hi>heart?</hi> And should <hi>all mankind</hi> without exception, tast of the <hi>punishment</hi> of sin, if they had no participation of the <hi>guilt? Death is the wages of sin;</hi> and <hi>by sin death entred into the world, and it pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth upon all men, for that all have sinned,</hi> Rom. 5. 12. <hi>Infants</hi> have <hi>sickness,</hi> and <hi>torments,</hi> and <hi>death,</hi> which are the fruits of sin. And were they not presented to Christ as a <hi>Saviour,</hi> when he took them in his arms and blessed them, and said, <hi>Of such is the Kingdom of God?</hi> Certainly, none that never were guilty or miserable, are capable of a place in the <hi>Kingdom of the Mediator.</hi> For to what end should he <hi>mediate</hi> for them? or how can he <hi>Redeem</hi> them that <hi>need not</hi> a Redemption? or how should he <hi>reconcile</hi> them to God that never were at <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi> with him? Or how can he <hi>wash them</hi> that were never <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean?</hi> Or how can he be a <hi>Physicion</hi> to them that never were <hi>sick? when the whole have no need of the Physicion,</hi> Mat. 9. 12. He <hi>came to seek and to save that which was lost,</hi> Luk. 19. 10. and to save <hi>his people from their sins,</hi> Mat. 1. 21. They are none of <hi>his saved people</hi> therefore that had <hi>no sin.</hi> He came to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem those that were under the Law,</hi> Gal. 4. 5.

Nor any <hi>Justification</hi> but <hi>from sin,</hi> and <hi>from what we could not be Justified from by the Law of</hi> Moses, Act. 13. 30. Nor any <hi>Justification</hi> but what containeth a <hi>Remission of sin,</hi> Rom. 3. 25. And where there is <hi>no sin,</hi> there is none to be Remitted. Nor is there any Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation but what is <hi>through the Redemption that is in Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, and his propitiation,</hi> Rom. 3. 24, 25. <hi>He is made of God Redemption to us,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 30. And the <hi>Redemption</hi> that we have by him, is <hi>Remission of sins by his blood,</hi> Col. 1. 14. Eph. 1. 7. <hi>By his own blood entered he once into the holy place, having obtained eternal Redemption for us:</hi> The <hi>eternal inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> is received <hi>by means of death for the Redemption of trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions,</hi> Heb. 9. 12, 15.] so that all Scripture speaks this truth aloud to us, that there is now no <hi>salvation</hi> promised but to the <hi>Church,</hi> the <hi>Justified,</hi> the <hi>Regenerate,</hi> the <hi>Redeemed;</hi> and that none can be capable of <hi>these</hi> but <hi>sinners,</hi> and such as are <hi>lost</hi> and miserable in themselves. And till <hi>our necessity</hi> be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, <hi>Redemption</hi> cannot be well understood. They that believe that Christ dyed not only for this or that man in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, but for <hi>the world,</hi> methinks should believe that <hi>the world are sinners</hi> and need his death. He is called <hi>the Saviour of the world,</hi> Joh. 4. 42. and the <hi>Saviour of all men, especially of believers,</hi> 1 Tim. 4. 10. 1 Joh. 4. 14. <hi>We have seen and do testifie that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world</hi>] And from <hi>what</hi> doth he save them? <hi>From their sins,</hi> Mat. 1. 21. and <hi>from the wrath to come,</hi> 1 Thes. 1. 10. [<hi>For this is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation,</hi> that Christ <hi>Jesus came into the world to save sinners] Infants</hi> then are <hi>sinners,</hi> or none of those that he came to save. Christ hath made no man <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> by his <hi>Obedience,</hi> but such as <hi>Adam</hi> made <hi>sinners</hi> by <hi>his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience,</hi> Rom. 5. 19. [<hi>For as by one mans disobedience, many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one many shall be made Righteous.] Infants</hi> are not made <hi>Righteous</hi> by Christ, if they were <hi>not sinners:</hi> And <hi>sinners</hi> they cannot be by any but <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal sin,</hi> Rom. 5. 8, 9, 10. [<hi>God commended his Love to us, in that while we were yet sinners Christ dyed for us: Much more
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:59347:60"/>
being now Justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him: When we were enemies we were Reconciled to God by the death of his Son</hi>] so that it is <hi>sinners</hi> that <hi>Christ dyed for,</hi> and <hi>sinners</hi> that <hi>are justified by his blood,</hi> and <hi>sinners</hi> that are <hi>reconciled to God. Infants</hi> therefore are <hi>sinners,</hi> or they are none of the <hi>Redeemed, Justified</hi> or <hi>reconciled.</hi> And when Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ [<hi>by the grace of God did taste death for every man</hi>] Heb. 2. 9. <hi>Infants</hi> are sure included. [<hi>There is one Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself a Ransom for all,</hi> 1 Tim. 2. 5, 6.] therefore all had <hi>sin and misery</hi> and <hi>needed</hi> that ransome. [<hi>He is the propitiation for our sins,</hi> and <hi>not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world</hi>] And is it not plain then that the <hi>whole world</hi> are <hi>sinners?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I speak all this for the evincing of Original sin only, because <hi>that only</hi> is denyed by such as yet pretend to Christianity; For <hi>actual</hi> sin is commonly confessed, and shews it self. And truly so doth <hi>Original sin</hi> in our <hi>proneness to actual;</hi> and in the <hi>earliness</hi> and <hi>commonness</hi> of such <hi>evil inclinations;</hi> and in the <hi>remnants</hi> of it which the sanctified feel, though they are such as were sanctified never so <hi>early,</hi> before actual sin had time to breed those evil habits, which therefore certainly were <hi>born</hi> with us.</p>
                     <p>And if the <hi>Image of God,</hi> consisting in true <hi>holiness,</hi> be not <hi>natural,</hi> or <hi>born</hi> in every <hi>Infant</hi> in the world, then <hi>Original sin</hi> must needs be born with them: for <hi>that sin</hi> is either <hi>only</hi> or <hi>chiefly</hi> the <hi>Privation of that Image</hi> or <hi>Holiness.</hi> He that will say that this <hi>Image</hi> is not requisite to <hi>Infants,</hi> and so that the absence of it is a meer <hi>negation,</hi> doth make them <hi>bruits,</hi> and not of the race of man, whom God <hi>created</hi> after his <hi>Image,</hi> and leaves them uncapable of <hi>Heaven</hi> or <hi>Hell,</hi> or any other <hi>life then beasts</hi> have. And he that thinks so of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <hi>Infants</hi> to <hi>day,</hi> may think so of <hi>himself</hi> to <hi>morrow.</hi> And he that will affirm that <hi>this Image</hi> or <hi>Holiness</hi> is <hi>born with every Infant</hi> into the world, so wilfully contradicteth common evidence which appeareth in the contrary effects, that he is not worthy to be further talkt with.</p>
                     <p>One thing more I will propound yet to the contrary-mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; Can they say that <hi>any Infants are saved or not?</hi> If <hi>not,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they perish as <hi>bruits</hi> (which is a <hi>bruitish</hi> opinion) or they <hi>live in misery;</hi> and then they <hi>had sin</hi> that did <hi>deserve it;</hi> yea if they think that <hi>any</hi> of them perish in the <hi>wrath to come,</hi>
                        <pb n="90" facs="tcp:59347:61"/>
it must be <hi>for sin.</hi> If they think that <hi>any</hi> of them <hi>are saved,</hi> it is either <hi>by covenant</hi> or <hi>without;</hi> there is <hi>some promise</hi> for it, or there <hi>is none.</hi> If <hi>none,</hi> then no man can say that <hi>any</hi> of them are <hi>saved.</hi> For who hath known the mind of the Lord without his Revelation? It is arrogancy to tell the world of the saving of any that God did no way reveal that he will save. But if they plead a <hi>Revelation</hi> or <hi>promise,</hi> it is either the <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> or of <hi>Grace;</hi> a <hi>promise</hi> contained in <hi>Nature, Law</hi> or <hi>Gospel.</hi> The <hi>former</hi> cannot be affirmed, (not only because the dissenters themselves deny any such <hi>Covenant</hi> to have been in nature or any way made to <hi>Adam,</hi> but) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is no such Covenant or <hi>promise</hi> in <hi>Nature</hi> to be <hi>found,</hi> for the Salvation of <hi>all Infants</hi> (and if not <hi>for all,</hi> then for <hi>none:</hi>) and because it is contrary to abundance of plain passages in the Scriptures, that assure us there is but <hi>One Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> of <hi>Salvation</hi> now in force: and that all the <hi>world shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come guilty before God,</hi> and <hi>every mouth be stopped,</hi> Rom. 3. 19. and that <hi>by the deeds of the Law no flesh shall be justified in his sight,</hi> v. 20. Gal. 2. 16. And if <hi>righteousness come by the Law, then Christ is dead in vain,</hi> Gal. 2. 21. <hi>For as many as are of the works of the Law, are under the Curse,</hi> Gal. 3. 10. <hi>And that no man is Justified by the Law in the sight of God, is evident; for the just shall live by faith; and the Law is not of faith; but, The man that doth them shall live in them</hi> And certainly the <hi>Law of nature</hi> requireth not less then <hi>Moses Law,</hi> to a mans justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, if not more. And [<hi>if there had been a Law given which</hi> could have <hi>given life, verily Righteousness should have been by the Law.</hi> But <hi>the Scripture hath concluded All under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that belive</hi>] Gal. 3. 21, 22.</p>
                     <p>By the fulness of this evidence, it is easie to see, that <hi>Infants</hi> and all mankind are <hi>sinners,</hi> and therefore have <hi>need</hi> of the <hi>Redeemer.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. To <hi>know God as our Redeemer,</hi> containeth the knowledge of the <hi>great ends</hi> of our <hi>Redemption,</hi> and of the manifestation of God to man thereby. Having treated of these in the Book fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, I shall now say but this in brief. It is beyond dispute, that God <hi>could</hi> have made man capable of Glory, and kept him from falling by confirming grace, and without a Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:59347:61"/>
setled him in felicity, as he did the Angels. He that foresaw mans fall and necessity of a Saviour, could easily have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented that sin and necessity: But he <hi>would</hi> not; he <hi>did</hi> not: but chose rather to permit it, and save man by the way of a <hi>Redeemer.</hi> In which his <hi>Infinite wisdom</hi> is exceedingly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested. And in Christ who is the <hi>Power and Wisdom of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 24. among others these excellent effects are decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to us, which the <hi>way of Redemption</hi> attaineth above what the saving us on the terms of <hi>Nature</hi> would have attained.</p>
                     <p>1. <hi>God</hi> is now wonderfully <hi>admired</hi> and <hi>magnified</hi> in the <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> of the <hi>Redeemer.</hi> Angels themselves desire to pry into this mysterie, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 12. As the frame of <hi>Nature</hi> is set us to <hi>see God in,</hi> where we daily as in a <hi>glass</hi> behold him and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire him; so the <hi>person of the Redeemer,</hi> and work of <hi>Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> and <hi>Redemption,</hi> is set the Angels for their contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and admiration, as well as us: Eph. 3. 10. [<hi>To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the Church the manifold wisdom of God.</hi>] And in the glorious <hi>perfection</hi> and <hi>dignity</hi> of the Redeemer will God be <hi>everlastingly glorified;</hi> For his <hi>greatest</hi> works do <hi>greatliest</hi> honour him: And as the <hi>sun</hi> doth now to us more honour him then a <hi>star,</hi> so the <hi>glorified person</hi> of the <hi>Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> doth more honour God then man or Angels. 1 Pet. 3. 23. [<hi>He is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and Authorities, and Powers being made subject to him.</hi>] Eph. 1. 20, 21, 22. <hi>Being raised from the dead, God hath set him at his own right hand in heavenly places, far above all principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, and powers, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come; and hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the Head over all things to the Church, which is his Body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all.</hi>] Heb. 1. 3. [<hi>Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sate down on the right hand of the Majesty on high; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made so much better then the Angels, as he hath by inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance obtained a more excellent name then they<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi>]</p>
                     <p>And here a very <hi>great truth</hi> appeareth, which very many overlook, that the <hi>exaltation</hi> of the <hi>person of the Redeemer,</hi> and
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:59347:62"/>
the <hi>glory</hi> that God will have <hi>in him,</hi> is a <hi>higher</hi> and more <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal</hi> part of Gods <hi>intent</hi> in the sending of him to be <hi>Incarnate</hi> and <hi>Redeem</hi> us, then the <hi>glorifying of man,</hi> and of God <hi>by us.</hi> Christ will <hi>be more glorious</hi> then <hi>men</hi> or <hi>Angels,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will <hi>more glorifie God;</hi> and God will eternally take <hi>more complacency</hi> in him then in <hi>men or Angels;</hi> And therefore (though in several respects) <hi>He</hi> is <hi>for us,</hi> and the <hi>means</hi> of <hi>our felicity;</hi> and <hi>we</hi> are <hi>for him,</hi> and the <hi>means</hi> of <hi>his glory</hi> (as the <hi>Head</hi> is <hi>for the Body,</hi> and the <hi>Body for the Head</hi>) yet <hi>we</hi> are <hi>more for Christ</hi> as a <hi>means</hi> to <hi>his glory,</hi> then <hi>he for us:</hi> I mean he is the <hi>more excellent principal end. [For to this end Christ both dyed, rose and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living</hi>] Rom. 14. 9. [<hi>who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God; but made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men: and being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient unto death, even the death of the Cross: Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name, which is above every name; that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, both of things in heaven and things in earth and under the earth; and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father</hi>] Phil. 2. 6. to 12. Rev. 5. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. [<hi>And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many Angels round about the Throne, and the beasts, and the elders, and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands: saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain, to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing: And every creature which is in Heaven, and on Earth, and under the Earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing, honour, glory and power be unto him that sitteth on the Throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever.</hi>] So Rev. 15. 3, 4. &amp; 20. 6. Rev. 21. 23. [<hi>The City had no need of the Sun, neither of the Moon to shine in it; for the glory of God doth lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof</hi>] Rev. 22. 3, 4. [<hi>The Throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it, and his servants shall serve him; And they shall see his face, and his name shall be in their foreheads.</hi>] These and many other Scriptures shew us, that God will be for ever <hi>Glorified</hi> in
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:59347:62"/>
the <hi>person of the Redeemer, more</hi> then in either <hi>men</hi> or <hi>Angels:</hi> and consequently that it was the <hi>principal part</hi> of his <hi>Intention</hi> in the design of mans Redemption.</p>
                     <p>2. (I will be briefer in the rest) In the <hi>way of Redemption</hi> man will be saved with <hi>greater humiliation</hi> and <hi>self-denyal</hi> then he should have been in the way of <hi>Creation.</hi> If we had been saved in a way of <hi>Innocency,</hi> we should have had more to ascribe to our selves. And it is meet that all Creatures be <hi>humbled</hi> and abased, and nothing in themselves, before the Lord.</p>
                     <p>3. By the way of <hi>Redemption, sin will be more dishonoured,</hi> and <hi>Holiness</hi> more advanced, then if sin had never been known in the world. Contraries illustrate one another. <hi>Health</hi> would not be so much valued if there were no <hi>sickness:</hi> nor <hi>Life</hi> if there were no <hi>Death:</hi> nor <hi>Day</hi> if there were no <hi>Night:</hi> nor <hi>Knowledge</hi> if there were no <hi>Ignorance:</hi> nor <hi>Good</hi> if man had not known <hi>Evil.</hi> The <hi>Holiness of God</hi> would never have appeared in execution of vindictive Justice against sin, if there had never <hi>been</hi> any <hi>sin:</hi> and therefore he hath <hi>permitted</hi> it, and will recover us from it, when he could have prevented our falling into it.</p>
                     <p>4. By this way also, Holiness and <hi>Recovering Grace shall be more triumphant against the Devil and all</hi> its enemies: By the many conquests that Christ will make over Satan, the World and the Flesh, and Death, there will very much of God be seen to us, that <hi>innocency</hi> would not thus have <hi>manifested.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>5. <hi>Redemption</hi> brings <hi>God nearer unto man:</hi> The mysterie of Incarnation giveth us wonderful advantages to have more <hi>familiar</hi> thoughts of God, and to see him in a <hi>clearer glass,</hi> then ever we should else have seen him in on <hi>earth,</hi> and to have <hi>access with boldness to the throne of grace.</hi> The <hi>pure Deity</hi> is at so vast a <hi>distance</hi> from us, while we are here in flesh, that if it had not appeared in the flesh unto us, we should have been at a greater loss. But now <hi>without controversie great is the mysterie of godliness; God was manifested in the flesh, justified in the spirit, seen of Angels, preached to the Gentiles, believed on in the world, and received up into glory,</hi> 1 Tim. 3. 16.</p>
                     <p>6. In the way of <hi>Redemption,</hi> man is <hi>brought to more earnest and frequent addresses unto God,</hi> and <hi>dependance</hi> on him: <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity</hi>
                        <pb n="94" facs="tcp:59347:63"/>
driveth him: And he hath use for more of God, or for God in <hi>more</hi> of the wayes of his mercy, then else he would have had.</p>
                     <p>7. <hi>Principally</hi> in this way of saving miserable man by a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer,</hi> there is <hi>opportunity</hi> for the <hi>more abundant exercise of Gods mercy,</hi> and consequently for the more <hi>glorious discovery of his Love and Goodness</hi> to the sons of men, then if they had fallen into no such Necessities. Misery prepareth men for the sense of <hi>mercy.</hi> In the Redeemer there is so wonderful a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Mercy,</hi> as is the astonishment of men and Angels. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 1. [<hi>Behold what manner of Love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God!</hi>] Eph. 2. 4, 5. [<hi>God who is rich in Mercy, for his great Love wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ (by grace yee are saved) and hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus; that in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace, in his kindness towards us by Christ Jesus: for by grace yee are saved through faith, and that not of your selves, it is the gift of God: Not of works lest any man should boast</hi>] Tit. 3 3, 4. <hi>For we our selves were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man appeared, not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his Mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Ghost</hi>] Never was there such a discovery of <hi>God</hi> as he is <hi>Love,</hi> in a way of <hi>Mercy</hi> to man on earth, as in the <hi>Redeemer,</hi> and his <hi>benefits.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>8. In the way of <hi>Redemption</hi> the <hi>soul of man is formed to the most sweet and excellent temper,</hi> and his <hi>obedience cast into the happiest mold.</hi> The glorious demonstration of <hi>Love,</hi> doth animate us with <hi>Love to God;</hi> and the shedding abroad of <hi>his Love</hi> in our hearts by the spirit of the Redeemer, doth draw out our hearts in <hi>Love</hi> to him again: And the sense of his wonderful <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Mercy</hi> filleth us with <hi>Thankfulness:</hi> so that <hi>Love</hi> is hereby made the <hi>nature</hi> of the <hi>new man;</hi> and <hi>Thankfulness</hi> is the life of all our obedience: For all floweth from <hi>these principles,</hi> and expresseth them: so that <hi>Love</hi> is the <hi>compendium</hi> of all Holiness in one word; and <hi>Thankfulness</hi> of
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:59347:63"/>
all <hi>Evangelical obedience.</hi> And it is a more sweet and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent state of life, to be the <hi>Spouse of Christ,</hi> and his <hi>members,</hi> and serve God as <hi>friends</hi> and <hi>children,</hi> with <hi>Love and Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness,</hi> then to serve him meerly as the most <hi>loyal subjects,</hi> or with an obedience that hath less of Love.</p>
                     <p>9. In the way of <hi>Redemption, Holiness is more admirably exemplified in Christ,</hi> then it was, or would have been in <hi>Adam. Adam</hi> would never have declared it in that eminency of <hi>Charity to others,</hi> submission to God, contempt of the world, self-denyal, and conquest of Satan, as <hi>Christ</hi> hath done.</p>
                     <p>10. And in the way of <hi>Redemption,</hi> there is <hi>a double obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion laid upon man</hi> for every duty. To the obligations of <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> all the obligations of <hi>Redemption</hi> and the <hi>new Creation</hi> are superadded: And this threefold cord should not so easily be broken. Here are <hi>moral</hi> means more <hi>powerfully</hi> to hold the soul to God.</p>
                     <p>11. And in this way there is a <hi>clearer discovery of the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting state of man, and life and immortality are more fully brought to light by the Gospel</hi> (2 Tim. 1. 10) then for ought we find in Scripture, they were to <hi>innocent man</hi> himself [<hi>No man hath seen God at any time: the only begotten Son that is in the bosome of the Father, he hath declared him,</hi> Joh. 1. 18.] <hi>For no man hath ascended up into heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the son of man, which is in heaven,</hi> Joh 3. 13.</p>
                     <p>12. Man will be advanced, to the <hi>judging of the ungodly</hi> and of the <hi>conquered Angels:</hi> even by the good will of the Father, and a participation in the honour of Christ our head, and by a participation in his Victories, and by our own Victories in his strength, by the right of Conquest, we shall judge with Christ, both Devils and men, that were enemies to him, and our salvation: as you may see 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 2, 3. And there is more in that promise then we yet well understand, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 26, 27. [<hi>He that overcometh, and keepeth my words unto the end, to him will I give power over the Nations, and he shall rule them with a rod of Iron, as the vessels of a Potter shall they be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to shivers, even as I received of my Father.</hi>]</p>
                     <p>13. And that which <hi>Augustine</hi> so much insisteth on, I think is also plain in Scripture, that the <hi>Salvation of the Elect is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:59347:64"/>
secured in the hands of Christ, then his own</hi> or any of his posterities was in the hands of <hi>Adam.</hi> We know that <hi>Adam</hi> lost that which was committed to him: But [<hi>we know whom we have believed, and are perswaded, that he is able to keep that which we commit to him, against that day</hi>] 1 Tim. 1. 12. Force not these Scriptures against our own Consolation, and the glory of our Redeemer, and then judge. [<hi>Joh.</hi> 7. 2. <hi>As thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal Life to as many as thou hast given him</hi>] Joh. 6. 3. [<hi>All that the Father giveth me, shall come to me; and him that cometh to me, I will in no wise cast out</hi>] Ver. 39. <hi>And this is the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day</hi>] Joh. 10. 26, 27, 28, 29. [<hi>But yee believe not, because yee are not of my sheep, as I said unto you: My sheep hear my voice, and I know them and they follow me, and I give unto them eternal life, and they shall never perish, and none shall take them out of my hands: My Father which gave them me is greater then all, and no man is able to pluck them out of my Fathers hands</hi>] Eph. 1. 3, 4. <hi>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ, according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in Love: Having predestinated us to the adoption of his children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will, to the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved] [Being predestinated according to the purpose of him that worketh all things after the counsel of his own will</hi>] Ver. 11.</p>
                     <p>And if <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Repentance,</hi> and the <hi>right disposition of the will</hi> it self, be his resolved <hi>gift</hi> to his <hi>Elect,</hi> and not things left meerly to our <hi>uncertain wills,</hi> then the case is past all question. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 25, 26. [<hi>In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves, if God peradventure will give them Repentance to the acknowledging of the truth, and that they may recover themselves our of the snare of the Devil</hi>] Eph. 2. 8.

[<hi>A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you, and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh and give you an heart of flesh, and I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes</hi>]—See also <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. where this is called the <hi>new and better Covenant [I will put my Laws in their minds and write them in their hearts</hi>—] Jer. 31. 33. And <hi>Jer.</hi> 32. 39, 40. <hi>And I will give them one heart and one way that they may fear me for ever. And I will make an everlasting Covenant with them, and I will not turn away from them to do them good, but I will put my fear in their hearts that they shall not depart from me</hi>] 1 Cor. 4. 7. <hi>Who makes thee to differ? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi>] Much more may be produced, from which it is evident that <hi>Christ is the Author and finisher of our Faith;</hi> and that the <hi>certainty</hi> of the <hi>salvation</hi> of his <hi>Elect,</hi> doth lie more on <hi>his undertaking</hi> and <hi>resolution</hi> infallibly to accomplish their salvation, then upon <hi>our wisdom,</hi> or the sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of our mutable <hi>free-wills:</hi> and that thus we are <hi>better</hi> in the hands of the <hi>second Adam,</hi> then we were in the hands of the <hi>first.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>14. To conclude; <hi>Vindictive Justice will be doubly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured upon them that are final rejecters of this grace.</hi> Though conscience would have had matter enough to work upon for the torment of the sinner, and the justifying of God, upon the meer violation of the <hi>Law of nature</hi> or works, yet nothing to what it <hi>now</hi> will have on them that are the despisers of this great salvation. <hi>For of how much sorer punishment suppose yee shall he be thought worthy that hath trodden under foot the Son of God?</hi>] when it is <hi>willful impenitency,</hi> against <hi>most excellent means</hi> and <hi>mercies,</hi> that is to be charged upon sinners, and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:59347:65"/>
when they perish because they <hi>would not</hi> be saved, Justice will be most fully glorified before all, and in the conscience of the sinner himself. All this considered you may see that (besides what reasons of the counsel of God are unknown to us) there is abundant reason open to our sight, from the great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of this way, why God would rather save us by a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer,</hi> then in a way of <hi>Innocency</hi> as our meer Creator.</p>
                     <p>But, for the answering of all objections against this, I must desire you to observe these two things following. 1. That we here suppose man a terrestrial inhabitant cloathed with flesh: otherwise it is confessed that if he were <hi>perfect in heaven,</hi> where he had the <hi>Beatifical Vision</hi> to confirm him, many of these forementioned advantages to him would be none.</p>
                     <p>2. And it is supposed that God will work on man by <hi>Moral means;</hi> and where he never so infallibly produceth the good of man, he doth it in a way agreeable to his nature and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent state; and that his work of Grace is <hi>Sapiential,</hi> magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the contrivance and conduct of his <hi>Wisdom,</hi> as well as his <hi>Power:</hi> otherwise indeed God might have done all without these or any other means.</p>
                     <p>3. The knowledge of God <hi>in Christ as our Redeemer,</hi> must imprint upon the soul those <hi>Holy Affections</hi> which the <hi>design</hi> and <hi>nature</hi> of our <hi>Redemption</hi> do bespeak, and which answer these forementioned ends. As 1. It must keep the soul in a sense of the <hi>odiousness of sin,</hi> that must have such a remedy to pardon and destroy it.</p>
                     <p>2. It must raise us to most high and honourable thoughts of our Redeemer, the Captain of our Salvation, that bringeth back l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>st sinners unto God: and we must study to advance the Glory of our Lord, whom the Father hath advanced and set over all.</p>
                     <p>3. It must drive us out of our selves and bring us to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in our own eyes, and cause us to have humble, penitent, self<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> condemning thoughts, as men that have been our own undoers, and deserved so ill of God and man.</p>
                     <p>4. It must drive us to a full and constant dependance on <hi>Christ our Redeemer,</hi> and on the Father by him: As <hi>our life</hi> is now <hi>in the Son</hi> as its <hi>root</hi> and <hi>fountain,</hi> so in him must be our faith and confidence, and to him we must daily have recourse,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:59347:65"/>
and seek to him, and to the Father in his Name for all that we need, for daily pardon, strength, protection, provision and consolation.</p>
                     <p>5. It must cause us the more to admire the Holiness of God, which is so admirably declared in our Redemption; and still be sensible how he hateth sin and loveth Purity.</p>
                     <p>6. It must invite and encourage us to <hi>draw near to God,</hi> who hath condescended to come so near to us; and as sons we must cry <hi>Abba Father,</hi> and though with <hi>reverence,</hi> yet with <hi>holy confidence</hi> must set our selves continually before him.</p>
                     <p>7. It must cause us to make it our daily imployment to stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy the Riches of the Love of God, and his abundant mercy manifested in Christ; so that above all books in the world, we should most diligently and delightfully peruse the <hi>Son of God incarnate,</hi> and in him behold the <hi>Power,</hi> and <hi>Wisdom,</hi> and <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of the Father <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And with <hi>Paul</hi> we should desire <hi>to know nothing but Christ crucified;</hi> and all things should be counted but <hi>loss and dung for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus our Lord,</hi> Phil. 3. 8. <hi>That we may be able to comprehend with all Saints, what is the bredth, and length, and depth, and heighth, and to know the Love of Christ which passeth know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that we may be filled with all the fulness of God.</hi>]</p>
                     <p>8. Above all, if we know God as our <hi>Redeemer,</hi> we must Live in the Power of holy <hi>Love and Gratitude.</hi> His <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested Love</hi> must prevail with us so far, that <hi>unfeigned Love to him</hi> may be the <hi>predominant affection</hi> of our souls. And being free from the <hi>spirit of bondage</hi> and slavish fear, we must make <hi>Love and Thankfulness</hi> the sum of our Religion: and think not any thing will prove us Christians without <hi>prevailing Love to Christ,</hi> nor that any duty is accepted that proceedeth not from it.</p>
                     <p>9. Redemption must teach us to apply our selves to the holy Laws and Example of our Redeemer for the forming and ordering of our hearts and lives.</p>
                     <p>10. And it must quicken us to Love the Lord with a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled vigour,</hi> and to obey with <hi>double</hi> resolution and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, because we are under a <hi>double obligation.</hi> What should a people so Redeemed esteem too much or too dear for God?</p>

Redemption must make us a more <hi>Heavenly</hi> people, as being <hi>Redeemed</hi> to the <hi>incorruptible inheritance</hi> in Heaven: [<hi>The blessed God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, according to his abundant mercy, hath begotten us again unto a lively hope, by the Resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, to an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance incorruptible, undefiled, and that fadeth not away, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in Heaven for us, who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation</hi>] 1 Pet. 1. 3.</p>
                     <p>12. Lastly <hi>Redemption</hi> must cause us to walk the more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and with a greater care to avoid all sin, and to avoid the threatned wrath of God, because sin against such unspeakable Mercy is unspeakably great, and condemnation by a Redeemer for despising his grace will be a <hi>double condemnation,</hi> Joh. 3. 19. 36.</p>

                     <p>11. THE third Relation in which God is to be Known by us, is as he is <hi>our Sanctifier</hi> and <hi>Comforter,</hi> which is specially ascribed to the <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi> And doubtless as the <hi>Dispensation</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> is the <hi>Perfecting dispensation,</hi> without which <hi>Creation</hi> and <hi>Redemption</hi> would not attain their ends; and as the <hi>sin against the Holy Ghost,</hi> is the great and dangerous sin; so our <hi>Belief</hi> in the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God as our <hi>Sanctifier by the Spirit,</hi> is not the <hi>least</hi> or <hi>lowest</hi> act of our faith or Knowledge. And it implieth or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth these things following.</p>
                     <p>1. We must hence take notice of the certainty of <hi>our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon original sin.</hi> The <hi>necessity of sanctification</hi> proveth the <hi>corruption,</hi> as the necessity of a <hi>Redeemer</hi> proveth the <hi>guilt:</hi> It is not <hi>one</hi> but <hi>all</hi> that are <hi>Baptized,</hi> that must be <hi>Baptized in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Name of the Son and Holy Ghost,</hi> as well as of the <hi>Father<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> which is an entering into <hi>Covenant</hi> with the <hi>Son as our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer,</hi> and with the <hi>Holy Ghost as our Sanctifier.</hi> So that <hi>Infants</hi> themselves must be <hi>Sanctified</hi> or be none of the Church of Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which consisteth of <hi>Baptized Sanctified persons. [Except a man be born again</hi> (even of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> as well as
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:59347:66"/>
                        <hi>water) he cannot enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.] For that which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is Spirit,</hi> Joh. 3. 3, 5, 6. and therefore the <hi>fleshly birth</hi> producing not a <hi>Spiritual creature,</hi> will not <hi>save</hi> without the <hi>Spiritual birth:</hi> The words are most plain; not only against them that deny <hi>Original sin,</hi> but against them that misunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the nature of Redemption, do think that all <hi>Infants</hi> are meerly by the <hi>price paid,</hi> put into a state of Salvation, and have the pardon of their Original sin in common, attending their natural Birth. But these men should consider, 1. That this text and constant experience tell us that the <hi>new Birth</hi> doth not thus commonly to all accompany the <hi>natural birth:</hi> and yet without the <hi>new birth</hi> none can be saved, nor without <hi>Holiness any see God.</hi> 2. That Pardon of sin is <hi>no mans</hi> upon the <hi>bare suffering</hi> of Jesus Christ; but must be theirs by some <hi>Covenant</hi> or <hi>Promise</hi> conveying to them a <hi>Right</hi> to the benefits of his suffering. And therefore no man can be said to be pardoned or saved (without great arrogancy in the affirmer) that hath not from God a <hi>promise</hi> of such mercy. But no man can shew any Promise that giveth <hi>Remission of Original sin</hi> to all <hi>Infants.</hi> Produce it, or presume not to affirm it, lest you fall under the heavy doom of those that add to his holy Word. The <hi>Promise</hi> is to the <hi>faithful and their seed.</hi> The rest are not the <hi>children of the promise,</hi> but are under the commination of the violated Law; which indeed is <hi>dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;</hi> and therefore we cannot say that <hi>God will pardon none of them;</hi> but withal, we cannot say that <hi>he will,</hi> unless he had told us so. All the world are in a necessity of a <hi>Sanctifier:</hi> and therefore most certainly (even since Christs death) they are naturally corrupted.</p>
                     <p>2. And as our Belief in the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> as <hi>Sanctifier,</hi> engageth us to acknowledge our <hi>Original sin</hi> and <hi>misery,</hi> so doth it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage us to <hi>magnifie</hi> his <hi>renewing work</hi> of grace, and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the <hi>necessity</hi> of it, and to confess the insufficiency of corrupted nature to its own renovation. As no man must dishonour the work of our <hi>Creator;</hi> and therefore our facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>natural Freewill</hi> are not to be <hi>denyed</hi> or <hi>reproached:</hi> so must we be as careful that we dishonour not the works of our <hi>Redeemer</hi> or <hi>Sanctifier:</hi> and therefore the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:59347:67"/>
                        <hi>viciousness</hi> and <hi>ill disposedness</hi> of these faculties, and the <hi>thraldom</hi> of our <hi>wills</hi> to their <hi>own misinclinations,</hi> and to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence,</hi> must be confessed; and the <hi>need of Grace</hi> to work the cure. It is not ingenuous for us, when God made it <hi>so</hi> admirable a part of his work in the world, to <hi>Redeem</hi> us, and save us from our sin and misery, that we should <hi>hide</hi> or <hi>deny</hi> our diseases, and make our selves believe that we have but <hi>little need</hi> of the <hi>Physician,</hi> and so that the cure is <hi>no great matter,</hi> and consequently deserveth <hi>no great praise.</hi> I know the Church is troubled by men of dark yet self-conceited minds, that in these points are running all into extreams. One side denying the <hi>Sapiential method,</hi> and the other the <hi>Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tential way</hi> of God in our recovery. One plainly casting our <hi>sin</hi> and <hi>misery principally</hi> on God; and the other as plainly robbing the <hi>Redeemer</hi> and <hi>holy Spirit</hi> of the honour of our recovery. But it is the latter that my subject leadeth me now to speak to. I beseech you take heed of any conceit that would draw you to extenuate the honour of our <hi>Sanctifier.</hi> Dare you contend against the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> for the integrity of <hi>your natures,</hi> or the honour of your cure? surely he that hath <hi>felt the power</hi> of this <hi>renewing grace,</hi> and found how little of it was from himself, nay how much he was an enemy to it, will be less inclined to extenuate the praise of grace then <hi>unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced men</hi> will be. Because the case is very weighty, give me leave by way of Question to propound these considerations to you.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Quest.</hi> 1. Why is it think you that all must be <hi>Baptized</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Name of the <hi>Son</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> as well as of the Father? Doth it not imply that <hi>all</hi> have need of a <hi>Sanctifier,</hi> and must be engaged to that end in <hi>Covenant</hi> with the <hi>Sanctifier?</hi> I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose you know that it is not to a bare Profession of our belief of the <hi>Trinity</hi> of <hi>persons</hi> that we are baptized. It is <hi>our Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant entrance</hi> into our happy Relation to <hi>God the Father, Son and Holy Ghost,</hi> that is then celebrated. And therefore as <hi>Infants</hi> and <hi>all</hi> must be thus <hi>engaged</hi> to the <hi>Sanctifier,</hi> so all must acknowledge their necessity of this mercy, and the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of it. It is <hi>essential</hi> to our <hi>Christianity,</hi> that we value it, desire it and receive it. And therefore an error inconsistent with it proveth us indeed <hi>no Christians,</hi> Mat. 28. 19.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="103" facs="tcp:59347:67"/>
                        <hi>Quest.</hi> 2. Why is it think you that the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> and this <hi>renewing work,</hi> are so much magnified in the Scripture? Is not the glory of it answerable to those high expressions? undoubtedly it is. I have already told you elsewhere of the Elogies of this work. It is that by which <hi>Christ dwelleth in them,</hi> and they <hi>are made a habitation of God by the spirit,</hi> Eph. 3. 17. and 2. 22. They are made by it <hi>the Temples of the Holy Ghost,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 19. It is the <hi>Divine Power</hi> (which is no other then <hi>Omnipotency</hi>) that <hi>giveth us all things pertaining unto Life and Godliness,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 3. Think not I beseech you any lower of this work then is consistent with these expressions. It is the <hi>opening of the blind eyes of our understanding, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God,</hi> and bringing us <hi>into his marvellous light,</hi> Act. 26. 18. Eph. 1. 18. 1 Pet. 2. 9. It is an inward <hi>teaching of us by God,</hi> Joh. 6. 45. 1 Thes. 4. 9. an effectual <hi>teaching and anointing,</hi> 1 Joh. 2. 27. and a <hi>writing the Laws in our hearts and putting them in our inward parts,</hi> Heb. 8. 10, 11. I purposely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear any exposition of these texts, lest I seem to distort them; and because I would only lay the naked Word of God before your own impartial considerations. It is <hi>Gods work</hi> by the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and not <hi>our own as ours</hi> that is here so much magnified. And can all this signifie no more but a common <hi>bare proposal</hi> of <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>good</hi> to the <hi>intellect</hi> and <hi>will;</hi> even such as igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and wicked men have? Doth God do as much to illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate, teach, and sanctifie them that <hi>never are</hi> illuminated, or taught, and sanctified, as them that <hi>are?</hi> This work of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> is called a <hi>quickning,</hi> or making men that were dead, alive, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 1, 2. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 11, 13. It is called a <hi>new begetting</hi> or <hi>new birth,</hi> without which none can enter into heaven, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 3, 5, 6. A <hi>renewing us,</hi> and making us new men, and <hi>new creatures,</hi> so far as that <hi>old things are past away, and all become new,</hi> Eph. 4. 23, 24. Col. 3. 10. 2 Cor. 5. 17. It is a <hi>new creating us after the Image of God.</hi> Eph. 4. 24. It maketh <hi>us Holy as God is Holy,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 15, 16. yea it maketh us <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the Divine nature,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 4. It <hi>giveth us repentance to the acknowledging of the truth, that we may recover our selves out of the snare of the Devil, who were taken captive by him at his will,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 25, 26. It giveth us that <hi>Love by which
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:59347:68"/>
God dwelleth in us, and we in God,</hi> 1 Joh. 4. 16. We are <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed</hi> by Christ <hi>from all iniquity,</hi> and therefore it is that <hi>he gave himself for us, to purifie to himself a peculiar people zealous of good works,</hi> Tit. 2. 14. It is an <hi>abundant shedding of the Holy Ghost</hi> on us for our <hi>renovation,</hi> Tit. 3. 5, 6. and by it a <hi>shedding the Love of God abroad in our hearts,</hi> Rom. 5. 5. It is this <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> given to believers by which they <hi>pray,</hi> and by which they <hi>mortifie the flesh,</hi> Jud. 20. Rom. 8. 26. 13. By <hi>this Spirit</hi> we <hi>live,</hi> and <hi>walk,</hi> and <hi>rejoyce,</hi> Rom. 8. 1. and 14. 17. Our <hi>joy,</hi> and <hi>peace,</hi> and <hi>hope</hi> is through the power of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> Rom 15. 13. It giveth us a spiritual mind, and taketh away the <hi>carnal mind</hi> that is <hi>enmity against God,</hi> and <hi>neither is nor can be subject to his law,</hi> Rom. 8. 7. By this <hi>Spirit</hi> that is given to us, we must <hi>know that we are Gods children,</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 24. &amp; 4. 13. <hi>For if any man have not the spirit of Christ, the same is none of his,</hi> Rom. 8, 9. All holy graces are <hi>the fruits of the spirit,</hi> Gal. 5. 22, 23. It would be too long to number the several excellent effects of the <hi>sanctifying work</hi> of the <hi>spirit</hi> upon the soul, and to recite the Elogies of it in the Scripture. Surely it is no low or needless thing which all these expressions do intend.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Quest.</hi> 3. If you think it a most hainous sin to vilifie the <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator</hi> and <hi>his work,</hi> and the <hi>Redeemer</hi> and <hi>his work,</hi> why should not you think so of the vilifying of the <hi>sanctifier</hi> and <hi>his work,</hi> when God hath so magnified it, and will be glorified in it? and when it is the <hi>applying perfecting</hi> work, that maketh the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased benefits of Redemption to be ours, and formeth our Fathers Image on us.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Quest.</hi> 4. Do we not Doctrinally commit too much of that sin (if we undervalue the <hi>Spirits sanctifying work,</hi> as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon thing) which the <hi>ungodly world</hi> do manifest in <hi>practice,</hi> when they speak and live in a contempt or low esteem of grace? And which is more injurious to God? for a prophane person to jest at the Spirits work, or for a Christian or Minister deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berately to extennate it? especially when the <hi>preaching of grace</hi> is a Ministers chief work, sure we should much fear partaking in so great a sin.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Quest.</hi> 5. Why is it that the Scripture speaks so much to take men off from <hi>boasting</hi> or ascribing any thing to themselves?
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:59347:68"/>
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 19. <hi>That every mouth may be stopped;</hi> and why doth not the Law of works <hi>exclude boasting</hi> but only the <hi>Law of faith?</hi> Rom. 3. 27. Surely the actions of <hi>nature</hi> (except so far as it is corrupt) are as truly <hi>of God,</hi> as the acts of <hi>grace.</hi> And yet God will not take it well to deny him the glory of <hi>Redemption,</hi> or <hi>Sanctification,</hi> and tell him that we paid it him in <hi>another kind,</hi> and ascribed all to him as the author of our <hi>free will</hi> by <hi>natural production.</hi> For as <hi>Nature</hi> shall honour the <hi>Creatour,</hi> so <hi>Grace</hi> shall also honour the <hi>Redeemer</hi> and <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifier.</hi> And God designeth the <hi>humbling of the sinner,</hi> and teaching him to deny himself; and to honour God in such a way as may stand with <hi>self abasement,</hi> leaving it to God to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour those by way of <hi>reward,</hi> that honour him in way of <hi>du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and deny their <hi>own honour.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Quest.</hi> 6. Why is the <hi>Blaspheming,</hi> and sinning against the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> made so hainous and dangerous a sin, if the <hi>works of the Holy Ghost</hi> were not most excellent, and such as God will be most honoured by?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Quest.</hi> 7. Is it not exceeding ingratitude for the soul that hath been illuminated, converted, renewed, quickened and saved by the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> to extenuate the mercy, and ascribe it most to his natural Will? O what a change was it that San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification made? what a blessed birth day was that to our souls when we entered here upon Life Eternal! <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 3.

                     <p>

[<hi>It is God that worketh in you to Will and to do of his good pleasure</hi>] Eph. 2. 7, 8, 9, 10. <hi>God hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly places in Christ Jesus, that in the ages to come he might sh<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

Doth it not tend to bring <hi>sin into credit</hi> which <hi>holiness</hi> is contrary to, and to bring the love of God into dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit, and to hinder mens Conversion, and keep them from a holy life, when <hi>holiness</hi> is taken for so <hi>low</hi> and <hi>natural</hi> or <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> a thing?</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Quest.</hi> 12. Doth it not speak very dangerous suspicion of a soul that never felt the special work of grace, that can make light of it, and ascribe it most to his own will? And would not <hi>sound Humiliation</hi> do more then <hi>Arguments</hi> to cure this great mistake? I never yet came neer a throughly-humbled soul, but I found them too low and vile in their own eyes, to have such undervaluing thoughts of grace, or to think it best for them to leave all the efficacy of grace to their own wills! A broken heart abhors such thoughts.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Quest.</hi> 13. Dare any wise and sober man <hi>desire</hi> such a thing of God, or dare you say that you will <hi>expect no other Grace,</hi> but what shall leave it to your selves to make it effectual or fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate it?

                     <p>
                        <hi>Quest.</hi> 14. Do not the constant <hi>Prayers</hi> of all that have but a shew of godliness contradict the doctrine which I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting? Do you not beg of God to <hi>melt</hi> and <hi>soften</hi> and <hi>bow</hi> your hearts, and to make them more holy, and fill them with light, and faith, and Love, and hold you close to God and duty! In a word, do you not daily pray for effectual grace, that shall infallibly procure your desired ends? I scarce ever heard a <hi>prayer</hi> from a sober man but was orthodox in such points, though their speeches would be heterodox.</p>

                        <hi>Quest.</hi> 15. Do you not know that there is <hi>an enmity in every unrenewed heart against sanctification</hi> till God remove it? Are we not greater enemies to our selves, and greater resisters of the Holy Ghost, and of our own conversion and sanctification and salvation, then all the world besides is? woe to him that feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not this by himself. And is it likely that we that are ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to holiness should do more to our own Sanctification, then the Holy Ghost? Woe to us if <hi>he</hi> conquer not our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Quest.</hi> 16. Is it <hi>probable that so great a work</hi> as the destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:59347:70"/>
of our dearest sins, the setting our hearts and all our hopes on an Invisible glory, and delighting in the Lord, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saking all for him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> should come rather from the choice of a will that <hi>loveth</hi> those sins, and <hi>hateth</hi> that holy heavenly life, then from the spirit of Christ? sure this is much above us.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Quest.</hi> 17. Whence is it that so often one man that hath been a notorious sinner is Converted by a Sermon, when a civiler man, of better nature and life, is never changed though he have that and ten times more perswasions?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Quest.</hi> 18. Doth not experience tell impartial observers, that the high esteemers of the sanctifying work of the Holy Ghost, are ordinarily of <hi>more holy heavenly lives,</hi> then they that use to ascribe the differencing work to their free wills? In my ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation it is so.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Quest.</hi> 19. Should not every gracious <hi>humble</hi> soul, be more enclined to magnifie God then himself? and to give him the Glory, then to give it to our selves, especially in a case where Scripture and experience telleth us that we are more unlikely then God to deserve the praise? Our destruction is of our selves, but in him is our help, <hi>Hos.</hi> 13. 9. When we see an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and know it, and the causes that are in question, it is easie to conjecture from the quality which is the true cause. If I see a Serpent brought forth, I will sooner think that it was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated by a Serpent then a Dove. If I see sin in the world, I shall easily believe it is the spawn of this corrupted will, that is so prone to it. But if I find a divine nature in me, or see a holy heavenly life in any, I must needs think that this is liker to be the work of the blessed God, then of such a naughty heart as mans, that hath already been a self-destroyer.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Quest.</hi> 20. <hi>What motive</hi> hath any man to exalt himself, and sin again the Holy Ghost by such an extenuation of his saving grace? It is a <hi>causeless, fruitless sin.</hi> The only reason that ever I could hear for it, was, lest the doctrine of differencing grace should make God a respecter of persons, or the author of sin, of which there is no reason of a suspicion. We all agree that no man perisheth or is denyed Grace, but such as deserve it: And when all deserve it, it is no more respect of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in God to sanctifie some only of those ill deservers, then it is that he makes not all men Kings, nor every dog or toad
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:59347:70"/>
a man, nor every star a Sun, or every man or Angel. <hi>To clear all</hi> objections concerning this would be but to digress.</p>
                     <p>3. Lastly, Our knowledge of the Holy Ghost must raise us to an high estimation of his works, and a ready reception of his graces and cheerful obedience to his motions. He San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified our Head, that had no sin, by preventing sin in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, and he annointed him to his office, and came upon him at his Baptism: He Sanctified and anointed the Prophets and Apostles to their offices, and by them endited the holy Scripture. He illuminateth, converteth, sanctifieth and gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth all that are to be the heirs of life. This is his work. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour that part of it that is done on Christ, on the Prophets, Apostles, and the Scriptures; and value and seek after that which belongeth to your selves. Think not to be Holy with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Sanctifier, nor to do any thing well without the spirit of Jesus Christ, who is Christs internal invisible Agent here on earth (as <hi>Tertullian</hi> in the Churches Creed speaks, <hi>misit vicariam vim spiritus sancti qui credentes agat.</hi>) O that men knew how much of their well-fare dependeth on a faithful obeying of the Holy Ghost!</p>

                     <p>12. THe next part of our Knowledge of God is to know him in those great consequent Relations, to which he is entitled by Creation and Redemption, <hi>viz.</hi> as he is <hi>Our Absolute Lord,</hi> or <hi>Owner,</hi> our <hi>most Righteous Governour,</hi> and ou <hi>most Bountiful</hi> or <hi>Gracious Father</hi> or <hi>Benefactor.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>1. God both as our <hi>Creator</hi> and <hi>Redeemer</hi> hath <hi>Jus Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nii,</hi> an <hi>Absolute Dominion</hi> of the world; that is, He is <hi>our Owner</hi> or <hi>Proprietary,</hi> and we are <hi>his Own;</hi> For we take not the term [<hi>Lordship</hi> or <hi>Dominion</hi>] here in the <hi>looser</hi> sense as it signifieth a <hi>Ruler,</hi> but in the <hi>stricter</hi> sense as it signifieth an <hi>Owner.</hi> Of this Relation I have already spoken in a Sermon of [<hi>Christs Dominion:</hi>] and therefore shall say the less in this place.</p>
                     <p>The Knowledge of <hi>Gods Dominion</hi> or <hi>Propriety</hi> must com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:59347:71"/>
1. The certain truth of this his right; 2. The fulness of it. 3. The effects that it must have on us.</p>
                     <p>I. And the Truth of it is beyond dispute, even among <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels</hi> that know there is <hi>a God.</hi> He that <hi>made us</hi> of his own materials, or of <hi>nothing,</hi> must needs be the <hi>Owner</hi> of us; And so must he that <hi>Bought us</hi> from destruction. Ezek. 18. 4. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold all souls are Mine:</hi>] Rom. 14. 9. <hi>To this end Christ both dyed, rose and revived that he might be Lord both of the dead and living</hi>] Joh. 16. 14, 15. <hi>All things that the Father hath are Mine</hi>] The <hi>Father</hi> then hath this Propriety <hi>by Creation,</hi> and the <hi>son by Redemption:</hi> and the <hi>Father</hi> also by <hi>communication</hi> with the <hi>Son</hi> in <hi>Redemption;</hi> and the <hi>Son</hi> by <hi>communication</hi> with the Father in <hi>Creation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>II. And it must be the <hi>most Absolute Plenary</hi> Dominion, because the very <hi>Being</hi> of all the Creatures is from God, and therefore no one can be co-ordinate with him, or his corrival, nor any thing limit his Interest in us.</p>
                     <p>III. And the effects that this must have upon us, are these following.</p>
                     <p>1. Hence we must conclude and reverently and willingly consess that further then he voluntarily doth oblige himself to us, it is <hi>impossible</hi> that <hi>God</hi> should be <hi>our Debtor;</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that upon terms of <hi>commutative Justice</hi> we should <hi>Merit</hi> any thing of God. For what can we render to him but <hi>his Own?</hi> And how should he (properly and Antecedently) be indebted to and for <hi>his Own?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. And we must conclude, that (antecedently to his <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>promise) it is impossible that God can do us any wrong,</hi> or any thing that he can do can be <hi>guilty</hi> of <hi>injustice:</hi> For <hi>Justice</hi> giveth to all <hi>their Own;</hi> and therefore it giveth No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <hi>to us from God,</hi> but what he voluntarily <hi>giveth us himself,</hi> which therefore is <hi>first</hi> a <hi>gift of Bounty,</hi> and but secondarily a <hi>Due in Justice.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. And therefore we must hence learn, that <hi>God may do with his own as he list.</hi> And therefore we must take heed that we repine not at any of his <hi>Decrees</hi> or <hi>Providences,</hi> or any pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages concerning them in his word. Much may be <hi>above us,</hi> because our blindness cannot reach the reasons of his wayes; but nothing is <hi>unreasonable</hi> or <hi>evil;</hi> For all proceedeth from
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:59347:71"/>
                        <hi>Infinite Wisdom and Goodness,</hi> as well as from <hi>Omnipotency;</hi> As no man must <hi>feign</hi> any thing of God, and say [<hi>This is his Decree, or Word or Providence; and therefore it is good,</hi>] when there is no such thing <hi>revealed</hi> to us; so when we find that it is <hi>indeed Revealed,</hi> our Reason must presently submit, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly conclude it <hi>reasonable</hi> and <hi>good.</hi> Yet is there no cause from hence to fear, lest God should <hi>condemn the innocent,</hi> or break his <hi>promises,</hi> and deny us the <hi>reward;</hi> nor is there any hope to wicked men that he should violate his peremptory threatnings, or (as they call it in their selfish language) be better then his word: Because though God have an <hi>Absolute Propriety,</hi> and therefore in regard of his interest or Power, may do what he <hi>Will,</hi> yet he is <hi>essentially</hi> also most <hi>Wise</hi> and <hi>Good,</hi> and accordingly hath fitted all things to their use, and taken upon him the Relation of <hi>our Governour,</hi> and as it were obliged himself by his <hi>Laws and Covenants,</hi> and declared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be <hi>most Just;</hi> and shewed us hereby that he <hi>Will</hi> do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing contrary to these. As there is no contradiction, but most perfect <hi>Unity</hi> in <hi>Gods Omnipotency, Wisdom and Goodness;</hi> his <hi>Dominion</hi> or <hi>Propriety,</hi> his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and <hi>Paternity;</hi> so shall there be no contradiction, but a perfect Concord of all these in the <hi>exercise.</hi> He therefore that as <hi>our King</hi> or <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour,</hi> hath undertaken to advance the Godly, and destroy the wicked, will not by the exercise of his <hi>Absolute Dominion,</hi> deny himself, nor be unfaithful to his people or to his rules of Government.</p>
                     <p>If you ask me, in what cases then this <hi>Dominion</hi> is exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised? I answer, 1. In laying the <hi>Foundations</hi> of <hi>laws,</hi> and <hi>Right.</hi> 2. In the <hi>Disposal</hi> of the <hi>unreasonable Creatures.</hi> 3. In abundance of things about his <hi>Rational Creatures,</hi> wherein as <hi>Rector</hi> he is not engaged, nor hath in his <hi>Laws</hi> declared his will; (As about the various constitutions and complexions of men, their ranks and dignities in the world, their riches or poverty, their health, or sickness, their gifts and parts both natural and acquired; the first giving of the Gospel, and of special Grace, to such as had forfeited them, and had no promise of them: the degrees of outward means and mercies; the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of inward grace, more then what is promised, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>)</p>
                     <p>From hence also we must learn, not to repine at the <hi>provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences</hi>
                        <pb n="112" facs="tcp:59347:72"/>
of God about his <hi>Church,</hi> which are strange to us, and past our reach, and seem to make against it wellfare. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that as he may do with his own as he list, so we have no reason to think that he will be lavish or disregardful of his <hi>own.</hi> The Church is not <hi>ours</hi> but <hi>Gods:</hi> and therefore he is fitter then we to be trusted with it.</p>
                     <p>And so in our <hi>own</hi> distresses by affliction; when flesh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineth, let us remember, that we are his <hi>Own,</hi> and he may do with us as he please. If we be poor, despised, sick and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in the world, let us remember that as it is no injury to the <hi>beasts</hi> that they are not <hi>men,</hi> or to the <hi>worms</hi> that they are not <hi>beasts,</hi> or to the <hi>plants</hi> that they have not <hi>sense,</hi> or to the <hi>stars</hi> that they are not <hi>suns;</hi> so it is no <hi>wrong</hi> to the <hi>subjects</hi> that they are not <hi>Princes,</hi> or to the <hi>poor</hi> that they are not <hi>rich,</hi> or to the <hi>sick</hi> that they are not <hi>healthful.</hi> May not God do with <hi>his own, as he list?</hi> shall a <hi>Beggar</hi> grudge that you give not <hi>all</hi> that he desireth, when you are not bound to give him <hi>any thing?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>4. Yea hence we must learn to be the <hi>more Thankful for all our mercies,</hi> because they proceed from the <hi>Absolute Lord,</hi> that was not <hi>obliged</hi> to us. He might have made us <hi>Ideots,</hi> or <hi>mad men;</hi> he might have made us <hi>beasts</hi> or <hi>toads,</hi> without any injury to us; And the Mercies which are <hi>consequently</hi> from his <hi>Promise,</hi> are <hi>Antecedently</hi> from his <hi>Propriety and Dominion:</hi> For he might have put us into other capacities, and have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen not to have <hi>made</hi> those promises. And his <hi>promises</hi> bind us not to be <hi>less thankful</hi> but <hi>more.</hi> As his mercies are not the <hi>less mercies</hi> but the <hi>greater</hi> for being promised; because we have now the comfort and use of them in the promise, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we have them.</p>
                     <p>5. Hence also we must learn, that there can be <hi>no simple ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Propriety in any Creature.</hi> No creature gave all the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>well being</hi> to another that it hath, and this originally as of its <hi>Own.</hi> We being not our <hi>Own</hi> but <hi>God's,</hi> cannot have any thing that is <hi>Absolutely our Own. Humane Propriety</hi> is but derived<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <hi>limited,</hi> and <hi>respective.</hi> Our <hi>Goods,</hi> and <hi>Lands,</hi> and <hi>Lives</hi> are <hi>Ours;</hi> that is, they are <hi>Ours</hi> to <hi>Use for God,</hi> as the <hi>Instruments</hi> of a workman to do his work; but not <hi>ours</hi> to use as we think meet. They are so <hi>ours</hi> as that <hi>men</hi> may not
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:59347:72"/>
take them from us, but <hi>God</hi> may take them from us at his pleasure. And therefore think not you may mispend a penny if you were never so rich, because it is <hi>your own;</hi> but know that you must mispend nothing, because it is <hi>not your own,</hi> but Gods.</p>
                     <p>6. Principally we must hence learn to <hi>Deny our selves as being not our own, and having nothing in the world that is our Own, in respect to God, the absolute Owner.</hi> And therefore above all the sins of your souls, still watch against this <hi>selfish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:</hi> lest you should grow to look at your <hi>Time,</hi> your <hi>Strength,</hi> your <hi>Wealth,</hi> your <hi>Interests</hi> as <hi>your own,</hi> and forget that you are <hi>meer stewards;</hi> and say as the ungodly, <hi>Psal.</hi> 12. 4. [<hi>Our lips are our own: Who is Lord over us!</hi>] O take heed that you use not your strength, or interest, or any thing <hi>for your selves:</hi> no not so much as your food and rayment, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 31. that is, <hi>for your selves ultimately,</hi> or not in <hi>subordination to the Lord.</hi> For <hi>self</hi> as <hi>subject unto God,</hi> or as closed with him in the bond of <hi>Love,</hi> is no longer <hi>self in enmity</hi> and <hi>opposition,</hi> nor that which we are forbidden to seek or serve.</p>
                     <p>7. And this Knowledge of the <hi>Dominion</hi> of <hi>God</hi> must pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with us effectually to <hi>Resign our selves absolutely to him.</hi> Our <hi>consent</hi> doth give him <hi>no title</hi> to us, but it is necessary to <hi>our well-fare</hi> that we confess <hi>his title. All men,</hi> even the <hi>wicked</hi> are his <hi>Own:</hi> but that is <hi>against their wills:</hi> but the godly are <hi>willingly his Own,</hi> and disclaim all interest in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves but what is duely subordinate to his: The name of God is put upon them, as you put your names on your goods or sheep. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 8. <hi>I sware unto thee, and entered into a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with thee, saith the Lord, and thou becamest mine</hi>] Mal. 3. 17. [<hi>And they shall be mine saith the Lord in that day when I make up my jewels</hi>] To be <hi>entirely his by Covenant</hi> is proper to a <hi>Saint:</hi> For <hi>sanctification</hi> hath these parts; one is <hi>the habitual devotion of the soul to God,</hi> and the other is <hi>the actual dedication,</hi> and a third is <hi>the relation of the person as thus dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated,</hi> and the fourth is the <hi>actual using of our selves for God.</hi> These four are the parts of Sanctification; so that all is but our <hi>Giving up our selves to God.</hi> But to be his in <hi>Right</hi> is common to the <hi>Devils</hi> and most ungodly. The hearts of the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:59347:73"/>
sanctified do resolvedly and delightfully say [<hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 16. <hi>My beloved is mine, and I am his</hi>] and 6. 3. [<hi>I am my beloveds, and my beloved is mine</hi>] See then that you keep not any thing back, but resign up your selves entirely to God, as those that know they are <hi>wholly his.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>8. And with our selves we must resign up <hi>all to God that we have.</hi> For if <hi>we</hi> are <hi>not our own</hi> but <hi>His,</hi> then our <hi>children,</hi> our <hi>wealth,</hi> our <hi>wits,</hi> our <hi>time,</hi> our <hi>abilities</hi> and all that we have are <hi>his.</hi> All is not to be <hi>used one way</hi> for God: not <hi>all</hi> to the <hi>poor,</hi> nor <hi>all</hi> to the <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> nor <hi>all</hi> to the direct pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting of his <hi>worship:</hi> but <hi>all</hi> must be <hi>his,</hi> and used for <hi>him,</hi> in one way or other, and in those wayes which he requireth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Possess not any thing <hi>meerly for your selves.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>9. And especially see to it in the <hi>use and improvement,</hi> that you <hi>use</hi> your <hi>selves</hi> and all that you have for God. Let this be your <hi>intention, trade</hi> and <hi>study.</hi> See that you be alwayes <hi>at his work;</hi> that if a man come in upon you any hour of the day, and ask you what you are doing, and <hi>whose work</hi> it is that you are upon, you may truly be able to say, <hi>the Lords.</hi> If you be asked, who you are now speaking for, or spending your time for, or for whom you do expend your wealth?] you may truly say of every hour, and every penny, and every word, [<hi>It is for the Lord.</hi>] Even that which you give your children or friends, and that which you receive for your support or comfort, may all be principally and ultimately for God: [Ye are not your own; for ye are bought with a price: therefore glorifie God in your body, and in your spirit, which are Gods] 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 19, 20. [<hi>Christ dyed for all, that they which live, should not henceforth live unto themselves, but to him that dyed for them, and rose again,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 15.</p>
                     <p>10. Lastly, <hi>This must be a stay to the souls of true believers, and cause them with comfort to trust themselves and all their affairs in the hands of God.</hi> When we have first made it our care to <hi>give to God the things that are God's,</hi> Mat. 22. 21. and heartily consecrated <hi>our selves</hi> and <hi>all that we have</hi> to him as his <hi>own;</hi> we have no reason to doubt of <hi>his acceptance,</hi> nor of his <hi>care</hi> and <hi>protection</hi> and <hi>merciful disposal</hi> of us. This is a wonderful comfort to poor Christians, to think that they have such <hi>an Owner.</hi> Whoever is against you Christians, be sure
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:59347:73"/>
of it God will look to you, as <hi>his own!</hi> And if you do but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise another that you will be as careful of <hi>his child, his horse, his goods,</hi> as if they were <hi>your own,</hi> he will think you say as much as can be expected. If you be poor, or sick, or desolate, you may be sure that yet God will look to you as <hi>his own.</hi> And why should you think he will be careless of <hi>his own?</hi> Ground your prayers and confidence on this, as <hi>David</hi> doth, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 94. <hi>I am thine, save me.</hi>] And in all our labours and the affairs of our lives, when our consciences can say that we <hi>live to God,</hi> and study to do all we do <hi>for him,</hi> and to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove all our time and parts and other talents to <hi>his use,</hi> it may very much quiet us in all his disposals of us. If he keep us in the lowest case, if we be <hi>his,</hi> we must rest in his wisdom, that knows best how to <hi>use his own.</hi> If he take our <hi>friends</hi> from us, he taketh but <hi>his own.</hi> If he deny his saving grace to our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly children (a heavy judgement of which we must be sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible) yet when we have devoted them to God, and done our own part, we must be silent as <hi>Aaron</hi> was when his sons were destroyed, <hi>Lev.</hi> 10. 3. and confess that the <hi>Potter hath power over his own clay, to make of the same lump ae vessel to honour and another to dishonour,</hi> Rom. 9. 21. All his disposals shall work to that end which is the most <hi>universal perfect good,</hi> and most denominateth all the means. But those that are <hi>his own</hi> by <hi>consent</hi> and <hi>Covenant</hi> may be sure that all shall work to their <hi>own good.</hi> Let us die with Christ, and be buried to the world, and know <hi>no Lord</hi> or <hi>Owner</hi> but our great <hi>Creatour</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer</hi> (except in a limited subservient sense) and then we may boldly argue with him to the quiet of our souls from this <hi>Relation [I am thine, help me</hi>] Psal. 35. 23. <hi>Stir up thy self and awake to my judgement, even to my cause, my Lord and my God] when faith and love have first said as</hi> Thomas [<hi>my Lord and my God</hi>] Joh. 20. 28.</p>

                     <p>13. THE next Relation to be spoken of, is <hi>Gods soveraignty:</hi> both by <hi>Creation</hi> and <hi>Redemption,</hi> he hath the <hi>Right</hi> of <hi>Governing</hi> us as our <hi>Soveraign King,</hi> and we are <hi>obliged</hi> to be

his <hi>willing subjects,</hi> and <hi>as such to obey his holy laws.</hi> He is the <hi>Lord</hi> or <hi>Owner</hi> of <hi>all the world;</hi> even of <hi>Brutes</hi> as properly as of <hi>Man:</hi> But he is the <hi>Soveraign King or Governour</hi> only of the <hi>Reasonable Creature;</hi> because no other are capable of that proper <hi>Moral Government</hi> which now we speak of. Vulgarly indeed his <hi>Physical motions</hi> and <hi>dispositions</hi> are called his <hi>Rule or Government:</hi> and so God is said to <hi>Govern Brutes</hi> and inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate creatures: but that is but a <hi>Metaphorical</hi> expression: as an Artificer <hi>Metaphorically</hi> Governeth his <hi>clock</hi> or <hi>engine,</hi> or a <hi>Shepheard</hi> his <hi>sheep.</hi> But we now speak of <hi>proper moral Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> God having made <hi>man a Rational and free agent having an immortal soul, and capable of everlasting happiness,</hi> his very <hi>nature</hi> and the <hi>end</hi> of his <hi>creation</hi> required, that he should be conducted to that <hi>end</hi> and <hi>happiness</hi> by <hi>means</hi> agreeable to his nature: that is, by the <hi>Revelation of the Reward</hi> before he <hi>seeth</hi> it, that he may <hi>seek</hi> it and be <hi>fitted</hi> for it: and by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed duties that are necessary to obtain it, and to his living here according to his nature: and by <hi>threatned penalties</hi> to quicken him to his <hi>duty:</hi> so that he is <hi>naturally</hi> a creature to be <hi>Governed,</hi> both as <hi>sociable,</hi> and as one to be conducted to <hi>his end.</hi> He therefore that created him having alone both <hi>sufficiency</hi> and <hi>Right,</hi> doth by this very <hi>Creation</hi> become his <hi>Governour.</hi> His <hi>Government</hi> hath two parts (the world being thus <hi>constituted the Kingdom of God</hi>) The first is by <hi>Legislation,</hi> or making <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Officers</hi> for execution. The second is by the procuring the <hi>execution</hi> of these Laws: To which end he doth <hi>exhort</hi> and <hi>perswade</hi> the <hi>subjects</hi> to <hi>obedience,</hi> and <hi>judge them</hi> according to their works, and <hi>execute</hi> his <hi>judgement.</hi> His <hi>first Law</hi> was to <hi>Adam,</hi> the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> obliging him to adhere to his <hi>Creator,</hi> and to <hi>love him, trust him, fear him, honour him,</hi> and <hi>obey</hi> him with all his might, in order to the pleasing of his Creator and the attainment of everlasting life: To which was added a positive Law, against the eating of the tree of Knowledge: and <hi>Death</hi> was the penalty due to the sinner: This Law was quickly broken by man; and God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed not his judgement, but sentenced the <hi>Tempter,</hi> the <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> and the <hi>Man:</hi> but not according to their merits: but graciously providing a <hi>Redeemer,</hi> he presently stopt the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the far greatest part of the penalty, the Son of God
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:59347:74"/>
undertaking as our surety to become a <hi>sacrifice</hi> and <hi>ransome</hi> for us. Hereupon the <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> was made, and the <hi>Law of Grace</hi> enacted with mankind: but more obscurely in the beginning; being cleared up by degrees in the several Promises to the Fathers, the types of the Law, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies of the Prophets of several ages, the Law being inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed because of transgression: In the fulness of time the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah was incarnate, and the first promises concerning him ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, and after his holy life, and preachings, and conquests of the Tempter and the world, he gave himself a Ransome for us, and conquering Death he Rose again, ascended into Heaven, being possessed in his manhood of the fulness of his power, and all things being delivered into his hands; so that he was made the <hi>General Administrator,</hi> and <hi>Lord of all.</hi> And thus he more clearly revealing his <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> and bringing <hi>life and immortality to light,</hi> commissioned his <hi>Ministers</hi> to <hi>preach this Gospel to all the world.</hi> And thus the <hi>Primitive Soveraign</hi> is <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>Soveraign by Derivation is Jesus the Mediator</hi> in his manhood united to the second person in the Godhead; and the Laws that we are governed by, are the <hi>Law of Nature</hi> with the superadded <hi>Covenant of Grace;</hi> the subordinate officers are Angels, Magistrates, and Pastors of the Church (having works distinct) the society it self is called the Church and Kingdom of God; the <hi>Reward</hi> is <hi>everlasting glory,</hi> with the mercies of this life in order to it: and the <hi>Punishment</hi> is <hi>everlasting misery</hi> with the preparatory judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, especially on the soul, which are here inflicted. <hi>Subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> is <hi>due</hi> upon our <hi>first being;</hi> and is <hi>consented</hi> to or <hi>vowed</hi> in <hi>Baptisme,</hi> and is to be <hi>manifested</hi> in <hi>holy obedience</hi> to the death. This is the <hi>Soveraignty and Government</hi> of God. And now let us see how God as our Soveraign must be <hi>known.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>1. The Princes, and all the Rulers of the world, must un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand their <hi>Place</hi> and <hi>Duty:</hi> They are <hi>first Gods subjects,</hi> and then <hi>his officers,</hi> and can have <hi>no power but from God,</hi> Rom. 13. 3, 4. nor hold any but in <hi>dependance</hi> on him, and subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination to him. Their <hi>power</hi> extendeth no further then the <hi>Heavenly Soveraign</hi> hath signified his <hi>pleasure,</hi> and by <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to them,</hi> or <hi>command to us,</hi> conferred it on them. As they have <hi>no strength</hi> (or <hi>natural power</hi>) but from the <hi>Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:59347:75"/>
God,</hi> so can they have no <hi>Authority</hi> (or <hi>Governing Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer</hi> or <hi>Right</hi>) but from the <hi>Absolute King</hi> of all the world. They can less pretend to a <hi>Right</hi> of <hi>Governing</hi> not derived from God, then a <hi>Justice</hi> or <hi>Constable</hi> may to such <hi>Power</hi> not derived from the <hi>earthly soveraigns.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Princes and States also must hence understand their <hi>End and Work.</hi> God who is the <hi>Beginning,</hi> must be the <hi>End</hi> also of their <hi>Government:</hi> Their <hi>Laws</hi> must be but <hi>by Laws subser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient to his Laws,</hi> to further mens obedience to them. The <hi>Common Good,</hi> which is their <hi>lower nearer End,</hi> must be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured by <hi>his Interest</hi> in the Nations, and mens Relations un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>him.</hi> The Common possession of his favour, blessing and protection, is the greatest <hi>Common Good.</hi> His Interest in us, and ours in him, must therefore be principally maintained.</p>
                     <p>2. The <hi>Knowledge of God</hi> as <hi>our Soveraign King, must bring the whole man in subjection to him.</hi> Our <hi>Understaendings</hi> must be subject to his Doctrine; and resigned to him, as teachable and tractable: When we know what is <hi>his Law and Will,</hi> we must rest in it, though we know not the Reasons of it. We take not on us to be competent Judges of all the <hi>Reasons</hi> of the <hi>Laws of men,</hi> but must obey them without disputing the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons (with the limitations after to be mentioned.) How much more must we submit to the wisdome of the Infallible Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver, that cannot deceive, or be deceived! Our Wills also must be fully subject to his Will, revealed by his Precepts. We must desire no more to move us, or to stop us, but to know what God would have us do. As the first wheels in a watch or other engine moveth all the rest, so the Will of God must move all our Wills, and Rule our Lives. We must take heed above all things in the world, lest our Wills (which are the <hi>lower Wheels</hi>) should have any such defects, distempers, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves, any carnal byas, interest, or inclination, that makes them unfit to receive the <hi>Law of God,</hi> or be <hi>Ruled</hi> by <hi>his Will.</hi> We must imitate our Lord (<hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 7.) and learn of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>Psal.</hi> 40. 8. [<hi>I delight to do thy Will, O God.</hi>] With chearful readiness to obey, we must stand <hi>waiting</hi> for the word of his Command; and say as <hi>Psal.</hi> 143. 10. <hi>Teach mee to do thy Will, for thou art my God:</hi>] And as <hi>Samuel,</hi> (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 9.) <hi>Speak Lord, for thy Servaent heareth.</hi>] When a
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:59347:75"/>
mans <hi>selfish carnal Will</hi> is <hi>mortified,</hi> and his Will lies flat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, and wholly applieth it self to <hi>his Will,</hi> and it is enough to a man to move him in the greatest matters, to know that it is the <hi>Will of God,</hi> this is a state of true subjection. Thus must we be <hi>in subjection to the Father of Spirits,</hi> submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting even to his sharpest dispensations, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 9. And all the Church is <hi>subject</hi> unto Christ, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 24. And this is <hi>essential</hi> to our holy <hi>Covenant</hi> and <hi>Christianity</hi> it self. When God is taken to be <hi>our God,</hi> and we <hi>give up our selves</hi> to be <hi>his People;</hi> when Christ is taken to be <hi>our Saviour,</hi> and we <hi>give up our selves to him</hi> as his members, and redeemed ones, it essentially containeth our <hi>taking him for our chief Governour, and giving up our selves to him as his subjects.</hi> Take heed of that <hi>wisdome</hi> that would overtop the Wisdome of God, and be your Guide itself, without depending on <hi>his Wisdome.</hi> This is the foolish damning Wisdome of the World. Take heed of that <hi>Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence</hi> or <hi>Will</hi> that would be <hi>your Ruler,</hi> and overtop the <hi>Will of God.</hi> For this is the <hi>grand Rebel,</hi> and greatest Enemy of God and Us.</p>
                     <p>3. And <hi>Subjection</hi> must produce <hi>Obedience; Subjection</hi> is the <hi>Consent of the Will to be Subjects, and to Obey: Obedience</hi> is <hi>the actual performance of Commanded duties. Subjection</hi> is the root of <hi>Obedience,</hi> and <hi>Virtually</hi> containeth it: <hi>Obedience</hi> is the fruit of <hi>subjection,</hi> and <hi>supposeth</hi> it. If God be your <hi>Master,</hi> shew it by his fear, or service: <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 6. It is not <hi>calling Christ our King,</hi> but <hi>obeying him before all,</hi> that will prove us <hi>subjects.</hi> Mat. 7. 21. [<hi>Not every one that saith unto mee, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the Kingdome of Heaven: but he that doth the Will of my Father which is in Heaven.</hi>] Rom. 12. 1, 2. [<hi>I beseech you therefore Brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, your Reasonable service: and be not conformed to this world; but be you transformed</hi> (or turned into other men) <hi>by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good, that accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and perfect Will of God.] [And this is the Will of God, even your sanctification</hi>] 1 Thes. 4. 3. 1 Pet. 4. 1, 2. [<hi>Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm your selves likewise with the same mind: For he that hath suffered in the flesh, hath ceased from sin: that he no longer should live the rest of
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:59347:76"/>
his time in the flesh, to the lusts of men, but to the Will of God</hi>] Yea we should [<hi>stand perfect and compleat in all the Will of God,</hi> Col. 4. 12.] And by the power of the <hi>Word</hi> of God, <hi>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thought should be brought in obedience unto Christ</hi>] 2 Cor. 10. 5. Our obedience should be <hi>publick</hi> and <hi>exemplary,</hi> Rom. 16. 19. [<hi>For so is the Will of God, that with well doing we put to si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence the ignorance of foolish men</hi>] 1 Pet. 2. 15. <hi>Obedience is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than sacrifice,</hi> 1 Sam. 15. 22. Whatever you do, therefore keep close to the Law of God.</p>
                     <p>4. To this end <hi>we must labour to know the Law, and be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with Gods Will.</hi> The book of <hi>Nature</hi> must be studied: the <hi>holy Scripture</hi> must be <hi>searched,</hi> Joh 5. 39. <hi>and meditated in both day and night,</hi> Psal. 1. 2. Princes must have this Book <hi>continually in their hands,</hi> Deut. 17. 18, 19, 20. Josh. 1. 8, 9. Rich and poor must learn it, that they may Obey it, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 6, 7.</p>
                     <p>5. And our <hi>subjection to God obligeth us to a subjection to the Officers that he sets over us.</hi> If any man say to Judges, Justices and Constables [<hi>I will obey the King, but you are not Kings, therefore I will not obey you</hi>] he shall suffer as <hi>disobeying the King</hi> in his <hi>Officers.</hi> Contempt of <hi>Magistrates and Ministers</hi> reflects on <hi>God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>6. Yea hence we must practically understand, in <hi>what respect to obey our Governours:</hi> Not meerly as the <hi>Officers of men:</hi> not only as <hi>chosen by the people;</hi> but as the <hi>Officers of God,</hi> that <hi>from him</hi> have their <hi>Authority.</hi> The Atheistical Politicians that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive <hi>Authority</hi> no higher than the <hi>Sword,</hi> or the <hi>Peoples choice,</hi> or <hi>natural strength,</hi> do teach men to obey their Governours, but as a <hi>little Dog</hi> submits unto a <hi>Mastiff,</hi> or so far as <hi>their Commodity</hi> perswadeth them, but not for <hi>conscience in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to God.</hi> And they teach men to look to no higher end than common preservation and liberties, and not to expect protection or reward from the absolute Soveraign. In a word, they entice all Princes and people into damnable rebellion against the Lord; as much as if they should entice all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stables and Justices to hold their places without dependence on the Prince. But God teacheth us that [<hi>there is no Power but of God: the Powers that be are ordained of God: Whosoever there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and they
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:59347:76"/>
that resist, shall receive to themselves damnation; For he is the Minister of God to us for good; even the Minister of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> an avenger to execute wrath upon him that doth evil.</hi>] Rom. 13. 1, 2, 4. [<hi>Wherefore we must needs be subject not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake</hi>—[<hi>For they are Gods Ministers, continually attending upon this very thing: and for this cause we must pay them tribute</hi>] vers. 5, 6. [<hi>Submit your selves to every ordinance of man for the Lords sake,—For so is the will of God</hi>—1 Pet. 2. 13, 15. Deut. 1. 16, 17. [<hi>Judge righteously between every man and his brother—ye shall not respect persons in judgement, but shall hear the small as well as the great, you shall not be afraid of the face of man: for the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is Gods,</hi>] 2 Chron. 19 5, 6, 7. [<hi>And he said to the Judges, Take heed what ye do; for you judge not for man, but for the Lord, who is with you in the judgement; wherefore let the fear of the Lord be upon you</hi>] But our <hi>Atheistical Politicians</hi> would teach Rulers that they are none of the Ministers of God, and that they judge for <hi>man</hi> only and not for <hi>him.</hi> The nature of all true obedience is such as <hi>Paul</hi> describeth in children and servants, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 1, 6, 7, 8. that setcheth its rise and motives from the Lord [<hi>Children obey your Parents in the Lord, for this is right—Servants be obedient to them that are your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ: not with eye-service as men-pleasers, but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart; with good-will doing service as to the Lord and not to men</hi>] So <hi>Colos.</hi> 3. 22, 23.</p>
                     <p>7. Hence also you must learn, that <hi>Gods authority is the highest authority, and there is indeed no such thing in the world as true authority that is against him, or not subordinate unto him:</hi> And therefore if men command us to <hi>disobey God,</hi> by neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which is <hi>hic &amp; nunc</hi> a duty, or by sinning against him, their commands are from a disobedient will of their own, but from no <hi>Authority:</hi> and it is better in such cases to <hi>obey God</hi> then <hi>man,</hi> Act. 5. 29. so many Prophets, Apostles and other Martyrs, would not have been sacrificed by the fury of Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors, if they had thought it just to <hi>obey them before God. God</hi> never gave any man <hi>Authority against him</hi>] Nor to nullifie his laws. The acts of a Justice or Constable <hi>against the King,</hi>
                        <pb n="122" facs="tcp:59347:77"/>
or beyond their power, are private or rebellious acts, and not <hi>Authoritative.</hi> And so are the Laws of men that are <hi>against God.</hi> Yet note well, that though we must rather <hi>disobey men,</hi> then <hi>God,</hi> yet we may not forcibly <hi>Resist,</hi> when we <hi>may not obey them.</hi> And in some cases (as if a <hi>King</hi> would ravish a woman, or the like) when <hi>it is lawful to Resist his fact,</hi> it is not lawful to <hi>Resist his State,</hi> and disturb the Government of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth: Obey men chearfully when God forbids it not: but see that God be your <hi>Absolute Soveraign,</hi> whose Laws can be <hi>dispensed with</hi> by <hi>none.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If Parents or Masters command you to break the Laws of God, obey them not. <hi>Despise them not,</hi> but humbly deprecate their displeasure, and obey them in <hi>all other things;</hi> but in the <hi>unlawful thing</hi> obey them not: no not if they were the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Princes upon earth. But say as the three witnesses of God, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. 16, 17. [<hi>We are not careful to answer thee in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of thy hands O King: But if not, be it known unto thee O King, that we will not serve thy Gods, nor worship thy golden Image which thou hast set up.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>What I have said of Magistrates, in the two last cases, I mean also of <hi>Pastours of the Church.</hi> They must be <hi>obeyed in and for the Lord;</hi> but not <hi>against the Lord.</hi> Saith <hi>Paul</hi> of the Churches of <hi>Mace<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>onia,</hi> 2 Cor. 8. 5. [<hi>They gave their own selves to the Lord, and unto us, by the will of God</hi>] See <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 28. 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5. 12. <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. 16. <hi>He that heareth you heareth me, and he that despiseth you despiseth me.</hi>] And yet the <hi>leaven of the Pharisees</hi> must be avoided: and <hi>an Angel from Heaven be held as accursed if he should preach another Gospel,</hi> Gal. 1. 8. And I would not have flatterers to set either <hi>Princes</hi> or <hi>Pastours</hi> above the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of Heaven.</hi> Though yet in <hi>other respects</hi> we may be still obliged, as I said before, to hear and to obey them.</p>
                     <p>8. And the Knowledge of Gods <hi>soveraignty,</hi> must teach <hi>us to fear his righteous Threatnings, and reverence his Justice, and prepare our selves to be judged by him.</hi> He ruleth by his Laws, and so by <hi>Threatnings and Promises,</hi> which he will make good. It is not a painted fire that he Threatneth. <hi>Judgement</hi> is a part of <hi>Government. Laws</hi> are but shadows if there be no <hi>execution</hi>
                        <pb n="123" facs="tcp:59347:77"/>
[<hi>O worship the Lord in the beauty of Holiness; fear before him all the earth. Say among the Heathen that the Lord reigneth</hi>—] Psal. 96. 9, 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> As his <hi>promises,</hi> so his <hi>peremptory threatnings shall be fulfilled.</hi> He will not revoke his stablished Laws for fear of hurting willful sinners, that will not <hi>fear</hi> his judgements till they <hi>feel</hi> them, [<hi>Psal.</hi> 33. 8. <hi>Let all the earth fear the Lord, let all the inhabitants of the world stand in aw of him: for he spake and it was done; he commanded and it stood fast.</hi>] Mark also the <hi>present</hi> judgements of the Lord, and rush not on his indignation. For <hi>the Lord is known by the judgements which he executeth: the wicked is</hi> (oft) <hi>snared in the work of his own hands</hi>] Psal. 9. 16. Though [<hi>the wicked contemn God, and say in his heart, Thou wilt not require it</hi>] Psal. 10. 13.) yet they shall find that [<hi>he beholdeth mischief to requite it with his hand, and that he is the helper of the fatherless and poor that commit themselves unto him,</hi> ver. 14. [<hi>The Lords throne is in heaven: his eyes behold, his eyelids try the children of men: the Lord tryeth the Righteous, but the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth,</hi> Psal. 11. 4, 5.</p>
                     <p>9. The <hi>Soveraignty of God</hi> is a <hi>comfort to his loyal subjects.</hi> They may be sure that he will protect them, and make good his word. <hi>Behold he cometh, and his reward is with him,</hi> Rev. 22. 12. <hi>The righteous Judge at his appearing will give the Crown of Righteousness</hi> to all them that <hi>love his appearing,</hi> 2 Tim. 4. 18<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 7, 8. [<hi>O let the Nations be glad and sing for joy, for thou shalt judge the people righteously, and govern the Nations upon earth</hi>] Psal. 67. 4. [<hi>Let the Heavens rejoyce, and the earth be glad—before the Lord; for he cometh, for he cometh to judge the world with righteousness and the people with his truth,</hi>] Psal. 69. 11. 13.</p>
                     <p>10. Lastly, the Knowledge of God as our <hi>Soveraign King,</hi> must cause us <hi>to desire and pray for and promote the glory of his Kingdome,</hi> and the obedience of his subjects in the world, that <hi>his Name may be hallowed,</hi> by the <hi>coming of his Kingdom,</hi> and the <hi>doing of his will on earth as it is in Heaven,</hi> must be the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of our daily requests to God. It must be the grief of every subject of the Lord, to think of the Heathen and Infidel parts of the world; and to see the Rebellion of the Prophane among us; and that the Laws of God are <hi>unknown</hi> or <hi>despised</hi> by the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:59347:78"/>
most of men. Alas what abundance are ruled by their lusts, and self-conceitedness, and corrupted wills, and the customs of the world, or the wills of men! but how few are Ruled by the Laws of God! O how should it grieve an honest heart, to see <hi>Gods Kingdom</hi> hindered by <hi>Infidelity,</hi> and weakned, divided and disturbed by Popery, and Heresie, and dishonoured by scandal and impiety, as it is! And to see the multitude, and the violence and industry of corrupters, dividers and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyers: and the fewness, the coldness, and remisness of the builders, the healers and restorers! All you that are loyal subjects to your Lord, lament these waies of Rebellion and Disobedience, and the diminutions and distempers of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of his Kingdom, and the unfaithfulness and negligence of his Ministers: and bend your cares, desires and prayers to the promoting of Gods Kingdom in you, and in the world; and befriend not any thing that hindereth its prosperity.</p>

                     <p>14. THE third of these <hi>Relations,</hi> and the next point in the Knowledge of God to be spoken of, is, that he is [<hi>Our must Loving Father,</hi> or <hi>Bountiful Benefactor</hi>] As he is <hi>Good,</hi> so he <hi>doth Good,</hi> Psal. 119. 68. And as he is <hi>the chiefest Good,</hi> so he bestoweth the <hi>greatest Benefits:</hi> and therefore is thence by a Necessary Resultancy, our <hi>Most Bountiful Benefactor.</hi> The term [<hi>Father</hi>] comprehendeth in it all his three great <hi>Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> to us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1. A <hi>Father</hi> gives <hi>Being</hi> to his <hi>Children,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath some <hi>Propriety</hi> in them; and God is the <hi>first cause<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> our whole <hi>Being,</hi> and therefore we are <hi>his Own.</hi> 2. A <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> is the <hi>Governour</hi> of his <hi>Children:</hi> and God is our <hi>Chief Governour.</hi> 3. A <hi>Father</hi> tenderly <hi>Loveth</hi> his <hi>Children</hi> that are <hi>childlike,</hi> loving and obedient to him; and seeketh their felicity: and so doth <hi>God Love,</hi> and will make <hi>Happy</hi> his loving and obedient children, who have not only their <hi>Being</hi> from him as their <hi>Maker,</hi> but their <hi>New being</hi> or <hi>Holy nature</hi> from him as their <hi>Sanctifier.</hi> And this last being the <hi>end</hi> and <hi>perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> of the rest, doth communicate its nature to the rest as the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:59347:78"/>
                        <hi>Means.</hi> And so, 1. The <hi>new nature</hi> that God thus giveth us in our <hi>Regeneration,</hi> is not from his <hi>common Love,</hi> but is an act of <hi>special Grace,</hi> proceeding from his <hi>special Fatherly Love.</hi> 2. The <hi>Government</hi> that he exerciseth over them as his <hi>Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate children,</hi> is not a <hi>Common Government,</hi> such as is that of the meer Law of Nature or of works; but it is a <hi>special Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi> by a <hi>Law of Grace,</hi> a <hi>Justifying, Remedying, Saving Law,</hi> or <hi>Covenant;</hi> together with an internal illuminating, quickning, guiding spirit, with Church-state, and Officers and Ordinance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all suited to this way of Grace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Even as his <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion</hi> or <hi>Propriety</hi> by <hi>Redemption,</hi> and our <hi>Sanctification</hi> and <hi>Resignation,</hi> is not a <hi>Common Propriety,</hi> but a gracious Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to us as <hi>Our Own Father,</hi> who have the endeared Relation to him of being his <hi>Own Children.</hi> All is <hi>from Love<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> and <hi>in a way of Love,</hi> and for the exercise and <hi>demonstration of Love:</hi> so that when I call God [<hi>Our Benefactor</hi>] I precisely distinguish this last part of his Relations to us, from the rest: But when I call him [<hi>a Father</hi>] I mean the same <hi>thing,</hi> or <hi>Relation</hi> which a <hi>Benefactor</hi> signifieth; but with fuller aspect on the foregoing Relations, and <hi>connotation</hi> of them as they are <hi>perfected all in this.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And here I. I shall briefly name the <hi>Benefits</hi> on which this Relation of God is founded. And 1. Even in <hi>Creating</hi> us, he acted as a <hi>Benefactor,</hi> giving us the <hi>Fundamental Good</hi> of <hi>Being,</hi> and the excellency of <hi>manhood.</hi> 2. By setting us in a <hi>well furnished world,</hi> and putting all things <hi>under our feet,</hi> and giving us the use of Creatures. 3. By entering into the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of a <hi>Governour</hi> to us, and consequently engaging himself to terms of Justice in his dealing with us, and to protect us, and reward us, if we did obey; and making us capable of an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting happiness as our end, and appointing us sufficient means thereto. These <hi>Benefits</hi> denominated God the <hi>Great Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor or Father</hi> unto man, in the state of his <hi>Creation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But then moreover he is a <hi>Common Benefactor</hi> also. 4. By so <hi>loving the world as to give his only begotten Son, to be their Redeemer;</hi> a sufficient <hi>sacrifice</hi> for sin. 5. By giving out his <hi>Promise</hi> or <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> and making a <hi>Common Deed of Gift</hi> of pardon, Reconciliation and Eternal Life, to all that will accept it in and with Christ, to Gospel ends. 6. By send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:59347:79"/>
forth the Messengers of this Grace, commanding them to <hi>Preach to every creature the Gospel,</hi> or <hi>word of Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion committed to them, and to beseech men in Christs stead, as his Embassadours, as if God himself did intreat by them, to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to God,</hi> Matth. 28. 18, 19. Mar. 16. 16. 2 Cor. 5. 19, 20. 7. By affording some <hi>common mercies</hi> without, and motions of his spirit within, to second these invitations. But though by this much <hi>God</hi> hath a <hi>Title</hi> to <hi>their dearest Love,</hi> yet <hi>they</hi> have <hi>no Title</hi> to his <hi>highest Benefits,</hi> nor are in the <hi>nearest Relation</hi> of <hi>Children</hi> or <hi>Beneficiaries</hi> to him.</p>
                     <p>But, 8. When he <hi>begetteth us again to a lively Hope, by his incorruptible seed,</hi> and <hi>giveth</hi> us both <hi>to will and to do,</hi> and when the <hi>Father</hi> effectually <hi>draweth us to the Son,</hi> and <hi>reneweth us according to his Image,</hi> and <hi>taketh away our old and stony hearts, and giveth us new and tender hearts,</hi> and <hi>giveth</hi> us to <hi>Know him,</hi> and Love him as a Father; then is he <hi>our Father</hi> in the dearest and most comfortable sense, and we are his children that have interest in his <hi>dearest Love.</hi> 9. And therefore we have his spirit, and pardon, Justification and Reconciliation with him. 10. And also we have special Communion with him in Prayer, Praises, Sacraments and all holy Ordinances and Conversation. 11. And we and our services are <hi>pleasing</hi> to him, and so we are in the <hi>light of his countenance,</hi> and under a special promise of his protection and provision, and that all things shall work together for our good. 12. And we have the promise of <hi>perfection in everlasting Glory.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>II. And now as you see <hi>how</hi> God is <hi>our Benefactor,</hi> or <hi>most Gracious and Loving Father,</hi> let us next see what this must work on us.</p>
                     <p>And 1. <hi>Goodness</hi> and <hi>Bounty</hi> should shame men from their sin, and lead them to <hi>Repentance,</hi> Rom. 2. 4, 5. <hi>Love</hi> is not to be abused and requited with unkindness and provocation. He that can <hi>turn grace into wantonness,</hi> and <hi>do evil</hi> because grace hath abounded, or that it may abound, shall be forced to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess that his <hi>damnation is just.</hi> He that will not hate his sin, when he seeth such exceeding Benefits stand by, and heareth mercy, and wonderful mercy plead against it, and upbraid the sinner with ingratitude, is like to die a double death, and shall have <hi>no more sacrifice for sin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="127" facs="tcp:59347:79"/>2. The <hi>Fatherly Love</hi> and <hi>Benefits</hi> of God, do call for our best returns of <hi>Love.</hi> The <hi>Benefits</hi> of <hi>Creation,</hi> oblige all to Love him with all their Heart, and Soul, and Might: Much more the <hi>Benefits</hi> of <hi>Redemption,</hi> and especially (as <hi>applyed</hi> by <hi>sanctifying Grace</hi> to them that shall be heirs of life, it obligeth them by multiplied strongest obligations: The <hi>Worst</hi> are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged <hi>to as much Love</hi> of God, as the <hi>Best</hi> (for none can be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to more than to <hi>Love him with all their Heart,</hi> &amp;c.) but they are not <hi>as much obliged to</hi> that Love: We have new and special obligations; and therefore must return a Hearty Love, or we are <hi>doubly guilty. Mercies</hi> are <hi>Loves Messengers,</hi> sent from Heaven to win up our Hearts to <hi>Love again,</hi> and entice us thither. All mercies therefore should be used to this end. That mercy that doth not encrease, or excite and help our <hi>Love,</hi> is abused and lost, as seed that is buried when it's sowed, and never more appeareth. Earthly Mercies point to Heaven, and tell us whence they come, and for what. Like the Flowers of the Spring, they tell us of the reviving approaches of the Sun: But like foolish children, because they are <hi>near us,</hi> we <hi>Love the Flowers</hi> better than the <hi>Sun;</hi> forgetting that the Winter is drawing on. But <hi>Spiritual Mercies</hi> are as the <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shine</hi> that more <hi>immediately</hi> dependeth on, and floweth from the <hi>Sun it self.</hi> And he that will not see (and value) the <hi>Sun</hi> by <hi>its Light,</hi> will <hi>never</hi> see it! These beams come down to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite our Minds and Hearts to God; and if we shut the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, or play till night, and they return without us, we shall be left to <hi>utter darkness.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Mercies</hi> of God must imprint upon our minds the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest and deepest conceptions of him, as the <hi>most perfect, suitable, Lovely Objects</hi> to the soul of man; when <hi>all our Good</hi> is Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally <hi>in him,</hi> and all flows <hi>from him,</hi> that hath the Goodness of a <hi>Means,</hi> and <hi>finally</hi> himself is <hi>all;</hi> not to <hi>Love God</hi> then, is not to <hi>Love Goodness it self;</hi> and there is nothing but <hi>Good</hi> that's suited to <hi>our Love.</hi> Night and day therefore should the Believer be drawing and deriving from God, by the views and tasts of his precious Mercies, a sweetness of nature, and increase of holy Love to God, as the Bee sucks Honey from the flowers. We should not now and then for a recreation light upon a flower, and meditate on some Mercy of the Lord, but
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:59347:80"/>
make this our work from day to day, and keep continually up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our souls, the lively tasts, and deep impressions of the <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Goodness and Amiableness</hi> of God. When we <hi>Love God most,</hi> we are at the <hi>best,</hi> most pleasing to God; and our lives are sweetest to our selves: And when we steep our minds in the believing thoughts of the abundant Fatherly <hi>Mercies of the Lord,</hi> we shall most abundantly <hi>Love him.</hi> Every <hi>Mercy</hi> is a <hi>Suiter</hi> to us from God! The contents of them all is this [<hi>My Son, Give mee thy Heart] [Love him that thus loveth thee</hi>] Love him, or you reject him. O wonderful Love! that God will <hi>regard</hi> the Love of man! that he will enter into a <hi>Covenant of Love!</hi> that he will be <hi>Related</hi> to us in a <hi>Relation</hi> of <hi>Love!</hi> and that he will deal with us on <hi>terms of Love!</hi> that he will give us <hi>leave</hi> to <hi>Love him,</hi> that are so base, and have so Loved Earth and Sin! yea and that he will be so ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest a suiter for our Love, as if he needed it, when it is only we that need! But the paths of Love are mysterious and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible.</p>
                     <p>3. As God is in <hi>special</hi> a <hi>Benefactor and Father to us,</hi> we must be the <hi>readiest,</hi> and most <hi>diligent</hi> in obedience to him. <hi>Childlike</hi> duty is the most <hi>willing</hi> and <hi>unwearied</hi> kind of duty. Where <hi>Love</hi> is the principle, we shall not be <hi>eye-servants,</hi> but <hi>delight to do the Will of God,</hi> and wish, O that I could please him more! It is a singular delight to a Gracious soul to be upon any acceptable duty; and the more he can do good, and please the Lord, the more he is pleased. As <hi>Fatherly Love and Benefits</hi> are the <hi>fullest</hi> and the <hi>surest,</hi> so will <hi>filial duty</hi> be. The Heart is no fit soil for Mercies, if they grow not up to holy fruits. The more you love, the more chearfully will you obey.</p>
                     <p>4. From hence we must well learn, both <hi>How God is mans End,</hi> and what are the <hi>chief Means that lead us to him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>1. <hi>God</hi> is not the <hi>End</hi> of <hi>Reason, nakedly considered,</hi> but he is <hi>Finis Amantis, the End which Love inclineth us to,</hi> and which <hi>by Love is attained,</hi> and <hi>by love enjoyed:</hi> The understanding of which would resolve many great perplexing difficulties that <hi>à natura finis</hi> do step into our way in Theological studies. I will name no more now, but only that it teacheth us, <hi>How both God and our own Felicity in the fruition of him, may be said to be
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:59347:80"/>
our Ultimate End, without any contradiction,</hi> yet so that it be <hi>Eminently</hi> and <hi>Chiefly God.</hi> For it is a <hi>Union</hi> (such as our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are capable of) that is desired, in which the soul doth long to be swallowed up in God; Understand but what a <hi>fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lial</hi> or <hi>friendly Love</hi> is, and you may understand what a regular <hi>Intention</hi> is, and how <hi>God must be the Christians End.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. And withall it shews us, that the most direct and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent <hi>means</hi> of our felicity, and to our End, are those that are most suited to the <hi>work of Love. Others</hi> are <hi>means</hi> more <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motely,</hi> and necessary in their places; but <hi>these directly.</hi> And therefore the <hi>Promises</hi> and Narratives of the <hi>Love and Mercy</hi> of the Lord, are the most direct and powerful part of the <hi>Gospel</hi> conducing to our End: and the <hi>Threatnings</hi> the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moter</hi> means. And therefore as Grace was advanced in the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the <hi>Promissory</hi> part of Gods Covenant or Law, grew more <hi>illustrious,</hi> and the <hi>Gospel</hi> consisted so much of <hi>Promises,</hi> that it is called <hi>Glad tydings of great joy.</hi> And therefore the most full demonstration of Gods <hi>Goodness and Loveliness</hi> to our hearers, is the most <hi>excellent part</hi> of all our Preaching, though it is <hi>not all.</hi> And therefore the meditation of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,</hi> is more powerful than the bare meditation of <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> because it is <hi>Redemption</hi> that most eminently revealeth Love. And therefore <hi>Christ</hi> is the <hi>Principal Means</hi> of Life, because he is the Principal Messenger and Demonstration of the <hi>Fathers Love,</hi> and by the wonders of <hi>Love</hi> which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealeth, and exhibiteth in his wondrous Grace, he wins the soul to the <hi>Love of God.</hi> For God will have <hi>external objective means,</hi> and <hi>internal effective means</hi> concur, because he will work on man agreeably to the nature of man. Though there was never given out such prevalent invincible measures of the Spirit, as Christ hath given for the Renewing of those that he will save, yet shall not that Spirit do it without <hi>as excellent ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective means.</hi> And though <hi>Christ,</hi> and the Riches of his Grace revealed in the Gospel, be the most <hi>wonderful objective means,</hi> yet shall not <hi>these</hi> do it without the <hi>internal effectual means.</hi> But when <hi>Love</hi> doth shine to us so resplendently <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out</hi> us, in the face of the Glorious <hi>Sun</hi> of <hi>Love,</hi> and is also <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="130" facs="tcp:59347:81"/>
Heaven, and leads to Heaven, and will never rest till it have reacht its center, and brought us to the face and arms of God.</p>
                     <p>5. And from the <hi>Fatherly Relation</hi> and <hi>Love of God,</hi> we must learn to <hi>Trust him,</hi> and <hi>Rest our souls</hi> in his <hi>securing Love.</hi> Shall we distrust a <hi>Father?</hi> an <hi>Omnipotent Father!</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is this Relation prefixed to the Petitions of the Lords Prayer, and we begin with [<hi>Our Father which art in Heaven</hi>] that when we remember <hi>his Love,</hi> and our <hi>Interest</hi> in him, and his Alsufficiency, we may be encouraged to <hi>Trust</hi> him, and make our addresses to him. If a <hi>Father,</hi> and <hi>such a Father</hi> smite mee, I will submit, and kiss the Rod: for I know it is the healing fruit of <hi>Love.</hi> If a <hi>Father,</hi> and <hi>such a Father</hi> afflict mee, wound mee, deal strangely wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>h mee, and grieve my flesh, let mee not murmure or distrust him; for he well understandeth what he doth; and nothing that shall hurt mee finally can come from Omnipotent <hi>Paternal Love.</hi> If a <hi>Father,</hi> and <hi>such a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kill mee,</hi> yet let mee <hi>Trust in him,</hi> and let not my soul re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine at his proceedings, nor tremble at the separating stroak of death. A Beast knows not when we strive with him, what we intend, whether to <hi>Cure,</hi> or to <hi>Kill him:</hi> but a <hi>Child</hi> need not fear a <hi>killing blow,</hi> nor a <hi>Loving soul</hi> a <hi>damning death,</hi> from <hi>such a Father.</hi> If he be a Father, where is his Love and Trust?</p>
                     <p>6. If God be our <hi>Father,</hi> and so wonderful a <hi>Benefactor</hi> to us, then <hi>Thanks and Praise</hi> must be our most <hi>constant work,</hi> and must be studied above all the rest of Duty, and most dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently performed. If the tongue of man, which is called his Glory, be made for <hi>any thing,</hi> and good for any thing, it is to give the <hi>Lord his Glory,</hi> in the Thankful acknowledgement of his Love and Mercies, and the daily chearful Praises of his Name. Let this then be the Christians work.</p>
                     <p>7. The <hi>Children</hi> of <hi>such a Father,</hi> should live a <hi>contented chearful life.</hi> Diligence becometh them, but not contrivances for worldly greatness, nor carking cares for that which their Father hath promised them to care for. <hi>Humility</hi> and <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> beseemeth them, but not <hi>dejection</hi> and <hi>despondency</hi> of mind, and a still complaining, fearful, troubled, disconsolate soul. If the Children of such a Father shall not be bold and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:59347:81"/>
and chearful, let joy and confidence then be banished from the earth, and be renounced by all the Sons of men.</p>

                     <p>15. THere are yet divers subordinate Attributes of God, that being comprized in the forementioned, may be passed over with the briefer touch. And the next that I shall speak of, is, his <hi>Freedome.</hi> And God is <hi>Free</hi> in more senses than one; but for brevity, I shall speak of all together.</p>
                     <p>1. And first, God hath a <hi>Natural Freedome of Will,</hi> being Determined to Will by nothing without him, nor liable to any Necessity, but what is consistent with perfect Blessedness and Liberty. His own Being, and Blessedness, and Perfections, are not the objects of his <hi>Election;</hi> and therefore not of that which we call <hi>Free Will:</hi> But all his <hi>works without,</hi> as Creation, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, Redemption, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are the effects of his <hi>Free Will:</hi> Not but that his Will concerning all these, hath a <hi>Necessity of exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence:</hi> For God did <hi>from Eternity Will</hi> the <hi>Creation,</hi> and all that is done in time; and therefore <hi>from Eternity</hi> that will <hi>exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting,</hi> had a <hi>Necessity of existence:</hi> But yet it was <hi>Free,</hi> because it proceedeth not <hi>Necessarily</hi> from the <hi>very Nature of God: God was God</hi> before he made the world, or Redeemed it, or did the things that are daily done. And therefore one part of the Schoolmen maintain, not only that there is <hi>Contingency from God,</hi> but that there could be no <hi>Contingency</hi> in the Creature, if it had not its <hi>Original in God:</hi> the Liberty of God being the fountain of Contingency.</p>
                     <p>2. There is also an Eminency both of <hi>Dominion</hi> and <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty</hi> in God, according to which he may be called <hi>Free.</hi> His <hi>Absoluteness</hi> of <hi>Propriety</hi> freeth him from the restraint of any Obligation, but what floweth from his own <hi>Free Will,</hi> from Disposing of his own as he pleases. And his <hi>Absolute Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> freeth him from the Obligation of his own Laws as Laws, though he will still be true to his Promises and Predictions. Let man therefore take heed how he questioneth his Maker, or censureth his Laws, or Works, or Waies.</p>

As the <hi>Perfection</hi> of his nature is the <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of all Moral Good.</hi> 1. In the <hi>Holiness</hi> of his <hi>Law,</hi> the <hi>Rule</hi> of Holiness. 2. In the <hi>Holiness</hi> of the <hi>soul:</hi> and, 3. In his <hi>holy Judgements.</hi> And consequently as this <hi>Perfect Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> is contrary to all the <hi>Moral Pollution</hi> of the Creature, loathing iniquity, forbiding and condemning it. That <hi>Perfect Goodness</hi> of the <hi>will</hi> of God, from whence floweth holy Laws, and motions, and the Holiness of the soul of man, is it that Scripture meaneth usually by <hi>Gods Holiness;</hi> rather then the foresaid distance from the Creatures. And therefore his <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness</hi> is usually given as the Reason of his <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> and of his <hi>enmity to sin:</hi> And our <hi>Holiness</hi> is called his <hi>Image</hi> (who imitate not his <hi>Transcendency</hi>) and we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be <hi>Holy as he is Holy,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 16. The nature of the <hi>Image</hi> will best tell us what <hi>Holiness</hi> is in God. <hi>Holiness</hi> in us is called <hi>The Divine Nature,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 4. and therefore is radically a <hi>right inclination and disposition</hi> of the soul; which hath its rise from a Transcendent Holiness in God, even as our Wisdome from his Transcendent Wisdome, and our Being from his Being. Holiness therefore being indeed the same
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:59347:83"/>
with the Transcendently Moral Goodness of God, which I have spoken of before, I shall say but little of it now. Thus must the Holiness of God be known.</p>
                     <p>1. It must cause us to have a most high and honourable esteem of <hi>Holiness</hi> in the Creature, because it is the <hi>Image</hi> of the <hi>Holiness of God.</hi> Three sorts of Creatures have a <hi>Deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative Holiness:</hi> The first is <hi>The Law;</hi> which is the meer signification of the Wise and Holy Will of God concerning mans Duty with Rewards and Penalties, for the Holy Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the world! This is the <hi>nearest Image</hi> of God, engraven upon that Seal which must be the Instrument of imprinting it on our souls. Now the <hi>Holiness</hi> of the <hi>Word</hi> is not the meer product of the <hi>Will</hi> of God, considered as a <hi>Will;</hi> but of the Will of God considered as <hi>Holy,</hi> that is, as the Infinite Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendent Moral Goodness in the Architype or Original. For all <hi>events</hi> that proceed from God, are the products of his <hi>Will which is Holy,</hi> but not <hi>as Holy</hi> (as the creating, preserving, disposing of every fly, or fish in the sea, or worm in the earth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) There is somewhat therefore in the Nature of God, which is the <hi>Perfection of his Will,</hi> and is called <hi>Holiness,</hi> which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>he <hi>Holiness of the Law</hi> doth flow from and express.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Holy</hi> Word is the <hi>Immortal seed</hi> that begetteth <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> in the soul, which is the <hi>second subject</hi> of <hi>derived Holiness;</hi> And this <hi>our Holiness</hi> is a <hi>conformity of the soul to the Law,</hi> as the <hi>Product</hi> of the <hi>Holy Will of God,</hi> and not a meer conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to his <hi>predictions,</hi> and <hi>decreeing Will</hi> as such. It is a <hi>separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to God,</hi> but not <hi>every separation: Pharaoh</hi> was set apart to be the <hi>Passive monument</hi> of the Honour of Gods Name: and <hi>Cyrus</hi> was his <hi>servant</hi> to restore his people, and yet not <hi>thus Holy:</hi> But it is a <hi>separation from common and unclean uses;</hi> and a <hi>Purgation</hi> from <hi>polluting vice,</hi> and a <hi>renovation</hi> by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the <hi>Image of Gods Holiness,</hi> whose Nature is to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline the soul to God, and devote it wholly to him; both in <hi>Justice,</hi> because we are <hi>his own,</hi> and in <hi>Love,</hi> because he is <hi>most Holy</hi> and perfectly <hi>Good.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>third subject</hi> of <hi>Holiness</hi> is those creatures that are but <hi>separated</hi> to Holy uses, and these have but a <hi>Relative Holiness,</hi> and <hi>secundum quid:</hi> As the <hi>Temple,</hi> the <hi>holy utensils,</hi> the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> as to the materials, the <hi>Minister,</hi> as an <hi>Officer,</hi> the people as <hi>visible members,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                        <pb n="135" facs="tcp:59347:83"/>All these must be reverenced and honoured by us, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the proportion of their <hi>Holiness.</hi> 1. Our <hi>principal Reverence</hi> must be to the <hi>Holy Word of God:</hi> For <hi>Holiness</hi> is more <hi>perfect</hi> there then in <hi>our souls.</hi> The <hi>Holiness of the Word,</hi> which is it that the ungodly hate or quarrel at, is the Glory of it in the eyes of Holy men. We may much discern a Holy and an unholy soul, by their <hi>Loving</hi> or <hi>not loving</hi> a <hi>Holy Law;</hi> especially as it is <hi>a Rule</hi> to themselves. A distast of the <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of <hi>Scripture,</hi> and of the <hi>Holiness</hi> of the writings of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, and of the <hi>Holiness</hi> of their <hi>preaching</hi> or <hi>conference,</hi> discovereth an <hi>unholy soul.</hi> A Love to <hi>holy Doctrine</hi> sheweth that there is somewhat suitable to it in the soul that Loveth it. It is the elogy of the Scriptures, the Promises, the Covenant, the Prophets and Apostles, that they are <hi>all Holy,</hi> Rom. 1. 2. Psal. 105. 42. Luk. 1. 70, 72. Rev. 18. 20. 2 Tim. 3. 15. Rom. 7. 12. The <hi>Holiness</hi> of the <hi>Scripture</hi> doth make it as suitable and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury to a <hi>Holy soul,</hi> as <hi>Light</hi> is suitable to the <hi>eye-sight,</hi> and <hi>sweetness</hi> to the <hi>tast:</hi> and therefore it is to them as the hony comb. But to the <hi>unholy</hi> it is a mystery, and as <hi>foolishness,</hi> and that which is contrary to their disposition, and they have an <hi>enmity</hi> to it: which makes a wonderful difference in their judging of the <hi>evidences</hi> of <hi>Scripture Verity,</hi> and much facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tateth the work of Faith in one sort, and strengtheneth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief in the other. Holy doctrine is the Glass that sheweth us the Holy face of God himself, and therefore must needs be most excellent to the Saints.</p>
                     <p>2. And we must honour and love also the <hi>Holiness of the Saints:</hi> For they also bear the <hi>Image of the Lord.</hi> Their <hi>Holy Affections, Prayers, Discourses,</hi> and <hi>Conversations</hi> must be beautiful in our eyes: And we must take heed of those tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that either from <hi>personal injuries</hi> received from any, or from their <hi>blots</hi> or <hi>imperfections,</hi> or from their <hi>meanness</hi> in the world, or from the contempt and reproach and slanders of the ungodly, would draw us to think dishononrably of their <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi> He that honoureth the Holy God, will honour his <hi>Image</hi> in his <hi>Holy people. In his eyes a vile person will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned, but he will honour them that fear the Lord,</hi> Psal. 15. 4. <hi>The Saints on earth are the excellent</hi> in his eyes, and his <hi>delight</hi> is in them, <hi>Psal.</hi> 16. 2, 3. The breathings of Divine Love in
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:59347:84"/>
the holy Prayers, Praises and Speeches of the Saints, and their Reverent and Holy mention of his Name, are things that a holy soul doth sweetly relish, and take pleasure in, as we would do to hear an <hi>Angel</hi> speak of the Holy things of the invisible Glory.</p>

                     <p>18. THe next Attribute of God to be spoken of, is [<hi>His Veracity, Truth, and Faithfulness.</hi>] This is the result of his perfect <hi>Wisdome, Goodness,</hi> and <hi>Omnipotency:</hi> For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is <hi>most Wise</hi> and <hi>Powerful,</hi> he cannot be <hi>Necessitated</hi> to <hi>Lye:</hi> And because he is <hi>most Good, he will not Lye.</hi> Though God speaketh by none but a <hi>Created Voice,</hi> and signifie his Will to us by men, that in themselves considered are defectible, yet what he maketh <hi>his Voice</hi> shall speak <hi>Truth;</hi> and what he chooseth to signifie <hi>his Will,</hi> shall <hi>truly signifie</hi> it. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore condemneth <hi>Lying</hi> in man, because it is contrary to his <hi>own Veracity.</hi> For if any should say that God is under no Law, and therefore is not bound to speak Ttuth, or not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a Prophet or Apostle by his Inspirations; I answer, that he hateth Lying as contrary to his <hi>Perfect Nature,</hi> and is <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self</hi> against it, and cannot possibly be guilty of it, because of his <hi>own Perfection;</hi> and not because he is <hi>under a Law.</hi> Lying comes from <hi>some Imperfection,</hi> either of <hi>Knowledge, Power,</hi> or <hi>Goodness,</hi> which can none of them befall the Lord. The <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of the <hi>Creature</hi> is a <hi>Goodness</hi> of <hi>Conformity</hi> to an <hi>Obliging Law;</hi> and the Goodness of the <hi>Law</hi> is a Goodness of <hi>Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi> to, and expression of the <hi>Good Will of God.</hi> But the <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God</hi> is a <hi>Perfection of Essence,</hi> the <hi>Primitive Goodness,</hi> which is the <hi>Fountain,</hi> and <hi>Standard,</hi> and <hi>End</hi> of all other Good; and not a Goodness of Conformity to another.</p>
                     <p>And this Attribute of God is of very great use to his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. 1. From hence we must be Resolved for Duty, and for a holy, heavenly life: because the Commands of God are serious, and his Promises and Threatnings <hi>True.</hi> If God were not <hi>True,</hi> that tells us of these great Eternal things, then might we excuse our selves from <hi>Godliness,</hi> and justifie the worldling in his sensual way: There is nothing of common sense and reason that can be said against a Holy life, by a man
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:59347:85"/>
that denieth not the <hi>Truth of God,</hi> or of his <hi>Word.</hi> And to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Gods Truth</hi> is most unreasonable of all: O Sirs! when you read and hear of the wonderful weighty matters of the Scripture, of an <hi>Endless Life,</hi> and the way thereto; bethink you, if these things <hi>be True,</hi> what <hi>manner of persons you should be in all Holy Conversation and Godliness!</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 11. If the <hi>Word be True,</hi> that telleth us of <hi>Death and Judgement,</hi> and <hi>Heaven and Hell,</hi> is it time for us to <hi>sin,</hi> to <hi>trifle</hi> and live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready!</p>
                     <p>2. The <hi>Truth of God</hi> is the <hi>Terror</hi> of <hi>his Enemies.</hi> O hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pymen, if their Unbelief could make void the Threatnings of God, and doubting of them would make them false! and if their misery were as easily remedied as denied; and <hi>ended</hi> as easily as now <hi>forgotten!</hi> or <hi>forgotten</hi> hereafter as easily as now! But true and righteous is the Lord, and <hi>from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his Word is true,</hi> Psal. 119. 16. Not a word shall fall to the ground, nor a jot or tittle pass unfufilled.</p>
                     <p>3. The <hi>Truth of God</hi> is the <hi>Ground of Faith,</hi> and the stay of our souls, and the Rock of all our confidence and comfort. A Christian did not differ from another man (unless in being somewhat more deluded) if God were not <hi>True.</hi> But this is the foundation of all our hopes, and the life of our Religion, and all that we are as Christians, proceeds from this. <hi>Faith</hi> is <hi>animated</hi> by <hi>Gods Veracity,</hi> and from thence all <hi>other Graces flow,</hi> or are excited in us. O Christians, what a treasure is before your eyes, when you open the Blessed Book of God! what life should it put into your confidence and comforts, to think that all these words <hi>are true!</hi> All those descriptions of the Everlasting Kingdome, and all those exceeding precious Promises of this life, and that which is to come, and all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of that exceeding Love of God unto his servants, all these are the <hi>True sayings of God. A faithful witness will not Lye,</hi> Prov. 14. 5. much less will the faithful God. <hi>Eternal Life is promised by God that cannot Lye,</hi> Tit. 1. 2. [<hi>Wherein God willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of Promise, the immutability of his Counsels confirmed it by an oath; that by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to Lye, we might have a strong Consolation, who have fled for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us</hi>] Heb. 6. 17, 18. Let

Faith therefore live upon the Truth of God, and let us be strengthned, and rejoyce therein.</p>
                     <p>4. Abhor all doctrines which deny the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness</hi> of God: For they destroy the ground of <hi>Christian Faith,</hi> of <hi>all Divine Faith,</hi> and <hi>all Religion.</hi> The <hi>Veracity</hi> of God is the <hi>formal Object</hi> of all <hi>Divine Faith:</hi> We <hi>believe</hi> God, because he <hi>cannot Lye:</hi> If <hi>he can Lye,</hi> and <hi>do Lye,</hi> he is not <hi>credible.</hi> But you will say, Is there any that hold such odious doctrines? <hi>Answ.</hi> I like not the charging of <hi>Persons</hi> with the consequences of their opinions which they discern not, but disclaim: God will not charge them with such consequences, who do their best to know the truth, and why should we? All men have <hi>some errours,</hi> whose <hi>consequences</hi> contradict some Articles of Faith. It is not the <hi>persons</hi> that I perswade you to dislike, but the <hi>Doctrine.</hi> And the <hi>Doctrine</hi> is never the less to be abhorred, because a <hi>wise</hi> or <hi>good</hi> man may hold that which doth infer it.</p>
                     <p>I shall now instance only in the Dominicans <hi>predetermina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> They that hold that it is <hi>necessary to the being of every circumstantiated act natural and free, that God be the principal immediate Physical efficient predetermining cause of it,</hi> do hold that he <hi>so causeth</hi> all the <hi>false speeches</hi> and <hi>writings</hi> (as well as other sins) that ever were spoken or written in the world: not only as they are <hi>acts in genere,</hi> but as these <hi>words</hi> in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular; as that he so <hi>predetermined</hi> the tongues of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> to say those very words which they said, rather than others: Now seeing it is apparent 1. That <hi>God</hi> hath <hi>not a voice</hi> but speaketh to us by <hi>a Created Voice,</hi> even by <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apostles,</hi> and that the Scripture was written <hi>by men.</hi> 2. And that <hi>Gods Veracity,</hi> which is the <hi>formal object</hi> of our Faith, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth in his <hi>not using lying instruments,</hi> nor sending a lying messenger to us; (it is <hi>Veracitas revelantis per alium.</hi>) 3. And that no way of <hi>Inspiration</hi> can make God to be any more the cause of the words or writings of an Apostle, than his <hi>Immediate Physical efficient</hi> specifying <hi>predetermination</hi> doth (for it can do no more than irresistibly as the first cause, Physically to premove the agent to this <hi>Thought, Will, Word,</hi> or <hi>Deed,</hi> considered with all its circumstances,) It followeth that we have no certainty when God premoveth an Apostle or Prophet to speak true,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:59347:86"/>
and when to speak falsly; and that no words or writings are o certain truth, upon any account of Gods inspiration or premo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, because God not only <hi>can,</hi> but <hi>doth</hi> cause all the untruths that are spoken or written in the world: Therefore no Faith in Gods Revelations hath any sure foundation, nor any formal object at all: And so all Religion is dasht out at a stroke. To say that God causeth not the <hi>falsity</hi> of the word, nor the <hi>word as false,</hi> but the <hi>word which is false,</hi> might well be the justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of them that affirm God to be but the <hi>Universal Cause</hi> of the <hi>Word</hi> o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <hi>Act in genere</hi> as <hi>a Word or Act;</hi> and that the specification is only from the sinner. But in them that say he is the <hi>particular Cause</hi> of <hi>this word</hi> comparatively rather than another, it is but a contradiction: 1. For there is no other cause of the <hi>falsity,</hi> which is a <hi>meer Relation,</hi> but that which causeth the <hi>Rule</hi> and the <hi>Word</hi> or <hi>Writing which is false,</hi> and so layeth the foundation. 2. It overthroweth all certainty of Faith, if God speak to us by his Instruments, <hi>those words that are false:</hi> The <hi>Quod falsum,</hi> as well as the <hi>Qua falsum,</hi> leaveth us no ground of certainty. The Dominicans therefore have but one task in which their hope is placed, to excuse their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion from plain obliterating all Divine Belief and Religion, and that is, to prove that there is so great a difference between <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration,</hi> and their <hi>Physical Predetermination,</hi> that God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not by <hi>Inspiration</hi> premove to an untruth, though by <hi>Physical Predetermination</hi> he may: This is their task; which I see not the least possibility that ever they should perform: If God <hi>premove,</hi> and <hi>predeterminate</hi> every <hi>Will,</hi> and <hi>Tongue,</hi> and <hi>Pen,</hi> to every lye that is spoken or written, more potently and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistibly than I move my Pen in writing, it is past my power to understand what more he can do by inspiration, to interest him in the Creatures Act: or at least how the difference can be so great as that <hi>one</hi> of the waies he can <hi>predetermine all men</hi> to their falsities, and <hi>none</hi> the other way. But of this I have written a large Disputation; yet think it not needless, even in a <hi>practical Treatise</hi> to say this much here.</p>
                     <p>5. The <hi>Truth of God</hi> must teach us to hate every <hi>Motion</hi> to <hi>Unbelief</hi> in our selves and others: It is a hainons sin to give God the <hi>Lye,</hi> though he speak to us but by his messengers: Every <hi>honest man,</hi> so far as he is <hi>honest,</hi> is to be believed: and
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:59347:87"/>
is God less true? A graceless Gallant will challenge you the field for the dishonour, if you give him the <hi>Lye.</hi> If you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Gods <hi>Veracity,</hi> you do not only equal him with the <hi>worst of men,</hi> but with the <hi>Devil,</hi> who was a <hi>Lyer</hi> from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Yea you make him uncapable of being the <hi>Governour of the world,</hi> or suppose him to <hi>Govern</hi> it by <hi>Deceits and Lyes.</hi> Abhor therefore the first motions of <hi>Unbelief.</hi> It makes men somewhat <hi>worse than Devils;</hi> for the <hi>Devils</hi> know that God <hi>cannot lye,</hi> and therefore they <hi>believe and tremble. Unbelief</hi> of the Truth of the Word of God, is the curse of the soul; the enemy and bane of all Grace and Religion, so far as it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaileth: Let it be the principal care and labour of your souls, to settle the foundation of your Faith aright, and to discern the <hi>Evidence</hi> of <hi>Divine Authority</hi> in the holy Scriptures, and to extirpate the remnants of Infidelity in your hearts.</p>
                     <p>6. Let the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Faithfulness</hi> of God engage you to be <hi>True</hi> and <hi>Faithful</hi> to <hi>him,</hi> and to <hi>each other.</hi> You have promised him to be his servants; be <hi>faithful</hi> in your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises: You are in Covenant with him: break not your Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. Many a particular promise of Reformation you have made to God: Prove not <hi>false</hi> to him that is <hi>True</hi> to you.</p>
                     <p>Be as good as your <hi>word</hi> to all men that you have to do with. Abhor a <hi>Lye</hi> as the off-spring of the Devil, who is the <hi>father</hi> of it: Remember you serve a <hi>God of Truth:</hi> and that it is the Rectitude and Glory of his servants to be confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to him. They say the Turks are offended at Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, because of the <hi>lyes</hi> and <hi>falshood</hi> of <hi>Christians.</hi> But sure they were but nominal Christians, and no true Christians that ever they found such: And its pitty that <hi>Christianity</hi> should be judged of through the world, by the lives of them that <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver were Christians</hi> but from the teeth outward, and the skin that was washt in Baptism. They that will <hi>lye to God,</hi> and covenant to be his holy Servants, when they hate his holy service, will <hi>lye to man,</hi> when their commodity requireth it. When they seem to Repent, and honour him with their tongues [<hi>They flatter him with their mouth, and lye to him with their tongues; for their heart is not right with him, neither are they stedfast in his Covenant</hi>] Psal. 78. 34, 35, 36; 37. God saith, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19. 11. <hi>Ye shall not steal, nor deal fasly, nor lye

one to another.] A Righteous man hateth lying,</hi> Prov. 13. 5. <hi>The lying tongue is but for a moment,</hi> Prov. 12. 19. For <hi>God hateth it,</hi> and it is <hi>an abomination</hi> to him, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16. 16, 17. <hi>The lovers and makers of lyes are shut out of the Kingdom of Christ,</hi> Rev. 22. 15.</p>
                     <p>But above all <hi>false Teachers</hi> that preach and prophesie lyes, and deceive the Rulers and people of the Earth, are abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to God. See <hi>Jer.</hi> 27. 10, 14, 15, 16. &amp; 14. 14. &amp; 23. 25, 26, 32. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13. 9, 12. <hi>Isa.</hi> 54. 13. When <hi>Ahab</hi> was to be destroyed, a <hi>lying spirit in the mouth of his Prophets</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him. And <hi>if a Ruler hearken to lyes, all his servants are wicked,</hi> Prov. 29. 2.</p>
                     <p>7. Above all <hi>false witness</hi> and <hi>perjury</hi> should be most odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the servants of the <hi>God of Truth,</hi> Prov. 19. 9. <hi>A false witness shall not be unpunished, and he that speaketh lyes shall perish</hi>] Eccles. 5. 4, 5. <hi>When thou vowest a vow to God, defer not to pay it.</hi> Saith <hi>David [Thy Vows are upon mee, O God,</hi> Psal. 56. 12. And <hi>unto thee shall the Vow be performed,</hi> Psal. 65. 1. <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury</hi> is a sin that seldome scapeth vengeance, even in this life. The instances of <hi>Saul</hi> the first, and <hi>Zedekiah</hi> the last of the Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> before their desolation, are both very ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible. <hi>Sauls</hi> posterity must be hanged, to stay the Famine that came upon the people for his breaking a Vow that was made by <hi>Joshua,</hi> and not by him, though he did it <hi>in zeal for Israel,</hi> 2 Sam. 21. <hi>Zedekiah</hi>'s case you may see, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 17. He that sweareth, appealeth to God as the searcher of hearts, and avenger of perjury. The perjured person chooseth the vengeance of God. He is unfit (till he repent) to be a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of any civil society. For he dissolveth the bond of all socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. He cannot well be supposed to make conscience of any sin or villany in the world, against God, his Country, his King, his Friend or Neighbour, that makes no conscience of an oath. It is not easie to name a greater wickedness out of Hell, than to <hi>approve of perjury by Laws or Doctrine.</hi> And whether the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> do so or not, I only desire them to consider that have read the third Canon of the Council at <hi>Lateran</hi> under P. <hi>Innocent</hi> the third, where an Approved General Council de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creeth, that the <hi>Pope discharge vassals from their allegiance or fidelity to those Temporal Lords that exterminate not Hereticks</hi>
                        <pb n="144" facs="tcp:59347:88"/>
(as they call them) <hi>out of their dominions.</hi> What shall restrain men from killing Kings, or any villany, if once the <hi>bond of oatht</hi> be nullified? But Scripture saith [<hi>Keep the Kings Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that in regard of the Oath of God,</hi> Eccles. 8 2.] No man defendeth <hi>Perjury by name:</hi> But to say that men that swear to do that which God commandeth, or forbids not, are not bound to keep that oath; or that the Pope may absolve men, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oblige them that swore fidelity to Temporal Lords, when once the Pope hath excommunicated them, doth seem to mee of the same importance.</p>

                     <p>19. THE next <hi>Attribute</hi> to be spoke of, is, his <hi>Mercifulness,</hi> and his <hi>Long-suffering Patience,</hi> which we may set to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. This is implied in his <hi>Goodness,</hi> and the Relation of a <hi>Father</hi> before expressed. <hi>Mercy is Gods Goodness inclining him to prevent or remove his creatures Misery.</hi> It is not <hi>only the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable</hi> that are the <hi>object</hi> of it, but also those that <hi>may be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable;</hi> it being as truly <hi>Mercy</hi> to <hi>keep us</hi> out of it foreseen, as to <hi>deliver us</hi> out of it when we are in it. Hence it is that he <hi>taketh not Pleasure in the death of the wicked, but rather that he turn and Live.</hi> And hence it is that he <hi>Afflicts not willingly, nor grieves the children of men,</hi> Lam. 3. 33. Not that his <hi>Mercy</hi> enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth him to do <hi>all that he can do</hi> for the salvation of every sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, or absolutely to prevent or heal his misery; But it is his Attribute <hi>chiefly</hi> considered as <hi>Governour of the Rational Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> and so his <hi>Mercy</hi> is so great to all, that he will destroy none but for their <hi>wilful sin,</hi> and shut none among us out of Heaven, but those that were guilty of <hi>contemning it.</hi> God doth not <hi>prevent</hi> the sinner with his <hi>Judgement,</hi> but with his <hi>Grace</hi> he often doth. He never punisheth before we are sinners, nor never <hi>Decreed</hi> so to do, as all will grant. He punisheth none, where his foregoing commands and warnings have had their due effect for the prevention: And therefore because the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept</hi> is the first part of his <hi>Law,</hi> and the <hi>Threatning</hi> is but <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servient</hi> to that, and the <hi>first intent</hi> of a <hi>Governour</hi> is to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure

                        <hi>Obedience,</hi> and <hi>Punishing</hi> is but upon supposition that he misseth of the <hi>first;</hi> therefore is God said <hi>not to afflict willingly;</hi> because he doth it not <hi>ex voluntate antecedente,</hi> but <hi>ex voluntate consequente,</hi> that is (for so the distinction is sound) not as a <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver,</hi> and Ruler by those Laws considered <hi>before the violation;</hi> but only as a <hi>Judge of the Law-breakers.</hi> But yet Gods <hi>Mercy</hi> is no security to the <hi>abusers of his Mercy.</hi> Bot rather will sink them into deeper misery, as the aggravation of their sin: As God <hi>Afflicts not willingly,</hi> and yet we <hi>feel</hi> that <hi>he afflicteth:</hi> so if he do <hi>not condemn you willingly,</hi> you shall finde i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> you are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent, that <hi>yet he will condemn you.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If you say, <hi>God can be forced to do nothing against his will:</hi> I answer you, that it is not <hi>simply against his will;</hi> for then it should never come to pass: But it is against the <hi>Principal act of his will,</hi> which floweth from him as a <hi>Law-giver,</hi> or Ruler by Laws, in which respect it may be said that he had <hi>rather that the wicked turn and live:</hi> but yet if they <hi>will not turn,</hi> they <hi>shall not live.</hi> A <hi>merciful Judge</hi> had <hi>rather</hi> the Thief had saved his life by forbearing to steal; but yet he had not rather that <hi>Thieves go unpunished</hi> than he should <hi>condemn</hi> them.</p>
                     <p>But, you'l say, <hi>If God had rather men did not sin, why doth he not hinder it?</hi> I answer 1. He had not <hi>absolutely</hi> and <hi>simply rather;</hi> that is, so far as to do <hi>all that he can</hi> to prevent it, nor all that without which he foreknoweth it will not be preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: But he doth <hi>much against sin</hi> as a <hi>Law-giver,</hi> and <hi>nothing for it;</hi> he causeth us not, but perswades us from it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>as a Ruler</hi> he may be said to have rather that men did not sin, or rather that they would turn and live.</p>
                     <p>1. The Mercy of God, therefore should lead sinners to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and shame them from their sin, and lead them up to God in Love.</p>

Mercy should <hi>encourage</hi> sinners to <hi>Repent,</hi> as well as <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage</hi> them to it: For we have to do with a Merciful God, that hath not shut up any among us in despair, nor forbid them to come in, but continueth to invite when we have oft refused, and will undoubtedly pardon and welcome all that do return.</p>
                     <p>3. Mercy being specially the portion of the Saints, must keep them in <hi>Thankfulness, Love and Comfort:</hi> and all Mercies must be improved for their proper ends: When a Merciful God is

Had we <hi>Davids</hi> heart, what songs of Praise would <hi>Mercy</hi> teach us to indite?

                     <p>But withall, see that you <hi>contemn</hi> not, or <hi>abuse</hi> not Mercy: Use it well; for it is <hi>Mercy</hi> that you must trust to in the hour of your distresses.

Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy,</hi> Matth. 5. 7.

The last judgement will pass much according to mens <hi>works of mercy,</hi> to the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Christ, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. <hi>He shall have judgement without mercy, that hath shewed no mercy: and mercy rejoyceth against judgement,</hi> James 2. 13. <hi>Pure Religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, to visit the Fatherless and Widdows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted in the world,</hi> James 1. 27. <hi>He that</hi> having this worlds goods, <hi>seeth his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in need, and shutteth up the bowels of his compassion from him, how dwelleth the Love of God in him?</hi> But above all <hi>cruelty,</hi> there is none more <hi>devilish</hi> than <hi>cruelty to souls.</hi> And in those that undertake the <hi>place of Pastors,</hi> cruelty to mens souls is a far <hi>greater sin</hi> than in any others.

He is a <hi>Great</hi> and <hi>Dreadful God,</hi> Dan. 9 4. <hi>A mighty God and terrible,</hi> Deut. 7. 21. <hi>A great and terrible God,</hi> Nah. 1. 5. <hi>With God is terrible Majesty,</hi> Job 37. 22. <hi>The Lord most high is terrible,</hi> Psal. 47. 22.</p>
                     <p>1. His Children therefore must be kept in a <hi>holy awe;</hi> God is never to be approached or mentioned, but with the greatest <hi>reverence.</hi> We must <hi>sanctifie the Lord of Hosts himself, and he must be our fear and dread,</hi> Isa. 8. 13. Even they that <hi>receive the unmoveable Kingdom, must have grace in their hearts to serve him acceptably with Reverence and godly fear, because our God is a consuming fire,</hi> Heb. 12. 28, 29. When we come to worship in the holy Assemblies, we should think, as <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 28. 17. <hi>How dreadful is this place? This is none other but the House of God, and this is the gate of Heaven.</hi> Especially when God seemeth to <hi>frown</hi> upon the soul, his servants must <hi>humble</hi> themselves before him, and deprecate his wrath, as <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiah</hi> did, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17. 17. <hi>Be not a terrour to mee.</hi> It ill becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the <hi>best</hi> of men, to make light of the frowns and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of God. Also when he dealeth with us in <hi>Judgement,</hi> and we <hi>feel</hi> the smart of his chastisements, though we must remember that he is <hi>a Father,</hi> yet withall we must consider that he sheweth himself an <hi>offended Father:</hi> And therefore true and deep Humiliation hath ever been the course of afflicted Saints, to turn away the wrath of a <hi>terrible God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="146" facs="tcp:59347:92"/>2. But above all, what cause have the <hi>Ungodly</hi> to <hi>tremble</hi> at the <hi>Dreadfulness</hi> of that God, who is engaged in Justice, (except they be converted) to use them everlastingly as his unpardoned enemies. As there is no <hi>felicity</hi> like the favour of God; and no <hi>joy</hi> comparable to his childrens <hi>joyes;</hi> so is there no <hi>misery</hi> like the sense of his <hi>Displeasure,</hi> nor any <hi>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours</hi> to be compared to those, which his wrath inflicteth everlastingly on the ungodly. O wretched sinner! what hast thou done to make God thine enemy? what could hire thee to offend him by thy willful sin? and to do that which thou knewest he forbad and condemned in his Word? What madness caused thee to make a mock at sin and hell, and to play with the vengeance of the Almighty? what gain did hire thee to cast thy soul into the danger of damnation? canst thou save by the match, if thou win the world and lose thy soul? Didst thou not know who it was thou hadst to do with? It had been better for thee that all the world had been offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with thee, even men and Angels, great and small, than the most <hi>Dreadful</hi> God? Didst thou not <hi>believe</hi> him when he told thee how he was resolved to judge and punish the ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly! Read it 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 7, 8, 9, 10. and 2. 10, 11. <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. <hi>Jud.</hi> 15. <hi>Psal.</hi> 1. &amp;c. what caused thee to venture upon the consuming fire? Didst thou not know that as he is <hi>Merciful,</hi> so he is <hi>Jealous, Holy, Just</hi> and <hi>Terrible?</hi> In the Name of God, I require and intreat thee, fly to his Mercy in Jesus Christ; and hearken speedily to his Grace, and turn at his reproof and warning; To day while it is called to day, harden not thy heart, but hear his voice, lest he resolve in his wrath, that thou shalt never enter into his rest; There is no <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during,</hi> there is no <hi>overcoming,</hi> there is no <hi>contending with</hi> an <hi>angry, dreadful, holy</hi> God: Repent therefore and turn to him, and <hi>obey</hi> the voice of <hi>Mercy</hi> that thy soul may live.</p>
                     <p>3. The <hi>Dreadfulness</hi> of God, doth tell both <hi>good</hi> and <hi>bad</hi> the great necessity of a <hi>Mediator.</hi> What an unspeakable mercy is it that God hath given us his Son! and that by Jesus Christ we may come with <hi>boldness</hi> and <hi>confidence</hi> into the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the <hi>Dreadful</hi> God, that else would have been to us a greater terror than all the world, yea than Satan himself. The more we are apprehensive of our <hi>distance</hi> from God, and
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:59347:93"/>
of his <hi>Terrible Majesty,</hi> and his more <hi>Terrible justice</hi> against such sinners as we have been, the more we shall understand the mysterie of Redemption, and highly value the Mediation of Christ.</p>
                     <p>4. Lastly, let the <hi>Dreadfulness</hi> of God, prevail with every believing soul, to pitty the <hi>ungodly</hi> that pitty not themselves. O pray for them, O warn them, exhort them, intreat them, as men that know the <hi>Terrours</hi> of the Lord, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 11. If <hi>they knew</hi> as well as <hi>you do</hi> what sin is, and what it is to be chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of wrath, and what it is to be unpardoned, unjustified and unsanctified, they would pitty themselves, and cry for mercy, mercy, mercy, from day to day, till they were reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered into a state of life, and turned from the power of Satan unto God. Alas, they know not what it is to die, and to see the world to come, and to appear before a dreadful God: They know not what it is to be in Hell fire; nor what it is to be glorified in Heaven: They never <hi>saw</hi> or <hi>tryed</hi> these things, and they want the <hi>Faith</hi> by which they must be <hi>foreseen</hi> by those that are yet short of nearer knowledge: you therefore that <hi>have Faith</hi> to foreknow these things, and are enlightned by the Spirit of God, O pitty and warn and help the miser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able! Tell them how much easier it is to <hi>escape Hell,</hi> than to <hi>endure</hi> it: and how much easier a <hi>Holy life</hi> on earth is, than the endless wrath of the most <hi>Dreadful</hi> God. Tell them that unbelief, presumption and security, are the certain means to <hi>bring their misery,</hi> but will do nothing to <hi>keep it off;</hi> though they may keep off the present <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>sense</hi> of it, which would have droven them to seek a cure. Tell them that death and judgement are at hand, and that when they laugh, or sport, or scorn, and jeast at the Displeasure of the <hi>Dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful God,</hi> it is posting toward them, and will be upon them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are aware; and when they slumber, their damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion slumbereth not: but while unbelieving sinners say, Peace, Peace, sudden destruction will come upon them, as unexpected travail on a woman with child, and they shall not escape. O tell them how dreadful a thing it is, for a soul that is unregenerate and unsanctified, to go from that body which it pampered and sold its salvation to pleasure, and to appear at the tribunal of God; and how dreadful it is for such a soul,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:59347:93"/>
to fall into the hands of the living God. At least save your own souls, by the faithful discharge of so great a duty; and if they will take no warning, let them at last remember when it is too late, that they were told in time, what they should see and feel at last, and what the later end would prove; and that God and man did warn them in compassion, though they perish because they would have no compassion or mercy upon themselves. Thus let the <hi>Terribleness</hi> of God provoke you, to do <hi>your duty</hi> with <hi>speed</hi> and <hi>zeal,</hi> for the converting and saving of miserable souls.</p>

                     <p>
                        <pb n="161" facs="tcp:59347:98"/>1. To <hi>walk with God</hi> includeth the <hi>Practical</hi> acknowledge ment (that is made by the <hi>Will</hi> as well as the <hi>Understanding</hi>) of the <hi>grand Attributes</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and his <hi>Relations</hi> to <hi>Man;</hi> that he is Infinite in his Being, that is, <hi>Immense</hi> and <hi>Eternal;</hi> as also in his <hi>Power, Wisdome</hi> and <hi>Goodness:</hi> that he is the <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, Redeemer</hi> and <hi>Sanctifier:</hi> that he is our <hi>Absolute Lord</hi> (or <hi>Owner</hi>) our most <hi>Righteous Governour,</hi> and most <hi>bountiful Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor</hi> (or <hi>Father:</hi>) that <hi>Of Him,</hi> and <hi>Through Him,</hi> and <hi>To Him</hi> are all things: that <hi>in him</hi> we <hi>Live,</hi> and <hi>move,</hi> and <hi>have our being:</hi> that he is the fountain, or <hi>first cause</hi> from which all (proper) <hi>Being, Truth</hi> and <hi>Goodness</hi> in the Creature is but a derived stream. To have the soul unfeignedly <hi>resign it self</hi> to Him, as his <hi>Own;</hi> and <hi>subject it self</hi> to <hi>Him</hi> as our <hi>Governour,</hi> walking in the awe of his soveraign Power; sensible of the strong obligation of his Laws, which Reason, Justice and Necessity do all command us to obey. To live as in full <hi>dependence</hi> on him; To have the first and greatest respect unto him: A more <hi>observant</hi> respect to Him than to our Rulers: A more <hi>obedient</hi> respect to Him than to our <hi>Masters:</hi> A more <hi>dependent</hi> tender and honourable respect to Him than to Parents, or our nearest friends. Thus <hi>he that cometh to God</hi> (as God, and so as to be <hi>accepted</hi> of him) <hi>must believe that He is,</hi> (his Essential Attributes) and (what he is in his Relations to man; especially that as our <hi>Governour</hi> and <hi>Benefactor) he is the Rewarder of them that diligent seek him,</hi> Heb. 11. 6. The <hi>impress</hi> of a <hi>Deity</hi> in his Essential and Relative Attributes must be upon the <hi>Heart</hi> of him that <hi>walks with God:</hi> Yea, the <hi>Being</hi> of <hi>God</hi> must be much more remarkable to him, than the <hi>Being</hi> of <hi>all Creatures;</hi> and his <hi>presence</hi> more regarded, than the <hi>presence</hi> of the <hi>Creature;</hi> and all things must be to us in comparison of God, as a <hi>Candle</hi> is in comparison of the <hi>Sun: His Greatness</hi> and transcendent <hi>Excellencies</hi> must so over-power them all, as to make them less observed and regarded, by his taking up our chief observation and regard.</p>
                     <p>2. Our <hi>walking with God</hi> includeth our <hi>Reconciliation to him,</hi> and that we are not in our natural state of <hi>Enmity,</hi> but made <hi>his Children</hi> and <hi>friends</hi> in Christ. <hi>Can two walk to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unless they be agreed?</hi> Amos 3. 3. <hi>Enmity</hi> is against <hi>Unity; Disaffection</hi> causeth <hi>Aversion,</hi> and flying from

each other: Yea the <hi>fears</hi> of a <hi>guilty Child</hi> may make him flye from his Fathers presence, till there be a <hi>particular Reconciliation</hi> besides the <hi>general state</hi> of Reconciliation. A provoking faulty Child doth <hi>Dwell</hi> with God his Father, though under the continual terror of his frowns: But to <hi>walk with him</hi> (in the full sense) is more than to be <hi>rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> to him, and to <hi>dwell with him:</hi> In a <hi>large</hi> sense indeed all Gods Children may be said to <hi>walk with him,</hi> as it signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth only a conversation ordered in godliness, sincerity and simplicity. But in this sublimer sense, as it signifieth <hi>a lively exercise of Faith and Love, and heavenly-mindedness,</hi> and a course of <hi>complacential contemplation,</hi> and holy converse with God, so it is proper only <hi>to some</hi> of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ounder and more vigilant industrious believers. And hereto it is necessary, not only that we be <hi>Justified</hi> and <hi>Reconciled</hi> to God from our <hi>state of Enmity,</hi> but also that we be <hi>pardoned justified</hi> and <hi>reconciled</hi> from our <hi>particular wounding falls,</hi> which are more than the <hi>ordinary infirmities</hi> of Believers. And also it is necessary that we have <hi>grateful friendly thoughts</hi> of God: that we have so much sense of his excellency, goodness and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness <hi>to our selves,</hi> as may give us a <hi>complacency</hi> in conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing with him, and may make the thoughts and mention of him to be desirable and pleasing to us. <hi>Walking with God</hi> doth import, though not the <hi>full assurance</hi> of his special Love and Grace to us, yet <hi>such an apprehension</hi> of his <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Goodness,</hi> as may <hi>draw the heart</hi> to think of him with <hi>desire,</hi> if not with <hi>delight.</hi> A <hi>lothness</hi> to draw near him, to think of him, or to mention him, a <hi>weariness</hi> of his special service, are contrary to this special <hi>walking with God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. Our <hi>Walking with God,</hi> doth include our <hi>esteeming</hi> and <hi>intending Him as the Ultimate End and felicity of our souls.</hi> He is not to be sought, or loved, or conversed with, as a <hi>means</hi> to any <hi>greater good</hi> (for there is no greater) nor as <hi>inferiour,</hi> or meerly <hi>equal</hi> unto any: His <hi>Goodness</hi> must be the most powerful attractive of our <hi>Love:</hi> His <hi>favour</hi> must be valued as our <hi>happiness;</hi> and the <hi>Pleasing of him</hi> must be our most industrious imployment. To <hi>walk with him,</hi> is to live in the <hi>warming reviving</hi> sunshine of his <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
                        <pb n="163" facs="tcp:59347:99"/>
and to feel a <hi>delighting satisfying</hi> virtue in his <hi>Love</hi> and gracious presence. To live as those that are <hi>not their own,</hi> and that have their <hi>lives,</hi> and <hi>faculties,</hi> and <hi>provisions,</hi> and <hi>helps</hi> for their <hi>Masters service:</hi> As a Horse or Dog is of so much <hi>worth,</hi> as he is <hi>of Use</hi> to him that owneth him; and that is the <hi>best</hi> that is the <hi>most serviceable</hi> to his Master: Yet with this very great difference, that <hi>man</hi> being a more noble and capacious creature, is admitted not only into a state <hi>of Service,</hi> but of <hi>Sonship,</hi> and <hi>Friendship,</hi> and <hi>Communion</hi> with God; and is allowed and appointed to share more in the pleasure and fruits of his services, and to put in <hi>his own feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city</hi> and <hi>delight</hi> into his <hi>End;</hi> not only because <hi>Self-love</hi> is <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>necessary</hi> to the Creature, but also because he is under the <hi>Promise</hi> of a Reward; and (more than either) because he is a <hi>Lover,</hi> and not only a <hi>Servant,</hi> and his work is principally a work of <hi>Love,</hi> and therefore his <hi>End</hi> is <hi>finis amantis,</hi> the <hi>end of a Lover,</hi> which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

[<hi>We are not care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to answer thee in this matter: If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But if not, be it known unto thee
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:59347:101"/>
O King that we will not serve thy gods nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.</hi>] Worldlings are ruled by their fleshly interest, and wisdom, and self-will, and by the will of man so far as it doth comporte with these: By these you may handle them and lead them up and down the world: By these doth Satan hold them in captivity. But believers feel them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in subjection to a higher Lord and better Law, which they faithfully though imperfectly observe: Therefore our <hi>walking with God</hi> is called A <hi>walking in his Law,</hi> Exod. 16. 4. A <hi>walking in his statutes, and keeping and doing his commands,</hi> Lev. 26. 3. A <hi>walking in his paths,</hi> Mic. 4. 2. It is our <hi>follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lamb, which way soever he goeth:</hi> To be <hi>given up to our own hearts lusts, and to walk in our counsels,</hi> is contrary to this holy <hi>walk with God,</hi> Psal. 81. 12. and is the course of those that are <hi>departed from him:</hi> And <hi>they that are far from him shall perish: he destroyeth those that go a whoring from him: But it is good for us to draw near to God,</hi> Psal. 73. 27, 28.</p>
                     <p>5. Our <hi>walking with God</hi> doth imply that as we are <hi>ruled</hi> by his <hi>Will,</hi> so we <hi>fear no punishment like his threatned displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure:</hi> and that the <hi>threats</hi> of <hi>death</hi> from mortal men, will not prevail with us so much as <hi>his threats of Hell,</hi> Luk. 12. 4. If God say, I will condemn thee to everlasting punishment if thou wilt not keep my Laws] And if men say, We will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn thee to imprisonment or death if thou keep them] the believer more feareth God than man: The Law of the King doth condemn <hi>Daniel</hi> to the Lyons den, if he <hi>forbear not to pray</hi> for a certain time. But he more feareth God that will deny those that deny him, and forsake those that forsake him: Therefore the forementioned witnesses ventured on the fiery furnace, because God threatned a more dreadful fire. Therefore a true believer <hi>dare not live,</hi> when an unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever dare not <hi>die:</hi> He <hi>dare not save his life from God</hi> lest he <hi>lose it;</hi> but <hi>loseth it</hi> that he may <hi>save</hi> it. But unbelievers that walk not with God, but <hi>after the flesh,</hi> do <hi>most fear</hi> them that they observe most <hi>powerful</hi> in the world, and will more be moved with the penalty of some worldly loss or suffering, then with Gods most dreadful threats of Hell: For that which they <hi>see not,</hi> is to them as <hi>nothing,</hi> while they want that <hi>faith</hi> by which it is <hi>foreknown,</hi> and must be escaped.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="167" facs="tcp:59347:101"/>6. Moreover he that <hi>walks with God,</hi> doth <hi>from God expect his full reward.</hi> He ceaseth not his holy course, though no man observe him, or none commend him or approve him; though all about him hate him and condemn him; though he be so far from <hi>gaining</hi> by it with <hi>men,</hi> that it <hi>cost him all that he hath or hoped for</hi> in the world: For he knoweth that <hi>Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is</hi> of it self <hi>great gain,</hi> and that it <hi>hath the promise of this life and that to come,</hi> and none can make Gods promise void: He knoweth that his <hi>Father which seeth in secret will reward him openly,</hi> Matth. 6. and that he <hi>shall have a treasure in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> that parteth with <hi>all on earth</hi> for Christ, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18. 22. And he hath such <hi>respect</hi> to this promised <hi>recompence of reward,</hi> that <hi>for it</hi> he can <hi>suffer with the people of God,</hi> and <hi>account the very reproach of Christ a greater treasure</hi> then Court or Country can afford <hi>him</hi> in a way of sin, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 26. He ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counteth them <hi>blessed that are persecuted for righteousness sake, because the Kingdom of Heaven is theirs.</hi> He judgeth it a cause of <hi>exceeding joy,</hi> to be <hi>reviled</hi> and <hi>persecuted,</hi> and to <hi>have all manner of evil falsly spoken of us for the sake of Christ, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause our reward in Heaven is great,</hi> Matth. 5. 10, 11, 12. For he verily believeth that as sure as these transitory pleasures will have an end, and everlastingly forsake those miserable souls that were deluded by them, so certainly is there a life of endless joyes, to be possessed in Heaven with God and all the Holy ones; and this he <hi>will trust to</hi> as that which will fully repair his losses and repay his cost, and not deceive him: Let others trust to what they will, it is this that he is resolved to trust to, and venture all to make it sure (when he is sure that <hi>All</hi> is Nothing which he ventureth, and that by the adventure he can never be a loser, nor never save by choosing that which it self must perish.) Thus he that truly walks with God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecteth his <hi>Reward from God, and with God,</hi> and thence is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged in all his duty, and thence is emboldned in all his conflicts, and thence is upheld and comforted in his sufferings: When <hi>Man</hi> is the <hi>Rewarder</hi> (as well as the chief Ruler) of the <hi>Hypocrite,</hi> and earthly things are the poise and motives to his earthly mind.</p>
                     <p>7. Our <hi>walking</hi> with God importeth that as we expect our <hi>Reward</hi> from him, so also <hi>that we take his Promise for our se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:59347:102"/>
for that Reward. Believing</hi> his <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>trusting</hi> his <hi>fidelity</hi> to the quieting and emboldening of the soul, is part of our holy walking with him. <hi>A promise of God</hi> is greater sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction and encouragement to a true believer, than all the <hi>visible</hi> things on earth: <hi>A promise of God</hi> can do more and prevail further with an upright soul, than all the <hi>sensible objects</hi> in the world. He will do more and go further upon such a <hi>promise,</hi> then he will for all that man can give him. Peruse the life of Christs Apostles and see what a <hi>promise</hi> of Christ can do; How it made them forsake all earthly pleasures, posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions and hopes, and part with friends, and houses, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and travail up and down the world, in dangers and suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and unwearied labours, despised and abused by great and small: and all this to preach the Gospel of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> which they had never <hi>seen,</hi> and to attain that Everlasting Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, and help others to attain it, for which they had nothing but the <hi>promise</hi> of their Lord. See what a <hi>promise</hi> well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved will make a Christian do and suffer. Believers did those noble acts, and the Martyrs under went those torments, which are mentioned <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. because <hi>they judged him faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful that had promised,</hi> Heb. 11. 11. They <hi>considered not</hi> difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and defect of means and improbabilities as to second causes, nor <hi>staggered at the promise of God through unbelief; but being strong in faith gave glory to God, being fully perswaded that what he had promised he was also able to perform.</hi>] As it is said of <hi>Abraham,</hi> Rom. 4. 19, 20, 21.</p>
                     <p>8. <hi>To walk with God,</hi> is <hi>to live as in his presence,</hi> and that with <hi>desire and delight.</hi> When we believe and apprehend that whereever we are, we are <hi>before the Lord,</hi> who <hi>seeth</hi> our hearts and all our waies; who <hi>knoweth</hi> every thought we think, and every word we speak, and every secret thing which we do: As verily to <hi>believe</hi> that <hi>God</hi> is <hi>here present</hi> and observeth all, as we do that we <hi>our selves</hi> are here: To compose our minds, our thoughts, our affections to that <hi>Holy reverence</hi> and <hi>serious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> as beseemeth <hi>man</hi> before his <hi>Maker:</hi> To order our <hi>words</hi> with that care and gravity as beseems those that speak in the <hi>hearing</hi> of the Lord. That no <hi>mans presence</hi> do seem more considerable to us then <hi>his</hi> presence: As we are not moved at the presence of a <hi>fly,</hi> or <hi>worm,</hi> or <hi>dog,</hi> when persons of honour
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:59347:102"/>
and reverence are present, so should we not comparatively be <hi>moved</hi> at the <hi>presence of man,</hi> how great, or rich, or terrible so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, when we know that <hi>God himself</hi> is <hi>present,</hi> to whom the greatest of the sons of men, is more inconsiderable then a fly or worm is unto them. As the presence of the <hi>King</hi> makes ordinary standers by to be unobserved, and the <hi>discourses</hi> of the <hi>learned</hi> make us disregard the <hi>bablings of children,</hi> so the <hi>presence of God</hi> should make the greatest to be <hi>scarce observed</hi> or regarded in comparison of <hi>him: God</hi> who is <hi>still with us</hi> should so much take up our regard, that all others in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence should be but as a <hi>candle</hi> in the presence of the <hi>sun.</hi> Therefore it is that a believer composeth himself to that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour which he knoweth <hi>God</hi> doth most expect, and beseem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth those that stand before him: when others accommodate themselves to the persons that are present, observing them, pleasing them, and shewing them respect, while they take no notice of God at all, as if they believed not that he is there. Hence it is that the men of God were wont to speak (though reverently yet) familiarly of God, as children of their Father with whom they <hi>dwell,</hi> as being indeed <hi>fellow-citizens with the Saints,</hi> who are his <hi>houshold: Abraham</hi> calleth him <hi>Gen.</hi> 24. 40. [<hi>The Lord before whom I walk.</hi>] And <hi>Jacob,</hi> Gen. 48. 15. <hi>God before whom my Fathers Abraham and Isaac walked.</hi>] And <hi>David</hi> resolveth, <hi>Psal.</hi> 116. 9. [<hi>I will walk before the Lord in the land of the living.</hi>] Yea God himself is pleased to use the terms of gracious condescending familiarity with them. <hi>Christ dwelleth in them by faith,</hi> Eph. 3. 17. <hi>His spirit dwelleth in them</hi> as his <hi>house</hi> and <hi>temple,</hi> Rom. 8. 9. <hi>Yea the Father himself</hi> is said to <hi>dwell in them, and they in him,</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 24. <hi>He that keepeth his Commandements dwelleth in Him, and He in him</hi>] and 3. 12. [<hi>If we love one another, God dwelleth in us</hi>] 13. [<hi>Hereby we know that we dwell in him, and He in us, because he hath given us of His spirit</hi>] 15. <hi>Whoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him and he in God</hi>] 16. [<hi>God is Love, and he that dwelleth in Love, dwelleth in God, and God in him.</hi>] Yea God is said to <hi>walk in them,</hi> as they are said to <hi>walk with</hi> Him: 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 16. [<hi>For ye are the Temple of the living God; as God hath said I will dwell in them, and walk in them, and I will be their God and they shall be my people.</hi>]</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="170" facs="tcp:59347:103"/>Our <hi>walking with God</hi> then is not only a sense of that <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon presence</hi> which he must needs afford to all; but it is also a believing apprehension of his <hi>Gracious presence,</hi> as <hi>our God</hi> and reconciled Father, with whom <hi>we dwell,</hi> being <hi>brought near unto Him by Christ;</hi> and who dwelleth in us by his <hi>spirit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>9. To <hi>walk with God</hi> (as here we are in flesh) includeth not only our <hi>believing his presence,</hi> but also that we <hi>see him</hi> (as the <hi>chief cause</hi> in the <hi>effects) in his creatures and his daily provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> that we look not on <hi>creatures</hi> as <hi>independent</hi> or <hi>separat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> from <hi>God;</hi> but see them as the <hi>Glass,</hi> and <hi>God</hi> as the <hi>repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented face;</hi> and see them as the <hi>letters</hi> and <hi>words,</hi> and <hi>God</hi> as the <hi>sense</hi> of all the creatures that are the <hi>first Book</hi> which he appointed man to read. We must behold <hi>his glory declared</hi> by the <hi>Heavens,</hi> Psal. 19. 1. and see <hi>Him shining</hi> in the <hi>Sun;</hi> and see <hi>his Power</hi> in the Fabrick of the world, and <hi>his wisdom</hi> in the admirable order of the whole: we must tast the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of <hi>his Love</hi> in the sweetness of our <hi>food,</hi> and in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of our <hi>friends,</hi> and all our accommodations we must <hi>see,</hi> and <hi>Love his Image</hi> in his Holy ones; and we must hear <hi>his Voice</hi> in the Ministry of his Messengers. Thus <hi>every creature</hi> must become a <hi>Preacher</hi> to us, and we must see the <hi>Name of God upon it:</hi> and thus <hi>all things will be sanctified to us,</hi> while <hi>Holiness to the Lord</hi> is written upon all. Though we must not therefore make Idols of the creatures, because God appeareth to us in them, yet must we hear the <hi>message</hi> which <hi>they</hi> bring us, and reverence in them the <hi>Name</hi> of the Creatour which they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ear. By <hi>this way</hi> of conversing with them, they will not ensnare us, or deceive, or poyson us, as they do the carnal unbelieving world: but as the Fish brought money to <hi>Peter</hi> to pay his tribute, so every creature would bring us a greater, even a spiritual gain. When we behold it, we should say with pleasant admiration [<hi>This is the work of God, and it is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful in our eyes.</hi>] This is the <hi>true Divine Philosophy,</hi> which <hi>seeketh,</hi> and <hi>findeth,</hi> and <hi>contemplateth,</hi> and <hi>admireth</hi> the <hi>Great Creatour</hi> in his works: When that which sticketh in the <hi>creature it self</hi> (whatever discovery it seem to make) is but a childish unprofitable trifling: like learning to shape all the letters aright, without learning to know their signification
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:59347:103"/>
and sense. It is God appearing in the creatures, that is the life, and beauty, and use, and excellency of all the creatures; wthout him they are but carkasses, deformed, useless, vain, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>significant and very nothings.</p>
                     <p>10. Our <hi>walking with God,</hi> doth contain <hi>our willing and sincere attendance on him in the use of those holy duties in which he hath appointed us to expect his grace.</hi> He is everywhere in his <hi>essential presence,</hi> but he is not everywhere alike to be found in the communications of his grace. The <hi>assemblies</hi> of <hi>his Saints</hi> that worship him in <hi>holy communion,</hi> are places where he is likelyer to be found, then in an Ale-house or a Play-house. You are likelier to have holy converse with him among the <hi>holy,</hi> that will speak of holy things to your edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then among the senseless ignorant sensualists, and the scornful enemies of Holiness, that are the servants of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, whom he useth in his daily work for the deceiving and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the world. Therefore the conversation of the wicked doth <hi>grieve,</hi> and <hi>vex a righteous soul</hi> (as its said the Sodomites did by <hi>Lot,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 7, 8.) because all their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation is ungodly, far from God, not savouring of any true knowledge of him, or love to him, but is <hi>against him</hi> by enmity and provocation. If God himself do <hi>dwell</hi> and <hi>walk</hi> in all his holy ones, then they that <hi>dwell</hi> and <hi>walk</hi> with them, have the best opportunity to <hi>dwell</hi> and <hi>walk</hi> with God. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse with <hi>those in whom God dwelleth,</hi> is to converse with <hi>him in his Image,</hi> and to attend him at <hi>his dwelling:</hi> And willfully to run among the wicked, is to run far away from God. <hi>In his Temple doth every man speak of his Glory,</hi> Psal. 29. 9. when among his brutish enemies every man speaketh to the disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of him in his word and wayes. He is otherwise present with those that are congregated in his Name and for his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, then he is with those that are assembled for wickedness or vanity, or live as brutes without God in the world. And we must <hi>draw as near him</hi> as we can, if we would be such as walk with God.</p>
                     <p>We must not be strange to him in <hi>our Thoughts,</hi> but make <hi>him</hi> the object of our most <hi>serious meditations:</hi> Its said of the wicked that <hi>they are far from God;</hi> and that <hi>God is not in all their thoughts,</hi> Ps. 73. 27. Ps. 10. 4. The <hi>thoughts</hi> are the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:59347:104"/>
minds employment. It <hi>dwells</hi> on that which it frequently thinks of. It is a <hi>walk</hi> of the <hi>Mind,</hi> and not of the <hi>Body</hi> which we are treating of. To <hi>mind</hi> the <hi>world,</hi> and <hi>fleshly things,</hi> is contrary to this <hi>walk with God:</hi> we are far from him, when our <hi>thoughts</hi> are (ordinarily) far from him. I know that it is lawful and meet to think of the business of our callings, so far as is necessary to the prudent successful man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement of them: and that it is not requisite that our thoughts be alwaies <hi>actually</hi> upon <hi>God:</hi> but he that doth manage his calling in Holiness, doth all in obedience to Gods commands, and sees that his work be the work of God, and he intendeth all to the glory of God, or the pleasing of his blessed will: and he oft reneweth these actual intentions; and oft interposeth thoughts of the presence, or power, or love, or interest of him whom he is serving: He often lifteth up his soul in some holy desire or ejaculatory request to God: He oft taketh occasion from what he seeth, or heareth, or is doing, for some more spiritual meditation or discourse: so that still it is <hi>God</hi> that his mind is principally employed <hi>on</hi> or <hi>for,</hi> even in his ordinary work, (while he liveth as a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian.)</p>
                     <p>And it is not enough to <hi>think of God;</hi> but we must <hi>think of him as God,</hi> with such <hi>respect,</hi> and <hi>reverence,</hi> and <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>trust,</hi> and <hi>submission</hi> (in our measure) as is due from the Creature to his Creator. For as <hi>some kind</hi> of <hi>speaking</hi> of him is but a <hi>taking his Name in vain:</hi> so <hi>some kind</hi> of <hi>thinking</hi> of him is but a dishonouring of him, by contemptuous or false unworthy thoughts. Most of our walking with God consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in such affectionate apprehensions of him as are suitable to his blessed Attributes and Relations. All the day long our thoughts should be working either <hi>on God,</hi> or <hi>for God:</hi> either upon some work of obedience which he hath imposed on us, and in which we desire to please and honour him, or else di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly upon himself. Our hearts must be taken up in contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plating and admiring him, in magnifying his Name, his Word and Works; and in pleasant contentful thoughts of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity, and of his Glory, and the Glory which he conferreth on his Saints. He that is unskilful or unable to manage his own thoughts with some activity, seriousness and order, will be a
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:59347:104"/>
stranger to much of the holy converse which believers have with God. They that have given up the Government of their thoughts, and turned them loose to go which way phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasie pleaseth, and present sensitive objects do invite them, and to run up and down the world as masterless unruly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grants, can hardly expect to keep them in any constant atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon God, or readiness for any sacred work. And the <hi>sudden thoughts</hi> which they <hi>have</hi> of God, will be <hi>rude</hi> and <hi>stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid,</hi> savouring more of prophane contempt, than of holiness, when they should be <hi>reverent, serious, affectionate</hi> and <hi>practical,</hi> and such as conduce to a holy composure of their hearts and lives.</p>
                     <p>And as we must walk with God, 1. In <hi>our communion with his servants,</hi> 2. And in <hi>our affectionate Meditations;</hi> so also 3 In <hi>all the ordinances</hi> which he hath appointed for our Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and his Worship.</p>
                     <p>1. The <hi>Reading of the Word of God,</hi> and the <hi>explication</hi> and <hi>application</hi> of it in <hi>good Books,</hi> is a means to possess the mind with sound, and orderly, and working apprehensions of God, and of his holy Truths: So that in such <hi>Reading</hi> our understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are oft illustrated with a heavenly Light, and our hearts are touched with a special delightful rellish of that truth, and they are secretly attracted and engaged unto God, and all the powers of our souls are excited and animated to a holy obedient life.</p>
                     <p>2. The same <hi>Word preached</hi> with a lively voice, with clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and affection, hath a <hi>greater</hi> advantage for the same illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination and excitation of the soul. When a Minister of Christ that is truly a <hi>Divine,</hi> being filled with the <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> of God, shall copiously and affectionately open to his hearers the excellencies which he hath <hi>seen,</hi> and the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness which he hath <hi>foreseen</hi> and <hi>tasted</hi> of himself, it frequently (through the co-operation of the Spirit of Christ) doth wrap up the hearers hearts to God, and bring them into a more lively knowledge of him, actuating their graces, and enflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their hearts with a heavenly Love, and such desires as God hath promised to satisfie. Christ doth not only send his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters furnished with <hi>Authority</hi> from him, but also furnished with <hi>his Spirit,</hi> to speak of spiritual things in a spiritual man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:59347:105"/>
so that in both respects he might say [<hi>He that heareth you heareth mee:</hi>] and also by the same Spirit doth open and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite the hearts of the hearers: so that it is <hi>God himself</hi> that a serious Christian is principally employed with, in the hearing of his heavenly transforming Word: And therefore he is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with reverence and holy fear, with some taste of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly delight, with obediential subjection and resignation of himself to God. The <hi>Word of God is powerful,</hi> not only in <hi>pulling down all high exalting thoughts,</hi> that rise up against God, but also in lifting up depressed souls, that are unable to rise unto heavenly knowledge, or communion with God. If some Christians could but alwaies finde as much of God upon their hearts at other times, as they finde sometimes under a spiritual powerful Ministry, they would not so complain that they seem forsaken, and strangers to all communion with God, as many of them do. While <hi>God</hi> (by his <hi>Messengers</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi>) is <hi>speaking,</hi> and <hi>man</hi> is <hi>hearing him;</hi> while <hi>God</hi> is trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with <hi>man</hi> about his reconciliation and everlasting happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and <hi>man</hi> is seriously attending to the treaty and motions of his Lord, surely this is a very considerable part of our walking and converse with God.</p>
                     <p>3. Also in the <hi>Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ,</hi> we are called to a familiar converse with God: He there appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to us by a wonderful condescension in the representing, communicating signs of the flesh and blood of his Son, in which he hath most conspicuously revealed his Love and Goodness to Believers: There Christ himself with his Covenant-gifts are all delivered to us by these Investing signs of his own institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; even as <hi>Knighthood</hi> is given by a <hi>sword,</hi> and as a <hi>House</hi> is delivered by a <hi>Key,</hi> or <hi>Land</hi> by a <hi>Twig and Turf.</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where is <hi>God</hi> so <hi>near</hi> to man as in <hi>Jesus Christ:</hi> and nowhere is <hi>Christ</hi> so familiarly represented to us, as in this holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Here we are called to sit with him at his Table, as his invited welcome guests; to commemorate his sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, to feed upon his very flesh and blood; that is, with our mouths upon his Representative flesh and blood, and with our <hi>applying Faith</hi> upon his <hi>real flesh and blood,</hi> by such a <hi>feeding</hi> as belongs to <hi>Faith.</hi> The Marriage-Covenant betwixt God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="175" facs="tcp:59347:105"/>
and solemnized. There we are entertained by God as <hi>friends,</hi> and not as servants only, and that at the most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious costly feast. If ever a believer may on earth expect his kindest entertainment, and near access, and a humble intimacy with his Lord, it is in the participation of this <hi>sacrifice-feast,</hi> which is called [<hi>The Communion</hi>] because it is appointed as well for our <hi>special Communion</hi> with <hi>Christ</hi> as with <hi>one another.</hi> It is here that we have the fullest <hi>intimation, expression</hi> and <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication</hi> of the wondrous Love of God; and therefore it is here that we have the loudest call, and best assistance to make a large return of <hi>Love:</hi> And where there is the most of <hi>this Love</hi> between <hi>God</hi> and <hi>man,</hi> there is most <hi>Communion,</hi> and most of <hi>Heaven,</hi> that can be had on Earth.</p>
                     <p>But it much concerneth the members of Christ, that they deprive not themselves of this Communion with God in this <hi>Holy Sacrament</hi> through their miscarriage; which is too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently done by one of these extreams. Either by rushing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on holy things with a presumptuous careless common frame of heart, as if they knew not that they go to feast with Christ, and discerned not his body: or else by an excess of fear, drawing back, and questioning the good will of God, and thinking diminutively of his love and mercy: By this means Satan depriveth many of the <hi>comfortable part</hi> of their commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God, both in this Sacrament, and in other waies of grace; and maketh them avoid him as an enemy, and be loth to come into his special presence; and even to be afraid to think of him, to pray to him, or to have any holy converse with him: When the just belief and observation of his Love would stablish them, and revive their souls with joy, and give them experience of the sweet delights which are opened to them in the Gospel, and which believers finde in the Love of God, and the foretast of the everlasting pleasures.</p>
                     <p>4. In <hi>holy, faithful, servent Prayer</hi> a Christian hath very much of his converse with God. For <hi>Prayer</hi> is our approach to God, and calling to mind his presence and his attributes, and exercising all his graces in a holy motion towards him, and an exciting all the powers of our souls to seek him, attend him, &amp; reverently to worship him: It is our treating with him about the most important businesses in all the world: a be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ging of
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:59347:106"/>
the greatest mercies, and a deprecating his most grievous judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and all this with the nearest familiarity that man in flesh can have with God. In prayer the Spirit of God is working up our hearts unto him, with desires exprest in sighs and groans: It is a work of <hi>God</hi> as well as of <hi>man: He</hi> blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the fire, though it be <hi>our hearts</hi> that burn and boil. In <hi>Prayer</hi> we lay hold on Jesus Christ, and plead his merits and intercession with the Father: He taketh us as it wereby the hand, and leadeth us unto God, and hideth our sins, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureth our acceptance, and presenteth us amiable to his Father, having justified and sanctified us, and cleansed us from those pollutions, which rendered us loathsome and abominable. To speak to God in serious prayer, is a work so high, and of so great moment, that it calleth off our minds from all things else, and giveth no creature room or leave to look into the soul, or once to be observed: The mind is so taken up with God, and employed with him, that creatures are forgotten, and we take no notice of them (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less when through the diversions of the flesh, our prayers are interrupted and corrupted, and so far degenerate, and are no prayer; so far I say as we thus turn away from God.) So that the soul that is most and best at Prayer, is most and best at walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with God, and hath most communion with him in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: And to withdraw from <hi>Prayer,</hi> is to withdraw from God: And to be <hi>unwilling</hi> to <hi>pray,</hi> is to be unwilling to draw near to God. <hi>Meditation</hi> or <hi>Contemplation</hi> is a duty in which God is much enjoyed: But <hi>Prayer</hi> hath <hi>Meditation</hi> in it, and much more. All that is upon the mind in <hi>Meditation,</hi> is upon the mind in <hi>Prayer,</hi> and that with great advantage, as being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented before God, and pleaded with him, and so animated by the apprehensions of his observing presence, and actuated by the desires and pleadings of the soul. When we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to <hi>Pray,</hi> it includeth a command to <hi>Repent</hi> and <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,</hi> and <hi>Fear the Lord,</hi> and <hi>Desire</hi> his Grace: For <hi>Faith and Repentance,</hi> and <hi>Fear</hi> and <hi>Desire,</hi> are altogether in action in a serious prayer; And, as it were, naturally each one takes his place, and there is a <hi>holy order</hi> in the acting of these gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in a Christians prayers, and a harmony<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which he doth seldome himself observe. He that in <hi>Meditation</hi> knoweth not
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:59347:106"/>
how to be regular and methodical, when he is studiously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving and endeavouring it, yet in <hi>Prayer</hi> before he is aware, hath <hi>Repentance, and Faith, and Fear, and Desire,</hi> and every grace fall in its proper place and order, and contribute its part to the performance of the work. The <hi>new nature</hi> of a Christian is more immediately and vigorously operative in <hi>Prayer,</hi> than in many other duties: And therefore every In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant in the family of God can <hi>pray</hi> (with groaning <hi>desires,</hi> and ordered graces, if not with well-ordered <hi>words:</hi>) When <hi>Paul</hi> began to <hi>live</hi> to Christ, he began (aright) to <hi>pray: Behold he prayeth,</hi> saith God to <hi>Ananias,</hi> Act. 9. 11. And <hi>because they are Sons, God sends the Spirit of his Son into the hearts of his Elect, even the Spirit of Adoption, by which they cry Abba Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> Gal. 4. 6. as <hi>children naturally</hi> cry to their <hi>Parents</hi> for relief. And <hi>Nature</hi> is more regular in its works than Art or humane contrivance is. <hi>Necessity</hi> teacheth many a beggar to pray better for relief to men, than many learned men (that feel not their necessities)<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> can pray to God. The Spirit of God is a better Methodist than we are: And though I know that we are bound to use our utmost care and skill for the <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly actuating</hi> of each holy <hi>affection</hi> in our <hi>Prayers,</hi> and not pretend the sufficiency of the Spirit for the patronage of our negligence or sloth (for the Spirit makes use of our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings for the actuating of our wills and affections;) yet withall it cannot be denied, but that it was upon a special rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that the Spirit that is promised to Believers is called a <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Grace and Supplication,</hi> Zech. 12. 10. And that it is given us to <hi>help our infirmities,</hi> even the infirmities of our <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,</hi> when <hi>we know not what to pray for as we ought,</hi> Rom. 8. 26. And that the <hi>Spirit it self</hi> is said to <hi>make intercession for us, with groanings which cannot be uttered.</hi> It is not the <hi>Spirit without</hi> that is here meant: such <hi>intercession</hi> is nowhere ascribed to that. How then is the <hi>Prayer</hi> of the <hi>Spirit within us</hi> distinguished from <hi>our Prayer?</hi> Not as different effects of different causes: as <hi>different prayers</hi> by these different parties: But as the <hi>same prayer</hi> proceeding from <hi>different causes,</hi> having a special force (for quality and degree) as from <hi>one cause</hi> (the Spirit) which it hath not from the <hi>other cause</hi> (from our selves) except as received from the Spirit. The <hi>Spirit</hi> is as a
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:59347:107"/>
                        <hi>New Nature,</hi> or <hi>fixed inclination</hi> in the Saints: For their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>self-love</hi> and <hi>will</hi> to <hi>good</hi> is sanctified in them, which works so readily (though voluntarily) as that it is in a sort by the way of <hi>Nature,</hi> though not excluding Reason and Will; and not as the motion of the brutish appetite. And that God is their fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, and the only help and comfort of their souls, and so the principal Good to be desired by them, is become to them a truth so certain, and beyond all doubt, that their understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are convinced that <hi>Velle Bonum, &amp; Velle Deum,</hi> to <hi>Love Good,</hi> and to <hi>Love God,</hi> are words that have almost the same signification; and therefore here is no room for <hi>deliberation</hi> and <hi>choice,</hi> where there is <hi>omnimoda ratio boni,</hi> nothing but unquestionable good. A Christian (so far as he is such) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not chuse but desire the favour and fruition of God in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, even as he cannot chuse (because he is a man) but desire his own felicity in general: And as he cannot (as a man) but be unwilling of destruction, and cannot but fear ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent misery, and that which bringeth it; so as a Christian he cannot chuse but be unwilling of damnation, and of the wrath of God, and of sin as sin, and fear the apparent dangers of his soul, so that his <hi>New Nature</hi> will presently cast his <hi>Fear,</hi> and <hi>Repentance,</hi> and <hi>Desires</hi> into their proper course and order, and set them on work on their several objects (about the main unquestionable things, however they may erre, or need more deliberation about things doubtful:) The <hi>New Creature</hi> is not as a <hi>lifeless Engine</hi> (as a <hi>Clock,</hi> or <hi>Watch,</hi> or <hi>Ship</hi>) where every part must be set in order by the art and hand of man, and so kept and used: But it is liker to the frame of our <hi>own nature,</hi> even like <hi>man</hi> who is a <hi>living Engine,</hi> when every part is set in its place and order by the <hi>Creatour,</hi> and hath in it self a living and harmonical principle, which disposeth it to <hi>action,</hi> and to <hi>regular action,</hi> and is so to be kept in <hi>order</hi> and daily <hi>exercise</hi> by <hi>our selves,</hi> as yet to be principally ordered and actuated, by the Spirit which is the principal cause.</p>
                     <p>By all which you may understand how the Holy Ghost is in us a spirit of Supplication, and helpeth of our infirmities, and teacheth us to pray, and intercedeth in us; and also that <hi>Prayer</hi> is to the <hi>New Man,</hi> so natural a motion of the soul to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:59347:107"/>
God, that much of our <hi>walking with God</hi> is exercised in this holy duty: And that it is to the <hi>New Life,</hi> as <hi>breathing</hi> to our <hi>Natural Life;</hi> and therefore no wonder that we are commanded to <hi>pray continually,</hi> 1 These 5. 17. as we must <hi>breath</hi> continually, or as nature which needeth a daily supply of food for nourishment, hath a daily appetite to the food which it needeth, so hath the <hi>Spiritual Nature</hi> to its necessary food, and nothing but sickness doth take it off.</p>
                     <p>And thus I have shewed you how our <hi>walking with God</hi> containeth a holy use of his appointed means.</p>
                     <p>II. To <hi>walk with God</hi> includeth our <hi>Dependence on him for our Receivings, and taking our Mercies as from his hand.</hi> To live as upon <hi>his Love</hi> and <hi>Bounty;</hi> as Children with their Father, that can look for nothing but from <hi>him.</hi> As the eye of a Servant, yea of a craving Dog, is upon his Masters face and hand, so must our eye be on the Lord, for the gracious supply of all our wants. If <hi>men</hi> give us any thing, we take them but as the Messengers of God, by whom he sendeth it us: We will not be unthankful unto <hi>men;</hi> but we thank them but for <hi>bringing us</hi> our Fathers gifts. Indeed man is so much more than a meer Messenger, as that his <hi>own Charity</hi> also is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised in the gift. A <hi>meer Messenger</hi> is to do no more but obedientlly to deliver what is sent us, and he need not exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise any Charity of his own; and we owe him thanks only for his <hi>fidelity</hi> and <hi>labour,</hi> but only to his <hi>Master</hi> for the <hi>gift:</hi> But <hi>God</hi> will so far honour <hi>man,</hi> as that he shall be called also to use <hi>his Charity,</hi> and distribute his Masters gifts with some <hi>self-denial;</hi> and we owe <hi>him thanks,</hi> as under God; he par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taketh in the <hi>Charity</hi> of the <hi>Gift;</hi> and as one childe oweth thanks to another, who both in obedience to the <hi>Father,</hi> and Love to his Brother, doth give some part of that which his Father had given him before. But still it is from our <hi>Fathers Bounty,</hi> as the principal cause that all proceeds. Thus <hi>Jacob</hi> speaketh of God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 48. 15. [<hi>God, before whom my Fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God which fed mee all my life long unto this day, the Angel which redeemed mee from all evil, bless the Lads, &amp;c.</hi>] When he had mentioned his Father <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Isaac's walking with God,</hi> he describeth his <hi>own</hi> by his dependence upon God, and receiving from him, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:59347:108"/>
him the God that had fed him, and delivered him all his life. Carnal men that live by sense, do depend upon inferiour sensible causes; and though they are taught to <hi>pray to God,</hi> and thank him with their tongues, it is indeed their own contrivances and industry, or their visible benefactors, which their hearts depend upon and thank. It were a shame to them to be so plain as <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and to say, <hi>Who is the Lord?</hi> or to speak as openly as <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> and say, <hi>Is not this great Babylon that I have built, by the might of my power<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c.</hi> D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>n. 4 30. Yet the same Atheism and Self-idolizing is in their hearts, though it be more modestly and cunningly exprest. Hence it is that they that <hi>walk with God,</hi> have all their Receivings sanctified to them, and have in all a Divine and spiritual sweetness, which those that take them but as from Creatures, do never feel or understand.</p>
                     <p>12. Lastly it is contained in our <hi>Walking with God,</hi> that the <hi>greatest business of our lives be with Him,</hi> and <hi>for him.</hi> It is not a walk for <hi>complement</hi> or <hi>recreation only</hi> that is here meant; but it is a life of nearness, converse and employment, as a servant or child that dwelleth with his Master or Father in the house. God should be alwayes so regarded, that <hi>Man</hi> should stand by as <hi>Nothing,</hi> and be scarce observed in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of Him. We should begin the day with God, and entertain Him in the first and sweetest of our thoughts: we should <hi>walk abroad</hi> and do our work as in his sight: we must resolve to do no work but <hi>His,</hi> no not in our trades and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary callings: we must be able to say, It is the work which my Master set me to do, and I do it to obey and please his <hi>Will.</hi> At night we must take an account of our selves, and spread open that account before him, desiring his acceptance of what was well, and his pardon for what we did amiss, that we may thus be ready for our last account. In a word, though <hi>Men</hi> be our fellow-labourers and companions, yet the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal business of our Care and Diligence, must be our Masters service in the world. And therefore we must look about us, and discern the <hi>opportunities</hi> of serving him, and of the best im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of his talents; and must make it our <hi>daily<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> study</hi> and <hi>business,</hi> to do him the <hi>greatest service</hi> we are able, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it may cost us through the malice of the enemies, being
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:59347:108"/>
                        <hi>sure</hi> our labour shall not be in vain, and that we cannot serve him at too dear a rate. It is not as idle companions, but as servants, as souldiers, as those that put forth all their strength, to do his work and reach the Crown, that we are called to <hi>walk with God.</hi> And all this is done, though not in the same degree by all, yet according to the measure of their Holiness by every one that lives by faith.</p>
                     <p>Having told you what it is to <hi>Walk with God,</hi> as to the <hi>Matter</hi> of it, I shall more briefly tell you as to the <hi>Manner:</hi> The <hi>nature</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> of <hi>man,</hi> and of the <hi>work,</hi> will tell it you.</p>
                     <p>1. That our walk with God must be with the <hi>greatest reverence:</hi> were we never so much assured of his special love to us, and never so full of <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>joy,</hi> our <hi>reverence</hi> must be never the less for this. Though <hi>Love</hi> cast out that guilty fear which discourageth the sinner from hoping and seeking for the mercy which would save him, and which disposeth him to hate and fly from God, yet doth it not cast out that <hi>Reverence</hi> of God, which we owe him as his creatures so infinitely below him as we are. It cannot be that God should be known and remembred as God, without some admiring and awful appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions of him. Infiniteness, Omnipotency and inaccessible Majesty and Glory, must needs affect the soul that knoweth them, with reverence and selfe-abasement. Though <hi>we receive a Kingdome that cannot be moved,</hi> yet if we will <hi>serve God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptably,</hi> we must <hi>serve him with reverence and godly fear,</hi> as knowing that as he <hi>is our God,</hi> so <hi>he is</hi> also a <hi>consuming fire,</hi> Heb. 12. 28, 29. We must so worship him as those that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that we are <hi>worms</hi> and <hi>guilty sinners,</hi> and that he is <hi>most High and Holy,</hi> and will be <hi>sanctified in them that come nigh him, and before all the people he will be glorified,</hi> Lev. 10. 3. <hi>Unreverence</hi> sheweth a kind of <hi>Atheistical contempt</hi> of God, or else a sleepiness and inconsiderateness of the soul. The sense of the <hi>Goodness</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> must consist with the sense of his <hi>Holiness</hi> and <hi>Omnipotency.</hi> It is presumption, pride or blockish stupidity, which excludeth <hi>Reverence;</hi> which <hi>Faith</hi> doth <hi>cause,</hi> and not <hi>oppose.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. Our <hi>walking with God</hi> must be a work of <hi>humble boldness</hi> and <hi>familiarity.</hi> The <hi>Reverence</hi> of his <hi>Holiness</hi> and <hi>Greatness,</hi> must not overcome or exclude the sense of his <hi>Goodness</hi> and
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:59347:109"/>
                        <hi>compassion,</hi> nor the <hi>full assurance of faith</hi> and <hi>hope.</hi> Though <hi>by sin</hi> we are enemies and strange to God, and stand a far off, yet <hi>in Christ</hi> we are reconciled to him and brought near, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 13. <hi>For he is our Peace, who hath taken down the partition, and abolished the enmity, and reconciled Jew and Gentile unto God.</hi> Ver. 14, 15, 16. <hi>And through him we have all an access to the Father by one spirit: we are now no more strangers and forraigners, but fellow-Citizens of the Saints and of the houshold of God:</hi> ver. 18, 19. <hi>In him we have boldness and access with confidence by the belief of him,</hi> Eph. 3. 12. Though of our selves we are unworthy to be called his children, and may well stand a far off with the Publican, and not dare to lift up our faces towards heaven, but smite our breasts and say, <hi>O Lord be merciful to me a sinner.</hi>] Yet <hi>have we boldness to enter into the Holiest, by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way which he hath consecrated for us, through the vail, that is to say, his flesh: And having an high Priest over the house of God, we may draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith.</hi>] Heb. 10. 19, 20, 21, 22. <hi>Therefore whensoever</hi> we are afraid at the sight of sin and Justice, let us remember that <hi>we have a great high Priest that is passed into the heavens, even Jesus the Son of God: and therefore let us come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need,</hi>] Heb. 4. 14, 15, 16. He that alloweth us to <hi>walk with him,</hi> doth allow us such humble familiarity as beseemeth those that walk together with him.</p>
                     <p>3. Our <hi>walking with God</hi> must be a work of some <hi>holy plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and delight.</hi> We may unwillingly be <hi>drag'd</hi> into the presence of an <hi>enemy,</hi> and serve as drudges upon meer necessity or fear. But <hi>walking together</hi> is the loving and delightful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse of friends. When we <hi>take sweet counsel</hi> of the Lord, and <hi>set him alwaies as at our right hand,</hi> and are glad to hear from him, and glad to speak to him, and glad to withdraw our thoughts from all the things and persons in the world, that we may solace our selves in the contemplations of his excellency, and the admirations of his Love and Glory, this is indeed to <hi>walk with God.</hi> You converse with him as with a stranger, an enemy, or your destroyer, and not as with God, while you had rather be far from him, and only <hi>tremble</hi> in his presence,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:59347:109"/>
and are glad when you have done and are got away, but have no delight or pleasure in him. If we can take delight in our walking with a <hi>friend,</hi> a friend that is truly loving and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, a friend that is learned, wise and holy! if their wise and heavenly discourse be better to us, then our recreations, meat, or drink, or clothes! what <hi>delight</hi> then should we find in our secret converse with the most high, most wise and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious God! How glad should we be to find him willing and ready to entertain us? How glad should we be that we may employ our thoughts on so high and excellent an object? what cause have we to say, [<hi>My meditation of him shall be sweet, and I will be glad in the Lord,</hi> Ps. 104. 34. <hi>In the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of my thoughts within me</hi> (my sorrowful, troublesome, weary thoughts) <hi>thy comforts do delight my soul,</hi> Ps. 94. 19. Let others take pleasure in childish vanity, or sensuality, but say thou as <hi>David,</hi> Ps. 119. 14, 15, 16.

                     <p>4. Our <hi>walking with God</hi> must be a matter of <hi>industry</hi> and

                        <hi>diligence:</hi> It is not an occasional idle converse, but a life of <hi>observance, obedience</hi> and <hi>imployment,</hi> that this phrase import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. The sluggish idle <hi>wishes</hi> of the <hi>hypocrite,</hi> whose hands re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to labour, are not this walking with God: nor the <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of fools,</hi> who are hasty to utter the overflowings of their fantasie before the Lord, while they <hi>keep not their foot,</hi> nor <hi>hearken to the Law,</hi> nor <hi>consider that they do evil</hi>] Eccles. 5. 1, 2, 3. <hi>He that cometh to God</hi> (and will walk with him) <hi>must believe that he is, and that he is the rewarder of them that diligently seek him: God is with you while you are with him; but if you forsake him, he will forsake you,</hi> 2 Chron. 15. 2. <hi>Up and be doing, and the Lord will be with you,</hi> 1 Chron. 22. 16.

                     <p>5. Our <hi>walking with God</hi> is a matter of some <hi>Constancy:</hi> It signifieth our <hi>course</hi> and <hi>trade</hi> of <hi>life,</hi> and not some acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal action on the by: A man may walk with a <hi>stranger</hi> for a <hi>Visit,</hi> or in <hi>Complement,</hi> or upon some unusual occasion: But this walk with God, is the act of those that <hi>dwell with him</hi> in his <hi>Family,</hi> and do his <hi>work.</hi> It is not only to step and speak with him, or cry to him for mercy in some great extremity, or to go to Church for company or custome, or think or talk of him sometime heartlesly on the by, as a man will talk of news, or matters that are done in a forein Land, or of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that we think we have little to do with: But it is to <hi>be alwaies with him,</hi> Luk. 15. 31. <hi>To seek first his Kingdom and Righteousness,</hi> Matth. 6. 33. <hi>Not to labour</hi> (comparatively) <hi>for the food that perisheth, but for that which endureth to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting life,</hi> Joh. 6. 27. <hi>To delight in the Law of the Lord, and meditate in it day and night,</hi> Psal. 1. 2.

                     <p>And first it acquainteth us with the abundance of <hi>Atheism</hi> that is in the world, even among those that profess the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God. It is <hi>Atheism</hi> not only to <hi>say, There is no God:</hi> but to say so <hi>in the heart.</hi> Psal. 14. 1. While the heart is no more affected towards him, observant of him, or consident in him, or submissive to him, than if indeed there were no God: When there is nothing of God upon the Heart, no Love, no Fear, no Trust, no Subjection, then is <hi>Heart-Atheism.</hi> When men that have some kind of <hi>knowledge of God,</hi> yet <hi>glorifie</hi> him not <hi>as God,</hi> nor <hi>are thankful to him, but become vain in their imaginations, and their foolish hearts are darkened;</hi> these men are <hi>Heart-Atheists,</hi> and <hi>professing themselves wise, they become fools,</hi> and are <hi>given up to vile affections: And as they do not like to retain God in their knowledge</hi> (however they may dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of him, so) <hi>God</hi> oft <hi>giveth them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things that are not convenient, being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, malicious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, envy, murther, debate, deceit, malignity, &amp;c.</hi> Rom. 1. 21, 22, 26, 28, 29, 30. Swarms of such <hi>Atheists</hi> go up and down under the self-deceiving name of <hi>Christians:</hi> being indeed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing and defiled, so void of <hi>Purity,</hi> that they deride it, and <hi>nothing is Pure to them; but even their mind and conscience is defiled: They profess that they know God, but they deny him in their works, being abominable and disobedient, and to every good work reprobate,</hi> Tit. 1. 15, 16. What is he but an <hi>Atheist,</hi> when <hi>God is not in all his thoughts,</hi> Psal. 10. 4. unless it be in their <hi>impious</hi> or <hi>blaspheming thoughts,</hi> or in their <hi>sleight con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuous</hi> thoughts! To take <hi>God for God</hi> indeed, and for <hi>our God,</hi> essentially includeth the taking him to be the <hi>most power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, wist and good,</hi> the <hi>most just and holy,</hi> the <hi>Creator, Preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:59347:111"/>
and Governour of the world,</hi> whom we and all men are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged absolutely to obey and fear, to love and desire, whose <hi>Will</hi> is our <hi>Beginning, Rule</hi> and <hi>End:</hi> He that taketh not God for such as here described, taketh him not for <hi>God,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is indeed an <hi>Atheist:</hi> What name soever he assumeth to himself, this is the name that <hi>God</hi> will call him by; even a <hi>fool that hath said in his heart there is no God:</hi> while <hi>they are corrupt and do abominably, they understand not, and seek not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter God; they are all gone aside, and are altogether become filthy, there is none of them that doth good; they are workers of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that have no knowledge, and eat up the people of God as bread, and call not upon the Lord,</hi> Psal. 14. 1, 2, 3, 4. [<hi>Ungodliness</hi>] is but the English for [<hi>Atheism.</hi>] The <hi>Atheist</hi> or <hi>Ungodly</hi> in <hi>Opinion.</hi> is he that <hi>thinks</hi> that there is <hi>no God,</hi> or that he is <hi>One</hi> that we need not <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Serve</hi> (and that is but the same, <hi>viz.</hi> to be <hi>no God.</hi>) The <hi>Atheist</hi> or <hi>Ungodly</hi> in <hi>Heart</hi> or <hi>Will,</hi> is he that consenteth not that God shall be <hi>his God,</hi> to be loved, feared and obeyed before all. The <hi>Atheist</hi> in <hi>Life</hi> or outward practice, is he that liveth as without God in the world; that seeketh him not as his chiefest good, and obeyeth him not as his highest absolute Lord; so that indeed <hi>Atheism</hi> is the summe of all iniquity, as <hi>Godliness</hi> is the summe of all Religion and moral good. If you see by the description which I have given you, what it is to be <hi>Godly,</hi> and to <hi>walk with God,</hi> and what it is to be an <hi>Atheist</hi> or <hi>Ungodly,</hi> you may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily see that <hi>Godliness</hi> is more <hi>rare,</hi> and <hi>Atheism</hi> more <hi>common,</hi> than many that themselves are <hi>Atheists</hi> will believe. It is not that which a man <hi>calls</hi> his God, that is taken by him for his God indeed. It is not the <hi>Tongue,</hi> but the <hi>Heart</hi> that is the <hi>man. Pilate called</hi> Christ the <hi>King of the Jews,</hi> when he crucified him. The Jews called <hi>God their Father,</hi> when Christ telleth them, they <hi>were of their father the Devil,</hi> and proveth it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause (what ever they said) <hi>they would do his lusts,</hi> Joh. 8. 44. The same Jews pretended to honour the name of the Messiah, and expect him, while they killed him. The question is not what men <hi>call themselves,</hi> but what <hi>they are:</hi> Not whether <hi>you say</hi> you <hi>take God for your God,</hi> but whether <hi>you do so</hi> indeed: Not whether <hi>you profess</hi> your selves to be <hi>Atheists,</hi> but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you <hi>are</hi> Atheists <hi>indeed</hi> or not. If you are not, look over

what I have here said, and tell your consciences, Do you walk with God? who is it that you submit your selves willingly to be disposed of by? To whom are you most subject? and whose commands have the most effectual authority with you? who is the <hi>Chief Governour</hi> of your hearts and lives? whom is it that you <hi>principally desire to please?</hi> whom do you most <hi>fear?</hi> and whose displeasure do you principally avoid? from whom is it that you expect your <hi>greaetest reward?</hi> and in whom, and with whom do you place and expect your happiness? whose work is it that you do, as the greatest business of your lives? Is it the goodness of God in himself and unto you, that draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up your hearts to him in Love? Is he the ultimate End of the main intentions, design, and industry of your lives? Do you trust upon his Word as your security for your everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hopes and happiness? Do you study and observe him in his works? Do you really live as in his presence? Do you delight in his Word, and meditate on it? Do you love the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Saints? and to be most frequent and familiar with them that are most frequent and familiar with Christ? Do you fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour more the <hi>particular affectionate</hi> discourse about his <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Will</hi> and <hi>Kingdom,</hi> than the frothy talk of empty wits, or the common discourse of carnal worldlings? Do you love to be employed in <hi>thanking</hi> him for his <hi>Mercies,</hi> and in <hi>praising</hi> him, and declaring the glory of his attributes and works? Is your <hi>dependence</hi> on <hi>him</hi> as your great <hi>benefactor,</hi> and do you receive your mercies as <hi>his</hi> gifts? If thus your <hi>principal obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> be <hi>of God,</hi> and your <hi>chief desire after God,</hi> and your <hi>chiefest confidence in God,</hi> and your <hi>chiefest business</hi> in the world be <hi>with God,</hi> and <hi>for God,</hi> and your <hi>chifest joy</hi> be in the <hi>favour of God</hi> (when you can apprehend it) and in the pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity of his <hi>Church,</hi> and your hopes of glory; and your chiefest <hi>grief</hi> and <hi>trouble</hi> be your sinful distance from him, and your backwardness and disability in his love and service, and the fear of his displeasure, and the injuries done to his Gospel and honour in the world; then I must needs say, you are savingly delivered from your Atheism and Ungodliness; you do not only <hi>talk of God,</hi> but <hi>walk with God;</hi> you are then acquainted with that spiritual life and work, which the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual world is unacquainted with, and with those invisible ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting

excellencies, which if worldlings knew, they would change their minds, and choice and pleasures: You are then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with that rational, manly, saintly life, which ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men are strangers to; and you are in the way of that well grounded Hope and Peace to which all the Pleasures and Crowns on earth, if compared, are but cheats and misery. But if you were never yet brought to <hi>walk with God,</hi> do not think that you have a <hi>sound belief in God,</hi> nor that you acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him sincerely, nor that you are saved from <hi>heart atheism:</hi> Nor is it <hi>Piety</hi> in the <hi>Opinion</hi> and the <hi>Tongue,</hi> that will save him that is an <hi>Atheist</hi> or <hi>ungodly</hi> in <hi>heart</hi> and <hi>life.</hi> Divinity is an <hi>affective-practical science: Knowing</hi> is not the <hi>ultimate</hi> or <hi>perfective</hi> act of man: but a <hi>means</hi> to holy <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Joy</hi> and <hi>service.</hi> Nor is it <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>solid knowledge,</hi> if it do not somewhat <hi>affect</hi> the <hi>heart,</hi> and engage and actuate the <hi>life,</hi> according to the nature and use of the thing known. The soundness of <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Belief</hi> is not best discerned in the intellectual acts themselves, but in their <hi>powerful, free</hi> and <hi>pleasant</hi> efficacy, upon our <hi>choice</hi> and <hi>practice.</hi> By these there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you must judge, whether you are <hi>Godly</hi> or <hi>Atheistical.</hi> The question is not what your <hi>Tongues</hi> say of God, nor what complemental ceremonious observances you allow him, but what your <hi>Hearts</hi> and your <hi>endeavours</hi> say of him, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you <hi>glorifie him as God</hi> when you say you <hi>know him:</hi> Otherwise you will find that the <hi>wrath of God is revealed from heaven, against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who held the truth in unrighteousness,</hi>] Rom. 1. 18, 21.</p>
                     <p>And now alas, what matter of lamentation is here before us! To see how seriously men converse with one another; and how God is overlookt or neglected by the most! How men live together, as if there were <hi>more</hi> that is considerable and regardable in these particles of animated dust, then in the Lord Almighty, and in all his graces, service and rewards! To see how God is cast aside, and his interest made to give place to the interest of the flesh, and his services must stay till men have done their service to their lusts, or to worldly men, that can do them hurt, or shew them favour! And his will must not be done, when it crosseth the will of sinful man! How little do all the commands, and promises, and threatnings
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:59347:112"/>
of God signifie with these Atheistical men, in comparison of their lusts, or the laws of men, or any thing that concerneth their temporal prosperity! O how is the world revolted from their Maker! How have they lost the knowledge of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and forgotten their natures, capacities and obligations, and what it is to be indeed <hi>a man!</hi> O hearken sinners, to the call of your Redeemer! Return, O seduced wandering souls, and know at last your resting place! why is not God in all your thoughts? or why is he thought on with so much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misness, unwillingness, and contempt! and with so little pleasure, seriousness, or regard? Do you understand your selves in this? Do you deal worthily with God? Or wisely for your selves? Do you take more pleasure, with the Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, to feed swine, and to feed with swine, then to dwell at home with your heavenly Father? and to walk before him, and serve him in the world? Did you but know how danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a way you have been in, and how unreasonably you have dealt, to forsake God in your hearts, and follow that which cannot profit you, what haste would you make to leave the crowd, and come home to God, and try a more noble and gainful conversation? If Reasons may have room and leave to work upon you, I will set a few before you more distinctly, to call you off from your barren inordinate creature converse, to a believing serious converse with God.</p>

                        </gap>s of <hi>holy walking with him.</hi> How vile a contempt is it of the Almighty, and of our Celestial joyes, for the heart to neglect them, and turn away, and dwell upon vanity and trouble, and let these highest pleasures go! Is not <hi>God and Glory</hi> worthy of thy thoughts, and all thy service?</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>What are those things that take thee up? Are they better then God?</hi> Or <hi>fitter</hi> to supply thy wants? If thou think, and trust in them accordingly, ere long thou shalt know better what they are, and have enough of thy cursed choice and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence. Tell those that stand by thee at the parting hour, whether thou didst choose aright and make a gaining or a
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:59347:113"/>
saving match. O poor sinners! have you not yet warning enough to satisfie you that all things below are Vanity and Vexation, and that all your hope of happiness is above! Will not the testimony of God satisfie you? will not the experience of the world for so many thousand years together satisfie you? will not the ill success of all the damned satisfie you? will no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but your own experience convince you? If so, consider well the experience you have already made, and seasonably retire, and try no further, and trust not so dangerous a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver to the last, least you buy your knowledge at a dearer rate then you will now believe.</p>
                     <p>3. <hi>You have daily more to do with God, than with all the world, whether you will or no:</hi> And therefore seeing you <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not</hi> avoid him if you <hi>would,</hi> prefer that <hi>voluntary obediential converse,</hi> which hath a <hi>reward,</hi> before that <hi>necessitated converse</hi> which hath <hi>none.</hi> You are alwaies in his <hi>hands:</hi> he made you for his service; and he <hi>will</hi> dispose of <hi>you</hi> and <hi>all</hi> that you have according to his will. It shall not go with you as <hi>your selves</hi> would have it, nor as <hi>your friends</hi> would have it, nor as <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>great ones</hi> of the world would have it; (unless as their wills comply with Gods;) but as <hi>God</hi> would have it, who will infallibly accomplish all his will. If a <hi>sparrow fall not to the ground without him, and all the hairs of our heads are numbered,</hi> then certainly he overruleth all your interests and affairs, and they are absolutely at his dispose. To whom then in reason should you so much apply your selves as unto <hi>him?</hi> If <hi>you</hi> will not take notice of <hi>him, he</hi> will take notice of <hi>you:</hi> He will remember you whether you remember him or not: but it may be with so strict and severe a remembrance, as may make you wish he did quite forget you. You are alwaies in his presence; and can you then forget him, and hold no vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary converse with him, when you stand before him? If it be but mean inferiour persons that we dwell with and are still in company with, yet we mind them more, and speak more to them, then we do to <hi>greater</hi> persons that we seldom see. But in God there is both <hi>Greatness</hi> and <hi>Nearness</hi> to invite you. Should not all the worms on earth stand by, while the Glorious God doth call you to him, and offer you the honour and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness of his converse? shall the Lord of Heaven and Earth
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:59347:113"/>
stand by, and be shut out, while you are chatting or trifling with his creatures? Nay, shall he be neglected that is alwaies with you? You cannot remove your selves a moment from his sight; and therefore you should not shut your eyes, and turn away your face, and refuse to observe him who is still ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving you.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, your dependence both for soul and body is all on him: You can have nothing desirable but by his gift. He feeds you, he cloatheth you, he maintaineth you, he gives you life and breath, and all things; and yet can you overlook him or forget him? Do not all his mercies require your acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement? A Dog will follow him that feedeth him: his eye will be upon his Master: And shall we live upon God, and yet forget and disregard him? We are taught a better use of his Mercies by the Holy Prophet, <hi>Psal.</hi> 66. 8, 9. <hi>O bless our God, ye people, and make the voice of his praise to be heard: which holdeth our soul in life, and suffereth not our feet to be moved!</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nay it is not <hi>your selves</hi> alone, but all the world that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on God. It is his power that supporteth them, and his will that disposeth of them, and his bounty that provideth for them: And therefore he must be the observation and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of the world: It is less unreasonable to take no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the <hi>Earth</hi> that beareth us and yieldeth us fruit, and of the <hi>Sun</hi> that yields us heat and light, than to disregard the Lord that is more to us than <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Earth,</hi> and all things. <hi>The eyes of all things wait on him; and he giveth them their meat in season: He openeth his hand and satisfieth the desire of every living thing,</hi> Psal. 145. 15, 16. <hi>The Lord is good to all, and his tender mercies are over all his works: All his works therefore shall praise him, and his Saints shall bless him: They shall speak of the glory of his Kingdom, and talk of his power,</hi> vers. 10, 11.</p>
                     <p>Moreover God is so <hi>abundantly and wonderfully represented</hi> to us in all his <hi>works,</hi> as will leave us under the guilt of most unexcusable contempt, if we overlook him, and live as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him in the world. <hi>The Heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament sheweth his handy work: Day unto day ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth speech; and night unto night sheweth knowledge,</hi> Psa. 19. 1, 2.
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:59347:114"/>
Thus <hi>that which may be known of God is manifest; for the invisible things of him from the Creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal power and Godhead; so that the ungodly are without excuse,</hi> Rom. 1. 19, 20. Cannot <hi>you see</hi> that which <hi>all the world re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealeth?</hi> nor <hi>hear</hi> that which <hi>all the world proclaimeth? O sing ye forth the honour of his name: make his praise glorious! Say to the Lord, How terrible art thou in thy works! through the greatness of thy power shall thine enemies submit themselves unto thee: All the earth shall worship thee, and shall sing unto thee: they shall sing unto thy name: come and see the works of God: he is tertible in his doings towards the children of men,</hi> Psal. 66. 2, 3, 4, 5. Can we <hi>pass him by</hi> that is <hi>everywhere present,</hi> and by every Creature represented to us? Can we <hi>forget</hi> him, when all the world are our remembrancers? Can we stop our <hi>ears</hi> against the voice of Heaven and Earth? Can we be ignorant of him, when the whole Creation is our Teacher? Can we overlook that holy glorious Name, which is written so legibly upon all things that ever our eyes beheld, that nothing but <hi>blindness, sleepiness</hi> or <hi>distraction,</hi> could possibly keep us from discerning it! I have many a time wondred, that (as the eye is dazzled so with the beholding of the greatest Light, that it can scarce perceive the shining of a lesser, so) the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious transcendent Majesty of the Lord, doth not even over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm our understandings, and so transport and take us up, as that we can scarce observe or remember any thing else. For naturally the greatest objects of our sense, are apt to make us at that time insensible of the smaller: And our exceeding <hi>great business,</hi> is apt to make us utterly neglect and forget those that are exceeding <hi>small:</hi> And O what <hi>Nothings</hi> are the <hi>Best</hi> and <hi>Greatest</hi> of the <hi>Creatures,</hi> in comparison of God! And what toyes and trifles are all our other businesses in the world, in comparison of the business which we have with Him! But I have been stopped in these admirations by considering that the wise Creator hath fitted and ordered all his Creatures accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the use which he designeth them to: And therefore as the eye must be receptive only of <hi>so much light</hi> as is propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to its use and pleasure, and must be so <hi>distant</hi> from the Sun, that its Light may rather guide, than blind us, and its Heat
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:59347:114"/>
may rather <hi>quicken,</hi> than consume us; so God hath made our understandings capable of no other knowledge of Him here, than what is suited to the work of holiness: And while we have <hi>Flesh,</hi> and <hi>fleshly works</hi> to do, and lawful necessary busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in the world, in which Gods own commands employ us, our souls in this Lanthorn of the body, must see him through so thick a glass, as shall so far allay our apprehension, as not to distract us, and take us off the works which he enjoyneth us. And God and our souls shall be at such a distance, as that the proportionable Light of his countenance may <hi>conduct us,</hi> and <hi>not overwhelm us;</hi> and his Love may be so revealed, as to <hi>quicken</hi> our desires, and draw us on to a better state, but not so as to make us utterly <hi>impatient</hi> of this world, and utterly <hi>weary</hi> of our lives, or to swallow us up, or possess us of our <hi>most desired happiness,</hi> before we arrive at the <hi>state of happiness.</hi> While the soul is in the body, it maketh so much use of the body (the brain and spirits) in all is operations; that our wise and merciful Creator and Governour, doth respect the body as well as the soul in his ordering, disposing, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting of the objects of those operations: so that when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider that certainly all men would be <hi>distracted,</hi> if their appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions of God were anywhit answerable to the <hi>Greatness of his Majesty</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> (the <hi>Brain</hi> being not able to <hi>bear</hi> such high operations of the soul, nor the <hi>greatness of the passions</hi> which would necessarily follow) it much reconcileth my won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring mind, to the wise and gracious providence of God, even in setting <hi>innocent nature</hi> it self at such a distance from his <hi>Glory</hi> (allowing us the presence of <hi>such Grace,</hi> as is necessary to bring us up <hi>to Glory</hi>) Though it reconcile me not to that doleful distance which is introduced by sin, and which is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered by Satan, the world, and the flesh, and which our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer by his Spirit and Intercession must heal.</p>
                     <p>And it further reconcileth me to this disposure and will of the blessed God, and this necessary natural distance and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of our minds, when I consider, that if God, and Heaven, and Hell, were as near and open to our apprehensions, as the things are which we <hi>see</hi> and <hi>feel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this life</hi> would not be what God intended it to be, a <hi>life of Tryal</hi> and <hi>preparation</hi> to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, a <hi>work,</hi> a <hi>race,</hi> a <hi>pilgrimage,</hi> a <hi>warfare;</hi> what <hi>Tryal</hi>
                        <pb n="194" facs="tcp:59347:115"/>
would there be of any mans <hi>Faith,</hi> or <hi>Love,</hi> or <hi>Obedience,</hi> or <hi>Constancy,</hi> or <hi>Self-denial?</hi> If we <hi>saw God</hi> stand by, or appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended him as if we saw him (in degree) it would be no more praise-worthy or rewardable for a man to abhor all tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to worldliness, ambition, gluttony, drunkenness, lust, cruelty, &amp;c. than it is for a man to be kept from sleeping that is pierced with thorns, or for a man to forbear to drink a cup of melted Gold which he knoweth will burn out his bowels, or to forbear to burn his flesh in the fire. It were no great commendation to his <hi>Chastity,</hi> that would forbear his <hi>filthiness,</hi> if he saw or had the fullest apprehensions of God; when he will forbear it in the presence of a mortal man: It were no great commendations to the intemperate and volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, to have no mind of sensual delights, if they had but such a knowledge of God as were equal to sight. It were no thanks to the persecutor to forbear his cruelty against the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the Lord, if he <hi>saw Christ coming with his glorious Angels, to take vengeance on them that know not God, and obey not the Gospel, and to be admired in his Saints, and glorified in them that now believe,</hi> 2 Thes. 1. 7, 8, 9, 10. I deny not but this <hi>happily necessitated Holiness</hi> is best <hi>in it self,</hi> and therefore will be our state <hi>in Heaven;</hi> but what is there of <hi>Tryal in it?</hi> or how can it be suitable to the state of man, that must have Good and Evil set before him, and Life and Death left to his choice; and that must conquer if he will be crowned, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove his fidelity to his Creator against competitors, and must live a rewardable life before he have the reward?</p>
                     <p>But though in this life we may neither hope for, nor desire, such overwhelming sensible apprehensions of God, as the rest of our faculties cannot answer, nor our bodies bear; yet that our apprehensions of him should be <hi>so base,</hi> and <hi>small,</hi> and <hi>dull,</hi> and <hi>unconstant,</hi> as to by <hi>born down</hi> by the noise of worldly bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness, or by the presence of any creature, or by the tempting baits of sensuality, this is the more odious, by how much God is more Great and Glorious than the creature, and even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the use of the creature it self is but to reveal the Glory of the Lord. To have <hi>such sleight</hi> and <hi>stupid</hi> thoughts of him, as will not carry us on in uprightness of obedience, nor keep us in his fear, nor draw out our hearts in sincere desires to
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:59347:115"/>
please him, and enjoy him, and as will not raise us to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the pleasures, and profits, and honours of this world, this is to be despisers of the Lord, and to live as in a <hi>sleep,</hi> and to be dead to God, and alive only to the world and flesh. It is no unjust dishonour or injury to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e <hi>Creature,</hi> to be accounted as <hi>Nothing</hi> in comparison of God, that it may be able to <hi>do Nothing</hi> against Him and his interest: But to make such a <hi>Nothing</hi> of the <hi>most Glorious God,</hi> by our contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous forgetfulness or neglect, as that our apprehensions of Him cannot prevail against the sordid pleasures of the flesh, and against the richest baits of sin, and against all the wrath or allurements of man, this is but to make a God of dust, and dung, and nothing, and (in heart and practice) to make God worse than dust and dung. And it is a wonder that mans un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding can become so sottish, as thus to wink the Sun it self into a constant darkness, and to take God as <hi>Nothing,</hi> or a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

O sinful man! into how great a depth of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, stupidity and misery art thou faln!</p>
                     <p>But because we may see by the lives of the ungodly, that they little think that they have so much to do with God, though I have spoke of this to the Godly in the other Part of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tese, I shall somewhat more particularly acquaint those that have most need to be informed of it, <hi>what business it is that they have with Ged.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>1. It is not a business that <hi>may be done,</hi> or <hi>left undone,</hi> like your business with <hi>men:</hi> but it is such as <hi>must be done,</hi> or you are <hi>undone</hi> for ever. Nothing is <hi>absolutely Necessary</hi> but this: Nothing in all the world doth so much concern you. You may at far cheaper rates forbear to eat, or drink, or cloath your selves, or live, than forbear the dispatch of this necessary work.</p>
                     <p>2. Your business <hi>with God,</hi> and <hi>for God</hi> in the world, is that which <hi>you have all your powers and endowments for;</hi> it is that which you were born into the world for, and that which you have understanding and free will for, and that which you have your thoughts, and memories, and affections for, and that
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:59347:116"/>
which you have eyes, and ears, and tongues, and all your cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal parts and abilities for: It is that which you have your food and rayment for; and that which you have your time for; and your preservation, protection and provisions: It is that which you have all your teaching for; which Christ himself came for into the world; which the Scriptures are written for; which Ministers are sent for, which all Order and Government in Church and State is principally appointed for: In a word, it is that for which you have your lives, and all things, and without which all were as nothing, and will be to you worse than nothing, if they do not further your work with God: You will wish you had never seen them if they befriend you ot in this.</p>
                     <p>3. Your business <hi>with God,</hi> and <hi>for him,</hi> is such as you must <hi>be continually doing:</hi> as is incumbent on you every hour, for you have every hour given you for this end. You may dispatch this man to day, and another to morrow, and have no more to do with them again of a long time: but you have <hi>alwaies incessantly important</hi> works to do <hi>with God.</hi> For your <hi>common work</hi> should be all <hi>his work;</hi> and all should be done with principal respect to him.</p>
                     <p>But I shall yet more particularly tell the <hi>ungodly what busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness it is that they have with God,</hi> which it seems by their care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less negligent lives they are not aware of.</p>
                     <p>1. You must be either <hi>saved</hi> or <hi>damned by him;</hi> either <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified with Him,</hi> or <hi>punished by Him</hi> to everlasting: And it is <hi>Now</hi> that the matter must be determined, which of the two conditions you must be in: You must <hi>Now</hi> obtain your <hi>title</hi> to Heaven, if ever you will come thither: You must <hi>Now</hi> procure your deliverance from Hell fire, if ever you will escape it. <hi>Now</hi> it is that all that must be done, upon which the scales must turn for your salvation or damnation: And you know this work is principally to be done between you and God, who alone can save you or destroy you; and yet do you <hi>forget him,</hi> and live as if you had no business with him, when you have your <hi>salvation</hi> to <hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>2. <hi>You have a strict and righteous Judgement to undergo,</hi> in
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:59347:116"/>
order to this salvation or damnation. You must stand before the Holy Majesty, and be judged by the Governour of the World: you must be there accused, and found guilty or not guilty; and judged as fulfillers or as breakers of the holy Covenant of Grace: you must be set on the right hand or on the left: you must answer for all the time that you here spent, and for all the means and mercies which you here received, and for that you have done, whether it were good or evil: And it is <hi>now</hi> in this life that all your preparation must be made, and all that must be done, upon which your justification or condemnation will then depend. Anh it is between God and you that all this business must be done: And yet can you live as negligently towards him, as if you had no business with him?</p>
                     <p>3. You have a <hi>Death to dye,</hi> a <hi>change</hi> to make which must be made but once; which will be the entrance upon endless joy or pain: And do you think this needeth not your most timely and diligent preparation? You must struggle with pains, and faint with weakness, and feel death taking down your earthen tabernacle: you must then have a life that is ending to review, and all that you have done said open to your more impartial judgement; You must then see Time as at an end, and the last sand running, and your candle ready to go out, and leave the snuff; You must then look back upon all that you have had from the world, as ending; and upon all that you have done as that which cannot be undone again, that you may do it better; and you must have a more seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous look into Eternity, when you are stepping thither, then you can now conceive of: And doth all this need no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration? It is <hi>with God</hi> that all that business must be <hi>Now</hi> transacted, that must make your death to be comfortable, or safe. If <hi>Now</hi> you will only converse with <hi>men,</hi> and know no business that you have with <hi>God,</hi> you shall find at last to your exceeding terrour, that you are in his hands, and passing to his bar, and that it is God that then you have to do with, when your business with all the world is at an end: <hi>He</hi> will <hi>then</hi> have something to do with <hi>you,</hi> if you will <hi>now</hi> find nothing to do with <hi>him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>4. In order to all this, you <hi>have now your Peace to be made
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:59347:117"/>
with God,</hi> and the <hi>pardon</hi> of all your sins to be obtained. For woe to you if then you are found under the guilt of any sin. Look back upon your lives, and remember how you have lived in the world, and what you have been doing: how you have spent your time, in youth and in your riper age; and how many sinful thoughts, and words, and deeds you have been guilty of; how oft you have sinfully pleased your appetites, and gratified your flesh, and yeilded to temptations, and abused mercy, and lost your time: how oft you have neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed your duty, and betrayed your souls: how long you have lived in forgetfulness of God and your salvation; minding only the things of the flesh and of the world: how oft you have sinned <hi>ignorantly</hi> and against <hi>knowledge,</hi> through <hi>care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesness</hi> and through <hi>rashness,</hi> through <hi>negligence</hi> and through <hi>presumption,</hi> in <hi>passion,</hi> and upon <hi>deliberation;</hi> against <hi>convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, purposes</hi> and <hi>promises:</hi> how oft you have sinned against the precepts of piety to God, and of justice and charity to men. Think how your sins are multiplied and aggravated, more in number then the hours of your lives: Aggravated by a world of mercies: by the clearest teachings, and the lowd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est calls, and sharpest reproofs, and seasonable warnings, and by the long and urgent importunities of grace. Think of all these, and then consider whether you have nothing now to do with God, whether it be not a business to be followed with all possible speed and diligence to procure the pardon of all these sins: you have no such businesses as these, to transact with men: you may have business with them which your estates depend upon, or which touch your credit, commodity or lives; but you have no business with men (unless in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination to God) which your salvation doth depend upon: your eternal happiness is not in their hands: They may kill your bodies, (if God permit them) but not your souls. You need not sollicite them to pardon your sins against God: It is a small matter how you are judged of by man: you have one that judgeth you, even the Lord, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 3, 4. No man can forgive sin, but God only. O then how early, how earnestly should you cry to him for mercy! Pardon <hi>must be obtained now or never:</hi> There is <hi>no Justification</hi> for that man at the day of <hi>Judgement,</hi> that is not forgiven and <hi>iustified now.
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:59347:117"/>
Blessed then is the man whose iniquity is forgiven, whose sin is covered, and to whom it is not imputed by the Lord,</hi> Rom. 4. 7, 8. And wo to that man that ever he was born, that is then found without the pardon of his sins! Think of this as the case de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves, and then think if you can, that your daily business with God is small.</p>
                     <p>5. Moreover, you have <hi>Peace of Conscience</hi> to obtain; and that dependeth upon your <hi>Peace with God.</hi> Conscience will be your accuser, condemner and tormenter, if you make it not your friend, by making God your friend. Consider what Conscience hath to say against you, and how certainly it will speak home, when you would be loth to hear it: and bethink you how to answer all its accusations, and what will be necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to make it a messenger of Peace; and then think your bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness with God to be but small, if you are able. It is no easie matter to get <hi>assurance</hi> that God is reconciled to you, and that he hath forgiven all your sins.</p>
                     <p>6. In order to all this, you must be <hi>united to Jesus Christ,</hi> and be <hi>made his members,</hi> that you may have <hi>part in him,</hi> and that he may wash you by his blood, and that he may answer for you to his Father! woe to you if <hi>he</hi> be not <hi>your righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> and if you have not <hi>him</hi> to plead your cause, and take upon him your final justification! None else can save you from the wrath of God: And he is the Saviour only of <hi>his body,</hi> Eph. 5. 23. He hath <hi>dyed for</hi> you <hi>without</hi> your <hi>own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,</hi> and he hath made an <hi>universal conditional grant of pardon and salvation,</hi> before you <hi>consented</hi> to it: But he will not be <hi>united</hi> to you, nor <hi>actually forgive</hi> and <hi>justifie</hi> and <hi>save</hi> you without <hi>your own consent:</hi> And therefore that the Father may draw you to the Son, and may <hi>give you Christ and Life in him</hi> (1 Joh. 5. 9, 10, 11.) when all your hope dependeth on it, you may see that you have more to do with God, then your senseless hearts have hitherto understood.</p>
                     <p>7. And that you may have a saving interest in Jesus Christ, you must <hi>have sound Repentance</hi> for all your former life of wickedness, and a <hi>lively effectual faith in Christ:</hi> Neither <hi>sin</hi> nor <hi>Christ</hi> must be made light of. <hi>Repentance</hi> must tell you to the very heart, that you have done foolishly in sining, and that <hi>it is an evil and a bitter thing that you forsook the Lord,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:59347:118"/>
and that his fear was not in you: and thus your wickedness shall correct you and reprove you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> Jer. 2. 19. And <hi>Faith</hi> must tell you that <hi>Christ</hi> is more necessary to you then <hi>food</hi> or <hi>life,</hi> and that there is no other name given under heaven by which you can be saved, <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 12. And it is not so easie, nor so common a thing to <hi>Repent</hi> and <hi>Believe</hi> as ignorant presumptuous sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners do imagine. It is a greater matter to have a truly hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled contrite heart, and to loath your selves for all your sins, and to loath those sins, and resolvedly give up your selves to Christ and to his Spirit for a holy life, then heartlesly and hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritically to say, <hi>I am sorry,</hi> or <hi>I Repent,</hi> without any true <hi>Contrition</hi> or <hi>Renovation.</hi> And it is a greater matter to betake your selves to Jesus Christ as your only hope to save you both from sin and from damnation, then barely through cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom and the benefit of education to say, <hi>I do believe in Christ.</hi> I tell you it is so great a work to bring you to sound <hi>Repentance and Faith,</hi> that it must be done by the power of God himself, <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 31. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 25. They are the <hi>Gift of God,</hi> Eph. 2. 8. you must have <hi>his spirit</hi> to <hi>illuminate you,</hi> Eph. 1. 18. and shew you the odiousness of fin, the intolerableness of the wrath of God, the necessity and sufficiency, the power and willingness of Christ; and to overcome all your prejudice, and save you from your false opinions and deceits; and to repulse the temptations of Satan, the world and the flesh which will all rise up against you. All this must be done to bring you home to Jesus Christ, or else you will have no part in him, his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness and grace: And can you think that you have not most important business with God, who must do all this upon you, or else you are undone for ever!</p>
                     <p>8. Moreover you must have <hi>all the corruptions of your na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures healed,</hi> and your <hi>sins subdued,</hi> and your <hi>hearts made new by sanctifying grace,</hi> and the <hi>Image of God</hi> implanted in you, and your lives made holy and sincerely conformable to the will of God. All this <hi>must</hi> be done, or you cannot be accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God, nor ever will be saved: Though your carnal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest rise against it; though your old corrupted natures be against it; though your custome, and pleasure, and worldly gain and honour be against it; though all your carnal friends and superiors be against it; though the devil will do all that
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:59347:118"/>
he can against it; yet all this <hi>must be done,</hi> or you are lost for ever: And all this must be done by the Spirit of God; for it is his work to make you New and Holy: And can you think then that the business is not great which you have with God? when you have tryed how hard every part of this work is, to be begun and carryed on, you will finde you have more to do with God, than with all the world.</p>
                     <p>9. Moreover in order to this, it is necessary that <hi>you read, and hear, and understand the Gospel,</hi> which must be the means of bringing you to God by Christ: This must be the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, by which he will bring you to <hi>Repent and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,</hi> and by which he will <hi>renew your Natures,</hi> and <hi>imprint his Image on you,</hi> and bring you to <hi>Love</hi> him, and <hi>obey his will.</hi> The <hi>Word of God</hi> must be your <hi>Counsellor,</hi> and your <hi>delight,</hi> and you must <hi>set your heart to it,</hi> and <hi>meditate in it day and night. Knowledge</hi> must be the means to reclaim your perverse misguided Wills, and to reform your careless crooked Lives, and to bring you out of the Kingdom of darkness into the State of Light and Life. And <hi>such Knowledge</hi> cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected without a diligent attending unto Christ the Teacher of your souls, and a due consideration of the truth. By that time you have learnt what is needful to be learnt for a true Conversion, a sound Repentance, a saving Faith, and a holy Life, you will finde that you have far greater business with God than with all the world.</p>
                     <p>10. Moreover for the <hi>attaining of all this Mercy, you have many a prayer to put up to God:</hi> You must <hi>daily pray</hi> for the <hi>forgiveness</hi> of your sins, and deliverance from <hi>temptations,</hi> and even for <hi>your daily bread,</hi> or necessary provisions for the work which you have to do: You must daily pray for all the supplies of Grace which you want, and for the gradual mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of the flesh, and for help in all the duties which you must perform; and for strength against all the spiritual ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies which will assault you; and preservation from the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest evils which attend you: And these prayers must be put up with unwearied <hi>constancy, fervency</hi> and <hi>Faith.</hi> Keep up this course of <hi>fervent prayer,</hi> and beg for Christ, and Grace, and Pardon, and Salvation in any measure as they deserve, and according to thy <hi>own necessity,</hi> and then tell mee whether thy
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:59347:119"/>
business with God be small, and to be put off as lightly as it is by the ungodly.</p>
                     <p>11. Moreover, you are <hi>made for the Glory of your Creator, and must apply your selves wholly to glorifie him in the world:</hi> You must make his service the <hi>trade</hi> and <hi>business</hi> of your lives, and not put him off with something on the by: You are good for nothing else but to serve him; as a knife is made to cut, and as your cloaths are made to cover you, and your meat to seed you, and your horse to labour for you; so you are <hi>made</hi> and <hi>redeemed,</hi> and maintained for this, to <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Please</hi> your great Creator: And can you think that it is but little business that you have with him, when he is the <hi>End</hi> and <hi>Master</hi> of your lives, and all you <hi>are</hi> or <hi>have</hi> is for him?</p>
                     <p>12. And for the due performance of his service, <hi>you have all his Talents to employ.</hi> To this end it is that he hath entrusted you with <hi>reason,</hi> and <hi>health,</hi> and <hi>strength,</hi> with <hi>time,</hi> and <hi>parts,</hi> and <hi>interest,</hi> and <hi>wealth,</hi> and <hi>all his mercies,</hi> and <hi>all his ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> and <hi>means of Grace;</hi> and to this end must you use them, or you lose them: And you must give him an account of all at last, whether you have <hi>improved</hi> them all to your <hi>Masters use.</hi> And can you look within you, without you, about you, and see how much you are trusted with, and must be accountable to him for, and yet not see how great your business is with God?</p>
                     <p>13. Moreover, you have all the <hi>graces</hi> which you <hi>shall</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to <hi>exercise;</hi> and every grace doth carry you to God, and is exercised <hi>upon him,</hi> or <hi>for him:</hi> It is God that you must <hi>study,</hi> and <hi>know,</hi> and <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>desire,</hi> and <hi>trust,</hi> and <hi>hope</hi> in, and <hi>obey:</hi> It is God that you must <hi>seek</hi> after, and <hi>delight</hi> in so far as you enjoy him: It is <hi>his</hi> absence or displeasure that must be your <hi>fear</hi> and <hi>sorrow:</hi> Therefore the soul is said to be <hi>san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified</hi> when it is renewed, because it is both <hi>disposed</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted</hi> unto <hi>God.</hi> And therefore Grace is called <hi>Holiness,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it all <hi>disposeth,</hi> and carryeth the soul to God, and useth it <hi>upon</hi> and <hi>for</hi> him. And can you think your business with God is small, when you must <hi>live</hi> upon him, and all the powers of your soul must be addicted to him, and be in serious motion towards him? and when he must be much more to you than the <hi>Air</hi> which you breath in, or the <hi>Earth</hi> you live upon, or
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:59347:119"/>
than the <hi>Sun</hi> that gives you light and heat; yea than the <hi>soul</hi> is to your <hi>bodies?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>14. Lastly, you have abundance of <hi>temptations</hi> and <hi>impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> to <hi>watch</hi> and <hi>strive</hi> against, which would hinder you in the doing of all this work, and a <hi>corrupt</hi> and treacherous <hi>heart</hi> to watch and keep in order, which will be looking back, and shrinking from the service. Lay all this together, and then consider whether you have not more and greater business with God, than with all the creatures in the world.</p>
                     <p>And if this be so (as undeniably it is so) is there any cloak for that mans sin, who is all day taken up with creatures, and thinks of God as seldome and as carelesly as if he had <hi>no busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> with him? And yet, alas, if you take a survey of high and low, of Court, and City, and Country, you shall find that this is the case of no small number, yea of many that observe it not to be their case; it is the case of the prophane that pray in jeast, and swear, and curse, and rail in earnest. It is the case of the malignant enemies of holiness, that hate them at the heart that are most acquainted with this converse with God, and count it but hypocrisie, pride or fancy, and would not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them to live upon the Earth, who are most sincerely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant in Heaven. It is the case of Pharise<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

It is the case of all ambitious men, and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous worldlings, who make more ado to climb up a little higher than their brethren, and to hold the reins, and have their wills, and be admired and adored in the world, or to get a large estate for themselves and their posterity, than to please their Maker, or to save their souls: It is the case of every sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual Epicure, whose belly is his God, and serveth his fancy, lust and appetite before the Lord. It is the case of every un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanctified man, that seeketh first the prosperity of his flesh, before the Kingdom and Righteousness of God, and is most careful and laborious to lay up a treasure on Earth, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth more (with the greater estimation, resolution and delight) for the meat that perisheth, than for that which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth to everlasting life. All these (who are too great a part
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:59347:120"/>
of the world, and too great a part of professed Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans) are taken up with <hi>creature converse;</hi> and yet think to scape the deludge of Gods displeasure, because the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nochs</hi> and <hi>Noahs</hi> are so few who <hi>walk with God;</hi> and they think God will not destroy so many: And thus they think to be saved by their <hi>multitude,</hi> and to hide themselves in the <hi>croud</hi> from God: They will go the wide and common path, and be of the mind that most are of: They will not be convinced till <hi>most men</hi> are convinced; that is, till their wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome come too late, and cost them dearer than its worth. When <hi>all men</hi> are convinced that God should have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before the world, and served before their fleshly lusts (as they will <hi>certainly</hi> and sadly be) then <hi>they</hi> will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced with the rest. When <hi>all men</hi> understand that Life was given them to have done the work which Eternal Life de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth on, then <hi>they</hi> will understand it with the rest. When <hi>all men</hi> shall <hi>discern between the righteous and the wicked; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween those that serve God, and that serve him not,</hi> then <hi>they</hi> will discern it with the rest: They will know what their business was in the world, and how much they had to do with God, when <hi>all men</hi> know it. But O how much better for them had it been to have known it in time while knowledge might have done them better service, than to make them feel the greatness of their sin and folly, and the hopes which once they had of happiness, and to help the sting of desperation continually to prick them at the heart. They would be of so <hi>little a Flock</hi> as that to which it was the <hi>good pleasure</hi> of God to <hi>give the Kingdom,</hi> Luk. 12. 32. If you demand a <hi>Reason</hi> of all this, their <hi>Reason</hi> was in their <hi>throats</hi> and <hi>bellies:</hi> They had <hi>fleshly appetites</hi> and <hi>lusts,</hi> and thereby could <hi>rellish fleshly pleasures;</hi> but spiritual <hi>life</hi> and <hi>appetite</hi> they had none, and therefore <hi>rellished not</hi> spiritual things: Had <hi>Christ,</hi> and <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> and <hi>Heaven</hi> been as <hi>suitable</hi> to their appetites, as the sweetness of their meat, and drink, and lusts, and as suitable to their <hi>fantasies</hi> as their worldly dignities and greatness were, they would then have made a better choice. They would have walked with God, if drunkenness and gluttony, and pride and wantonness, and covetousness and idleness, had been the way in which they might have walked with him. If <hi>these</hi> had been
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:59347:120"/>
                        <hi>Godliness,</hi> how <hi>Godly</hi> would they have been? How certainly would they have come to Heaven, if this had been the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> way? To be idle, and proud, and fleshly, and worldly, is it that they <hi>love;</hi> and to be humble, and holy, and heavenly, and morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, is that which they <hi>hate,</hi> and cannot away with: And their <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Hatred</hi> proceed from their corrupted natures; and these are instead of <hi>Reason</hi> to them. Their strong appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions of a <hi>present suitableness</hi> in <hi>fleshly pleasures</hi> to their <hi>appetites,</hi> and of a <hi>present unsuitableness</hi> of a <hi>holy life,</hi> do keep out all effectual apprehensions of the excellencies of God, and of spiritual heavenly delights, which cross them in the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures which they most desire.</p>
                     <p>But yet (their appetites corrupting their understandings as well as their wills) they will not be mad without <hi>some reason,</hi> nor reject their Maker and their happiness without <hi>some rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> nor neglect that holy work which they were made for without some reason: Let us hear then what it is.</p>

If the <hi>damned</hi> would be so presumptuous as to argue, that because God is able yet to <hi>sanctifie</hi> and <hi>save</hi> them, therefore he <hi>must do</hi> it of <hi>necessity of nature,</hi> it would not be long before they should thus dispute themselves out of their <hi>tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> God will not ask leave of sinners to <hi>be God:</hi> Their denying him to be <hi>Good</hi> (that is, to be God) because he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth not with their <hi>conceits</hi> and <hi>wills,</hi> doth but prove them to be <hi>fools</hi> and <hi>bad</hi> themselves.</p>
                     <p>Indeed some Sciolists, pretending to learning, while they are ignorant of most obvious principles of natural knowledge, have taught poor sinners to cheat their souls with such dreams as these.

<pb n="207" facs="tcp:59347:122"/>
ready to measure all <hi>Good</hi> or <hi>Evil</hi> by their <hi>own interest;</hi> when yet common reason would have told them, if they had not perverted it by <hi>pride</hi> and <hi>partial studies,</hi> that <hi>short of God,</hi> even among the <hi>Creatures,</hi> there are <hi>many things</hi> to be <hi>preferred before themselves</hi> and their <hi>own felicity:</hi> He is irrationally enslaved by <hi>self love,</hi> that cannot see that the <hi>happiness of the world,</hi> or of his <hi>Country,</hi> or of <hi>multitudes</hi> is more to be desired then <hi>his happiness alone.</hi> And that he ought rather to choose to be <hi>annihilated</hi> or to be <hi>miserable</hi> (if it were made a matter of his <hi>deliberation</hi> and <hi>choice</hi>) then to have the <hi>Sun</hi> taken out of the <hi>firmament,</hi> or the <hi>world,</hi> or his <hi>Country</hi> to be <hi>annihilated</hi> or <hi>miserable.</hi> And God is infinitely above the Creature.</p>
                     <p>Obj. <hi>But they say,</hi> He needeth nothing to make him happy, having no defect of happiness.</p>

                        <hi>Answ.</hi> And what of that? Must it needs therefore follow that he <hi>made not all things for himself,</hi> but for the <hi>creature finally?</hi> He is perfectly happy in himself, and his <hi>will</hi> is <hi>himself:</hi> This <hi>will</hi> was fulfilled when the world was not made, (for it was his will that it should not be made till it was made) and it is fulfilled when it is made, and fulfilled by all that comes to pass: And as the <hi>absolute simple Goodness and Perfection of Gods essence</hi> is the <hi>Greatest Good,</hi> the eternal immutable Good; so the <hi>fulfilling</hi> of <hi>his will</hi> is the <hi>ultimate end</hi> of all <hi>obedience:</hi> He hath expressed himself to <hi>take pleasure</hi> in his works, and in the holiness, obedience and happiness of his chosen: And though <hi>Pleasure</hi> be not the same thing in God as it is in man (no more then <hi>will</hi> or <hi>understanding</hi> is) yet it is <hi>not nothing</hi> which God expresseth by such terms, but something which we have no fitter expression for: This <hi>Pleasing of the will of God</hi> being the <hi>end of all,</hi> even of our <hi>felicity,</hi> is <hi>better</hi> then our <hi>felicity</hi> it self.</p>
                     <p>They that will maintain that God, who is <hi>naturally</hi> and <hi>necessarily Good,</hi> hath no other <hi>Goodness</hi> but his <hi>Benignity</hi> or aptness to do good to his creatures, must needs also maintain that (<hi>God being for the Creature,</hi> and not the <hi>Creature for God</hi>) the Creature is <hi>better</hi> then <hi>God,</hi> as being the <hi>ultimate end</hi> of God himself, and the highest use of all his Goodness being but for the felicity of the Creature: As also that God doth do all the Good that he is able: (For natural necessary agents work
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:59347:123"/>
                        <hi>ad ultimum posse.</hi>) And that all men shall be saved, and all Devils, and every worm and toad be equal to the highest An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, or else that God is <hi>not able to do it.</hi> And that he <hi>did thus make happy all his Creatures from eternity</hi> (for natural necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry agents work <hi>alwayes</hi> if they be not forcibly hindered;) and that there <hi>never was</hi> such a thing as <hi>pain</hi> or <hi>misery,</hi> in <hi>man</hi> or <hi>brute,</hi> or else that God was not able to prevent it. But abundance of such odious consequences must needs follow from the denying of the <hi>Highest Good,</hi> which is <hi>God himself,</hi> and confesting none but his <hi>efficient Goodness.</hi> But some will be offended with me for being so serious in confuting such an irrational Atheistical conceit, who know not <hi>how far</hi> it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaileth with <hi>an Atheistical generation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Be it known to you careless sinners, that though the <hi>Sun</hi> will <hi>shine</hi> on you whether you think on it or not, or love it, or thank it or not; and the <hi>fire</hi> will <hi>warm</hi> you whether you think on it and love it or not; yet <hi>God</hi> will not <hi>justifie</hi> or <hi>save</hi> you whether you <hi>love</hi> him or <hi>think</hi> on him or not: God doth not operate <hi>brutishly</hi> in your salvation; but <hi>Governeth</hi> you <hi>wisely,</hi> as <hi>rational Creatures</hi> are to be governed; and therefore will give you Happiness as a <hi>reward;</hi> and therefore will not deal alike with those that love him and that love him not, that seek him and that seek him not, with the labourers and the loiterers, the faithful and the slothful servant. Would you have us believe that <hi>you</hi> know better then <hi>God himself</hi> what pleaseth him, or on what terms he will give his benefits, and save mens souls? or do you know his nature better then <hi>he</hi> knoweth it, that you dare presume to say, because he need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not our love or duty, therefore they are not <hi>pleasing</hi> to him! Then what hath God to do in governing the world, if he be pleased and displeased with nothing that men do, or with good and evil actions equally? Though you cannot <hi>hurt him,</hi> you shall find that he will hurt you if you disobey him: And though you cannot make <hi>him happy</hi> by <hi>your holiness,</hi> you shall find that he will not make <hi>you happy without it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And if he did work as necessarily as the Sun doth shine, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your similitude; yet, 1. Even the shining of the Sun doth not illuminate the blind, nor doth it make the seeds of thorns and nettles to bring forth vines or roses, nor the
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:59347:123"/>
gendering of frogs to bring forth men; but it actuateth all things according to the several natures of their powers. And therefore how can you expect that an ignorant unbelieving and unholy soul, should enjoy felicity in God, when in that state they are uncapable of it? 2. And if the <hi>Sun</hi> do necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily illuminate any one, he must necessarily be illuminated; and if it necessarily warm or quicken any thing, it must be necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily warmed and quickened: else you would assert contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions. So if God did necessarily save you and make you happy, you would necessarily be saved and made happy. And that containeth <hi>essentially</hi> your <hi>Holiness,</hi> your <hi>Loving, desiring</hi> and <hi>seeking</hi> after God; To be <hi>saved</hi> or <hi>happy</hi> without <hi>enjoying God by Love,</hi> or to <hi>Love him</hi> and not <hi>Desire him, seek him</hi> or <hi>obey him,</hi> are as great contradictions as to be <hi>illuminated</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>light,</hi> or <hi>quickened</hi> without <hi>life.</hi> What way soever it be that God conveyeth his <hi>sanctifying spirit,</hi> I am sure that <hi>if any man have not the spirit of Christ, the same is none of his,</hi> Rom. 8. 9. and that without <hi>Holiness none shall see God,</hi> Heb. 12. 14. and that if you will have the Kingdom of God, you <hi>must seek it first,</hi> preferring it before all earthly things, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 33. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 27. <hi>Col.</hi> 4. 1, 2, 3. And then if all the question that remaineth undecided be, whether God do <hi>you wrong</hi> or not in <hi>damning you,</hi> or whether <hi>God</hi> be <hi>Good</hi> because he will not save you when he can, I shall leave you to him to receive satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, who will easily silence and consound your impudence, and justifie his works and laws. Prepare your accusations against him, if you will needs insist upon them, and try whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he or you shall prevail: but remember that thou art a worm and he is God, and that he will be the only judge when all is done; and ignorance and impiety that prate against him to their own confusion, in the day of his patience, shall not then usurp the throne.</p>

                     <p>And though God be infinitely above us, yet he conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendeth to communicate to us according to our capacities: As the Sun is far from us, and yet doth not disdain to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten, and warm, and quicken a worm or fly here below.

                        <hi>Quest.</hi> 1. Doth not the continued <hi>being</hi> and <hi>well-being</hi> of the Creatures, tell us that <hi>there is a God</hi> on whom (for <hi>being</hi> and <hi>well-being</hi>) they depend, and from whom they <hi>are</hi> and <hi>have</hi> whatsoever they <hi>are</hi> and whatsoever they <hi>have?</hi> And therefore that passively all the Creatures have more respect to him by far then to one another?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Quest.</hi> 2. Seeing God communicateth <hi>to every Creature</hi> according to their <hi>several capacities;</hi> is it not meet then that he deal with <hi>man as man,</hi> even as a <hi>Creature Rational, capable to know and love and obey</hi> his Great Creator, and to <hi>be happy</hi> in the knowledge, love and fruition of him? That man <hi>hath</hi> such <hi>natural faculties,</hi> and <hi>capacities,</hi> is not to be denyed by a man that knoweth what it is to <hi>be a man:</hi> And that God hath not given him these <hi>in vain,</hi> will be easily believed by any that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed believe that he <hi>is God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Quest.</hi> 3. Is there <hi>any thing else</hi> that is <hi>finally worthy</hi> of the highest actions of our souls? or that is fully <hi>adequate</hi> to them, and fit to be our happiness? If not, then we are left either to certain infelicity, contrary to the tendency of our natures, or else we must seek our felicity in God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Quest.</hi> 4. Is there any thing more certain then that by the title of Creation, our <hi>Maker</hi> hath a <hi>full and absolute right</hi> to all that he hath made; and consequently to <hi>all our love</hi> and <hi>obedience,</hi> our <hi>time</hi> and <hi>powers?</hi> For whom should they all be used but for him from whom we have them?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Quest.</hi> 5. Can any thing be more sure, then that God is
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:59347:124"/>
the <hi>Righteous Governour</hi> of the world? and that he Governeth <hi>man</hi> as a <hi>rational creature,</hi> by <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Judgement?</hi> And can we live under his absolute Soveraignty, and under his many <hi>righteous Laws,</hi> and under his <hi>Promises</hi> of salvation to the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified, and under his <hi>threatnings</hi> of damnation to the unjusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and yet not have more to do with God than with all the world? If indeed you think that God doth not Love and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the holy and obedient, and punish the ungodly and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient, then either you take him <hi>not</hi> to be the <hi>Governour</hi> of the world, or (which is worse) you take him to be an <hi>unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous</hi> Governour: And then you must by the same reason say, that <hi>Magistrates</hi> and <hi>Parents</hi> should do so too, and love and reward the obedient and disobedient alike: But if any mans disobedience were exercised to <hi>your hurt,</hi> by slandering, or beating, or robbing you, I dare say you would not then commend so <hi>indifferent</hi> and <hi>unjust</hi> a Governour.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Quest.</hi> 6. If it be not needless for man to <hi>Labour</hi> for <hi>food</hi> and <hi>rayment,</hi> and necessary provision for his body, how can it be needless for him to <hi>labour</hi> for the happiness of his soul? If God will not give us our <hi>daily bread</hi> while we never <hi>think</hi> of it, or <hi>seek</hi> it, why should we expect that he will give us <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> though we never <hi>think</hi> on it, <hi>value</hi> it, or <hi>seek</hi> it?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Quest.</hi> 7. Is it not a contradiction to be <hi>happy in the fruition of God,</hi> and yet <hi>not to mind him, desire him,</hi> or <hi>seek him?</hi> How is it that the <hi>Soul</hi> can reach its <hi>Object,</hi> but by <hi>estimation, desire</hi> and <hi>seeking</hi> after it: And how should it <hi>enjoy</hi> it but by <hi>Loving it,</hi> and taking <hi>pleasure</hi> in it?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Quest.</hi> 8. While you seem but to wrangle against the <hi>Duty</hi> of believers, do you not plead against the <hi>comfort</hi> and <hi>happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of believers? For surely the <hi>employment</hi> of the soul <hi>on God</hi> (and <hi>for him</hi>) is the <hi>health</hi> and <hi>pleasure</hi> of the soul; And to call away the soul from such employment, is to <hi>impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> it in the dungeon of this world, and to forbid us to smell to the sweetest flowers, and confine us to a sink or dunghill<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to forbid us to tast of the food of Angels, or of men, and to offer us Vineger and Gall, or turn us over to feed with Swine. He that pleadeth that there is no such thing as real <hi>Holiness &amp; Communion with God,</hi> doth plead in effect that there is no true felicity or delight for any of the Sons of men: And
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:59347:125"/>
how welcome should ungodly Atheists be unto mankind, that would for ever exclude them all from happiuess, and make them believe they are all made to be remedilesly miserable?</p>
                     <p>And here take notice of the madness of the unthankful world, that hateth and persecuteth the Preachers of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, that bring them the glad tidings of pardon, and hope, and life eternal, of solid happiness, and durable delight; and yet they are not offended at these Atheists and ungodly Cavillers, that would take them off from all that is truly <hi>good</hi> and <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant,</hi> and make them believe that nature hath made them ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of no higher things than beasts, and hath enthralled them in <hi>remediless infelicity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Quest.</hi> 9. Do you not see by experience that there <hi>are a people</hi> in the world whose <hi>hearts are upon God,</hi> and the life to come, and that make it their chiefest care and business to seek him and to serve him? How then can you say that there <hi>is no such thing,</hi> or that we are not capable of it, when it is the case of so many before your eyes? If you say that it is but their <hi>fancy</hi> or <hi>self-deceit:</hi> I answer, that <hi>really</hi> their <hi>hearts are set upon God,</hi> and the everlasting world, and that it is their chiefest care and business to attain it; this is a thing that <hi>they feel,</hi> and <hi>you may see</hi> in the bent and labour of their lives; and therefore you cannot call that a fancy, of which you have so full experience: But whether the <hi>motives</hi> that have invited them, and engaged them to such a choice and course, be <hi>fancies</hi> and <hi>deceits</hi> or not, let God be Judge, and let the awakened consciences of worldlings themselves be Judge, when they have seen the end, and tryed whether it be Earth or Heaven that is the shadow, and whether it be God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or their unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving hearts that was deceived.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Quest.</hi> 10. Have you <hi>any hopes</hi> of living with God for ever, or not? If you <hi>have not,</hi> no wonder if you live as beasts, when you have no higher expectations than beasts: When <hi>we</hi> are <hi>so blind</hi> as to give up all our <hi>hopes,</hi> we will also give up all our <hi>care</hi> and <hi>holy diligence,</hi> and think we have nothing to do with Heaven. But if you <hi>have</hi> any such hopes, can you think that any thing is fitter for the chiefest of your <hi>thoughts</hi> and <hi>car<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>,</hi> than the God and Kingdom, which you hope for ever to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy? Or is there any thing that can be more <hi>suitable,</hi> or should
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:59347:125"/>
be more <hi>delightful</hi> to your thoughts, than to employ them about your highest hopes, upon your endless happiness and joy? and should not that be now the most noble and pleasant employment for your minds, which is nearest to that which you hope to be exercised in for ever? Undoubtedly he that hath <hi>true and serious thoughts of Heaven,</hi> will highliest value that life on <hi>Earth</hi> which is likest to the life in Heaven: And he that hateth, or is most averse to that which is nearest to the work of Heaven, doth boast in vain of his hopes of Heaven.</p>
                     <p>By this time you may see (if you love not to be blind) that mans <hi>chiefest business</hi> in the world is <hi>with his God,</hi> and that our <hi>thoughts</hi> and all our powers are made to be employed upon him, or for him; and that this is no such needless work as Atheists make themselves believe.</p>
                     <p>Remember that it is the description of the desperately wicked, <hi>Psal.</hi> 10. 4. that <hi>God is not in all his thoughts.</hi> And if yet you understand it not, I will a little further shew you the evil of such Atheistical unhallowed thoughts.</p>
                     <p>1. There is nothing but <hi>darkness</hi> in <hi>all thy Thoughts,</hi> if <hi>God</hi> be not in them. Thou <hi>knowest nothing,</hi> if thou knowest not <hi>him;</hi> and thou <hi>usest not</hi> thy knowledge, if thou use it not on <hi>him.</hi> To know the creature as without God, is to <hi>know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:</hi> No more than to know all the <hi>Letters</hi> in the Book, and not to know their <hi>signification</hi> or <hi>sense.</hi> All things in the world are but <hi>insignificant ciphers,</hi> and of no other <hi>sense</hi> or <hi>use,</hi> if you separate them from <hi>God,</hi> who is their <hi>sense</hi> and <hi>end.</hi> If you leave out <hi>God</hi> in all your studies, you do but dream and dote, and not understand what you <hi>seem</hi> to understand. Though you were taken for the learnedst men in the world, and were able to discourse of all the Sciences, and your thoughts had no lower employment daily than the most sublime spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations which the nature of all the creatures doth afford, it is all but folly and impertinent dotage, if it reach not unto God.</p>
                     <p>2. Yea, your thoughts are <hi>erroneous</hi> and <hi>false,</hi> which is more than <hi>barely ignorant,</hi> if God be not in them. You have <hi>false thoughts</hi> of the <hi>world,</hi> of your <hi>houses</hi> and <hi>lands,</hi> and <hi>friends</hi> and <hi>pleasures,</hi> and whatsoever, is the daily employment of your minds. You take them to be <hi>something,</hi> when they are
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:59347:126"/>
                        <hi>nothing;</hi> you are covetous of the <hi>empty purse,</hi> and know not that you cast away the <hi>treasure:</hi> You are thirsty after the <hi>empty cup,</hi> when you wilfully cast away the <hi>drink.</hi> You hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grily seek to feed upon a <hi>painted feast:</hi> You <hi>murder</hi> the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by separating it from <hi>God</hi> who is <hi>its life,</hi> and then you are <hi>enamoured</hi> on the <hi>carkass,</hi> and spend your daies and thoughts in its cold embracements. Your thoughts are but vagabonds, stragling abroad the world, and following impertinencies, if God be not in them. You are like men that walk up and down in their sleep, or like those that have lost themselves in the dark, who weary themselves in going they know not whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and have <hi>no end,</hi> nor <hi>certain way.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. If God be not in all your thoughts, they are <hi>all in vain.</hi> They are like the drone that gathereth no honey: They fly abroad and return home empty: They bring home no matter of honour to God, of profit or comfort to your selves: They are employed to no more purpose than in your dreams: On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they are more capable of sin: Like the distracted thoughts of one that doteth in a feaver, they are all but <hi>non-sense,</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you employ them on, while you leave out God who is the <hi>sense</hi> of all.</p>
                     <p>4. If God be not in all your thoughts, they are nothing but <hi>confusion:</hi> There can be no just <hi>Unity</hi> in them, because they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake him who is the only <hi>Center,</hi> and are scatterad abroad upon incoherent creatures. There can be no true <hi>Unity</hi> but in God: The further we go from him, the further we run in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to divisions and confusions. There can be no just <hi>Method</hi> in them, because he is left out that is the <hi>Beginning</hi> and the <hi>End.</hi> They are not like a well ordered Army, where every one is moved by the will of <hi>one Commander,</hi> and all know their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours and their ranks, and unanimously agree to do their work: But like a swarm of Flyes, that buzze about they know not <hi>whither,</hi> nor <hi>why,</hi> nor <hi>for what.</hi> There is no true <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> in your thoughts, if God be not in them; they are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterless and vagrants, and have no true <hi>order,</hi> if they be not ordered <hi>by him</hi> and <hi>to him;</hi> if he be not their <hi>First</hi> and <hi>Last.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>5. If God be not in all your <hi>thoughts,</hi> there is no <hi>Life</hi> in them: They are but like the motion of a bubble, or a feather
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:59347:126"/>
in the Air: They are <hi>impotont</hi> as to the resisting of any evil, and as to the doing of any saving-good. They have no <hi>strength</hi> in them, because they are laid out upon <hi>objects</hi> that have no strength: They have no quickning, renewing, reforming, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging, resolving, confirming <hi>power</hi> in them, because there is no such power in the things on which they are employed: whereas the thoughts of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>everlasting life,</hi> can do won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders upon the soul: They can raise up men above this world, and teach them to despise the worldlings Idol, and look upon all the pleasures of the flesh as upon a Swines delight in wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing in the mire. They can renew the soul, and cast out the most powerful beloved sin, and bring all our powers into the obedience of God, and that with pleasure and delight: They can employ us with the Angels, in a heavenly conversation, and shew us the Glory of the world above, and advance us above the life of the greatest Princes upon earth: But the <hi>thoughts</hi> of <hi>earthly fleshly</hi> things have <hi>power</hi> indeed to <hi>delude</hi> men, and <hi>mislead</hi> them, and hurry them about in a vertigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous motion; but no power to support us, or subdue concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence, or heal our folly, or save us from temptations, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce us from our errors, or help us to be useful ie the world, or to attain felicity at last. There is no <hi>Life,</hi> nor <hi>Power,</hi> nor <hi>Efficacy</hi> in our <hi>thoughts,</hi> if <hi>God</hi> be not in them.</p>
                     <p>6. There is no <hi>stability</hi> or <hi>fixedness</hi> in your <hi>thoughts,</hi> if <hi>God</hi> be not in them. They are like a boat upon the Ocean, tost up and down with winds and waves: The <hi>mutable uncertain crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> can yield no <hi>rest</hi> or <hi>settlement</hi> to your minds. You are <hi>troubled about many things;</hi> and the more you think on them, and have to do with them, the more are you troubled: But you forget the <hi>One thing Necessary,</hi> and fly from the <hi>Eternal Rock,</hi> on which you must build if ever you will be established. While the Creature is in your thought instead of God, you will be one day deluded with its unwholesome pleasure, and the next day feel it gripe you at the heart: One day it will seem your happiness, and the next you will wish you had never known it: That which seemeth the <hi>only comfort</hi> of your lives this year, may the next year make you <hi>aweary</hi> of your lives. One day you are impatiently desiring and seeking it, as if you could not live without it: and the next day, or ere long you
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:59347:127"/>
are impatiently desiring to be rid of it: You are now taking in your pleasant mors<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ls, and drinking down your delicious draughts, and jovially sporting it with your inconsiderate companions: But how quickly will you be repenting of all this, and complaining of your folly, and vexing your selves, that you took not warning, and made not a wiser choice in time? The creature was never made to be your <hi>end,</hi> or <hi>rest,</hi> or <hi>happiness:</hi> and therefore you are but like a man in a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness or a maze, that may go and go but knoweth not whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and findeth no end, till you come home to God, who only is your proper end, and make him the <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>life</hi> and <hi>pleasure</hi> of your thoughts.</p>
                     <p>7. As there is no present <hi>fixedness</hi> in your thoughts, so the <hi>business</hi> and <hi>pleasure</hi> of them will be of very <hi>short continuance,</hi> if God be not the chief in all. And who would choose to imploy his thoughts on such things as he is sure they must <hi>soon forget,</hi> and never more have any business with to all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity! You shall think of those houses, and lands, and friends, and pleasures but a little while, unless it be with repenting tormenting thoughts, in the place of misery: you will have no delight to think of any thing, which is now most precious to your flesh, when once the flesh it self decayes, and is no more capable of delight, <hi>Psal.</hi> 146. 4. <hi>His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Call in your thoughts then from these transitory things, that have no consistency or continuance, and turn them unto him with whom they may find everlasting employment and delight: Remember not the enticing baits of sensuality and pride, but [<hi>Remember now thy Creatour in the dayes of thy youth, while the evil dayes come not, nor the years draw nigh when thou shalt say, I have no pleasure in them.</hi>]</p>
                     <p>8. Thy thoughts are but <hi>sordid, dishonourable</hi> and <hi>low,</hi> if <hi>God</hi> be not the <hi>chiefest</hi> in them. They reach no higher then the habitation of beasts; nor do they attain to any sweeter employment then to meditate on the felicity of a brute: Thou choosest with the fly to feed on dung and filthy ulcers, and as magots to live on stinking carrion, when thou mightst have free access to God himself, and mightst be entertained in the Court of heaven, and wellcomed thither by the holy Angels:
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:59347:127"/>
Thou wallowest in the mire with the swine, or diggest thy self a house in the earth, as worms and moles do, when thy thoughts might be soaring up to God, and might be taken up with high and holy and everlasting things. What if your thoughts were employed for preferment, wealth and honour in the world? Alas what silly things are these, in comparison of what your souls are capable of? You will say so your selves when you see how they will end, and fail your expectations. Imprison not your minds in this infernal cell, when the superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or regions are open to their access: confine them not to this narrow vessel of the body, whose tossings and dangers on these boistrous seas will make them restless, and disquiet them with tumultuous passions, when they may safely land in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise and there converse with Christ. God made you <hi>men,</hi> and if you reject not his grace, will make you <hi>Saints:</hi> Make not your selves like <hi>beasts</hi> or <hi>vermine.</hi> God gave you <hi>souls</hi> that can step in a moment from earth to heaven, and there foretast the endless joyes: Do not you stick then fast in clay, and setter them with worldly cares, or intoxicate them with flesh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleasures, nor employ them in the worse-then-childish toyes of ambitious, sensual, worldly men: Your thoughts have Manna, Angels food, provided them by God: If you will loath this and refuse it, and choose with the serpent to feed on the dust, or upon the filth of sin, God shall be judge, and your consciences one day shall be more faithful witnesses, whether you have dealt like wise men or like fools; like friends or enemies to your selves; and whether you have not chosen baseness, and denyed your selves the advancement which was offered you.</p>
                     <p>9. If <hi>God</hi> be not the <hi>chiefest</hi> in your <hi>thoughts,</hi> they are no better then <hi>dishonest</hi> and <hi>unjust.</hi> You are guilty of denying him his <hi>own.</hi> He made not your mindes for lust and pleasure, but for <hi>himself:</hi> you expect that your cattle, your goods, your servants, be employed for your selves, because they are your own. But God may call your <hi>minds</hi> his <hi>own</hi> by a much fuller title: for you hold all but derivatively and dependently from him: what will you call it but injustice and dishonesty, if your wife, or children, or servants, or goods, be more at the use and service of others, then of you? If any can shew a
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:59347:128"/>
better title to your Thoughts then God doth, let him have them; but if not, deny him not his own. O straggle not so much from home; for you will be nowhere else so well as there: Desire not to follow strangers, you know not whither, nor for what: you have a Master of your own, that will be better to you then all the strangers in the world. Bow not down to creatures, that are but Images of the true and solid good: Commit not Idolatry or Adultery with them in your thoughts: Remember still that God stands by: Bethink you how he will take it at your hands: and how it will be judged of at last, when he pleads his right, his kindness, and sollicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of you; and you have so little to say for any pretence of right or merit in the creature. Why are not men ashamed of the greatest <hi>dishonesty</hi> against <hi>God,</hi> when all that have any humanity left them, do take <hi>adultery, theft</hi> and other <hi>dishonesty</hi> against <hi>creatures</hi> for a shame? The time will come when <hi>God</hi> and <hi>his interest</hi> shall be better understood, that <hi>this dishonesty</hi> against <hi>Him,</hi> will be the matter of the most confounding shame, that ever did or could befall men. Prevent this by the juster exercise of your thoughts, and keeping them pure and chast to God.</p>
                     <p>10. If <hi>God</hi> be not in your <hi>thoughts</hi> (and the <hi>chiefest</hi> in them) there will be no matter in them of <hi>solid comfort</hi> or <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. Trouble</hi> and <hi>deceit</hi> will be all their work: when they have fled about the earth, and taken a tast of every flower, they will come loaden home with nothing better then <hi>Vanity</hi> and <hi>Vexation.</hi> Such thoughts may excite the <hi>laughter of a fool,</hi> and cause that <hi>mirth</hi> that is called <hi>madness,</hi> Eccles. 7. 4, 6. and 2. 2. But they will never conduce to <hi>setled Peace,</hi> and <hi>durable content:</hi> And therefore they are alwaies <hi>repented</hi> of themselves, and are troublesome to our <hi>review,</hi> as being the <hi>shame</hi> of the sinner, which he would fain be cleared of or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own. Though you may <hi>approach</hi> the creature with passionate fondness, and the most delightful promises and hopes, be sure of it, you will <hi>come off</hi> at last with grief and disappointment, if not with the loathing of that which you chose for your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. Your thoughts are in a wilderness among thorns and bryars, when God is not in them as their guide and end: They are lost and torn among the creatures; but rest and
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:59347:128"/>
satisfaction they will find none. It may be at the present it is pleasanter to you to think of recreation, or business, or worldly wealth then to think of God: But the pleasure of these thoughts is as delusory, and short-lived, as are the things themselves on which you think. <hi>How long</hi> will you think with pleasure on such <hi>fading transitory</hi> things? And the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure cannot be great at the <hi>present,</hi> which reacheth but the flesh and fantasie, and which the possessed <hi>knoweth</hi> will be but short. Nay you will shortly find by sad experience, that of all the creatures under heaven, there will <hi>none be so bitter</hi> to your thoughts, as <hi>those</hi> which you now find greatest carnal sweetness in: O how bitter will the thought of idolized ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and abused wealth and greatness be to a dying or a damned <hi>Dives!</hi> The thoughts of <hi>that Alehouse</hi> or <hi>Playhouse</hi> where thou hadst thy greatest pleasure, will trouble thee more then the thoughts of all the houses in the town besides: The thoughts of that <hi>one woman</hi> with whom thou didst commit thy pleasant sin, will wound and vex thee more then the thoughts of all the women in the town besides. The thoughts of <hi>that beloved sport</hi> which thou couldst not be weaned from, will be more troublesome to thee then the thoughts of a thousand other things in which thou hadst no inordinate <hi>delight.</hi> For the <hi>end</hi> of <hi>sinful mirth</hi> is <hi>sorrow:</hi> when <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> had tryed to please himself to the full, in mirth, in build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, vineyards, woods, waters, in servants, and possessions, silver, and gold, and cattel, and singers, and instruments of musick of all sorts, in greatness, and all that the eye or appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite or heart desired, he findeth when he awaked from this pleasant dream, that he had all this while been taken up with <hi>Vanity</hi> and <hi>Vexation,</hi> in so much that he saith on the review [<hi>Therefore I hated life, because the work that is wrought under the sun, is grievous to me, for all is vanity and vexation of spirit: Yea I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun,</hi>] Eccles. 2. 1, 2, 3, &amp;c. 17. 18.

                     <p>BY this time I hope you may see reason to call your selves to a strict account, what converse you have been taken up with in the world, and upon what you have exercised your thoughts: surely you must needs be conscious, that the thoughts which have been denyed God, have brought you home but little satisfaction, and have not answered the ends of your creation, redemption or preservation! and that they are now much fitter matter for your penitential tears, then for your comfort, in the review! I do not think you <hi>dare own</hi> and <hi>stand to,</hi> those thoughts which have been spent for <hi>fleshly pleasures,</hi> or in <hi>unnecessary worldly cares,</hi> or that were wasted in impertinent vagaries upon <hi>any thing,</hi> or <hi>nothing,</hi> when you should have been seeking God! I do not think you have now any great pleasure, in the review of those thoughts, which once were taken up with <hi>pleasure,</hi> when your most pleasant thoughts should have been of God. Dare you approve of your rejecting your Creatour and the great concernments of your soul out of your <hi>thoughts,</hi> and wasting them upon things unprofitable and vain? Did not God, and Heaven deserve more of your serious thoughts then any thing else that ever they were employed on? Have you laid them out on any thing that more concerned you? or on any thing more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, more honourable, more durable, or that could claim precedency upon any just account? Did you not shut <hi>heaven it self</hi> out of your thoughts, when you shut out <hi>God?</hi> And is it not just that <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Heaven</hi> should shut out <hi>you?</hi> If <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>

be not the principal matter of your <hi>thoughts,</hi> its plain that you do not principally <hi>love it:</hi> And if so, judge you whether those that <hi>Love it not</hi> are fit to be made possessors of it.</p>
                     <p>O poor distracted senseless world! Is not God Great enough to command and take up your chiefest cogitations? Is not Heaven enough to find them work, and afford them sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction and delight? And yet is the dung and dotage of the world enough? Is your honour and wealth, and fleshly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights aed sports enough? God will shortly make you know, whether this were wise and equal dealing! Is God so low, so little, so undeserving, to be so oft and easily forgotten, and so hardly and so sleightly remembred? I tell you, <hi>ere long</hi> he will <hi>make you</hi> think of him to your sorrow, whether you will or no, if grace do not now set open your hearts, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure him better entertainment.</p>
                     <p>But perhaps you will think that you <hi>walk with God,</hi> because you <hi>think of him sometimes ineffectually,</hi> and as on the by. But is he <hi>esteemed as your God,</hi> if he have not the <hi>Command,</hi> and if he have not the precedency of his creatures? Can you dream that indeed you <hi>walk with God,</hi> when your hearts were never grieved for offending him, nor never much solicitous how to be reconciled to him; nor much inquisitive whether your state or way be pleasing or displeasing to him? when all the business of an unspeakable importance, which you have to do with God, before you pass to judgement, is <hi>forgotten</hi> and <hi>undone,</hi> as if you knew not of any such work that you had to do! when you make no serious preparation for death, when you call not upon God in secret, or in your families, unless with a little heartless lip labour; and when you love not the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuality of his worship, but only delude your souls with the mockage of hypocritical outside complement. Do you <hi>walk with God</hi> while you are plotting for preferment, and gaping after worldly greatness, while you are gratifying all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires of your flesh, and making provision for the future satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of its lusts? <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 13. Are you walking with God when you are hating him in his Holiness, his Justice, his Word and Waies, and hating all that seriously love and seek him? when you are doing your worst to dispatch the work of your damnation, and put your salvation past all hope, and

draw as many to Hell with you as you can: If this be a <hi>walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with God,</hi> you may take further comfort that you shall also <hi>dwell with God</hi> according to the sense of such a walk: you shall <hi>dwell with him</hi> as a <hi>devouring fire,</hi> and <hi>as just,</hi> whom you thus walked with in the <hi>contempt</hi> o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>I tell you, if you <hi>walkt with God</hi> indeed, his authority would rule you, his Greatness would much take up your minds, and leave less room for little things; You would trust his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, and fear his threatnings, and be awed by his presence, and the Idols of your hearts would fall before him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He would over power your lusts, and call you off from your ambitious and covetous designs, and obscure all the creatures Glory.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> But (perhaps some will say) [<hi>This seemeth to be the work of Preachers, and not of every Christian to be alwaies meditating of God: Poor people must think of other matters: They have their business to do, and their families to provide for: And ignorant people are weak-headed, and are not able either to manage or endure a contemplative life: so much thinking of God will make them melancholy and mad, as experience tells us it hath done by many: and therefore this is no exercise for them.</hi>]</p>
                     <p>To this I answer, 1. <hi>Every Christian</hi> hath a <hi>God</hi> to serve<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and a <hi>Soul</hi> to save, and a <hi>Christ</hi> to believe in and obey, and an <hi>endless happiness</hi> to secure and enjoy, as well as <hi>Preachers: Pastors</hi> must study to <hi>instruct their flock,</hi> and to <hi>save themselves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> and those that hear them: The <hi>people</hi> must study to <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand</hi> and <hi>receive</hi> the mercy offered them, and to make their own calling and election sure. It is not said of <hi>Pastors only,</hi> but of <hi>every blessed man,</hi> that <hi>His delight is in the Law of the Lord, and therein doth he meditate day and night,</hi> Psal. 1. 2. 2. And the <hi>due meditation</hi> of the soul upon <hi>God,</hi> is so far from taking you off from your necessary business in the world, that it is the only way to your <hi>orderly</hi> and <hi>successful</hi> management of it. 3. And it is not a <hi>distracting thoughtfulness</hi> that I perswade you to, or which is included in a Christians <hi>walk with God:</hi> but it is a <hi>directing, quickening, exalting, comforting</hi> course of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation:
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:59347:130"/>
Many a hundred have grown <hi>melancholy</hi> and <hi>mad</hi> with <hi>careful discontentful</hi> thoughts of the <hi>world;</hi> it doth not follow therefore that <hi>no man</hi> must <hi>think of the world at all,</hi> for fear of being <hi>mad</hi> or <hi>melancholy;</hi> but only that they should think of it more <hi>regularly,</hi> and correct the <hi>errour</hi> of their <hi>thoughts</hi> and <hi>passions:</hi> so is it about <hi>God</hi> and <hi>heavenly things:</hi> Our <hi>thoughts</hi> are to be <hi>well ordered,</hi> and the <hi>errour</hi> of them cured, and not the <hi>use</hi> of them <hi>forborn. Atheism</hi> and <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety,</hi> and <hi>forgetting God,</hi> are unhappy means to prevent <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy:</hi> There are <hi>wiser means</hi> for avoiding <hi>madness,</hi> than by renouncing all our <hi>Reason,</hi> and living by <hi>sense</hi> like the beasts that perish, and forgetting that we have an everlasting life to live.</p>
                     <p>But yet because I am sensible that some do here mistake on the other hand, and I would not lead you into any extream, I shall fully remove the scruple contained in this Objection, by shewing you in those following <hi>Propositions,</hi> in <hi>what sense,</hi> and <hi>how far</hi> your <hi>thoughts</hi> must be taken up with God (supposing what was said in the beginning, where I described to you the duty of <hi>Walking with God.</hi>)</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Prop.</hi> 1. When we tell you that your <hi>Thoughts</hi> must be on God, it is not a course of <hi>idle musing,</hi> or <hi>meer thinking,</hi> that we call you to, but it is a <hi>necessary practical thinking</hi> of that which you have to do, and of him that you must love, obey and enjoy. You will not forget your <hi>Parents,</hi> or <hi>Husband,</hi> or <hi>Wife,</hi> or <hi>Friend;</hi> and yet you will not <hi>spend your time</hi> in <hi>sitting still</hi> and <hi>thinking of them,</hi> with a <hi>musing unprofitable thoughtfulness;</hi> But you will have <hi>such thoughts</hi> of them, and <hi>so many</hi> as are necessary to the <hi>Ends,</hi> even to the <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Service</hi> which you owe them, and to the <hi>Delight</hi> that your hearts should have in the fruition of them. You cannot <hi>love,</hi> or <hi>obey,</hi> or take <hi>pleasure</hi> in those that you will not <hi>think</hi> of: You will follow your trades, or your Masters service but unhappily, if you will not <hi>think</hi> on them. <hi>Thinking</hi> is not the work that we must take up with: It is but a <hi>subservient instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental</hi> duty, to promote some <hi>greater higher</hi> duty: <hi>Therefore</hi> we must <hi>Think</hi> of God, that we may <hi>Love him,</hi> and <hi>do</hi> his <hi>Service,</hi> and <hi>Trust</hi> him, and <hi>Fear</hi> him, and <hi>Hope</hi> in him, and make him our <hi>Delight.</hi> And <hi>all this</hi> is it that we call you to,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:59347:131"/>
when we are perswading you to <hi>Think on God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. An <hi>hypocrite,</hi> or a <hi>wicked enemy</hi> of God, may <hi>Think</hi> of him <hi>speculatively,</hi> and perhaps be more <hi>frequent</hi> in such <hi>thoughts</hi> than many practical believers. A <hi>Learned man</hi> may study <hi>about God,</hi> as he doth about other matters, and names, and notions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and propositions and decisions concerning God, may be a principal part of his Learning: A <hi>Preacher</hi> may stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy about God and the matters of God, as a <hi>Physician</hi> or a <hi>Lawyer</hi> do about the matters of their own profession, either for the <hi>pleasure</hi> which knowledge as knowledge brings to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, or for the <hi>credit</hi> of being esteemed <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>learned,</hi> or because their <hi>gain</hi> and <hi>maintenance</hi> comes in this way. They that fill many Volumes with Controversies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning God, and fill the Church with contentions and troubles by them, and their own hearts with malice and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitableness against those that are not of their opinions, have many and many a <hi>thought of God,</hi> which yet will do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the <hi>saving</hi> of their <hi>souls,</hi> no more than they do to the <hi>sanctifying of them.</hi> And such learned men may think more <hi>Orthodoxly</hi> and <hi>Methodically</hi> concerning God, than many an honest serious Christian, who yet thinks of him more <hi>effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> and <hi>savingly:</hi> Even as they can <hi>discourse</hi> more <hi>orderly</hi> and <hi>copiously</hi> of God, when yet they have no <hi>saving knowledge</hi> of him.</p>
                     <p>3. <hi>All men</hi> must not bestow <hi>so much time</hi> in Meditation as <hi>some</hi> must do: It is the <hi>Calling</hi> of <hi>Ministers</hi> to study so as to furnish thrir minds with all those truths concerning God, which are needful to the Edification of the Church; and so to <hi>meditate on these things</hi> as <hi>to give themselves wholly to them,</hi> 1 Tim. 4. 15, 16. It is both the work of their <hi>common</hi> and their <hi>special</hi> Calling: The study necessary to <hi>Christians as such,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth as well to others as to them: But other men have another <hi>special</hi> or <hi>particular</hi> Calling, which also they must think of, so far as the nature and ends of their daily labours do require. It is a hurtful errour to imagine that men must either lay by their Callings to meditate on God, or that they must do them negligently, or to be taken up in the midst of their em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments with <hi>such studies of God</hi> as <hi>Ministers</hi> are that are <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated</hi> to <hi>that work.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <pb n="225" facs="tcp:59347:131"/>4. No man is bound to be <hi>continually</hi> taken up with <hi>actual, distinct</hi> cogitations about God: For in duty we have many many other things to think on, which must have their time: And as we have Callings to follow, and must eat our bread in the sweat of our brows, so we must manage them with pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: <hi>A good man will guide his affairs with discretion,</hi> Psal. 112. 5. It is both necessary as <hi>duty,</hi> and necessary as a <hi>means</hi> to the preservation of our very faculties, that both <hi>body</hi> and <hi>mind</hi> have their <hi>times</hi> of employment about our lawful business in the world: The <hi>understandings</hi> of many cannot bear it, to be <hi>alwaies</hi> employed on the <hi>greatest</hi> and <hi>most serious</hi> things: Like <hi>Lute<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> strings</hi> they will <hi>break,</hi> if they be raised <hi>too high,</hi> and be not let down and relaxed when the lesson is plaid. To think of <hi>nothing else but God,</hi> is to <hi>break the Law of God,</hi> and to confound the mind, and to disable it to <hi>think aright of God,</hi> or <hi>any thing.</hi> As he that bid us <hi>pray continually,</hi> did not mean that we should do <hi>nothing else,</hi> or that <hi>actual prayer</hi> should have no interruptions, but that <hi>habitual desires</hi> should on <hi>all meet occasion</hi> be actuated and exprest; so he that would be <hi>chief in all our thoughts,</hi> did never mean that we should have <hi>no thoughts</hi> of any thing else, or that our serious meditation on him should be <hi>continual</hi> without interruption: but that the <hi>final intending</hi> of God, and our <hi>dependence on him,</hi> should be <hi>so constant</hi> as to be the <hi>spring</hi> or <hi>mover</hi> of the rest of the thoughts and actions of our lives.</p>
                     <p>5. An <hi>habitual intending God</hi> as <hi>our End,</hi> and <hi>depending on</hi> his <hi>support,</hi> and <hi>subjection</hi> to <hi>his Government,</hi> will carry on the soul in a sincere and constant course of Godliness, though the <hi>actual most observed thoughts</hi> of the soul, be <hi>fewer</hi> in number about God, than about the <hi>means</hi> that lead unto him, and the <hi>occurrences</hi> in our way: The soul of man is very active and comprehensive, and can think of several things at once: and when it is <hi>once clear and resolved</hi> in any case, it can <hi>act</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>that knowledge</hi> and <hi>resolution,</hi> without any <hi>present sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible cogitation;</hi> nay while its <hi>actual most observed</hi> thoughts, are upon something else. A Musician that hath an <hi>habitual skill,</hi> can keep time and tune while he is <hi>thinking</hi> of some other matter: A <hi>Weaver</hi> can cast his shuttle right, and work truly, while he is thinking or talking of other things. A man can <hi>eat</hi>
                        <pb n="226" facs="tcp:59347:132"/>
and <hi>drink</hi> with discretion while he talks of other things. Some men can dictate to two or three Scribes at once, upon divers subjects: A Traveller can keep on his way, though he seldome think distinctly of his Journies end, but be thinking or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing most of the way, upon other matters: For before he undertook his Journey he <hi>thought</hi> both of the <hi>end</hi> and <hi>way,</hi> and resolved then which way to go, and that he would go through all both fair and foul, and not turn back, till he saw the place: And this habitual understanding and resolution, may be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly and unobservedly active, so as to keep a man from er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and from turning back, though at the same time the Travellers most sensible thoughts and his discourse may be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on something else. When a man is once resolved of his End, and hath laid his design, he is past deliberating of that, and therefore hath less use of his cogitations thereabout: but is readier to lay them out upon the means, which may be still uncertain, or may require his frequent deliberation. We have usually more thoughts and speeches by the way, about our company, or our Horses, or Innes, or other accommodations, or the fairness or foulness of the way, and other such occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, than we have about the <hi>place</hi> that we are going to: And yet this <hi>secret intention of our end,</hi> will bring us thither. So when a soul hath cast up his accounts, and hath renounced a worldly and sensual felicity, and hath fixed his hopes and reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions upon Heaven, and is resolved to cast himself upon Christ, and take God for his only portion, this <hi>secret habitual resolution</hi> will do much to keep him constant in the way, though his <hi>thoughts</hi> and <hi>talk</hi> be frequently on other things: Yea when we are <hi>thinking of the creature,</hi> and <hi>feel no actual thoughts of God,</hi> it is yet <hi>God</hi> more than the <hi>creature</hi> that we <hi>think of:</hi> For we did <hi>beforehand</hi> look on the <hi>creature</hi> as <hi>Gods work,</hi> representing him unto the world, and as his <hi>talents</hi> which we must employ for him, and as every creature is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to him: And <hi>this estimation</hi> of the <hi>creature</hi> is still <hi>habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually</hi> (and in some <hi>secret less-perceived acts</hi>)) most <hi>prevalent</hi> in the soul. Though I am not alwaies <hi>sensibly</hi> thinking of the <hi>King,</hi> when I <hi>use</hi> his <hi>Coin,</hi> or <hi>obey</hi> his <hi>Law, &amp;c.</hi> yet it is only <hi>as his Coin</hi> still that I use it, and <hi>as his Laws</hi> that I obey them. <hi>Weak Habits</hi> cannot do their work without great carefulness
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:59347:132"/>
of <hi>thoughts:</hi> but <hi>perfect habits</hi> will <hi>act</hi> a man with <hi>little thoughtfulness,</hi> as coming near the <hi>natural way</hi> of operation. And indeed the imperfection of our <hi>Habitual Godliness</hi> doth make our <hi>serious thoughts</hi> and <hi>vigilancy</hi> and <hi>industry</hi> to be the more necessary to us.</p>
                     <p>6. There are <hi>some thoughts</hi> of <hi>God</hi> that are necessary to the very <hi>Being</hi> of a <hi>Holy state;</hi> as that God be so much in our thoughts, as to be <hi>preferred before all things else,</hi> and <hi>principally beloved and obeyed;</hi> and to be the <hi>end</hi> of our lives, and the <hi>byas</hi> of our <hi>wills:</hi> And there are <hi>some thoughts</hi> of God that are necessary only to <hi>acting</hi> and <hi>increase</hi> of grace.</p>
                     <p>7. So great is the <hi>weakness</hi> of our <hi>Habits,</hi> so <hi>many</hi> and <hi>great</hi> are the <hi>temptations</hi> to be overcome, so <hi>many difficulties</hi> are in our way, and the <hi>occasions</hi> so <hi>various</hi> for the exercise of each grace, that it behoveth a Christian to exercise <hi>as much thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness</hi> about his <hi>end</hi> and <hi>work,</hi> as hath <hi>any tendency</hi> to <hi>promote his work</hi> and to <hi>attain</hi> his <hi>end:</hi> But such a <hi>thoughtfulness</hi> as <hi>hindereth</hi> us in our <hi>work,</hi> by <hi>stopping,</hi> or <hi>distracting,</hi> or <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting</hi> us, is no way pleasing unto God. So excellent is <hi>our end,</hi> that we can never <hi>encourage</hi> and <hi>delight</hi> the mind too much in the <hi>forethoughts</hi> of it. So <hi>sluggish</hi> are our <hi>hearts,</hi> and so loose and unconstant are our apprehensions and resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that we have need to be most frequently quickening them, and lifting at them, and renewing our desires, and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing the contrary desires, by the <hi>serious thoughts</hi> of God and Immortality. Our <hi>Thoughts</hi> are the bellows that must kindle the flames of Love, desire, <hi>hope</hi> and zeal: Our thoughts are the spur that must put on a sluggish tired heart. And so far as they conduce to any such works and ends as these, they are desireable and good. But what Master loveth to see his servant <hi>sit down</hi> and <hi>Think</hi> when he should be <hi>at work?</hi> Or to <hi>use his Thoughts only</hi> to <hi>grieve</hi> and <hi>vex</hi> himself for his faults, but not to <hi>mend</hi> them? to sit down lamenting that he is so bad and unprofitable a servant, when he should be up and doing his Masters business as well as he is able. Such <hi>Thoughts</hi> are <hi>sins</hi> as <hi>hinder</hi> us from duty, or <hi>discourage</hi> or <hi>unfit</hi> us for it, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they may go under a better name.</p>
                     <p>8. The <hi>Godly themselves</hi> are very <hi>much wanting</hi> in the <hi>holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of their <hi>thoughts,</hi> and the <hi>liveliness</hi> of their <hi>affections.
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:59347:133"/>
Sense</hi> leadeth away the thoughts too easily after these present sensible things; while <hi>faith</hi> being <hi>infirm,</hi> the <hi>Thoughts</hi> of God and heaven are much disadvantaged by their invisibility. Many a gracious soul cryeth out, <hi>O that I could think as easily and as affectionately and as unweariedly about the Lord and the life to come, as I can do about my friends, my health, my habitation, my business, and other concernments of this life!</hi> But alas such thoughts of God and Heaven have far <hi>more enemies</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance,</hi> then the thoughts of earthly matters have.</p>
                     <p>9. It is not <hi>distracting, vexatious thoughts of God,</hi> that the holy Scriptures call us to; but it is to such thoughts as tend to the <hi>healing</hi> and <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>felicity</hi> of the soul; and therefore it is not to a <hi>melancholy,</hi> but a <hi>joyful life.</hi> If God be better then the world, it must needs be better to think of him. If he be more <hi>beloved</hi> then any friend, the thoughts of him should be <hi>sweeter</hi> to us. If he be the <hi>everlasting hope and happiness</hi> of the soul, it should be a <hi>foretast of happiness</hi> to find him nearest to our hearts. The nature and use of holy thoughts, and of all Religion, is but to <hi>exalt</hi> and <hi>sanctifie</hi> and <hi>delight</hi> the soul, and bring it up to <hi>everlasting Rest:</hi> And is this the way to <hi>melancholy</hi> or <hi>madness?</hi> Or is it not liker to make men <hi>melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly,</hi> to think of nothing but a <hi>vain, deceitful</hi> and <hi>vexatious</hi> world, that hath much to disquiet us, but nothing to satisfie us, and can give the soul no hopes of any durable delight?</p>
                     <p>10. Yet as God is not <hi>equally related</hi> unto <hi>all,</hi> so is he not the <hi>same</hi> to <hi>all mens thoughts.</hi> If a <hi>wicked enemy of God</hi> and godliness, be forced and frightened into some thoughts of God, you cannot expect that they should be as <hi>sweet</hi> and <hi>comfortable</hi> thoughts, as those of his most obedient children are. While a man is under the <hi>guilt</hi> and <hi>power</hi> of his <hi>reigning sin,</hi> and under the <hi>wrath</hi> and <hi>curse</hi> of God, unpardoned, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justified, a child of the devil, it is not <hi>this mans duty</hi> to think of God, as if he were fully <hi>reconciled</hi> to him, and took pleasure in him as in his own. Nor is it any wonder if <hi>such a man</hi> think of God with <hi>fear,</hi> and think of his sin with grief and shame. Nor is it any wonder if the justified themselves do think of God with <hi>fear and grief,</hi> when they have provoked him by some sinful and unkind behaviour, or are cast into <hi>doubts</hi> of their sincerity and interest in Christ, and when he hides his face, or
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:59347:133"/>
assaulteth them with his terrors. To doubt whether a man shall live for ever in Heaven or Hell, may rationally trouble the thoughts of the wisest man in the world; and it were but sottishness not to be troubled at it: <hi>David</hi> himself could say [<hi>In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord: my sore ran in the night and ceased not: my soul refused to be comforted: I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred God and was troubled: I complained and my spirit was overwhelmed: Thou holdest mine eyes waking: I am so troubled that I cannot speak.—Will the Lord cast off for ever?</hi>—] Psal. 77. 2, 3, 4, 5, 7.</p>
                     <p>Yet all the <hi>sorrowful thoughts</hi> of God, which are the duty of either the godly or the wicked, are but the necessary <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratives</hi> of their <hi>joy:</hi> It is not to <hi>melancholy, distraction</hi> or <hi>despair</hi> that God calleth <hi>any,</hi> even the <hi>worst:</hi> But it is that the <hi>wicked</hi> would [<hi>Seek the Lord while he may be found, and call upon him while he is near: that he would forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his Thoughts; and return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him, and to our God, and he will abundantly pardon</hi>] Isa. 55. 6, 7. <hi>Despair</hi> is <hi>sin;</hi> and the thoughts that tend to it are <hi>sinful thoughts,</hi> even in the <hi>wicked.</hi> If <hi>worldly crosses,</hi> or the sense of <hi>danger</hi> to the <hi>soul</hi> had cast any into <hi>melancholy,</hi> or overwhelmed them with fears, you can name nothing in the world that in reason should be so <hi>powerful a remedy</hi> to recover them, as the <hi>Thoughts of God,</hi> his <hi>Goodness</hi> and <hi>Mercy</hi> and readiness to receive and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don those that turn unto him, his <hi>Covenant,</hi> and <hi>Promises,</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> through Christ, and the everlasting happiness which all may have that will accept and seek it in the time of grace, and prefer it before the deceitful transitory pleasures of the world. If the Thoughts of God and of the Heavenly everlasting joyes, will not comfort the soul, and cure a sad despairing mind, I know not what can rationally do it. Though yet its true that a presumptuous sinner must needs be in a trembling state, till he find himself at peace with God: And mistaken Christians, that are cast into causeless doubts and fears, by the malice of Satan, are unlikely to <hi>walk com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably</hi> with God, till they are resolved and recovered from their mistakes and fears.</p>

                     <p>Obj. <hi>BUt, it may be the objector will be ready to think, that</hi> [If it be indeed our duty to walk with God, yet Thoughts are no considerable part of it: what more uncertain or mutable then our Thoughts? It is Deeds and not Thoughts that God regardeth: To do no harm to any, but to do good to all, this is indeed to walk with God. You set a man upon a trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some and impossible work, while you set him upon so strict a guard, and so much exercise of his thoughts: what cares the Almighty for my thoughts?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> 1, If God know better then you, and be to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, then <hi>Thoughts</hi> are not so inconsiderable as you sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. Doth he not say, that [<hi>the Toughts of the wicked are an abomination to the Lord?</hi> Prov. 15. 26. It is the work of the Gospel by its power, to <hi>pull down strong holds, casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalteth it self against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ,</hi> 2 Cor. 10. 4, 5. The unrighteous mans <hi>forsaking his thoughts,</hi> is part of his necessary conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, <hi>Isa.</hi> 55. 7. It was the description of the deplorate state of the old world, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 5. [<hi>God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart, was only evil continually; and it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart</hi>] Judge by this, whether <hi>Thoughts</hi> be so little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded by God, as you imagine. <hi>David</hi> saith of himself [<hi>I hate vain thoughts</hi>] Psal. 119. 113. <hi>Solomon</hi> saith, [<hi>The thoughts of the righteous are right</hi>] Prov. 12. 5. <hi>Paul</hi> saith that [<hi>Charity thinketh not evil</hi>] 1 Cor. 13. 5.</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>Thoughts</hi> are the <hi>issue</hi> of a <hi>rational soul.</hi> And if its <hi>operations</hi> be contemptible, its <hi>essence</hi> is contemptible: If its <hi>essence</hi> be noble, its <hi>operations</hi> are considerable. If the <hi>soul</hi> be more excellent then the <hi>body,</hi> its <hi>operations</hi> must be more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent. To neglect our <hi>Thoughts</hi> and not employ them upon God, and for God, is to vilisie our noblest faculties, and
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:59347:134"/>
deny God who is a spirit that spiritual service which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth.</p>
                     <p>3. Our Thoughts are commonly our most <hi>cordial voluntary</hi> acts, and shew the temper and inclination of the heart: And therefore are regardable to God that searcheth the heart, and calleth first for the service of the heart.</p>
                     <p>4. Our Thoughts are <hi>radical</hi> and <hi>instrumental</hi> acts: such as <hi>they</hi> are, such are the actions of our lives. Christ telleth us that <hi>out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies, which defile the man,</hi> Matth. 15. 19.</p>
                     <p>5. Our <hi>Thoughts</hi> are <hi>under a Law,</hi> as well as <hi>words</hi> and <hi>deeds,</hi> Prov. 24. 9. <hi>The thought of foolishness is sin</hi>] And <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 28, &amp;c. Christ extendeth the Law even to the <hi>thoughts</hi> and <hi>desires</hi> of the heart. And under the Law it is said, <hi>Deut.</hi> 15. 9. <hi>Beware that there be not a thought in thy wicked heart,</hi> &amp;c.] <hi>viz.</hi> of unmercifulness towards thy brother.</p>
                     <p>6. <hi>Thoughts</hi> can reach <hi>higher</hi> much then <hi>sense,</hi> and may be employed upon the most excellent and invisible objects, and therefore are fit instruments to elevate the soul that would converse with God. Though God be infinitely above us, our <hi>Thoughts</hi> may be exercised on him: Our <hi>persons</hi> never were in Heaven, and yet our <hi>Conversation</hi> must be in Heaven, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 20. And how is that but by our <hi>thoughts?</hi> Though we <hi>see not Christ,</hi> yet by the exercise of <hi>believing thoughts</hi> on him, we <hi>love him and rejoyce with joy unspeakable and full of glory.</hi> Though <hi>God be invisible,</hi> yet our <hi>Meditation of him may be sweet, and we may delight in the Lord,</hi> Psal. 104. 34. Say not that all this is but <hi>fantastical</hi> and <hi>delusory,</hi> as long as <hi>Thoughts</hi> of <hi>things unseen</hi> are meeter to actuate and elevate the love, desires and delights of the soul, and to move and guide us in a regular and holy life, then the <hi>sense</hi> of <hi>lesser pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi> good. The <hi>Thoughts</hi> are not <hi>vain</hi> or <hi>delusory,</hi> unless the <hi>object</hi> of them be <hi>false</hi> and <hi>vain</hi> and <hi>delusory.</hi> Where the <hi>object</hi> is <hi>great,</hi> and <hi>sure</hi> and <hi>excellent,</hi> the <hi>thoughts</hi> of such things are excellent operations of the soul. If thoughts of vainglory, wealth and pleasure, can delight the ambitious, covetous and sensual; no wonder if the <hi>Thoughts</hi> of God and life eternal afford us solid high delights.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="232" facs="tcp:59347:135"/>7. The <hi>Thoughts</hi> are not so lyable to be <hi>counterfeit</hi> and <hi>hypocritical</hi> as are the <hi>words</hi> and <hi>outward deeds:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they shew more what the <hi>man is,</hi> and what is in his heart. <hi>For</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> saith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 7. <hi>as he thinketh in his heart, so is he.</hi>]</p>
                     <p>8. Our <hi>Thoughts</hi> may <hi>exercise</hi> the <hi>highest graces</hi> of God in man; and also <hi>shew</hi> those graces, as being their <hi>effects.</hi> How is our <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>Desire,</hi> and <hi>Trust,</hi> and <hi>Joy,</hi> and <hi>Hope</hi> to be exercised but by our <hi>cogitations?</hi> If <hi>Grace</hi> were not <hi>necessary</hi> and <hi>excellent,</hi> it would not be wrought by the <hi>spirit of God,</hi> and called the <hi>Divine nature,</hi> and the <hi>image of God:</hi> And if <hi>Grace</hi> be <hi>excellent,</hi> the <hi>use</hi> and <hi>exercise</hi> of it is excellent: And therefore our <hi>Thoughts by which</hi> it is exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised must needs have their excellency too.</p>
                     <p>9. Our <hi>Thoughts</hi> must be the <hi>instruments</hi> of our <hi>improving all holy Truth</hi> in Scripture, and all the <hi>mercies</hi> which we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and all the <hi>afflictions</hi> which we undergo. What good will <hi>Reading</hi> a Chapter in the Bible do to any one that never <hi>Thinketh</hi> on it? Our <hi>delight in the Law of God</hi> must engage us to <hi>meditate in it day and night,</hi> Psal. 1. 2. What good shall he get by <hi>hearing</hi> a Sermon that exerciseth not his <hi>Thoughts</hi> for the receiving and digesting it. Our <hi>considering what is said,</hi> is the way in which we may expect that <hi>God</hi> should <hi>give us understanding in all things,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 7. What the better will he be for any of the merciful <hi>providences</hi> of God, who never <hi>bethinks</hi> him whence they come, or what is the use and end that they are given for? what good will he get by any <hi>affliction</hi> that never bethinks him, who it is that chastiseth him and for what, and how he must get them removed, and sanctified to his good? A man is but like one of the pillars in the Church, or like the corps which he treadeth on, or at best but like the dog that followeth him thither for company, if he use not his Thoughts about the work which he hath in hand, and cannot say, as <hi>Psal.</hi> 48. 9. <hi>We have thought of thy loving kindness O God in the midst of thy Temple</hi>] He that bideth you <hi>Hear,</hi> doth also bid you <hi>Take heed how you hear,</hi> Luk. 8. 18. And you are commanded to <hi>lay up the word in your heart and soul,</hi> Deut. 11. 18, 19. <hi>And to set your hearts to all the words which are testified among you: for it is not a vain thing for you, because it is your life.</hi>]</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="233" facs="tcp:59347:135"/>10. Our <hi>Thoughts</hi> are so considerable <hi>a part of Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,</hi> that they are oft put for the <hi>whole.</hi> Mal. 3. 16. <hi>A book of remembrance was written for them that feared the Lord and that Thought upon his Name</hi>] Our <hi>believing</hi> and <hi>loving</hi> God, and <hi>trusting</hi> in him, and <hi>desiring</hi> him and his grace, are the principal parts of his service, which are exercised immediately by our <hi>thoughts:</hi> And in <hi>praise</hi> and <hi>prayer</hi> it is this <hi>inward</hi> part that is the <hi>soul</hi> and <hi>life</hi> of all. He is a <hi>foolish hypocrite</hi> that thinks <hi>to be heard for his much babling,</hi> Matth. 6. 7.</p>
                     <p>And on the contrary the <hi>Thoughts</hi> are named as the sum of all <hi>iniquity,</hi> Isa. 59. 7. <hi>Their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity</hi>] Isa. 65. 2. [<hi>I have spred out my hands all the day long unto a rebellious people, which walketh in a way that was not good, after their own thoughts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi>] Jer. 4. 14. <hi>O Jerusalem, wash thy heart from wickedness that thou maist be saved: how long shall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee!</hi> Psal. 14. 1. <hi>The fool hath said in his heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there is no God.</hi>]</p>
                     <p>11. A mans <hi>Thoughts</hi> are the appointed orderly way for the <hi>Conversion of a sinner,</hi> and the preventing of his sin and misery. <hi>David</hi> saith <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 59 <hi>I thought on my wayes, and turned my feet unto thy testimonies.</hi>] The prodigal <hi>Luk.</hi> 15. 17, 18. <hi>Came to himself</hi> and returned to his Father, by the success of his own <hi>Consideration. Thus saith the Lord of Hosts, Consider your wayes,</hi>] Hag. 1. 5. is a voice that every sinner should hear. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 14. <hi>It is he that Considereth and doth not according to his Fathers sins, that shall not die.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is Gods desire, <hi>O that they were wise and understood this, and that they would consider their latter end,</hi> Deut. 32. 29. It is either mens <hi>inconsiderateness,</hi> or the <hi>errour of their thoughts,</hi> that is the cause of all their wickedness: <hi>Isa.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>My people doth not consider</hi>] Paul [<hi>verily thought</hi> that he <hi>ought to do many things against the Name of Jesus</hi>] Act. 26. 9. Many <hi>deceive themselves</hi> by <hi>thinking themselves something when they are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi> Gal. 6. 3. <hi>They think it strange that we run not with them to excess of riot:</hi> and therefore <hi>they speak evil of us,</hi> 1 Pet. 4. 4. Disobedient formalists <hi>Consider not that they do evil,</hi> when they think they are offering acceptable sacrifices to God: <hi>Eccles.</hi> 5. 1, 2. The very murder of Gods holy ones hath proceeded from these <hi>erroneous thoughts; They that kill
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:59347:136"/>
you shall think they do God service,</hi> Joh. 16. 2. All the ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and covetousness, and injustice, and cruelty following thereupon, which troubleth the world, and ruineth mens souls, is from their <hi>erroneous thoughts,</hi> overvaluing these de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful things. <hi>Psal.</hi> 49. 11. <hi>Their inward thought is that their houses shall continue for ever, and their dwelling places to all generations.</hi>] The presumptuous and impenitent are surprized by destruction, for want of <hi>thinking of it</hi> to prevent it: [<hi>In such an hour as you think not, the son of man cometh.</hi>]</p>
                     <p>12. Lastly the <hi>Thoughts</hi> are the most <hi>constant actions</hi> of a man, and therefore <hi>most</hi> of the <hi>man</hi> is in them. We are not <hi>alwayes reading,</hi> or <hi>hearing,</hi> or <hi>praying,</hi> or <hi>working:</hi> but we are <hi>alwayes Thinking.</hi> And therefore it doth especially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern us to see that this <hi>constant breath</hi> of the soul be sweet, and that this <hi>constant stream</hi> be pure and run in the right channel. Well therefore did <hi>David</hi> make this his request, <hi>Psal.</hi> 139. 23, 24. <hi>Search me O God and know my heart: try me and know my thoughts; and see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.</hi> I say therefore to those that insist on this irrational objection, that <hi>these very Thoughts of theirs,</hi> concerning the <hi>inconsiderableness of Thoughts,</hi> are so foolish and ungodly, that when they understand the evil even of <hi>these,</hi> they will know that <hi>Thoughts</hi> were more to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded. [<hi>If therefore thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thy self, or if thou hast thought evil, lay thy hand upon thy mouth.</hi>]</p>
                     <p>And though, after all this, I still confess that it is so exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hard a matter to keep the thoughts in <hi>holy exercise</hi> and <hi>order,</hi> that even the <hi>best</hi> do daily and hourly sin, in the omissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the disorder or the vanity of their thoughts, yet for all that we must needs conclude that the <hi>inclination</hi> and <hi>design</hi> of our <hi>Thoughts</hi> must be principally for God, and that the <hi>Thoughts</hi> are <hi>principal instruments</hi> of the soul, in acting it in his service, and moving it towards him, and in all this holy work of our <hi>Walking with God:</hi> And therefore to imagine that <hi>Thoughts</hi> are <hi>inconsiderable</hi> and of little use, is to unman us and unchristen us. The <hi>labour of the mind</hi> is necessary for the attaining the <hi>felicity of the mind,</hi>

You cannot expect that <hi>God appear to you</hi> in a <hi>bodily shape,</hi> that you may have <hi>immediate converse with him in the body:</hi> The <hi>corporal eating</hi> of him in <hi>transubstantiate bread,</hi> supposed common to men and mice or dogs, we leave to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, who have made themselves a singular new Religion, in despight of the common sense and reason of mankind, as well as of the Scriptures and the judgement of the Church: It is <hi>in the spirit</hi> that you must converse with <hi>God who is a spirit.</hi> The <hi>mind</hi> seeth <hi>him by faith,</hi> who <hi>is invisible</hi> to the <hi>bodily</hi> eyes.

But our conceivings of him must be <hi>spiritual,</hi> and Minds that are immerst in flesh and earth, are unmeet to hold communion with him: The <hi>natural man</hi> knoweth him not, and the <hi>carnal mind</hi> is <hi>enmity to him, aend they that are in the flesh cannot please him,</hi> Rom. 8.

                           <p>§. 2. I. To <hi>Walk with God in a Holy and Heavenly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation,</hi> is the employment most <hi>suitable to humane nature,</hi> not to its <hi>corrupt disposition,</hi> nor to the <hi>carnal interest</hi> and <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite;</hi> but to <hi>nature as nature,</hi> to <hi>man as man:</hi> It is the very work that he was made for: The faculties and frame of soul and body <hi>were composed</hi> for it by the wise <hi>Creatour:</hi> They are <hi>restored</hi> for it by the gracious <hi>Redeemer.</hi> Though in <hi>corrupted</hi> nature where sensuality is predominant, there is an estranged<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness from God, and an enmity and hatred of him, so that the wicked are more a verse to all serious holy converse with him (in prayer, contemplation, and a heavenly life) then they are to a worldly sinful life; yet all this is but the <hi>disease</hi> of <hi>nature,</hi> corrupting its appetite, and turning it against that proper food, which is most suitable to its sound desires, and necessary to its health and happiness. Though sinful habits are become as it were a second Nature to the ungodly, so depraving their judgements and desires, that they verily think the business and pleasures of the flesh are most suitable to them; yet these are as contrary to <hi>nature as nature,</hi> that is, to the primitive ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies of all our faculties, and the proper use to which they were fitted by our Creatour, and to that true felicity which is the end of all our parts and powers, even as <hi>madness</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the <hi>rational nature,</hi> though it were hereditary.</p>
                           <p>1. What can be more agreeable to the <hi>nature</hi> of man, then to be <hi>rational</hi> and <hi>wise,</hi> and to live in the purest <hi>exercise</hi> of <hi>Reason?</hi> And certainly there is nothing more <hi>rational</hi> then that we should live to God, and gladly accept of all that communion with him which our natures on earth are capable of. Nothing can be more <hi>Reasonable</hi> then for the <hi>Reasonable soul</hi> to be entirely addicted to him that did create it, that doth preserve it, and by whom it doth subsist and act. Nothing is more <hi>Reasonable</hi> then that the Absolute Lord of nature be honoured and served wholly by his Own: Nothing is more Reasonable then that the Reasonable creature do live in the
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:59347:137"/>
truest dependence upon, and subordination to the <hi>Highest Reason;</hi> and that derived, imperfect, defectible wisdome, be subservient to, and guided by the primitive, perfect, inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectible wisdome: It is most reasonable that the <hi>Children</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the <hi>Father,</hi> and the <hi>foolish</hi> be ruled by the <hi>most wise,</hi> and that the <hi>Subjects</hi> be governed by the <hi>universal King;</hi> and that they honour him and obey him, and that the <hi>indigent</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply themselves to him that is <hi>All sufficient,</hi> and is most able and ready to supply their wants; and that the <hi>Importent</hi> rest upon him that is <hi>Omnipotent.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>2. Nothing can be <hi>more Reasonable,</hi> than that the Reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Nature should intend <hi>its End,</hi> and seek after <hi>its true</hi> and <hi>chief felicity:</hi> And that it should <hi>Love Good as Good,</hi> and therefore prefer the <hi>chiefest Good</hi> before that which is transi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory and insufficient. Reason commandeth the Reasonable Creature to avoid its own delusion and destruction, and to rest upon him that can everlastingly support us, and not upon the creature that will deceive us and undo us: and to prefer the highest and noblest converse before that which is inferiour, unprofitable and base, and that we rejoyce more in the highest, purest, and most durable delights, than in those that are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did, and of short continuance. And who knoweth not that God is the chiefest Good, and true felicity of man, the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Rock, the durable delight, and to be preferred before his creatures? And who might not find that would use his Reason, that all things below are vanity and vexation?</p>
                           <p>3. Nothing can be more Rational and Agreeable to Mans Nature, than that the superiour faculties should govern the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour, that the brutish part be subject to the Rational; and that the ends and objects of this higher faculty be preferred before the objects of the lower, that the objects of sense be made subservient to the objects of Reason. If this be not <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> and <hi>Rational,</hi> then it is <hi>natural to Man to be no Man,</hi> but a <hi>Beast,</hi> and <hi>Reasonable</hi> to be <hi>Unreasonable.</hi> Now it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that a <hi>Holy Living unto God,</hi> is but the improvement of <hi>true Reason,</hi> and its imployment <hi>for</hi> and <hi>upon</hi> its noblest ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and its ultimate End: And that a <hi>sensual life</hi> is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of the inferiour brutish faculties, in predominacy above and before the rational: And therefore to question whether
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:59347:138"/>
                              <hi>God</hi> or the <hi>Creature</hi> should be first sought, and loved, and principally desired, and delighted in, and served, is but to question whether we should live like <hi>Men</hi> or like <hi>Beasts,</hi> and whether <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                                    <desc>•</desc>
                                 </gap>gs</hi> or <hi>wise men</hi> be fitter companions for us? and whether the <hi>Rider</hi> or the <hi>Horse</hi> should have the rule? whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Rational</hi> or <hi>Sensitive</hi> Powers be superiour and proper to the nature of a man?</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Object.</hi> But there is a middle state of life betwixt the sensual and the Divine or Holy Life which sober Philosophers did live, and this is the most <hi>Natural Life,</hi> and most properly so called.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Answ.</hi> I deny this: There is no middle state of life, if you denominate the several states of life, from the <hi>several Ends,</hi> or the several <hi>Powers.</hi> I grant that the very sensitive powers in man, especially the imagination, is much advanced by the conjunction of Reason, above that of a brute: And I grant that the Delights of the Phantasie may be preferred before the immediate pleasure of the senses: And I grant that some little distant knowledge of God, and things Divine, and Hopes of attaining them, may affect an unsanctified man with an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable pleasure. But all this is nothing to prove that there is a <hi>third</hi> sort of <hi>End,</hi> or of <hi>Powers,</hi> and so a third or middle state of life, specifically distinct from the <hi>sensitive</hi> and the <hi>Holy life.</hi> Besides, the <hi>Vegetative</hi> man hath no other <hi>life</hi> or faculties, than the <hi>Sensitive</hi> and the <hi>Rational:</hi> And therefore one of these must be in predominancy or rule. And therefore he can have no middle sort or <hi>End;</hi> and therefore no middle state of life, that can be said to be agreeable to his nature. Those that seek and take up their chief felicity in Riches and plenty, and provisions for the flesh, though not in <hi>present</hi> pleasing of the sense, do live but the life of sensuality. A Fox or Dog takes pleasure when he hath eaten his belly full, to hide and lay up the rest: And so doth the Bee to fill the Hive, and make provision for the Winter. The Proud that delight in Honour and applause, and making others subject to their lusts, do live but the life of sensuality: A Dog, a Horse, and other brutes, have something of the same. They that are grave through Melancholy, or because they can reach no great matter in the world, and because their old or duller spirits are not much pleased with juvenile delights, and so live retiredly, and
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:59347:138"/>
                              <hi>seek no higher pleasure</hi> or <hi>felicity,</hi> but only sit down with the <hi>weeping</hi> or the <hi>laughing</hi> Philosopher, <hi>lamenting</hi> or <hi>deriding</hi> the Vanity of the world, do yet live no other than a sensual life: as an old Dog that hath no pleasure in hunting or playful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, as he had when he was a Whelp. Only he is less deluded and less vain, than other sensualists that find more pleasure in their course.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>All the doubt</hi> is concerning those that place their <hi>felicity</hi> in <hi>Knowledge,</hi> and those that delight in <hi>Moral Vertues,</hi> or that delight in <hi>studying of God,</hi> though they are no Christians.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Answ.</hi> The point is weighty, and hath oft unhappily faln into injudicious hands. I shall endeavour to resolve it as tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, clearly and impartially as I can. 1. It is a great errour against the Nature of man, to say, that <hi>Knowledge</hi> as such, is fit to be any mans chief and ultimate End. It may be that act which is <hi>next</hi> the <hi>Enjoying Act</hi> of the <hi>Will,</hi> which is it that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is next the End, objectively considered: But it is not that Act which we call <hi>Ultimate Ultimus.</hi> And this is plain 1. Because the <hi>Object</hi> of the <hi>Understanding,</hi> which is <hi>Truth,</hi> is not <hi>formally</hi> the nearest object or matter of full <hi>fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity</hi> or delight: It is <hi>Goodness</hi> that is the nearest object. 2. And therefore the office of the <hi>Intellect</hi> is but introductive and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servient to the office of the <hi>Will,</hi> to apprehend the <hi>Verity</hi> of <hi>Good,</hi> and present it to the will to be prosecuted or embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, or delighted in. There are many <hi>Truths</hi> that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful and vexatious, and which men would wish to be no truths: And there is a knowledge which is troublesome, use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, undesirable and tormenting, which even a wise man would fain avoid if he knew how. Morality is but prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively in the intellect: and therefore intellectual acts as such are not morally Good, or evil, but only participatively, as subject to the Will. And therefore knowledge as such being not a <hi>Moral Good,</hi> can be no other than such a <hi>Natural Good</hi> as is <hi>Bonum alicui,</hi> only so far as it tendeth to some <hi>Welfare</hi> or <hi>Happiness,</hi> or pleasure of the possessor or some other: And this <hi>Welfare</hi> or <hi>Pleasure</hi> is either that which is suited to the <hi>Sensitive Powers,</hi> or to the <hi>Rational</hi> (which is to be found in the love of God alone.)</p>
                           <p>2. I add therefore that even those men that seem to take up
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:59347:139"/>
their <hi>felicity</hi> in common <hi>Knowledge,</hi> indeed do but make their <hi>Knowledge subservient</hi> to something else which they take for their felicity. For <hi>Knowledge</hi> of <hi>Evil</hi> may Torment them. It is only to <hi>know</hi> something which they take to be <hi>Good,</hi> that is their <hi>Delight.</hi> And it is the <hi>Complacency</hi> or <hi>Love</hi> of that <hi>Good</hi> at the <hi>Heart,</hi> which sets them on work, and causeth the delight of Knowing. If you will say that common <hi>Knowledge as Knowledge</hi> doth <hi>immediately</hi> Delight, yet will it be found but such a pleasing of the <hi>Phantasie,</hi> as an Ape hath in spying marvels, which if it have no end that's higher, is still but a sensitive Delight; but if it be referred to a higher Delight (in God) doth participate of the nature of it. <hi>Delight</hi> in general is the common end of Men and Brutes: But <hi>in specie</hi> they are distinguished as <hi>Sensual</hi> or <hi>Rational.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>3. If you suppose a Philosopher to be Delighted in studying Mathematicks, or any of the works of God, either he hath herein <hi>an End,</hi> or <hi>no End</hi> beyond the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of the <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:</hi> Either he <hi>terminateth</hi> his desires and delights in the <hi>Creature,</hi> or else <hi>useth it</hi> as a means to raise him to the <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour.</hi> If he study and delight in the <hi>Creature ultimately,</hi> this is indeed the Act of a <hi>rational Creature,</hi> and an act of <hi>Reason,</hi> as to the faculty it proceeds from (and so is a <hi>Rational Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance</hi> for <hi>sensual ends and pleasures:</hi>) But it is but the <hi>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour</hi> of <hi>Reason,</hi> and is no more agreeable to the <hi>Rational Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> than the <hi>deceit</hi> of the <hi>senses</hi> is to the <hi>sensitive.</hi> Nor is it <hi>finally</hi> to be numbred with the operations felicitating humane nature, any more than an erroneous dream of pleasure, or than that man is to be numbred with the lovers of learning, who taketh pleasure in the binding, leaves or letters of the book, while he understandeth nothing of the sense. But if this Philosopher seek to know the <hi>Creatour</hi> in and by the <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> and take delight in the <hi>Makers Power, Wisdome and Goodness,</hi> which appeareth in them, then this is <hi>truly</hi> a <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Delight,</hi> in it self considered, and beseeming a man. And if he reach so far in it, as to make <hi>God his Highest desire and delight,</hi> overpowring the desires and delights of sensuali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he shall be <hi>happy,</hi> as being led by the <hi>Son</hi> unto the <hi>Father:</hi> But if he make but some <hi>little approaches towards it,</hi> and drown all such desires in the <hi>sensual desires</hi> and <hi>delights,</hi> he
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:59347:139"/>
is then but an unhappy <hi>sensualist,</hi> and liveth <hi>brutishly</hi> in the <hi>tenor</hi> of his life, though in <hi>some acts</hi> in part he operate <hi>rational<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> as a man.</p>
                           <p>The like I may say of them that are said to place their <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light</hi> in <hi>Moral Vertues.</hi> Indeed nothing is properly a <hi>Moral Good</hi> (or vertue) but that which is exercised upon <hi>God</hi> as our <hi>End,</hi> or upon the Creature as a <hi>Means</hi> to this <hi>End.</hi> To study and know meer <hi>notions</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> or what is to be held and said of him in discourse, is not to study or to <hi>know God,</hi> no more than to love the language and phrase of holy writing, is to <hi>Love God.</hi> To study <hi>God</hi> as one that is <hi>less regardable</hi> and desirable than our <hi>sensual delights,</hi> is but to blaspheme him. To study seek and serve him as one that can promote or hinder our sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual felicity, is but to abuse him as a means to your sensuality. And for the vertues of Temperance, Justice or Charity, they are but Analogically and <hi>secundum quid</hi> to be found in any ungodly person. <hi>Materially</hi> they may have them in an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent degree; but not as they are <hi>informed</hi> by the <hi>End</hi> which moralizeth them. <hi>Jezabel's</hi> fast was not formally a vertue, but an odious way of Hypocrisie to oppress the innocent: He that doth works of <hi>Justice</hi> or <hi>Mercy,</hi> to <hi>Evil ends</hi> only (as for applause, or to deceive, &amp;c.) and not from the true principles of <hi>Justice</hi> and <hi>Mercy,</hi> doth not thereby exercise Moral Vertue, but hypocrisie, and other vice. He that doth works of <hi>Justice and Mercy,</hi> out of meer natural compassion to others, and desire of their good, without respect to God, as obliging, or rewarding, or desiring it, doth perform such a <hi>natural good work,</hi> as a Lamb or a gentle Beast doth to his fellows, which hath not the true form of Moral Vertue, but the Matter only. He that in such works hath some little by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respect to God, but more to his carnal interest among men, doth that which on the <hi>by,</hi> participateth of Moral Good, or is such <hi>secundum quid,</hi> but not <hi>simpliciter,</hi> being to be <hi>denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated</hi> from the <hi>part predominant.</hi> He that doth works of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice</hi> or <hi>Charity principally</hi> to <hi>please God,</hi> and in <hi>true obedience</hi> to <hi>his Will,</hi> and a desire to be conformed thereto, doth that which is <hi>formally a Moral Good,</hi> and <hi>Holy,</hi> though there may be abhorred mixtures of worse respects.</p>
                           <p>So that there are but two states of life here: One of those
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:59347:140"/>
that <hi>walk after the flesh,</hi> and the other of those that <hi>walk after the spirit:</hi> However the flesh hath several materials and waies of pleasure: And even the <hi>Rational actings</hi> that have a <hi>carnal end,</hi> are <hi>carnal finally</hi> and <hi>morally,</hi> though they are acts of Reason; For they are but the <hi>errours</hi> of Reason, and defectiveness of true Rationality; and being but the acts of <hi>erroneous Reason</hi> as captivated by the <hi>flesh,</hi> and subservient to the <hi>carnal Interest,</hi> they are themselves to be denominated <hi>carnal:</hi> And so even the Reasonable soul as byassed by sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suality, and captivated thereto, is included in the name of [<hi>Flesh</hi>] in Scripture.</p>
                           <p>How much Moral Good is in that course of Piety or Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to God, which proceedeth only from the <hi>Fear</hi> of Gods Judgements, without any Love to him, I shall not now discuss, because I have too far digrest already.</p>
                           <p>All that I have last said, is to shew you the Reasonableness of Living unto God, as being indeed the proper and just em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of the superiour faculties of the soul, and their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the lower faculties. For if any other called <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralists</hi> do seem to subject the <hi>Sensual</hi> life to the <hi>Rational,</hi> either they do <hi>but seem</hi> to do so; the sensual interest being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed predominant, and their rational operations subjected thereto: or at the best, it is but some poor and erroneous em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of the Rational faculties which they exercise, or some weak approaches towards that high and holy life, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the life which the Rational nature was created for, and which is the right improvement of it.</p>
                           <p>4. Moreover, nothing is more beseeming the nature of man, than to <hi>aspire after the highest and noblest improvement of it self;</hi> and to live the <hi>most excellent life</hi> that it is capable of. For every nature tendeth to its <hi>own perfection.</hi> But it is most evident that to <hi>Walk with God in Holiness,</hi> is a thing that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature is capable of; and that is the highest life that we are capable of on earth: And therefore it is the life most suitable to our natures.</p>
                           <p>5. And what can be more Rational and beseeming a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Nature, than to <hi>live to those ends, which our Creatour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in the fabrication of our Natures?</hi> It is <hi>His Ends</hi> that are principally to be served. But the very composure of our facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:59347:140"/>
plainly prove, that <hi>His End</hi> was that we should be fitted for <hi>His Service:</hi> He gave us no powers or capacity in vain: And therefore to serve him and walk with him, is most suitable to our natures.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Obj.</hi> That is Natural which is first, and born with us: But our enmity to Holiness is first, and not our Holiness.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Answ.</hi> It may be called <hi>Natural</hi> indeed, because it is <hi>first,</hi> and born with us: And in <hi>that respect</hi> we confess that sin and not Holiness is Natural to us. But Holiness is called <hi>Natural</hi> to us, in a higher respect, because it was the Primitive Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral constitution of man, and was <hi>before</hi> sin, and is the perfection or health of nature, and the right employment and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, and tends to its happiness. An hereditary lepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie may be called<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                              <hi>Natural,</hi> as it is <hi>first,</hi> and before <hi>health</hi> in that <hi>person:</hi> But <hi>health</hi> and <hi>soundness</hi> is <hi>Natural,</hi> as being the <hi>well-being</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> when the <hi>Leprosie</hi> is unnatural, as being but its <hi>desease,</hi> and tending to its destruction.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Obj.</hi> But Nature in its first constitution was not Holy, but Innocent only, and it was by a superadded gift of Grace that it became Holy as some Schoolmen think; and as others think, <hi>Adam</hi> had no Holiness till his restoration.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Answ.</hi> These are Popish improved fancies, and contrary to Nature and the Word of God. 1. They are nowhere written, nor have no evidence in Nature, and therefore are the ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less dreams of men.</p>
                           <p>2. The work of our recovery to God is called in Scripture a <hi>Redemption, Renovation, Restoration,</hi> which imply that <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> was once in that <hi>Holy</hi> estate before the fall. And it is expresly said, that the <hi>New man</hi> which we <hi>put on</hi> is <hi>renewed in knowledge after the Image of him that created him</hi>] Col. 3. 10. And after Gods Image <hi>Adam</hi> was created.</p>
                           <p>3. If it belong to the soundness and integrity of <hi>Nature</hi> to be <hi>Holy</hi> (that is, disposed and addicted to live to God) then it is an abusive temerity, for men out of their own imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to feign, that God <hi>first</hi> made <hi>Nature defective,</hi> and then <hi>mended</hi> it by <hi>superadded Grace.</hi> But if it belong <hi>not</hi> to the <hi>soundness</hi> and <hi>integrity</hi> of humane <hi>Nature</hi> to be <hi>Holy,</hi> then why did God give him Grace to make him so? Nay then, it would follow that when God sanctified <hi>Adam,</hi> or any since, he made
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:59347:141"/>
him specifically another thing, another creature, of another nature, and did not only cure the diseases of his nature.</p>
                           <p>4. It is yet apparent in the very Nature of mans faculties, that their very usefulness and tendency, is to live to God, and to enjoy him: And that God should make a Nature apt for such a use, and give it <hi>no disposedness</hi> to its proper use, is an unnatural conceit. We see to this day that it is but an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable abuse of Reason, when it is not used Holily for God; and it is a very disease of nature to be otherwise dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed. Therefore Primitive Nature had such a Holy inclination.</p>
                           <p>5. The contrary opinion tendeth to <hi>Infidelity,</hi> and to bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie humane Nature. For if no man can believe that he must be Holy and live to God, and enjoy him hereafter in Heaven, but he that also believeth that <hi>Primitive Nature</hi> was never <hi>disposed</hi> or qualified for such a life; and that God must first make a man another creature <hi>in specie,</hi> of another nature (and consequently not a man) this is not only so improbable, but so contrary to Scripture and Reason, that few considerate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons would believe it. As if we must believe that God would turn brutes into men. God healeth, elevateth and perfecteth Nature, but doth not specificially change it, at least in this life.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Obj.</hi> But let it be granted that he giveth not man specifically another Nature, yet he may give him such higher gifts, as may be like another Nature to him so far.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Answ.</hi> No doubt he may and doth give him such gifts as actuate and perfect Nature: but some <hi>Disposition</hi> to <hi>our ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate end</hi> is <hi>essential</hi> to our <hi>Nature;</hi> and therefore to assign man <hi>another ultimate end,</hi> and to give a <hi>Disposition</hi> to it, of which he had no seed, or part, or principle before, is to make him <hi>another creature.</hi> I confess that in <hi>lapsed man,</hi> the <hi>Holy Disposition</hi> is so far dead, as that the change maketh a man a <hi>New Creature</hi> in a <hi>Moral sense</hi> (as be is a <hi>New Man</hi> that changeth his mind and manners:) But still Nature hath its aptitude as Rational to be employed for its Maker; so that he is not a New Creature in a <hi>Natural sense.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>An <hi>actual</hi> or <hi>habitual willingness</hi> to this Holy employment, a <hi>promptitude</hi> to it, and a due understanding of it, is the <hi>New Creature Morally</hi> so called which is given in our sanctification: But the <hi>Natural aptitude</hi> that is in our faculties as <hi>Rational,</hi>
                              <pb n="245" facs="tcp:59347:141"/>
to this holy life, is <hi>essential</hi> to us <hi>as men,</hi> or <hi>as Rational;</hi> even to have the <hi>Potentiam naturalem</hi> which must yet have further help or moral life to actuate it. And <hi>Adam</hi> had both these: The one he retained, or else he had not continued a man, The other <hi>he lost,</hi> or else he had not had need of Renovation.</p>
                           <p>6. If <hi>Adams Nature</hi> had not been <hi>Disposed to God</hi> as to his <hi>End</hi> and <hi>Soveraign,</hi> then the Law of Nature (to adhere to God, and obey and serve him) was not written in his heart: And then it would not have been his duty to adhere to God, and to obey and serve him; which is so false, that even in <hi>lapsed unrenewed Nature,</hi> there is left <hi>so much aptitude</hi> hereto, as will prove him to be still <hi>under the obligations</hi> of this Law of <hi>Nature,</hi> even <hi>actually to adhere to God,</hi> and <hi>to obey him,</hi> which a dead man, a mad man, or an Infant is not (immediately.)</p>
                           <p>By all this you see, that though the <hi>blindness</hi> and <hi>disease</hi> of <hi>Reason,</hi> is contrary to faith and holiness, yet <hi>Reason it self</hi> is so much for it, as that Faith it self is but the act of <hi>elevated well informed Reason;</hi> and supernatural Revelation is but the means to inform our <hi>Reason,</hi> about things which have not a natural evidence, discernable by us. And sanctification (actively taken) is but the <hi>healing</hi> of our <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Rational appetite:</hi> And <hi>Holiness</hi> is but the <hi>health</hi> or soundness of them. The <hi>errour</hi> of Reason must be renounced by Believers; but not the <hi>use</hi> of Reason: The <hi>sufficiency</hi> of Reason and Natural Light without supernatural Light and Help, we must all deny: But to set Reason as Reason in opposition to <hi>Faith</hi> or <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> or <hi>Divine Revelation,</hi> is as gross a piece of foolery, as to set the visive faculty in opposition to the Light of the Sun, or to its objects. It is the <hi>unreasonableness</hi> of sinners that is to be cured by <hi>Illuminating Grace. They are wise to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge.</hi> Their Reason is wounded, depraved and corrupted about the matters of God: They have Reason to <hi>serve</hi> the flesh, but not to <hi>Master</hi> it. God doth renew men by giving them <hi>wisdome,</hi> and bringing them to a <hi>sound mind;</hi> As <hi>Logick</hi> helpeth <hi>Reason</hi> in discourse and arguing, so <hi>Theology</hi> informeth <hi>Reason</hi> about the matters of God and our salvation: and the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> doth make his Doctrine and Revelation effectual. Make <hi>Nature sound,</hi> and <hi>Reason clear,</hi> &amp; then we will consent that all men be perswaded
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:59347:142"/>
to live according to their <hi>Nature</hi> and their <hi>Reason.</hi> But if a <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam</hi> will rave and tear himself and others, and say, this is accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>my Nature or my Reason;</hi> it is fitter that chains and whips do cure that <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Reason,</hi> than that he be allowed to live according to his madness. If a <hi>Drunkard</hi> or <hi>Whoremonger</hi> will say, <hi>My Nature</hi> and <hi>Reason</hi> incline mee to please my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite and lust, it is fit that the <hi>swinish Nature</hi> be corrected, and the <hi>beast</hi> which rideth and ruleth the <hi>man,</hi> be taken down<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and when indeed his <hi>Nature</hi> is the <hi>Nature of a man,</hi> and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the use and ends that it was <hi>made for, then</hi> let him live ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to it and spare not. If a <hi>malicious</hi> man will abuse or kill his neighbours, and say, This is according to <hi>my Nature,</hi> let <hi>that Nature</hi> be used as the <hi>Nature</hi> of Wolves and Foxes, and other noxious creatures are. But let humane Nature be cured of its blindness, carnality and cortuption, and then it will need no external testimony to convince it, that no em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment is so <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>suitable</hi> to man, as to <hi>Walk with God, in Love and Confidence,</hi> and reverent Worship, and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Obedience to his Will. A worldly fleshly sensual life, will then appear to be below the rational nature of a man, as it is below us to go to grass with horses, or to live as meer compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of brutes. It will then appear to be as <hi>natural</hi> for us to Love and Live to our Creatour and Redeemer, and to <hi>Walk with God,</hi> as for a <hi>Child</hi> to love his Parents, and to live with them and serve them. When I say that this is <hi>Natural,</hi> I mean not that it is <hi>Necessary</hi> by <hi>Natural Necessity,</hi> or that Grace doth operate <hi>per modum naturae,</hi> as the irrational motion is so called. There is a <hi>Brutish</hi> or <hi>Inanimate Nature,</hi> and there is a <hi>Rational Voluntary Nature:</hi> Grace worketh not according to the way of <hi>Inanimate</hi> or <hi>Brutish Nature,</hi> but according to the way of <hi>Rational Nature,</hi> in <hi>free Agents.</hi> I may well say that whatever is <hi>Rational,</hi> is <hi>Natural</hi> to a <hi>Rational</hi> Creature as such, so far as he discerneth it. Yea and <hi>Habits,</hi> though they <hi>effect not necessarily,</hi> but <hi>freely</hi> in a <hi>Rational nature,</hi> yet they <hi>Incline Necessarily, &amp; per modum naturae.</hi> They contain in their being a <hi>Natural aptitude</hi> and <hi>propensity</hi> to action.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Obj.</hi> But thus you confound Nature and Grace, Natural and supernatural operations, while you make Grace Natural.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Answ.</hi> No such matter: Though <hi>walking with God</hi> be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:59347:142"/>
                              <hi>Natural,</hi> as it is most agreeable to Nature so far as it is <hi>sound,</hi> and is the felicity and meetest employment of the rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal nature as such; Yet 1. <hi>Diseased nature</hi> doth abhor it, as a diseased stomack the pleasantest and most wholesome food (as I said before.) 2. And this disease of Nature cannot he cured without Divine supernatural Grace. So that as to the <hi>efficient cause,</hi> our Holinesse is supernatural. But it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sound doctrine of those that affirm that <hi>Adam</hi> in his <hi>pure Natural state of innocency,</hi> had no <hi>Natural Holiness,</hi> or <hi>apti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi> and <hi>promptitude</hi> to <hi>Walk with God in order to everlasting happiness;</hi> but say that all this was either <hi>wanting</hi> to him, and was a <hi>state specifically distinct,</hi> which he fell short off by his sin, or that it was <hi>given him by superadded Grace,</hi> and was not in his <hi>entire Nature.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>And yet we deny not but as to <hi>Degrees, Adams</hi> nature was to grow up to more perfection: and that his <hi>Natural Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> contained not a <hi>sufficient immediate aptitude</hi> and <hi>prompti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi> to every duty which might afterward be required of him; but this was to be obtained in the <hi>exercise</hi> of that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness which he had: Even as a Vine or other fruit tree, though it be <hi>Natural</hi> to it to bear its proper fruit, yet hath it not an <hi>immediate sufficient aptitude</hi> hereto, whilst it is but appearing out of the seed, before it be grown up to just ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity. Or as it is <hi>Natural</hi> to a man to <hi>discourse</hi> and <hi>reason;</hi> but yet his <hi>nature</hi> in infancy, or untaught and unexercised, hath not a <hi>sufficient immediate aptitude</hi> and <hi>promptitude</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. Or as <hi>Grace</hi> inclineth a <hi>renewed soul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                              </hi> to every holy <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>duty:</hi> and yet such a soul in its infancy of Grace, hath not a <hi>sufficient immediate aptitude</hi> or <hi>promptitude</hi> to the receiving of every holy truth, or the doing of every holy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but must grow up to it by degrees. But the addition of these <hi>degrees,</hi> is no <hi>specifical alteration</hi> of the nature of man, or of that grace which was before received.</p>
                           <p>Having been so long upon this first Consideration (that Walking with God is most agreeable to humane nature) I shall be briefer in the rest that follow.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div n="2" type="part">

                           <p>II. TO Walk with God and live to him, is incomparably the <hi>Highest</hi> and <hi>Noblest</hi> life. To converse with men only, is to converse with Worms: whether they be Princes or poor men, they differ but as the bigger vermine from the lesser. If they be <hi>Wise</hi> and <hi>Good,</hi> their Converse may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable and delightful, because they have a beam of excellency from the face of God: (And O how unspeakable is the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance between <hi>his Wisdom and Goodness,</hi> and <hi>theirs!</hi>) But if they be <hi>foolish, ungodly</hi> and <hi>dishonest,</hi> how loathsome is their conversation? What stinking breath is in their profane and filthy language? in their lies and slanders of the just? in their sottish jears and scorns of those that Walk with God? which expose at once their <hi>folly</hi> and <hi>misery</hi> to the pitty of all that are truly understanding. When they are gravely speaking evil of the things which they understand not, or with a fleering confidence deriding merrily the holy commands and waies of God, they are much more lamentably expressing their infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation, than any that are kept in chains in <hi>Bedlam:</hi> Though indeed with the most they scape the reputation which they deserve, because they are attended with persons of their own proportion of wisdom, that alwayes reverence a silken coat, and judge them wise that wear gold lace, and have the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est satisfaction of their wills and lusts, and are able to do most mischief in the world: and because <hi>good men</hi> have learnt to <hi>honour</hi> the <hi>worst</hi> of their <hi>superiours,</hi> and not to <hi>call them</hi> as they <hi>are.</hi> But <hi>God</hi> is bold to <hi>call them</hi> as they <hi>are,</hi> and give them in his word, such names and characters by which they <hi>might</hi> come to know themselves. And is it not a <hi>Higher<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Nobler</hi> life to <hi>Walk with God,</hi> then to <hi>Converse in Bedlam,</hi> or with intoxicated sensualists, that live in a constant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liration?</p>
                           <p>Yea worse then so: <hi>ungodly</hi> men are <hi>children of the Devil,</hi> so called by Jesus Christ himself, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 44. because they have much of the <hi>nature</hi> of the <hi>Devil,</hi> and the <hi>lusts of their father they will do;</hi> yea they are <hi>taken captive by him at his will,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 26. They are the <hi>servants of sin,</hi> and do the drudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that so vile a Master sets them on, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 34. Certainly as
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:59347:143"/>
the spirits of the just are so <hi>like to Angels,</hi> that Christ saith, we shall be <hi>as they</hi> and <hi>equal to them;</hi> so the wicked are nearer kin to <hi>Devils</hi> then they themselves will easily believe. They are as <hi>like him</hi> as <hi>children</hi> to <hi>their Father:</hi> He is a <hi>lyar,</hi> and so are <hi>they:</hi> He is a <hi>hater of God,</hi> and godliness, and godly men, and so are <hi>they:</hi> He is a murderer, and would fain devour the holy seed; and such are they. He envyeth the progress of the Gospel, and the prosperity of the Church, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of Holiness; and so do they. He hath a special ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice against the most powerful and successful Preachers of the Word of God, and against the most zealous and eminent Saints; and so have they. He cares not by what lyes and fictions he disgraceth them, nor how cruelly he useth them; No more do they, (or some of them at least:) He cherisheth licentiousness, sensuality and impiety; and so do they. If they do seem better in their adversity and restraint, yet try them but with prosperity, and power, and you shall see quickly how like they are to devils. And shall we delight more to converse with <hi>brutes</hi> and incarnate <hi>devils,</hi> than <hi>with God?</hi> Is it not a more high and excellent conversation to <hi>Walk with God,</hi> and live to Him, then to be companions of such <hi>degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate men,</hi> that have almost forfeited the reputation of <hi>huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity?</hi> Alas, they are companions so deluded and ignorant, and yet so wilfull; so miserable, and yet so confident and secure, that they are, to a believing eye, the most lamentable sight that the whole world can shew us out of hell. And how sad a life must it then needs be, to converse with such, were it not for the hope that we have of furthering their recovery and Salvation!</p>
                           <p>But to <hi>Walk with God</hi> is a <hi>word</hi> so high, that I should have feared the guilt of <hi>arrogance</hi> in using it, if I had not found it in the holy Scriptures. It is a word that importeth so high and holy a frame of soul, and expresseth such high and holy actions, that the <hi>naming</hi> of it striketh my heart with rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as if I had heard the voice to <hi>Moses [Put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground</hi>] Exod. 3. 5. Methinks he that shall say to me, <hi>Come see a man that walks with God,</hi> doth call me to see one that is next unto an <hi>Angel,</hi> or <hi>glorified soul!</hi> It is a far more reverend
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:59347:144"/>
object in mine eye, then ten thousand Lords or Princes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered only in their fleshly glory. It is a <hi>wiser action</hi> for people to run and crowd together, to <hi>see</hi> a man that <hi>Walks with God,</hi> then to see the pompous train of Princes, their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments, or their triumphs. O happy man, that <hi>Walks with God,</hi> though neglected and contemned by all about him! What blessed sights doth he daily see! What ravishing tydings, what pleasant melody doth he daily hear, unless it be in his swoons or sickness! what delectable food doth he daily tast! He seeth by faith the God, the Glory, which the blessed Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits see at hand by nearest intuition: He seeth that in a glass and darkly, which they behold with open face: He seeth the glorious Majesty of his Creatour, the Eternal King, the Cause of Causes, the composer, upholder, preserver, and governour of all the worlds: He beholdeth the wonderful methods of his providence: And what he cannot reach to see, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mireth, and waiteth for the time when that also shall be open to his view! He seeth by Faith the world of Spirits, the hosts that attend the throne of God; their perfect righteousnesse, their full devotednesse to God; their ardent love, their flaming zeal, their ready and chearful obedience, their dignity and shining glory, in which the lowest of them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth that which the Disciples saw on <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> when they appeared on the holy Mount, and talkt with Christ. They hear by faith the heavenly consort, the high and harmonious Songs of praise, the joyful triumphs of crowned Saints, the sweet commemorations of the things that were done and suffered on earth, with the praises of him that redeemed them by his blood, and made them Kings and Priests to God: Herein he hath sometime a sweet foretast of the everlasting pleasures, which though it be but little, as <hi>Jonathans</hi> honey on the end of his rod, or as the clusters of grapes which were brought from <hi>Canaan</hi> into the wilderness, yet are they more excellent then all the delights of sinners. And in the behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this celestial Glory, some beams do penetrate his breast, and so irradiate his longing soul, that he is <hi>changed thereby</hi> into the <hi>same image from Glory to Glory; the spirit of Glory and of God doth rest upon him;</hi> And O what an excellent holy frame doth this <hi>converse with God</hi> possess his soul of! How reverent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:59347:144"/>
doth he think of him! what life is there in every Name and Attribute of God which he heareth or thinketh on! The mention of his Power, his Wisdome, his Goodness, his Love, his Holinesse, his Truth, how powerful and how pleasant are they to him! when to those that know him but by the hearing of the ear, all these are but like common names and notions; and even to the weaker sort of Christians, whose Walking with God is more uneven, and low, interrupted by their sins and doubts and fears, this life and glory of a Christian course is lesse perceived.</p>
                           <p>And the sweet <hi>appropriating</hi> and <hi>applying</hi> works of faith, by which the soul can <hi>own his God,</hi> and finds it self <hi>owned by him,</hi> are exercised most easily and happily in these near ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches unto God. Our doubts are cherished by our dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and that is much caused by our distance: The nearer the soul doth approach to God, the more distinctly it heareth the voice of mercy, the sweet reconciling invitations of Love; and the more clearly it discerneth that <hi>goodness</hi> and <hi>amiableness</hi> in God, which maketh it easier to us to believe that he loveth us, or is ready to embrace us; and banisheth all those false and horrid apprehensions of him, which before were our discouragement, and made him seem to us more terrible then amiable. As the Ministers and faithful servants of Christ, are ordinarily so misrepresented by the malignant Devil, to those that know them not, that they are ready to think them some silly fools, or falsehearted hypocrites, and to shun them as strange undesirable persons; but when they come to through acquaintance with them by a nearer and familiar converse, they see how much they were mistaken, and wronged by their prejudice and belief of slanderers mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reports: Even so a weak believer that is under troubles, in the apprehension of his sin and danger, is apt to hearken to the enemy of God, that would shew him nothing but his wrath, and represent God as an enemy to him: And in this case it is exceeding hard for a poor sinner to believe that God is reconciled to him, or loveth him, or intends him good, but he is ready to dread and shun him as an enemy, or as he would fly from a wild beast or murderer, or from fire or water that would destroy him: And all these injurious thoughts of God
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:59347:145"/>
are cherished by strangeness and disacquaintance. But as the soul doth fall into an understanding and serious converse with God, and having been often with him, doth find him more merciful than he was by Satan represented to him, his expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience reconcileth his mind to God, and maketh it much easier to him to believe that God is reconciled <hi>unto him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                              </hi> when he hath found much better entertainment with God than he expected, and hath observed his benignity, and the treasures of his bounty laid up in Christ, and by him distributed to believers, and hath found him ready to hear and help, and found him the only full and suitable felicitating Good, this banisheth his former horrid thoughts, and maketh him asham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that ever he should think so suspiciously, injuriously and dshonourably of his dearest God and Father.</p>
                           <p>Yet I must confesse that there are many upright troubled souls, that are much in reading, prayer and meditation, that still find it hard to be perswaded of the Love of God, and that have much more disquietment and fear since they set themselves to think of God, than they had before: But yet for all this, we may well conclude, that to <hi>walk with God,</hi> is the way to <hi>consolation,</hi> and tendeth to acquaint us with his <hi>love.</hi> As for those troubled souls whose experience is objected against this, some of them are such as are yet but in their <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to God,</hi> from a life of former sin and misery, and are yet but like the <hi>needle</hi> in the compasse that is <hi>shaken,</hi> in a <hi>trembling motion</hi> towards their <hi>rest,</hi> and not in any <hi>setled ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions</hi> of it. Some of them by the straying of their ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination too high, and putting themselves upon more than their heads can bear, and by the violence of fears or other passions, do make themselves uncapable of those sweet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solations which else they might find in their converse with God; as a Lute when the strings are broken with straining, is uncapable of making any melody. All of them have false apprehensions of God, and therefore trouble themselves by <hi>their own mistakes.</hi> And if some perplex themselves by their <hi>errour,</hi> doth it follow that therefore the <hi>Truth</hi> is not <hi>comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able?</hi> Is not a Fathers presence consolatory, because some children are afraid of their Fathers, that know them not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of some disguise? And some of Gods children walk so
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:59347:145"/>
unevenly and carelesly before him, that their sins provoke him to hide his face, and to seem to reject them and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own them, and so to trouble them that he may bring them home: But shall the comforts of our Fathers Love and Family, be judged of by the fears or smart of those whom he is scourging for their disobedience, or their tryal? Seek God with understanding, as knowing his essential properties, and what he will be to them that sincerely and diligently seek him, and then you will quickly have experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that nothing so much tendeth to quiet, and settle a doubting, troubled, unstable soul, as <hi>faithfully to walk with God.</hi>

                           <p>But the soul that estrangeth it self from God, may indeed for a time have the <hi>quietness</hi> of <hi>security;</hi> but (so far) it will be strange to the <hi>assurance</hi> of his <hi>Love,</hi> and to <hi>true consolation.</hi> Expect not that God should follow you with his comforts in your sinfulnesse and negligence, and cast them into your hearts whilest you neither seek nor mind them, or that he give you the fruit of <hi>his</hi> wayes in <hi>your own</hi> wayes. Will he be your <hi>joy</hi> when you <hi>forget him?</hi> will he <hi>delight your souls</hi> with his <hi>goodness</hi> and <hi>amiableness,</hi> while you are taken up with other matters, and think not of him? can you expect to find the <hi>comforts</hi> of his <hi>family,</hi> among his <hi>enemies,</hi> out of <hi>doors?</hi> The experience of all the world can tell you, that <hi>prodigals</hi> while they are stragling from their Fathers house, do never tast the <hi>comfort</hi> of his <hi>embraces;</hi> The <hi>strangers meddle not</hi> with his childrens <hi>joyes:</hi> They grow not in the way of ambition, covetousnesse, vainglory, or sensuality; but in the way of holy obedience, and of believing contemplations of the Divine everlasting objects of delight. <hi>For, lo, they that are far from him shall perish: he destroyeth them that go a whoring from him: but it is good for us to draw nigh to God,</hi> Psal. 73. 27, 28.</p>

                           <p>III. <hi>VVAlking with God,</hi> is the <hi>only course that can prove and make men truly wise.</hi> It <hi>proves</hi> them <hi>wise</hi> that make so <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>good</hi> a choice, and are <hi>disposed</hi> and <hi>skilled</hi> in any measure for so high a work. <hi>Practical Wisdome</hi> is the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid, useful, profitable wisdome: And Practical Wisdome is seen in our <hi>Choice</hi> of <hi>Good,</hi> and <hi>Refusal</hi> of <hi>Evil,</hi> as its most immediate and excellent effect. And no <hi>Choosing</hi> or <hi>Refusing</hi> doth shew the <hi>Wisdome</hi> or <hi>Folly</hi> of man so much as that which is about the <hi>Greatest matters,</hi> and which everlasting life or death depends on. He is not thought so wise among men that can write a Volume about the Orthography or Etymology of a word, or that can guess what wood the Trojane Horse was made of, or that can make a chain to tye a Flea in, as he that can bring home Gold and Pearls, or he that can obtain and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage Governments, or he that can cure mortal maladies: For as in <hi>lading</hi> we difference <hi>Bulk</hi> and <hi>Value,</hi> and take not that for the <hi>best commodity</hi> which is of <hi>greatest quantity</hi> or <hi>weight,</hi> but that which in most <hi>precious</hi> and of <hi>greatest use:</hi> so there is a <hi>bulky knowledge, extended far,</hi> to a multitude of <hi>words</hi> and <hi>things,</hi> which are all of no great <hi>use</hi> or <hi>value;</hi> and therefore the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of them is such as <hi>they:</hi> And there is a <hi>precious</hi> sort of <hi>Knowledge,</hi> which fixeth upon the most precious things; which being of greatest <hi>Use</hi> and <hi>Value,</hi> do accordingly prove the <hi>Knowledge</hi> such. Nothing will prove a man simply and properly <hi>wise,</hi> but that which will prove or make him <hi>Happy.</hi> He is <hi>wise indeed,</hi> that is <hi>wise</hi> to his own and others <hi>good:</hi> And that is indeed his <hi>Good,</hi> which saveth his soul, and maketh him for ever blessed. Though we may admire the <hi>Cunning</hi> of those that can make the most curious engines, or by deceiving others advance themselves, or that can subtilly dispute the most curious niceties, or criticize up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the words of several languages; yet I will never call them <hi>Wise,</hi> that are all that while the Devils slaves, the enemies of God, the refusers of Grace, and are making haste to endless misery: And I think there is not one of those in Hell who were once the subtile men on earth, that now take themselves to <hi>have been truly wise,</hi> or glory much in the remembrance of such <hi>Wisdome.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="255" facs="tcp:59347:146"/>And as this <hi>Choice</hi> doth <hi>prove</hi> men <hi>wise,</hi> so the practice of this <hi>Holy walking with God,</hi> doth <hi>make</hi> them much wiser than they were. As there must be some work of the <hi>Spirit</hi> to draw men to <hi>believe in Christ,</hi> and yet the <hi>Spirit</hi> is promised and given (in a special sort or measure) to them that do <hi>Believe;</hi> so must there be <hi>some special Wisdome</hi> to make men <hi>Choose</hi> to <hi>walk with God;</hi> but much more is given to them <hi>in this holy course.</hi> As <hi>Solomon</hi> was wiser than most of the world, <hi>before</hi> he <hi>asked wisdome of God,</hi> or else he would not have made <hi>so wise a Choice,</hi> and preferred <hi>wisdome</hi> before the riches and honours of the world: And yet it was a more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Degree of wisdome that was afterwards given him in answer to his prayer: so it is in this case.</p>
                           <p>There are many undenyable Evidences to prove, that <hi>walking with God</hi> doth do more to <hi>make</hi> men <hi>truly wise,</hi> than all other learning or policy in the world.</p>
                           <p>1. He that <hi>walketh with God,</hi> doth <hi>begin aright,</hi> and settle upon a <hi>sure foundation:</hi> (And we use to say, that a work is half finished that is well begun:) He hath engaged himself to the <hi>best</hi> and <hi>wisest Teacher:</hi> He is a Disciple to <hi>Him that knoweth all things.</hi> He hath taken in infallible principles, and taken them in their proper place and order: He hath learnt those Truths which will every one become a <hi>Teacher</hi> to him, and help him to that which is <hi>yet unlearnt.</hi> Whereas many that thought they were Doctors in <hi>Israel,</hi> if ever they they will be wise and happy, must <hi>become fools</hi> (that is, <hi>such as they have esteemed fools) if ever they will be wise,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 18. and must be called back with <hi>Nicodemus</hi> to learn Christs Cross, and to be taught that <hi>that which is born of the flesh is but flesh,</hi> and <hi>that which is born of the spirit is spirit:</hi> and that therefore they <hi>must be born again</hi> (not only of <hi>water,</hi> but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so of the <hi>spirit</hi>) if ever they <hi>will enter into the Kingdome of Heaven,</hi> Joh. 3. 3, 5, 6. O miserable beginning! and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable progress! when men that never soundly learnt the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries of Regeneration, and Faith, and Love, and Self-denyal, and Mortification, do proceed to study names and words, and to turn over a multitude of Books, to fill their brains with airy notions, and their Common-places with such sayings as may be provision and furniture for their pride and ostentation,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:59347:147"/>
and ornament to their style and language; and know not yet what they must do to be saved, and indeed know nothing as they ought to know! 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 2. As every Science hath its principles, which are supposed in all the consequential veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; so hath Religion as Doctrinal and Practical, those <hi>Truths</hi> which must be <hi>first received</hi> before any other can be received as it ought; and those <hi>things</hi> which must be <hi>first done,</hi> before any other can be done so as to attain their ends. And these <hi>Truths</hi> and <hi>Duties</hi> are principally about God himself, and are <hi>known</hi> and <hi>done</hi> effectually by those, and only those, that <hi>walk with God,</hi> or are devoted to him. It is a lamentable thing to see men immerst in serious studies, even till they grow aged, and to hear them seriously disputing and discoursing about the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies or difficulties in Theology, or inferiour Sciences, before ever they had any saving knowledge of God, or of the work of the Holy Ghost in the converting and sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of the soul, or how to escape everlasting misery!</p>
                           <p>2. He that <hi>walketh with God,</hi> hath fixed upon a <hi>right end,</hi> and is renewing his <hi>estimation</hi> and <hi>intention</hi> of it, and daily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuting it: And this is the first and greatest part of Practical Wisdome. When a man once knoweth his <hi>End</hi> aright, he may the better judge of the aptitude and seasonableness of all the means. When we know once that <hi>Heaven</hi> containeth the only felicity of man, it will direct us to Heavenly cogitations, and to such spiritual means as are fitted to that <hi>End:</hi> If we have the right mark in our eye, we are liker to level at it than if we <hi>mistake</hi> our mark. He is the wise man, and only he, that hath steadily fixed his eye upon that blessedness which he was created and redeemed for, and maketh strait towards it, and bends the powers of soul and body, by faithful constant dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to obtain it. He that hath rightly and resolvedly <hi>deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined of his end,</hi> hath <hi>virtually</hi> resolved a <hi>thousand controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies</hi> that others are unsatisfied and erroneous in: He that is resolved, that <hi>his End is to Please and Glorifie God, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy him for ever,</hi> is easily resolved whether a <hi>holy life,</hi> or a <hi>sensual</hi> and <hi>worldly,</hi> be the way: whether the way be to be <hi>Godly,</hi> or to make a <hi>mock at Godliness:</hi> whether <hi>Covetousness</hi> and <hi>Riches, Ambition</hi> and <hi>Preferment, Voluptuousness</hi> and <hi>Fleshly</hi> pleasures, be the means to attain his <hi>End:</hi> whether it
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:59347:147"/>
will be attained rather by the studying of the Word of God, and meditating on it day and night, and by holy conference, and fervent prayer, and an obedient life; or by negligence, or worldliness, or drunkenness, or gluttony, or cards and dice, or beastly filthiness, or injustice and deceit. Know once but whither it is that we are going, and its easie to know whether the <hi>Saint,</hi> or the <hi>Swine,</hi> or the <hi>Swaggerer</hi> be in the way. But a man that doth <hi>mistake his End,</hi> is out of his way at the first step; and the further he goes, the further he is from true fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity; and the more he erreth, and the further he hath to go back again, if ever he return. Every thing that a man doth in the world, which is not <hi>for the right end</hi> (the <hi>Heavenly fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity</hi>) is an act of <hi>foolishness</hi> and <hi>errour,</hi> how splendid soever the <hi>Matter</hi> or the <hi>Name,</hi> may make it appear to ignorant men. Every word that an ungodly person speaketh being not for a <hi>right End,</hi> is in him but sin and <hi>folly,</hi> however <hi>materially</hi> it may be an excellent and useful Truth. While a miserable soul hath his back upon God, and his face upon the world, every step he goeth is an act of folly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as tending unto his fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther misery. It can be no act of wisdome, which <hi>tendeth</hi> to a mans <hi>damnation.</hi> When such a wretch begins to enquire and bethink him where he is, and whither he is going, and whither he <hi>should</hi> go, and to think of turning back to God, then and never till then, he is beginning to <hi>come to himself,</hi> and to be <hi>wise,</hi> Luk. 15. 17. Till God and Glory be the <hi>End</hi> that he aimeth at, and seriously bends his study, heart and life to seek, though a man were searching into the mysteries of nature, though he were studying or discussing the notions of Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy; though he were admired for his earning and wisdome by the world, and cryed up as the Oracle of the Earth, he is all the while but playing the fool, and going a cleanlier way to Hell than the grosser sinners of the world!

What won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if a thousand such damnable lyes, are believed by the Disciples of the Father of lyes! what wonder if there are so many Saint-haters, and God-haters in the world, as to fill the earth with persecutions and cruelties, or make a scorn of that which God most highly valueth, and all this under pretences of <hi>Order,</hi> or <hi>Unity,</hi> or <hi>Justice,</hi> or something that is <hi>good,</hi> and therefore fit to palliate their sin! Is there any thing so false, or foul, or wicked, that Satan will not teach his followers? Is he grown modest, or moderate, or holy, or just? Is he recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to Christ, to Scripture, to Godliness, or to the Godly? Or is his Kingdom of darkness at an end? and hath he lost the earth? Or are men therefore none of the servants of the Devil, because they were baptized (as <hi>Simon Magus</hi> was) and call and think themselves the servants of Christ? As if still it were not the art by which he gets and keeps Disciples, to suffer them to wear the livery of Christ, and to use his name, that he may thus keep possession of them in peace, who else would be frighted from him, and fly to Christ! He will give them leave to study Arts and Sciences, and to understand things excellent of inferiour use, so be it they will be deceived by him in the matters of God and their salvation. He can al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them to be learned Lawyers, excellent Physicians, Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, Politicians, to be skilful Artists, so be it they will follow him in sin to their damnation, and will overlook the <hi>Truth that should set them free,</hi> (Joh. 8. 32. Yea he will permit them (when
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:59347:149"/>
there's no remedy) to study the holy Scriptures, if he may but be the expounder and applyer of it: Yea he will permit them notionally to understand it, if they will not learn by it to be converted, to be holy, and to be saved: He can suffer them to be <hi>eminent Divines,</hi> so they will <hi>not be serious Christians.</hi> Thus is the world by the grand Deceiver hurried in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to perdition, being taken captive by him at his will, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 26. But the Sanctified are all illuminated by the Holy Ghost, by whom their eyes are so effectually opened, that they <hi>are turned from darkness unto light, and from the power of Satan unto God,</hi> Act. 26. 18. <hi>The Father of Glory hath given them the spirit of wisdom and revelation, in the knowledge of Christ, that the eyes of their understanding being enlightned, they may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the Glory of his inheritance in the Saints,</hi> Eph. 1. 17, 18. Certainly that illumination of the Holy Ghost which is so often mentioned in Scripture as given to all true believers, is not a fansie, nor an insignificant name: And if it signifie any thing, it signifieth somewhat that is much above the teaching of man. All that walk with God <hi>are taught of God!</hi> And can <hi>man</hi> teach like <hi>God?</hi> God hath accesse unto the heart, and there he doth transcribe his Laws, and put them into our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts. And they that walk with him have not only his Word to read, but his <hi>Spirit</hi> to help them to understand it: and being with him, in his family (yea he dwelleth in them and they in him) he is ready at hand to resolve their doubts: when he gave them <hi>his fear,</hi> he gave them the <hi>beginning of wisdom,</hi> Psal. 111. 10. He causeth them to <hi>incline their ear to wisdom,</hi> Prov. 2. 2, 6. and to <hi>apply their hearts unto it,</hi> Psal. 90. 12. <hi>and maketh them to know it in the hidden parts,</hi> Psal. 51. 6.</p>
                           <p>It is his Law that they have determined to make their rule: They live as under his authority: They are more observant of his Will and Government, than of any Laws or Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of man. And as they obey man in and for the Lord, so they do it in subordination to him, and therefore not <hi>against him</hi> and <hi>his Laws,</hi> which being the standard of Justice, and the Rule of Rulers, and of subjects both, they are in the safest way of unerring wisdom, who <hi>walk with God</hi> according to

                              <hi>that Rule<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                              </hi> and refuse to turn aside, though commanded by man, or enticed by Satan, the world, or flesh.</p>
                           <p>5. He that <hi>walketh with God</hi> is the most <hi>considerate</hi> person, and therefore hath great advantage to be wise. The frequent and serious thoughts of God, do awaken all the powers of the soul, so that drowsiness doth not hinder the understanding, and so occasion its deceit: There is scarce a more common and powerful cause of mens folly and delusion and perdition, in all the world, than that <hi>sleepiness</hi> and <hi>stupidity</hi> which hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>Reason</hi> from the <hi>vigorous</hi> performance of its office: In this <hi>sensless case,</hi> though a man both <hi>know</hi> and <hi>consider</hi> of the same Truths, which in their nature are <hi>most powerful</hi> to cleanse and govern and save his soul, yet <hi>sluggishness</hi> doth enervate them: He knoweth them as if he knew them not, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidereth them as if he never thought of them: They work little more upon him, then if he believed them not, or had never heard of them: even as a dream of the greatest matters, moveth not the sleeper from his pillow: In this senslesse state, the Devil can do almost any thing with a sinner: He can make him sin against his knowledge: And when Conscience hath frighted him into some kind of Penitence, and made him cry out, I have sinned and done foolishly, and caused him to promise to do so no more; yet doth the Devil prevail with him to go on, and to break his promises, as if he had never been convinced of his sins, or confessed them, or seen any reason or necessity to amend: He doth but imprison the truth in unrighteousness, and bury it in a senseless heart: whereas if you could but <hi>awaken</hi> all the powers of his soul, to give this <hi>same truth</hi> its due entertainment, and take it deeper into his heart, it would make him even scorn the baits of sin, and see that the ungodly are beside themselves, and make him presently resolve and set upon a holy life. And hence it is that <hi>sickness</hi> which causeth men to receive the <hi>sentence of death,</hi> doth usually make men bewail their former sinful lives<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and marvail that they could be before so sottish as to resist such known and weighty truths; and it makes them purpose and promise reformation and wish themselves in the case of those that they were wont before to deride and scorn: Because now the Truth is deeplier received and digested, by their
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:59347:150"/>
awakened souls, and appeareth in its proper evidence and strength. There is no man but must acknowledge, that the same truth doth at one time command his soul, which at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time seems of little force: It is a wonder to observe how differently the <hi>same consideration</hi> worketh with a man when he is <hi>awakened,</hi> and when he is in a <hi>secure stupid</hi> case!</p>
                           <p>Now this is his advantage that <hi>walks with God:</hi> He is much more frequently then others <hi>awakened,</hi> to a serious appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of the things which he understandeth: The thoughts of the presence of the most Holy God, will not suffer him to be as <hi>secure</hi> and <hi>senseless</hi> as others are, or as he is himself when he turneth aside from this Heavenly conversation. He hath in God such exceeding transcendent excellencies, such Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, such Goodness continually to behold, that it keepeth his soul in a much more <hi>serious lively</hi> state, than any other means could keep it in: so that when ever any <hi>truth</hi> or <hi>duty</hi> is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to him, all his saculties are awake and ready to observe it and improve it. A Sermon, or a good book, or godly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, or a mercy, when a man hath been with God in prayer or contemplation, will relish better with him, and sink much deeper, then at another time. Nay one serious thought of God himself, will do more to make a man truly and solidly wise, then all the reading and learning in the world, which shuts him out.</p>
                           <p>6. <hi>Walking with God</hi> doth <hi>fix the mind,</hi> and keep it from <hi>diversions</hi> and <hi>vagaries,</hi> and consequently much helpeth to make men wise. A <hi>stragling</hi> mind is empty and unfurnished. He that hath no <hi>dwelling,</hi> for the most part hath no <hi>wealth. Wandering</hi> is the <hi>beggars</hi> life. Men do but bewilder and lose themselves, and not grow wise, whose thoughts are ranging in the corners of the earth, and are like masterlesse dogs, that run up and down according to their fansie, and may go any whether, but have business nowhere. The creature will not fix the soul: But God is the center of all our cogitations: In <hi>him</hi> only they may <hi>unite</hi> and <hi>fix</hi> and <hi>rest.</hi> He is the only loadstone that can effectually attract and hold it steadfast to himself. Therefore he that <hi>walks with God</hi> is the most <hi>constant and unmoveable</hi> of men: Let prosperity or adversity come; let the world be turned upside-down, and the mountains be
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:59347:151"/>
hurled into the sea, yet he changeth not: Let men <hi>allure</hi> or <hi>threat,</hi> let them <hi>scorn</hi> or <hi>rage,</hi> let laws, and customs, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, and interest change, he is still the same. For he knoweth that God is still the same, and that his Word chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not. Let that be death one year which was the way to reputation another, and let the giddy world turn about as the seasons of the year, this changeth not his mind and life (though in things lawful he is of a yeilding temper:) For he knoweth that the interest of his soul doth not change, with the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours or interests of men: He still feareth <hi>sinning,</hi> for he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that <hi>Judgement</hi> is still drawing on, in all changes and seasons whatsoever: He is still set upon the pleasing of the most Holy God, whoever be uppermost among men; as knowing that the God whom he serveth is able to deliver him from man, but man is not able to deliver him from God. He still goeth on in the Holy path, as knowing that Heaven is as sure and as desirable as ever it was. <hi>Psal.</hi> 112. 6, 7. <hi>Surely he shall not be moved for ever: the Righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance: He shall not be afraid of evil tydings: His heart is fixed trusting in the Lord: His heart is established, he shall not be afraid.</hi>]</p>
                           <p>7. He that <hi>walketh with God,</hi> hath the <hi>great master-truths upon his heart,</hi> which are the <hi>standard</hi> of the rest, and the <hi>stock,</hi> as it were, out of which they <hi>spring.</hi> The <hi>great truths</hi> about <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Glory,</hi> have a greater power then many hundred truths of an inferiour nature. And moreover, such a one is sure that he shall be wise in the <hi>greatest</hi> and most <hi>necessary</hi> points. He is guilty of no ignorance or errour that shall keep him out of <hi>heaven,</hi> or hinder his acceptance with his God. And if he be wise enough to please God and to be saved, he is wise indeed: (as before was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>

                           <p>8. <hi>Walking with God</hi> doth <hi>take off the vizar of deluding things,</hi> and <hi>keepeth us out of the reach and power of those objects and arguments which are the instruments of deceit.</hi> When a man hath been believingly and seriously with God, how easily can he see through the sophistry of the tempting world! How easily can he practically consute the reasonings of the flesh! and discern the dotage of the seeming subtilties of wicked men, that will needs think they have <hi>reason</hi> for that which
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:59347:151"/>
is displeasing to their Maker, and tends to the damning of their souls! so far as a man is conversant with God, so far he is sensible, that all things are nothing, which can be offered as a price to hire him to sin: and that the name of preferment, and honour and wealth, or of disgrace and imprisonment and death, are words almost of no signification, as to the tempters ends, to draw the soul from God and duty. It is men that know not God, and know not what it is to <hi>walk with him,</hi> that think these words so big and powerful, to whom <hi>wealth</hi> and <hi>honour</hi> signifie more then <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Heaven;</hi> and <hi>poverty, disgrace</hi> and <hi>death,</hi> do signifie more then <hi>Gods displeasure</hi> and <hi>everlasting punishment in hell.</hi> As it is easie to cheat a man that is <hi>far from the light,</hi> so is it easie to deceive the learnedst man that is <hi>far from God.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>9. <hi>Walking with God,</hi> doth <hi>greatly help us against the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulness and erroneous disposition of our own hearts.</hi> The <hi>will</hi> hath a very great power upon the <hi>understanding:</hi> And therefore ungodly fleshly men will very hardly receive any truth which crosseth the carnal interest or disposition: And will hardly let go any errour that feedeth them: because their corrupted wills are a byas to their understandings, and make them desperately partial in all their reading and hearing, and hypocritical in their prayers and enquiries after truth. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest and corruption locketh up their hearts from their own observation. Whereas a man that <hi>walketh with God,</hi> that is jealous and holy and just and a searcher of the heart, is driven from hypocrisie, and forced to behave himself as in the open light, and to do all as in the sight of all the world, as knowing that the sight of God is of far greater concernment and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard. The partiality, corruption and byas of the heart, is detected and shamed by the presence of God. Therefore to <hi>walk with God</hi> is to <hi>walk in the light,</hi> and <hi>as children of the light,</hi> and not in darkness. And he that doth <hi>Truth cometh to the light, that his deeds might be manifest, that they are wrought in God: when every one that doth evil hateth the light; neither cometh to the light lest his deeds should be reproved: And this is their condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men love the darkness rather then the light, because their deeds are evil,</hi> Joh. 3. 19, 20, 21. It tendeth therefore exceedingly
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:59347:152"/>
to make men <hi>wise,</hi> to <hi>Walk with God,</hi> because it is a <hi>walking in the light,</hi> and in such a <hi>presence</hi> as most powerfully prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth against that hypocrisie, deceitfulness and partiality of the heart, which is the common cause of damning errour.</p>
                           <p>10. Lastly, they that <hi>walk with God</hi> are entitled by many <hi>promises,</hi> to the <hi>guidance</hi> and <hi>direction of his spirit.</hi> And blessed are those that have such a guide: at once a <hi>light in the world</hi> without them, and a <hi>light</hi> immediately from God <hi>within</hi> them: For so far as he is received and worketh in them, he will lead them into truth, and save them from deceit and folly; and having <hi>guided them by his counsel, will afterward take them unto glory,</hi> Psal. 73. 24. Whereas the ungodly are <hi>led by the flesh,</hi> and often <hi>given up to their own hearts lusts, to walk in their own counsels,</hi> Rom. 8. 1, 13. Psal. 81. 12. till at last the <hi>fools do say in their hearts, there is no God,</hi> Psal. 14. 1. <hi>and they become corrupt and abhominable, eating up the people of the Lord as bread, and call not on his Name,</hi> ver. 2. &amp;c. <hi>Deceiving and being deceived: sensual, having not the spirit,</hi> Jud. 19. <hi>who shall receive the reward of their unrighteousness, as accounting it pleasure to riot in the day time,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 13.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div n="4" type="part">
                           <p>IV. ANother benefit of <hi>Walking with God,</hi> is, that it <hi>maketh men good, as well as wise:</hi> It is the most excellent means for the advancement of mans soul to the <hi>highest degree of holiness attainable</hi> in this life. If conversing with <hi>Good men</hi> doth powerfully tend to make men <hi>good;</hi> conversing with <hi>God</hi> must needs be more effectual; which may appear in these particulars.</p>
                           <p>1. The apprehensions of the <hi>presence</hi> and <hi>attributes</hi> of God, do most effectually <hi>check the stirrings</hi> of corruption, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke all the vicious inclinations and motions of the soul: even the most <hi>secret sin</hi> of the <hi>heart,</hi> is rebuked by his <hi>presence,</hi> as well as the most open transgression of the life: For the thoughts of the heart are open to his view. All what is done before God, is done as in the open light: nothing of it can be hid: no sin can have the encouragement of secresie to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolden it. It is all committed in the presence of the Universal King and Lawgiver of the world, who hath forbidden it: It
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:59347:152"/>
is done before him that most abhorreth it, and will never be reconciled to it. It is done before him that is the Judge of the world, and will shortly pass the sentence on us according to what we have done in the body. It standeth up in his presence who is of infinite Majesty and perfection, and therefore most to be reverenced and honoured; And therefore if the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of a wise and grave and venerable person, will restrain men from sin, the presence of God apprehended seriously, will do it much more. It is committed before him that is our dearest friend, and tender Father, and chiefest benefactor: And therefore ingenuity, gratitude and love, will all rise up against it in those that <hi>walk with God.</hi> There is that in God, before the eyes of those that <hi>walk with him,</hi> which is most <hi>contrary to sin,</hi> and most <hi>powerful</hi> against it, of any thing in the world. Every one will confess that if mens eyes were opened to see the Lord in Glory standing over them, it would be the most powerful means to restrain them from transgressing: The drunkard would not then venture upon his cups: the fornicator would have a cooling for his lusts: the swearer would be afraid to take his Makers name in vain: the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane would scarce presume to scorn or persecute a holy life. And he that <hi>walketh with God,</hi> though he see him not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreally, yet seeth him by faith, and liveth as in his presence; and therefore must needs be restrained from sin, as having the means which is next to the sight of God. If pride should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to stir in one that <hi>walks with God,</hi> O what a powerful remedy is at hand! How effectually would the presence of the Great and Holy God rebuke it! and constrain us to say as <hi>Job</hi> 42. 5, 6. <hi>I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye seeth thee: wherefore I abhor my self and repent in dust and ashes.</hi>] If worldly love or carnal lust should stir <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>n such a one, how powerfully would the terrours of the Lord repress it? and his Majesty rebuke it? and his Love and Goodness overcome it? If worldly cares or murmuring dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents begin to trouble such a one, how effectually will the Goodness, the All sufficiency and the faithfulness of God allay them, and quiet and satisfie the soul, and cause it to be offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at its own offence, and to chide it self for its repinings and distrust? If <hi>Passion</hi> arise and begin to discompose us, how
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:59347:153"/>
powerfully will the presence of God rebuke it? and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence of his Majesty, and the sense of his Authority and pardoning grace will asswage it, and shame us into silent quietness; who dare let out his passions upon man, in the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of his Maker,</hi> that <hi>apprehendeth</hi> his presence? The same I might say of all other sins.</p>
                           <p>2. The <hi>presence</hi> and <hi>attributes of God</hi> apprehended by those that <hi>walk with him,</hi> is the <hi>potent remedy against Temptations.</hi> Who will once turn an eye to the gold and glory of the world that is offered him to allure him to sin, if he see God stand by? who would be tempted to lust or any sinful pleasure, if he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the presence of the Lord? Satan can never come in so ill a time with his temptations, and have so little hope to speed, as when the soul is contemplating the attributes of God, or taken up in prayer with him, or any way apprehensive of his presence. The soul that faithfully walks with God, hath enough at hand in him to answer all temptations. And the further any man is from God, and the less he knoweth him, the more Temptations can do upon him.</p>
                           <p>3. The presence of God, affordeth the most <hi>powerful mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives unto Good,</hi> to those that <hi>walk with him.</hi> There is no grace in man, but what is from God, and may find in God its proper object or incentive. As <hi>God is God,</hi> above the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture transcendently and infinitely in all perfections, so all the <hi>motives</hi> to <hi>goodness</hi> which are fetcht from <hi>him,</hi> are transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently above all that may be fetcht from any creature. He that liveth alwaies by the fire or in the Sun-shine, is likest to be warm. He that is most with God, will be most like to God in Holiness. Frequent and serious converse with him, doth most <hi>deeply</hi> imprint his communicable attributes on the heart, and make there the clearest impression of his image. Believers have learned by their own experience, that one hours serious prayer, or meditation, in which they can get nigh to God in the Spirit, doth more advance their grace, then any help that the creature can afford them.</p>
                           <p>4. Moreover those that <hi>walk with God,</hi> have not only a <hi>Powerful,</hi> but an <hi>universal incentive for the actuating and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing of every grace.</hi> Knowledge, and faith, and fear, and love, and trust, and hope, and obedience, and zeal, and all
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:59347:153"/>
have <hi>in God</hi> their <hi>proper objects</hi> and <hi>incentives: One Creature</hi> may be useful to us in <hi>one thing,</hi> and <hi>another</hi> in <hi>another thing;</hi> but <hi>God</hi> is the most effectual mover of <hi>all</hi> his graces: and that in a holy harmony and order. Indeed <hi>he hath no greater</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to draw us to Love him, and Fear him, and Trust him, and Obey him, than <hi>himself. It is life eternal to know him in his Son,</hi> Joh. 17. 3. And that is, not only because it entitleth us to life eternal, but also because it is the <hi>beginning</hi> and <hi>incentive</hi> of that life of holiness which will be eternal.</p>
                           <p>5. Moreover, those that walk with God, have a <hi>constant</hi> as well as a <hi>Powerful</hi> and <hi>Universal</hi> incentive to exercise and encrease their Graces. Othet helps may be out of the way: Their <hi>Preachers</hi> may be silenced or removed: Their <hi>Friends</hi> may be scattered or taken from them: Their <hi>Books</hi> may be forbidden, or not at hand: But <hi>God</hi> is alwaies ready and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: They have leave at all times to come to him, and be welcome. Whenever they are willing they may go to him by prayer or contemplation, and find all in him which they can desire. If they want not <hi>Hearts,</hi> they shall find no want of any thing in <hi>God.</hi> At what time soever fear would tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment them, they may draw near and <hi>put their trust in him,</hi> Psal. 56. 2, 3, 4. &amp; 11. 1. &amp; 18. 2, 30. &amp; 31. 1, 6. He will be a <hi>sure and speedy refuge</hi> for them, a <hi>very present help in trouble,</hi> Psal. 46. 1. &amp; 62. 7, 8. &amp; 91. 2, 9 &amp; 94. 22. Whenever cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness or lukewarmness would extinguish the work of Grace, they may go to him, and find those streams of flaming Love flow from him, those strong attractives, those wonderful mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, those terrible judgements, of which while they are mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, the fire may again wax hot within them, <hi>Psal.</hi> 39. 3.</p>
                           <p>6. Lastly, by way of <hi>encouraging reward,</hi> God useth to <hi>give</hi> abundantly of his Grace, to those that <hi>walk</hi> most faithfully with him: He will shew most Love to those that most love him: He will be nearest to them that most desirously draw nigh to him; while he forsaketh those that forsake him, and turneth away from those that turn away from him, 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 15. 2. <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 32. <hi>Ezr.</hi> 8. 22. [<hi>The hand of our God is for good upon all them that seek him: but his power and his wrath is against all them that forsake him.</hi>]</p>
                           <p>Thus it is apparent in all those evidences, that <hi>walking with
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:59347:154"/>
God,</hi> is not only a <hi>discovery</hi> of the Goodness that men have, but the only way to encrease their Grace, and make them bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. O what a sweet humility and seriousness, and spirituality appeareth in the conference, or conversation, or both, of those that newly come from a believing close converse with God! When they that come from <hi>men</hi> and <hi>Books,</hi> may have but a common mind or life! And those that come from the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and pleasure of the world and flesh, and from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of foolish riotous gallants, may come defiled, as the Swine out of the mire!</p>
                        </div>
                        <div n="5" type="part">
                           <p>V. LAstly, <hi>to walk with God, is the best preparation for times of suffering, and for the day of death.</hi> As we must <hi>be judged</hi> according to what we have done in the body; so the nearer we find our selves to judgement, the more we shall be constrained to <hi>judge our selves</hi> according to what we have done, and shall the more perceive the effects upon our souls.</p>
                           <p>That this is so excellent a preparative for <hi>sufferings</hi> and <hi>death,</hi> will appear by the consideration of these particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
                           <p>1. They that <hi>walk with God</hi> are <hi>safest from all destructive</hi> sufferings; and shall have none but what are sanctified to their good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28. They are near to God, where destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction cometh not; as the Chicken under the wings of the Hen. They <hi>walk with him</hi> that will not lead them to perdition: that will not neglect them, nor sell them for nought, nor expose them to the will of men and devils, though he may suffer them to be tryed for their good. No one can take them out of his hands. Be near to him, and you are safe: The destroyer can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fetch you thence. He can fetch you (when the time is come) from the side of your merriest companions, and dearest friends; from the presence of the greatest Princes; from the strongest Tower, or most sumptuous Pallace, or from your heaps of riches, in your securest health: But he cannot take you from the arms of Christ, nor from under the wings of your Creatours love. [<hi>For there is no God like him, in Heaven above, or on the earth beneath, who keepeth Covenant and Mercy with his
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:59347:154"/>
servants, that walk before him with all their heart,</hi> 1 King. 8 23.] 1 King. 11. 38. However we are used <hi>in our Fathers presence,</hi> we are sure it shall be for good in the latter end: For he wanteth neither <hi>Power</hi> nor <hi>Love</hi> to deliver us, if he saw de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance to be best.</p>
                           <p>2. <hi>Walking with God</hi> is the surest way to <hi>obtain a certainty of his special love,</hi> and of our <hi>salvation:</hi> And what an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent preparative for sufferings or death such assurance is, I need not tell any considerate beleever. How easie may it be to us to suffer poverty, disgrace or wrongs, or the pains of sickness or death, when once we are certain that we shall not suffer the pains of Hell! How chearfully may we go out of this troublesome world, and leave the greatest prosperity behind us, when we are sure to live in Heaven for ever! Even an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidel will say, that he could suffer or dye, if he could but be certain to be Glorified in Heaven when he is dead.</p>
                           <p>3. <hi>Walking with God</hi> doth <hi>mortifie the flesh,</hi> and allay the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and lusts thereof: The soul that is taken up with higher matters, and daily seeth things more excellent, becometh as dead to the things below: And thus it weaneth us from all that is in the world which seemeth most desirable to carnal men. And when the <hi>flesh is mortified,</hi> and the <hi>world is nothing</hi> to us, or but as a dead and loathsome carkass, what is there left to be <hi>very troublesome</hi> in any <hi>suffering</hi> from the world? or to make us loth by death to leave it? It is men that <hi>know not God,</hi> that overvalue the profits and honours of the world; and men that never felt the comforts of Communion with God, that set too much by the pleasures of the flesh: And it is men that <hi>set too much by</hi> these, that make so great a matter of suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering. It is he that basely <hi>overvalueth wealth,</hi> that whineth and repineth when he comes to <hi>poverty:</hi> It is he that set too much by his <hi>honour,</hi> and being befooled by his pride, doth greatly esteem the thoughts or applauding words of men, that swelleth against those that <hi>disesteem him,</hi> and breaketh his heart when he falleth into <hi>disgrace.</hi> He that is cheated out of his wits by the pomps and splendour of a high and prosperous estate, doth think he is <hi>undone</hi> when he is brought low. But it is not so with him that <hi>walks with God:</hi> For being taken up with far higher things, he knoweth the vanity of these: As
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:59347:155"/>
he seeth not in them any thing that is worthy of his <hi>strong de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,</hi> so neither any thing that is worthy of <hi>much lamentation</hi> when they are gone. He never thought that a shadow or fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or a blast of wind could make him happy: And he cannot think that the <hi>loss</hi> of these can make him miserable. He that is taken up with God, hath a higher interest and business, and findeth not himself so <hi>much concerned</hi> in the storms or calms that are here below, as others are, who know no better, and never minded higher things.</p>
                           <p>4. <hi>Walking with God doth much overcome the fear of man:</hi> The fear of him that can destroy both soul and body in Hell fire, will extinguish the fear of them that can but kill the body, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 4. The threats or frowns of a worm are inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to him that daily walketh with the great and dreadful God, and hath his power and word for his security. As <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses esteemed the reproach of Christ greater riches than the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of</hi> Egypt, <hi>because he had respect to the recompence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; so he feared not the wrath of the King, for he endured as seeing him that is invisible,</hi> Heb. 11. 27.</p>
                           <p>5. <hi>Walking with God</hi> doth much <hi>prepare for sufferings and death,</hi> in that it <hi>breedeth quietness in the conscience:</hi> so that when all is at <hi>peace within,</hi> it will be <hi>easie to suffer</hi> any thing from without. Though there is no proper merit in our works to comfort us, yet it is an unspeakable consolation to a slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered persecuted man to be able to say<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                              <hi>These evil sayings are spoken falsly of me, for the sake of Christ: and I suffer not as an evil doer, but as a Christian:</hi> And it is matter of very great peace to a man that is hasting unto death, to be able to say as <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 20. 3.

                           <p>Nay if you have not walked with God in the spirit, but walked after the flesh, though your <hi>repentance</hi> should be <hi>sound</hi> and <hi>true</hi> at the last, it will yet very hardly serve to <hi>comfort you,</hi> though it may serve to your <hi>salvation:</hi> because you will very hardly get any assurance that it is <hi>sincere.</hi> It is dangerous lest it should prove but the effect of fear (which will not save) when it cometh not till death do fright you to it.

                           <p>6. Moreover, to <hi>walk with God</hi> is an <hi>excellent preparation for sufferings and death,</hi> because it tendeth to <hi>acquaint the soul with God,</hi> and to embolden it both to go to him in <hi>Prayer,</hi> and to <hi>Trust</hi> on him, and expect <hi>salvation</hi> from him. He that <hi>walketh with God</hi> is <hi>so much used to holy Prayer,</hi> that he is a <hi>man of Prayer,</hi> and is skilled in it, and hath tryed what prayer can do with God: so that in the hour of his extremity, he is not to seek, either for a <hi>God to pray to.</hi> or a <hi>Mediator</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercede for him, or a <hi>Spirit of Adoption</hi> to enable him as a child to fly for help to his <hi>reconciled Father.</hi> And having not only been frequently <hi>with God,</hi> but frequently <hi>entertained</hi> and <hi>accepted</hi> by him, and had his prayers <hi>heard</hi> and <hi>granted,</hi> it is a great encouragement to an afflicted soul in the hour of distresse, to go to such a God for help. And it is a dreadful thing when a soul is ready to go out of the world, to have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

that communion with him in the way of Grace, which is the way to communion in Glory, O what a terrible thought is this! But how comfortable is it when the soul can say [<hi>I know whom I have believed? The God that afflicteth me is he that loveth me, and hath manifested his love to me by his daily at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive, assisting and accepting Grace!</hi> I am going by death to see him intuitively, whom I have often seen by the eye of Faith, and to live with him in Heaven, with whom I lived here on earth; <hi>From</hi> whom, and <hi>Through</hi> whom, and <hi>To</hi> whom was my life! I go not to any enemy, nor an utter stranger, but to that God who was the Spring, the Ruler, the Guide, the Strength and the Comfort of my life. He hath heard me so oft, that I cannot think he will now reject me: He hath so often comforted my soul, that I will not believe he will now thrust me into Hell: He hath mercifully received me so oft, that I cannot believe he will now refuse me: Those that come to him in the way of Grace, I have found he will in no wise cast out.] As <hi>strangeness to God</hi> doth fill the soul with <hi>distrustful fears,</hi> so <hi>walking with him</hi> doth breed that humble <hi>confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> which is a wonderful comfort in the hour of distress, and a happy preparations to sufferings and death.</p>
                           <p>7. Lastly, to <hi>walk with God,</hi> doth encrease that <hi>Love of God</hi> in the soul, which is the <hi>heavenly tincture,</hi> and inclineth it to lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

To <hi>love</hi> the state and place that we are going to, being made <hi>connatural</hi> and <hi>suitable</hi> thereto, will much overcome the fears of death. But for a soul that is acquainted with nothing but this life, and favoureth nothing but <hi>Earth</hi> and <hi>Flesh,</hi> and hath no connaturality with the things above, for such a soul to be surprized with the tydings of death, alas, how dreadful must it be!</p>

house and land, and life, and all things must <hi>be forsaken for Christ,</hi> if we will be <hi>his Disciples? These</hi> are the <hi>things behind us,</hi> which we turned our back on when we consented to the Covenant; and are they now grown better? or is God grown worse, that we turn our hearts from him to them? when we first begun our Christian race, it was upon supposition that it was for that immortal Crown, which all the world is not to be compared to: And have we not still the same consideration before us, to move us to hold on till we attain it?

Have you not perceived that this is the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign</hi> and <hi>meaning</hi> of his <hi>afflicting</hi> and <hi>disappointing</hi> providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? even to leave you no comfortable entertainment or converse but with himself, and with his servants, and with those means that lead you to himself? If you begin to
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:59347:163"/>
desire to lodge abroad in strange habitations, he will <hi>unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> those houses, and will not leave you a <hi>room that's dry</hi> to put your head in; or he will throw open the doors, and leave all open to the lust of ravenous beasts and robbers. He <hi>will have</hi> thy <hi>heart,</hi> and <hi>he will</hi> have thy <hi>company,</hi> because thou art his child, and because he loveth thee. He will allow thee neither thy carnal <hi>Delights</hi> or <hi>Hopes.</hi> If he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive thee either <hi>taking that Pleasure</hi> in thy <hi>Prosperity</hi> which thou shouldest take in him alone, or <hi>Hoping</hi> at least that the <hi>world</hi> may hereafrer prove more <hi>amiable</hi> and <hi>delightful</hi> to thee; the more he <hi>loveth thee,</hi> the more his <hi>Providence</hi> shall conspire with his <hi>Grace,</hi> to change thy mind, by depriving thee of thy unwholsome dangerous <hi>delights,</hi> and of all thy <hi>Hopes</hi> of such hereafter. Use the world as a traveller, for the ends to which it was ordained, to the service of God, and the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance of thy salvation, and then thou shalt find that God will furnish thee with all that is necessary to these necessary ends: But if the world must have your <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Care,</hi> and must be your chiefest <hi>business</hi> and <hi>delight,</hi> and your <hi>excuse</hi> for not attending upon God, murmure not, nor marvel not if he dispose of it and you accordingly. If you are yet <hi>too healthful</hi> to think with <hi>seriousness</hi> on your eternal state; If you are <hi>too Rich</hi> to part with all for Christ, or <hi>openly to own his Cause;</hi> If you are <hi>too much esteemed</hi> in the world to own a scorned slandered Religion; If you are <hi>so busie</hi> for <hi>Earth,</hi> that you cannot have <hi>time</hi> to think of <hi>Heaven;</hi> If you have <hi>so much delight</hi> in <hi>House</hi> or <hi>Land,</hi> or in your <hi>employments,</hi> or <hi>recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> or <hi>friends,</hi> that <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Godliness</hi> can have little or none of your <hi>delight:</hi> Marvel not then if God do <hi>shake</hi> your <hi>Health,</hi> or waste your <hi>Riches,</hi> or turn your <hi>Honour</hi> into <hi>contempt,</hi> and suffer men to slander and reproach you, and spit in your sace, and make you of no reputation: Marvel not if he turn you out of all, or turn all to your grief and trouble, and make the world a desert to you, and the inhabitants as wolves and bears. The great Lesson that Christ hath undertaken to <hi>teach you,</hi> is the difference betwixt the <hi>Creatour</hi> and the Creature, and the difference betwixt <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth.</hi> The great work that Christ hath undertaken to <hi>do upon you,</hi> is to recover your <hi>hearts</hi> from the <hi>world</hi> to <hi>God:</hi> And this Lesson <hi>he will

It is sad that we should be so <hi>foolish</hi> and <hi>unkind,</hi> as to stay from God, as long as any preferments, or pleasures, or profits in the world, will entertain us: But see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is so, let us be thankful both to that <hi>Grace</hi> and that <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> which cureth us. If you perceive it not better to <hi>dwell with God,</hi> than with a <hi>flattering prospering world,</hi> he will try whether you can think it better to <hi>dwell with God,</hi> than with a <hi>malicious, cruel, persecuting world:</hi> And whether it be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to have your <hi>hearts in Heaven,</hi> than in poverty, prison, banishment or reproach. If you find it not better to converse with God, than with those that <hi>honour</hi> you, <hi>please</hi> you, or <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer</hi> you; he will try whether you can think it better to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse</hi> with him, than with those that <hi>hate, revile, belye,</hi> and <hi>persecute</hi> you. And are these the wise and wholsome methods of our great Physician? And shall we not rather be ruled by him, than by our brutish appetites? and think better of his counsels, than of the blind concupiscence of the flesh? Let this be the <hi>issue</hi> of all our sufferings, and all the cruelties and inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the world, to drive us home to <hi>converse with God,</hi> and to turn our <hi>desires,</hi> and <hi>labours,</hi> and <hi>expectations,</hi> to the <hi>true felicity</hi> that never will forsake us; and then, the Will of the Lord be done! Let him choose <hi>his means,</hi> if <hi>this</hi> may be the <hi>end:</hi> Let us kiss the Rod, and not revile it, if <hi>this</hi> may be the fruit of his corrections. Who will not pray that God would deny us those <hi>contents,</hi> which keep us from seeking our <hi>content</hi>
                           <pb n="291" facs="tcp:59347:164"/>
in him? And that he would deny us all those <hi>hurtful pleasures</hi> which hinder us from <hi>pleasing him,</hi> or from making <hi>him</hi> and <hi>his waies</hi> our chiefest pleasure? And that he would permit us no such creature-converse, as hinderth our converse with <hi>him?</hi> It is <hi>best</hi> living there (be it in prison or at liberty) where we may <hi>live best to God.</hi> Come home, O suffering Christian, to thy God! take up thy <hi>Content</hi> and <hi>Rest in him;</hi> be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with him as thy <hi>Portion;</hi> and remember <hi>Where it is</hi> that he is to be <hi>fully</hi> and <hi>perpetually enjoyed;</hi> and then it is good for thee that thou wast afflicted; for all thy sufferings have their end.</p>

                     <bibl>Joh. 16. 32.</bibl>
                     <q>Behold the hour cometh, yea is come, that ye shall be scattered every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: And yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.</q>
                  </epigraph>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving treated of our <hi>Conformity to Christ in sufferings,</hi> in <hi>General,</hi> I since came distinctly to treat of his <hi>particular sufferings</hi> in which we must be <hi>conformed</hi> to him: And having gone over many of those particulars, I am this day to handle the instance of [<hi>Christs being forsaken by his friends and followers.</hi>]</p>
                  <p>He thought meet to <hi>foretell</hi> them how they should manifest their infirmity and untrustiness in this temporary forsaking of him, that so he might fullyer convince them, that he knew what was in man, and that he knew future contingencies, (or things to come which seem most dependent on the will of man) and that he voluntarily submitted to his deserted state, and expected no support from creatures, but that <hi>man</hi> should then do <hi>least for Christ,</hi> when <hi>Christ</hi> was doing <hi>most for man;</hi> that <hi>man</hi> by an unthankful <hi>forsaking Christ,</hi> should then manifest his <hi>forsaken</hi> deplorate state, when Christ was to make atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for his Reconciliation to God, and was preparing the
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:59347:168"/>
most costly remedy for his recovery. He <hi>foretold</hi> them of the fruit which their infirmity would produce, to humble them that were apt to think too highly of themselves for the late free confession they had made of Christ, when they had new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly said [<hi>Now we are sure that thou knowest all things: by this we are sure that thou comest forth from God,</hi> ver. 30]</p>
                  <p>He answereth them [<hi>Do ye now believe? Behold the hour cometh,</hi> &amp;c.] Not that Christ would not have his servants know his graces in them, but he would also have them know the <hi>corruption</hi> that is latent, and the infirmity consistent with their grace. We are very apt to judge of all that <hi>is in us,</hi> and of all that we <hi>shall do</hi> hereafter, by what we <hi>feel at the present</hi> upon our hearts. As when we <hi>feel</hi> the stirring of some <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption</hi> we are apt to think that there is <hi>nothing else,</hi> and hardly perceive the contrary grace, and are apt to think it will never be better with us: so when we <hi>feel</hi> the exercise of <hi>faith, desire</hi> or <hi>love,</hi> we are apt to overlook the contrary <hi>corruptions,</hi> and to think that we shall never feel them more. But Christ would keep us both humble and vigilant, by acquainting us with the mutability and unconstancy of our minds. When it goes well with us, we forget that the time is coming when it may go worse. As Christ said to his Disciples here in the case of <hi>Believing,</hi> we may say to our selves in that and other cases: <hi>Do we now Believe?</hi> It is well: but the time may be coming in which we may be brought to shake with the stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of our remaining unbelief, and shrewdly tempted to question the truth of Christianity it self, and of the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, and of the life to come. <hi>Do we now rejoyce</hi> in the perswasions of the Love of God? The time may be coming when we may think our selves forsaken and undone, and think he will esteem and use us as his enemies. <hi>Do we now pray with ferveur,</hi> and pour out our souls enlargedly to God? It is well: but the time may be coming when we shall seem to be as dumb and prayerless, and say, we cannot pray, or else we find no audience and acceptance of our prayers. Christ knoweth that in us which we little know by our selves; and therefore may <hi>foreknow</hi> that we will commit such sins, or fall into such dangers, as we little <hi>fear.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What Christ here prophesieth to them did afterwards all
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:59347:168"/>
come to pass. As soon as ever danger and trouble did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, they began to flag, and to shew how ill they could adhere unto him or suffer with him, without his special corroborating grace: In the garden when he was sweating blood in prayer they were sleeping; Though the spirit was willing, the flesh was weak: They could not <hi>watch with him one hour,</hi> Matth. 26<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 40, 41. When he was apprehended, they shifted each man for himself, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 56. [<hi>Then all the Disciples forsook him and fled.</hi> And as this is said to be <hi>that the Scriptures might be fulfilled,</hi> Matth. 26. 54, 56. so it <hi>might</hi> be said to be, that <hi>this prediction of Christ himself might be fulfilled.</hi> Not that Scripture Prophesies did <hi>cause the sin</hi> by which they were ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, nor that God caused the sin to fulfill his own predictions, but that God cannot be deceived who foretold in Scriptures long before that thus it would come to pass: when it is said that [<hi>thus it must be that the Scripture may be fulfilled</hi>] the meaning is not, that [<hi>thus God will make it be</hi>] or [<hi>thus he causeth men to do</hi>] that he may fulfill the Scriptures: It is not <hi>necessitas consequentis vel causata</hi> that is inferred from predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; but only <hi>necessitas consequentiae;</hi> a <hi>Logical Necessity in ordine cognoscendi &amp; dicendi;</hi> not a <hi>Natural Necessity in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine essendi:</hi> not a <hi>Necessity</hi> of the <hi>Thing it self</hi> as <hi>caused</hi> by the prediction or decree; but a <hi>necessity</hi> of the <hi>truth</hi> of this <hi>conclusion</hi> in <hi>arguing; [such a thing will be, because God hath decreed, foreknown or foretold it:</hi>] or [<hi>whatever God fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telleth, must necessarily come</hi> to pass; (that is, <hi>will certainly</hi> come to pass: <hi>but this God hath foretold: therefore this will come to pass.</hi>]</p>

                  <p>We are now to consider of this not only as a <hi>part of Christs humiliation,</hi> but also as a <hi>point</hi> in which <hi>we must expect to be conformed to him.</hi> It may possibly seem strange to us that Christ would suffer <hi>all his Disciples</hi> to <hi>forsake</hi> him in his extrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity; and I doubt it will seem strange <hi>to us,</hi> when in <hi>our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamity,</hi> and our suffering for Christ (and perhaps <hi>for them</hi>) we shall find our selves forsaken by those that we most highly valued, and had the greatest familiarity with. But there are many Reasons of this permissive providence open to our ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation.</p>
                  <p>1. No wonder if when Christ was suffering <hi>for sin,</hi> he would even then permit the power and odiousness of sin to break sorth, that it might be known he suffered <hi>not in vain.</hi> No won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if he permitted his followers to desert him, and to shew the latent unbelief, and selfishness, and unthankfulness that remained in them, that so they might know that the death of Christ was as necessary for them as for others; and the <hi>universality</hi> of the <hi>disease</hi> might shew the need that the <hi>remedy</hi> should be <hi>universal.</hi> And it is none of Christs intent to make his servants to seem better then they are, to themselves or others, or to honour himself by the hiding of their faults, but to magnifie his pardoning and healing grace, by the means or occasion of the sins which he pardoneth and healeth.</p>
                  <p>2. Hereby he will bring his followers to the fuller know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of themselves, and shew them that which all their dayes should keep them humble, and watchful, and save them from presumption and trusting in themselves: When we have made any full confession of Christ, or done him any considerable service, we are apt to say with the Disciples, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 27. [<hi>Behold we have forsaken all and followed thee; What shall we have?</hi>] As if they had rather been <hi>Givers</hi> to Christ, then <hi>Receivers</hi> from him; and had highly merited at his hands: But when <hi>Peter</hi> forsweareth him, and the rest shift for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and when they come to themselves, after such cowardly
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:59347:169"/>
and ungrateful dealings, then they will better understand their weakness, and know on whom they must depend.</p>
                  <p>3. Hereby also they shall better understand what they <hi>would have been,</hi> if God had left them to themselves, that so they may be thankful for grace received, and may not boast themselves against the miserable world, as if they had made themselves to differ, and had not received all that grace by which they excel the common sort: when our falls have hurt us and shamed us, we shall know to whom we must be behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to support us.</p>
                  <p>4. Christ would permit his Disciples thus far to forsake him, because he would have no <hi>support from man,</hi> in his <hi>suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings for man:</hi> This was part of his voluntary humiliation, to be deprived of all earthly comforts, and to bear affliction even from those few, that but lately were his faithful servants: that <hi>men</hi> dealing like <hi>men,</hi> and <hi>sinners,</hi> while he was doing like <hi>God,</hi> and as a <hi>Saviour,</hi> no man might challenge to himself the honour of contributing to the Redemption of the world, so much as by encouraging the Redeemer.</p>
                  <p>5. Christ did permit the Faith and courage of his Disciples thus far to fail, that their witness to him might be of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter credit and authority, when his actual Resurrection and the Communication of the Spirit should compel them to believe: when all their doubts were dissipated, they that had doubted themselves, and yet were constrained to believe, would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived as the most impartial witnesses by the doubting world.</p>
                  <p>6. Lastly, by the desertion and dissipation of his Disciples, Christ would teach us whenever we are called to follow him in suffering, what to expect from the best of men; Even to know that of themselves they are untrusty, and may fail us: and therefore not to look for too much assistance or encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement from them. <hi>Paul</hi> lived in a time when Christians were more self-denying and stedfast than they are now: And <hi>Paul</hi> was one that might better expect to be faithftlly accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied in his sufferings for Christ, than any of us: And yet he saith, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 16. [<hi>At my first answer no man stood with me, but all men forsook me:</hi>] and prayeth, that it be not laid to their charge: Thus you have seen some Reasons why Christ consented to be left of all, and permitted his Disciples to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert him in his sufferings.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="302" facs="tcp:59347:170"/>Yet note here, that it is but a partial temporary <hi>forsaking</hi> that Christ permitteth; and not a total or final forsaking or Apostasie. Though he will let them see that they are <hi>yet men,</hi> yet will he not leave them to be but <hi>as other men:</hi> Nor will he quite cast them off, or suffer them to perish.</p>
                  <p>Nor is it all alike that thus forsake him; <hi>Peter</hi> doth not do as <hi>Judas:</hi> The <hi>sincere</hi> may manifest their <hi>infirmity;</hi> but the <hi>Hypocrites</hi> will manifest their <hi>hypocrisie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And accordingly in <hi>our sufferings</hi> our familiars that were false-hearted (as being worldlings and carnal at the heart) may perhaps <hi>betray</hi> us, and <hi>set against us,</hi> or <hi>forsake the cause of Christ,</hi> and follow the way of gain and honour: when our tempted shrinking friends that yet may have some sincerity, may perhaps <hi>look strange</hi> at us, and seem <hi>not</hi> to <hi>know us,</hi> and may hide their heads, and shew their fears; and perhaps also begin to study some self<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>deceiving arguments and distinctions, and to stretch their consciences, and venture on some sin, because they are afraid to venture on affliction; till Christ shall cast a gracious rebuking quickning aspect on them, and shame them for their sinful shame, &amp; fear them from their sinful fears, and inflame their Love to him by the motions of his Love to them, and destroy the Love that turned them from him: And then the same men that dishonourably failed Christ and us, and began to shrink, will turn back and reassume their arms, and by patient suffering overcome, and win the Crown as we have done before them.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Use.</hi> CHristians, expect to be conformed to your Lord in <hi>this part</hi> of his Humiliation also: Are your friends yet fast and friendly to you? For all that expect that <hi>many</hi> of them at least should prove less friendly: and promise not your selves an unchanged constancy in them: Are they yet <hi>useful</hi> to you? expect the time when they cannot help you: Are they your comforters and delight, and is their company much of your solace upon earth? Be ready for the time when they <hi>may</hi> become your sharpest scourges, and most heart-peircing griefs, or at least when you shall say, We have no pleasure in them. Have any of them, or all, already failed you? what
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:59347:170"/>
wonder? Are they not men, and sinners? To whom were they ever so constant as not to fail them? Rebuke your selves for your unwarrantable expectations from them: And learn hereafter to know what man is, and expect that friends should use you as followeth.</p>
                     <p>1. Some of them that you <hi>thought sincere,</hi> shall prove per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps <hi>unfaithful</hi> and <hi>dissemblers,</hi> and upon <hi>fallings out,</hi> or mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>self-interest</hi> may seek yout ruine. Are you better than <hi>David</hi> that had an <hi>Achitophel?</hi> or than <hi>Paul</hi> that had a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas?</hi> or than Christ that had a <hi>Judas?</hi> Some will <hi>forsake God:</hi> what wonder then if they forsake you? <hi>Because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold,</hi> Mat. 24. 12. Where pride and vain-glory, and sensuality and worldliness are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortified at the heart, there is no trustiness in such persons: For their wealth, or honour, or fleshly interest, they will part with God and their salvation; much more with their best de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving friends. Why may not you as well as <hi>Job</hi> have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to complain, [<hi>He hath put my Brethren far from me, and my acquaintance are very estranged from me: My kinsfolk have failed, and my familiar friends have forgotten me: They that dwell in my house, and my Maidens count me for a stranger: I am an alien in their sight: I called my servant, and he gave me no answer: I intreated him with my mouth: My breath is strange to my wife; though I intreated for the childrens sake of my own body: Yea young children despised me: I arose, and they spake against me: All my inward friends abhorred me: and they whom I loved are turned against me,</hi> Job 19. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19. Why may not you as well as <hi>David</hi> be put to say <hi>Yea mine own familiar friend in whom I trusted, which did eat of my bread hath lift up his heel against me!</hi>] Psal. 41. 9. Those that have been most acquainted with the secrets of your soul, and privy to your very thoughts, may be the persons that shall betray you, or grow strange to you. Those that you have most ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged by benefits, may prove your greatest enemies. You may find some of your friends like birds of prey, that hover about you for what they can get, and when they have catcht it, fly away<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If you have given them all that you have, they will forsake you, and perhaps reproach you, because you have no more to give them. They are your friends more for what
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:59347:171"/>
they <hi>yet expect</hi> from you, than for what they have <hi>already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</hi> If you cannot <hi>still</hi> be helpful to them, or feed their covetous desires, or supply their wants, you are to them but as one that they had never known. Many a faithful Minister of Christ hath studied, and preacht, and prayed, and wept for their peoples souls, and after all have been taken for their enemies, and used as such; yea even <hi>because</hi> they have <hi>done so much</hi> for them. Like the Patient, that being cured of a mortal sickness, sued his Physician at Law for making him sick with the Physick (But it is indeed <hi>our uncured</hi> patients on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that are offended with us.) <hi>Paul</hi> was accounted an enemy to the <hi>Galathians,</hi> because he told them the truth. Ungrateful truth maketh the faithfullest Preachers most ungrateful. Is must seem no wonder to a Preacher of the Gospel, when he hath entreated, prayed and wept night and day for miserable souls, and laid his hands as it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were under their seet in hopes of their conversion and salvation, to find them after all, his bitter enemies, and seeking his destruction, that could have laid down his life for their salvation. <hi>Jeremy</hi> seemed too impatient under this affliction, when he said [<hi>Give heed to me O Lord, and hearken to the voice of them that contend with me: Shall evil be recompenced for good? Remember that I stood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee to speak good for them, and to turn away thy wrath from them: Therefore deliver up their children to the famine, and pour out their blood by the force of the sword, &amp;c.</hi> Jer. 18. 19, 20.</p>
                     <p>Thus may ingratitude afflict you, and kindness be requited with unkindness, and the greatest benefits be forgotten, and requited with the greatest wrongs: your old familiars may be your foes: and you may be put to say as Jeremy [<hi>For I heard the defaming of many: fear on every side: Report, say they, and we will report it: All my familiars watched for my halting, saying, Peradventure he will be enticed, and we shall prevail against him, and we shall take our revenge on him.</hi>] Jer. 20. 10. Thus must the servants of Christ be used, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to their suffering Head.</p>
                     <p>2. And some that <hi>are sincere,</hi> and whose hearts are with you, may yet be drawn by temptation to <hi>disown</hi> you: when malice is slandering you, timerous friendship may perhaps
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:59347:171"/>
be silent, and afraid to justifie you, or take your part: when a <hi>Peter</hi> in such imbecillity and fear can disown and deny his <hi>suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Lord,</hi> what wonder if saint-hearted friends disown you, or me, that may give them too much occasion or pretence? why may not you and I be put to say as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Psal.</hi> 38. 11, 12. [<hi>My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore, and my kisnmen stand afar off: They that seek after my life lay snares for me: and they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and imagine deceits all the day long!</hi>] They that in fearfulness will fail their <hi>Maker and Redeemer,</hi> and hazard their <hi>salvation,</hi> may by a <hi>smaller</hi> temptation be drawn to fail such <hi>friends as we.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3, Moreover, a hundred things may occasion <hi>fallings out,</hi> even amongst <hi>unfeigned friends: Passions</hi> may cause inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient actions or expressions, and these may cause passions in their friends; and these may grow so high till friends do seem to one another to be like enemies: <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> may grow so hot, as to fall out to a parture. How easily can Satan set fire on the tinder which he findeth in the best and gentlest natures, if God permit him? No friends so near and dear, that passionate weaknesses may not either alienate or make a grief to one another, How apt are we to <hi>take unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses</hi> at one another, and to be <hi>suspicious</hi> of our friends, or <hi>offended</hi> with them? And how apt to <hi>give occasion</hi> of such of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence? How apt are we to censure one another, and to mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interpret the words and actions of our friends? And how apt to give occasion of such mistakes and cutting censures? And the more kindness we have found in, or expected from our friends, the more their real or supposed injuries will affect us. We are apt to say, [<hi>Had it been a stranger, I could have born it: But to be used thus by my bosome or familiar friend, goes near my heart.</hi>] And indeed the unkindnesses of friends is no small affliction; the suffering going usually as near the heart, as the person that caused it was near it: especially when our own weakness causeth us to forget the frailty and infirmities of man, and with what allowances and expectations we must choose and use our friends; and when we forget the Love that remaineth in the midst of passions.</p>
                     <p>4. Also <hi>cross-interests</hi> and unsuitableness may exceedingly interrupt the fastest friendship. <hi>Friendship</hi> is very much founded
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:59347:172"/>
in <hi>suitableness,</hi> and maintained by it: And among mortals, there is no perfect suitableness to be found; but much unsui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableness still remaineth. That which pleaseth one, is displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to another: One liketh this place, and the other that: One liketh this habit, and the other that: One is for mirth, and the other for sadness: One for talk, and the other for silence: One for a publick, and the other for a private life. And their personality or individuation having self-love as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separable, will unavoidably cause a contrariety of interests. The Creature is insufficient for us: If one have it, perhaps the other must want it: Like a covering too narrow for the bed. Sometimes our <hi>Reputations</hi> seem to stand cross, so that one mans is diminished by anothers: and then how apt is envy to create a grudge, and raise unfriendly jealousies and distastes! Sometimes the <hi>commodity</hi> of one is the <hi>discommodity</hi> of the other: And then [<hi>Mine</hi> and <hi>Thine</hi>] (which are contrary to the community of friendship) may divide, and alienate, and make <hi>Two</hi> of those that seemed <hi>One.</hi> The instances of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and <hi>Lot</hi> (upon the difference among their servants) and of <hi>Isaac</hi> and <hi>Ishmael,</hi> and of <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Esau,</hi> and of <hi>Laban</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and of <hi>Leah</hi> and <hi>Rachel,</hi> and of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph</hi> and his Brethren, and of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and of <hi>Ziba, Mephibosheth</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> with many others tell us this. It is rare to meet with a <hi>Jonathan,</hi> that will endearedly love that man to the death, who is appointed to deprive him of a Kingdome. If one can but say [<hi>I suffer by him, or I am a looser by him</hi>] it seemeth enough to excuse unfriendly thoughts and actions. When you can gratifie the desires of all the covetous, ambitious, self-seeking persons in the world, or else cure their diseases, and possess their minds with perfect Charity, then all the world will be your friends.</p>
                     <p>5. <hi>Cross opinions</hi> also are like to alienate many of your friends. This age hath over and over again given the world as full and sad demonstrations of the power of <hi>Cross opinions,</hi> to alienate friends, and make divisions, as most ages of the world have ever had. If your friend be <hi>proud,</hi> it's wonderful how he will slight you, and withdraw his Love, if you be not <hi>of his mind.</hi> If he he <hi>zealous,</hi> he is easily tempted, to think it a part of his duty to God, to disown you if you differ from him,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:59347:172"/>
as taking you for one that disowneth the truth of God, and therefore one that God himself disowneth; or at least to grow <hi>cold</hi> in his affection toward you, and to decline from you, as he that thinks you do from God. As agreement in opinions doth strangely reconcile affections; so disagreement doth secretly and strangely alienate them; even before you are well aware, your friend hath lost possession of your hearts, because of an unavoidable diversity of apprehensions: When all your friends have the same intellectual complexion and tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and measure of understanding with your selves, then you may have hope to escape the ruptures which unlikeliness and differences of apprehensions might else cause.</p>
                     <p>6. Moreover, some of your friends may so far <hi>overgrow</hi> you in <hi>wisdome,</hi> or <hi>wealth,</hi> or <hi>honour,</hi> or <hi>worth</hi> in their <hi>own conceits,</hi> that they may begin to take you to be unsuitable for them, and unmeet for their further special friendship. Alas poor man, they will pitty thee that thou art no wiser, and that thou hast no greater light to change thy mind as fast as they, or that thou art so weak and ignorant as not to see what seems to them so clear a truth; or that thou art so simple to cast away thy self by crossing them that might prefer thee, or to fall under the displeasure of those that have power to raise or ruine thee: But if thou <hi>be</hi> so <hi>simple,</hi> thou mayest be the object of their <hi>lamentation,</hi> but art no <hi>familiar friend</hi> for them. They think it fittest to close and converse with those of their own <hi>rank</hi> and <hi>stature,</hi> and not with such <hi>shrubs</hi> and <hi>children,</hi> that may prove their trouble and dishonour.</p>
                     <p>7. And some of your friends will think that by a more <hi>through acquaintance</hi> with you, they have found out more of your <hi>infirmities</hi> or <hi>faults;</hi> and therefore have found that you are <hi>less amiable</hi> and <hi>valuable</hi> than at first they judged you: They will think that by distance, unacquaintedness, and an overhasty love and judgement, they were mistaken in you; and that now they see reason to <hi>repent</hi> of the love which they think was guilty of some <hi>errours</hi> and <hi>excess:</hi> when they come nearer you, and have had more tryal of you, they will think they are fitter to judge of you than before: And indeed our defects are so many, and all our infirmities so great, that the more men know us, the more they may see in us that deserveth pitty or
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:59347:173"/>
reproof; and as pictures, we appear less beautiful at the nearest view: Though this will not warrant the withdrawing of that Love which is due to friends, and to vertue even in the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: nor will excuse that alienation and decay of friendship that is caused by the pride of such as overlook perhaps much greater failings and weaknesses in themselves, which need for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness.</p>
                     <p>8. And perhaps <hi>some</hi> of your friends will <hi>grow weary</hi> of their friendship, having that infirmity of humane nature, not to be much <hi>pleased</hi> with <hi>one thing long.</hi> Their Love is a flower that quickly withereth: It is a short-lived thing that soon groweth old. It must be <hi>novelty</hi> that must feed their love and their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.</p>
                     <p>9. And perhaps they may have got some <hi>better friends</hi> in their apprehensions, that may have so much interest as to take them up, and leave no room for antient friends. It may be they have met with those that are <hi>more suitable,</hi> or <hi>can</hi> be <hi>more useful</hi> to them: that have <hi>more learning,</hi> or <hi>wit,</hi> or <hi>wealth,</hi> or <hi>power,</hi> than <hi>you</hi> have, and therefore seem more worthy of their friendship.</p>
                     <p>10. And some of them may think when you are in a <hi>low</hi> and <hi>suffering state,</hi> and in <hi>danger</hi> of <hi>worse,</hi> that it is part of their <hi>duty of self-preservation</hi> to be strange to you (though in heart they wish you well.) They will think they are <hi>not bound</hi> to hazard themselves upon the displeasure of superiours, to own or befriend you or any other: Though they must not desert Christ, they think they may desert <hi>a man</hi> for their own preservation.</p>
                     <p>To avoid both extreams in such a case, men must both study to understand which way is most serviceable to Christ, and to his Church, and withall to be able to deny themselves, and also must study to understand what Christ meaneth in his final sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence [<hi>In as much as you did it (or did it not) to one of the least of these my brethren, you did it (or did it not) to me.</hi>] As if it were to <hi>visit the contagious,</hi> we must neither cast away our lives to <hi>do no good,</hi> or for that which in <hi>value</hi> holdeth no <hi>proportion</hi> with them; nor yet must we deny to run any hazard when it is <hi>indeed our duty:</hi> So is it in our visiting those that suffer for the cause of Christ: (but that here the <hi>owning them</hi> being the <hi>confessing of him,</hi> we need more seldome to fear being too for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.)</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="309" facs="tcp:59347:173"/>11. And some of your friends may cover their unfaithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness with the pretence of <hi>some fault</hi> that you have been guilty of, some <hi>errour</hi> that you hold, or some <hi>unhansome</hi> or <hi>culpable</hi> act that you have done, or some <hi>duty</hi> that you have <hi>left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done</hi> or <hi>failed</hi> in. For they think there is not a better shelter for their <hi>unfaithfulness,</hi> then to pretend for it the <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Cause of God,</hi> and so to make a <hi>duty</hi> of their <hi>sin.</hi> Who would not justifie them, if they can but prove, that <hi>God requireth them,</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> obligeth them to forsake you for your faults? There are few crimes in the world that by some are not fathered on God (that most hateth them) as thinking no name can so much honour them. False friends therefore use this means as well as other Hypocrites: And though <hi>God is Love,</hi> and condemneth nothing more then <hi>uncharitableness</hi> and <hi>malice,</hi> yet <hi>these</hi> are commonly by falshearted Hypocrites, called by some pious vertuous names, and God himself is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to them: so that few worldlings, ambitious persons or timeservers; but will confidently pretend Religion for all their falshood to their friends, or bloody cruelty to the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of Christ, that comply not with their carnal interest.</p>
                     <p>12. Perhaps some of your friends may <hi>really mistake your case,</hi> and think that you suffer as <hi>evil doers,</hi> and instead of <hi>comforting</hi> you may be your <hi>sharpest censurers:</hi> This is one of the most notable things set out to our observation in the book of <hi>Job:</hi> It was not the smallest part of his affliction, that when the hand of God was heavy upon him, and then if ever was the time for his friends to have been his comforters, and friends indeed, on the contrary <hi>they</hi> became his <hi>scourge,</hi> and by <hi>unjust accusations,</hi> and <hi>misinterpretations</hi> of the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, did greatly add to his affliction! when God had taken away his children, wealth and health, his friends would take away the reputation and comfort of his integrity; and under pretence of bringing him to repentance, did charge him with that which he was never guilty of; <hi>They</hi> wounded his <hi>good-name,</hi> and would have wounded his <hi>conscience,</hi> and deprived him of his inward peace: Censorious false accusing friends do cut deeper then malicious slandering enemies: It is no wonder if <hi>strangers</hi> or <hi>enemies</hi> do misjudge and misreport our actions: But when your <hi>bosome friends,</hi> that should most
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:59347:174"/>
intimately know you, and be the chief witness of your inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency against all others, shall in their jealousie, or envy, or peevishness, or falling out, be your chief reproachers and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just accusers, as it makes it serve more credible to others, so it will come nearest to your selves. And yet this is a thing that must be expected: yea even your most self-denying acts of obedience to God, may be so misunderstood by godly men, and real friends, as by them to be taken for your great mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage, and turned to your rebuke: As <hi>Davids</hi> dancing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Ark was by his wife; which yet did but make him resolve to be yet more vile. If you be cast into poverty, or disgrace, or prison, or banishment, for your necessary obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Christ, perhaps your friend or wife may become your accuser for this your greatest service, and say, This is your own doing: your rashness, or indiscretion, or self-conceited<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, or willfulness hath brought it upon you: what need had you to say such words, or to do this or that? why could not you have yeilded in so small a matter?] Perhaps your <hi>costliest</hi> and <hi>most excellent obedience</hi> shall by your <hi>nearest friends</hi> be called the fruits of <hi>pride,</hi> or <hi>humour,</hi> or <hi>passion,</hi> or some cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt affection, or at least of <hi>folly</hi> and <hi>inconsiderateness.</hi> When flesh and blood hath long been striving <hi>in you</hi> against your duty, and saying, [Do not cast away thy self: O serve not God at so dear a rate: God doth not require thee to undo thy self: why shouldest thou not avoid so great inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences?] When with much ado you have conquered all your carnal reasonings, and denyed your selves and your carnal interest, you must expect even from some religious friends, to be accused for these very actions, and perhaps their accusations may fasten such a blot upon your names, as shall never be washed out till the day of judgement. By difference of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests, or apprehensions, and by unacquaintedness with your hearts, and actions, the righteousness of the righteous may be thus taken from him, and friends may do the work of enemies, yea of Satan himself the accuser of the brethren; and may prove as thorns in your bed, and gravel in your shoes, yea in your eyes, and wrong you much more then open adversaries could have done. How it is like to go with that <hi>mans reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> you may easily judge, whose <hi>friends</hi> are like <hi>Jobs,</hi> and his
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:59347:174"/>
                        <hi>enemies</hi> like <hi>Davids</hi> that lay snares before him, and diligently watch for matter of reproach: yet this may befall the <hi>best of men.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>13. You may be permitted by God to fall into some <hi>real crime,</hi> and then your friends may possibly think it is their <hi>duty</hi> to disown you, so far as you have wronged God: When you provoke <hi>God</hi> to frown upon you, he may cause your <hi>friends</hi> to frown upon you: If you will fall out with him, and grow strange to him, no marvel if your truest friends fall out with you, and grow strange to you. They love you for your god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, and for the sake of Christ; and therefore <hi>must</hi> abate their love if you abate your godliness; and must for the sake of Christ be displeased with you for your sins. And if in such a case of real guilt, you should be displeased at their displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and should expect that your friend should befriend your sin, or carry himself towards you in your guilt as if you were innocent, you will but shew that you understand not the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of true friendship, nor the use of a true friend; and are yet your selves too friendly to your sins.</p>
                     <p>14. Moreover, those few friends that are truest to you, may be utterly unable to relieve you in your distress, or to give you ease, or do you any good. The case may be such that they can but pitty you and lament your sorrows, and weep over you: you may see in them that man is not as God, whose friendship can accomplish all the good that he desireth to his friends. The wisest and greatest and best of men are silly comforters, and uneffectual helps: you may be sick, and pained, and grieved, and distressed, notwithstanding any thing that they can do for you: Nay perhaps in their ignorance, they may increase your misery, while they desire your relief<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and by striving indirectly to help and ease you, may tye the knot faster and make you worse. They may provoke those more against you that oppress you, while they think they speak that which should tend to set you free: They may think to <hi>ease</hi> your troubled minds by such words as shall <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease</hi> the trouble: or to deliver you as <hi>Peter</hi> would have delivered Christ, and saved his Saviour, first by <hi>carnal counsel,</hi> Matth. 16. 22. [<hi>Be it far from thee Lord; this shall not be unto thee</hi>] And then by <hi>carnal unjust force,</hi> (by drawing his sword
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:59347:175"/>
against the officers.) <hi>Love and good meaning</hi> will not prevent the mischiefs of ignorance and mistake. If your friend <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ut your throat while he thought to cut but a vein to cure your disease, it is not his <hi>friendly meaning</hi> that will save your lives. Many a thousand sick people are <hi>killed</hi> by their <hi>friends,</hi> that attend them with an earnest desire of their life; while they ignorantly give them that which is contrary to their disease, and will not be the less pernicious for the good meaning of the giver. Who have more tender affections then Mothers to their children? And yet a great part of the calamity of the world of sickness, and the misery of mans life, proceedeth from the ignorant and erroneous indulgence of Mothers to their children, who to please them, let them eat and drink what they will, and use them to excess and gluttony in their childhood, till nature be abused and mastered and clogged with those superfluities and crudities, which are the dunghill matter of most of the following diseases of their lives.</p>
                     <p>I might here also remember you how your friends may themselves be overcome with a temptation, and then become the more dangerous tempters of you, by how much the greater their interest is in your affections. If they be infected with <hi>errour,</hi> they are the likest persons to ensnare you: If they be tainted with <hi>Covetousness</hi> or <hi>Pride,</hi> there is none so likely to draw you to the same sin: And so your <hi>friends</hi> may be in <hi>effect</hi> your most deadly <hi>enemies,</hi> deceivers and destroyers.</p>
                     <p>15. And if you have <hi>friends</hi> that are never so <hi>firm</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,</hi> they may prove (not only <hi>unable</hi> to relieve you, but) very <hi>additions</hi> to your <hi>grief.</hi> If <hi>they</hi> are <hi>afflicted</hi> in the <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation</hi> of <hi>your sufferings,</hi> as <hi>your troubles</hi> are become <hi>theirs</hi> (without your case) so <hi>their trouble for you</hi> will become <hi>yours,</hi> and so your stock of sorrow will be encreased. And they are mortals, and lyable to distress as well you. And therefore they are like to bear their share in several sorts of sufferings: And so friendship will make their sufferings to be yours: Their sicknesses and pains, their fears and griefs, their wants and dangers, will all be <hi>yours.</hi> And the <hi>more</hi> they are your <hi>hearty friends,</hi> the <hi>more</hi> they will be <hi>yours.</hi> And so you will have as many additions to the proper burden of your griefs, as you have <hi>suffering friends:</hi> When you do but hear that they are
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:59347:175"/>
dead, you say as <hi>Thomas,</hi> Joh. 11. 16. [<hi>Let us also go that we may die with him.</hi>] And having <hi>many</hi> such friends you will almost alwaies have one or other of them in distress; and so be seldome free from sorrow; besides all that which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly your own.</p>
                     <p>16. Lastly, if you have a friend that is both <hi>true</hi> and <hi>use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> yet you may be sure he must stay with you but a little while. <hi>The godly men will cease, and the faithful fail from among the children of men; while men of lying flattering lips, and double hearts survive, and the wicked walk on every side while the vilest men are exalted,</hi> Psal. 12. 1, 2, 8. while swarms of false malicious men, are left round about you, perhaps God will take away your <hi>dearest friends:</hi> If among a multitude of unfaithful ones, you have <hi>but one</hi> that is your <hi>friend indeed,</hi> perhaps God will take away <hi>that one.</hi> He may be <hi>separated</hi> from you into <hi>another Country;</hi> or taken away to <hi>God by death.</hi> Not that God doth grudge you the mercy of a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful friend; but that <hi>he would</hi> be <hi>your All,</hi> and would not have you <hi>hurt</hi> your selves with too much affection to any Creature, and for other reasons to be named anon.</p>
                     <p>And to be <hi>forsaken</hi> of your friends, is not all your affliction: but to <hi>be so forsaken</hi> is a great aggravation of it. 1. For they use to forsake us in our greatest sufferings and streights, when we have the <hi>greatest need</hi> of them.</p>
                     <p>2. They fail us most at a <hi>dying hour,</hi> when all other worldly comfort faileth: As we must leave our houses, lands and wealth, so must we for the present leave our friends: And as all the rest are silly comforters, when we have once received our citation to appear before the Lord, so also are our friends but silly comforters: They can weep over us, but they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not with all their care, delay the separating stroak of death, one day or hour.</p>
                     <p>Only by their prayers, and holy advice, remembring us of everlasting things, and provoking us in the work of prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they may prove to us friends indeed. And therefore we must value a holy, heavenly, faithful friend, as one of the greatest treasures upon earth. And while we take notice how <hi>as men</hi> they may forsake us, we must not deny but that <hi>as Saints</hi> they are precious, and of singular use to us; and Christ
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:59347:176"/>
useth <hi>by them</hi> to communicate his mercies; and if any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in the world may be blessings to us, it is <hi>holy persons,</hi> that have most of God in their hearts and lives.</p>
                     <p>3. And it is an aggravation of the cross, that they often fail us, when we <hi>are most faithful in our duty,</hi> and stumble most upon the most <hi>excellent acts</hi> of our <hi>obedience.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>4. And those are the persons that ofttimes fail us, of whom we have <hi>deserved best,</hi> and from whom we might have <hi>expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed most.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Review the experiences of the choicest servants that Christ hath had in the world, and you shall find enough to confirm you of the vanity of man, and the instability of the dearest friends. How highly was <hi>Athanasius</hi> esteemed? and yet at last deserted and banished even by the famous <hi>Constantine</hi> himself! How excellent a man was <hi>Gregory Nazianzene,</hi> and highly valued in the Church? and yet by reproach and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements driven away from his Church at <hi>Constantinople</hi> whither he was chosen: and envied by the Bishops round about him. How worthy a man was the eloquent <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> and highly valued in the Church! And yet how bitterly was he prosecuted by <hi>Hierome</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius;</hi> and banished, and dyed in a second banishment, by the provocation of factious contentious Bishops, and an Empress impatient of his plain reproofs? What person more generally esteemed and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured for learning, piety and peaceableness then <hi>Melanch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thon?</hi> and yet by the contentions of <hi>Illyricus</hi> and his party, he was made aweary of his life. As highly as <hi>Calvin</hi> was (de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servedly) valued at <hi>Geneva,</hi> yet once in a popular lunacy and displeasure, they drove him out of their City, and in contempt of him some called their dogs by the name of <hi>Calvin;</hi> (though after they were glad to intreat him to return.) How much our <hi>Grindal</hi> and <hi>Abbot</hi> were esteemed, it appeareth by their advancement to the Archbishoprick of <hi>Canterbury:</hi> and yet who knoweth not that their eminent piety sufficed not to keep them from dejecting frowns! And if you say, that it is no wonder if with <hi>Princes</hi> through <hi>interest,</hi> and with <hi>people</hi> through <hi>levity,</hi> it be thus; I might heap up instances of the like untrustiness of <hi>particular friends:</hi> But all History and the experiences of the most, do so much abound with them, that I
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:59347:176"/>
think it needless. Which of us must not say with <hi>David</hi> that [<hi>all men are lyars</hi>] Psal. 116. that is, <hi>deceitful</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusty,</hi> either through unfaithfulness, weakness or insufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy that either will forsake us, or cannot help us in the time of need?</p>
                     <p>Was <hi>Christ forsaken</hi> in his extremity by his <hi>own Disciples,</hi> to teach us what to <hi>expect,</hi> or <hi>bear?</hi> Think it not strange then to be conformed to your Lord, in this, as well as in other parts of his humiliation. <hi>Expect</hi> that <hi>men</hi> should prove <hi>deceitful:</hi> Not that you should entertain <hi>censorious</hi> suspicions of your <hi>particular friends:</hi> but remember in general that <hi>man is frail,</hi> and the <hi>best</hi> too <hi>selfish</hi> and <hi>uncertain;</hi> and that it is no wonder if those should prove your greatest grief, from whom you had the highest expectations. Are you better then <hi>Job,</hi> or <hi>David,</hi> or Christ? and are your friends more firm and unchangeable then theirs?</p>
                     <p>Consider, 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That Creatures must be set at a sufficient di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from their Creator. Allsufficiency, Immutability and indefectible fidelity, are proper to Jehovah. As it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for the Sun to set or be ecclipsed, as glorious a body as it is; so it is no wonder for a friend, a pious friend, to fail us, for a time, in the hour of our distress. There are <hi>some</hi> that <hi>will not:</hi> but there is <hi>none</hi> but <hi>may,</hi> if God should leave them to their weakness. <hi>Man</hi> is not your <hi>Rock:</hi> He hath <hi>no stabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> but what is derived, dependant, and uncertain, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectible. Learn therefore to <hi>rest</hi> on <hi>God alone,</hi> and lean not too hard or confidently upon any mortal might.</p>
                     <p>2. And God will have the <hi>common infirmity</hi> of man to be <hi>known,</hi> that so the <hi>weakest</hi> may not be <hi>utterly discouraged,</hi> nor take their <hi>weakness</hi> to be <hi>gracelesness,</hi> whilest they see that the <hi>strongest</hi> also have their <hi>infirmities,</hi> though not <hi>so great</hi> as theirs. If any of Gods servants lives in constant holiness and fidelity, without <hi>any shakings</hi> or stumbling in their way, it would tempt some self<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>accusing troubled souls, to think that they were altogether graceless, because they are so far short of others. But when we read of a <hi>Peters</hi> denying his Master in so horrid a manner, with swearing and cursing that he knew not the man, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 74. and of his dissimulation and not walking uprightly, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. and of a <hi>Davids</hi> unfriendly
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:59347:177"/>
and unrighteous dealing with <hi>Mephihosheth,</hi> the seed of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan;</hi> and of his most vile and treacherous dealing with <hi>Uriah,</hi> a faithful and deserving subject; it may both abate our wonder and offence at the unfaithfulness of our friends, and teach us to compassionate their frailty, when they desert us; and also somewhat abate our immoderate dejected<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and trouble, when we have failed God or man our selves.</p>
                     <p>3. Moreover, consider, how the <hi>odiousness</hi> of that <hi>sin,</hi> which is the root and cause of such unfaithfulness, is greatly mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested by the failing of our friends. God will have the <hi>odious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of the <hi>remnants</hi> of our <hi>self-love</hi> and <hi>carnalmindedness,</hi> and <hi>cowardize</hi> appear: we should not discern it in the seed and root, if we did not see, and tast it in the fruits. <hi>Seeing</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>tasting</hi> will not sufficiently convince us: A crab looks as beautiful as an apple; but when you <hi>tast</hi> it, you better know the difference. When you must your selves be unkindly used by your friends, and forsaken by them in your distress, and you have <hi>tasted</hi> the fruits of the remnants of their worldliness, selfishness and carnal fears, you will better know the odious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of these vices, which thus break forth against all obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to God and you, and notwithstanding the light, the conscience, and perhaps the grace, that doth resist them.</p>
                     <p>4. Are you not prone to <hi>overvalue</hi> and <hi>overlove</hi> your friends? If so, is not this the meetest remedy for your disease? In the <hi>loving of God,</hi> we are in no danger of <hi>excess;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have no need of any thing to <hi>quench</hi> it. And in the <hi>loving</hi> of the <hi>godly purely</hi> upon the account of <hi>Christ,</hi> and in loving <hi>Saints</hi> as <hi>Saints,</hi> we are not apt to go <hi>too far.</hi> But yet our understandings may mistake, and we may think that Saints have more of sanctity then indeed they have; and we are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding apt to mix a <hi>selfish common love</hi> with that which is <hi>spiritual</hi> and <hi>holy;</hi> and at the same time, when we Love a <hi>Christian</hi> as a <hi>Christian,</hi> we are apt not only to Love him (as we ought) but to <hi>overlove him</hi> because he is <hi>our friend,</hi> and <hi>Loveth us.</hi> Those <hi>Christians</hi> that have no <hi>special Love to us,</hi> we are apt to <hi>undervalue</hi> and <hi>neglect,</hi> and Love them below their holiness and worth: But those that we think <hi>entirely Love us,</hi> we Love <hi>above</hi> their <hi>proper worth,</hi> as they stand in the
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:59347:177"/>
esteem of God: Not but that we <hi>may</hi> Love those that Love us, and add this Love to that which is purely for the sake of Christ; but we should not let our <hi>own interest prevail</hi> and <hi>overtop</hi> the interest of Christ, nor Love any <hi>so much</hi> for <hi>Loving us,</hi> as for <hi>Loving Christ:</hi> And if we <hi>do so,</hi> no wonder if God shall use such remedies as he seeth meet, to abate our excuse of selfish love.</p>
                     <p>O how highly are we apt to think of <hi>all that Good</hi> which is found in those who are the highest <hi>esteemers of us,</hi> and most <hi>dearly love us;</hi> when perhaps in it self it is but some <hi>ordinary good,</hi> or <hi>ordinary degree</hi> of goodness which is in them! Their Love to us unresistibly procureth our Love to them: And when we Love them, it is wonderful to observe, how easily we are brought to think well of almost all they do, and highly to value their judgements, graces, parts and works: when <hi>greater excellencies</hi> in <hi>another</hi> perhaps are scarce observed, or regarded but as a common thing: And therefrre the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or want of Love, is apparent in the vilifying thoughts and speeches, that most men have of one another; and in the low esteem of the judgements, and performances and lives of other men: (much more in their contempt, reproaches and cruel persecutions.) Now though God will have us encrease in our Love of Christ in his members, and in our pure Love of Christians as such, and in our common charity to all, yea and in our just fidelity to our friend; yet would he have us suspect and moderate our selfish and excessive Love, and inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate partial esteem of one above another, when it is but for our selves, and on our own account. And therefore as he will make us know, that we our selves are no such excellent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, as that it should make another so laudable, or advance his worth, because he Loveth us; so he will make us know, that our friends whom we overvalue, are but like other men: If we exalt them too highly in our esteem, it is a sign that God must cast them down. And as their Love to us was it that made us so exalt them; so their unkindness or unfaithfulness to us, is the fittest means to bring them lower in our estimation and affection. God is very jealous of our hearts, as to our overvaluing and overloving any of his Creatures: what we give inordinately and excessively to them, is some way or other ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from him, and given them to his injury, and therefore to
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:59347:178"/>
his offence. Though I know that to be void of natural, friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or social affections, is an odious extream on the other side; yet God will rebuke us if we are guilty of excess. And it's the greater and more inexcusable fault to over-love the Creature, because our Love to God is so cold, and hardly kindled and kept alive: He cannot take it well to see us dote upon dust and frailty like our selves, at the same time when all his wondrous kindness, and attractive goodness, do cause but such a faint and languid Love to him, which we our selves can scarcely feel. If therefore he cure us by permitting our friends to shew us truly what they are, and how little they deserve such excessive Love (when God hath so little) it is no more wonder, than it is that he is tender of his glory, and merciful to his servants souls.</p>
                     <p>5. By the failing and unfaithfulness of our friends, the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful <hi>Patience of God</hi> will be observed and honoured, as it is shewed both to <hi>them and us.</hi> When <hi>they forsake us</hi> in our distress (especially when we suffer for the cause of Christ) it is <hi>God</hi> that they injure more than us: And therefore if <hi>he</hi> bear with them, and forgive their weakness upon repentance, why should not <hi>we</hi> do so that are much less injured? The worlds persidiousness should make us think, How great and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful is the patience of God, that beareth with, and beareth up so vile, ungrateful, treacherous men that abuse him to whom they are infinitely obliged? And it should make us consider, when men deal treacherously with us, How great is that mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy that hath born with, and pardoned greater wrongs which I my self have done to God, than these can be which men have done to me! It was the remembran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e of <hi>David's</hi> sin, that had provoked God to raise up his own Son against him (of whom he had been too fond) which made him so easily bear the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and reproach of <hi>Shimei.</hi> It will make us bear abuse from others, to remember how ill we have dealt with God, and how ill we have deserved at his hands our selves.</p>
                     <p>6. And I have observed another of the Reasons of Gods permitting the failing of our friends, in the <hi>season</hi> and <hi>success.</hi> It is, that the <hi>Love of our friends may not hinder us when we are called to suffer or dye.</hi> When we <hi>over-love</hi> them, it teareth our very hearts to leave them: And therefore it is a strong temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:59347:178"/>
to draw us from our duty, and to be unfaithful to the cause of Christ, lest we should be taken from our too-dear friends, or lest our suffering cause their too-much grief. It is so hard a thing to dye with willingness and peace, that it must needs be a mercy to be saved from the impediments which make us backward: And the excessive Love of friends and relations, is not the least of these impediments: O how loth is many a one to dye, when they think of parting with wife, or husband, or children, or dear and faithful friends! Now I have oft observed, that a little before their death or sickness, it is ordinary with God to permit some unkindness between such too-dear friends to arise, by which he moderated and aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their affections, and made them a great deal the willinger to dye. Then we are ready to say, It is time for me to leave the world, when not only the rest of the world, but my dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest friends have first forsaken me! This helpeth us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member our dearest everlasting friend, and to be grieved at the heart that we have been no truer our selves to him, who would not have forsaken us in our extremity. And sometime it maketh us even aweary of the world, and to say as <hi>Elias,</hi> Lord take away my life, &amp;c. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19. 4, 10, 14. when we must say, I thought I had one friend left, and behold even he forsaketh me in my distress.] As the Love of friends intang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth our affections to this world, so to be weaned by their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindnesses from our friends, is a great help to loosen us from the world, and proveth oft a very great mercy to a soul that is ready to depart.</p>
                     <p>And as the friends that Love us most, and have most interest in our esteem and Love, may do more than others, in temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting us to be unfaithful to our Lord, to entertain any errour, to commit any sin, or to flinch in suffering; so when God hath permitted them to forsake us, and to lose their too great interest in us, we are fortified against all such temptations from them. I have known where a former intimate friend hath grown strange, and broken former friendship, and quickly after turned to such dangerous wayes and errours, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced the other of the mercifulness of God, in weakning his temptation by his friends desertion; who might else have drawn him along with him into sin. And I have often ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,

that when the husbands have turned from Religion to Infidelity, Familism, or some dangerous heresie, that God hath permitted them to hate and abuse their wives so inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manely, as that it preserved the poor women from the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of following them in their Apostasie or sin: When as some other women with whom their husbands have dealt more kindly, have been drawn away with them into pernicious paths.</p>
                     <p>Therefore still I must say, we were undone if we had the disposing of our own conditions. If would be long before we should have been willing our selves to be thus unkindly dealt with by our friends: And yet God hath made it to many a soul, a notable means of preserving them from being undone for ever. Yea the <hi>unfaithfulness</hi> of all our <hi>friends,</hi> and the <hi>malice</hi> and <hi>cruelty</hi> of all our <hi>enemies,</hi> doth us not usually so much harm, as the <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Temptation</hi> of some one deluded erring friend, whom we are ready to follow into the gulf.</p>
                     <p>7. Lastly, consider that it is not <hi>desirable or suitable to our state, to have too much of our comfort by any creature:</hi> Not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly because it is most pure and sweet which is most immediately from God; but also because we are very prone to overlove the Creature; and if it should but seem to be very commodious to us, by serving our necessities or desires, it would seem the more amiable, and therefore be the stronger snare: The work of mortification doth much consist in the annihilation or dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of all the Creatures as to any power to draw away our hearts from God, or to entangle us and detain us from our duty. And the more excellent and lovely the creature ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth to us, the less it is dead to us, or we to it; and the more will it be able to hinder or ensnare us.</p>
                     <p>When you have well considered all these things, I suppose you will admire the wisdome of God in leaving you under this kind of tryal, and weaning you from every creature, and teaching you by his providence as well as by his word, to <hi>Cease from man, whose breath is in his nostrils; for wherein is he to be accounted of?</hi>] And you will see that it's no great wonder that corrupted souls, that live in other sins, should be guilty of this unfaithfulness to their friends: and that he that dare unthankfully trample upon the unspeakable kindness of
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:59347:179"/>
the Lord, should deal unkindly with the best of men. You make no great wonder at other kind of sins, when you see the world continually commit them; why then should you make a greater or a stranger matter of this than of the rest? Are <hi>you</hi> better than <hi>God?</hi> Must unfaithfulness <hi>to you</hi> be made more hainous, than that unfaithfulness <hi>to him,</hi> which yet you daily see and sleight? The <hi>least</hi> wrong to God is a thousandfold more than the greatest that can be done to you, as such. Have you done that for your nearest friend, which God hath done for him and you, and all men? Their obligations to you are nothing in comparison of their great and manifold obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to God.</p>
                     <p>And <hi>you</hi> know that you have more wronged God, <hi>your selves,</hi> than any man ever wronged <hi>you:</hi> And if yet for all that <hi>he</hi> bear with <hi>you,</hi> have you not great reason to bear with others?</p>
                     <p>Yea, you have not been innocent <hi>towards men</hi> your selves: Did you never wrong or fail another? Or rather, are you not apter to see and aggravate the wrong that others do to you, than that which you have done to others? May you not call to mind your own neglects, and say, as <hi>Adonizebeck,</hi> Judg. 1. 7. [<hi>Threescore and ten Kings having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered their meat under my table: As I have done, so God hath requited me.</hi>] Many a one have I failed or wronged: and no wonder if others fail and wrong me.]</p>
                     <p>Nay you have been much more unfaithful and injurious to <hi>your selves,</hi> than ever any <hi>other</hi> hath been to you. No friend was so near you, as <hi>your selves:</hi> None had such a charge of of you: None had such helps and advantages to do you good or hurt: And yet all the enemies you have in the world, even in Earth or Hell, have not wronged and hurt you half so much as you have done your selves. O, methinks the man or woman that knoweth themselves, and knoweth what it is to Repent; that ever saw the greatness of their own sin and folly, should have no great mind or leisure to aggravate the failings of their friends, or the injuries of their enemies, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering what they have proved to themselves! Have I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited my <hi>own salvation,</hi> and deserved everlasting wrath, and sold my Saviour and my soul for so base a thing as sinful plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:59347:180"/>
and shall I ever make a wonder of it, that <hi>another</hi> man doth me some <hi>temporal hurt?</hi> Was any friend so near to me as my self? Or more obliged to me? O sinful soul, let <hi>thy own,</hi> rather than <hi>thy friends</hi> deceit and treachery, and neglects, be the matter of thy displeasure, wonder and complaints!</p>
                     <p>And let thy <hi>Conformity</hi> herein to Jesus Christ, be thy holy ambition and delight: Not as it is <hi>thy suffering,</hi> nor as it is caused by <hi>mens sin:</hi> but as it is thy <hi>Conformity</hi> and fellowship in the sufferings of thy Lord, and caused by his Love.</p>
                     <p>I have already shewed you that <hi>sufferers</hi> for Christ, are in in the highest form among his Disciples. The order of his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers usually is this; 1. At our entrance, and in the lowest form, we are exercised with the fears of Hell, and Gods dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure, and in the works of Repentance for the sin that we have done. 2. In the second form, we come to think more seriously of the remedy, and to enquire what we shall do to be saved, and to understand better what Christ hath done and suffered, and what he is and will be to us; and to value him and his love and grace: And here we are much enquiring how we may know our own sincerity, and our interest in Christ, and are labouring for some assurance, and looking af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter signs of grace. 3. In the next form or order we are search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after further knowledge, and labouring better to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the mysteries of Religion, and to get above the rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and first principles: And here if we scape turning bare Opinionists or Hereticks by the snare of controversie or curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, it's well. 4. In the next form we set our selves to the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler <hi>improvement</hi> of all our further <hi>degrees of knowledge;</hi> and to <hi>digest it all,</hi> and turn it into <hi>stronger Faith,</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>Hope,</hi> and <hi>greater Humility, Patience, Self-denial, Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and contempt of earthly vanities, and hatred of sin; and to walk more watchfully and holily, and to be more in holy duty. 5. In the next form we grow to be more publick-spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited: to set our hearts on the Churches welfare, and long more for the progress of the Gospel, and for the good of others; and to do all the good in the world that we are able, for mens souls or bodies, but especially to long and lay out our selves for the conversion and salvation of ignorant, secure, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted souls. The <hi>counterfeit</hi> of this, is, An eager desire
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:59347:180"/>
to proselyte others to our opinions or that Religion which we have chosen, by the direction of flesh and blood, or which is not of God, nor according unto Godliness, but doth subserve our carnal ends. 6. In the next form we grow to study more the pure and wonderful Love of God in Christ, and to rellish and admire that Love, and to be taken up with the Goodness and tender mercies of the Lord, and to be kindling the flames of holy Love to him that hath thus Loved us; and to keep our souls in the exercise of that Love: And withall to live in Joy, and Thanks, and Praise to him that hath redeemed us and Loved us. And also by Faith to converse in Heaven, and to live in holy contemplation, beholding the Glory of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Redeemer in the Glass which is fitted to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent use, till we come to see him face to face. Those that are the highest in this form, do so walk with God, and burn in Love, and are so much above inferiour vanities, and are so conversant by Faith in Heaven, that their hearts even dwell there, and there they long to be for ever. 7. And in the highest form in the School of Christ, we are exercising this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed Faith and Love, in sufferings, especially for Christ: In following him with our Cross, and being conformed to him, and glorifying God in the fullest exercise and discovery of his Graces in us, and in an actual trampling upon all that standeth up against him, for our hearts: and in bearing the fullest wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to his Truth and Cause, by constant enduring, though to the death. Not but that the <hi>weakest</hi> that are sincere, <hi>must suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for Christ</hi> if he call them to it: <hi>Martyrdome</hi> it self is not proper to the <hi>strong Believers:</hi> Whoever forsaketh not all that he hath for Christ, cannot be his Disciple, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 33. But to suffer with that Faith and Love forementioned, and in that manner, is proper to the strong: And usually God doth not try and exercise his young and weak ones with the tryals of the strong; nor set his Infants on so hard a service, nor put them in the front or hottest of the battel, as he doth the ripe confirmed Christians. The sufferings of their inward doubts and fears doth take up such: It is the <hi>strong</hi> that ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily are called to <hi>sufferings for Christ,</hi> at least in any <hi>high degree;</hi> I have digrest thus far to make it plain to you, that our <hi>Conformity to Christ, and fellowship with him in his
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:59347:181"/>
sufferings,</hi> in any <hi>notable degree,</hi> is the lot of his <hi>best confirmed servants,</hi> and the highest forme in his School among his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples: and therefore not to be inordinately feared or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred, nor to be the matter of impatiency, but of holy joy: and in such infirmities we may glory. And if it be so of <hi>sufferings</hi> in the <hi>general,</hi> (for Christ) then is it so of this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular sort of suffering, even to be forsaken of all our best and nearest, dearest friends, when we come to be most abused by the enemies.</p>
                     <p>For my own part, I must confess that as I am much wanting in other parts of my conformity to Christ, so I take my self to be yet much short, of what I expect he should advance me to, as long as my friends no more forsake me. It is not long since I found my self in a low (if not a doubting) case, because I had so few enemies and so little sufferings for the cause of Christ (though I had much of other sorts:) And now that doubt is removed by the multitude of furies which God hath let, loose against me. But yet, methinks, while my <hi>friends themselves</hi> are so <hi>friendly</hi> to me, I am much short of what I think I must at last attain to.</p>

                  <div type="part">
                     <p>BUt let us look further into the Text, and see what is the <hi>cause</hi> of the <hi>failing</hi> and <hi>forsaking</hi> Christ in the <hi>Disciples;</hi> and what it is that they betake themselves to, when they leave him.</p>

                     <p>Self-denyal was not perfect in them, selfishness therefore in this hour of temptation did prevail. They had before for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken all to follow Christ; they had left their Parents, their Families, their Estates, their Trades, to be his Disciples: But though they believed him to be the Christ, yet they dreamt of a visible Kingdome, and did all this with too carnal expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of being great men on earth, when Christ should begin his reign. And therefore when they saw his apprehension and ignominious suffering, and thought now they were fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate of their hopes, they seem to repent that they had fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him (though not by apostasie and an habitual or plenary change of mind, yet) by a sudden passionate frightful appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension,
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:59347:181"/>
which vanished when grace performed its part. They now began to think that they had <hi>lives</hi> of their <hi>Own</hi> to save, and <hi>families</hi> of their <hi>Own</hi> to mind, and <hi>business</hi> of their <hi>Own</hi> to do: They had before forsaken their <hi>private interests</hi> and <hi>affairs,</hi> and gathered themselves to Jesus Christ, and lived in commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with him, and one another. But now they return to their trades and callings, <hi>and are scattered every man to his own.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Selfishness</hi> is the great enemy of all societies, of all fidelity and friendship: There is no trusting that person in whom it is predominant. And the remnants of it where it doth not reign, do make men walk unevenly and unsteadfastly towards God and men. They will certainly deny both God and their friends, in a time of tryal who are not able to deny them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: Or rather he never was a real friend to any, that is predominantly selfish. They have alway some interest of their <hi>own,</hi> which their friend must needs contradict, or is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient to satisfie. Their houses, their lands, their monies, their children, their honour or something which they call their <hi>Own,</hi> will be frequently the matter of contention; and are so <hi>near them,</hi> that they can for the sake of these cast off the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est friend. Contract no special friendship with a selfish man: nor put no confidence in him, whatever friendship he may profess. He is so confined to himself, that he hath no true love to spare for others: If he seem to love a friend, it is not <hi>as a friend,</hi> but as a <hi>servant,</hi> or at best as a benefactour: He loveth <hi>you for himself,</hi> as he loveth his money, or horse, or house, because you may be serviceable to him: Or as a horse or dog doth love his keeper, for feeding him: And therefore when your provender is gone, his love is gone: when you have done feeding him, he hath done loving you. When you have no more for <hi>him,</hi> he hath no more for <hi>you.</hi>

                        <hi>Object.</hi> But (some will say) it is not the falseness of my friend that I lament, but the <hi>separation,</hi> or the <hi>loss</hi> of one that was most faithful: I have found the deceitfulness of ordinary friends; and therefore the more highly prize those few that are sincere. I had but <hi>one</hi> true friend among abundance of self-seekers; and that one is dead, or taken from me, and I am left as in a wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, having no mortal man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that I can trust or take much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in.</p>

                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Is this your case? I pray you answer these few Questions, and suffer the truth to have its proper work upon your mind.</p>
                     <p>Quest. 1. <hi>Who was it that deprived you of your friend?</hi> was it not God? Did not he that gave him you take him from you? Was it not his Lord and owner that call'd him home? And can God do any thing injuriously or amiss? will you not give him leave to do as he list with his own? Dare you think that there was <hi>wanting</hi> either <hi>wisdom</hi> or <hi>goodness, justice</hi> or <hi>mercy</hi> in Gods disposal of your friend? Or will you ever have <hi>Rest,</hi> if you cannot have <hi>Rest</hi> in the <hi>will</hi> of <hi>God?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. <hi>How know you what sin your friend might have fallen into, if he had lived as long as you would have him?</hi> You'l say, that God could have preserved him from sin: It's true: but God preserveth <hi>sapientially,</hi> by means, as well as <hi>omnipotentially:</hi> And sometime he seeth that the temptations to that person are like to be so strong, and his corruption like to get such advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and that no means is so fit as Death it self, for his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation. And if God had permitted your friend by tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation to have fallen into some scandalous sin, or course of evil, or into errors or false wayes, would it not have been much worse then death to him and you? God might have suffered your friend that was so <hi>faithful,</hi> to have been sifted and shaken as <hi>Peter</hi> was, and to have denied his Lord; and to have seemed in your <hi>own eyes,</hi> as odious as he before seemed <hi>amiable.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. <hi>How know you what unkindness to your self, your dearest friend might have been guilty of?</hi> Alas there is greater frailty and inconstancy in man, then you are aware of. And there are sadder roots of corruption unmortified, that may spring up into bitter fruits, then most of us ever discover in our selves. Many a Mother hath her heart broken by the unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalness of such a child, or the unkindness of such a husband, as if they had died before, would have been lamented by her, with great impatience and excess. How confident soever you may be of the future fidelity of your friend, you little know what tryal might have discovered. Many a one hath failed God and man that once were as confident of <hi>themselves,</hi> as ever you were of your <hi>friend.</hi> And which of us see not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:59347:182"/>
to be distrustful of our selves? And can we know another better then our selves? or promise more concerning him?</p>
                     <p>4. <hi>How know you what great calamity might have bifallen your friend, if he had lived as long as you desired?</hi> When the <hi>Righteous</hi> seem to men to <hi>perish,</hi> and <hi>merciful men are taken away,</hi> it is <hi>from the evil to come</hi> that they are taken, <hi>Isa.</hi> 57. 1. How many of my friends have I lamented as if they had died unseasonably, concerning whom some following providence quickly shewed me, that it would have been a grievous misery to them to have lived longer! Little know you what calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were eminent on his person, his family, kindred, neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, country, that would have broke his heart: What if a friend of yours had died immediately before some calamitous subversion of a Kingdome, some ruines of the Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and if ignorantly he had done that which brought these things to pass, can you imagine how lamentably sad his life would have been to him, to have seen the Church, the Gospel, and his Country in so sad a case? especially if it had been long of him? Many that have unawares done that which hath ruined but a particular friend, have lived in so much grief and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as made them consent that death should both revenge the injured on them, and conclude their misery. What then would it have been to have seen the publick good subverted, and the faithful overwhelmed in misery, and the Gospel hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and holy worship changed for deceit and vanity; and for conscience to have been daily saying, [I had a hand in all this misery: I kindled the fire that hath burned up all!]</p>
                     <p>What comfort can you think such friends if they had sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived, would have found on earth? Unless it were a comfort to hear the complaints of the afflicted, to see and hear such odious sins as sometimes vexed righteous <hi>Lot</hi> to see and hear; or to hear of the scandals of one friend, and the apostasie of another, and the sinful compliances and declinings of a third; and to be under temptations, reproaches and afflictions them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves? Is it a matter to be so much lamented that God hath prevented their greater miseries and wo?</p>
                     <p>5. <hi>What was the world to your friends while they did enjoy it?</hi> Or what is it now, or like to be hereafter to your selves? was it so <hi>good</hi> and <hi>kind</hi> to them, as that you should lament
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:59347:183"/>
their <hi>separation</hi> from it? was it not to them a place of toil and trouble, of envy and vexation, of enmity and poison? of successive cares and fears and griefs? and worst of all, a place of sin? Did they groan under the burden of a sinful na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, a distempered, tempted, troubled heart of languishings and weakness of every grace; of the rebukes of God, the wounds of conscience, and the malice of a wicked world? And would you have them under these again? Or is their deliverance become your grief? Did you not often joyn in prayer with them, for deliverance from malice, calamities, troubles, imperfections, temptations and sin? and now those prayers are answered in their deliverance: and do you now <hi>grieve</hi> at that which then you <hi>prayed</hi> for!</p>
                     <p>Doth the world use <hi>your selves</hi> so well and kindly, as that you should be sorry that your friends partake not of the feast? Are you not groaning from day to day your selves? and are you grieved that your friends are taken from your griefs? you are not well pleased with your own condition: when you look into your hearts you are displeased and complain: when you look into your <hi>lives,</hi> you are displeased and complain: when you <hi>look</hi> into your <hi>families,</hi> into your <hi>neighbourhoods,</hi> unto your <hi>friends,</hi> unto the <hi>Church,</hi> unto the <hi>Kingdome,</hi> unto the <hi>world,</hi> you are displeased and complain: And are you also displeased that your friends are not under the same dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasedness and complaints as you? Is the world a place of <hi>Rest</hi> or <hi>trouble</hi> to you? And would you have your friends to be as far from <hi>Rest</hi> as you?</p>
                     <p>And if you <hi>have</hi> some <hi>Ease</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> at present, you little know what storms are near! you may see the dayes, you may hear the tydings, you may feel the griping griefs and pains, which may make you call for Death your selves, and make you say that a life on earth is no felicity, and make you confess that they are <hi>Blessed that are dead in the Lord,</hi> as <hi>resting from their labours,</hi> and being past these troubles, griefs and fears. Many a poor troubled soul is in so great distress, as that they take their own lives to have some tast of Hell: and yet at the same time, are grieving because their <hi>friends</hi> are taken from them, who would have been <hi>grieved</hi> for <hi>their griefs,</hi> and for ought they know might have fallen into as sad a state as they themselves are now lamenting.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="329" facs="tcp:59347:183"/>6. <hi>Do you think it is for the Hurt or the Good of your friend, that he is removed hence?</hi> It cannot be for his <hi>Hurt</hi> unless he be in Hell. (At least, it is uncertain whether to live would have been for his Good, by an increase of Grace, and so for greater Glory.) And if he be in <hi>Hell,</hi> he was no fit person for you to take <hi>much pleasure</hi> in upon <hi>earth:</hi> He might be indeed a fit object for your <hi>compassion,</hi> but not for your <hi>complacency.</hi> Sure you are not undone for want of such company as God will not endure in his sight, and you must be separated from for ever. But if they be in <hi>Heaven,</hi> you are scarce their friends if you would wish them thence. <hi>Friendship</hi> hath as great respect to the <hi>good of our friends</hi> as <hi>of our selves.</hi> And do you pretend to friendship, and yet lament the removal of your friend to his greatest happiness! Do you set more by your own enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his company, then by his enjoying God in perfect blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness! This sheweth a very culpable defect either in <hi>Faith</hi> or <hi>Friendship;</hi> and therefore beseemeth not <hi>Christians</hi> and <hi>friends.</hi> If <hi>Love</hi> teacheth us to mourn with them that mourn, and to rejoyce with them that rejoyce; can it be an act of <hi>rational Love</hi> to <hi>mourn for them</hi> that are possessed of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est everlasting joyes?</p>
                     <p>7. <hi>God will not honour himself by one only, but by many:</hi> He knoweth best when his work is done: When our friends have finished all that God intended them for, when he put them into the world, is it not time for them to be gone, and for others to take their places, and finish <hi>their work</hi> also in their time? God will have a succession of his servants in the world. Would you not come down, and give place to him that is to follow you, when your part is played, and his is to begin? If <hi>David</hi> had not died, there had been no <hi>Solomon,</hi> no <hi>Jehosha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat,</hi> no <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> no <hi>Josiah,</hi> to succeed him and honour God in the same throne. You may as wisely grudge that one day only takes not up all the week, and that the clock striketh not the same hour still, but proceedeth from one to two, from two to three, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as to murmur that one man only con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>inueth not, to do the work of his place excluding his successors.</p>
                     <p>8. <hi>You must not have all your Mercies by one messenger or hand:</hi> God will not have you consine your <hi>Love</hi> to one only of his servants: And therefore he will not make one only use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

to you: but when one hath delivered his message and done his part, perhaps God will send you other mercies by another hand: And it belongeth to him to choose the messenger who gives the gift. And if you will childishly dote upon the first messenger, and say you will have all the rest of your mercies by his hand, or you will have no more, your frowardness more deserveth correction than compassion: and if you be kept fasting till you can thankfully take your food, from any hand that your Father sends it by, it is a correction very suitable to your sin.</p>
                     <p>9. <hi>Do you so highly value your friends for God, or for them, or for your selves, in the final consideration?</hi> If it was <hi>for God,</hi> what reason of trouble have you, that <hi>God</hi> hath disposed of them, according to his wisdome and unerring will? should you not then be more pleased that <hi>God</hi> hath them, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployeth them in his highest service, than displeased that <hi>you</hi> want them?</p>
                     <p>But if you value them and love them for <hi>themselves,</hi> they are now more <hi>lovely</hi> when they are more <hi>perfect;</hi> and they are now fitter for your content and joy, when they have themselves unchangeable content and joy, than they could be in their sin and sorrows.</p>
                     <p>But if you valued and loved them but for <hi>your selves only,</hi> it is just with God to take them from you, to teach you to value men to righter ends, and upon better considerations: and both to prefer God before your selves, and better to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the nature of true friendship, and better to know that your own felicity is not in the hands of any creature, but of God alone.</p>
                     <p>10. <hi>Did you improve your friends while you had them?</hi> or did you <hi>only Love them,</hi> while you made but little <hi>use of them</hi> for your souls? If you <hi>used</hi> them not, it was just with God for all <hi>your Love</hi> to take them from you. They were given you as your <hi>candle,</hi> not only to <hi>Love it,</hi> but to <hi>work by the Light</hi> of it: And as your <hi>garments;</hi> not only to <hi>Love them,</hi> but to <hi>wear them;</hi> and as your <hi>meat,</hi> not only to <hi>Love it,</hi> but to <hi>feed upon it.</hi> Did you receive their counsel, and hearken to their reproofs, and pray with them, and conser with them upon those holy truths that tended to elevate your minds to
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:59347:184"/>
God, and to inflame your brests, with sacred Love? If not, be it now known to you, that God gave you not such helps and mercies only to talk of, or look upon and Love, but also to improve for the benefit of your souls.</p>
                     <p>11. <hi>Do you not seem to forget both where you are your selves, and where you must shortly and for ever live?</hi> Where would you have your <hi>friends,</hi> but where you must be <hi>your selves?</hi> Do you mou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Why, if they had staid <hi>here</hi> a thousand years, how little of that time should you have had their company? when you are almost leaving the world <hi>your selves,</hi> would you not send your treasure before you to the place where you must abide? How quickly will you pass from hence to God, where you shall <hi>find your friends</hi> that you lamented as if they had been lost, and there shall dwell with them for ever! O foolish mourners! would you not have your friends at <hi>home!</hi> at <hi>their home</hi> and <hi>your home,</hi> with <hi>their Father</hi> and <hi>your Father; their God</hi> and <hi>your God!</hi> Shall you not there enjoy them long enough! Can you so much miss them for one day, that must live with them to all eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? And is not eternity long enough for you to enjoy your friends in?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Obj.</hi> But I do not know whether ever I shall there have any distinct knowledge of them, or love to them, and whether God shall not there be so far All in All, as that we shall need or fetch no comfort from the creature.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> There is no reason for either of these doubts. For, 1. You cannot justly think that the knowledge of the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified shall be more confused or imperfect then the knowledge of natural men on earth. We shall know <hi>much more,</hi> but not so <hi>much less.</hi> Heaven exceedeth earth in knowledge, as much as it doth in joy.</p>
                     <p>2. The Angels in Heaven have now a distinct particular knowledge of the least believers; rejoycing particularly in their conversion, and being called by Christ himself [<hi>Their Angels.</hi>] Therefore when we shall be <hi>equal to the Angels,</hi> we shall certainly know our nearest friends that there dwell with us, and are employed in the same attendance.</p>
                     <p>3. <hi>Abraham</hi> knew the Rich man in Hell, and the man knew <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Lazarus:</hi> Therefore we shall have as distinct a Knowledge.</p>

                        <pb n="332" facs="tcp:59347:185"/>4. The two Disciples Knew <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> in the mount, whom they had never seen before: Though it is possible Christ told them who they were, yet there is no such thing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed: and therefore it is as probable that they knew them by the communication of their irradiating glory.

                     <p>5. It is said expresly, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 10, 11, 12. that our <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent knowledge shall be done away</hi> only in regard of its <hi>imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection;</hi> and not of <hi>it self,</hi> which shall be perfected: [<hi>when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away:</hi>] As we put away <hi>childish thoughts and speeches,</hi> when we become men: The change will be from [<hi>seeing in a glass</hi>] to [<hi>seeing face to face</hi>] and from [<hi>knowing in part</hi>] to [<hi>knowing even as we are known.</hi>]</p>
                     <p>2. And that we shall both <hi>Know,</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>rejoyce</hi> in <hi>creatures</hi> even in Heaven, notwithstanding that God is all in all, appeareth further thus.</p>
                     <p>1. <hi>Christ</hi> in his glorified humanity is a <hi>Creature:</hi> and yet there is no doubt but all his members will there Know and Love him in his glorified humanity, without any derogation from the glory of the Deity.</p>
                     <p>2. The <hi>Body of Christ</hi> will continue its unity, and every <hi>member</hi> will be so nearly related, even in Heaven, that they cannot choose but <hi>Know</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> each other. Shall we be ignorant of the <hi>members of our Body?</hi> and not be concerned in their felicity with whom we are so nearly one?</p>
                     <p>3. The state and felicity of the Church hereafter, is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently described in Scripture as consistent in <hi>society.</hi> It is a <hi>Kingdom,</hi> the <hi>City of God,</hi> the <hi>Heavenly Jerusalem:</hi> and it is mentioned as part of our happiness to be of that <hi>society,</hi> Heb. 12. 22, 23, 24, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>4. The Saints are called <hi>Kings</hi> themselves: and it is said that they shall <hi>judge the world, and the Angels</hi> (And <hi>Judging</hi> in Scripture is frequently put for <hi>Governing) Therefore,</hi> (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there will be another world of moreals which they shall Govern as Angels now Govern <hi>men;</hi> or whether the Misery of damned men and Angels will partly consist in as base a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the glorified Saints, as dogs now have to men, or wicked reprobates on earth to Angels; or whether in respect
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:59347:185"/>
of <hi>both these</hi> together the Saints shall then be Kings, and Rule and Judge; or whether it be only the participation of the Glory of Christ, that is called a Kingdom, I will not here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, but) it is most clear that they will have a distinct particular <hi>Knowledge</hi> of the world, which they themselves must judge; and some concernment in that work.</p>
                     <p>5. It is put into the description of the Happiness of the Saints, that they shall come from the East, and from the West, and shall sit down with <hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God. Therefore they shall know them, and take some comfort in their presence.</p>
                     <p>6. <hi>Love</hi> (even to the <hi>Saints</hi> as well as <hi>unto God</hi>) is one of the graces that shall endure <hi>for ever,</hi> 1 Cor. 13. It is exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed upon an <hi>Immortal object</hi> (the Image and Children of the Most High) and therefore must be one of the <hi>Immortal Graces.</hi> For Grace in the <hi>Nature</hi> of it dyeth not: and therefore if the <hi>Object</hi> cease not, how should the <hi>Grace</hi> cease, unless you will call it's <hi>perfecting</hi> a <hi>ceasing?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is a state too high for such as we, and I think for any meer Creature to live so <hi>Immediately</hi> and <hi>only upon God,</hi> as to have no <hi>use</hi> for any fellow <hi>Creature,</hi> nor no comfort in them. God can make use of Glorified Creatures, in such subserviency and subordination to himself, as shall be no diminution to his All sufficiency or Honour, nor to our glory and felicity. We must take heeed of fancying even such a Heaven it self, as is above the capacity of a Creature; as some very wise Divines think they have done, that tell us we shall <hi>immediately see Gods Essence</hi> (his <hi>Glory</hi> being that which is provided for our <hi>intuition</hi> and felicity, and is distinct from his <hi>Essence;</hi> being not <hi>everywhere</hi> as his <hi>Essence</hi> is.) And as those do that tell us because that God will be <hi>All in All,</hi> therefore we shall there have none of our comfort by any creature. Though <hi>flesh and blood shall not enter into that Kingdom,</hi> but our <hi>Bodies</hi> will then be <hi>Spiritual Bodies;</hi> yet will they be really the same as now, and distinct from our souls: and therefore must have a felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty suitable to a <hi>Body</hi> glorified: And if the soul did <hi>immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> see <hi>Gods Essence,</hi> yet as no reason can conclude that it can see <hi>nothing else,</hi> or that it can see even <hi>Created Good,</hi> and <hi>not Love it,</hi> so the <hi>Body</hi> however must have objects and felicity fit for a Body.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> No doubt but all the carnality in <hi>principles, matter, manner</hi> and <hi>ends</hi> of our knowledge will then cease as it's imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: But that a <hi>carnal</hi> knowledge be turned into a <hi>spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,</hi> is no more a diminution to it, than it is to the glory of our <hi>Bodies,</hi> to be made like the stars in the Firmament of our Father.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Obj.</hi> But then I shall have no more comfort in my present friends than in any other.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. If you <hi>had</hi> none in them, it is no diminution to our happiness, if indeed we should have all in God immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately and alone. 2. But if you have as much in others that you never knew before, that will not diminish any of your comfort in your antient friends. 3. But it is most probable to us, that as there is a twofold object for our love in the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified Saints; one is their <hi>Holiness,</hi> and the other is the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> which they stood in between God and us, being made his instruments for our conversion and salvation, so that we shall <hi>Love Saints in Heaven</hi> in <hi>both</hi> respects: And in the first respect (which is the chiefest) we shall love those most that have most of God, and the greatest Glory (though such as we never knew on earth) And in the second respect we shall Love those most that were employed by God for our greatest good.</p>
                     <p>And that we shall not there lay by so much respect to <hi>our selves,</hi> as to forget or disregard out <hi>benefactours,</hi> is manifest, 1. In that we shall for ever <hi>remember Christ,</hi> and <hi>Love him,</hi> and <hi>Praise him,</hi> as one that <hi>formerly Redeemed us,</hi> and <hi>washed us in his blood, and hath made us Kings and Priests to God:</hi> And therefore we may also in <hi>just subordination to Christ,</hi> remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber them <hi>with Love and Thankfulness,</hi> that were his <hi>Instruments</hi> for the collation of these benefits.</p>
                     <p>2. And this kind of <hi>Self-Love</hi> (to be sensible of <hi>Good and Evil</hi> to our selves) is none of the <hi>sinful</hi> or <hi>imperfect selfishness</hi> to be renounced or laid by, but part of our very <hi>Natures,</hi> and as inseparable from us as we are from our selves.</p>
                     <p>Much more, were it not digressive, might be said on this subject; but I shall only add, that as God doth draw us to
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:59347:186"/>
every holy duty by shewing us the <hi>excellency</hi> of that duty; and as <hi>perpetuity</hi> is not the smallest <hi>excellency;</hi> so he hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely mentioned that <hi>Love endureth for ever</hi> (when he had described the <hi>Love of one another</hi>) as a principal motive to <hi>kindle and encrease this Love.</hi> And therefore those that think they shall have no <hi>personal Knowledge</hi> of one another, nor <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal Love</hi> to one another (for we cannot <hi>Love</hi> personally, if we <hi>know not</hi> personally) do take a most effectual course to destroy in their souls all holy special Love to Saints, by cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away that principal or very great motive given them by the Holy Ghost. I am not able to <hi>Love much</hi> where I fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>know that I shall not <hi>Love long.</hi> I cannot Love a comely Inne, so well as a nearer dwelling of my own, because I must be gone to morrow. Therefore must I love my <hi>Bible</hi> better than my <hi>Law books,</hi> or <hi>Physick books,</hi> &amp;c. because it leadeth to Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And therefore I must Love <hi>Holiness</hi> in my self and others, better than meat and drink, and wealth and honour, and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and pleasure; because it must be Loved for ever, when the Love of these must needs be transitory, as <hi>they</hi> are transitory. I must profess from the very experience of my soul, that it is the belief that I shall Love my friends in Heaven, that prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally kindleth my Love to them on Earth: And if I thought I should never know them after death, and consequently ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver love them more, when this life is ended, I should in reason number them with temporal things, and Love them compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively but a little; even as I Love other transitory things (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing for the excellency in the nature of Grace) But now I converse with some delight with my Godly friends, as believing I shall converse with them for ever, and take comfort in the very <hi>Dead</hi> and <hi>Absent,</hi> as believing we shall shortly <hi>meet in Heaven:</hi> and I Love them, I hope, with a Love that is of a <hi>Heavenly Nature,</hi> while I Love them as the <hi>Heirs of Heaven,</hi> with a Love which I expect shall there be perfected, and more <hi>fully</hi> and <hi>for ever</hi> exercised.</p>
                     <p>12. The last Reason that I give you, to move you to bear the <hi>Loss</hi> or <hi>Absence</hi> of your friends, is, that it gives you the loudest call to retire from all the world, and to converse with God himself, and to long for Heaven, where you shall be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from your friends no more. And your forsaken state
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:59347:187"/>
will somewhat assist you to that solitary converse with God, which it calls you to: But this brings us up to the third part of the Text.</p>

                     <p>He is not without company, that is with the King, though twenty others have turned him off. He is not without Light that hath the shining Sun, though all his Candles be put out. If God be our God, he is our All, and is enough for us: And if he be our All, we shall not much find the want of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures while he is with us.</p>
                     <p>For 1. He is <hi>with us,</hi> who is <hi>Everywhere,</hi> and therefore is never from us; and knoweth all the waies and projects of our enemies; being <hi>with them in wrath,</hi> as he is <hi>with us in mercy.</hi>

                     <p>2. He is <hi>with us</hi> who is <hi>Almighty,</hi> sufficient to preserve us, conquerable by none; and therefore while he is with us, we need not fear what man can do unto us: For they can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what he will: No danger, no sickness, no trouble or want can be so great as to make it any difficulty to God to deliver us when and how he please.</p>
                     <p>3. He is with us who is <hi>Infinitely wise,</hi> and therefore we need not fear the subtilty of enemies; nor shall any of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken works for his Church or us miscarry for want of foresight, or through any oversight. We shall be preserved even from our own <hi>Folly,</hi> as well as from our Enemies subtilty: For it is not our own wisdome that our greatest concernments do principally rest upon, nor that our safety and peace are chiefly secured by; but it is the Wisdome of our great Preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. He knoweth what to do with us, and what paths to lead us in, and what is best for us in all conditions. And he hath promised to Teach us, and will be our sure infallible Guide.</p>
                     <p>4. He is with us who is <hi>Infinitely Good,</hi> and therefore is only sit to be a continual delight and satisfaction to our souls: that hath nothing in him to disaffect us, or discourage us: whom

we may love without fear of overloving; and need not set any bounds to our Love, the object of it being infinite.</p>
                     <p>5. He is <hi>with us,</hi> who is most nearly related to us, and most dearly loveth us; and therefore will never be wanting to us in any thing that is fit for us to have. This is he that is <hi>with us,</hi> when all have left us, and as to man we are alone; and therefore we may well say that we are not alone. Of this I shall say more anon in the application.</p>

When <hi>we awake, we</hi> should <hi>be still with him:</hi> When we go abroad we should be alwaies as before him: Our life and works should be a <hi>Walking with God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. He is alwaies <hi>with us efficiently</hi> to <hi>do us Good;</hi> Though we have none else that <hi>careth</hi> for us, yet will he never cast us out of his care, but biddeth us cast <hi>our care on him,</hi> as promising that he will <hi>care for us.</hi> Though we have none else to <hi>provide</hi> for us, he is alwiaes with us, and our Father knoweth what we want, and will make the best provision for us, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 32, 33. Though we have none else to defend us against the power of our enemies, he is alwaies <hi>with us</hi> to be our sure defence: He is the Rock to which we fly, and upon which we are surely built. He gathereth us to himself as the Hen gathereth her Chickens under her wings, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 37.

Though we may have none else to strengthen and help us, and support us in our weakness, yet he is alwaies with us, whose Grace is sufficient for us, to manifest his strength in weakness.

He never need to want matter for his meditation, that hath God to meditate on. He need not want matter of discourse (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mental or vocal) that hath God to talk of, though he have not the name of any other friend to mention. All our Affections may have in him the highest and most pleasant work. The soul of man cannot have a more sweet and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent work than to Love him: He wanteth neither work nor pleasure, that in his solitude is taken up in the believing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations of Eternal Love, and of all his blessed Attributes and works.

Indeed so much <hi>of God</hi> as appears in men, so much is their converse excellent and delightful: and theirs is the best that have most of God: But there is so much of vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and self, and flesh, and sin in the most or all of us, as very much darkneth our Light, and dampeth the pleasure, and blasteth the fruit of our societies and converse. O how oft have I been solaced in God, when I found nothing but deceit and darkness in the world! How oft hath he comforted me, when it was past the power of man! How oft hath he relieved and delivered me, when all the help of man was vain! It hath been my <hi>Stay</hi> and <hi>Rest,</hi> to look to him, when the creature hath been a broken staff, and deceitful friends have been but as a broken tooth, or a foot that is out of joynt (as <hi>Solomon</hi> speaketh of confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble, <hi>Prov.</hi> 25. 29.) Verily as the world were but an horrid dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon without the Sun, so it were a howling wilderness, a place of no considerable employment or delight, were it not that in it we may live to God and do him service, and sometime be refreshed with the light of his countenance, and the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of his Love.

so great a benefit as a godly friend: nor for the neglect of your duty in improving the company and help of friends: Two is better then one: The communion of Saints, and help of those that are wise and faithful, is a mercy highly to be esteemed. And the undervaluing of it, is at least a sign of a declining soul.</p>
                     <p>2. You must not hence fetch any pretence to slight your friends, and disoblige them, or neglect any duty that you owe them, or any means therein necessary to the continuation of their friendship.</p>
                     <p>3. You must not causelesly withdraw from humane society into <hi>Solitude.</hi> A weariness of converse with men, is oft con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct with a weariness of our duty: And a retiring volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily into solitude, when God doth not call or drive us thither, is oft but a retiring from the place and work which God hath appointed us: And consequently a retiring rather from God, than to God. Like some idle servants, that think they should not work so hard, because it is but <hi>Worldly business,</hi> and think their Masters deal not <hi>Religiously</hi> by them, unless they let them neglect their labour, that they may spend more time in serving God: as if it were no serving God to be faithful in their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters service.</p>

                     <p>3. In case he hath committed a sin so heinous and of inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible scandal and reproach, as that it is not fit for the servants of Christ any more to receive him into their local commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, though he repent: (For as to <hi>Local communion,</hi> I think, such a case may be.)</p>
                     <p>4. In case a man through custome and ill company be so captivated to some fleshly lust, as that he is not able to <hi>bear the temptations</hi> that are <hi>found in humane converse;</hi> but falleth by them into frequent heinous sinning: In this case the right hand
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:59347:190"/>
or eye is rather to be parted with, than their salvation. And though a meer restraint by distance of temptations and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of sinning, will not prove a man sanctified, nor save the soul that loveth the sin and fain would live in it; Yet, 1. Grace may sometime appear in the strength and self-denyal which is exercised in the very avoiding of temptations, when yet perhaps the person hath not strength enough to have stood against the temptation if it had not been avoided. And, 2. The distance of temptations, and opportunity of serious and frequent consideration, may be a means to help them to sincerity that want it.</p>
                     <p>5. In case a man by <hi>age</hi> or <hi>sickness</hi> find himself so <hi>near to death,</hi> as that he hath now a more <hi>special call</hi> to look after his <hi>present actual preparation,</hi> than to endeavour any more the <hi>good of others;</hi> and find withall, that <hi>solitude</hi> will help him in his <hi>preparations,</hi> his society being such as would but hinder him.

                     </p>
                     <p>But when there is no such necessity or call, it usually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from one of these vicious distempers: 1. From <hi>Cowardize</hi> and fear of suffering, when the souldiers of Christ do hide their heads, instead of confessing him before men.</p>
                     <p>2. From a laziness of minde and weariness of duty: when slothful unprofitable servants hide their talents, pretending their fear of the austerity of their Lord. Its easier to <hi>run away from our work,</hi> then <hi>do it:</hi> and to go out of the reach of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, malice, contradiction and ungodliness, than to <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter them,</hi> and <hi>conquer them</hi> by Truth and Holy lives. So many persons as we converse with, so many are there to whom we owe some duty: And this is not so easie as it is to over-run our work, and to hide our selves in some Wilderness or Cell, whilst others are fighting the battels of the Lord. 3. Or it may proceed from meer <hi>impatience:</hi> When men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cannot bear the frown, and scorns, and violence of the ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they fly from sufferings, which by patience they should overcome. 4. Or it may come from <hi>humour</hi> and <hi>mutability</hi> of mind, and discontent with ones condition: Many retire from humane converse to please a <hi>discontented</hi> passionate mind; or expecting to finde that in privacy, which in publick they could
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:59347:191"/>
not find, nor is anywhere to be found on earth. 5. And some do it in <hi>Melancholy,</hi> meerly to please a <hi>sick imagination,</hi> which is vexed in company, and a little easeth it self in living as the possessed man among the Tombs. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>. And sometimes it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from <hi>self-ignorance,</hi> and an <hi>unhumbled state</hi> of a soul: When men think much better of themselves than others, they think they can more comfortably converse with <hi>themselves</hi> than with <hi>others:</hi> Whereas if they well understood that they are the <hi>worst</hi> or <hi>greatest enemies,</hi> or <hi>troubles</hi> to themselves, they would more fear their own company than other mens: They would then consider what proud, and fleshly, and worldly, and selfish, and disordered hearts they are like to carry with them into their solitude, and there to be annoyed with from day to day: And that the <hi>nearest</hi> enemy is the worst, and the <hi>nearest</hi> trouble is the greatest.</p>
                     <p>These <hi>vices</hi> or <hi>infirmities</hi> carry many into solitude; and if they live where Popish vanity may seduce them, they will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps imagine, that they are <hi>serving God,</hi> and entring into <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</hi> when they are but <hi>sinfully</hi> obeying their <hi>corruptions:</hi> and that they are advanced above others in degrees of grace, while they are pleasing a diseased fancy, and entring into a dangerous course of sin. No doubt but the duties of a publick life are more in number, and greater in weight, and of more excellent consequence and tendency (even to the most pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick good, and greatest honour of God) than the duties of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacy or retirement. <hi>Vir bonus est commune bonum:</hi> A good man is a common good. And (saith <hi>Seneca) Nulla essent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munia nisi pars illorum pertineret ad singulos</hi>] If every one have not some share or interest in them, how are they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon?

                     <p>1. You less contribute to the <hi>honour of your Redeemer,</hi> and less promote his Kingdom in the world, and less subserve his death and office, while you do good but to few, and live but <hi>almost to your selves.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. You live in the <hi>poorest exercise</hi> of the grace of <hi>Charity;</hi> and therefore in a low undesirable condition.</p>
                     <p>3. You will want the communion of Saints, and benefit of publick ordinances (for I account not a <hi>Colledge</hi> life a <hi>Solitary</hi>

                     <p>4. It will be a life of smaller comfort, as it is a life of smaller benefit to others.

                     <p>I Shall now come to the <hi>Affirmative,</hi> and tell you for all this, that [<hi>If God call us into Solitude, or men forsake us, we may rejoyce in this, that we are not alone, but the Father is with us.] Fear not</hi> such <hi>Solitude,</hi> but be ready to improve it, if you be cast upon it. If God be your God, reconciled to you in Christ, and his Spirit be in you, you are provided for Solitude, and need not fear if all the world should cast you off. If you be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, imprisoned, or left alone, it is but a Relaxation from your greatest labours; which though you may not cast off your selves, you may lawfully be sensible of your ease, if God take off your burden. It is but a cessation from your sharpest conflicts, and removal from a multitude of great temptations. And though you may not cowardly retreat or shift your selves from the sight and danger, yet if God will dispense with you, and let you live in greater peace and safety, you have no cause to murmure at his dealing. A fruit tree that groweth by the high-way side, doth seldome keep its fruit to ripeness, while so many passengers have each his stone or cudgel to cast at it: <hi>Seneca</hi> could say [<hi>Nunquam a turba mores quos extuli refero: Aliquid ex eo quod composui turbatur; aliquid ex his quae fuga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi redit: inimica est multorum conversatio] I never bring home well from a crowd the manners which I took out with me: some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is disordered of that which I had set in order: something of that which I had banished doth return: the conversation of many I find an enemy to me.</hi>] O how many vain and foolish words corrupt the minds of those that converse with an ungodly world, when your ears and minds who live in Solitude, are free from such temptations! You live not in so corrupt an Air as they: You hear not the filthy ribbald speeches, which fight against modesty and chastity, and are the bellows of lust: You
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:59347:193"/>
hear not the discontented complaining words of the impatient; nor the passionate provoking words of the offended; nor the wrangling quarrelsome words of the contentious; nor the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorious, or slanderous, or reproachful words of the malicious, who think it their interest to have their brethren taken to be bad, and to have others hate them, because they themselves hate them; and who are as zealous to quench the charity of others, when it is destroyed in themselves, as holy persons are zealous to provoke others to Love, which dwelleth and ruleth in themselves. In your Solitude with God, you shall not hear the lyes and malicious revilings of the ungodly against the generation of the just: nor the subtile cheating words of Hetericks, who being themselves deceived, would deceive others of their faith, and corrupt their lives. You shall not there be distracted with the noise and clamours of contending uncharitable professors of Religion, endeavouring to make odious first the opinions, and then the persons of one another: one saying, Here is the Church, and another, There is the Church: one saying, This is the true Church Government, and another saying, Nay, but that is it: One saying, God will be worshipped thus, and another, Not so, but thus or thus: You shall not there be drawn to side with one against another, nor to joyn with any faction, or be guilty of divisions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> You shall not be troubled with the oaths and blasphemies of the wicked, nor with the imprudent miscarriages of the weak; with the persecutions of enemies, or the falling out of friends: You shall not see the cruelty of proud oppressors, that set up lyes by armed violence, and care not what they say or do, nor how much other men are injured or suffer, so that themselves may tyrannize, and their wills and words may rule the world, when they do so unhappily rule themselves. In your Solitude with God, you shall not see the prosperity of the wicked to move you to envy, nor the adversity of the just to be your grief: You shall see no worldly pomp and splendour to besool you; nor adorned beauty to entice you, nor wasting calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to afflict you: You shall not hear the laughter of fools, nor the sick mans groans, nor the wronged mans complaints, nor the poor mans murmurings, nor the proud mans boastings, nor the angry mans abusive ragings.

As you lose the help of your gracious friends, so you are freed from the fruits of their peevishness and passions; of their differing opinions and wayes and tempers; of their inequality, unsuitableness, and contrariety of minds or interests; of their levity and unconstancy, and the powerful temptations of their friendship, to draw you to the errors or other sins which they are tainted with themselves. In a word, you are there half delivered from the VANITY and VEXATION of the world; and were it not that you are yet undelivered from <hi>your selves,</hi> and that you take distempered corrupted hearts with you, O what a felicity would your solitude be! But, alas, we cannot overrun our own diseases, we must carry with us the remnants of our corrupted nature; our deadness, and dulness, our selfishness and earthly minds, our impatience and discontents; and worst of all, our lamentable weakness of faith and love and heavenly mindedness, and our strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to God, and backwardness to the matters of eternal life. O that I could escape these, though I were in the hands of the cruellest enemies! O that such a heart could be left behind! How gladly would I overrun both house, and land, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and all sensual delights, that I might but overrun it! O where is the place where there is none of this darkness, nor disaffection, nor distance, nor estrangedness from God! O that I knew it! O that I could find it! O that I might there dwell! though I should never more see the face of mortals; nor ever hear a humane voice, nor ever tast of the delights of flesh! Alas, foolish soul! such a place there is, that hath all this and more than this: but it is not in a wilderness, but in Paradise, not here on earth, but above with Christ! And yet am I so loth to die? yet am I no more desirous of the blessed day, when I shall be unclothed of flesh and sin? O death, what an enemy art thou even to my soul! By affrighting me from the presence of my Lord, and hindering my desires and willingness to be gone, thou wrongest me much more, than by laying my flesh to rot in darkness. Fain I would know God, and fain I would more love him and enjoy him: but O this hurtful love of life! O this unreasonable fear of dying, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth my desires from pressing on to the happy place where all this may be had! O wretched man that I am, who shall
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:59347:194"/>
deliver me from this body of death! this carnal unbelieving heart, that sometime can think more delightfully of a <hi>Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> then of <hi>Heaven;</hi> that can go seek after God in desert solitude, among the birds and beasts and trees, and yet is so backward to be loosed from flesh that I may find him and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy him in the world of glory! Can I expect that heaven come down to earth! and that the Lord of Glory should remove his Court, and either leave the retinue of his celestial Courtiers, or bring them all down into this drossy world of flesh and sin, and this to satisfie my fleshly foolish mind! Or can I expect the translation of <hi>Henoch</hi> or the Chariot of <hi>Elias?</hi> Is it not enough that my Lord hath conquered Death, and sanctified the passage, and prepared the place of my perpetual abode!</p>
                     <p>Well! for all this, though a <hi>Wilderness</hi> is <hi>not Heaven,</hi> it shall be sweet and wellcome for the <hi>sake</hi> of Heaven, if <hi>thence</hi> I may but have a clearer prospect of it: and if by retiring from the crowd and noise of folly I may but be more composed and better disposed to converse above, and to use my faith (alas, my too weak languid faith) untill the beatifical vision and fruition come. If there may be but more of God, or readier access to him, or more heart-quickening flames of Love, or more heart-comforting intimations of his favour, in a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness then in a City, in a prison then in a Palace, let that wilderness be my City, and let that prison be my Palace, while I must abide on earth. If in solitude I may have <hi>Henochs</hi> walk with God, I shall in due season have such a translation as shall bring me to the same felicity which he enjoyeth: and in the mean time as well as after, it is no incommodity, if by mortal eyes I be seen no more. If the Chariot of contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation will in solitude raise me to more believing affectionate converse with heaven, than I could expect in tumults and temptations, it shall reconcile me unto solitude, and make it my Paradise on earth, till Angels instead of the Chariot of <hi>Elias,</hi> shall convey me to the presence of my glorified Head, in the Celestial Paradise.</p>

reconciled to me. I shall not miss the light of the Candle, if I have this blessed Sun. The Creature <hi>is nothing</hi> but what it is <hi>from</hi> God, and <hi>in</hi> God: And it is worth nothing, or good for nothing, but what it's worth in order unto God, as it decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth him, and helps the soul to know him, serve him, or draw nearer to him: As it is Idolatry in the unhappy worldling, to thirst after the Creature with the neglect of God, and so to make the world his God; so doth it savour of the same hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous sin to lament our loss of Creatures more than the displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of God. If God be my enemy, or I am fallen under his indignation, I have then so much greater matters to lament than the loss, or absence, or frowns of man, as should almost make me forget that there is such a thing as man to be regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: But if God be my Father, and my friend in Christ, I have then so much to think of with delight, and to recreate and content my soul, as will proclaim it most incongruous and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd to lament inordinately the absence of a worm, while I have his Love and presence who is All in All.

O my dear Lord, hide not <hi>thou</hi> thy face from an unkind an unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy sinner! Let me but dwell with thee and see thy face, and feel the gracious embracements of thy Love, and then let me be cast off by all the world, if thou see it meetest for me; or let all other friends be where they will, so that my soul may be with thee: I have agreed for thy sake to forsake all, even the dearest that shall stand against thee; and I resolve by thy grace to stand to this agreement.</p>
                     <p>3. <hi>If God be with me I am not alone, for he is with me that Loveth me best.</hi>] The Love of all the friends on earth is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to his Love. O how plainly hath he declared that he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth me, in the strange condescention, the sufferings, death, and intercession of his Son? What Love hath he declared in the communications of his Spirit, and the operations of his Grace, and the near relations into which he brought me? What Love hath he declared in in the course of his providences? in many and wonderful preservations and deliverances? in the conduct of his wisdome, and in a life of mercies? What Love appeareth in his precious promises, and the glorious provisions he hath made for me with himself to all eternity? O my Lord, I am ashamed that thy Love is so much lost; that it hath no better return from an unkind unthankful heart; that I am not more delighted in thee, and swallowed up in the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thy Love; I can contentedly let go the society and converse of all others, for the converse of some one bosome friend, that is dearer to me than they all, as <hi>Jonathan</hi> to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid:</hi> And can I not much more be satisfied in thee alone, and let go all if I may continue with thee? My very Dog will glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for sake all the Town, and all persons in the world, to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me alone! And have I not yet found so much Love and Goodness in thee my dear and blessed God, as to be willing to
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:59347:196"/>
converse alone with thee? All men delight most in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of those that Love them best: They choose not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse with the <hi>Multitude</hi> when they look for solace and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, but with their dearest friends: And should any be so dear to me as God? O were not thy Love unworthily neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected by an unthankful heart, I should never be so unsatisfied in thee, but should take up, or seek my comforts in thee: I should then say, Whom have I in Heaven but thee, and there is none on earth that I desire besides thee! Though not only my friends, but my flesh and heart themselves should fail me, it is thou that will still be the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever: it is good therefore for me to draw near to thee, how far soever I am from man: O let me there dwell where thou wilt not be strange, for thy loving kindness is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than life: instead of the multitude of my turmoiling thoughts, let me be taken up in the believing views of thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled face, and in the glad attendance upon thy Grace: or at least in the multitude of my thoughts within me, let thy ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial comforts delight my soul. Let me dwell as in thy family; and when I awake, let me be still with thee! Let me go no whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but where I am still following thee: Let me do nothing but thy work, nor serve any other but when I may truly call it a serving thee: Let me hear nothing but thy voice, and let me know thy voice by whatever instrument thou shalt speak: Let me never see any thing but thy self and the glass that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenteth thee, and the books in which I may read thy name: And let me never play with the outside, and gaze on words and letters as insignificant, and not observe thy name which is the sense. Whether it be in company or in solitude, let me be continually with thee, and do thou vouchsafe to hold me by my right hand: And guide me with thy counsel, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards receive me unto thy glory, <hi>Psal.</hi> 73. 23, 24, 25, 26, 28. <hi>Psal.</hi> 63. 3.</p>
                     <p>4. If God be with me I am not alone; for <hi>I shall be with him whose Love is of greater use and benefit to me, than the Love of all my friends in the world. Their Love</hi> may perhaps be some little comfort, as it floweth from <hi>His:</hi> But it is <hi>His Love</hi> by which and upon which I Live. It is His Love that gives me <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Time,</hi> and <hi>health</hi> and <hi>food,</hi> and preservation; that
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:59347:196"/>
gives me books and giveth me understanding: that giveth me provision, and saveth me from turning it to pernicious flesh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness and excess; that giveth me even my friends themselves, and saveth me from that abuse which might make them to me worse than enemies. The Sun, the Earth, the Air is not so useful or needful to me as his Love. The Love of all my friends cannot make me well when I am sick: it cannot forgive the smallest of my sins; nor yet assure me of Gods forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: it cannot heal the maladies of my soul, nor give a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid lasting peace to the conscience which is troubled: if all my friends stand about me when I am dying, they cannot take away the fears of death, nor secure my passage to everlasting life: Death will be Death still, and danger will be danger, when all my friends have done their best. But my Almighty friend is Allsufficient: He can prevent my sickness, or rebuke and cure it, or make it so good to me, that I shall thank him for it: He can blot out my transgressions, and forgive all my sin; and justifie me when the world and my conscience do condemn me: He can teach me to believe, to repent, to pray, to hope, to suffer, and to overcome: He can quiet my soul in the midst of trouble, and give me a well grounded everlasting peace, and a joy which no man can take from me. He can deliver me from all the corruptions and distempers of my fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward heart; and ease me and secure me in the troublesome war which is daily managed in my breast. He can make it as easie a thing to dye, as to lye down and take my rest when I am weary, or to undress me at night and go to bed. He can teach Death to lay by its terrible aspect, and to speak with a mild and comfortable voice, and to bring me the joyfullest ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings that ever came unto my ears; and to preach to me the last and sweetest Sermon, even the same that our Saviour preached on the Cross [<hi>Luke</hi> 23. 43. <hi>Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with Christ in Paradise.</hi>]</p>
                     <p>And is this the difference between the <hi>Love of man</hi> and of <hi>God?</hi> And yet do I lament the <hi>loss of man!</hi> And yet am I so backward to converse with God, and to be satisfied in his Love alone! Ah my God, how justly mayest thou withhold that Love which I thus undervalue; and refuse that converse which I have first refused? and turn me over to man, to silly
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:59347:197"/>
man, to sinful man, whose converse I so much desire, till I have learnt by dear experience the difference between man and God, and between an Earthly and an Heavenly friend! Alas, have I not tryed it oft enough, to have known it better before this day! Have I not oft enough sound what man is in a time of tryal! Have I not been told it over and over, and told it to the quick, by deceitful friends, by self-seeking friends, by mutable, erroneous, deceived, scandalous, back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sliding friends, by proud and selfconceited friends; by passionate, quarrelsome, vexatious friends, by self-grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving troubled friends that have but brought me all their calamities and griefs to be additions to my own; by tempting friends, that have drawn me to sin more effectually than ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; by tender, faithful, but unable friends, rhat have but fetcht fire from my calamities and sorrows to kindle their own, not equally sharing, but each one taking all my trouble en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to himself: that have been <hi>willing,</hi> but <hi>insufficient</hi> to relieve me; and therefore the greater was their Love, the greater was their <hi>own,</hi> and consequently <hi>mine</hi> affliction: that would have been with me, but could not; that would fain have eased my pain, and strengthened my languishing body, but could not; that would fain have removed all my troubles, and comforted my cast-down mind, but could not. O how often have I found that humane friendship is a sweet desired addition to our woe; a beloved calamity, and an affliction which nature will not be without, not because it <hi>Loveth evil,</hi> nor because it is <hi>wholly deceived</hi> in its <hi>choice</hi> (for there is <hi>Good</hi> in <hi>friendship,</hi> and <hi>delight</hi> in holy <hi>Love</hi>) but because the <hi>Good</hi> which is here accompanied with so <hi>much evil,</hi> is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of a more high and durable friendship, and pointeth us up to the blessed delightful society and converse which in the heavenly <hi>Jerusalem</hi> we shall have with Christ!</p>
                     <p>But O how much better have I found the friendship of the Allsufficient God! His Love hath not only <hi>pittied me,</hi> but <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved me:</hi> He hath not only been as it were <hi>afflicted with me</hi> in my afflictions, but he hath delivered me seasonably, and powerfully, and sweetly hath he delivered me: And when he had once told me that my afflictions <hi>were his own,</hi> I had no reason to doubt of a deliverance. My burdened mind hath
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:59347:197"/>
been eased by his Love, which was but more burdened by the fruitless Love of all my friends. Oft have I come to man for help, and ease, and comfort, and gone away as from an empty Cistern, that had no water to cool my thirst; but God hath been a present help: Could I but <hi>get near him,</hi> I was sure of Light, how great soever was my former darkness: Could I but <hi>get near him,</hi> I was sure of warming quickning Life, how dead soever I had been before: But all my misery was that I could not <hi>get near him!</hi> My darkened estranged guilty soul, could not get quieting and satisfying acquaintance: My lumpish heart lay dead on earth, and would not stir, or quickly fell down again, if by any celestial force it began to be drawn up, and move a little towards him: My carnal mind was entang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in diverting vanities: And thus I have been kept from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with my God. Kept! not by force or humane tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; not by bars or bolts, or distance of a place, or by the lowness of my condition; nor by any misrepresentations or reproach of man; but, alas, by my self, by the darkness and deadness, aad sluggishness, and earthliness, and fleshliness, and passions of a naughty heart. These have been my bars, and bolts, and jaylors; These are they that have kept me from my God: Had it not been for these I might have got <hi>nearer</hi> to him; I might have walkt with him, and dwelt with him; yea <hi>dwelt in him, and he in me:</hi> and then I should not have mist any friends, nor felt mine enemies: And is it my sinful di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from my God that hath been my loss, my wilderness, my woe! And is it a nearer admittance to the presence of his Love that must be my recovery and my joy, if ever I attain to joy! O then my soul, lay hold on Christ the Reconciler, and in him and by him draw near to God: and cease from man whose breath is in his nostrils: Love God in his Saints, and delightfully converse with Christ in them, while thou hast op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity. But remember thou Livest not upon them, or on their Love, but upon God: and therefore desire <hi>their Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> but for <hi>His:</hi> and if thou have <hi>His,</hi> be content if thou have not <hi>theirs.</hi> He wants not man that enjoyeth God.

                     <p>5. <hi>If God be with me, I am not alone, because he is with me with whom my greatest business lyeth:</hi> And what company should I desire, but theirs with whom I have my daily necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry work to do? I have more to do with God, than with all the world: Yea more and greater business with him in one day, than with all the world in all my life. I have business with man about house, or lands, or food, or rayment, or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, or journying, or recreations, about society and publick peace: But what are these to my business with God!

Indeed my business with God is so great, that if I had not a Mediatour to encourage and assist me, to do my work and procure me acceptance, the thoughts of it would overwhelm my soul.</p>
                     <p>O therefore my soul, let man stand by: It is the Eternal God that I have to do with: and with whom I am to transact in this little time the business of my endless life. I have to deal with God through Christ, for the pardon of my sins, of all my great and grievous sins; and wo to me if I speed not that ever I was born: I have some hopes of pardon, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixt with many perplexing fears: I have evidences much blotted, and not easily understood: I want assurance that he is indeed my Father and reconciled to me, and will receive me to himself when the world forsaketh me: I have many languish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing graces to be strengthened; and alas, what radicated, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate, vexatious corruptions to be cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Can I look into my heart, into such an unbelieving, dead, and earthly heart, into such a proud, and peevish and disordered heart, into such a trembling, perplexed, self-accusing heart, and yet not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand how great my business is with God! Can I peruse my sins, or feel my wants, and sink under my weaknesses, and yet not discern how great my business is with God! Can I look back upon all the time that I have lost, and all the grace that I unthankfully resisted, and all the mercies that I trod under foot,
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:59347:198"/>
or fool'd away, and can I look before me and see how near my time is to an end, and yet not understand how great my busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is with God! Can I think of the malice and diligence of Satan, the number, power and subtilty of mine enemies, the many snares and dangers that are still before me, the strength and number of temptations, and my ignorance, unwatchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and weakness to resist, and yet not know that my greatest business is with God! Can I feel my afflictions and lament them, and think my burden greater then I can bear, and find that man cannot relieve me; can I go mourning in the heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of my soul, and water my bed with tears, and fill the air with my groans and lamentations, or feel my soul over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm'd within me, so that my words are intercepted, and I am readier to break then speak, and yet not perceive that my greatest business is with God? Can I think of dying? Can I draw near to judgement? Can I think of everlasting joyes in Heaven? and of everlasting pains in Hell, and yet not <hi>feel</hi> that my greatest business is with God? O then, my soul, the case is easily resolved, with whom it is that thou must most desirously and seriously converse. Where shouldst thou be but where thy business is, and so great business! Alas, what have I to do with man! what can it do but make my head ake, to hear a deal of sensless chat, about preferments, lands and dignities; about the words and thoughts of men, and a thousand toyes that are utterly impertinent to my great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, and signifie nothing but that the dreaming world is not awake! What pleasure is it to see the bussles of a Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam world? what a stir they make to <hi>prove</hi> or <hi>make</hi> themselves unhappy? How low and of how little weight, are the learned discourses about syllables and words, and names and notions, and mood and figure, yea or about the highest planets, when all are not referred unto God? Were it not that some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse with men, doth further my converse with God; and that God did transact much of his business by his messengers and servants, it were no matter whether ever I more saw the face of man: were it not that my Master hath placed me in society, and appointed me much of my <hi>work for</hi> others, and <hi>with</hi> others, and much of his <hi>mercy</hi> is conveyed <hi>by</hi> others, man might stand by, and solitude were better then the best society<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        <pb n="360" facs="tcp:59347:199"/>
and God alone should take me up. O nothing is so much my misery and shame, as that I am no more willing, nor better skilled in the management of my great important business! That my work is with God, and my heart is no more with him! O what might I do in holy meditation, or Prayer one hour, if I were as ready for prayer, and as good at prayer, as one that hath so long opportunity and so great necessity to converse with God, should be! A prayerless heart, a heart that flyeth away from God, is most unexcusable in such a one as I, that hath so much important business with him: It is work that must be done; and if well done, will never be repented of: I use not to return from the presence of God (when indeed I have drawn near him) as I do from the company of empty men, repenting that I have lost my time, and trembled that my mind is discomposed or depressed by the vanity and earthly savour of their discourse: I oft repent that I have prayed to him so <hi>coldly,</hi> and conversed with him so <hi>negligently,</hi> and served him so <hi>remisly;</hi> but I never repent of the <hi>time,</hi> the <hi>care,</hi> the <hi>affections</hi> or the <hi>diligence</hi> imployed in his holy work. Many a time I have repented that ever I spent so much time with <hi>man,</hi> and wisht I had never seen the faces of some that are eminent in the world, whose favour and converse others are ambitious of: But it is my grief and shame that so small a part of all my life, hath been spent with God; and that fervent prayer and heavenly contemplations, have been so seldom and so short. O that I had lived more with God, though I had been less with the dearest of my friends! How much more sweet then would my life have been! How much more blameless, regular and pure! How much more fruitful, and answerable to my obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations and professions! How much more comfortable to my review! How many falls, and hurts, and wounds, and griefs, and groans might I have escaped! O how much more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing is it <hi>now</hi> to my Rememberance, to think of the hours in which I have lain at the feet of God, though it were in tears and groans, than to think of the time which I have spent in any common converse with the greatest, or the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edest, or the dearest of my acquaintance!</p>
                     <p>And as my <hi>Greatest business</hi> is with God, so my <hi>daily busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> is also with him: He purposely leaveth me under wants,
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:59347:199"/>
and suffers necessities daily to return, and enemies to assault me, and affliction to surprize me, that I may be daily driven to him: He loveth to hear from me: He would have me be no stranger with him: I have business with him every hour, I need not want employment for all the faculties of my soul, if I know what it is to converse in Heaven. Even prayer, and every holy thought of God, hath an Object so great and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, as should wholly take me up. Nothing must he thought or spoken lightly about the Lord. His name must not be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in vain: Nothing that is common beseemeth his worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers. He will be sanctified of all that shall draw near him: He must be Loved with all the Heart and Might. His servants need not be wearied for want of employment, nor through the lightness or unprofitableness of their employment: If I had Cities to build, or Kingdoms to govern, I might better complain for want of employment for the faculties of my soul, than I can when I am to converse in Heaven. In other stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies the delight abateth when I have reached my desire, and know all that I can know: But in God there is infinitely more to be known when I know the most. I am never <hi>satiated</hi> with the <hi>easiness</hi> of knowing, nor are my desires <hi>abated</hi> by any <hi>unusefulness</hi> or <hi>unworthiness</hi> in the Object; but I am drawn to it by its highest excellencies, and drawn on to desire more and more by the infiniteness of the Light which I have not yet beheld, and the infiniteness of the Good which yet I have not enjoyed. If I be idle, or seem to want employment, when I am to contemplate all the Artributes, relations, mercies, works, and revealed perfections of the Lord, its sure for want of eyes to see, or a Heart enclined to my business: if God be not enough to employ my soul, then all the persons and things on earth are not enough.</p>
                     <p>And when I have <hi>Infinite Goodness</hi> to delight in, where my soul may freely let out it self, and never need to fear excess of Love, how sweet should this employment be? As <hi>Knowledge,</hi> so <hi>Love</hi> is never stinted here, by the narrowness of the Object: We can never Love him in any proportion either to his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and amiableness in himself, or to his Love to us. What need have I then of any other company or business, when I have infinite Goodness to delight in, and to Love (further than
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:59347:200"/>
they subserve this greatest work?)</p>
                     <p>Come home then, O my soul, to God: Converse in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: Turn away thine eyes from beholding vanity: Let not thy affections kindle upon straw or bryars, that go out when they have made a flash or noise, and leave thee to thy cold and darkness: But come and dwell upon celestial beauties, and make it thy daily and most diligent work, to kindle thy affections on the infinite everlasting Good; and then they will never be extinguished or decay for want of fewel; but the further they go, and the longer they burn, the greater will be the flame. Though thou find it hard while Love is but a spark to make it burn, and complain that thy cold and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward heart is hardly warmed with the Love of God, yet when the whole pile hath taken fire, and the flame ascendeth, fire will breed fire, Love will cause Love; and all the malice of Hell it self shall never be able to suppress or quench it unto all eternity.</p>
                     <p>6. And it is a great encouragement to my converse with God, that no misunderstanding, no malice of enemies, no for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer sin or present frailty, no nor the infinite distance of the most Holy Glorious God, can hinder my access to him, or turn away his Ear or Love, or interrupt my leave and liberty of converse. If I converse with the poor, their wants afflict me, being greater than I can supply: Their complaints and expectations which I cannot satisfie, are my trouble. If I would converse with Great ones, it is not easie to get access: and less easie to have their favout, unless I would purchase it at too dear a rate: How strangely and contemptuously do they look at their inferiours! Great friends must be made for a word or smile: And if you be not quickly gone, they are aweary of you: And if you seek any thing of them, or would put them to any cost or trouble, you are as welcome to them as so many vermine or noisome creatures. They please them best that drive you away. With how much labour and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty must you clime, if you will see the top of one of these mountains? And when you are there, you are but in a place of barrenness, and have nothing to satisfie you for your pains, but a larger prospect and vertiginous despect of the lower grounds which are not your own: it is seldome that
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:59347:200"/>
these Great ones are to be spoken with: And perhaps their speech is but a denyal of your requests, if not some snappish and contemptuous rejection, that makes you glad when you are got far enough from them, and makes you the better like and love the accessible, calm and fruitful plains.</p>
                     <p>But O how much greater encouragements hath my soul to converse with God! Company never hindereth him from hearkening to my suit: He is infinite and Omnipotent, and as sufficient for every individual soul, as if he had no other to look after in the world: when he is taken up with the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance and praises of his Heavenly Host, he is as free and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to attend and answer the groans and prayers of a contrite soul, as if he had no nobler creatures, nor no higher service to regard. I am oft unready, but God is never unready: I am unready to pray, but he is not unready to hear: I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready to come to God, to walk with him, and to solace my soul with him; but he is never unready to entertain me. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a time my conscience would have driven me away, when he hath called me to him, and rebuked my accusing fearful conscience. Many a time I have called my self a prodigal, a companion of Swine, a miserable hard-hearted sinner, unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be called his Son, when he hath called me <hi>Child,</hi> and chid me for my questioning his Love. He hath readify for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given the sins which I thought would have made my soul the fuel of Hell: He hath entertained me with joy, with musick and a feast, when I better deserved to have been among the Dogs without his doors. He hath embraced me in his sustain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing consolatory arms, when he might have spurned my guilty soul to Hell, and said, Depart from me thou worker of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, I know thee not. O little did I think that he could ever have forgotten the vanity and villany of my youth; yea so <hi>easily</hi> have forgotten my most aggravated sins. When I had sinned against light; when I had resisted conscience; when I had frequently and wilfully injured Love, I thought he would never have forgotten it: But the greatness of his Love and Mercy, and the blood and intercession of his Son, hath can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled all. O how many mercies have I tasted since I thought I had sinned away all mercies! How patiently hath he born with me, since I thought he would never have put up more?
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:59347:201"/>
And yet besides my sins and the withdrawings of my own heart, there hath been nothing to interrupt our converse. Though he be God, and I a worm, yet that would not have kept me out: Though he be in Heaven, yet he is near to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour me on Earth, in all that I call upon him for: Though he have the Praise of Angels, he disdaineth not my tears and groans: Though he have the perfect Love of perfect soul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, he knoweth the little spark in my breast, and despiseth not my weak and languid Love: Though I injure and dishonour him by Loving him no more; though I oft forget him, and have been out of the way when he he hath come or called me; though I have disobediently turned away mine ears, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindly refused the entertainments of his Love, and unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully plaid with those whose company he forbad me, he hath not divorced me, nor turned me out of doors. O wonderful! that Heaven will be familiar with Earth! and God with man! the Highest with a worm! and the most Holy with an uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant sinner! Man refuseth me, when God will entertaine me: Man, that is no wiser or better than my self. Those that I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver wronged or deserved ill of, reject me with reproach: And God whom I have unspeakably injured doth invite me, and intreat me, and condescendeth to me, as if he were beholden to me to be saved: Men that I have deserved well of, do ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre me: And God that I have deserved Hell of, doth accept me. The best of them are bryars, and as a thorny hedge, and he is Love, and Rest, and Joy: And yet I can be more wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to him, though I have offended him, than I can to them whom I have obliged: I have freer leave to cast my self into my Fathers arms, than to tumble in those bryars, or wallow in the dirt. I upbraid my self with my sins, but he doth not upbraid me with them. I condemn my self for them, but he condemns me not: He forgiveth me sooner than I can forgive my self: I have peace with him, before I can have peace of conscience.</p>
                     <p>O therefore my soul, draw near to him that is so willing of thy company! That frowneth thee not away, unless it be when thou hast fallen into the dirt, that thou mayest wash thee from thy filthiness, and be fitter for his converse. Draw near to him that will not wrong thee, by believing misreports

of enemies, or laying to thy charge the things thou knewest not: but will forgive the wrongs thou hast done to him, and justifie thee from the sins that conscience layeth to thy charge. Come to him that by his Word and Spirit, his Ministers and Mercies calleth thee to come; and hath promised that those that come to him he will in no wise shut out. O walk with him that will bear thee up, and lead thee as by the right hand (<hi>Psal.</hi> 73. 23.) and carry his Infants when they cannot go! O speak to him that teacheth thee to speak, and understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and accepts thy stammering; and helpeth thine infirmities when thou knowest not what to pray for as thou oughtest; and giveth thee <hi>groans</hi> when thou hast not <hi>words, and knoweth the meaning of his spirit in thy groans:</hi> that cannot be <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Heaven of Heavens,</hi> and yet hath respect to the <hi>contrite soul,</hi> that trembleth at his word, and feareth his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure: that pittieth the tears, and despiseth not the sigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a broken heart, nor the desires of the sorrowful. O walk with him that is never weary of the converse of an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right soul! that is never angry with thee but for flying from him, or for drawing back, or being too strange, and refusing the kindness and felicity of his presence. The day is coming when the proudest of the sons of men would be glad of a good look from him that thou hast leave to walk with: Even they that would not look on thee, and they that injured and abused thee, and they that inferiours could have no access to, O how glad would they be then of a smile, or a word of hope and mercy from thy Father! Draw near then to him, on whom the whole Creation doth depend; whose favour at last the proudest and the worst would purchase with the loudest cryes, when all their pomp and pleasure is gone, and can purchase nothing. O walk with him that is Love it self, and think <hi>him</hi> not <hi>unwilling</hi> or <hi>unlovely;</hi> and let not the deceiver by hideous misrepresentations drive thee from him: when thou hast felt a while the storms abroad, methinks thou shouldest say, How go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I will not be so uncivil as to deny those I meet a short salute, or to be friendly with my fellow-travellers: But remember O my soul, that thou dost not <hi>dwell</hi> but <hi>travel</hi> here, and that it is thy Fathers house where thou must abide for ever: yea and he is nearer thee than man (though invisible) even in thy way. O see him then that is invisible: Hearken to him when he speaketh: Obey his voice: Observe his way: Speak to him boldly, though humbly and reverently, as his child, about the great concernments of thy State: Tell him what it is that aileth thee: And seeing all thy smart is the fruit of thy own sin, confess thy folly and unkindness, crave his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness, and remember him what his Son hath suffered, and for what: Treat with him about thy future course: Desire his Grace, and give up thy self to his conduct and his cure: Weep over in his ears the history of thy misdoings and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankful course: Tell it him with penitential tears and

Speak to him especially of the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting things, and thank him for his Promises, and for thy hopes: for what thou shalt <hi>be</hi> and <hi>have</hi> and <hi>do</hi> among his <hi>Holy Ones</hi> for ever. Express thy joyes in the promise of those joyes; that thou must see his Glory, and love him and praise him better then thou canst now desire! Begin those praises, and as thou walkest with him, take pleasure in the mention of his perfections; be thankful to him and speak good of his Name: Solace thy self in remembring what a God, what a desence and portion all believers have: and in considering whither he is now conducting thee, and what he will do with thee, and what use he will make of thee for ever: Speak with Rejoycing of the glory of his works, and the righteousness of his judgements, and the holiness and evenness of his wayes: sing forth his praises with a joyful heart, and pleasant and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing voice; and frown away all slavish fears, all impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune malicious suggestions or doubts, all peevish hurtfull nip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping griefs, that would mar or interrupt the melody; and would untune or unstring a raised well composed soul.

<pb n="369" facs="tcp:59347:203"/>
that thou maist find him, and shew thee where it was that thou didst lose him, by losing thy self and turning from him I seek him and thou shalt find him: wait and he will appear in kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: For he never faileth or forsaketh those that wait up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him.</p>
                     <p>This kind of Converse, O my soul, thou hast to prosecute with thy God. Thou hast also the concernments of all <hi>his servants;</hi> his <hi>afflicted ones,</hi> his <hi>broken hearted ones,</hi> his <hi>diseased enes,</hi> his <hi>persecuted ones,</hi> to tell him of: Tell him also of the concernments of <hi>his Kingdome,</hi> the fury of his enemies, the dishonour they cast upon his Name, the matters of his Gospel, cause and interest in the world: But still let his Righteous Judgement be remembered, and all be terminated in the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious everlasting Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>Is it not much better thus to converse with him that I must be with for ever, about the place, and the company, and work, and concernments of my perpetual abode, then to be taken up with strangers in my way, and detained by their imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencies?</p>
                     <p>I have form'd my self so long in these meditations, that I will but name the rest and tell you what I had further to have treated on, and leave the enlargement to your own meditations.</p>
                     <p>8. I have no reason to be weary of converse with God, seeing <hi>it is that for which all humane converse is regardable.</hi> Converse with <hi>man</hi> is only so far desirable as it tendeth to our <hi>Converse with God:</hi> And therefore the <hi>end</hi> must be preferred before the <hi>means.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>9. It is the <hi>office of Christ,</hi> and the <hi>work of the Holy Ghost,</hi> and the <hi>use</hi> of all the <hi>means of Grace,</hi> and of <hi>all creatures, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> and <hi>afflictions,</hi> to reduce our straying souls to God, that we may converse with him and enjoy him.</p>
                     <p>10. <hi>Converse with God is most suitable to those that are so near to death;</hi> It best prepareth for it: It is likest to the work that we are next to do. We had rather when <hi>death</hi> comes, be found conversing with <hi>God</hi> then with <hi>Man:</hi> It is <hi>God</hi> that a dying man hath principally to do with: It is <hi>his judgement</hi> that he is going to; and <hi>his mercy</hi> that he hath to trust upon: And therefore it concerneth us to draw near him <hi>now,</hi> and
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:59347:204"/>
be no strangers to him, lest strangeness <hi>then</hi> should be our terrour.</p>
                     <p>11. How wonderful a condescension is it that <hi>God should be willing to converse with me!</hi> with such a worm and sinful wretch: And therefore how unexcusable is my crime, if I refuse his company, and so great a mercy!</p>
                     <p>12. Lastly, Heaven it self is but our Converse with God and his Glorified ones, (though in a more perfect manner then we can here conceive.) And therefore our holy converse with him here is the state that is likest Heaven, and that prepareth for it, and all the Heaven that is on earth.</p>

                  <div type="part">
                     <p>IT remaineth now that I briefly tell you, what you should do to attain and manage this Converse with God, in the improvement of your solitude. (For Directions in general for <hi>Walking with God,</hi> I reserve for another place.) At present let these few suffice.</p>
                     <p>Direct. 1. If you would comfortably Converse with God, <hi>make sure that you are Reconciled to him in Christ, and that he is indeed your friend and Father.</hi> Can two walk together except they be agreed? Can you take pleasure in dwelling with the consuming fire? or conversing with the most dreadful enemy? Yet this I must add, that every <hi>doubting</hi> or <hi>self-accusing soul</hi> may not find a pretence to fly from God. 1. That God ceaseth not to be a Father when ever a fearful soul is drawn to question it or deny it. 2. That in the Universal Love and Grace of God to miserable sinners, and in the universal act of conditional pardon and oblivion, and in the offers of Grace, and the readiness of God to receive the penitent, there is <hi>Glad tidings</hi> that should exceedingly rejoyce a sinner; and there is sufficient encouragement to draw the most guilty miserable sinner to seek to God, and sue for mercy. But yet the <hi>sweetest converse</hi> is for <hi>children,</hi> and for those that have <hi>some assurance</hi> that they <hi>are children.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But perhaps you will say, that <hi>this is not easily attained: How shall we know that he is our friend?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In brief, I answer, If <hi>you are unfeignedly friends to God,</hi> it is because he <hi>first loved you.</hi> Prefer him before all other
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:59347:204"/>
friends, and all the wealth and vanity of the world; Provoke him not by wilfulness or neglect: use him as your best friend, and abuse him not by disobedience or ingratitude; own him before all, at the dearest rates, whenever you are called to it: Desire his presence: Lament his absence: Love him from the bottom of your hearts: Think not hardly of him: Suspect him not: Misunderstand him not: Hearken not to his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: Receive not any false reports against him: Take him to be really Better for you than all the world: Do these, and doubt not but you are friends with God, and God with you: In a word, <hi>Be but heartily willing to be friends to God, and that God should be your chiefest friend,</hi> and you may be sure that <hi>it is so indeed,</hi> and that you <hi>are</hi> and <hi>have</hi> what you <hi>desire.</hi> And then how delightfully may you converse with God!</p>
                     <p>Direct. 2. <hi>Wholly depend on the Mediation of Christ, the great Reconciler:</hi> Without him there is no <hi>coming near to God:</hi> But in <hi>his Beloved</hi> you shall be accepted. Whatever fear of his displeasure shall surprize you, fly presently for safety unto Christ: Whatever guilt shall look you in the face, commit your self and cause to Christ, and desire him to answer for you: When the doors of mercy seem to be shut up against you, fly to him that bears the keyes, and can at any time open to you and let you in: Desire him to answer for you to God, to your consciences, and against all accusers: By him alone you may boldly and comfortably converse with God: But God will not know you out of him.</p>
                     <p>Direct. 3. <hi>Take heed of bringing particular Guilt into the presence of God, if you would have sweet communion with him:</hi> Christ himself never reconciled God to <hi>sin:</hi> And the <hi>sinner</hi> and <hi>sin</hi> are so nearly related, that for all the death of Christ, you shall <hi>feel</hi> that iniquity dwelleth not with God, but he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the works of it, and the foolish shall not stand in his sight; and that if you will presume to sin because you are his Children, <hi>be sure your fin will find you out.</hi> O what fears, what shame, what self-abhorrence and self-revenge will guilt raise in a penitent soul, when it comes into the light of the presence of the Lord! it will unavoidably abate your boldness and your comforts: When you should be sweetly delighting in his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:59347:205"/>
face, and promised Glory, you will be befooling your selves for your former sin, and ready even to tear your flesh, to think that ever you should do as you have done, and use him as you would not have used a common friend, and cast your selves upon his wrath. But an innocent soul, or pacified conscience, doth walk with God in quietness and delight, without those frowns and fears which are a taste of Hell to others.</p>
                     <p>Direct. 4. If you would comfortably converse with God, <hi>be sure that you bring not Idols in your hearts:</hi> Take heed of <hi>inordinate affection to any Creature.</hi> Let all things else be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to you, that you may have none to take up your thoughts but God. Let your <hi>Minds</hi> be further separate from them than your <hi>Bodies:</hi> Bring not into solitude or to contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a proud, or lustful, or covetous mind: It much more concerneth thee, what <hi>Heart</hi> thou bringest, that what <hi>Place</hi> thou art <hi>in,</hi> or what <hi>work</hi> thou art upon. A mind that is drowned in ambition, sensuality or passion, will scarce find God any sooner in a wilderness than in a croud (unless he be there returning from those sins to God) whereever he seeth him, God will not own and be familiar with so foul a soul. <hi>Seneca</hi> could say [<hi>Quid prodest totius regionis silentium, si af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectus fremunt?<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> What good doth the silence of all the Country do thee, if thou have the noise of raging affections within?</hi>] And <hi>Gregory</hi> saith [<hi>Qui corpore remotus vivit, &amp;c. He that in body is far enough from the tumult of humane conversation, is not in solitude, if he busie himself with earthly cogitations and desires: and he is not in the City that is not troubled with the tumult of worldly cares or fears, though he be pressed with the popular crouds.</hi>] Bring not thy house, or land, or credit, or carnal friend along with thee in thy heart, if thou desire and expect to walk in Heaven, and to converse with God.</p>
                     <p>Direct. 5. <hi>Live still by Faith: Let Faith lay Heaven and Earth as it were together:</hi> Look not at God as if he were <hi>far off:</hi> set him alwaies as before you, even as at your right hand; <hi>Psal.</hi> 16. 8. Be still with him when you awake, <hi>Psal.</hi> 1 39. 18. In the morning thank him for your rest; and deliver up your self to his conduct and service for that day. Go forth
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:59347:205"/>
as with him, and to do his work: Do every action, with the Command of God, and the Promise of Heaven before your eyes, and upon your hearts: Live as those that have incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably more to do with <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Heaven,</hi> than with all this world; That you may say with <hi>David,</hi> Psal. 37. 25, 26. (as aforecited) <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee! and there is none on Earth that I desire besides thee:</hi>] And with <hi>Paul,</hi> Phil. 1. 21. [<hi>To me to Live is Christ, and to Dye is gain</hi>] You must shut up the eye of sense (save as subordinate to Faith) and live by Faith upon a God, a Christ, and a World that is unseen, if you would know by experience what it is to be above the bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish life of sensualists, and to converse with God. O Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, if thou hadst rightly learned this blessed life, what a high and noble soul-conversation wouldst thou have! How easily wouldst thou spare, and how little wouldst thou miss the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the greatest, the presence of any worldly comfort! City or Solitude would be much alike to thee, saving that the place and state would be best to thee, where thou hast the greatest help and freedome to converse with God. Thou wouldst say of humane society as <hi>Seneca [Unus pro populo mihi est, &amp; populus pro uno: Mihi satis est unus, satis est nullus] [One is instead of all the people to me, and the people as one: One is enough for me, and none is enough.</hi>] Thus being taken up with God, thou mightest live in prison as at liberty, and in a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness as in a City, and in a place of banishment as in thy native Land: For the Earth is the Lords, and the fulness there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: and everywhere thou mayest find him, and converse with him, and lift up pure hands unto him: In every place thou art within the sight of home; and Heaven is in thine eye, and thou art conversing with that God, in whose converse the highest Angels do place their highest felicity and delight.</p>
                     <p>How little cause then have all the Churches enemies to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, that can never shut up a true believer from the presence of his God? nor banish him into such a place where he cannot have his conversation in Heaven? The stones that were cast at holy <hi>Stephen,</hi> could not hinder him from seeing the Heavens opened, and Christ sitting at the right hand of God. A <hi>Patmos</hi> allowed holy <hi>John</hi> Communion with Christ, being there in the
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:59347:206"/>
Spirit on the Lords day, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 9, 10. Christ never so spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily and comfortably owneth his servants, as when the world disowneth them, and abuseth them for his sake, and hurls them up and down as the scorn and off-scouring of all. He quickly found the blind man that he had cured, when once the Jews had cast him out, <hi>Joh.</hi> 9. 35. Persecutors do but promote the blessedness and exceeding joy of sufferers for Christ, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 11, 12.</p>
                     <p>And how little Reason then have Christians, to shun such sufferings, by unlawful means, which turn to their so great advantage? and to give so dear as the hazard of their souls by wilful sin, to escape the honour, and safety, and commodity of Martyrdome?</p>
                     <p>And indeed we judge not, we Love not, we Live not as sanctified ones must do, if we <hi>judge</hi> not that the truest Liberty, and Love it not as the Best Condition, in which we may <hi>Best</hi> converse with God. And O how much harder is it to walk with God, in a Court, in the midst of sensual delights, than in a prison or wilderness where we have none to interrupt us, and nothing else to take us up? It is our prepossessed minds, our earthly hearts, our carnal affections and concupiscence, and the pleasures of a prosperous state that are the prison and the Jaylors of our souls. Were it not for these, how <hi>free</hi> should we be, though our bodies were confined to the straightest room! He is at Liberty that can walk in Heaven, and have access to God, and make use of all the Creatures in the world, to the promoting of this his Heavenly conversation. And he is the prisoner whose soul is chained to flesh and earth, and confined to his lands and houses, and feedeth on the dust of worldly riches, or walloweth in the dung and filth of glutto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, drunkenness and lust: that are far from God, and desire not to be near him; but say to him, Depart from us, we would not have the knowledge of thy waies: that Love their prison and chains so well, that they would not be set free, but hate those with the cruellest hatred that endeavour their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance. Those are the poor prisoners of Satan, that have not liberty to believe, nor to Love God, nor converse in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, nor seriously to mind or seek the things that are high
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:59347:206"/>
and honourable: that have not liberty to meditate or pray, or seriously to speak of holy things, nor to love and converse with those that do so: that are tyed so hard to the drudgery of sin, that they have not liberty one month, or week, or day, to leave it, and walk with God so much as for a recreation! But he that liveth in the family of God, and is employed in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending him, and doth converse with Christ, and the Host of Holy ones above, in reason should not much complain of his want of friends, or company or accommodations, nor yet be too impatient of any corporal confinement.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, be sure then most narrowly to watch your hearts, that nothing have entertainment there, which is against your Liberty of converse with God. Fill not those Hearts with worldly trash, which are made and new-made to be the dwelling place of God. Desire not the company which would diminish your heavenly acquaintance and correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency. Be not unfriendly, nor conceited of a self-sufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; but yet beware lest under the honest ingenuous title of a friend, a special, faithful, prudent, faithful friend, you should entertain an Idol, or an enemy to your Love of God, or a corrival and competitor with your highest friend: For if you do, it is not the specious title of a friend that will save you from the thorns and bryars of disquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and from greater troubles than ever you found from open enemies.</p>
                     <p>O blessed be that High and everlasting friend, who is every way suited to the upright souls! To their Minds, their Memories, their Delight, their Love, &amp;c. by surest Truth, by fullest Goodness, by clearest Light, by dearest Love, by firmest Constancy, &amp;c.—O why hath my drowsie and dark-sighted soul been so seldome with him! why hath it so often, so strangely, and so unthankfully pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by, and not observed him, nor hearkened to his kindest calls! O what is all this trash and trouble<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that hath filled my memory, and employed my mind, and cheated and corrupted my affections, while my dearest Lord hath been daies and nights so unworthily forgotten, so contemptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously neglected and disregarded, and loved as if I loved him
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:59347:207"/>
not! O that these <hi>drowsie</hi> and those <hi>waking</hi> nights, those loitered, lost, and empty hours had been spent in the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest converse with him, which have been dreamed and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted away upon—now I know not what! O my God, how much wiser and happier had I been, had I rather chosen to mourn with thee, than to rejoyce and sport with any other! O that I had rather wept with thee, than laughed with the creature! For the time to come let that be my friend, that most befriendeth my dark, and dull, and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward soul, in its undertaken progress, and heavenly conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation! Or if there be none such upon earth, let me here take no one for my friend! O blot out every Name from my corrupted heart, which hindereth the deeper engraving of thy Name! Ah Lord, what a stone, what a blind un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful thing, is a Heart not touched with celestial Love! yet shall I not run to thee, when I have none else that will know me! shall I not draw near thee, when all fly from me! When daily experience cryeth out so loud [NONE BUT CHRIST: GOD OR NOTHING.] Ah foolish Heart, that hast thought of it [Where is that place, that Cave or Desert, where I might soonest find thee, and fullest enjoy thee? is it in the wilderness that thou walkest, or in the croud: in the Closet, or in the Church? where is it that I might soonest meet with God?] But alas, I now perceive, that I have a <hi>Heart</hi> to find, before I am like to find my <hi>Lord!</hi> O Loveless, Lifeless, stony heart! that's dead to him that gave it Life! and to none but him! Could I not <hi>Love,</hi> or <hi>Think,</hi> or <hi>Feel</hi> at all, methinks I were less dead than now? Less dead, if dead, than now I am alive? I had almost said [Lord, let me never Love more till I can Love thee? Nor think more on any thing till I can more willingly think of thee?] But I must suppress that wish; for <hi>Life</hi> will <hi>act:</hi> And the mercies and motions of <hi>Nature</hi> are <hi>necessary</hi> to those of Grace. And therefore in the life of Nature, and in the glim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merings of thy Light, I will wait for more of the Celestial life! My God, thou hast my consent! It is here attested under my hand: <hi>Separate me from what and whom thou wilt so I may but be nearer thee!</hi> Let me Love thee more, and feel more of
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:59347:207"/>
thy Love, and then let me Love or be beloved of the world, as little as thou wilt.</p>
                     <p>I thought <hi>self-love</hi> had been a more predominant thing: But now I find that Repentance hath its Anger, its Hatred and its Revenge! I am truly Angry with that Heart that hath so oft and foolishly offended thee! Methinks I <hi>hate</hi> that Heart that is so cold and backward in thy love, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most grudge it a dwelling in my breast! Alas when Love should be the life of Prayer, the life of holy meditation, the life of Sermons and of holy conference, and my soul in these should long to meet thee, and delight to mention thee, I straggle Lord, I know not whither! or I sit still and wish, but do not rise and run and follow thee, yea I do not what I seem to do. All's dead, all's dead, for want of Love! I often cry, O where is that place, where the quickening beams of Heaven are warmest, that my frozen soul might seek it out! But whither ever I go, to City or to Solitude, alas, I find it is not <hi>Place</hi> that makes the difference. I know that Christ is perfectly replenished with Life and Light and Love Divine: And I hear him as our Head and Treasure pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed and offered to us in the Gospel! This is thy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, that he that hath the Son hath Life! O why then is my barren soul so empty! I thought I had long ago con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to thy offer; and then according to thy Covenant, both He and Life in him are mine! And yet must I still be dark and dead!</p>
                     <p>Ah dearest Lord, I say not that I have too long waited! but if I <hi>continue thus</hi> to wait, wilt thou never find the time of Love? and come and own thy gasping worm? wilt thou ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver dissipate these clouds, and shine upon this dead and darkened soul? Hath my Night no Day? Thrust me not from thee O my God! For that's a Hell, to be thrust from God. But sure the cause is all at home, could I find it out, or rather could I cure it! It is sure <hi>my</hi> face that's turned from God, when I say, His face is turned from me. But if my Life must here be out of sight, and hidden in the Root (with Christ in God,) and if all the rest be reserved for that better world, and I must here have but these small beginnings, O make me
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:59347:208"/>
more to Love and long for the blessed day of thine appearing, and not to fear the time of my deliverance, nor unbelievingly to linger in this <hi>Sodom,</hi> as one that had rather stay with sin, then come to thee! Though sin hath made me backward to the <hi>fight,</hi> let it not make me backward to receive the Crown; Though it hath made me a loiterer in thy work, let it not make me backward to receive that wages, which thy Love will give to our pardoned, poor, accepted services. Though I have too oft drawn back, when I should have come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, and walked with thee in thy waies of Grace, yet heal that unbelief, and disaffection, which would make me to draw back, when thou callest me to possess thy Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? Though the sickness and lameness of my soul have hindered me in my journey, yet let their painfulness help me to desire to be delivered from them and to be at home, where (without the interposing nights of thy dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure) I shall fully feel thy fullest Love, and walk with thy Glorified ones in the Light of thy Glory, triumphing in thy Praise for evermore,</p>
                     <closer>Amen.</closer>

                     <p>BUT now I have given you these few Directions for the <hi>improvement of your solitude for converse with God,</hi> lest I should occasion the hurt of those that are unfit for the Lesson I have given, I must conclude with this Caution (which I have formerly also published,) That it is not me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly or weak-headed persons, who are not able to bear such exercises, for whom I have written these Directions. Those that are not able to be much in serious solitary thoughtfulness, without confusions and distracting suggesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and hurrying vexatious thoughts, must set themselves for the most part to those duties which are to be done in company by the help of others; and must be very little in solitary duties: For to them whose natural faculties are so diseased or weak, it is <hi>no duty,</hi> as being <hi>no means</hi> to do them the desired good; but while they strive to do that which
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:59347:208"/>
they are naturally unable to endure, they will but confound and distract themselves, and make themselves unable for those other duties which yet they are not utterly unfit for. To such persons therefore instead of ordered, well-digested Meditations, and much time spent in secret thoughtfulness, it must suffice that they be brief in secret Prayer, and take up with such occasional abrupter Meditations as they are capable of, and that they be the more in reading, hearing, conference, and praying and praising God with others: untill their melancholly distempers are so far overcome, as that (by the direction of their Spiritual Guides) they may judge themselves fit for this improvement of their Solitude.</p>
