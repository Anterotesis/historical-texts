         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head type="sub">The Power and Excellencie of this COVENANT.</head>
            <p>A Covenat is the laſt reſort of the godly and wiſe Chriſtian; and with this,
he draws himſelf neerer Heaven, and cloſer to that glorious Eſſence, and
the immediate flowings and emanation of an Almighty power: A Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
is ſuch an Obligation, as ſayes an ingagement upon the ſoule; and as in toſſings
and ſtorms at Sea, the Marriners find out no ſafer courſe then by caſting out Cords
and Anchors, to hold them at ſome Period; ſo in civill waves and ſpirituall fluctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
there cannot be a more ſecure experiment, then this of Covenanting, which
is like the caſting out our Coards and Anchors, as they did in St. <hi>Pauls</hi> ſtorm,
<hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndergirding the ſhip and caſting out four Anchors. Covenants,</hi> they are Divine En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines,
which the godly have found out to winde up their ſoules from irregular wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drings
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:159150:2"/>
and ſtrayings, into heavenly heights and ſtations, the only remedy, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventive
againſt relapſes &amp; Apoſtaſies; and thoſe vertues and operations the Saints
have ever found in Covenants: for ſuch reſolutions of ſoul, are but the finer cordage,
which the Spirit ſpins out, and twiſts from the ſubſtance of its own eſſence; and
now God and his Angels have ſomething to hold our ſouls by, even the operations
and effluxes of our own ſpirits: and though God need none of thoſe, but is able to
keep us up by the immediate and indiſtant workings of his holy Spirit, yet he is a
God that is pleaſed to take us at our own rebound, and to admit us into that holy
conſociation, <hi>Wee as workers together with him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He that covenants with God, by that very act doth carry up himſelf unto Gods
Throne, and cites his ſoul to his Tribunall, and then the Majeſty of God looks on
him with a fuller gleam; and ſo long as that glorious interview continues, or any
ſparkling or raying of it, man is awed from ſinning, and ſtands trembling like the
people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> while God appear'd upon the <hi>Mount.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus Divine Covenants, as they exalt and ſituate a ſoul in more glory then
before, even in the glorious face of God, ſo they are the ſpirituall ſtayes and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
and ſtrengthnings of a ſoule.</p>
            <p>God himſelf firſt drew forth his own eſſence into this courſe of Covenants to
<hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Joſhua,</hi> and his people; and from that Covenant he went
higher, to one of grace, beſides the particular obligations of his, to <hi>Noah</hi> and other
Saints, not as if he received any conſolidation or conformation by it, or any ſuch
act of covenanting that he had not before; not as if he begun to react upon himſelf
in any new operation (far be it from his immutable eſſence) he was as firm and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable
in the eternall immanencie of his own before ever hee paſſed himſelf
abroad into any ſuch act of paction: and therefore he could not ſhew himſelf to
man in the likeneſſe of any other notion, than, <hi>I am.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Only hee was pleaſed to light us by a beam of his own nature, into this duty of
holy confederation, and to ſhew us a new way of ſpirituall advancement and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment:
How ſacred then? and how inviolable ought theſe to be? which are
made with a moſt high <hi>God;</hi> when even pactions and promiſes, and Covenants in
friendſhips and lower confederations, are reputed holy.</p>
            <p>Thus far of the power of the Covenant upon the ſoul in that grand and heavenly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement;
now there is a power reflexive, and that is a return it makes from Heaven,
and in that return it brings with it ſomething of God; for the ſoul going up thither by a
ſpirituall might and holy violence, brings away from thence graces and bleſſings, and the
reſort of many temporall mercies, as when <hi>Moſes</hi> had been looking God in the face, he
brought a divine luſtre upon his own, home with him.</p>
            <p>We ſee <hi>Nehemiah's</hi> Covenant had excellent concomitances, the dedication was kept
with gladneſſe, and ſinging and Pſalteries, and the people offered themſelves willingly,
and the buſineſſe at Jeruſalem, and all the affairs of Gods Houſe went better on in all
the particulars, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 11. 3. 12. 27.</p>
            <p>The Covenant of <hi>Judah</hi> drew along with it the like bleſſings; the Lord was found of
them and gave them reſt; and one more ſuperlative bleſſing, not inconſiſtent with our
calamity, <hi>Maachah</hi> was removed from being Queen, becauſe ſhe had made an Idoll in
a Grove, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 5. 25, 26.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:159150:2"/>
And for this Covenant of ours I am bold to ſay, it hath been in heaven already; it
came not only from thence in its firſt inſpiration, but it hath had a return back, and by
the power of that reflexive act, it hath brought down with it cheerfull concurrences and
contributions in both Kingdoms, and there are divine ſtirrings, and movings, and aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
in the people of late: and as in the Pool of <hi>Betheſda</hi> the ſtirrings and troubles in
the waters were the only ſigne of the Angels coming down: So theſe <hi>waters</hi> in both
Kingdoms, which in the holy Spirits language are <hi>people,</hi> do ſtir and move more of
late, not only in their higheſt and ſupreme repreſentative, but in their own places, which
is an indication of ſome divine vertue, deſcended and co-operating.</p>

for ſins, are ſuch as will bring <hi>God</hi> into this Kingdom, and ſeat him, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
his preſence, as the Tabernacle, and Ark, and Temple, were the ingagements
and inthronizations of, and myſterious fixations of Gods Divinity.</p>
            <p>They are likewiſe an advancement of the Nation too, ſetting it higher then other
Nations, that was the preferment of the Jewes <hi>That to them the Oracles of God were
committed.</hi> Therefore they were ſaid to dwell in the light, when other Nations <hi>ſate
in the Region and ſhadow of death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that Principle of Reformation according to the Word of God, and the beſt
Reformed Churches, brings us cloſer to God, and conſociates us with heaven, aud
makes us arrive at the higheſt myſterie, even the <hi>deniall of our ſelves,</hi> our own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions,
wil-worſhip, and ſuperſtitions; pulling down at once all our relations to
<hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Popery,</hi> and working to he pattern; ſo, <hi>That things which ſhall be ſeen,
ſhall not be made of things which do appear:</hi> wee ſhall likewiſe be aſſociated to the
Church of Chriſt, and ſo incorporated more clearly and purely, and myſtically, into
the body of Chriſt, we ſhall be now in a capacity with them, to partake equally of
graces and priviledges: and thus the Kingdome of Chriſt gathers power and lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
and ſtretches to the bredth of that Prophecie, <hi>Of the fulneſs of the Gentiles,</hi> and
gathers ſtrength too againſt the preſent Antichriſtian Monarchie; and by that other
Principle of humiliation, we obtain the qualification and condition for mercie and
peace, we approach into terms of reconciliation with God; if the <hi>wicked forſake his
way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, God will forgive, and abundantly pardon.</hi>

What is it that thickens the cloud over us, but the evaporation &amp; exhalation of our
ſins and iniquities, <hi>For our iniquities have turned away theſe things, and your ſins
have with-held good things from you.</hi>

            <p>HEre lies the Propheticall power of it againſt the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian
Monarchy, and the bloody plots and conſpiracies are ſuch freſh
remembrances, as ſeal us to ſtrong and perpetuall endeavours, we can read in the
leaves of our former Ages, their conſpiracies ſtill in red Letters, and at this day we
have a ſucceſſion of their bloody Deſignes, and I conceive the riſe we take from
their own foundations in blood, is but in holy paralell to him, <hi>into whoſe remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
great Babylon came to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceneſſe of
wrath;</hi> and to his own peoples reſolution, <hi>Happy ſhall he be that rewardeth thee
as thou haſt ſerved us;</hi> and the treacheries and tyrannies of Gods enemies have
ever drawn along with them this reſolution in Gods people; <hi>Amaleck</hi> and <hi>Aſbur,</hi>
and <hi>Egypt,</hi> are ſtanding examples of Divine revenge.</p>
            <p>And for Extirpation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is but a retaliation to their own juſt cruelty, who would
raze out the name of <hi>Iſrael, that it ſhould be no more in remembrance.</hi> And what
hath their endeavour in our Kingdome of <hi>Ireland</hi> been, but an eradication of our
memories.</p>
            <p>And our confederations now, cannot but be powerful in the very notion; Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Leagues have brought forth great effects in Stats &amp; kingdoms, in the mutual ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
&amp; aſſiſtings; and therfore <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſent to <hi>Syria,</hi> &amp; <hi>Judah</hi> to <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> and <hi>Iudah</hi>
to <hi>Iſrael</hi> and other Kingdoms have ſought to one another for ſuch combinations, in
any grand Enterpriſe; That famous Deſign of Chriſtendome, which was ſuch a uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall
confederation againſt the Turk, onely it was a Deſigne in a wrong chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell;
Therefore the more ſpirituall that Leagues are, the more powerfull; that
which made <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſo famous in their conqueſts to <hi>Canaan,</hi> was the Aſſociation of
the Tribes, and the <hi>Arke of God amongſt them,</hi> therefore the Philiſtims cryed out,
<hi>Woe unto us, the Arke of God is in the Campe of the Hebrewes;</hi> and when they
marched with the Arke amongſt them, <hi>Iordan</hi> was driven back, and the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
and little hills were removed, the walls of <hi>Iericho</hi> fell; And certainely this
grand and bleſſed Aſſociation of the three Kingdoms, is a glorious portent to the
deſtruction of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelfe, carrying amongſt them ſuch an Arke and Goſpel;
this is the firſt time that ever the Sun ſaw ſuch a <hi>Triple Confederation</hi> againſt the
<hi>Triple Crown,</hi> ſo many States, ſo ſolemnly combined againſt the Popiſh Hierarchy;
this is the time the Spirit of God hath ſet up a <hi>Standard;</hi> this is a faire riſe, and
improvement to the Prophecie, <hi>When the Princes of the earth ſhall gather themſelvs
together, and ſhall agree to make her deſolate.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:159150:4"/>
I know there hath beene many confederations, but they were narrower than
this, and ſo, oppoſings, and ſtrong ones too, and by confederacies too; yet thoſe
were but ſingle to this, when our Princes in their eyes appeared in their graduall
Extirpations, our <hi>Henry,</hi> and <hi>Edward,</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> when in <hi>Scotland,</hi> they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the French power and Idolatry, ayded by a power from this Kingdom: yet
theſe were not from ſuch ſtrong reſolutions, ſuch able Principles, ſuch a Sacred
Covenant; they were but ordinary and civill contributions, and weak ſtrivings,
and ſo had ſhorter extirpations, and relapſes, and had little more of Religion,
then brought them into the fields, and enabled them to break down Images: The
Confederations and Covenants in <hi>Germany,</hi> ſo many Princes and States entring
into a ſolemn Proteſtation upon <hi>Luthers</hi> diſcoveries; The Confederations of thoſe
in <hi>Holland,</hi> and thoſe States in the <hi>Netherlands;</hi> The Confederation of thoſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in <hi>France;</hi> But theſe had their ebbings and flowings. But now, as if this were
the Antichriſtian <hi>criſis,</hi> and as if the Reformation had recovered the Period of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination,
three kingdoms ſtrike into a Sacred League; And now me thinks I hear
the Angell ſaying to us, <hi>The Prince of the Kingdom of Perſia withſtood me one and
twenty dayes, but loe, Michael one of your chiefe Princes came in to help me, and now
I am come to make you underſtand what ſhall befall in the latter daies; now me thinks
the ſet time to favour Sion is come, her ſervants take pleaſure in her ſtones.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for the Extirpation of Prelacie, though it be a government rivetted into
our Laws and uſages; and into the judgements, and Conſciences of ſome, through a
miſtaken and colluding Divinity, yet let us not like the Jewes, loſe our Goſpell,
with holding our Laws too faſt; I know this Kingdom hath ever been a retentive
nation of Cuſtomes, and old Conſtitutions, and it parted but ſadly with its old
<hi>Paganiſme,</hi> and with its latter <hi>Antichriſtianiſme,</hi> in the deſolation of Abbies and
Priories; And hence it is that Reformations in this Nation, hath been with ſuch lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
power and duration, for we have ever eaſily gone back with a new ſucceſſour,
never taking in ſo much of the power of godlineſſe, as ſhould be able to make us
live Proteſtants to another ſucceſſion; and eſpecially the ſuperſtitions and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
of late, were woven with ſuch ſtrange and plauſible inſinuations; Epiſcopacie
was got upon the bottome of miſ-interpreted Scriptures; and the whole Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon a pretended Antiquity; and the Innovations upon a ſpirituall Decencie
and Order; upon an Eccleſiaſticall Magiſtrality, &amp; Reverend Infallibility, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digeous
Policy; as if there were no way to bring a Papiſt to Church, but by going
with him to <hi>Rome</hi> firſt; if we conſider well we ſhall finde cauſe enough to remove
theſe as not conſiſtent with the holy ſimplicity of the Goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt; nor
the ſpirituall purity; we were then trading with Popery, when we ignorantly
thought, we had not enough to ſerve us from the Scriptures of God, now we ſee
they are perfect and compleat in Ieſus Chriſt; let us caſt away thoſe weak and
beggarly rudiment<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, of the which <hi>we are now aſhamed;</hi> and they do not ſavour the
things of God, who would now (like <hi>Saul</hi> at <hi>Endor</hi>) raiſe up <hi>Aaron,</hi> and the whole
Hierarchy, and bring us back againe to the Law, forcing us under that coole ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
of <hi>Types</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> drawing the curtains of the Law before the light
of the Goſpel; we ſerve now in the newneſſe of the ſpirit, not in the deadneſſe of
the letter.</p>

The next thing I obſerve, is the Politicall excellency, thoſe ſound maximes for
the Kingdomes duration, as the preſervation of Parliamentary rights, and Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
rights, and Royall rights, that they exceed not, nor exorbitate, and this is no
more then to reduce the Kingdome into its primitive contemperation, and to keep
the mixture even: for we ſee that whileſt the power of Monarchy would needs
take in ſuch poyſoned principles, as the Divines and Privadoes did inſtill, carrying
up the notion of a King into an higher firmament then its owne, the whole State
was in a poſture of ruine: for nothing hath more betrayed Kingdomes into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive
alterations then exorbitancie of government, and States muſt reſpect
their fundamentals and originals in their preſent conſtitution, for thoſe in<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
diſpoſitions into all the Orders and ſubordinations, and that ingagement ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
to incline to their own intereſts, and then in their inclinations and purſuite
thither, tumults and ſtirs are wakened, and there is a noiſe of ſome new and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
indeavour, when it is but the naturall workings of each degree for its
owne preſervation, and hence have theſe late aſperſions been born and received,
the Princes and people being carried on by the ſtrength and violence of a late
predominancie, almoſt out of ſight of their true fundamentalls, till they have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
their intereſts, and maligne thoſe that would bring them back: and for the
temper of our Engliſh Monarchy, I will not ſay more to the praiſe of the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
(ſo many having ſpoken before me) than its own duration, breathing to
this day, under the ſucceſſion of ſo many ages, and never diſtemper'd, but when
the <hi>fiduciary</hi> power would needs be ſeverer and taller then the reſt, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
deſignes of trying ſtrengths and intereſts, to ſee, <hi>If the fire out of the bramble
would at length come forth, and conſume the trees of the Forreſt.</hi> And whereas there
are ſome other ſubordinate principles in order to theſe, as the diſcovery of Incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diaries
and Malignants: certainely they that ſhall ſuffer any relations to corrupt
them to ſecrecie, are men of too narrow affections for the latitude of a kingdom,
they are only in the reputation of Patriots and Fidelio's to their country, who
have ſuch a command of ſpirit, as they can open and cloſe as the occaſion of the
State requires.</p>
            <p>And I do further obſerve, that we are obliged to a mutuall preſervation of the
peace of the Kingdomes, and in ſpeciall of the Reformation of the Church in
<hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the firſt, it is bottom'd upon the foundation of our government, which is a
concentration of the three eſtates in one, and there is ſuch a ſameneſſe almoſt in
the fundamentalls of the three, and there is ſuch a Monarchicall oneneſſe which
influences into all, that if any alteration begin in any one of them, it will ſoone,
like an infection (where there is conſanguinity of nature) ſpread and make over
to the reſt, ſo that there is as much policie in ſuffering our care and faithfulneſſe
to enlarge and acquaint it ſelf with the intereſt of the other Eſtates, which are in
no other ſenſe forraine, than onely in the diſtance of place.</p>
            <p>And for the particular preſervation of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> it is as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
an intereſt as any of the reſt, what godly ſoule will repine to take up the
care of another Church, he was (we know) a ſanguinary man that replyed, <hi>Am I
<pb facs="tcp:159150:5"/>
my brothers keeper?</hi> And we may take notice there how God calls for an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of every relation at our hands. It was an holy principle that perſwaded
the Apoſtle <hi>To take care of all the Churches:</hi> and the more neare we approach
to ſuch endeavours, the more neer we are to the deſignes and activity of God
and Angels, whoſe buſineſſe and adminiſtration is univerſall; and eſpecially ſhould
our care be for that Church and State, which hath been the conſervatory of the
Goſpell, and kept alive that holy ſpark, which we in this kingdom do warm our
ſouls by at this day; ſhe was that <hi>Philadelphia who kept the Word of his patience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor let any complain of reſtraints in this our Covenant, as if we multiplyed
unneceſſary oaths, as if like <hi>Sauls</hi> oath it had <hi>troubled the land,</hi> there is no ſuch
true Liberty, as in theſe <hi>holy restraints;</hi> nor is it any diminution to our Chriſtian
Latitude, that we cannot tranſgreſſe nor exceede in this or that; it is rather the
ſublimation of our Liberty, and a deliverance into the <hi>glorious liberty of the Sons of
God;</hi> and as it is the higheſt perfection, <hi>non poſſe peccare,</hi> not to be able to tranſgreſſe;
ſo our eſtate and condition in this our Covenant, is a degree to that, for <hi>God, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi>
and <hi>Siants,</hi> are not leſſe perfect, nor leſſe free, becauſe they cannot ſin, but is
a firmation of ſoul in the height of holineſſe, for as it is the higheſt aggravation of
ſinne, not to be able to do good, ſo it is the higheſt perfection of goodneſſe, not to be able to do
ill; ſo that I know none that hath a ſpirituall and diſcerning ſoul, that will complain for want of
liberty to tranſgreſſe; or that he is in heaven before his time: ſuch chaines are but <hi>chaines of gold,</hi>
nay, but the <hi>bracclets of the Spouſe,</hi> and as it is the devils and reprobates torment and miſery to be
held in <hi>chaines of darkneſſe,</hi> ſo it is the glory of the bleſſed Saints and Angels to be held in ſuch
chaines of light and holineſſe; and none but Libertines will complaine, that they are walled in,
and that their luſts have nor liberty to anger God, and undo their Country.</p>
            <p>I obſerve another tranſcendency in it, there have bin many Covenants taken by the people of God
<hi>Ioſiahs, Iehoſhaphats,</hi> &amp; <hi>Nehemiahs,</hi> the <hi>Forraign Proteſtations</hi> &amp; thoſe of our own, yet none that hath
ſuch a <hi>Spirituall</hi> and <hi>Politicall breadth</hi> in it, reaching not onely to Nationals, but al particulars;
and taking in the furtheſt, and moſt forraign neceſſary, and circumſtance either in <hi>ſtate,</hi> or <hi>Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I might take in other particulars, but they are ſuch as cleer up to your firſt diſcovery, onely my
thoughts have rouled up themſelves into this concluſion.</p>
            <p>Since the <hi>Covenant</hi> is of this tranſcendency and excellency, ſo ſolemn and ſacred, it were fit
there were ſome holy deſigne, to work it more cloſe to the ſoules of thoſe that take it, all our <hi>hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe,
ſpirituall</hi> and <hi>civill,</hi> is now in the ſucceſſe of our confederation with our God, and therefore
there would be as much holy art uſed in preſerving the ſpirits of people in that height of <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting,</hi>
as there was uſed in the rayſing them up; God himſelf makes <hi>conſervation</hi> as much his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe
as the <hi>creation</hi> of the world, and therefore ſome make it the ſame act repeated againe.</p>
            <p>I ſhould think it not unneceſſary, that thoſe parts in it which have moſt of the <hi>atteſtations</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation,</hi>
and <hi>imprecation,</hi> and moſt of the <hi>Politicall</hi> and civill advantages, be ſet on by the miniſtery
in frequent inculcations, even to a <hi>Catechiſing,</hi> and by a civil ordinance, or law to that purpoſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minde
