            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

CHARLES Earl of SHREWSBURY.</head>
            <p>THis following Case being drawn up, and Printed by some of the Agents and Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citors
of the Creditors of <hi>Sir William Courten</hi> and <hi>Sir Paul Pyndar,</hi> for satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of several Persons that were earnest to have it Published; and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
to all the late Members of both Houses of <hi>Parliament;</hi> I obstructed the
progress thereof, being resolved that it should not go so nakedly into the world without any
<hi>Title</hi> or <hi>Dedication,</hi> and then only to the view of such Persons as are principally Interessed
and Concerned therein; I am obliged to let Your <hi>Lordship</hi> and the rest of the Creditors know,
that I have been in my Quality, as <hi>Administrator</hi> and <hi>Assignee,</hi> both Active and Passive, at
home and abroad, ever since his Majesties Restauration, in the pursuit of such our Rights
and Properties, that cannot be Mortified or Extinguished, except Mankind be Exterminated.</p>
            <p>There are Volumes of Examinations and Depositions by me, taken from the Servants, Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers,
Factors and Sea-men, imployed by <hi>Sir William Courten,</hi> in Discovering, Planting,
and Fortifying the <hi>Island</hi> of <hi>Barbadoes;</hi> manifesting to all the World, that he was the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Proprietor of that <hi>Island,</hi> and so Confirmed to him and his Heirs, by <hi>Letters Patents,</hi>
under the great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> in the third year of <hi>King Charles</hi> the first: Yet no Restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or Reparation could be obtained to this day, for the forceable Entries and Intrusions
made by <hi>James</hi> late Earl of <hi>Carlisle,</hi> and his Complices upon <hi>Sir William Courten</hi> in the
said <hi>Island.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are as many more Volumes of Examinations, Depositions, Memorials, Answers,
Replications, Rejoynders, and other proceedings in several Languages by me, in the case of
the <hi>East-India</hi> Spoyls and Depredations upon <hi>Courten</hi> and <hi>Pyndar,</hi> before the values of the
Loss and Damages were reduced to a certainty, by <hi>Letters Patents</hi> under the great Seal of
<hi>England;</hi> which vested the Interest with an Authority irrevokable in the Grantees for reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
thereof, according to the Rules of Law and Common Right; Yet no Restitution or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation
can be obtained for the same.</p>
            <p>There are little less Volumes of Proceedings upon the Civil Actions, depending in <hi>Holland</hi>
and <hi>Zealand,</hi> against the Heirs and Executors of <hi>Sir James Cats, Jacob Pergens,</hi> and
<hi>Peter Boudaen,</hi> for Monies lent upon Bonds, and Accompts standing out in Trade. Yet all

and forgetfulness.</p>
            <p>Your <hi>Grandfather, John</hi> Earl of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> having lent the Sum of five and twenty
hundred pounds to <hi>Sir William Courten,</hi> towards his first Expedition into the <hi>East-Indies,
China,</hi> and <hi>Japan,</hi> upon whose foundation the present great <hi>East-India</hi> Trade is erected. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Death of <hi>Sir William; William Courten</hi> his Son and Heir, together with <hi>Sir Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

<pb facs="tcp:98727:3"/>
all the ready Money then in your Family.) Whereupon <hi>Francis</hi> Earl of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> your
<hi>Father,</hi> with divers other great Sufferers (Creditors of <hi>Sir William Courten,</hi> and his Son,
as also of <hi>Sir Paul Pyndar)</hi> applied themselves in company with me upon the Kings most
happy Restauration, for some seasonable relief against the <hi>Hollanders</hi> and <hi>Zealanders,</hi> that
had lived upon the spoyls of all Nations.</p>
            <p>His Majesty being then upon a Treaty of <hi>Common Alliance</hi> with the <hi>States General:</hi>
After eight months debate in <hi>Courtens</hi> affair, came to this Stipulation in the year 1662.
That upon restitution of the <hi>Island</hi> of <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

Depredations concerning the two Ships named the <hi>Bona Esperanza</hi> and <hi>Henry Bona Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura;</hi>
All other Losses and Damages of his Subjects; and even that of <hi>Amboyna,</hi> should be
Mortified and Obliterated, that is to say, <hi>No Soveraign remedy should be given to any
of them by his Majesty, for the said Damages by Reprizalls;</hi> which was Mutually
Signed, and Solemnly Ratified accordingly.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Stipulation</hi> was pursued by several Memorialls to the <hi>States General,</hi> for the space
of two years, at the <hi>Hague,</hi> and seconded by divers Orders from the <hi>Council Board,</hi> and
several <hi>Letters</hi> of Recomendation from his <hi>Maiesty,</hi> to the said <hi>States,</hi> under his <hi>Sign Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual,</hi>
which proving all innefectual. A Complaint thereof being brought before the <hi>House
of Commons,</hi> in the year 1664. was there Espoused with vast <hi>Royal Aides,</hi> towards the
Protection and Relief of the Complaynants: Therefore they are under great mistakes, both
in matters of Fact and Iudgment of Law, that Report the King was either Surprized or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in his Grant, or that the <hi>States General</hi> had not due Notice of Passing the <hi>Letters
Patents,</hi> for Restitution to be made to the said <hi>Francis</hi> Earl of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> and others
in the said Patent Mentioned and Expressed; being grounded upon several Acts of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
and the Ancient Law of <hi>Marque,</hi> and <hi>Reprizals:</hi> The Instances whereof, once
brought home to a <hi>Fiat</hi> under the great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> becomes a Decree unalterable, like
the Laws of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I beg Your Lordships Pardon and Patience, in craving Your Honours Serious Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
upon the said Case; and the Creditors Proposals to his Majesty; with the Postscript after
them, in answer to the Lord <hi>Chancellors</hi> Arguments, on <hi>Friday</hi> the 26<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>May</hi> last,
when his Lordship gave Iudgment for the King, upon the <hi>Scire-Facias,</hi> concerning the said
<hi>Letters Patents,</hi> wherein Your Grandfathers Debt is included; yet further secured by
Collateral Covenants from my self, respectively to Your Honour and Sir <hi>Thomas Meres</hi>

            <head>The Case between the King and Carew, concerning the
Letters Patents for Reprisals (hereunto annexted)
against the Hollanders; Briefly and faithfully stated,
for satisfaction of all persons concerned.</head>

               <hi>GEorge Carew</hi> of <hi>Richmond,</hi> in the County of <hi>Surrey</hi> 
               <abbr>Esq</abbr>; Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strator
of the Goods and Chattels of Sir <hi>William Courten</hi> Knight
deceased, with his Will annexed; having contested at the <hi>Hague</hi>
and <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> after the Kings Restoration, for the space of
fifteen Months, concerning the Spoils and Depredations,
upon Sir <hi>William Courten's</hi> Ships and Factories: A <hi>Provisoe</hi> was made in
the fifteenth Article of the Treaty concluded at LONDON, between the
King and the <hi>States General,</hi> the 4th. of <hi>September</hi> 1662. that satisfaction and
reparation should be made by the <hi>East-India</hi> Company of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi>
for the two Ships named the <hi>Bona Esperanza</hi> and <hi>Henry Bona Adventura,</hi> with
their Freights and Lading.</p>
            <p>In pursuance of the said Treaty, <hi>Carew</hi> having Expended and Disbursed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
great Sums of Money, both in <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>England</hi> without effect, he was
prompted by several Ministers of State at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> to Address himself by
Petition to the Commons in Parliament, in the year 1664. for Relief, who
referred the same to the Committee of Grievances accordingly.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Tho. Clifford,</hi> then Chairman of the said Committee, after Examination
of all the Papers and Depositions concerning this Case, brought in by Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
Littleton,</hi> Reported that the Loss and Damages amounted to the Sum of
One Hundred and Fifty Thousand pounds Sterling and upwards, hinting at
the evil consequences thereof, to the Honour and Interest of the Nation, if
those Damages were not satisfied and repaired unto the Families of Sir
<hi>William Courten</hi> and Sir <hi>Paul Pindar,</hi> who had merited so much from the
Crown and Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Soon after a War insued, whereupon the Commons Voted to assist the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98727:4"/>
King with their Lives and Fortunes, unto whom they granted several Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions
of Money for the Prosecution thereof.</p>
            <p>In the Month of <hi>May</hi> 1665. the Cause concerning the said Spoils and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>predations
which had been debated in the Admiralty, in Council, and in
Parliament, was reduced to a certainty, for satisfaction by Letters Patents
for Reprisals under the Great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> wherein Sir <hi>Edmund Turnors</hi>
Name is used in Trust, <hi>Carew</hi> having the Interest in Law on the behalf of
himself and others, the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ambassador then Resident in <hi>England</hi> had
notice of all the proceedings, as it is recited in the body of the said Patent,
which passed through the greatest Offices of Trust in the Kingdom, upon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Consideration.</p>
            <p>The Warrant for passing the said Patent, issued out of the Lord <hi>Arlingtons</hi>
Office, then Principal Secretary of State, containing two clauses for conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
of the Grant, until the Debt of 151612l. with Damages should be
recovered, which was debated three Months, by the Lord Chancellor <hi>Hyde,</hi>
before it passed the Great Seal, Sir <hi>William Turnor</hi> and Sir <hi>Robert Wiseman</hi>
the Kings and Dukes Advocates general, being often consulted therein, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed,
That it was consonant to the Laws of Nature and Nations, that the
said Debt and Damages should be satisfied and repaired. A President there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

be Reprised, who upon a Peace made with <hi>Spain,</hi> had the remainder of his
Debt unsatisfied.</p>
            <p>In the year 1666. <hi>Carew</hi> and the Creditors claiming under him, procured
several Duplicates and Exemplifications of the said Letters Patents, and put
the same in execution, by deputations against the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> who Trading in
divers Bottoms, under the colours of <hi>Sweeds, Hamburgers</hi> and other Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boring

Court appears.</p>
            <p>However Sir <hi>William Coventry</hi> then Secretary to his Royal Highness com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining,
That those special Letters of Reprisal, obstructed the Lord High-Admirals

of <hi>August</hi> 1666. to suspend the Execution of the said Letters Patents, <hi>protem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore.</hi>
Notwithstanding his Royal Highness was gratified with a Months Tax
for his Heroick Courage at Sea.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:98727:4"/>In the year 1667. a Peace was concluded at <hi>Breda,</hi> whereby all Letters of
Reprisals were mentioned to be revoked, whereupon the said <hi>Carew</hi> and the
Creditors remained passive, until the year 1671. when another War was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed,
the King having particularly owned this Cause, declaring, <hi>That he
was obliged in Iustice and Honour to see that Debt and Damages, mentioned in the
Letters Patents aforesaid, to be satisfied and repaired;</hi> the Lords of the Privy
Council having also affirmed, That all past Treaties were absolutely can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled,
as if no such Treaties ever had been made.</p>
            <p>Then the said <hi>Carew</hi> was dispatcht away with Orders of the Councel Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
Referrences and Instructions, with the Kings Letters to his Ambassadors
and Plenipotentiaries, to insist upon plenary satisfaction and Reparation in
any Treaty to be made with the States; The King expressing in his Leters
under his Sign manuall his care to protect his Subjects in their just Rights,
as well as to assist them in the recovery thereof.</p>
            <p>In the Month of <hi>August</hi> 1672. It so hapned that <hi>Carew</hi> and his Servants
were Imprisoned by the States of <hi>Holland</hi> as Spies, for seeking after Justice,
and detained close Prisoners without access (and threatned with Death) du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the War, which ended in a common Alliance, in the year 1674. upon
the consideration of <hi>Eight hundred Thousand Patacoons (inter alia)</hi> to be paid to
the King in four years, for Damages yet three parts thereof were assigned
to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and the fourth part received for other services by Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derman
<hi>Backwel,</hi> upon his Majesties account, but the Debt and Damages as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certained
for the Spoils and Depredations aforesaid, was left in <hi>statu quo,</hi> to the
remedy at Law prescribed.</p>
            <p>In the year 1680. divers of the Creditors of Sir <hi>William Courten,</hi> Sir <hi>Paul
Pindar</hi> and Sir <hi>Edward Littleton,</hi> having importuned the said <hi>Carew</hi> to put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
the said Letters of Reprisals, since they had no satisfaction either out
of the Prizes taken by the Kings Ships, during the War, nor out of the said
<hi>Patacoons,</hi> or any other waies or means whatsoever, notwithstanding their
several Addresses to the <hi>King,</hi> the <hi>States,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> for that
purpose.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Carew</hi> being advised that several Writs at Common Law, in case of a
Spoil at Sea, lay against the Subjects of Forraign Princes and their Goods
found in <hi>England,</hi> until the Statute of <hi>Edw.</hi> the third, provided that the only
Remedy should be by the Law of Marque or Reprisals, without Fraud or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
for all Damages upon Spoils, which being ascertained and reduced into
a Grant, under the Great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> became such an Interest vested in
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98727:5"/>
the Grantees, coupled with an Authority that could not be taken away with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
satisfaction made to the Parties interessed and injured.</p>
            <p>And further advised, That Soveraign Princes in all parts of the World, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
once granted such Letters of Reprisals for Spoils and Wrongs done to
their Subjects, hold themselves obliged to see right done by one means or
other, being trusted with the power of Peace and War: A Prerogative sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servient
to the immutable Laws of Nature, and right Reason.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Carew</hi> Equipped out a small Ship called the <hi>George Bona Adventura,</hi>
under the command of Captain <hi>Compton Gwyther,</hi> who took a Fly-Boat laden
with Wine and Chesnuts near the <hi>Isle of Wight,</hi> called the <hi>Love of Rotterdam,</hi>
to awaken those that ought to make reparations, whereupon the <hi>Dutch</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador
moved for <hi>Proclamations, Supersedeas</hi> and <hi>scire facias,</hi> but nothing was
offered for satisfaction or repairation upon any account whatsoever, for the
Debt of 151612 l. although no part of that principal money, or of ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
pounds more expended and disbursed by the said <hi>George Carew,</hi> in the
prosecution of his right, was recovered or received, as by his Affidavit
filed in <hi>Chancery,</hi> hereunto annexed also appears.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Compton Gwyther</hi> and his Mariners, being Apprehended were tryed for
Pyracy and Fellony, by a special Commission of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer,</hi> grounded
upon the Statute of <hi>Henry</hi> the VIII. at the New Hall, in the Court of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shalsea
in <hi>Southwark,</hi> on the 18th. of <hi>Febr.</hi> 1680. where the Jury acquitted
them as not acting with a Fellonious intent, under the colour of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
for Reprisals, Yet the Ship was restored by the King to the <hi>Dutch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Month following Sir <hi>Robert Sawyer,</hi> the Attorney General, brought a
<hi>scire facias</hi> in the Pettibag against Sir <hi>Edmund Turner,</hi> and <hi>George Carew,</hi> to
shew cause Why the LETTERS PATENTS should not be revoked, repeald,
or made null and void; Whereupon <hi>Slings by Bethel</hi> and <hi>Henry Cornish</hi> Esquires,
the Sheriffs, gave personal notice, and returned the said VVrit in Easter Term
1681. Then <hi>Turnor</hi> and <hi>Carew</hi> Appeared and Pleaded the same Term, which
lay Dormant until Easter-Term, 1682. when the Attorney General put in a
<hi>Demurrer:</hi> whereunto the Defendants rejoyned, and the Record being Read
in Court (consisting of five large Skins of Parchment) on <hi>Saturday</hi> the 20 of
<hi>May,</hi> the Lord High Chancellor of <hi>England,</hi> appointed <hi>Tuesday</hi> following to
Argue the same; whereupon the Defendants Councel moved the Court for
longer time, in regard they could not have Copies of the Record VVritten
out so soon, yet it was denied; and his Lordship gave Judgment for the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98727:5"/>
King, without Arguing the same by the Defendants Councel, who will in
due time be ready to make appear not only divers Errors in the said <hi>Scire
facias.</hi> But that Judgment ought not by the Laws of the Land, to be given
on the said <hi>scire facias:</hi> his Lordships Judgment being reversable by Writ
of Error or Appeal.</p>
            <p>But in the Interval, between the <hi>scire facias</hi> brought and the <hi>Demurrer</hi> put
in, <hi>Carew</hi> being pressed to enter other Ships and Pinnaces (according to his
Covenants) to Reprise some part of the Debt and Dammages, many Widdows
and Orphants Creditors of <hi>Courten</hi> and <hi>Pindar,</hi> being concerned therein; The
Ship named the <hi>America,</hi> with 4 others, were offer'd, at their instance, to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
in the <hi>Admiralty,</hi> and Cap. <hi>W. Hawley</hi> to be Commander of the <hi>America.</hi> But
Sir <hi>R. Lloyd</hi> &amp; Mr. <hi>Bedford</hi> refusing to take any other Notice of the Paper, than
only Reading and returning the same, it was Registred in the <hi>Chancery,</hi> and a
Deputation given to the said Cap. <hi>Hawley</hi> upon an Authentick Copy of the
said Letters Patents to put the same in Execution; who in Prosecution
thereof, took a Fly-boat laden with <hi>Wheat</hi> and <hi>Rye,</hi> called the <hi>Young Schone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker
of Dort,</hi> under Sayl about three Leagues from the <hi>Texell,</hi> and then
brought the same into <hi>Woodbridge</hi> Harbour, and sent the Bills of Lading with
all the Papers on Board unto Mr. <hi>Thomas Broadrick</hi> Procter in the Admiralty,
in order to a Sentence of Condemnation. Then a Warrant dated 29th of
<hi>April</hi> 1682. issued from the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, directed
to Mr. <hi>William Ioynes</hi> the Marshal, who restored the Prize to the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and
apprehended Captain <hi>Hawley</hi> and his Men for Pyracy and Fellony, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
them to the Prison of the <hi>Marshalsea,</hi> in order to their Tryal on <hi>Saturday</hi>

            <head>An Exact Account of the Proceedings at
the Marshalsea, June 10: 1682. against Cap: Hawley, and
his men, upon Pretence of Piracy, acting under Letters
Patents for Reprisals against the Hollanders.</head>
            <p>ON the 10th of <hi>Iune</hi> instant, the Commissioners appointed to try Capt.
<hi>Hawley</hi> and his men, upon the Stat. of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. for <hi>Paracy</hi> &amp; <hi>Fellony.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
met at the New Hall in the Marshals Court in <hi>Southwark.</hi> The
Commission was read by Mr. <hi>Tho. Bedford,</hi> the Register of the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty,
Sir <hi>Tho. Exton,</hi> as President of the Court, gave the Charge: Then the
Sheriff of <hi>Surry</hi> brought in the Precepts, whereupon the Jurors were return'd
and Sworn: The Indictment then was delivered to the Grand Jury who found
the Bill. Unto which the Prisoners pleaded, NOT GUILTY, Took
their Tryal, and put themselves upon God and the Country.</p>
            <p>Then Sir <hi>Richard Lloyd,</hi> Council for the King, alleadged to the Petty
Jury that the Letters Patents for Reprisals, aforesaid, were made null and void
by Treaty of STATE, <hi>Supercedeas, Proclamation,</hi> and <hi>Iudgment</hi> of the L<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor
upon a <hi>Scire facias:</hi> Yet was so tender of the KING's Honour, That he
would not suffer the Letters Patents to be read openly in Court, but only by
the Jurors thmselves privately. Whereupon the Council for the Prisoners
insisted, That there were not Arguments suffered to be made on the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants
side, upon the Atturney Generals <hi>Demurrer</hi> to the Defendants Plea,
which consisted of 5 Skins of Parchment: the Record being read on <hi>Saturday</hi> the
20th of <hi>May,</hi> Judgment was given in the Week following, before Copies could
be made of the Record. However Mr. <hi>Carew</hi> himself persisted, at this last
Tryal, That nothing could affect the Patent but Satisfaction: For That by
the Laws &amp; Statutes of <hi>England,</hi> Letters Patents in this Case, which vested an
Interest in the Patentees, by especial Grant (as set forth in his Plea to the <hi>sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
facias</hi>) could not be revok'd or taken away without satisfaction first made
to the parties that suffered the wrong. And that the L<hi>
                  <hi rend="sup">d</hi>
               </hi> Chancellors Judgment
is as avoidable upon a Writ of Error for Mistakes in his Opinion, as the Grants
in the Letters Patents are avoidable upon Satisfaction made: for that no Act
of State (unless an Act of Parliament) can bind the particular Interests of the
Subject without Satisfaction: and the <hi>scire facias</hi> being defective, the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
given upon it, is null in it self, there being no such Letters Patents as
are mentioned in the <hi>Scire facias,</hi> returned by the Sheriffs, as aforesaid, for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
to <hi>Carolo tunc Comiti Salop,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Then the matters of Fact being made out by the Dutch men the Master &amp;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98727:7"/>
others in the Ship call'd the <hi>Schonemaker</hi> of <hi>Dort,</hi> against Cap. <hi>Hawley</hi> and his
men, That they took the ship by force, and possest themselves of the Ship and
Lading. To which the Prisoners made little Defence, save only, That they did
nothing felloniously or pyratically, but acted by Virtue of a Commission and
Deputation indorsed upon the back-side of an Authentick Copy of the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
Patents, hereunto annexed, which was put into the Jurors hands to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>use;
who brought them in <hi>Not Guilty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Werereupon Mr. <hi>Ioynes</hi> the Marshal, immediately arested Mr. <hi>Carew,</hi> Capt.
<hi>Hawley,</hi> and his men in a joynt Action for 1000l. Dammages, by Writ out of
the Admiralty, upon the Dutch Ambassadors desire, at the Suit of <hi>Willem de
Widt, Iohanes van Eich voor, Alewyn van Vollenhoven, Lodewyck Terwe, Iacob van
Harrlem, Antony Walbeeck, Antony van d Santheuvel,</hi> all Inhabitants of <hi>Dort,</hi>
that were the Owners of the said ship and lading; but upon Mr. <hi>Carew's</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
to the Court, then sitting, and the Dutch Ambassador also present,
he was discharged <hi>pro tempore.</hi> But within two days after gave sufficient
Bail by two eminent Citizens to answer the said Action both for himself, the
Capt. and his Company.</p>
            <p>Then some of the most considerable Creditors claiming under <hi>Carew</hi>'s Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration
being unsatisfied with these Proceedings, caused Mr. <hi>Ioynes</hi> to be
arested by Writ out of the King's Bench for 2000l. Dammages, to answer the
Value of the said Ship and Lading: having dispossest the said Cap. <hi>Hawly,</hi> and
his men thereof, in an extrajudicial way, upon pretence of a VVarrant from
the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, dated about the 29 of <hi>April</hi>
1682. who brought the said Cap. and his men Prisoners, and put them into
the custody of Mr. <hi>Lowman,</hi> the Keeper of the County Gaol in <hi>Southwark,</hi>
where they were detained 44 dayes, or thereabouts, close Prisoners at their
own costs and charges, and after they were legally discharged, wereforced
to pay Mr. <hi>Ioynes</hi> and the Register of the Admiralty, several exorbitant Fees,
amounting to 6l. 10 s. a man, or thereabouts; to procure which Money, they
were forc'd to fell their Beds from under them: For all which the Captain
and his men are advised to take their due Course at Law against them for
their respective Dammages: That is to say, Cap. <hi>Wil. Hawley, Richard Washington,
Ri. Terret, Ierom Hawley, Th. Tomkins, Iohn Tayler,</hi> and <hi>Glanvil Lamboy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>☞ ☞ Its Remarkable, That the Dutch Ambassadors are very clamorous
at Court, upon any Complaint of the Hollanders, whose ships and goods
are suddenly restored right or wrong, although they refuse to appear for the
Heirs and Executors of <hi>Ia. Pergens</hi> of <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> &amp; <hi>Pet: Boudaen</hi> of <hi>Middleburgh,</hi>
who have got into their hands and Possessions the Effects of Sir <hi>W. Courtens,</hi> &amp;
Sir <hi>Paul Pindars</hi> Estates to the value of 138000l. owing upon Accounts of
Bills of Exchange, Moneys lent upon Obligations, and Goods exported out
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:98727:7"/>
of <hi>England</hi> in Trade of Partners-ship, wherein divers great summs of Mony
were taken up at Interest<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and imployed in that Trade, and are still standing
out and due to divers Orphants and VViddows whose Crys have reached
the Heavens, and fallen down with Inundations upon their Country, for
Justice in those Civil matters, wherein the States of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealand</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tects
the Persons and Estates of the Heirs and Executors of the said <hi>Pergens</hi>
and <hi>Boudaen</hi> from common Justice, under the Pretence of Treaties of Peace
and common Alliance between the King and the States General, although
they never came under the Consideration of any publick Treaty, as the spoils
and depredations of the Ships <hi>Bona Esperanza</hi> an <hi>Bona Adventura</hi> did. And
that which cannot be mentioned without Grief and Astonishment, is that the
Complaints of the oppress'd Creditors concerning the civil Causes of Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
depending in <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealand</hi> against <hi>Pergens</hi> and <hi>Boudaen</hi> leys before
the Secretaries and principal ministers of State at <hi>Whitehall</hi> for relief, without
any effectual Answer, although earnestly solicited for many years together.

<hi>Goa</hi> and <hi>Maccao</hi> in the Streights of <hi>Malacca,</hi> deprived

her Tackle, Apparel &amp; Furniture, and all the Goods and Lading in her, upon a
very hopeful Trading Voyage to <hi>China,</hi> which were carried to <hi>Batavia,</hi> and there
all <hi>de facto,</hi> without due Process of Law confiscated: and that also in the said

seized upon by some of the Officers and Ministers, and others under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of the said <hi>East-India</hi> Company, and utterly deteined from the right Ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.
And whereas the said <hi>William Courten,</hi> and his Assigns in his life-time,
used all possible Endeavours to recover the said Ships and Goods, and to
procure further Iustice against the Malefactors, and yet could obtain no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
or Satisfaction, whereby they became to be much distressed and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
undone in their Estate and Credit: and that thereupon, and upon the

            <p>THat King <hi>Charles</hi> the First, found it necessary to put Sir <hi>William Courten,</hi> and
his Partners, upon Trading Voyages to the <hi>East-Indies, China</hi> and <hi>Japan,</hi> unto
whom he gave a <hi>Charter</hi> under the great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> for the prosecution
thereof in the Year 1635.</p>
            <p>That his said Majesty incouraged Sir <hi>Paul Pindar,</hi> and others, to advance divers great
Sums of Money, as Adventurers in that Expedition and Enterprize.</p>
            <p>That Sir <hi>Edward Littleton,</hi> and others Interessed before the Kings most happy Restora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(being under the Notion of Delinquents and Sequestration) durst not appear openly
against the States and their Subjects for Common Iustice, concerning satisfaction and reparation
for the Spoyles and Depredations.</p>
            <p>That Sir <hi>William Courten</hi> and Sir <hi>Paul Pindar,</hi> strained their Credits so far by borrowing
several great Sums of Money, both of Natives and Strangers to carry on this affair, That
there is not a <hi>County</hi> nor <hi>Corporation</hi> in <hi>England;</hi> Wherein there are not either Original
Creditors, or their Relations at this time Complaining for their Debts.</p>
            <p>It is inconsistent with the Honour and Interest of the King, and Kingdom, (under all the
Circumstances attending this Case) to let the History of such Oppression remain upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
when the Creditors have made their humble Proposals to his Majesty, that Lyes before
the <hi>Lords Commissioners of the Treasury,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Secretary Jenkins</hi> for relief upon easie
Terms, even out of the Foundations that Sir <hi>William Courten,</hi> and Sir <hi>Paul Pindar</hi> laid.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Royal Word of a KING</hi> being past, and confirmed under his <hi>Great Seal,</hi> That
his Grant should not be Obliterated, until Satisfaction and Reparation to the Grantees in
this Case; there ought to be an Inquiry made, Whether the Parties Grieved be Satisfied and
Repaired, and also that they may be duly heard, before this Grant be any ways called in, by Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
or Officers of State, to be Cancelled and made Null. It being repugnant to the Laws of
God, the Laws of Nature, the Statutes of this Realm, and even against the Laws of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Humanity, that a particular Interest (so ascertained and secured) should be taken away
from Private persons for a Common Good, and not be Satisfyed and Repaired, either out of
the Publick Purse, or suffered to Reprise their Satisfaction and Reparation, for the Wrongs
and Injuries done them, by the Subjects of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealand,</hi> without the Danger of

            <p>I. It is therefore humbly proposed, That His Majesty should, in lieu thereof,
grant and assign the 4 and <hi>½ per cent,</hi> arising out of the <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> and the
<hi>Careebe Islands,</hi> and the wast Lands there, to certain Trustees, for the use and
benefit of <hi>William Courten,</hi> Grand-child and Heir of Sir <hi>William Courten,</hi> and
the Creditors of his Father and Grand-father, who were the Original Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors
of the Island of <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> whereof they were dispoiled by <hi>Iames,</hi> late
Earl of <hi>Carlisle,</hi> and his Adherents; to the insupportable Damages of Sir

            <p>That in Contemplation of Sir <hi>Paul Pyndar</hi>'s great Services and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
for the Crown of <hi>England;</hi> and more particularly, for the vast sums
of Money lent to the late King, <hi>Charles I,</hi> amounting to the sum of <hi>One
hundred and thirty thousand Pounds,</hi> upon the Allom-Farm, Sugar-Farm,
Collectors of the <hi>Papists</hi> Compositions in the Northern Counties, and
other Branches of the Revenue; which were diverted in the late trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som
times to other uses, leaving Sir <hi>Paul Pyndar</hi>'s Assignments unsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied,
and many of his Creditors undone.</p>
            <p>II. It is therefore humbly proposed, That there may be a Privy-Seal granted
for Fifty thousand Pounds upon the Reference from His Majesty, that lies
before the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury to be raised out of the said
Papists Estates (at the instance and Petition of <hi>Richard Powel</hi> 
               <abbr>Esq</abbr> and <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaniel
Hill</hi> Gent.) upon their old Compositions in the eleven Northern
Counties, as they paid under the Collection of <hi>Thomas,</hi> Viscount <hi>Wentworth,</hi>
in the year 1638. which they are willing now to satisfie accordingly.</p>

of <hi>Jacob Pergens</hi> of <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> and <hi>Peter Boudaen</hi> of <hi>Middleburgh</hi>
in <hi>Zealand,</hi> that belongs to the Estates of Sir <hi>William Courten</hi> and Sir
<hi>Paul Pyndar,</hi> upon Bills of Exchange, Obligations for Money lent, and
private Contracts in Trade and Merchandizing, amounting to the sum of
<hi>One hundred and twenty thousand Pounds,</hi> and upwards: Whereupon
there are Actions depending in the ordinary Courts of Iudicature in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
and <hi>Zealand,</hi> ready for Sentences, and final Decrees; wherein Iustice
is positively denyed, upon vain pretences of extinguishments and mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
by Treaties of common Amity and Alliance.</p>
            <p>III. It is most humbly proposed, That His Majesty would be graciously plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
effectually to recommend the Petition of the Creditors, that lies before
the Lord <hi>Conaway</hi> to that purpose, for speedy satisfaction to be made there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,

upon the <hi>Scire facias,</hi> and Pleadings relating to the Letters Patents for Repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zals,
without hearing <hi>Counsel</hi> of the other side: It's necessary that you should

by his Letters Patents under the Great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> in the year 1635 gave Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
Courten</hi> and his Partners a Charter to Trade and settle Factories in the <hi>East-Indies,

and converted the same to their own use, without any legal Process, contrary to

granted to Sir <hi>William Powel</hi> Baronet; and Letters of Administration of the Goods and

due form of Law, granted to the said <hi>George Carew,</hi> who <hi>(bona fide)</hi> paid and satisfied the

but no restitution or reparation could be obtained; Whereupon the said Letters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
were granted for the recovery of <hi>151612 l.</hi> with Costs and Damages, under those

this weight and consequence, being a noble Case to be debated and argued, both in

Judgment; and that they might <hi>argue by the Spirit,</hi> if they would. So his Lordship
informing the Court that he had studied the Case himself; And for the satisfaction of all

            <p>On the next morning the Lord Chancellor was pleased in open Court to

Judgment; and that the Clerk of the Pety-Bag should enter it upon the
Roll, aud exemplifie the whole Record, under the Great Seal, and send it to
the Admiralty-Court, to remain there.</p>
            <p>It may be observed, That the <hi>Scire facias</hi> being returned in <hi>Easter</hi>-Term 1681. and
the <hi>Plea</hi> filed of the same Term, and the <hi>Demurrer</hi> coming in not before <hi>Easter</hi> Term
last: the Attorney-General had a whole year to consider of the said <hi>Plea,</hi> which is
admitted as to the matters of Fact in all particulars by the said <hi>Demurrer,</hi> and since
sworn to be true by one of the Defendants: So that the Attorney-General making no
Reply, insisted only upon the Law. The Questions therefore that do naturally arise
upon it, are, Whether the <hi>Scire facias</hi> be a Legal and warrantable Writ in this Case
for the Lord Chancellor to ground his Judgment upon, for repealing the Letters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents,
(without satisfaction) so solemnly obtained under the Great Seal of <hi>England,</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:98727:14"/>
according to the Laws of the Land? or, Whether the <hi>Plea</hi> be not sufficient in Law to
support and maintain the Letters Patents, until the Debt and Damages be recovered?</p>
            <p>BUt before we come to answer the Lord Chancellor's Arguments, it's absolutely
necessary to speak a word or two concerning the <hi>Scire facias,</hi> and the Order entred
by the Register, that the Defendents should bring the Letters Patents, and all Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifications
and Duplicates thereof, under Seal into Court, to be cancelled.</p>
            <p>It's recited in the Record made up, <hi>pro restitut' faciend'</hi> Carolo <hi>tunc Comiti</hi> Salop, <hi>&amp;


al' in eisdem Literis Patent'</hi> &amp;c. whereas there is no such Patent as is mentioned in the
<hi>Scire facias.</hi> Notwithstanding, it's affirmed in the said Order of the <hi>26th.</hi> of <hi>May</hi>
1682. That his Lordship had been attended with the Record, and duly considered the
whole matter; and yet in the second Line of the said Record it's written, <hi>Carolo tunc
Comitis Salop;</hi> whereas in the Letters Patents for Reprizals it's mentioned for restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to be made to <hi>Francis</hi> Earl of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> and others; So that the Foundation
being bad, the Structure must fall to the Ground: there being no such Patent as the <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re

all the Lands and Tenements of <hi>George Carew</hi> within his Bayliwick, until the said
Patent, Exemplifications and Duplicates thereof, under Seal, be brought into Court,
and cancelled; which is impossible for him to do, being out of his power; the said
Duplicates and Exemplifications being in the hands of several Persons beyond the Seas,
with Assignments and Covenants that they shall continue effectual in Law, until the
Debt of 151612 <hi>l.</hi> with Damages, shall be recovered and received, according to the
words of the Grant, and the King's Declaration. Wherefore, it would be both Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and Just for any Ministers of State in <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Holland,</hi> to bring the <hi>Scire facias</hi>
in one hand, and Money to satisfie the Debt and Damages in the other; And without
that <hi>Quid pro quo,</hi> (under his Lordship's favour) the Patent cannot be legally revoked,
repealed, or made void.</p>
            <p>Yet for satisfaction of all Mankind, that the Defendents will abide by their <hi>Plea,</hi>
they have retained their Councel to give modest Answers to the Lord Chancellor's Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
as followeth; who holds it convenient to begin at the root, where his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
ended.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="part">
            <head>That the Clause of continuance was unusual, and incerted by surprize, and
ought not to have been, and is in no sort obligatory.</head>
            <p>1. The stipulation for extinguishing all other Losses and Damages by the Treaty
1662. from the like Sovereign Remedies. 2. The States denyal of making satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for the Spoils and Depredations of those two Ships, according to the said stipulation.
3. The Services and Sufferings of <hi>Courten</hi> and <hi>Pyndar</hi> for the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> so
eminently known to all Parts of the World 4. And the great Supplies given to His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
in Parliament, for the Protection of His Subjects at the very time the said Patent
for Reprizals was passing through Sir <hi>Heneage Finch's</hi> Office, when he was Solicitor-General,
(upon the Negotiation of Mr. <hi>Gilbort Crouch)</hi> were four invincible Arguments
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:98727:15"/>
for the King to pass this Grant of common Right, to his Subjects, with those two Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of a <hi>continuando</hi> until the Debt 151612 <hi>l.</hi> wi<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h Costs and Damages, should be reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
and received; the King having declared so much in his Speech to both Houses of
Parliament, and expressed in the very body of the Patent, (in these words) <hi>For relief of
Our said Subjects, whom We take Our selves in Honour and Iustice concernd
to be satisfied and re-paid</hi> So that the King declares Himself equally Great and Just.
Therefore, neither surprized nor deceived in this Grant of Reprizals, that had passed
the Test of all the chief Officers of State and Trust in the Kingdom, whose Judgments
are Arraigned, by questioning the validity of the said Grant.</p>
            <p>The reasons are very obvious to all Mankind, that the Patent ought to be so worded,
<hi>until the Debt and Damages shall be recovered and received;</hi> for that there is no other
remedy for the Subjects relief, but such Grants, grounded upon the Law of <hi>Marque,</hi>
after Justice denied in the Case of a Spoil.</p>
            <p>This Clause of continuance distinguisheth between general and particular Reprizals;
the one being an Act of War, the other a Process at Law, and out of the King's Power
to obstruct the restitution of this Debt and Damages to the persons interessed, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured
otherwise the remedy would prove a Grievance, after such vast Expences in as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaining
the Debt and Damages according to the Rules of Law, if the Grant should
not be obligatory.</p>
            <p>It is in the Power of the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> or the King, to satisfie this Debt and Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages,
to make good the King's own words, and preserve His Honour and Justice en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire,
which ought to be kept Sacred and Inviolable; And if the King cannot pardon
the least Trespass, when sued for reparation in the ordinary Course of Law: <hi>à fortiori,</hi>
He cannot pardon a Spoil after a Judicial Grant to recover it according to the Laws and
Statutes of the Realm.</p>
            <p>General Letters of <hi>Marque,</hi> in time of War, are ambulatory, and revokable at
Pleasure, being usually granted to all persons in all Nations that will ask for the same,
to weaken the Enemy; as they did at <hi>Oast-End, Dunkirk, Flushen</hi> and <hi>Diep,</hi> in the
times of War between <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>England, France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
and those are called <hi>Privatters,</hi> or <hi>Private men of War,</hi> of whom the Lord High-Admiral
hath a tenth part of all Prizes; And these are the Letters of <hi>Marque<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> the
Lord Chancellor so often mentions in his Arguments; whereof there are hundreds of
Precedents in the Courts of Admiralty in <hi>England, Holland, France</hi> and <hi>Spain;</hi> which
are Temporary Grants, and determinable at Pleasure, or certain days prefixt under
the Seal of the Admiralty.</p>
            <p>By the sacred prescriptions in Holy Writ, restitution is to be made double the value
of the property injuriously taken, which implies the Charge of Prosecution; and if the
Trespasser, be not able to satisfie, he shall be Sold for his Theft, or kept for a Ransom:
Upon this ground the old Writs in the Register, and <hi>F. N. B</hi> were made, and our
Ancestors were so careful for the preservation of every <hi>English-mans</hi> Right and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty,
and the encouragement of Navigation and Commerce; That Merchants Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
resident in <hi>England,</hi> and their Goods were Arrested by those Writs, for satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Injuries done at Sea by the People of that Kingdom or Nation, that did the
wrong, whereof they were <hi>Subjects.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But upon the Petition of the Merchants, Staplers, and others to the Parliament,
in the <hi>27th.</hi> of <hi>Edw. 3. c.</hi> 17. The force of those Writs were taken away, and it was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:98727:15"/>
and Enacted by the same Parliament, That all Persons Spoyled at Sea, shall have
the Law of <hi>Marque,</hi> without fraud or deceipt, that is of taking the value of the Loss
and Damage again.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bracton</hi> Says, <hi>Quod nihil aliud potest Rex in terris cum sit Minister Dei, &amp; Vicarius;
quam solum quod de jure potest.</hi> Every Man hath a Right to Justice; and every Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of <hi>England</hi> having a Fundamental property in his Goods, and a Fundamental li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of his Person. It is repugnant to the Laws of God, Religion and Property, to
take away our Goods (for reason of <hi>State)</hi> without price or satisfaction: he is not
a Subject, but a Slave that suffers his Substance to be taken from him against his
Will Infinite are the Arguments that may be used, and deduced from the Law of
Reason and Natural Justice, in the vindication of this Patent: However, its neccessary
to answer the Lord Chancellour <hi>Gradatim</hi> to his Arguments, aforesaid,</p>
         </div>
         <div type="part">
            <head>His Lordship was pleased to say, That the Chancery had an Admiral
Iurisdiction, by the Statute 31. Hen. 6. cap. 4. for the speedy
relief of Strangers Robbed at Sea, by the Kings Subjects.</head>
            <p>His Lordship would here beg the question, and have all Mankind to take it for
granted, That those who Act under this His Majesties Royal Charter and Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
are <hi>Robbers</hi> and <hi>Theeves:</hi> Notwithstanding the express words in the Patent, That
it shall be lawful for them to recover the said Debt and Damages, although a
Peace for General Reprizals (concerning the Dominion of the Sea) should be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded.</p>
            <p>Its true, the said Statute of <hi>Hen</hi> 6. provides a remedy for those that have safe
Conduct, and are Robbed by the Kings Subjects. The Lord Chancellour calling to
him, any of the Judges of either Bench, who upon Bill of Complaint, shall cause
Restitution to be made of Ships and Goods to the parties grieved. This Statute may
be still in Force, but not practicable, since the Odious and Arbitrary power of the
Admiralty Court was taken away by the Statute of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. in the <hi>28th.</hi> year of his
Reign, for Tryal of Piracy by Jurors, according to the course of the Common Law.
However the Statute of <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. recited by his Lordship, comes not to this case upon
the <hi>Scire Facias.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But its enacted and ordained, by the Statute made in the <hi>20th.</hi> year of <hi>Hen. 6. cap.
1:</hi> And several other Statutes of this Realm: That all Letters of safe Conduct, Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and Leagues of Amity and Alliance, shall be Inrolled of Record in Chancery, or
else not to be of any Force or Effect in the Law.</p>
            <p>And the Treaty at <hi>Breda</hi> being not Inrolled, or made any matter of Record in
Chancery, whereby the Kings Subjects might have recourse thereunto; cannot any
ways affect this grant to <hi>Turnor</hi> and <hi>Carew:</hi> And many proper Officers have lost
their Heads in former ages, for their miscarriages; not inrolling in due time such
publick Treaties, Leagues and Alliances.</p>
            <p>Its also true as the Lord Chancellour observes, the Letters Patents to <hi>Turnor</hi> and
<hi>Carew,</hi> were granted in time of War, (for an injury done to private Persons in time of
peace,) but provided that no Subsequent peace should affect it, without a recovery
or satisfaction to be made for the Debt and Damages: either by force of the Grant,
or Composition made with the Persons interessed. The <hi>Fiat</hi> passed in the month of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:98727:16"/>
May 1665. But the proceedings that brought it to that conclusion, continued <hi>de die
in diem,</hi> ever since the Treaty of Alliance, made in the year 1662. Wherein it was
concluded and agreed, That the said Debt and Damages so assertained and Liquida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
should be satisfied and repayed.</p>
            <p>Yet admitting this Treaty at <hi>Breda</hi> concluded upon the surprize of <hi>Chattam,</hi> had
been duly Inrolled, and made a matter of Record in Chancery: It was afterwards can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled,
disanulled, and openly extinguished by Proclamation, in the year 1672. And
particularly signified to His Majesty by a report, upon a reference to five Lords of the
Council Table, concerning the Debt and Damages mentioned in the Letters Patents
aforesaid; In these words, <hi>That the</hi> States General <hi>having wholly cancelled all past Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and Agreements, and left your Majesty and your Subjects as free in all iustice and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
as if they never had been made: We therefore humbly presume to report our Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
to your Majesty, that it is now but just and seasonable for your Majesty, to insist upon
reparation for the Debt and Damages aforesaid:</hi> This reference was made to the Lord
<hi>Arlington,</hi> Lord <hi>Ashley,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Clifford,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Trevor,</hi> and Sir <hi>Iohn Duncomb,</hi> by
Order of Council 22. of <hi>March</hi> 1671. Now whether a Treaty never Inrolled, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
Cancelled by Order of Council, and Proclamation should be properly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
upon, in any Judicial Writs, is fit for another Court of Judicature, or Parliament
to resolve.</p>
            <p>It's granted, that after a peace concluded, all Temporary Letters of <hi>Marque</hi> having
a bare Authority in themselves, are for reasons of <hi>State</hi> totally Extinguished, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
those Letters of <hi>Marque</hi> had not an Authority coupled with an Interest.</p>
            <p>A general Letter of <hi>Marque</hi> or <hi>Reprizal,</hi> as before it's said, is an Act of War; A
particular or Especial one is a process at Law, which is our case.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Letters of safe conduct, usually granted to Foreign Ambassadors, and other Persons:</hi>
Upon Emergent occasions are in the nature of a <hi>Supersedeas</hi> to any Commander (that
hath a Commission or general Letter of <hi>Marque)</hi> or Privateer, so properly called as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
nor shall they be interrupted by any Person that hath a speciall Commission
grounded upon the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Marque;</hi> and this is consonant to reason of State, and the
<hi>Law</hi> of Nations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And it is not denyed but that a Truce between Enemies supersedes all Temporary Letters of
Marque,</hi> being Acts of War, but not special Letters of <hi>Marque</hi> or <hi>Reprisals</hi> which take
their rise from Spoyls &amp; Depredations committed in times of Peace upon particular men
or Companies, that becomes a personal injury. And the reason is plain, for that the Law
of <hi>Marque</hi> and Grants thereupon, are consistent with times of Peace, and the strictest
Amity and Alliance, between Sovereign Princes and States. Captions thereupon
being in the nature of Seizures in a hundred for a Robbery upon a private person before
Sun-set, which comes to a common Average to prevent a failer of Justice.</p>
            <p>It's observed that Sovereign Princes holds the Scepter in one hand and the Globe in
the other. The Sword is carried before them by some Chief Minister of State, to shew
that Justice is to be duely Administred by Officers that are accomptable for their mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages;
By the Law of <hi>England,</hi> the King can do no wrong. He is obliged by Oath
to protect His Subjects in their Rights, Properties and Estates; Therefore His Ministers
cannot take them away.</p>
            <p>Yet no man of sence will denie, but that the King for a publick good may by due
means and ways make void even the Letters Patents, in this case of Reprisal, that is
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:98727:16"/>
to say (as it's observed before) with Money in the right hand of a Lord Treasurer, <hi>Dutch</hi>
Embassador, or Lord Chancellor, and the <hi>Scire-facias</hi> in the left hand, for the Grantees
to shew cause (the Money being payed) why they should not bring the Letters Patents
into Court to be Cancel'd.</p>
            <p>Treaties of State if they be repugnant to the Law of God, the Law of Reason, or
the Laws and Statutes of <hi>England (ipso Facto,)</hi> they are void in themselves; The third
Article of the pretended Treaty at <hi>Breda,</hi> concluded in the year 1667. after the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
at <hi>Chatham,</hi> says that all Offences, Injuries, Damages and Losses sustained on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
side by the King or the States, or their Subjects during this War, <hi>or at any time
before upon any cause or pretence whatsoever, should be totally expunged and buried in O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blivion,
and all Actions at Law concerning the same.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if any forced Interpretation should be put upon this Article, (so generally Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned)
that all private differences of <hi>meum &amp; tuum,</hi> between particular persons of either
Nation should be comprehended in this Article, it's void, because its not in the Power or
Prerogative of any Prince to hinder the due course of Law for a particular debt or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal
injury. Admit that a <hi>Hollander</hi> were indebted to an <hi>English</hi>-man before the Treaty
at <hi>Breda</hi> for goods Sold or sent to make Sale of, and the <hi>Dutch</hi>-man should plead spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
the Treaty at <hi>Breda;</hi> in Bar to an Action brought for the Money, it would not
hold good in Law; for that it cannot be any ways intended that particular Debts and
Actions should fall under the considerations of such Offences, Injuries, Losses and Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages
mentioned in that Article which generally relates to Kings and States.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As for Mr.</hi> Carew, <hi>his Plea to the</hi> Scire Facias, <hi>and Affidavit annexed, speaks suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
for his Justification:</hi> Persisting, That no restitution is made for the 151612 l. or any
part thereof; although Sir <hi>James Butler</hi> and others are ravishing his Estate from him, upon
Fore-closures of Equity, even for Moneys lent upon account of prosecuting this Cause.</p>
            <p>There was never such a president since the Creation, that a particular Interest and
Property so Liquidated and Established for satisfaction and reparation (under those cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances)
according to the Laws and Statutes of this Realm; wherein so many Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
are concerned, as the Creditors of Sir <hi>William Courten</hi> and his Son, Sir <hi>Paul Pynder</hi>
and Sir <hi>Edward Littleton</hi> should be so slighted and contemned</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Lord Chancellor well observed it concerned the publique,</hi> it's very true it concerns the
publick Honour and Interest, the publick Justice and Equity of the Nation, that the
Debt and Damages should be satisfied and repayed.</p>
            <p>There is no <hi>Reason of State</hi> that particular persons should Purchase a publick Peace
at their own Charge, or that a private Interest should be Sacrificed for the publick good,
without satisfaction out of the Publick Purse.</p>
            <p>The Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> or <hi>Monpilier,</hi> cannot give Laws to the Parliament of
<hi>England,</hi> that enacted if any man should be spoiled by <hi>French</hi> or others at Sea, in
peaceable times they shall have the right and benefit of the Law of <hi>Marque</hi> or <hi>Repriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als,</hi>
to recover their Loss, Damages and incident Charges; which by consent of Nations
being once ascertained by a Judicial Act, must have its Extent, and Execution the end
of the Law <hi>(Satisfaction.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this being agreeable to the Laws of God, the Laws of Nature, the positive Laws
of Nations, and the Laws and Statutes of <hi>England,</hi> and the King having by His Letters
Patents, under the Great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> pursuant thereunto, commanded and required
all Judges of the Admiralty and Officers there for the time being, to be Aiding and
Assisting to <hi>Turnor</hi> and <hi>Carew,</hi> their Executors Administrators and Assigns, and to take
care that all things shall be favourably interpreted, and construed in all respects, to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:98727:17"/>
the benefit and best Advantage of the said <hi>Turnor</hi> and <hi>Carew,</hi> their Executors, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministrators
and Assigns; Witness himself at <hi>Westminster,</hi> the Letters were made
Patents the <hi>19th.</hi> day of <hi>May,</hi> in the <hi>17th.</hi> year of his Reign</p>
            <p>Now how the Actions and Proceedings of several Ministers and Officers of the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty
(and other Mercenary Mortals) do quadrare with the Kings Honour and Iustice,
(that have Issued out Warrants in the Kings name, to apprehend and seize the Persons and
Goods of his Majesties Subjects; detain them in Prison and Irons until they were Tryed, as
Fellons and Pyrats, for duly acting under his Majesties Royal Commission and Charter;
grounded upon the Laws and Statutes of <hi>England;</hi> Whereby they were found innocent and
accquitted. Yet afterwars detained for Exhorbitant and Extrajudicial Fees of Registers
and Marshalls of the Admiralty) is left to any Mankind to Iudge.</p>

for the defence thereof, granted to the King at several times, during the two last short Wars between <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
and <hi>Holland,</hi> the Sum of <hi>Five Millions Four Hundred and Forty Thousand Seven hundred and Fifty Pounds,
Eleven Shillings and Eight Pence Sterling Money;</hi> For extraordinary supplies toward the said Wars (whereof

            <p>That reason of State was depraved in the Lord Treasurer <hi>Danby,</hi> who parted with 600000 Pattacons (the price
of so much <hi>English</hi> Bloud and Treasure) out of <hi>England</hi> to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> that reaped the benefit of his

            <p>There was no necessity therefore for those great Ministers, <hi>H. Finch, C. S. Latimer, Ormond, Arlington, H.
