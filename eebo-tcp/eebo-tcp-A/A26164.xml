         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For proof of his great underſtanding
he taxes three <hi>Paragraphs</hi> of mine with

in his own mind.</p>
            <p>1. The firſt is,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Jani,</hi> &amp;c. p. 26.</note> that <hi>the City of</hi> Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
<hi>being charged with a Tallage, their
Common-Council diſpute whether it were</hi>
Tallagium, <hi>or</hi> Auxilium, <hi>which is there
meant of voluntary aid, not due upon
the account of their Houſes being of
of the Kings Demeaſn,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Quid,</hi> a new Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph.</note> 
               <hi>though indeed
'tis then ſhewn that they had ſeveral
times before been talliated. Quid eſt
quod in hâc Cauſâ defenſionis egeat?</hi> I
muſt needs ſay I take all this to be ſo
plain that I know not which part I
ought to add any light to. Is the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between <hi>Tallage</hi> and a <hi>Voluntary
Aid</hi> obſcure? Or is it not well known
that the Kings Demeaſns only were tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liated,
and that the City having been
talliated, 'twas in vain to urge that
they paid only voluntary Aid?</p>
            <p>But perhaps in the two next the <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity</hi>
may lye, and yet, by the Doctors
Art of multiplying faults, they may
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54561:3"/>
make <hi>three obſcure Paragraphs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. This explains that part of the
Charter,<note place="margin">He adds <hi>ſuch</hi> to Caſes, to render it obſcure.</note> 
               <hi>Simili modo fiat de Civitate
London,</hi> that is as in all Caſes beſides
thoſe excepted Eſcuage or Tallage ſhould
not be raiſed but by a Common-Council
of the Kingdom,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Jani,</hi> &amp;c. p. 26.</note> that is of all the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
concerned to pay; ſo for the City
of <hi>London,</hi> unleſs the Aid was ordered
in Common-Council, wherein they and
all other Tenants in chief were aſſembled,
none ſhould be laid upon any Citizens but
by the conſent of their own Common-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
<note place="margin">Na. So if a ſum in groſs were laid upon them.</note> and if the Ordinance were only in
general Terms, that all the Kings De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaſns
ſhould be talliated, the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
payable there ſhould be agreed by
the Common-Council of the City.</p>
            <p>This conſiſts of two parts; Firſt,
That where there was not the conſent
of a <hi>Common-Council</hi> of all the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents
in chief, the Citizens might of
themſelves give a <hi>Tallage,</hi> which is
not in diſpute between us, but is with
admirable ingenuity turned into an
aſſertion,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Viz.</hi> To ſuch pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as Tallage.</note> 
               <hi>that Cities and Burroughs
were not taxed or aſſeſſed towards any
payments, but by their own Common-Councils,</hi>
(which is not to be inferred
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54561:4"/>
from the priviledge of one City, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
it were ſo for <hi>London,</hi> nor can be
gathered from my words, which yield
that even <hi>London</hi> might be <hi>Taxt or
Aſſeſſed by the conſent</hi> of the <hi>Common-Council</hi>
of Tenents) <hi>or that they,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Againſt <hi>Jani,</hi> &amp;c. p. 113.</note> 
               <hi>as
part of the Common-Council of the
Land taxed themſelves,</hi> which is true;
but no man of ſenſe can underſtand that
to be the meaning of this part of the
<hi>Obſcure Paragraph,</hi> but that ſomething
farther was intended.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2. The ſecond I need not explain
ſince he underſtands, for all his affected
ignorance,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Indeed he would take in more places.</note> that after a Tax was impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon the City of <hi>London</hi> the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
<hi>(or thoſe who compoſed its
Council)</hi> met to proportion it, ſo as it
might be paid with as much equality as
could be.<note place="margin">Na. the King did perhaps re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a certain ſum after a general Ordinance made by the Council of Tenents for a <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionabile auxilium.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>This he yields to my hand, that <hi>they
always did if they would,</hi> it ſeems con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
by that Record, which ſhews
that when the Council of the City
would not agree to the Sum demanded
by the King, 'twas <hi>de voluntate omnium
Baronum noſtrorum Civitatis ejuſdem,</hi>
that the King talliated his Tenents <hi>per
ſe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Jani,</hi> &amp;c. p. 26.</note> or <hi>per Capita,</hi> ſo much upon every
head.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:54561:4"/>
3. This clears the laſt <hi>Paragraph</hi>
which I need not recite, it having no
meaning differing from the Record, but
if my Record give not ſufficient light
and ſtrength he, I thank him, according
to his uſual Curteſie cites one clear
enough.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dr.</hi> p. 115.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Et cum praedicti Cives noluiſſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trare
finem praedict' trium mille marca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
praedicti Theſ. &amp; alii voluerint
aſſidere illud Tal. per Capita.</p>
            <p>So that till the Citizens refuſed the
the Sum in groſs, the King did not
Talliate each man in particular.</p>
            <p>But I am told that <hi>this is nothing</hi> to
my <hi>purpoſe,</hi> 'tis ſtrange that he who
blames me in other places for not quot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
more than is <hi>for</hi> my <hi>purpoſe,</hi> when
nothing behind makes againſt me,
ſhould now tax me for not skipping
over any part of that Clauſe which
'twas needful to take and explain entire.</p>
            <p>To clear up his underſtanding if
poſſible, though I thought to have left
this Task, I will obviate an objection
which ſuch as our Anſwerer may make,
that 'tis <hi>obſcure</hi> how the Record of the
Common-Council of <hi>London</hi>'s concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
its ſelf about the Charge laid upon
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:54561:5"/>
the City ſhould explain that part of
the Charter which ſayes <hi>Simili modo
fiat de Civitate London,</hi> but ſurely pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
is a good Interpreter of a Law,
and there is this further evidence that
here is proviſion for the power of the
<hi>Common-Council</hi> of the City, becauſe
that holding <hi>in Capite,</hi> and being men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
diſtinct from all the other Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents
there named in general, it muſt
be for ſomething elſe, beſides that for
which 'tis joyned with the other Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Excedimus tenebris in crepuſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum,</hi>
from this <hi>obſcurity</hi> and <hi>darkneſs</hi>
to be felt by the Doctors <hi>groaping</hi> hand,
we come to broad day light.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>When in the</hi> 39th. H. 3. Proviſum
fuit per Conſilium Regis apud Merton,<note place="margin">Againſt <hi>Jani,</hi> p. 115. &amp; 117.</note>
               <hi>that he ſhould talliate his Demeaſns,
though this was after King</hi> John<hi>'s
Charter, which was</hi> intended to reſtrain
the King from levying publick Taxes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
publick conſent; <hi>yet</hi> it ſeems to
be plain by the Record that the King
by the advice of his Privy Council
taxed the City of <hi>London, even with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the conſent of the Common Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of his immediate Tenents, whom
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:54561:5"/>
he makes the Common-Council for all
manner of</hi> Aid <hi>and</hi> Eſcuage.</p>
            <p>But it may be ſaid, a Tallage was
no publick Tax, though the Tax here
ſpoke of, is made no more publick than
the conſent required to charge it;
Which conſent according to him, was
from immediate Tenents only, ſo that
<hi>Tallage</hi> might be a <hi>publick Tax</hi> as well
as any other. And to be ſure <hi>Scutagium</hi>
concerning the Kings Tenents only,
and the Caſes in which the King reſerv'd
to himſelf power of taxing without
publick conſent in his ſenſe, relating
only to them; the <hi>Tax</hi> becauſe of <hi>te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure</hi>
muſt be provided for, as well as
other, if any other were there meant
by <hi>Auxilium, vel Scutagium.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay, he owns expreſly, that <hi>accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Law in King</hi> John<hi>'s Charter,</hi>
London <hi>and other Cities and Burghs
were to be Aſſeſſed and Taxed by the
Common-Council of the Kingdom.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>p. 117.</hi> &amp; 118.</note>
And he makes a reaſon of that provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
to be the uſage in the time of
<hi>H. 2.</hi> for the King to <hi>Talliate,</hi> or Tax
them without ſuch a Council.</p>
            <p>The Doctor has doubtleſs the moſt
particular convincing way of reaſoning
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:54561:6"/>
of any man, he ſays <hi>that Law in King</hi>
John<hi>'s Charter intended to reſtrain the
King from levying of publick Taxes
without publick conſent:</hi> And <hi>the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of this Artice in King</hi> John<hi>'s Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is Argument ſufficient to prove it:
for,</hi> mark the weighty reaſon, <hi>H.</hi> the
Third after this was granted, and
<hi>Edw. 1ſt.</hi> taxed their Demeaſns through
<hi>England,</hi> though not the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
by Advice and Conſent of their
Privy-Councils only until the <hi>Stat' de
Tallagio non concedendo,</hi> That is (as
<hi>Tallage</hi> is confeſt to be, a <hi>Publick Tax)</hi>
becauſe ſome of King <hi>John</hi>'s Succeſſors
Tax't their Demeaſns without publick
conſent. Therefore 'twas provided in
King <hi>John</hi>'s time, by way of Propheſy,
that no publick Tax, Aid, or Eſcuage
ſhould be raiſed without publick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
            <p>So that what was done after, was a
moral cauſe, or occaſion of what pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded.</p>
            <p>'Twill be ſaid, that the thing that
the Doctor went to prove was, that the
Common-Council mentioned in the
Charter was the Great and Common-Council
of the Kingdom, to all intents
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:54561:6"/>
and purpoſes. Not that the King was
reſtrained from levying a publick Tax
without the conſent of the <hi>Great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.</hi>
But ſurely when he goes to give
the reaſon why the Charter muſt be
taken in ſuch a ſenſe, we are to expect
the proof of that, not of ſomething
elſe, quitting the thing to be proved.</p>
            <p>If I can underſtand his dark mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
he was proving that <hi>Nullum Scu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagium,
&amp;c.</hi> intended to reſtrain the
King from levying publick Taxes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
publick Conſent. That is (to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
what he very obſcurely drives at,)
the reſtraint was only from Taxing the
whole Kingdom; not from Taxing his
Tenants in <hi>Chief.</hi> And the reaſon of
this Article,<note place="margin">p. 118.</note> 
               <hi>viz.</hi> as taken in this ſenſe,
is, that ſeveral times after this Charter
was granted, <hi>Hen. 3.</hi> and <hi>Edw. 1.</hi> Taxed
their Demeaſns through <hi>England,</hi>
though not the whole Kingdom, by
Advice and Conſent of their Privy-Councils
only, until the Statute <hi>De
tallagio non concedendo</hi> was made 34 <hi>E.</hi>
1. And both <hi>Richard</hi> the Firſt and King
<hi>John</hi> had Taxed the whole Kingdom
without common Aſſent, before the
grant of <hi>Magna Charta.</hi> And when
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:54561:7"/>
he has made good the Premiſes in this
Argument for the meaning of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle,
which will be <hi>ad graecas Calendas,</hi>
then, he may conclude that this Article
intended to reſtrain the King,<note place="margin">Na. he ſhould have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>only.</hi>
               </note> only
from levying of publick Taxes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

about <hi>Eſcuage,</hi>

               </note> or <hi>Tallage,</hi> which none
but his immediate Tenants were liable
to. And from hence when prov'd, we
might with ſome more colour and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence
raiſe the Conſequence that the
Common-Council <hi>mentioned</hi> in King
<hi>John</hi>'s Charter was the Great and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Council
of the Kingdom to all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
and purpoſes. But how that
ſhould appear from the mention of <hi>Aid,</hi>
and <hi>Eſcuage</hi> only, will be a Queſtion.</p>

            <p>But what proof is there from the
word <hi>accepit,</hi> or the collecting of a
Tax, <hi>ex praecepto Regis,</hi> that he took
it without publick conſent?<note place="margin">

that every nine Knights ſhould find a

Though the Record ſhews, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides

King <hi>John</hi> before the paſſing of his

theſe Members whoſe right is here

perſons; for they could not have been
ſummoned to come by Repreſentation
in the caſe of ſuch particular Writs, or

ſetled before the Summons, which is
not to be ſuppoſed. Theſe Arguments
all but the laſt, which the Doctor has

            </p>
            <p>(9.) Since <hi>William</hi> the Firſt was no

Folcmote,</hi> or <hi>General Council</hi> in the <hi>Saxon</hi>
times, where to be ſure all Proprietors
of Land were to be <hi>Members,</hi> could not
have been turn'd into an Aſſembly of
the Kings Tenents upon the old legal
Title, (and without a Conqueſt there
was no other.)</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:54561:16"/>
And as there muſt have been a vaſt

of thoſe <hi>Councils</hi> which laid any

came in Perſon, had.</p>
            <p>(10.) Though demonſtration it ſelf
will not ſatisfie unreaſonable men, yet
not to mention more I ſhall urge the
Authority of the Legier Book of <hi>Ely</hi>
before cited,<note place="margin">Jani, p. 41.</note> (the great Antiquity of

            </p>
            <p>(1.) If he himſelf yields that till
King <hi>John</hi>'s Charter there was no ſuch
Council as one made up only of Tenents
<hi>in Capite,</hi> he thereby renders all under
this head <hi>precarious,</hi> but this he does in
two places at leaſt. One where he
urges that if the <hi>Curia Regis Ordinaria,</hi>
which I ſay was the Court of the Kings
Tenents,<note place="margin">Againſt <hi>Jani, p. 46.</hi> &amp; 47.</note> and Officers excluſive of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<hi>went off by reaſon of the Clauſe</hi> in
King <hi>John</hi>'s Charter, <hi>it certainly went
off before it began,</hi> that is, ſuch a Court
began not before; and agreeable to this,
he ſays, that <hi>after the granting of this
Charter by King</hi> John <hi>there were many
General, and Great Councils, or</hi> Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiums
<hi>ſummon'd by Edict according to
the form there preſcribed:</hi> that is, as
he will have it, after that the Tenents
<hi>in Capite</hi> only were ſummon'd to the
<hi>Great Council,</hi> but not before, for then
<hi>began</hi> this <hi>form.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>In another place (though he charges
upon me what are his own words) he
ſays</hi> King <hi>John</hi> reſigned his Crown the 15.<note place="margin">ib. p. 22. <hi>&amp; 23.</hi>
               </note>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:54561:19"/>
of <hi>May</hi> in the 14th. of his Reign, and
he granted the great Charter of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
three years after on the 15. of
<hi>June</hi> in the 17. of his Reign,<note place="margin">Thus <hi>p. 48. &amp; 49.</hi> he charges Mr. <hi>Petyt</hi> and me for averring that even Servants who are not in a legal ſenſe people of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom were Members of the Great Council.</note> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
could not reſign it in ſuch a Council
as was Conſtituted three years after his
Reſignation. <hi>And 'tis a queſtion whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he aſſerts not this in a third place,
where he affirms that before this Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
the Kingdom had been Taxt by our
ancient Kings, and their Privy-Council
only.</p>
            <p>(2.) But in truth he not only yields
that the Tenents in <hi>Chief</hi> were firſt
made the <hi>General Council</hi> by King <hi>John</hi>'s
Charter;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>My words are</hi> in ſuch a Council as this here.</note> but that after that, more than
ſuch were Members,<note place="margin">Jani, p. 15. which is as much as to ſay that there was <hi>ſuch a Council as this</hi> before. p. 118.</note> not only the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents
in <hi>Military Service,</hi> of Tenents
in Chief, but other <hi>ordinary Freehol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi>
So that he ſubmits himſelf to be
goard by both the horns of that <hi>Dilem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi>
inforc't in my former Treatiſe, <hi>viz.</hi>
that King <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Charter was either de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarative
of the Law as 'twas before,</hi>

introductive of a new Law.</hi> And yields
the <hi>precariouſneſs</hi> of his own <hi>vagaries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(3.) But does he not own that the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:54561:20"/>
Notion that Tenents <hi>in Capite</hi> only
were <hi>Noble,</hi> is <hi>precarious?</hi> Since he
yields that no kind of tenure does no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitate,
<note place="margin">Gloſ. p. 10.</note> or ſo much as make a man
free who was not ſo before <hi>according to
his Blood or Extraction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though, according to this, one
that held of the King in Chief might
have been a Subjects Villain, yet none
that held a certain Eſtate of <hi>Freehold</hi>
could be a Villain, becauſe 'tis contrary
to the nature of a <hi>Freehold,</hi> that it
ſhould be ſo no longer than another
pleas'd, that is only an Eſtate at will.</p>
            <p>He will have it that Mr. <hi>Petyt</hi> is
guilty of ſome horrible <hi>Deſign,</hi>

the worſt <hi>deſign,</hi> the World will judge;
and I doubt not, but he has at home a

            <p>As on Mr. <hi>Petyts,</hi> and my ſide, the
<hi>deſign</hi> can be no other, than to ſhew
how deeply rooted the Parliamentary

though indeed at that time there was

ſuch a nomination, yet that was not
to any Parliament, or to make any new
Law, or lay any kind of Charge upon

was a Summons of a Council to adviſe

the Statute of the Staple made the 21 of

from the <hi>Generalia Concilia,</hi> or

the power and ſubtilty of our learned

the Aſſembly they are Summon'd to,

ſuch meer <hi>Ordinances</hi> (the diſtinction
of which from Acts is well known)
that that very next Parliament finds it
needful to confirm, and give them the
force of a Law. Agreeably to this the
Earl Marſhal in that grand Caſe in the

theſe are uncontrollable evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences,
and proofs againſt him, let him

anſwer them if he can.</p>
            <p>But who is the <hi>new Government-Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,

muſt be meant of ſuch <hi>its Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</hi>

Parliament,<note place="margin">ib. p. 227. <hi>&amp;</hi> 228.</note> or paſt by, at the Kings

            <p>And this <hi>deſign</hi> will be very <hi>evident</hi>
if we obſerve his <hi>aery ambuſcade,</hi> to

return his own phraſe, and meer juggle
in joyning <hi>the Kings Authority and
time</hi> together; we think we have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but by an Hocus Pocus Trick
'tis gone; for admit that <hi>its Perfection</hi>
were ſuch as we ſay it has at this day,
<hi>viz.</hi> for Lords to come of Right in
their own Perſons, and that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
ſhould ſend Repreſentatives of
their free Choice. Yet let us ſee what
ſetlement he gives this <hi>Great Council,</hi>
for which purpoſe we muſt divide the
two Authorities, which ſometimes may
differ.</p>
            <p>And (1.) Suppoſe that though time
would preſerve that power which the
<hi>Great Council</hi> exerciſes, a King would
hereafter take it all to himſelf, and
make Laws by a Council of his own
chuſing, or without any. If the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
allows this power, doubtleſs the
next Parliament will thank him.</p>
            <p>(2.) Suppoſe that without, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Kings Authority, <hi>time</hi> only
would eſtabliſh this Great Council, can
this be done? He that affirms it ſurely
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:54561:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
will be no great friend to Prerogative,
nor underſtands he that Maxim,</p>
            <q>Nullum tempus occurrit Regi.</q>
            <p>And one of theſe muſt be clos'd with.</p>
            <p>'Twill be objected that I am as inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
to Prerogative in arguing that
ſome Lords may have a Right of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
to come to the Upper-Houſe.</p>
            <p>But I think no ſober man will deny
that there is a right either from Writs
alone, or from Writs as preſcribed to,
and 'tis ſtrange that it ſhould not be
againſt Prerogative to urge a right from
one Royal Conceſſion, and yet it ſhould
be to urge it from many; but farther,
if they who had no right to come in
Perſon, or be Repreſented in Parliament,
ſhould by colour of Preſcription put
themſelves upon the King for Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors,
this were derogatory to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative.
But if there be a natural right
for <hi>Proprietors</hi> of Land (with whom
ſome ſay is the ballance of power with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
this Nation) to be intereſted in the
Legiſlature, which I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap> not affirm.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:54561:24"/>
Or if there be ſuch a poſitive right, not
only from the Laws for frequent Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
which ſuppoſe ſuch to be <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi>
as had been, but more particularly
from the Law received in the <hi>4th.</hi> of
<hi>William</hi> the Firſt,<note place="margin">Rex debet omnia rite facere in Regno &amp; per judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerum Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gni.</note> and by poſitive Law
or Cuſtom the King us'd to ſend ſpecial
Writs for ſome, general for others;
the Preſcribing to ſpecial Writs, which
is not of Subſtance as to the Legiſlative
Intereſt, is no diminution of Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive;
becauſe no more in effect is out
of the King than was before, which is,
that this man ſhould one way or other
have a ſhare in the Legiſlature.</p>
            <p>If this Solution of mine will not paſs
I cannot help it, I am ſure the Law for
a right grounded upon one or more Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
