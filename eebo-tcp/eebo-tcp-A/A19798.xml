            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

since I haue séene sundry so doubtfull and vncerten in this behalfe, that they haue twise chaunged their opinion in one day, and in the afternoone haue bin of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry iudgement to that, which themselues thought true in the morning. And I haue séene some so ernest in denying it, and so hard of beléef for want of knowledge, that neither sufficient witnesses, neyther constant confessing of their owne crime, and acknowledging and detesting of the same by those that haue bin conuicted thereof, could bring them from their erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious minde, and in fine induce them to beleue that there are sorcerous witches. Wherefore I thinke it very necessary to determine what is to be folowed therein.</p>

with the same Satan, by casting certen lottes, such as in the olde tyme were huc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle bones or dyce, and now a dayes by an hearen bagge, which will turne rounde at the mumbling of certen superstitious woordes. The Frenchmen folowing the accustomable proprietie of theyr toongue, and by clipping shorter the word, out of the latine <hi>Sortilegus,</hi> haue made it <hi>Sorcier.</hi> The <hi>Hebrues</hi> in this deduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of woordes haue no affinitie nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gréement eyther with the Gretians or Latines, or with vs Frenchmen: For those whom wée tearme <hi>Sortiarij,</hi> Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerers, those they call <hi>Chobarim,</hi> for that they put their mischéeuous practises in vre, through sinister and secret craft. And it is not to bee doubted, but that the woorde <hi>Sortiarius</hi> is deryued of the more auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t word <hi>Sortilegus.</hi> Which by what meanes it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to passe, I will now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare. First it is euident, that among the manifolde causes wherupon men ioyne &amp; binde themselues to the diuel, this hath bin the chiefest and most auncient, namely (such béeing the vanitie &amp; curiositie of vs al, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of nature,) to knew things to come,
<pb facs="tcp:9717:12"/>
and to foretel them also to other. For there is none of vs contented with his owne e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, but we striue al to reach vnto the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries of God, supposing our selues to haue attayned to the top of the most high prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stination, if we get any vnderstanding in thinges to come, which are hid from other. This foolish vanitie when Satan percey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in al ages to reigne in the harts of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and that they much desired to foreknowe what was to come, he omitted no diligence in taking this occasion, therby to curry fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to win their hartes, to make them beholding vnto him. Thus made hee promise vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that he would perfourme that which they required, &amp; that he would giue them vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding of things to come, if they would obey and harken vnto him: which these vaine, mad, and curious men refused not to doe. So that in conclusion, there was made a most firme league and couenaunt betwéene Satan &amp; these grée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die desirers to know thinges to come, that he would tell them what should ensue, and they should hereafter continue in bondage &amp; slauery vnto him. Thus first of al sprang vp these deuiners &amp; sorcerers, which were
<pb facs="tcp:9717:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the first men of all that had any dealinges or frindship with the Diuel, wherby after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward it came to passe, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whosoeuer were seruisable or addicted to Satan, were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the name which is wel knowne and commune, that is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sorcerers.

                  <p>The word Sorcerer, was first found and inuented since the byrth of Christ, but the thing it self, and those kynd of witches, were knowne long before the birth of Christ.

So that in these dayes, wherein is séene a
<pb facs="tcp:9717:25"/>
most gréeuous &amp; pitiefull rebellion of men against Gods true doctrine, Satan hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> power fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God to allure the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto him, and to sifte them, and there is geuen vnto him the very effect and force of errour to deceiue, intrappe, and leade away many, as the spirite of God hath long since wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessed it should bée, in the seconde to the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> the second Chapter &amp; tenth verse, and that God would geue him the power and gift to deceyue, that men should geue credence to Satan, and to lyes, and such should bée damned as beléeued not the trueth, but haue yéelded to vnrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, bicause they haue not embraced the loue of the trueth that they might be saued.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:9717:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
then those which supposed that the madde men and possessed with diuels, which liued in the time of our Lord and sauiour Iesus Christ, and were by him healed, were none other then men sick and troubled with me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholick, &amp; chollerick diseases: whose opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is altogither blasphemous, for thei take away y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> certentie of the christian faith, and deny the deuine nature of our Lord Iesus Christ, repugning &amp; lying against y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> trueth of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thing: for how could y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diuels haue spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in their bodies, or w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> so great force haue gone out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> possessed persons, &amp; haue torne y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> members &amp; partes of their bodies, if these thinges were but mere dreemes of troubled minds, &amp; fansies, &amp; only fits of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cholick diseases? So are sorcerers plainly miserable slaues vnto Satan, &amp; in subiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vnto him, him doe they worship, to him doo they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit themselues, yea &amp; offer vnto him ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dles of waxe in token of honour. Yet some of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doo séeme far more abiecte &amp; fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily seruisable. For when Satan sheweth himself vnto them in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> likenes of a man, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which is to shamful to speak, they kisse his buttocks, which thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g certe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> afterward haue fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ckli co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fessed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues to haue don.
<pb facs="tcp:9717:26"/>
And therefore it hapneth vnto them, that they be deliuerd ouer into so reprobate sense of mynde, that God punisheth them most iustly, who, as I haue declared, doe most obstinately and vnthankfully, eyther despise Christes gospel which is offred vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, or when they haue receiued it, and vnderstood it, they taste thereof very cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and lightly. In which twoo poyntes the most greatest, and gréeuous contempt of God is perceiued. Howbeit, frende <hi>Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> mée thinketh I may truely say this much, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> like as our Lord God purposed to ennoble and celebrate the first comming of his only begotten sonne Iesus Christ, and minding to make the same famous and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowmed throughout all the world, would haue that there should be at that present many possessed with Diuels, limatick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, blinde, dumbe, &amp; deafe, whom Christ should restore to health, and whom the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did in such wise prepare for the sunne therehence, for him to reape glorie: so in this our age, wherein by his great and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible benefites towardes man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, as a special gift, he hath restored vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs the light of his holy gospell, of very
<pb facs="tcp:9717:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
iustice he will haue it, that moe despisers of this reuealed light, rather at this day, then before, fall into the snares of Satan, and become Sorcerers, that is to say, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted vnto Satan, and that they which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise God may be the more terrefied by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of these wretches: and the Godly which with true faith embrace the gospel, may more earnestly praise god, and in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of so great a benefit bestowed vpon them, yéeld vnto god the greater than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, iudging their owne state to be blessed, since by the singular benefit of God, they are deliuered from so great a mischéefe, and so great power of the Diuel. Doe you now vnderstand, frende <hi>Anthony,</hi> why there be now a dayes moe witches, and Sorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, then were heretofore?</p>

                  <speaker>Anthony.</speaker>
                  <p>Yea verely <hi>Theophilus,</hi> and I geue you thankes for telling it vnto me. But now to thintent I may be throughly confirmed in your opinion, adde hereunto your third argument, which as you sayd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> consisteth in the reason of vpright iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Theophil.</speaker>
                  <p>You put me well in mynde thereof, for I had almost let that passe: But
<pb facs="tcp:9717:27"/>
now I will take it in hand. Reason of vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right and sincere iudgement, willeth vs to beleue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there be Sorcerers. The same is this, wheresoeuer is the true and efficient cause of any thing, there is it necessary also that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> effect doe follow. For example sake, wheresoeuer the Sunne is, there is both light &amp; day, bicause the Sunne is true and efficient cause of both. Wheresoeuer the Northerne winde bloweth, there it is cold, bicause y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> winde is ingenderer of coldnesse. And to apply this generall assumption to our present argument: thus doe the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers teach vs, which are conuersant in searching &amp; declaring y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> causes of thinges: such causes as are endued w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> soule &amp; will, if wil &amp; power doo there meete togither to doo any thing, necessarily and immediately theron ensueth the effect. For example. If a man be hungrie, and haue bread lying by him, he will eate: if he be a thirst, and haue drinke nere, he wil drinke: if he be a colde, and he be brought to a fyre, he will warme himself. For by this meanes he hath both a will and abilitie: wherefore we must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarely conclude y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he will doe it. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse Satan is the cause of these witches,
<pb facs="tcp:9717:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and intoxicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. He hath both a desire and abilitie ioinct to doo that mischief, to drawe men vnto him, and to lincke them vnto him, (this power being geuen vnto him by the iust iudgement of God ouer rebellious men) wherefore it is not to be doubted, but that he would win &amp; enforce them to that kinde of wickednes. On which point, that I may the more largely discourse, this much I think you will graunt me, <hi>Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there haue alwayes bin vnbeleuing men in the world, that is to wit, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God out of his word, or not regarding him when they knew him.</p>

                  <p>Neither will you also deny this, that Satan since the time he renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced his first originall, and was made a Diuell, alwayes applyed this, and as much as in him lay, indeuored to plucke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way men from knowledge of the true god, &amp; fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their assured hope of saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, finally, to make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne &amp; refuse y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> promises of god, persuading the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to yéeld &amp; geue ouer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>selues vnto him, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he sawe to be cold in the worshipping of god, &amp; necligent in em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing

                  <speaker>Anthony.</speaker>
                  <p>You say trueth, for Satan is like a roaring Lyon, who alwayes run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth about seking whom he may deuoure, and pul from God, as sayeth S. <hi>Peter.</hi> The first of <hi>Peter,</hi> the v. chapter, and viii. verse.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Theophil.</speaker>
                  <p>You well remember the place, <hi>Anthony,</hi> and the same is the cause why he is also in the <hi>Reuelation</hi> called the olde Serpent, in the xx. chapter, and second verse, which is to say, the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon &amp; sworne enemy of mankinde, as our sauiour Christ sayeth, in the xiii. chapter of <hi>Mathew,</hi> the xxviii. verse, working and bringing to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, chiefly in the children of vnbeleefe, whatsoeuer he will or lifteth, as sayth S. <hi>Paule,</hi> the second chapter to the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> the ii. verse. For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wrath of God commeth vpon stubburne men. Now therefore, since by all these places it is euident that Satan hath a will and desire to drawe men away from the feare and faith of God: it remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth now that we see whether he haue po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer also to pull them away.</p>

                  <p>Then shall your whole rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son be concluded and ended. But I pray you, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> hath Satan so great po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
<pb facs="tcp:9717:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ouer men that he can plucke them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God, and pull them to himselfe, being the creatures of God, made according to his Image, and specially seruing vnto his onely glory?</p>

                  <p>Truely <hi>Anthony,</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, that Satan coulde neuer haue had that power, vnlesse it were geuen vnto him by almighty God, which by this most iust meanes doth punish them, which most vnthankefully and wickedly dooe forsake him. Howbeit, we are not able to shew the reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> why God deliuereth this man more then that man vnto Satan, and wyll haue him be myslead, more then to say that this is the iust wyl of God, which hath so deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined: Notwithstanding, there was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer yet any Sorcerer, but he was lead a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse through his owne fault, and vnlesse wittingly and willingly he had renounced God his creatour, and maker, the aucthour of his lyfe, and geuer of all good thinges whom he forsaketh, and most impudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and most trayterously refuseth to take him for his God, if he betake himselfe to Satan, and become a Sorcerer.</p>

                  <p>Is this credible which you

                  <p>This is to true, for so doo they al of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whosoeuer become sorcerers.

                  <p>I wyll doo so. And first it is most certen they haue power ouer men, for that we dayly behold, whilst some they kyll with their poysons, &amp; some they make sicke and past recouery. I haue séene them, who with onely laying their handes vpon a nurses breastes, haue drawne foorth all the milke, and dryed them vp. I haue séene, that haue caused vnto some most greuous paine of the Cholick, wringinges in the belly, the Goute, the Palsie, the Apoplexie, that haue also made men lame and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and caste them into other diseases, whiche neither themselues afterwarde, neither yet most excellent learned Phisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions could knowe, or cure. And these sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerers dooe cruelly rage vpon all men, of all genders, ages, &amp; orders, without choice or exception. What shall I saye more?
<pb facs="tcp:9717:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>
The seruantes and plouwmen if they bée angrie, will intoxicate their maisters. And as for beastes and cattell, they poyson them to death sundrie wayes: and if they be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, they will not kill them forthwith, but make them swell, or make them leane and pine away, in such wise that there is nothing worse or more hurtfull then their wickednesse. Moreouer, they will enchaunt wilde beastes, and make them stand still that you may take them in your hand, as it is written in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lviii. psalme, the v. verse: as the Serpentes, and Aspes. Although S. <hi>Augustine</hi> in the xi. booke of <hi>Gene.</hi> vpon the letter, the xxviii. chapter, writeth that it may be done by Satan most easily vpon a Serpent or Snake, bicause that by his conference and familiaritie with the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, at the beginning mankinde was se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, as if this were the serpentes punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in recompence of his seruice, to bée more subiect and bounde at the call &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of Satan: Howbeit, experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence it self teacheth, that that which is done in him, may likewise be done by sorcerers in all other liuing thinges. For the holy scripture in the third of <hi>Genesis</hi> doeth not
<pb facs="tcp:9717:33"/>
set downe vnto vs, that the serpent is more addicted or subiect to Satan, then the other beastes. In fine, all this reason and dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> in my iudgement, is ouer subtile. And as for Herbes, Trées, with their berries and fruites, and all such like thinges, truely they may be by them intoxicated, which that notable saying of <hi>Virgil,</hi> procéeding from dayly experience, sheweth in the viii. <hi>Ecloge.</hi>

Imagine that you had killed mée, and suppose it in your mynde as earnestly as you can, shall my good health therefore be altered, or in any poynt diminished? Surely not at all. For no mans false or vaine imagination is able to infect, or bring diseases vpon any other mans body. But we féele how sorcerers ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually bring diseases, we sée also howe they haue caused plagues, &amp; those most grée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous, with other such like effectes, which cannot be denyed.

                  <p>Yea, I haue both. And as for examples, they are almost infinite, dayly hapning, and conuersant before our eyes.

Moreouer y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which <hi>Virgil,</hi> prince of Poetes, and best learned of all the learned of his time, in the eight <hi>Ecloge</hi> prooueth the same. For this is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb facs="tcp:9717:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>
from dayly experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce which he sayth:
<q>
                        <l>Knit collers three, &amp; in three knots them,</l>
                        <l>Amaryllis fitte.</l>

The same also is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed by the <hi>Canon, Si. Per.</hi> which is the last .xxxiij.j. question in the Decrée.

                  <p>Yea truly <hi>Anthony,</hi> reade y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 17. &amp; 18. Chapter of his worke <hi>De Ciuitate dei,</hi> where S. <hi>Augustine</hi> reporteth, that many both heathen men and Christians haue sayd, that they were so transfourmed, specially one <hi>Daniaenetus,</hi> and <hi>Praestans,</hi> with many other moe.</p>

                  <p>Surely that can not bée, that an euyl spirite or Diuell can chaunge our nature or being, as they call it. For this is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> only propertie and power of God, that as he hath created the natures of thinges, so is he able to chaunge them: which Satan cannot doe by any meanes, neither by himself, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by his seruantes the Sorcerers.</p>

                  <p>You say trueth, and so sainct <hi>Augustine</hi> also writeth in another place. Howbeit they that say they were so trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourmed, they doo but suppose that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time they liued so, yet they are deceiued, and those be none other then false fansies and imaginations, which by meanes of some stronge illusion, or great sicknesse, are imprinted in their myndes. But I doo not likewise deny, but that Satan brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
<pb facs="tcp:9717:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>
some into that persuasion, which that hée may bring to passe, hée bringeth a sléepe and blyndeth their outward senses, then bringeth hée into their imagination sundry fourmes of thinges, which he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printeth so effectually within their trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled myndes and humoures, that they thinke themselues in déed to be at that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent &amp; to haue bin such things. So likewise, phisitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s teach vs y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there are certe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> diseases of the bodie, wherein a man shall séeme to himself to be a Woulfe, an Hogge, an Oxe, a Mule, likewise that they bée all made of glasse, or of Waxe, &amp; such other like thing. I haue also séene one that would affirme and sweare, that hée was a Cocke: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the true and vndoubted cause of such illusions, and deceiptions of minde, which may be done by Sorcerers arte, dependeth vpon this, that the humours and tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the bodie being distempered, the parties themselues séeme after a sort to be chaunged, and alienated from themselues, by working of the Diuell, that they shall not know any other thinges that are repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented vnto them: So that those that be so vexed, doe easily persuade themselues that
<pb facs="tcp:9717:38"/>
they are such as they reporte, which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witstanding are but mere illusions of the Diuell.</p>

                  <p>But <hi>Nabucadnezar</hi> King of <hi>Assyrians,</hi> was transfourmed into a brute beast, and eate grasse the space of seuen yeares, as it is read in <hi>Daniel,</hi> the fourth chapter.</p>

                  <speaker>Theophil.</speaker>
                  <p>So it is. But that is thus to be vnderstoode of <hi>Nabucadnezer,</hi> that we must not thinke that his humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was conuerted into the essencie or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a brute beast. But his conuersation was chaunged, and his mynde and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which was wont to be desirous of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s company. Moreouer that we must graunt that all this befell vnto him by the power of almightie God our creatour, and not by Satans meanes (by which onely Sorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers doe worke) to haue béene brought to passe: For God is able to take away or change the esse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cies or natures of thinges, but Satan is not able. Wherefore those things which are reported, how some men are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerted into wolues, are to be iudged most false. Howbeit there be some y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme such thinges to be doone among the

                  <p>Hitherto you haue sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly declared ouer what kynd of thinges sorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers haue power.

                  <p>The solution of this your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde is easy, fréende <hi>Anthony.</hi> First, God that is most iust, by that meanes doth punish the sinnes of his childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For those whom we terme godly &amp; true Christians, they are many tymes not onely not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their infirmities and imperfections, but subiect also vnto gréeuous sinnes and offences, as Sainct <hi>Iohn</hi> teacheth in the
<pb facs="tcp:9717:39"/>
first Epistle, the first Chapter, the ix. and x. verse. <hi>If wee say that wee haue no sinne, wee make God a lyar.</hi> Wherefore these are iustly by God punished, besides that by this kinde of crosse and affliction, God tryeth the patience of his chosen: For lyke as hée prooued his seruaunt <hi>Iob</hi> by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuries of the most vngodly men the <hi>Caldes</hi>: so doth hee also prooue his beloued people by the witchcraft and poysoning of Sorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, which redoundeth vnto the profit and commoditie of the faithfull. For as Sainct <hi>Paule</hi> sayth to the <hi>Romans</hi> the fift Chapter, and third verse. <hi>Affliction bringeth pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, patience bringeth probation, proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion bringeth hope, which neuer confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, for the loue of God is sowen in our hartes through the holy Ghost.</hi> So that the godly ought patiently to abide these afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, so to submit themselues to God, and confirme themselues wholy vnto his will and pleasure.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:9717:40"/>
or any of these sorcerers, nor neuer minde to be: neither looke I for any prayse, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knowledge of these matters. Howbeit so farre as myne abilitie shall extend, I wyll satisfie your honest request. This therfore is that which you require of me, by what meanes Sorcerers doe worke, and infect thinges with their poyson: wherein I will answere that which is most true, that they doe all these thinges by meanes, instinct, and craft of the most miserable &amp; wicked Satan the Diuell. For this much I dare affirme vnto you, that there is no sorcerer but he maketh a league &amp; couenant with the Diuel, and voweth himselfe vnto him. In confirmation of which vowing, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaueth in his body some note or marke made and imprinted by Satan in some parte, which he alwayes beareth aboute him, some vnder theyr eye liddes, others betwene their buttockes, some in the roofe of their mouth, and in other places where it may be hid &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cealed from vs. Although some be of opinion, that all Sorcerers are not priuily pricked and marked by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, but those onely of whose constancie towardes him hée standeth in doubt, and

                  <speaker>Anthony.</speaker>
                  <p>Yea, but forasmuch as Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan of his owne nature is a great lyer, yea the father of lyes, will hée kéepe touch and
<pb facs="tcp:9717:41"/>

                  <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
                  <p>Satan is not alwayes a lyer, though he be alwayes a deceyuer. For of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes he speaketh truth, that he may deceyue those that heare him: and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he perfourmeth his promise, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he will not seeme to be a deceyuer, but rather a teller of truthe. When Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan sayd of our Sauiour Christ, in Marke the .ij. Chapter, the .xxiiij. verse. <hi>Thou arte that holy one of God:</hi> He sayd true, and lyed not. But what was his mynde then? Forsoothe that they whiche hearde that, should afterwarde be deceyued. And when he sayd as much of Paul and Sillas in the .xvj. chapter of Actes, the .xvij. verse, in these wordes, <hi>These men are the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantes of the great God, whiche shewe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you the way of saluation</hi>: he sayd true, yet notwithstanding he was a deceyuer, and by that meanes he sought a way to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue men.

                  <p>This is almost the maner of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their couenant. First Sata<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> requireth of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that they do wholly &amp; fully renounce the true God, creator of al thinges, the lord of heauen &amp; hell, &amp; that henceforward they serue him, who there professeth him selfe without dissimulation to be Satan, and that hereafter they depend at his becke and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, séeking al their helpe of him. Which renouncing &amp; denying of the true God, with the most abhominable forswe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of him, is the first step &amp; entrance to make frendship &amp; agréeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t betwene these wicked men &amp; Satan, and the first bargain of all this busines. Unto these in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable maner being receiued into seruice &amp; slauery to Sata<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he then geueth a marke either w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his téeth or hand, &amp; then willeth euery one to demaunde of him what they would haue him do for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, teaching them the safest &amp; priuiest wayes to reuenge the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues vpon those who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they hate. Then ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth he pouders, rootes, &amp; poysons vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ether by himself or by others y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are there in a redines, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they may fréely &amp; safely intoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they list. Then this vngracious &amp; new serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of satan, euery day afterward
<pb facs="tcp:9717:42"/>
something of his goods to his patrone, some his dogge, some his hen, and some his cat. In which dooing, there is a greater ratify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their déede, and deniall of the true God, then in their first contract. And to conclude, this is the summe of al their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse. But Satan distrusting the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancie of his seruauntes, shortly after cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth them togither into a Diuelish Sina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goge, and that he may also vnderstand of them howe well and diligently they haue fulfilled their office of intoxicating com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted vnto them, &amp; who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they haue slaine: wherefore they méete togither in certen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed places, not al of them togither, nor at once, but certen of them whom he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth to call, so that he apointeth where they shall méete, and at what houre of the day, or of the night: wherein they haue no sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, nor certentie. For these méetinges are not weekely, nor monthly, nor yéerely, but when and how often it shall séeme good to this their maister. And many times him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self warneth them to méete, sometimes hée apoynteth others to warne them in his stéede. But when he doth it himself, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth vnto them in likenesse of a man, or
<pb facs="tcp:9717:42" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in some other fourme whereby they may know him, in so much that it hapneth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tymes, that among a great company of men, the Sorcerer only knoweth Satan, that is present, when other doo not know him, although they see another man, but who or what he is, they know not. But when he citeth them to appeare by any of his other disciples and Sorcerers, vnto which appearance both tyme and place is apointed, in which they must resort to their miserable méetinges, and impious Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goges, which they call Satanicall Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bathes: then doo they méete. And if any chance to pretend, that the iourny is long, or themselues weake and féeble, and that they stand in feare and dread of men, hee answeareth them sufficiently to all their excusations. For he promiseth that himself wil conuay them thither, that are so weak that they cannot trauaile of themselues: which many tymes he doth by meanes of a staffe or rod, which he deliuereth vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or promiseth to doo it by force of a certen oyntment which he will geue them: and sometimes he offreth them an horse to ride vpon. But if they be yet affraid, he sheweth
<pb facs="tcp:9717:43"/>
them a meanes how they shall goe and not be seene during all the time of the iorney, and come safely thither. In the ende he cutteth away all pretences and excuses of absence, and he sheweth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> these meanes, bicause he woulde seeme to be more lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and carefull ouer them, thereby to make them more bounde and beholding vnto him. Thus whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they méete together he appeareth visibly vnto them in sundrie fourmes, as the head &amp; chiefe of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation. Sometime he talketh with them in shape of a man, sometime like a most filthy bucke goate, and sometime in other licknesses. Then doe they all repeate the othe which they haue geuen vnto him, in acknowledging him to be their God, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fal they to dauncing, wherin he leadeth the daunce, or els they hoppe and daunce me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely about him, singing most filthy songes made in his prayse. Whiche beeing all fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, then he demaundeth agayne of them what they woulde require of him, and what poysons they lacke to intoxicate any man. And as any of them vttereth the cankred request of their poysoned stomack against any man: so doth he shew
<pb facs="tcp:9717:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>
them a meanes to reuenge. For vnto some he geueth poysons ready made, and others he teacheth howe to make and mingle new. Unto others he geueth certay<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens, and charecters, and wordes, or oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by vertue whereof he promiseth them they shall foreknowe moste surely thinges to come, and bring to effect what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer they would worke. Finally, if in any thing they néede his presence and helpe, by couenant he promiseth to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent with them. So that the meanes whereby Sorcerers doe intoxicate, are partly manifest and starke poisons, whose ingredience, as they terme them, are dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and mortiferous, and condemned by the learned Phisitions, for thinges that kil presently: partly they are without poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, that we or the Sorcerers themselues can vnderstande of, howbeit they mingle some with them: partly also they put no visible poyson to hurte into them, which is much more maruelous tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other twayne aboue specified. Wherfore, if they haue mingled any of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> manifest &amp; known poisons, they are sone perceiued of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Phisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and are found to be suche, after that
<pb facs="tcp:9717:44"/>
they vnderstand by their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fession of what stuffe they consist, and are made. And those which they geue, not themselues knowing what they bee, or of what thinges they bee compounded, notwithstanding they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neue in hurting. Lyke as although they seeme not to haue myngled any hurtfull poyson, yet cease they not to intoxicate, doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it either only with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ayre or breath of their mouth, or else holding a certen roote within their téeth which Satan deliuereth vnto them, which they chawe, &amp; so doo kill and destroy men with only talking with them. And whereas many tymes they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxicate them whom they touch not, it may not séeme straunge vnto vs: For then the intoxication is done by Satan himself, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uily casting forth or blowing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> powder or roote vpon them, at the Sorcerers request: which Satan doth according to couenant, as I haue sayd, by reason wherof in certen thinges he is their seruant, and supplyeth vnto them his wicked and cruell atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunce.</p>

                  <speaker>Anthony.</speaker>
                  <p>First I agrée with you in this, that Satan can appeare vnto men in the shape of a man, which if we should say can not be done: then must we denie the méeting and talking togither of Christe with the Diuell, whereof the Scripture maketh mention in the .iiii. of <hi>Mathew,</hi> where it is written, how Satan appeared visibly, and in the shape of a man, vnto Christ. Secondly, I wil easely graunt you
<pb facs="tcp:9717:45"/>
that Sorcerers can learne no good thing of Satan, but suche counsels and precepts as proceede from a vile and naughtie dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, suche as is, to reuenge himselfe, to intoxicate straungers, to slay men at vnwares, and to minister all these thinges priuelie, none knowing or wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of it. Some also there bée that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge them selues, eyther suche as hate their brothers, beeing the children of the Diuell, as sayth Sainct Iohn, the first of Iohn, the thirde chapter, and tenth verse, as we are on the other side commaunded all by the expresse commaundement of God, to loue all men. Mathew the .v. chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter .xliiij. verse. Wherfore I suppose these two poyntes to be true.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Theophilus,</speaker>
                  <p>Wherin then doe you disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grée from me, <hi>Anthony</hi>?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Antho.</speaker>
                  <p>Forsooth in these thrée thinges. First in this, that the Sorcerers say, and you likewise folowing the truthe of their confession doe affirme the same, that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely and corporally they bée present in those assemblies which are called by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan. Secondly, where you say that they bee caried by Satan vnto those places.
<pb facs="tcp:9717:45" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Thirdly, in that whiche you sayde laste, that they can intoxicate men without any mingling of poyson. For I can not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade my selfe that any thing can possibly be by méere voyces, wordes, figures, or charecters, hurte, holpen, poysoned, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxicated.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Theophilus.</speaker>
                  <p>I will answere you order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to these thrée poyntes. And as touching the first: Doe you not thinke, <hi>Anthony,</hi> that Sorcerers doe méete togither, and be present in those their diuelishe conuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles and Synagogues, notwithstanding that they vaunt themselues thereof? How I pray you then doe you thinke it is?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Anthony.</speaker>
                  <p>Onely in cogitation of mind, and illusion of the Diuell, like as in our sléepe we thinke that we haue seene many thinges, and to haue beene in suche places where we neuer were: and many times that we haue talken with those that are very farre of from vs, yea perhaps more than two hundred miles. The like whereof happeneth to Sorcerers through crafte of the Diuel, who sundry times also deludeth vs in other matters, in so muche that oftentimes we thinke that we see,
<pb facs="tcp:9717:46"/>
touche, and feele thinges, whiche in deede we neither see, nor feele. And that you shal not thinke that I am of this opinion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out sufficient reason, I haue many excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent learned and auncient men, of myne opinion. Throughout all the discourse of this question, you haue often commended Sainct <hi>Augustine.</hi> But he in place where he intreateth of the chaunged shapes of men, as in the .xviii. booke <hi>de Ciuitate Dei,</hi> teacheth, howe thinges that are beléeued and supposed doo so come to passe in déede, for as much as therein that power of the minde which is one of the chiefe fiue, and is termed the <hi>Phantasie,</hi> and resteth in the foremost part of the brayne, I meane the <hi>phantasie,</hi> is hurt and disturbed by Satans meanes, and the outwarde senses buried, and by him maruelously troubled. Why then should we not so thinke of the mée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and presence of Sorcerers? And if drunken men, when hote vapours ascende out of their stomackes into their brayne, suppose they see such thinges as be absent: and if the sickenesse of melancholie doe persuade many thinges to those that are sicke of that disease, whiche they neyther
<pb facs="tcp:9717:46" rendition="simple:additions"/>
doe sée, nor are present: we may thinke and define that these thinges happen to Sorcerers by illusion of Satan, who is of greater force than any of the aboue named causes, to trouble the vertues and powers of the minde, and not to thinke that in déede such thinges be present, or that them selues be in place where they suppose. For Satan is able to hurt &amp; binde the powers of the minde, and strength of the body, as <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> teacheth, and as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him S. <hi>Augustine</hi> in the .vii. booke of <hi>Genesis</hi> vpon the letter the .xi. Chapter hath written. Besides this, the same S. <hi>Augustine</hi> in a certayne Epistle of his vnto his familiar friend <hi>Nebridius,</hi> which is the .lxxii. in number, distinguisheth the thrée kinds of our fantastical sightes and appearances. The first kinde is of them whiche our fantasie or imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion conceaueth of thinges whiche we haue seene. The seconde kinde is of thinges whiche our fantasie it selfe hath founde out, the lyke whereof it neuer see, nor hearde of before. The thirde kynde is of thinges whyche our imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation conceaueth and deuiseth vppon
<pb facs="tcp:9717:47"/>
the wordes and reporte of other. And these <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>oyes and imaginations of Sorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers are of the second kinde, namely when our fantasie of herselfe deuiseth and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineth many thinges. Which that I may more substantially confirme vnto you out of the same Authour, the same S. Augustine in the hundred and one Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle to <hi>Euodius</hi> of straunge sightes, wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, that when those sightes are so liuely and effectually represented vnto vs, that wee thinke verely wee haue seene them, for all that our soules doe not wander out of our bodies, neyther goe abroade in those places wherein wee thought our selues conuersaunt, but they remayne within our bodies, euen in the same moment wherein they behelde those thinges so euidently: so that it happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth by meanes of the obiectes that we see them. In the meane season our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dely senses are asleepe within vs, so that they can by no meanes be awaked, while wee bee occupied in this sighte: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it happeneth, that afterwarde wee beeing awaked, suppose that wee tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and dranke, and eate, and sawe
<pb facs="tcp:9717:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>
all those thinges. The reason is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the liuely and effectuall fourme of all those thinges was represented vnto our mynde, wherewith wee were then busied. And examples heereof are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly to bee found<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> in the same Sainct Augustine. For in the hundred Epistle, he maketh mention of a certayne Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of <hi>Carthage,</hi> called <hi>Gennadius,</hi> who doubting whether after this life there were another to bée hoped for, sawe the companies of Aungels, and hearde the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> singing so playnely in his sleepe, that hee thoughte hee was in heauen, whose body notwithstanding lay all the while in the bedde, and remayned in the Chamber, as hee him selfe after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde confessed. Likewise in the .xviij. booke <hi>De Ciuitate Dei,</hi> the .xviij. Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, hee telleth of another, who affirmed for a truth, that he conferred with a certen <hi>Platonicall</hi> Philosopher in his sléepe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Platoes</hi> writinges, of whom hee learned the Authours meaning in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne place, whiche before he vnderstoode not. In the booke which is intituled, <hi>Vitae Patrum,</hi> the life of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Fathers, it is written
<pb facs="tcp:9717:48"/>
of a certayne father, who not in the night, nor in a dreame, but at midde day, and broade light, when he behelde with his eyes his owne daughter, it seemed to him that he sawe a Cowe, whiche notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing others, and especially <hi>Macha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> acknowledged and testified that it was a humane creature, and a Uirgin. What <hi>Theophilus,</hi> haue not you your selfsomtime read in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> xvj. booke <hi>De Diebus Genialibus,</hi> whiche are written by <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander Neopolitanus,</hi> the .xxi. Chapter, of a certeyne accused person, who thought that he wente downe to hell, whereof he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to the Iudge moste euident te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies? For he discouered and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a certayne secrete of his, whiche was knowne to no man. What, in the xxvi. Canon of Bishop, the .v. question, whiche was copied foorth of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell of Aquilea, is it not there openly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, that all these voyces and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations of Sorcerers are but vayne showes, meere toyes, and illusions of the mynde, whyche Satan, chyefe workeman of suche trumperie, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senteth vnto them, theyr bodyes not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstandyng
<pb facs="tcp:9717:48" rendition="simple:additions"/>
remayning styll in the same place? In conclusion, that I may at length shut vp all this place, these bée the wordes either of S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> or whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer els was aucthour of that booke, which is intituled <hi>De spiritu &amp; litera,</hi> where in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 28. chapter he writeth thus. <hi>VVherefore they foretell certen thinges to come, and worke straunge wonders, whereby they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure and seduce men: By meanes whereof certen foolish women turning after Satan, being seduced by fantasies and illusions of Diuels, doo beleeue and professe, how in the night tyme they ryde abroade with Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana the Goddesse of the Pagans, or els with Herodias and Minerua, and other multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of women innumerable, and that they obey their commaundementes.

Moreouer, how could it come to passe, that the Sorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers could note the places, know the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons againe by their faces, remember the number, the trées that growe nigh the hed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, riuers, and distinguish the houses: if we say that these were but vayne shewes and representations of mynde, and that in very deede they were not present at those meetinges: why should they depart out of their owne houses, and out of their townes late in the night to méete there? why should they be wéery of their iourney, how should they returne personally and visibly from those places, vnlesse personally &amp; presently they had bin there, &amp; not by only dreaming or imagination of mynde? Thus <hi>Anthony</hi> the constant co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fessions of Sorcerers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, with other infinite testimonies are against you, &amp; your opinion. But you will say, these be their boastinges, and doting dreames: Yea, but surely they be very dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous dreames <hi>Anthony</hi>: For they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse this when they are neare their death, and when they are condemned and lead to execution for that offence, and when they
<pb facs="tcp:9717:50" rendition="simple:additions"/>
bée tormented, when such talke can helpe them no longer: Finally, it is thus in euery place. Moreouer, as the most godly Father <hi>Athanasius</hi> writeth in his booke of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie of Christ, the cogitations and thoughtes of our mynde, how stronge and déepe soeuer they bée, yet can they not cary our bodies from place to place, neither can they affect or touch those that bee absent. But sorcerers bodies are conueyed away: wherefore we must thinke that this chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth not alonly by cogitation of minde. And as concerning your arguments, I say, that they must be distinguished. There be certe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thinges whereof they falsly vaunt, which can not possibly bee done by course of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which notwithstanding they affirme that they doo them. These thinges happen vnto them through vaine illusion of mynd. But I beséech you, what cause, what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, what course or order of nature, doth stop or hinder that they should not be there present? specially since corporally and visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly they returne from thence, that is to say, in very deed, and during al that time were absent from those places, in which they were before. For the same accused person,
<pb facs="tcp:9717:51"/>
whereof you made mencion erewhyle, which went downe vnto hell, was twoo dayes absent, and when hée was diligently sought for throughout all the prison, yet could he not be found: wherfore, such thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges as are repugnant to the natures of our bodies, if they say y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they doo any such thing, they be false, and worthely to bee reputed mere illusions of the Diuell. Such as bée those whereof the counsell of <hi>Aquilea</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth mencio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as to ride in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Moone, to talke with <hi>Herodias,</hi> w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Diana,</hi> &amp; with <hi>Minerua,</hi> which are called the gods of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                     <hi>Paganes</hi>: and to speake with a man that is dead, and to sée any of them whom they cal the xij. wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies, that is to say, <hi>Hector, Achilles, Rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> &amp; such lyke, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> many other lyke mere fantasies &amp; vaine deuises of Satan, which by him are represented vnto the eyes or myndes of men. Of this sort also are they which you haue alleaged both out of s. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine, and also out of the booke <hi>De spiritu et anima,</hi> which in déed ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not be so, bicause the accomplishing and trueth therof, plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repugneth against the course of nature. But this which we affirme co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the assembling &amp; méeting togither of sorcerers,
<pb facs="tcp:9717:51" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and the maner of their cumming togither, what hath it in it contrary to the course of nature, or disagreeing from the force and essencie of our bodies? To conclude, they that doo so certenly define, that in those ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary visions, and rauishinges, and traunces of the mynd, alwayes our bodies are altogither absent fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the sightes which we then beholde: truely they speake more boldly then the holy seruant and Apostle of Christ Sainct <hi>Paule,</hi> who speaking of his owne rauishing, and taking vp (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, it was farre vnlyke to this kynde whereof wee now speake, for it was done by the hande and power of GOD, and not by Satan) in the second Epistle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> the xij. Chapter &amp; third verse, sayeth thus: <hi>And I know the same man, (whether in the bodie, or out of the bodie, I can not tell, God knoweth) was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vp into Paradise, and there heard vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable wordes, which are not lawfull for a man to vtter.</hi> These as I suppose, <hi>Anthony,</hi> will satisfie your doubtes, and I hope, declare them sufficiently vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you.</p>

                     <hi>Anthony,</hi> which that I may playn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refute, I deny that which you say, &amp; take vnto you for a graunted veritie: namely, that their true bodies were found to bee in the same chamber and bed, at what tyme they sayd y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they were away. There were rather certen counterfeit bodies placed in their steede by Satan, &amp; represented lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses: then the true bodies of the Sorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers. Doo you not remember I pray you, what <hi>Michol Dauids</hi> wife did, and what deuise she practized when she concealed the flight of her husband from her father <hi>Saule</hi> and his seruants, which sought to sley him? Haue you not read that which is written in the first of <hi>Samuel,</hi> the xix. chapter, how shee by craft and colourable meanes, but not by any Diuelish arte, nor after the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Sorcerers, in steed of <hi>Dauids</hi> bodie placed an image, laying pillowes vnder his head, and trimming him with garmentes so finely and cunningly, that they thought
<pb facs="tcp:9717:52" rendition="simple:additions"/>
surely <hi>Dauid</hi> was there, beholding the counterfeite so liuely set foorthe before their eyes. So likewise Satan, to the intente hee maye keepe from vs the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of his Pupilles, in steede of their true bodie, whiche is awaye, placeth there a false body, when wee chaunce to enquire. Whereby it commeth to passe, that many men suppose that Sorcerers are not bodely present at their assemblies, whiche themselues contende that they were at, and that because they perceyu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> and finde false and counterfeite bodies like vnto them layde in their Chambers, and beddes, by Satan, in stéede of their true bodies: But surely they that iudge so, are very muche abused.</p>

                  <p>I vnderstande what you say.

<pb facs="tcp:9717:53"/>
the .viij. verse, and also the fourth Chapter of <hi>Luke,</hi> the ninth verse, how he was cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Satan out of the desert vnto a pyna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of <hi>Hierusalem</hi> Temple?</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Anthony.</speaker>
                  <p>Yea it is very true. But that was done by the will of God. And all that matter was extraordinary.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Theophilus.</speaker>
                  <p>I easely graunt you that. And so likewise I say, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by the same wyll of God and his iust iudgement, it commeth to passe, that the Diuel can touch, cary, and conuey Sorcerers, that it may so appeare that they be altogether in his power. And if Satan durst touch so holy and vndefiled a body as Christes was, ouer which he could haue no power by reason of any sin: If he could take y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same Christ vp, &amp; carry him in the Ayre, the saucie presumer will not be afrayd to handle &amp; carry y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bodies of Sorcerers, knowing that before they haue geuen them selues vnto him, both body and soule. And if God haue geuen power vnto Satan ouer the soules of Sorcerers, to thintent they should be lead away from the fayth: he wyll much more geue him power ouer theyr bodies, to handle them, and cary them: For God will not so soone
<pb facs="tcp:9717:53" rendition="simple:additions"/>
geue vnto Satan power ouer the soules of men, as ouer theyr bodies, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the example of Iob. Iob, the second Chapter, the sixt verse. Finally, Satan wyll not alwayes take vpon him the trauayle of carrying and recarrying Sorcerers, but onely at some tymes, and when he will take from them all excuses of not méeting together, at theyr assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blyes.</p>

                  <p>Me thinckes he should cast them into an horrible feare, when he tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, or handleth them.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Theophilus.</speaker>
                  <p>You say trueth, if he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared or met with them in his fourme of a Diuell, which doubtlesse is most horrible and dreadfull, but he appeareth vnto them in another shape, and similitude. For in respect that he is an euyll Angell, he cannot be séene. But like as when first he assay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them and talketh with them, he doeth it in the resemblance of a man, or in some other tollerable and accustomed fourme: so likewise when he meaneth to carry the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he transfigureth himselfe into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lykenes of an horse, or a mule, or a bird, or some other liuing thing: Yea, sometime he caryeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <pb facs="tcp:9717:54"/>
foorth, and yet they see him not. For he geueth them a staffe, whiche they muste put betweene their legges, and at the say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of certen prayers in his name (which he teacheth and commaundeth them to doe) they thinke straight that the staffe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth them thither as they would goe, and so he perswadeth them that they be borne by the staffe, while he himselfe dothe car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie them. For beeing of the nature of Aungels, yea the Prince of the ayre, as sayth S. Paule to the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> the .vj. chapter, and .xij. verse, it is no maruell if he doe that whiche we by no meanes can doe, and doe it also with more agilitie and quicknesse than we can.</p>

                  <p>I haue heard reporte of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne Abbot named <hi>Bruno,</hi> who in a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute of an houre was caried by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell from <hi>Millayn</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi>: also of one <hi>Theophilus,</hi> of whom the like is reported. But what thinke you hereof, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> doe you suppose these examples to be true?</p>

                  <speaker>Theophilus.</speaker>
                  <p>Whether the reporte which goeth on these twayne, be true, or not, I neither knowe, neither doe muche force: but I confirme my selfe in mine
<pb facs="tcp:9717:54" rendition="simple:additions"/>
owne opinion with this reason, that if Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan through Gods sufferaunce can hurte and slay our bodies, as is gathered out of the storie of <hi>Iob,</hi> and others: muche more by his sufferaunce can he lifte them vp, carrie them, handle them, and vse them in all poyntes, as a wolfe can a shéepe whiche he hath stolen. Neither must we therfore suppose that Satan is an horse, or a mule, or a beast, as he then appeareth vnto our eyes. But if, as S. Paule sayth, the .ij, to the Corinthians, the .xij. chapter, and .xiiij. verse, he can transfourme him selfe into an Aungell of lighte, he can muche soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and with more facilitie put on the shape of these thinges, because hee can not so easely counterfeite the man of God, as he can resemble the shape of a Mule. Also <hi>Alexander Neopolitanus,</hi> whom while ere you commended for a substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall witnesse, in the fourth booke, and xix. chapter of his worke <hi>De Diebus Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nialibus,</hi> writeth of a certayne Monke cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Thomas,</hi> commonly accompted a cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible person, who was wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to tel, that if it had hapned him to be much offended with any of his brother Monkes, &amp; in that heate
<pb facs="tcp:9717:55"/>
of mynde had withdrawen himselfe into the desart, that then Satan would appeare vnto him in the lykenesse of a man, and would goe foorth talking with him a great way, persuading him to doo many thinges. And at length when they were come vnto a great streames side, in the same desart, he told how Satan would take him vp vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon his shoulders, &amp; carry him ouer to the further side of the water. Whereby it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth that it is no new thing, if Satan doe cary any, to thintent to win them, or to binde them more firmely vnto him.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Anthony.</speaker>
                  <p>But it séemeth scarse possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that he can carry a man so soone, speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the place being so farre distant, where as they say they doe meete.</p>

                  <p>I haue tolde you before what is playnly wrytten of Christe in the .iiij. of <hi>Luke,</hi> the fift verse, that he was in a moment brought vy Satan to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and al the kingdomes in the world shewen vnto him. Wherefore, <hi>Anthony,</hi> I sée no cause at all why you should so long doubt of this matter, since the celeritie &amp; quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb facs="tcp:9717:55" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of this carryar satan, is so great, and his power and force in workeing so nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: For none of all those thinges can let him, which hinder vs whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we make spéed about any thing. Neither is it so harde or paynefull to him to pearce the ayer when he runneth, as it is vnto vs. For he is of a most fine and subtile nature, after the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Angels, and not of a bodily sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, for that he is a spirit. And therefore Sainct Augustine in his booke, <hi>De Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natione Daemonum,</hi> the third Chapter, wryteth of him, that hée surpasseth the most swiftest men in runninge, or any other beast, yea the birdes themselues. Whose opinion <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> folow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in the <hi>Summe</hi> of <hi>quest. C.x.</hi> the third question wryteth, that these grosse bodies doe geue place vnto Satan, through which therefore he conueyeth himself with more expedition, bicause they shall not lette or hinder him. And that you may bée no longer in doubt of this matter, <hi>Anthony,</hi> nor varyable in your mynde, I wyl bring foorth vnto you also, both sayinges, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of profane wryters, that you may not suppose y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this hath béen of later times
<pb facs="tcp:9717:56"/>
receyued and beléeued only of Christians. For is there any thing, I pray you, more notorious in al histories of the Romanes, than the sodayne taking away of <hi>Romu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> first authour and founder of the Citie of <hi>Rome</hi>? Who in sight of many witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses was taken away by Satan, for the horrible deuinations, superstitions, theftes, and stealing of women, whiche he had instituted and commaunded. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit others write otherwise of his death, yet <hi>Plutarche</hi> an author of great credite, and amongest all Greeke and Latin wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters euer accompted the moste diligent and trustiest, reporteth thus of him: namely, that for a truthe vppon a day he was by Satan taken vp into the ayre, and carried away, all the people of Rome bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing present, and beholding it. Which that it was done by Satan, the sundry circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of the matter, whiche by him are there recited, doe sufficiently declare. For before this was done, there arose a great storme and tempest in the ayre, with darknesse as it had béene nighte, and also horrible thunder, in so muche that all the people which was assembled, béeing ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
<pb facs="tcp:9717:56" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in these terrible accidences, most fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ran thence away: which is a most e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident example of the carrying away of a mans bodie by Satan, which that it may be done, the same <hi>Plutarch</hi> setteth foorth and confirmeth by twoo examples, namely by <hi>Aristeus Proconesiensis,</hi> and <hi>Cleomedes Astipaleensis.</hi> For <hi>Aristeus</hi> was taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by a Diuell out of a fullers shoppe, and in a moment caried into a citie in <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly</hi> called <hi>Crotona,</hi> standing in <hi>Calabria,</hi> where hee talked with many men. And <hi>Cleomedes,</hi> being of bodie as huge &amp; bigge as a Giaunt, and a fierce man, who hauing miserably &amp; cruelly slaine certen children, and being therfore narrowly and diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pursued after by their fathers, was dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to such extremitie, that with much a doo he shut himself vp in a cheast, which cheast being founde and broken vp by the angry fathers of the children, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>Cleomedes</hi> was not found there: for hee was immediately caried away from thence by a diuel. I would here bring forth the carying away of <hi>Alexander,</hi> surnamed <hi>Sextus,</hi> Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> which is in euery mans mouth, and is constantly reported to
<pb facs="tcp:9717:57"/>
haue bin done by Sata<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But I am affeard least you should thinke that I doo it in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of the <hi>Popes,</hi> vnto who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> truely I beare little good will: wherefore, vpon all these thinges it may be concluded, that it is an easie matter vnto Satan, who is of his owne nature an Angell, to take vp our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and to carry them elswhere, and that in a moment. In confirmation whereof, I can recite vnto you that which is written in the story of <hi>Susan,</hi> the xxxv. verse, of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacuc</hi>: for it is written there, how hee was carried in a moment foorth of <hi>Iudaea,</hi> into <hi>Babilon</hi> by an Angel.

vnto you that which you require. And first, you must not think y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Sata<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> willeth all sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerers to vse those ointments. For he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth but certen of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to doo that, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he perceiueth to be either fearfull to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or more deintie then y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they can abide his horrible touching of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, like as are wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and certe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> men also. For by those con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections wherewith he willeth them to bée oynted, he benu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth their senses, that they shall feele no payne while they are carried, or stand in horrour of his handes, or of his bearing of them.

How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, Satan also therin shooteth at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther marke, namely to imitate and falsly to cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>terfeit the holy sacraments of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church, ordeined by god, wherby the miserable sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerers may learne &amp; accustome themselues

                  <p>It séemeth vnto mée, that Sorcerers can not intoxicate any, vnlesse they cast in, &amp; minister poyson vnto them. For it séemeth vnto mee incredible that they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hurt only by meere enchau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tments, figures, wordes, hallowinges, curfinges, or charecters, vnlesse they mingle poison ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. But if Satan geue them the poyson which they mingle, or teach them how to mingle it: then doo I not doubt but that they may easily intoxicate. And I doo not deny,
<pb facs="tcp:9717:58" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but that Satan is passing skilfull in such kinde of witchcraft and Sorcery. For hee knoweth excellent well the nature and properties of all thinges created, which S. Augustine witnesseth in the third booke <hi>De Diuinatione Daemonum.</hi> But surely I can not persuade my self, that hee can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxicate or hurt any man without poyson, powder, or roote. For as for wordes, num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, figures, a certen fourme of woordes, with certen peculiar mumblinges of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in prescribed order of wordes, with charecters: were not deuised to inuenim men, but plainly vnto other maner purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, lyke as father <hi>Irenaeus</hi> plainly prooueth in the second booke, the xl. &amp; xliij. chapters, which vaine opinion of some, not only that good Christian father, but also Aristotle an Ethnick writer, in some place laugheth at, much lesse ought wee Christians allow it. Moreouer, this matter is ruled ouer by most certen demonstrations of naturall Philosophie, namely that there can no acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be done without a meane comming be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene, and applied to the extreame and outwarde partes of the thing suffering. As for example. If you shoue mée, your hande
<pb facs="tcp:9717:59"/>
toucheth me: when I waxe warme against the fyre, first the fyre warmeth the ayre, then the ayre warmeth mée, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not to passe, that any meane co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth betwéene, when there is any intoxication or inchaunting committed by wordes, or charecters, or figures, or any fourme or or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of wordes. And therefore <hi>Pliny,</hi> a wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter well séene in all kinde of learning, in the xxviij. booke &amp; ij. chapter, of the history of nature, plainly denieth with mee, that there can no such thing be done.</p>

                  <p>First by vertue of their league and couenant, Satan commeth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them when they coniure and call him, accomplishing their requestes, &amp; perfour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming whatsoeuer hee promised should be done, by vertue and force of those figures, wordes, or charecters, to the end hee may séeme true and mightie, and to beare them in hand that the thinges which he hath she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed them are of great power and effect: By which meanes, he both maketh these vayne people more beholding vnto him, and enforceth them to worship him with more deuotion. And thus hee manifestly transporteth vnto creatures, the office and duetie of the maiestie and power of God, whereby men may more willingly forsake God, and amazedly cleaue vnto creatures, that is to say, become perfect Idolaters. Moreouer hee endeuoreth by this meanes, after the maner of an Ape, to counterfeit and imitate the true sacramentes which God hath geuen to his church, and to bring them in contempt, and to make his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeites match vnto them, finally, hee tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the force &amp; effect of the thinges which
<pb facs="tcp:9717:60" rendition="simple:additions"/>
are signified, vnto the signes which doo sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie them.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Anthony.</speaker>
                  <p>These thinges then are not wrought by woordes alone, or by certen fourmes of Charecters only, but by media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of certen poysons priuely and secretly vsed by Satan him self, after an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne maner, which he hath not taught the Sorcerers.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Theophil.</speaker>
                  <p>You say well <hi>Anthony</hi>: For there is in Satan great craft and cunning to couer his wickednesse, &amp; mischief, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the couenant which hee maketh with them, séemeth vnto mée to be like the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine which twoo théeues make, when they goe forth into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> woddes to thintent to rob, for that they may the better hide the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, and the more easily and warely lay wayte for such as trauaile by the way. Thus doo they, and thus agrée they, that one of them shall euermore be séene in the way, the other lye hid in the woodes, who notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing at a certen whistle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; watchword, whereupon they haue agréed, starteth forth and murthereth the traueiler, howbeit the other his fellowe who is also priuie of the fact, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> most part, neither séeth, ne know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb facs="tcp:9717:61"/>
with what weapon the other doth the déede. The same also may be declared vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you by another example. Noble men which beare any great hatred or malice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst other, are woont to retaine bold and desperate Ruffians into seruice, and to haue them alwayes attending vpon them, vnto whom when they shall geue a signe by some priuie meanes, which none know but themselues, then doo they sodeinly flye vpon those whom their Maister and Lord is fallen out withall, yea many tymes though their Maisters be absent, or not sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, who notwithstanding willed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to doo so. In like maner, at the signes and tokens appointed, Satan is immediately present, fulfilling whatsoeuer the Sorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers will him to doo, that he may alwayes haue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> more &amp; more obedient vnto him. Yea, I wil moreouer say thus much, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> these figures, &amp; charecters are of themselues but meere toyes, &amp; colourable trifles to bleare mens eyes, which being layd before the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by their most wicked schoolemaister, doo kéepe vnto him those his wretched schollars, who séeke for no other, nor truer cause of that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent, although in déed they be of no force to
<pb facs="tcp:9717:61" rendition="simple:additions"/>
bring the thing to effect which they goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, neither doo the Sorcerers vnderstand how much they doo auaile. But like as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten iuglers which would séeme to doo many straunge feates in the midst of a circle or ring of people, by sundry gestures &amp; casting of the handes, and with much babling and prittle prattle of wordes, doo fil &amp; wéery the eares and eyes of the lookers on, that they shall not perceiue how in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place of one lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle bal, they lay down thrée or foure, which they kept couertly betweene their fingers, (which notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding is all done by nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenes of their handes:) so likewise Satan representeth these vaine, and friuolous co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours &amp; showes of figures, &amp; woordes; vnto the eyes of his accomplises, whom hee is willing to kéepe from the diligent inquiry of suche matters y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>, being amoped with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> only, they may be stay<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Tell me then <hi>Theophilus,</hi> by what meanes worketh Sata<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in déed, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest he would séeme to worke by enchaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, or superstitious describing of Charecters, or certen fourmes of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>

                  <speaker>Theophil.</speaker>
                  <p>I am about to doo so. And to begin with all, I am certen and well assured of this, that Satan can doo nothing but by naturall meanes, and causes. For whatsoeuer hee doth eyther by him self, or by his y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Magicians &amp; Sorcerers: it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togither eyther illusion of their myndes and eyes, or only the true effect of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall causes. As for any other thing, or that is of more force, hee can not doe it.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Anthony.</speaker>
                  <p>Can hee not also worke mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, as Sainct <hi>Paule</hi> sayeth in the second to the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> the second chapter the ix. verse. And Sainct <hi>Iohn</hi> in the reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the sixtene Chapter, and fourtenth verse.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:9717:62" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to the naturall course and disposition thereof created by God. As for example: when iron swimmeth vpon the water, as is reported in the story of <hi>Elias</hi> in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond booke of kinges, the vi.

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Theophil.</speaker>
                  <p>Truely you haue properly defined a miracle. For as Sainct Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine writeth, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> must only be called a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, which surmounteth the power of all thinges created, neither can be wrought by them. So that a miracle is only the worke of Gods power, being most worthely and properly to be tearmed by that name. But Sainct <hi>Paule,</hi> and the Reuelation in those places which you haue commended, vse not this worde so strictly and precisely, but rather more at large, for any kinde of woorke which may séeme straunge and meruelous vnto men, although it procéede from naturall meanes and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. So that this worde Miracle, is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentymes vsed for that which may more
<pb facs="tcp:9717:63"/>
rightly bée called a woonder. For as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching a Miracle, Satan truely is able to worke none, as you haue most properly described a Miracle.</p>

As for example sake: when y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> great &amp; cunning workman, &amp; also famous Philosopher <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chytas Tarentinus,</hi> shewed openly to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple a doue of wood which flue in the ayre, it was a wonderful thing, but it was no mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle. For this motion was caused in the

                  <p>For sundry causes, &amp; chiefly for thrée. And first in respect of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie of his nature aboue ours. For
<pb facs="tcp:9717:64"/>
hée is of an Angelicall and Spirituall na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and wee are earthly and carnall, by reason whereof hee can doo many thinges which we can not. Secondly, for his moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, and the great quicknes of dooing his actions. For in a moment he can come so long a iourney: as wee that are heauy and slowe, can not doo the like in six dayes.

                  <p>Fyrst, bicause that in woorking of miracles it behooueth to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy &amp; take away the nature from thinges which God hath geuen them, which Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan can not doo: for it belongeth to god on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> as hee can create and make the nature
<pb facs="tcp:9717:64" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of thinges: so can he also ouerthrow, and destroy it. Secondly, that in a miracle it is néedefull to geue vnto the thing, new vertues and properties, which he can by no meanes doe. For the true God is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aucthour and creatour of the properties which are in thinges. Thirdly, that a true miracle is such a worke which surpasseth the vertue and power of all thinges crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, be they neuer so excellent. Wherefore Sainct Peter the Apostle, in the third of the Actes, the .xij. verse, when he had hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the lame man, and had wrought a true miracle, sayde thus: <hi>Yee men of Israëll, vvhy doe you wonder at this, or vvhy doe you looke vpon vs so earnestly, as though vve had vvrought it by our owne power or godlynesse, that this man should vvalke? The God of Abraham, the God of Isaac. &amp;c.</hi> By which wordes it is signified, as you sée, that the power to worke miracles, is proper vnto God onely.</p>

                  <p>But the blessed Angels, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, and many other holy men, haue wrought miracles.</p>

                  <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
                  <p>Truely they haue wrought miracles, by the working of God in them.
<pb facs="tcp:9717:65"/>
For the power which worketh them, is in God onely, and in him onely resident, and neuer transported to any creature, for as it is written in <hi>Esay,</hi> God will neuer geue away his peculiar glory, to another. Wherefore, they whom you haue last re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyted, Good Angells, Apostles, Prophets, and holy men, in woorking of those mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles which they are reported to haue done, were onely gods instruments in working of them, &amp; that meere passiue, not actiue, as they terme them: and yet notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it followeth not, that if God vsed the ministrie of those his seruauntes, he doth also vse Satan likewyse, woorking mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles by him also. For God of his iustice wyll not communicate his glory in such measure vnto Satan and Diuells, as hée geueth it vnto the blessed Angells, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men: Which is euidently confirmed by this onely example, in as much as <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> the seruauntes of God, wrought true miracles, which <hi>Pharaos</hi> Magicians, although they were schollars very well practized in the artes of Satan, and his most excellent mynisters, could neuer doe the lyke, acknowledging the
<pb facs="tcp:9717:65" rendition="simple:additions"/>
true effect thereof to be wrought by the finger of God onely, and confessing that the thinges which they did, farre surmoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the course of nature, as it is wrytten in the eight Chapter of <hi>Exodus,</hi> the eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenth verse. And the cause of this diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie betwéene Satan and the true ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntes of God, and the diuersitie of his counsell and prouidence, is this, in that Satan in woorking of miracles, séeketh not the glory of God: but the good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells, and holy men, haue onely regarde and respect to that. So that many tymes these men are the instrumentes of God, but he neuer is. And although this bée true, that Satan of himselfe can doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but how much, and when it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth God to geue him leaue: so lykewise neither can hée destroy nor chaunge the order of thinges determyned by God, neither hath God geuen him such power, neither that he may woorke by any other thinges then naturall, although some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes they be hid from vs, finally he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forceth them with such celeritie, that the whole woorke séemeth vnto vs to be a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle. For he quickly gathereth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meanes
<pb facs="tcp:9717:66" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and causes whereby he worketh. As for example, he soone gathereth cloudes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to cause rayne: he soone driueth toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther &amp; thickneth the Ayre, that thereby he may represent vnto our sight some shape, or thickened visible body: and in a mome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t he can compound poysons to do hurt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, &amp; immediatly he can resemble, or driue away whatsoeuer is of him required, or demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded. Moreouer, he worketh all these thinges with such swiftnes, that the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition thereof seemeth straunge vnto vs, which notwithstanding he worketh al by naturall causes. Wherefore, as I haue sayde before, figures, drawing of lines and circles, noyses, enchauntments, breefly, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious mumbling of certen prayers, are not the causes of such thinges as the Sorcerers doe worke, but rather pleadges and tokens onely of Satans promises vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. So then Satan himselfe worketh those thinges, which they thinke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues to haue done, by vertue of those meanes. For he hath instituted these tokens, which he will not haue seeme either vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, either impossible, or friuolous. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all those thinges are done by meanes
<pb facs="tcp:9717:66" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of Satan onely. Wherein the opinion of Saint Ierome onely, who doubteth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, ought not to moue vs. For he wauereth therein, and Iohn Chrisostome is flatly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, in his homilies vpon the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle of Sainct Paule to the <hi>Galathians,</hi> the iii. Chapter, and seconde verse, and others also of no lesse aucthoritie. And among la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wryters, what <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent well learned Deuine, wryteth vpon the .xxviij. Chapter, of the first booke of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel,</hi> all men doe well knowe. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to conclude in fewe woordes, Satan woorketh all those thinges vpon couenau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. By the same meanes it commeth to passe, that Sorcerers doe coniure &amp; exorcize, as they call it, the Diuell: or call him foorth, or call him vp, or speake with him face to face, hauing apointed and agreeed vppon such couenauntes, that at sometimes he should appeare, and at other tymes depart away<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> After this maner, <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> the seconde king of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> a great Magician &amp; Sorcerer, if euer there were any, communed and talked oftentymes w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Diuells, as <hi>Plutarch,</hi> a graue authour, wryteth in his lyfe.

                  <p>Why would you learne this of mée, which they them selues doe not knowe? God onely knoweth that, in whose hande lyeth our death and lyfe, not in the power of the Sorcerer, no not of the Diuell him selfe, as it is wrytten in the eight Chapter, and ninth Uerse, of <hi>

                        </gap>cclesiasticus.</hi> For the mynde and desyer of the Sorcerer is varyable in that poinct: many times to doe hurt, onely for a tyme, they caste theyr poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons vppon men, and oftentymes theyr poysons bée mortall and deadly. And therefore when they bée threatned, they seeke meanes to vndooe and take away theyr poysons from those whome they haue bewitched and poysoned, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they requyre healpe of the Diuell,
<pb facs="tcp:9717:67" rendition="simple:additions"/>
howbeit sometimes they cannot vndooe it, whatsoeuer they attempt, forasmuch as God hath otherwyse determined of vs. For he hath appointed the tearme of our lyfe, which we can not passe, as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in Iob, the fouretenth Chapter, and fift verse.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Anthony.</speaker>
                  <p>Ouer and besides this, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> after they bée come intoo the Iudges handes, and caste intoo Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, can they then vse those their poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and doe any harme?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Theophilus.</speaker>
                  <p>If I shall saye what I thinke, I wyll aunswere, that they can, if so bée they haue any conference with theyr maister Satan. But if you aske mee what the common people think thereof: surely, that they can not. So that if they can by anye meanes, fréely and commodiously come by those theyr Diuellishe poysons, and conferre wyth Satan, as otherwyse they myght if they were at home: I suppose they can intoxicate &amp; poyson men when they are in
<pb facs="tcp:9717:68"/>
prison. Neither doeth the iudges authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of it selfe, nor the place, bring any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment thereto. For proofe of which myne opinion, I may bring this, in that Satan himselfe hath strangled many sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerers in prison, or beaten them to death with his fistes, and also when they haue béene condemned by the Iudges, and layed vp fast in prison, he hath brought them to death, and hanging: Whereof I could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite vnto you almost infinite examples. Howbeit it séemeth vnto me, that Sorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers when they be in prison can no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> intox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icate, for two causes. The first is, for that they cannot commodiously come by their poysons, when they be in prison. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde, for that they dare not confer boldly with Satan their instructer, and master, for they feare that they are watched: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, they are bounde and tyed, and they cannot haue their poysons, but they must haue a witnesse thereof, that is, the kéeper of the prison, to prie and see what they doe. And that is the thing that they feare most, that they may not be espied of the iudges. So that for the most part sorcerers whyle they be in prison, hurt no body. Wherfore,
<pb facs="tcp:9717:68" rendition="simple:additions"/>
wise and diligent Iudges haue herein a special regarde, to come vpon them sodain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, before they be looked for, to search and try them. Finally, Sorcerers are affearde to vse theyr poysons when they be bounde and in hould, least they should be conuicted thereof, which might be easely done. For Sorcerers are a most fearful and coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kinde of people, hauing renounced God, wherefore they be wary, and looke very circumspectly to themselues.</p>

                  <p>IT is not my duetie, <hi>Anthony,</hi> to make or set foorth Lawes, which Kinges and Princes in euery Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie may doe onely. Moreouer, the trade and custome of men haue so preuay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led now a dayes, that the punishmentes for wickednesse, are almost nowe all at wyll and pleasure. This much therefore I can aunswere you, that Sorcerers are worthy of the common and open hatred of all men, of what sort soeuer they bée, in that they be the open enemies of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, and of God that created them. For they be most wicked runnagates from the fayth, false forswearers of Gods power, traytours to the maiestie of God, most vile starters a side, most foully vnfayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to God, most filthie drudges to the
<pb facs="tcp:9717:69" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Diuell: finally, most horrible diuellishe witches, and deceauers. Wherefore the Magistrate may very well punishe the Sorcerer, both as a witch, and as a run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagate from the fayth, bicause both he hath forsaken GOD his creatour, and openly gone into the féelde and taken part with Satan. Whereby it commeth to passe, that by the Lawe of God, a Sorcerer is condemned to dye, <hi>Deut.</hi> the eightenth Chapter, and tenth verse: and in another place, Sorcery is accompted among the greatest and most gréeuous crimes, the first of <hi>Samuel,</hi> the fiftenth Chapter, and xxv. verse. Likewise the holy Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call counsells of Fathers, doe detest and condemne them, as in the .lx.lxj. and .lxvj. article, the first, second, and third questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of the seconde counsell of <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> which are prouisions in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non Lawe.

<pb facs="tcp:9717:70"/>
satisfied, in his authentike Nouel, in the lxv. constitution, hath there prouided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them a more greeuous punishment. Finally, there was neuer yet any man of auncient or late tymes, being of any good minde and perswasion, which confessed not, that these were the worst men that ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and therefore iudged them worthy of most seuere punishment.</p>

                  <p>That we ought to haue no fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship with Satan, whether it be directly and mediately, or els indirectly and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, as they tearme it: Neither ought we to séeke any relief by his help, ayde, or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell.

                  <p>That therefore they are to be vsed, your argument is very weake and féeble: we must haue regard, rather to the commaundement of God, which forbiddeth vs in any wise to séeke vnto Sorcerers, as appeareth in the xviii. of <hi>Deut.</hi> the x. verse. For what doth Satan worke other by that meanes, then to leade vs away from the feare of the true God, and to pull vs vnto him? For looke whatsoeuer help we requir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of him to cure our bodies, it redoundeth to the hurt and destruction of our soules. For by this meanes, men seperate them selues from God, which is the true death of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>oule. Whereby it foloweth, that all the help and ayde that commeth by Satan and Sorcerers, is deadly poyson to the soule, which aboue all thinges wee ought to es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chewe, yea more then we would a Dog, or
<pb facs="tcp:9717:74" rendition="simple:additions"/>
a Snake. But whereas it is sometime al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged, that their meanes haue done some men ease and pleasure: how much I pray you is it, or how seldome hath it chaunced? since among ten y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> flie to them for succour, there is scarce one, or not one, that is relée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, or findeth help. And againe, the effectes are not to be weighed vpon the successe, but vpon the commaundement of God. For he that hath stolen, oftentimes liueth in weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thier state: is theft therefore to be allowed? Admit then that all which séeke such reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, doo alwayes escape and well recouer, and if we graunt so much: yet forasmuch as the expresse word of God commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth the contrarie, we ought not accept it, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is offred, much lesse voluntarely goe séeke it. For whensoeuer we runne to any other for helpe, sauing God only, therin we vtter the most shamefull distrust and infidelitie of our mindes, our rebellion against God, and most wicked contempt of his power. By which wickednes of ours, we prouoke his wrath against vs, and chiefly heape vpon vs eternall damnation.</p>

                  <p>How then I pray you? may wee not by any meanes vse the helpe and
<pb facs="tcp:9717:75"/>
ayde of Sorcerers, therby to séeke any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leife or ease in our afflictions?</p>

                  <p>Some vse therin a distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. They suppose that if the Magistrate will and commaund vs so to doo, then may wee with safe conscience vse their helpes, and remedies: Otherwise they hold opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that it is not graunted to vs, nor law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for vs. So that when the Magistrate biddeth vs séeke their helpe, and wee our selues of our owne accord doo not séeke vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, therein they say, if wee admit their helpes, we doo not offend at all: But if we our selues of our owne accorde, doo runne vnto them, then they say, wee desire their help: we flatter them, curry w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> them, and frendly require them to come helpe vs: and therein we offend gréeuously. But if we not seeking it, the Magistrate notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeth vs to doo it, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> finde we their help almost against our will, &amp; in so dooing, wee are w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out fault or grudge of conscience: for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Magistrate putteth in his foote, as it were the aucthoritie of god, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we must obey, bicause hee hath his power from god. This is the foundation &amp; ground of this distinction. But how weake, yea
<pb facs="tcp:9717:75" rendition="simple:additions"/>
rather how vaine &amp; false it is, I pray you consider and iudge, <hi>Anthony.</hi> First Sainct <hi>Paul</hi> generally forbiddeth in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iii. to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                     <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes,</hi> the viii. verse, that we shal neuer doo euyll, that good thereby may ensue vnto vs, by whose soeuer aucthoritie we are so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded, either Iudges, Magistrates, or what euer els he bée. Moreouer, I thinke, we may also reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thus, a <hi>Pari,</hi> by the like. If the Iudge, and Magistrate bid vs woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship Idoles, if he bid vs steale, commit ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ultery, embrace Satan: may wee there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doo so with safe conscience, bicause the Magistrate biddeth vs? There is no man I thinke, will graunt this, that is wel in his wittes. Yea, that more is, if the same Magistrate commaunde the Sorcerer to helpe vs by his <hi>Satanicall</hi> arte, and also will vs to suffer our selues to bee cured by that art, commaunding vs fully to yéeld our selues vnto his meanes, and wee doo so: we both commit, and consent vnto euyl. And if we should otherwise al the dayes of our life lie sick in our bed, yet ought we not run to any such meanes &amp; artes of Satan, no, although the chéefe magistrate doo wil &amp; commaund the same: For it can not bee
<pb facs="tcp:9717:76"/>
otherwise chosen, but that therein wee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge Satans power, whose help we vse and stay vs vpon, whom notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in our Baptime, we haue before who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly renounced and forsaken. Neither lyeth it in the power of Satan, to make vs liue, or die, but in Gods hand only. But in this poinct a man may both geue counsell, and this may also be graunted: If he that is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a sorcerer, can by no superstitious mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and no dealing with the Diuell, but only by rules and preceptes of Phisicions, and by ordinary and alowable medicines, restore vs to health: then may we vse his hand, helpe, and meanes, with safe consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and due obedience to God. For when the medicines which are ministred vnto vs, haue nothing in them that is reprooued as nought, or defiled with artes of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, but are grounded vpon true and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall causes, that are euident vnto vs: then may wee accept them, not regarding whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were a man or a woman, a citizen or a countrey man, that teacheth, or apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them. For all that are accompted com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly witches and Sorcerers, are not so in déede, and many there are that haue bin
<pb facs="tcp:9717:76" rendition="simple:additions"/>
suspected thereof vndeseruedly. Wherfore, now at the length, let vs thus conclude, out of the premisses, that we may not, nor ought not, to vse the help of Sorcerers, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse we our selues will be of the number of them, and forsake our true God and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, which they doo, as often as they haue any dealinges with Satan, or require or receyue of him knowledge of remedie.</p>

                  <p>As concerning the cure of intoxications, <hi>Anthony,</hi> I wil not doubt to affirme this much, after S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> that the most learned Phisitions, are, for the

more part to séeke in such kinde of diseases, not knowing what remedies to minister, they are so straunge, new, and priuie. For they come forth of Satans shop, and they are wrought by his artes, which for the most part are vnknowne vnto vs mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall men. Howbeit, the helpe of Phisick is not to bee contemned in them, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diligently to bee sought and applyed, and all wayes and meanes are to be proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued which that facultie sheweth, and the counsell thereof to bée insued, that if it shall please God, wee may recouer our former health. For hée can blesse those good and holsome medicines, and restore vs to as perfect health as wee were before. For Phisicke is a most excellent gift of GOD vnto men, as it is read in the xxxviij. Chapter, and seconde verse of <hi>Ecclesiasticus,</hi> whose effectes are great: which hath many tymes before, and may now also at this present, if it please God, restore many that are intoxicate and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched. But when wee haue prooued all lawfull meanes, and notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding are able to doo no good, yet must wee by no meanes runne to Sorcerers,

nor séeke to dryue one mischéefe away with another, or rather with a woorse, and not loose the soule in seeking to heale the bodie: although to to many wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and vngodly men doo so now a dayes.

                  <p>ANd this is the truest &amp; surest way, in my opinion, whereby wee may kepe our selues safe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit also, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> meanes standeth with good reason, which some counsell vs to vse, that they may not hurt vs, namely, that we haue no familiar conuersation with them, neither admit them into our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, although they séeke vpon vs, and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vs neuer so much. For this kynde of people, is of al other, most full of flattery and dissimulation, who folowing the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and propertie of their mayster the Diuell, doo flatter those most swéetely, whom they indeuour and studie to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ley most traytrously. Moreouer, I would wish that this my chéefest remedie &amp; best coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, in this behalf, were taken, that they
<pb facs="tcp:9717:80" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hurt vs not: which is this, to wit, that all Iudges of Assise, which sit vppon lyfe and death, but especially, all Barons, and Lordes of the Parliament, were admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, that letting passe all vaine and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious disputations of this matter, they would wholy apply them selues to this, diligently to enquire after such persons, and when they haue founde them out, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerely to punish them. For there is no vy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler pestilence, nor that can be named more execrable and cruell against man kynde, then are Sorcerers, whom the last law in the title, <hi>De Maleficis,</hi> in the <hi>Code,</hi> would haue euery man that knoweth them to apprehend them, commit them to holde, and bringe them to iudgement: this crime hath alwayes séemed so detestable. And I would to God, <hi>Anthony,</hi> that those men to whom God hath geuen the authoritie to make Lawes, and execute Iustice, had taken such order by theyr lawes, that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Iudge should haue absolute and full authoritie within his circuite, territory, and precinct, to make away and put to death, these periured runnagates from the Fayth, and most wicked kynd of men,
<pb facs="tcp:9717:81"/>
that they might not through the long pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing of Iudgement, and sundry brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinges of, and circumstances of apeales &amp; remouing the matter, which they bring in and vse, at length escape away fréely out of the Iudges handes. As it chaunceth oftentimes. For there is geuen vnto the gouerner of euery prouince, full authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and iurisdiction concerninge murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, and such as rob men vpon the high wayes, and other fellons, to doe his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to the vttermost on them for theyr due execution: and why should they not likewise haue authoritie to determine of those crimes also, without any apealing from them? and that, since the offence of him is farre worse and more intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that slayeth a man with poyson, then that killeth him with a sworde: and of him that doeth it priuely, then that setteth vpon him openly. Now this is the last poinct, <hi>Anthony,</hi> whereof I haue to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish you, as beeing the conclusion of our whole disputation: How all men ought to perceyue and vnderstand by those thinges which we haue vttered beefore, after what sort, and howe continually we
<pb facs="tcp:9717:81" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ought to commende our selues to GOD, least that we fall into the snares of wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and Sorcerers, and be hurt by them, for they are our mortall enemyes, and they bee passinge secret: As we are also bounden to geue most hartie thankes vnto the same our God, that he hath defended vs from the craftes of Satan, so deadly a foe of oures, that we should not fall into the same errour that Sorcerers doe, and most miserably runne into the denying, and forswearing of his name. Finally you sée, <hi>Anthony,</hi> with howe great prayse the infinite goodnes, and wonderfull proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of our good god &amp; heauenly father to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes mankinde, is to be extolled and commended. His infinite goodnes, that whereas there haue béen so many Sorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers in all ages, that haue so wickedly and so traytrously denyed him vtterly, and chosen Satan for theyr God: hée had not vtterly consumed and destroied the whole world, which he might haue doon most iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. His wonderful prouidence, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> although Sata<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> endeuor very dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly to draw men away from their saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which is in god, working in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> very craftely, &amp; mightely:
<pb facs="tcp:9717:82"/>
Yet God notwithstanding, through his méere grace, preserueth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> greater number of men, now at this present, euen from his snares, restrayneth his power, disapoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth his purposes, finally, hath tofore, and doeth so euermore worke, that the better number escapeth &amp; hath the vpper hande, through feare of whom, the wicked are kept in awe, that they can not hurt as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as they would, and the elect, &amp; chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God thereby are not drawen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from the fayth, but constantly conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue therein. Unto which our God euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting, almightie, and most louing: bée all prayse, honour, and glory, for euermore. Amen. Will you aske of me any thing els, <hi>Anthony</hi>?</p>
