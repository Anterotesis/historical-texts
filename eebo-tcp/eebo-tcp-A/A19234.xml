         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>And ſo concludingly, in decrepit aige he muſt neede ſuffer the impotencie thereof, and the miſerie of many ſore languors: and finally be ſequeſtred from this lyfe and worldly vanities thereof. And thus he neuer ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth fyrme in one ſtay.</p>

               <p>Homo natus est de muliere bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ui viuens tempore, repletur multis miſerijs: Qui, quaſi flos egreditur, &amp; eonteritur, &amp; fugit velut vmbra, &amp; nunquam in eodem statu per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manet. &amp;c.</p>

            <p>And thus our tyme reuoluing by continuall altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, (to conclude and finiſhe our perillous pilgrimage in this vaile of teares) ſucceedeth dollorus Death: the which no man by naturall courſe can eſchue. And of

the time, the place, the maner, or the kind of his death, is no man that naturally knoweth: and then according to his deſeruing he ſhall haue his dome.</p>
            <p>Therefore, ſythen our time is but ſhort and vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne, and by reaſon of diuers impedimentes ryght daungerus, it ſhoulde be the rather more profitably ſpent: For as Sainct Bernard ſayth, There is nothyng committed to the diſpoſition of Man, more precious then time. All be it, many worldly men labour and turmoyle them ſelues with weerineſſe in worldly tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels, waſtyng their dayes in meare vanitie. And carnall Creatures, blinded with ſenſuall appetites, lothſomely conſume their precious tyme, wherein they might at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne vnto knowledge and ſoules health, making no more accompt of loſt tyme (whiche is vnrecouerable) then as it were but of vyle price, and of no value.</p>

Yet is there no exerciſe or labour taken in hand, nor tyme better

For the knowledge of Scripture, by many rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, ſtrengthneth our Pacience, and geueth vs conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation in all aduerſitie. VVherefore, the vnderſtanding of it to euery eſtate higher or lower, is both honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, pleaſant, and profitable, as Caſſianus ſayth.</p>
            <q>Non aliqua in mundo potest eſſe fortuna, quam literarum non auget glorioſa notitia.</q>
            <p>Yet notwithſtandyng, holy Scripture hath a ſpeciall prerogatiue beyonde all other doctrine, or prophane compiled matters. VVhetefore Sainct Ierome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared holy Scripture to a Mirror, or a Glaſſe, ſaying.</p>

            </q>
            <p>For like as a Glaſſe ſheweth a man the ſpots, defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, and faultes of his face, the which by the ſight of his eye, he can not diſcerne: ſo the declaration of holy Scripture lightneth a mans reaſon, and maketh him more profoundly to know the goodnes of God, his owne vnthankfulnes, the daunger of ſinne, the vallure of vertue, the vicious vanitie of this world, the ſhort proceſſe of our lyfe, the endles torment of hell orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for ſinners, and the perpetual pleaſures of heauen, prepared for iuſt and godly perſons.

good and euyll, ſome diſcernyng clearely, ſome darckly, accordyng to the meaſure of ingenious witt and capacitie in him that ſo deemeth and iudgeth: yet notwithſtandyng, holy Scripture cleareth a mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and conceipt, yea and helpeth reaſon perfectly to vnderſtand in what ſtate he ſtandeth: and whether in the wayes of vertue or vice he furdereth or failleth. Therefore, Dauid the Prince of Propphetes, ſayd.</p>
            <q>Declaratio ſermonum tuorum illuminat, &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectum dat paruulis</q>
            <p>And by a groſſe compariſon, though all mertalles be good in their vſe, yet is there great diſtinction of degrees among them, and diuerſity of value: as Braſſe is more of price then Iron, Tynne, better then Leade, and Copper exceedeth Tynne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and one penny of ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, is worth ten of Copper: and one penny of golde, is vvorth ſeuen of ſiluer. Euen ſo is it among Treati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Lucubracions, and matters compoſed and compi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: for they haue their diuerſitie and difference both in matter and maner of ſaying. And diuers degrees of goodnes maye bee founde in the ſame, As good, better, and all the beſt. VVherefore in behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng wel this perſwaſion, I intend neither to diſprayſe, nor yet to attribute<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſinguler prayſe ſuperfluus to any fourme of compilacion or trauell in ſpeciall.

for the ſuſtentation of their body, and take their ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and frequent recourſe in the exerciſe of readyng ſuch bokes, as ſhal make beſt for their conſolacion and profit ſpirituall. Thus in as much as holy Scripture, and the fruites thereof vvel vnderſtanded and duely execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, is a very guide to eternall lyfe, as is ſayd.</p>

            <p>And becauſe novve a dayes men are beſt delighted to heare or reade ſuch vvoorkes as are compendious, pleaſant, and profitable, ſhort in ſentence, and large in ſence. Although for lacke of cunnyng, and others ſondry impedimentes, I am inſufficient to compile ſuch a peece of vvorke, yet neuertheleſſe, by the grace of GOD, I entend to accompliſhe my beſt endeuour, accordyng to my ſclender talent, in ſetting foorth a compendius Treatis, to the honor &amp; prayſe of God, and ſpirituall profite of ſuch as ſhall take any pleaſure in readyng thereof, vvhich may be called, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templacion of ſinners. And by a ſimilitude, forſomuch as euen as a man delighted in the diuerſitie of meates and drinckes, and apparel for the body (for alteration or chaunge thereof, renueth appetite and affection) So likevvyſe the ſpirit of man reioyceth and taketh com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable refreſhing of the enterchaunge and diuerſitie of deuine matters, vvhich is the foode and furnirure of the ſoule.
