            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE Lord Marquess OF VVORCESTER, &amp;c.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>MY LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT is a common Notion, that gathers as it goes, and is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most become a vulgar Error, That Dedications in our Age, are only the effects of Flattery, a form of Complement, and no more; so that the Great, to whom they are only due, decline those Noble Patronages that were so generally al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd the Ancient Poets; since the Awful Custom has been so scandaliz'd by mistaken Addresses, and many a worthy Piece is lost for want of some Honourable Protection, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times many indifferent ones traverse the World with that advantagious Pasport only.</p>
            <p>This humble Offering, which I presume to lay at your Lordship's Feet, is of that Critical Nature, that it does not only require the Patronage of a great Title, but of a great Man too, and there is often times a vast difference between those two great Things; and amongst all the most Elevated, there are but very few in whom an illustrious Birth and equal Parts compleat the Hero; but among those, your Lordship bears the first Rank, from a just Claim, both of the Glories of your Race and Vertues. Nor need we look back into long past Ages, to bring down to ours the Magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous deeds of your Ancestors: We need no more than to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold (what we have so often done with wonder) those of the Great Duke of <hi>Beauford,</hi> your Illustrious Father, whose every single Action is a glorious and lasting President to all the future Great; whose unshaken Loyalty, and all other eminent Vertues, have rendred him to us, something more than Man, and which alone, deserving a whole Volume, wou'd be here but to lessen his Fame, to mix his Grandeurs with
<pb facs="tcp:59371:3"/>
those of any other; and while I am addressing to the Son, who is only worthy of that Noble Blood he boasts, and who gives the World a Prospect of those coming Gallantries that will Equal those of his Glorious Father; already, My Lord, all you say and do is admir'd, and every touch of your Pen re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verenc'd; the Excellency and Quickness of your Wit, is the Subject that fits the World most agreeably. For my own part, I never presume to contemplate your Lordship, but my Soul bows with a perfect Veneration to your mighty Mind; and while I have ador'd the delicate Effects of your uncommon Wit, I have wish'd for nothing more than an Opportunity of expressing my infinite Sense of it; and this Ambition, my Lord, was one Motive of my present Presumption in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicating this Farce to your Lordship.</p>
            <p>I am sensible, my Lord, how far the Word Farce might have offended some, whose Titles of Honour, a Knack in dressing, or his Art in writing a Billet Deux, had been his chiefest Talent, and who, without considering the Intent, Character, or Nature of the thing, wou'd have cry'd out up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Language, and have damn'd it (because the Persons in it did not all talk like Hero's) as too debas'd and vulgar to entertain a Man of Quality; but I am secure from this Censure, when your Lordship shall be its Judge, whose refin'd Sence, and Delicacy of Judgment, will, thro all the humble Actions and trivialness of Business, find Nature there, and that Diversion which was not meant for the Numbers, who compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend nothing beyond the Show and Buffoonry.</p>
            <p>A very barren and thin hint of the Plot I had from the Italian, and which, even as it was, was acted in <hi>France</hi> eighty odd times without intermission. 'Tis now much alter'd, and adapted to our English Theatre and Genius, who cannot find an Entertainment at so cheap a Rate as the French will, who are content with almost any Incoherences, howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver shuffled together under the Name of a Farce; which I have endeavour'd as much as the thing wou'd bear, to bring within the compass of Possibility and Nature, that I might as little impose upon the Audience as I cou'd; all the Words are wholly new, without one from the Original. 'Twas cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated for His late Majesty of Sacred Memory, that Great
<pb facs="tcp:59371:3"/>
Patron of Noble Poetry, and the Stage, for whom the Muses must for ever mourn, and whose Loss, only the Blessing of so Illustrious a Successor can ever repair; and 'tis a great Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to see that best and most useful Diversion of Mankind, whose Magnificence of old, was the most certain sign of a flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing State, now quite undone by the Misapprehension of the-Ignorant, and Mis-representings of the Envious, which evidently shows the World is improv'd in nothing but Pride Ill Nature, and affected Nicety; and the only Diversion of the Town now, is high Dispute, and publick Controversies in Taverns, Coffee-houses, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and those things which ought to be the greatest Mysteries in Religion, and so rarely the Business of Discourse, are turn'd into Ridicule, and look but like so many fanatical Stratagems to ruine the Pulpit as well as the Stage. The Defence of the first is left to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Gown, but the departing Stage can be no otherwise restor'd, but by some leading Spirits, so Generous, so Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, and so Indefatigable as that of your Lordship, whose Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronages are sufficient to support it, whose Wit and Judgment to defend it, and whose Goodness and Quality to justifie it; such Encouragement wou'd inspire the Poets with new Arts to please, and the Actors with Industry, 'Twas this that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion'd so many Admirable Plays heretofore, as <hi>Shakespear's, Fletcher's,</hi> and <hi>Johnson's,</hi> and 'twas this alone that made the Town able to keep so many Play-houses alive, who now cannot supply one. However, my Lord, I, for my part, will no longer complain, if this Piece find but favour in your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship's Eyes, and that it can be so happy to give your Lordship one hours Diversion, which is the only Honour and Fame is wish'd to crown all the Endeavours of,</p>

                     <p>Ay, this reading of Books is a pernicious thing.

               <l>Yet the pall'd Pleasure you must still purste,</l>
               <l>You give so small incouragement for new;</l>
               <l>And who wou'd drudge for such a wretched Age?</l>
               <l>Who want the Bravery, to support one Stage.</l>

               <l>And see how she her thriving Poets treats:</l>
               <l>Wisely she priz'd 'em at the noblest Rate,</l>
               <l>As necessary Ministers of State,</l>
               <l>And contributions rais'd to make 'em great.</l>
               <l>They from the publick Bank she did maintain,</l>
               <l>And freed from want, they only writ for Fame;</l>
               <l>And were as useful in a City held,</l>
               <l>As formidable Armies in the Field.</l>
               <l>They but a Conquest over Men pursu'd,</l>
               <l>While these by gentler force the Soul subdu'd.</l>
