         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is credibly recorded that one and the ſelfe ſame Citie of <hi>Ments</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> about one and the ſelfe ſame time found out and deliuered to poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie two inuentions of rare and woonderfull impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, the Print and the Gunne: the former not ſo gratefull for the exceeding good, which thereby to euery man doth or may enſue: as the latter, for the exceſſiue hurt threatned to all men is vngratious, and yet both at this day in ſuch requeſt, as it were hard to ſay whether <hi>Mars</hi> his knights more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue the one, then <hi>Mineruas</hi> ſchollers account of the other, ſo that as both haue for beginning their authors and founders, ſo for continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance they both want not their fautors and maintainers: neither is or can the priuiledge of the one be any way preiudice to the other, but either ſtands or falles in eſtimation, as ſundrie men to either are ſeuerally conceited. Leauing therefore the print to the learned, who when and where they liſt, can deliuer you in good and ſweete termes the vſe, neceſſitie, and commendation thereof: I haue cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen with mine Author to ſpeake a little of the other, or rather of the cure of ſuch deadly wounds, as by the furious breath of ſo dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous a deuiſe are procured to vs, and that not in ſmooth and curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous phraſe, or picked eloquence, the roughneſſe of the matter vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reiecting, any ſuch ſoft handling, but in blunt and rude wordes, ſuch as beſt ſute and ſort with the ſubiect it ſelfe. And here it is no part of my meaning with any curioſitie to enquire whether the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happie inuention of this churliſh engine be fetcht from the Fryar, or from the diuell, or from a ioynt councell of them both, helde by conſent in Vulcans fyery ſhoppe, I leaue that charge and the ſearch thereof to my maſters the Germaines, or to any man elſe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſeekes out of ſo boiſterous an inuention.

Theſe are the two ſortes of inconueniences, of the which by diſputation they haue agreed on, woundes by gunſhot to conſiſt, and therefore they haue ſet downe two kindes of remedies, one wherewith the partes ſo torne and wanne are holpen, that is the fleſh, ſinewes, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamentes, tendons, ioyntes and bones, and that by meanes of the bruſe, the which may come to paſſe without anie manifeſt wound at all, and of the Erccians is called <hi>Ecchymooſis,</hi> yet not without daunger, but oftentimes ſubiect to great accidentes, and manie times hath great effuſion of bloud betweene the muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, which when it is ſhed out of the vaines, preſently putrifieth; alſo great aches, which are accompanied with great fiuxe of humours, diuers ſwellinges, inflamations, and at the laſt <hi>Gangrena</hi> and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of the part affected.</p>
               <p>The other ſort which comes with a manifeſt wound is more dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeene, and the deeper and greater it is, ſo much it is thought the more dangerous, becauſe the ſhot (whether of lead or braſſe) the more vehementer it goeth in, ſo much the more it bruſeth the parts in which it entreth, by the which cauſe the bloud is congealed which falleth in the hollownes of the wounde, and filleth the orofice of the veines and hollownes of the other partes, &amp; then being deſtitute of his natur all heate (the which being quenched and mortified by the reſolution of the ſpirits, &amp; by reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the paine &amp; tearing of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny parts, it goeth againe to the ſpring heade, that is to the heart, by reaſon of the feare which is take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the deadly hurt) it becomes of a wanniſh &amp; leady colour, like to that which the common ſort cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth Aſure, the which is eaſily rotted, and eaſily doth rot the parts adioyning, and eſpecially the Spermatical: the which according to the opinion of our aunceſters, is eaſily turned to quitture: and that the eaſier and ſpeedier this fleſhe being bruſed and dead, may be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the quicke and liuely fleſh, the Chyrurgions doe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly vſe <hi>remedia ſuppu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

In this caſe the diſpoſition of the aire and heauens, is to bee conſidered, and alſo the qualitie and ſtate of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber hurted.

which are threatned by that which is ſaid before, that is to ſay <hi>Gangrena, Sphacelus</hi> and mortification of the whole members.

an Iron ſubſtance, for Iron being often quenched in that iuice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth ſo hard, that ſcarſely any man, hauing not made proofe thereof, would credite it: and on the contrarie part, it is made ſoft by often quenching thereof in the iuice of Hemlocke, ſope, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lthocke, the which alſo commeth to paſſe in tinne and leade, which being often melted and quenched in the iuice of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſea Onion, the one loſeth his crackling, the other is purged of his blackneſſe and tenderneſſe, which could not come to paſſe, except they did retaine ſome part of the ſpirit and vertue wherewith they are tempered. It is manifeſt therefore, that the mettals, although they be purged by the fire, may receiue eaſily y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſubſtance &amp; nature of other things: and meere folly it were to thinke but that a farre more eaſier mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture may be made of mettaline ſpirits, being as it were of one kinde, for we ſee Copper to bee dyed and waxe yeallowe with the ſpirit of <hi>Calemine</hi> and <hi>Tutiae,</hi> and againe to be white with the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Arſnick, Auripigment and ſuch other, whereby it may iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be concluded, if that mettals and eſpecially lead (whereof ſhot is commonly made) doth receiue a ſpirituall ſubſtance naturally of things which are of the owne kinde, of the which is made diuers mercuriall ſtincking and deadly waters, by adding to it the iuice of Libards bane<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the ſea Onion, of the Ewe tree, of the herbe Crowfoote, and alſo of the poiſon of venemous beaſtes, the which by the contrarietie of their natures to ours, doe deſtroy the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of our bodies: and by ſuch venemous mixtures, I ſay, the ſhot is ſo poiſoned, that by the onely paſſing through, it leaueth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind it plaine and manifeſt tokens of his poiſon, and that not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great daunger, if not with ſpeedie remedie it be redreſſed. For we ſee alſo by dayly experience, ſuch venemous compoſitions, that if onely the heade of an Arrow be tempered therewith, and woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a perſon, with drawing of blood, and the Arrow ſticke not, but preſently paſſeth away, yet is the poiſon ſo ſubtile and venemous that by little &amp; little creeping from the ſmaller vaines to the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſo to the principall parts, the wounded man preſently dieth. the which I haue declared, partly becauſe it was my chance often to ſee the like, (and not onely I but alſo other worthy Phiſitions, whoſe names for breuitie I let paſſe) partly that I might bring to light theſe wonderfull and prodigious effectes, which are wont to happen in this caſe: and that they might not be thought impoſſible, becauſe they are knowne of a fewe, as more at large I meane to

declare in that booke <hi>de Antidotis,</hi> which I haue in hand, and doo meane (God willing) ſhortly to publiſh, wherein I will reueale both true and meete remedies againſt ſuch poiſons: and therefore let no man doubt but that the wound may be poiſoned, through the venime of the ſhot, whether it be of leade or of any other mettall, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſome will ſay the contrarie, becauſe it was neuer their chance to be conuerſant with worthy and ſkilfull men, neither haue obſerued the ſundrie and myraculous effectes of nature (vnknowne witho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But that we may returne againe to our purpoſe, we conclude that the ſhot may be poiſoned, not by pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of it in a hole made of purpoſe, as ſome would haue it, but by often dipping and quenching them in mercuriall waters and dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly iuices, through y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which their ſubſtance may be altered &amp; ſpoiled, and ſo they doo venime and infect the wound with their euill diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, although they ſtay not in the wounde, but preſently paſſe through: of ſuch force is the ſubtiltie of them, as by experience often made in beaſts, hath ben often prooued, the which we meane to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme with probable reaſons in that booke <hi>de Antidotis,</hi> of which we ſpake off a little before. But yet we graunt that the ſhot paſſing ſo ſwiftly through the body, cannot ſo ſodenly infect with his poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: yet often it commeth to paſſe that the bullet lieth long in the wound vnknowne to the Chyrurgion: and ſo I thinke there is no man that doubteth, but that in ſuch ſpace it hath time enough to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect with his venime the hurted part, for the more ſubtiller and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall the poiſon is (as we haue declared before) ſo much ſwifter &amp; quicker are the effects thereof, by ſpreading abroade his maligne vapours, through the vaines, arteries and ſinewes, whereby it doth infect the ſpirits naturall, vitall, and animall: choaking them with a certaine diſagreeance and contrarietie, ioyning themſelues with them, whereby the life of man is extinguiſhed, the which doth conſiſt of a liuely and meete action of the ſaide three ſpirits. And theſe poiſons, the more ſubtiler and finer they be, ſo much the more daungerous they are, the which is plainly to be ſeene by the biting of Vipers and other ven<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mous waſtes. But if any man will fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly contend (as I ſee ſome will) that the ſtrength of the fire will take away all the poiſon of the bullet, I will anſwere them with the ſame argument which they themſelues are wont to vſe: for ſay they, theſe wounds are not any thing burnt at all, in that the ſhot (by reaſon of his hardneſſe) is neuer ſo hot, but that it may be
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:16614:10"/>
handled with bare hands: and likewiſe I ſay, that then the fire can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not haue ſuch power that it is able to aboliſh the poiſon which is ſpred through the ſubſtance of the bullet, ſpecially when the venime is ſo mixed with all parts of the ſhot, that it hath infected with his venime all the ſubſtance thereof. Neither am I mooued in that <hi>Ariſtotle lib. de Coelo cap.</hi> 7. writeth, that by the impulſion of the aire, the dartes or arrowes waxe ſo hot that the leade thereof melteth, the which by the thing it ſelfe and dayly experience is knowne to be falſe, and eſpecially in gun bullets, which are ſent out by fire, and are carried away farre more ſwifter then any arrowe: but if this might be graunted to <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> yet the witneſſe of aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient writers (of whom mention before is made) doth plainly proue that the poiſon therby, cannot by any means be extinguiſhed: much leſſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can it be ouercome with a far leſſer heate. Nay, I ſay, that not onely, that the venime cannot be taken away with ſo ſmal heate, but alſo I affirme, that if the bullet it ſelf ſhould be molten, yet very hardly thereby the poiſon would be purified, for ſo greatly &amp; deeply is it ſpred &amp; mingled w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the whole ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce therof, that for the moſt part there is not one part left vnaltered. Likewiſe the ſpirite of Arſnicke, <hi>Calaminae</hi> or <hi>Tuthiae,</hi> being mingled with gray or yellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Copper, dooth not at the firſt melting vaniſh away, yet we count not thoſe like to them which wee ſpake off before, ſuch as be deadly, being only outwardly &amp; farre from the principall parts ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, through their hid and ſecret qualitie, as the effectes thereof doth moſt plainly declace, By this we truſt, it is manifeſtly proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that ſhot may be poyſoned, which verie quickly will worke hys effectes, eſpecially if it ſtay in the wound: as oftentimes we haue ſeene, that poyſon being heated with a ſmall fire and ſcarſly made warme, would very hardly be quenched or taken away. By which reaſons it may be concluded y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhot may be venemous, but not tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the pouder (which we haue proued to be quite voyd of venom) but by dipping and ſeaſoning the ſhot in poyſon, which oftentimes we haue ſeene, wherefore it behoueth a wiſe and expert phiſit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And this is the very cauſe, why the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of theſe wounds poiſoned by ſhot are ſo neceſſarie (as in the Chapter before we haue taught) leaſt that the ſodaine death which many times comes thereby, be imputed to the corruption of the aire and other firſt qualities: when commonly the fault lieth in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe and vnſkilfulneſſe of the Phiſition, perſwading them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues that theſe wounds by no meanes may be venemous, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they refuſe the true kinde of healing: And ſome no doubt, will attribute it to the aboundance of blood, and to the euill iuice of the bodies called by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Greeks <hi>Cachochimia,</hi> the which two verily I doe acknowledge, &amp; with <hi>Galen</hi> confeſſe, haue great force in hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of al wounds, and the chiefeſt cauſes of euill accidences, notw<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

Therefore if the fleſh be more wanner then it is wont to be in common wounds by ſhotte, and as it were deade, with an euill colour of all the whole member, with intolorable and extraordinarie aches, and alſo with inflamation and pricking and ſhooting paines, eſpecially about the wound, with vnluſtineſſe and heauineſſe of all the whole bodie, and many times burning feuers, with ſounding and alienation of the minde: all theſe doo teſtifie that there is ſome venemous qualitie ioyned with the wound, &amp; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when there can no manifeſt cauſe be found out by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Phiſition, whereof all theſe euill accidents ſhould proceede, which ſometimes I haue ſeene to happen in ſimple wounds, yea without the tearing of any ſinewes. But more certainer ſignes of this matter may be if any tokens appeare outwardly, which may bee learned at the mouth of the patient, and by relation of his familiar friendes and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:16614:13"/>
companions: conſidering alſo the manner, the place, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon being wounded. But the ſureſt ſigne of all is learned by the bullet, if it may be found, for if you cut him in two parts, you ſhall ſee him darke and mixed with a purple and violet colour, vnlike to the colour of other ſhot being cut, which is wont to haue a yealow colour. Then maiſt thou ſurely affirme that the ſhot was poiſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, whereby the very ſubſtance thereof was altered, as plaincly is ſeene by his inward colour, which is greatly altered, wanne and darke (as we ſaid before.) Proofe thereof alſo may be made in the fire, which was ſaid (not raſhly) to haue great force in purging of all poiſon. Becauſe ſuch things which are ſtrong poiſon in deede, doe conſiſt of a ſpirituall and ayriall ſubſtance, and therefore by force of fire doe eaſily vaniſh into the aire, yet not with a ſmal heate ſuch as is felt in going out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſhot, as <hi>Ambroſius Pareus</hi> thought, which rather in proceſſe of time woulde fixe it and make it not vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latle, and ſo conſequently vnhurtfull. But by a moſt ſtrong heate of fire, ſuch as they vſe in ſubliming, for in that force of fire, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curie is eleuated and vaniſhed away: ſo likewiſe is the Arſnicke &amp; orpigment, and ſuch other ſpirits, and for that cauſe they cannot be purged, except they be preſſed in the cold necke of the ſubliming veſſels: and ſo the ſuſpected bullet being melted and kept in great heate a ſufficient time, then a darke and ſtinking ſmoke ariſeth, couering the mettall (of which ſmoke or fume you muſt heware) which after the melting is found not onely vnpurged, but alſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth blacke, wanne, and darke, which commeth through the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemous fume, ſpreding it ſelfe about the mettall, and this is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible ſigne that the ſhott was poyſoned, whereby the wound may be venomed (as I ſaid before) and that according to the time, as it remaineth in the wound. Theſe be the ſignes whereby a poyſoned wound is knowne, which are the more dangerous to be iudged, the more they doe weaken the ſtrength of the patient: Likewiſe, bli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtering, <note place="margin">Signes of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtion ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> bladdering, pricking paine, drineſſe, contraction, and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the ſkinne, doth manifeſtly ſhewe that the wound is alſo burnt with powder, the which may be learned more ſurely by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the wounded perſon, which can commonly declare whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ware wounded, nigh or farre off, which alſo may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered by the burning of the veſture: and it behoueth the Phiſition to take heede diligently of all theſe thinges, becauſe they are of great waight and may bring great hurt to the wound, and hinder

               <p>After this it behooueth to chooſe a drie and temperate aire: for <note place="margin">Of the aire.</note> ſuch is required of all wounds, becauſe by exiccation they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glutinated: but and if any man obiect, that it lieth not in our power, to bring a drie aire to the ſicke, when as there is not any thing to bee founde, more moiſter (as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> teacheth in the ſeconde chapter of his <hi>Meteors)</hi> in ſo much it exceedeth the water in moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, which in ſight ſeemeth moiſter, in that it moiſtneth things dipped therem, which the aire cannot doo by reaſon of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilneſſe therof. This may eaſily be anſwered, that ſuch aire may be choſen, and by art corrected, and ſo made meeter to our purpoſe &amp; intent: for it is not vnknowne, but that ſome places and houſes are whotter, dryer, moiſter, and colder then others be, for thoſe which be nigher the North are colde, and ſuch as are Sowtherly are whot, euen as the ſunne is nearer or farther from them. Alſo the ſituation of the country is to be conſidered, for ſome are hilly, ſome marriſh, others adioyning nigh to lakes, ſtanding pooles and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers: by the varietie whereof, the qualitie of the aire is changed and altered. Who is ignorant but that the nature of the men of <hi>Aſia</hi> is farre differing from thoſe of <hi>Europe,</hi> the which <hi>Hipoc. lib. De aere Locis etaquis)</hi> doth attribute to the change &amp; varietie of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:16614:16"/>
times, which cauſeth the nature of countries to be more rougher and harder. and that is the cauſe that countrie and ſea-coaſtes men be of an vnlike nature and diſpoſition to thoſe which are bredde in cities and vallies farre from the ſea-coaſts. What ſhal we ſay now of the ſituation of the cittie of <hi>Ferraria,</hi> or <hi>Florence,</hi> of the which in the firſt, all wounds in the head are deadly, in the other al the hurts of the legges are vncurable, for which cauſe <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> treating of this matter, ſaith that the nature of the ſouth wind is altered, by reaſon of the countries, by which it is carried, which are ſome hotter, ſome colder then ſome: for hee writeth that firſt it comes from cold and Iſie countries (whereof winds are ingendred, as <hi>Ariſtot.</hi> in the ſecond of his <hi>Meteors</hi> ſheweth, and that they are of the ſame nature at the firſt, as the Northwinds are, which are fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie and colde: as thoſe which inhabite, theſe countries doo feele:) And after being carried by the South, and beames of the ſunne waxeth ſo hot, that through the heate thereof, it looſeth his cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and burneth the herbes, and makes the inhabiters thereof to be dry, and ſo paſſing ouer the ſeas, and imbibbing the moiſture thereof, it looſeth the great dryneſſe it had receiued, and becomes moiſte, as is ſeene and perceiued in all <hi>Italy,</hi> and alſo in that part of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> which is named <hi>Occitania.</hi> And this is the reaſon why wee iudge the South-winde to bee hurtfull to woundes: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that this moiſture is ioyned with heate, which is the mother of putrifaction, as wee haue before prooued. The like may bee ſaide of the North-winde, which in ſundrie regions is verie wholſome: and withſtandeth putrifaction: and againe in ſome very unwholſome: inſomuch that the peſtilence or anie other diſeaſe raigning) is thereby increaſed. the cauſe whereof (as we ſayd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) is to be attributed to the varietie of countries: and ſituation of Cities, being in low and marriſh places, wherebyth e proper na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the windes may be altered: and ſo the bodies of men are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted and filled with all humours.

               <p>VVE ſaid in the beginning, that in wounds by ſhot, two In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications curatiue were to be conſidered, that is ſuppu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and generation of new fleſh, (which are ſufficient, if we one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly regard the contuſion and bruſing thereof, and not the venemous qualitie and burning, which may be ioyned therew<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>th) the which two intentions, that we may orderly do, and ſo obtaine our preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did purpoſe, there are eleuen indications to be conſidered of vs, which they call <hi>Subalterne,</hi> of the which one of them commandeth the ſhot to bee taken out, or ſmall peeces of the coate of maile, or points of weapons ſticking faſt, and alſo peeces of their apparell, ſcales of bones, ſharpe and pricking, clots, or any ſuch other thing which may happen in the wounde, which muſt be taken out, (if it
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:16614:20"/>
may be) without paine: and if any thing bee deepe in, it muſt bee wrought with your fingers or pincers, or toothed tenacles, made after the faſhion of a Crowes bill, as you may ſee them pictured in ſundery ſorts, in the booke of <hi>Ambroſius Pareus,</hi> a moſt ſkilfull Chyrurgion. And the ſhot muſt be taken out the ſame way it went in: placing the wounded perſon (as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> commandeth) in the ſame ſort as he was in when he receiued the wounde, or at the leaſt ſo placed and laide in his bedde, that ſo nigh as may be, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble the ſame. And the ſhot is commonly taken out by that way, as vy force it was driuen in: becauſe it hath made and prepared it ſelfe a way to come forth thereby: the which paſſage (if neede re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire) muſt be inlarged with a lancet or inciſion knife, that the bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let may follow the eaſier, and the leſſe inflamation ariſe, if ſo be it be found by a ſearcer ſticking in the fleſh, and hath not pearced any great vaine, or ſinewy place. In which caſe we muſt vſe a new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, with more profite, if the fleſh in the contrary part be verie thinne, and by feeling the ſhot is perceiued, and no manifeſt let, but inciſion may be made in the contrary ſide. And of this the Chyrur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion ought alwayes to haue a ſpeciall care (as ſaith <hi>Celſus,</hi> writing of drawing out things infixed in wounds) leaſt that a ſinew, great <note place="margin">Seuenth book of remedies, Chap. 5.</note> vaine, or artery bee hurted thereby: which if it be like to inſue, or the ſhot be ſo hidde that it cannot be founde, it is better to let it ſtay till ſuch time as nature it ſelfe ſhall expell it. For what ſhall it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, when the wound is great of it ſelfe, to make a newe, and in vaine to moleſt the patient with double paines: in ſo much as in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers the ſhot hath beene ſo ſecret, that many yeares after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wound hath bene healed, it hath fallen out of his owne accord, with a ſmall impoſtume.</p>
               <p>Moreouer this thing may be done by applying of drawing me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, whoſe vſe is dayly, eſpecially if it be ſuſpected the ſhot to be venemous, for in ſuch caſe it muſt be had out with ſpeede: wherefore (leaſt the venime ſtricke vpward, and draw to the principall parts) we muſt preſently vſe the ſtrongeſt drawers, as in other caſes thoſe not ſo forceable, of the which we ſhall haue occaſion to ſpeake, when we intreate of venemous woundes. This firſt intention being done, that is, all things (as much as in vs lieth) taken out of the wound, next we will ſpeake of ſuch medicines as firſt are to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the ſame: in which caſe we finde the iudgement of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions and Chyrurgions much to varie, ſome woulde haue a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

But how euill this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

But if meere neceſſitie, and want of other medicines, doth inforce the Chyrurgion to vſe theſe common remedies to ſtop the great fluxe of blood (which in theſe wounds is ſeldome ſeene) yet (if they may) let them bee picked out or chaunged, or els often made moiſt with <hi>Oxirhodino</hi> warmed: neither is it to be forgotten that many now adayes, do vſe to the cure of ſuch wounds (not only at the firſt dreſſing, but vntill they be fully healed) onely running wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter warmed, and ſome put therevnto vinegar and oyle, and dippe therein their matches and towe, which ſo well falleth out, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers thinke that it is done by magicall incantations: the which thing by daily experience is prooued: neither is it againſt reaſon: for <hi>Celſus</hi> writeth that ſimple cold water is profitable for woundes: <note place="margin">Lib. 8. cap. 30.</note> and in another place he ſaith, it is good how euer it be applied: yea warmed, for it eaſeth paine, expelleth inflamations, and putteth backe fluxes, the which accidents (by the conſent of all men) in the very beginning are to be reſiſted. Furthermore by the aduice of

That the wound be not long open, but ſo ſoone as may be, it be couered, and that the aire is altogether ſubiect to putrifaction, it is manifeſt to thoſe, whiche ſet anie kinde of pippins, and ſtoppe the ſame verie cloſe with <hi>lut um ſapientiae,</hi> as they tearme it, that no aire breake in,

And theſe accidents come without any manifeſt cauſe, it plainely declareth the wound to be venomed: and then (all other intentions ſaid aſide<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) preſently wee muſt prouide to withſtand that, for euen as the ſkilful ſhipmaiſter ſeeing a terrible tempeſt ariſing, with bluſtering windes, doth preſently euen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt both ſtreame and winde (conſidering his ſafegard) with ſayle and oare, ſeeke to finde ſome ſafe porte and place to ſtay in: Euen ſo the Phiſitian harniſed with reaſon, vſe, and experience, ought out of hand to applie ſome healthull medicine to this preſent incommoditie, to boate downe preſently (if it may be) the malice thereof, and that before it taketh roote and hold in the wound, and doth poſſeſſe the principall partes and heart, to which place it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth great ſpeede, and in this caſe preſent inciſion often fayleth, and that which is done too late neuer helpeth. Therfore if we iudge by the foreſaid ſignes and ſuch like that the wound is poyſoned, we muſt ſtraight haue recourſe to ſome preſent remedie, but firſt a ſound iudgement taken, with perfect prognoſtication (as <hi>Celſus</hi> willeth) giuen to the friendes of the patient, whether he be eyther

Whereunto the Phiſition or Chyrurgion ought ſo much the more to looke by, how much the more the number &amp; great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of accidents ſhall increaſe, that he may let nothing paſſe which doth pertain to the perfite <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Theſe are to be conſidered when the inciſion or fracture is manifeſt: but as concerning ſuch woundes, as haue onely a ſimple fiſſure, ſuch require a ſkilfull and expert Chyrurgion to diſcerne them: for oftentimes it is not to be percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by ſight nor handling.</p>
                  <p>The ancient in this caſe, (that is when the fracture is <hi>piloſa</hi> or <hi>Capillaris)</hi> did vſe a certaine blacke medicine, which leauing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde it a blacke ſcarre in the bone, did ſhewe the fracture to bee there.

More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer you muſt take great heede in all wounds of the head that they take no moiſture, as <hi>Hipoc.</hi> witneſſeth <hi>de vuln cap.</hi> But contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe, let ſuch things as dry and comfort the head be applied either drie or in powder, or mixed with mell roſate. Such as comfort the head are theſe: the roots of both <hi>Ariſtolochies,</hi> franke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſence, myrrh, ireos, panax, <hi>farina, orobi,</hi> and other ſuch like: alſo mercurie preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate is very good, mixed with mel roſat, &amp; ruineth the ſuperflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of bones: but if the riſing perce through, then muſt it bee tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pined before the third day, or by ſome other meanes an iſſue made, (as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaith) which muſt be ſo ample, that inflamation be ſtaide, and a paſſage for the matter made, ſo that throughly it

may be taken away and clenſed, which muſt be done circumſpectly, and with fit and meete inſtruments, which are liuely ſet out by <hi>Ambroſius Pareus</hi> in the Chapter of woundes of the heade. And this handie worke being ended, wee muſt diligently marke when the broken bone doth waxe loſe, for then it is to be taken out, ſo be it ſticketh not faſt to the panicle, which if it doth, it muſt not bee medled with, leaſt thereby you hurt the panicle or hinder it by let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in of the aire: but you muſt ſtay till ſuch time as the bone fall away of his owne accord, but if the bone be quite ſeparated from the ſkinne, which oftentimes happeneth in ſuch wounds, through the great force of the ſhotte: and there is alſo inflamations, and other davngerous accidents which commonly accompany theſe wounds. Then it muſt preſently be opened, yea before it doe rot, if ſo the Chyrurgion be come in time, which ought to bee both dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and ſkilfull, and hath a perfite knowledge of all ſuch places as may be trapaned, in that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſeams of <hi>Crainon,</hi> are not to be medled with, but if the wound chance to happen there, then it muſt be tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paned on both ſides, not touching the ſeames, and it muſt be done in that part which ſhall ſeeme moſt conuenient, to auoide the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. Moreouer you muſt beware that you trapan not the brows or lower parts of the braine, leaſt thereby (the way being made open) the braine by reaſon of his heauineſſe iſſue out, neither yet about the temples, becauſe of the muſcle, and vitall inſtruments which are there: which thing <hi>Galen</hi> hath obſerued <hi>li.</hi> 6. <hi>ca.</hi> 6. <hi>meth.</hi> with theſe wordes: <hi>Cogitaui preterea accidere poſſe, vt ſi a latere magnum fierit in oſsibus foramen, promineret fortaſsis hac parte cerebrum.

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:16614:34"/>
the beginning of this chapter. To which purpoſe the Chyrurgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſet downe two intentions, whereof the one reſpecteth the rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and willeth as nigh as may bee, that all the broken bones be reduced to their naturall ſeates, which being done, ſhe commandeth the whole ioynt to be rowled and preſſed with linnen clothes, wet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted firſt in ſome conuenient liquor to keepe backe all accidentes, the which ſome allowe at the firſt dreſſing, that the vnetion may be the ſurer, and woulde not haue it quite vndone, till fortie dayes be expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, but to loſe it, and binde it harder, in the meane ſpace, as neede ſhall require, except it be through intollerable itching, inflamation, paine, or ſuch like: and to remedie ſuche, they preſcribe an orderly dyet, or bloudletting, or operation, or ſuche locall medicines, as ſhalbe thought meete.</p>
               <p>The other intention reſpecteth the wound, and forbiddeth that it be hid and rowled ſo faſt, as is vſed in fractures, in that it requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to be dreſſed oft, that the filth and excrementes whiche nature expelleth may haue iſſue, and for that cauſe ſome vſe ſtraightwayes <hi>ſetones</hi> (as they tearme them) if it may eaſily bee put in the wound, which they annoint firſt with meete medicines: And ſome vſe one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tentes, and if neede require, they alſo amplifie and inlarge the orifice thereof, and likewiſe the lower partes, whereby all filth and baggage may iſſue out the better, and ſo the parts are broughtin a better caſe, &amp; eaſier to be cured, Likewiſe they dayly diminiſh their tents, making them ſhorter &amp; ſhorter, whereby y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wound may heale the better and incarnate the faſter, to which purpoſe they vſe medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines meete for wounds by ſhot, of which we made relation in the former treatiſe. Moreouer to finiſh this laſt intention, they haue a great regard to charge the patient to vſe meates that are iuicy and good, and ſuch as conglutinate, till ſuch time as <hi>Callus</hi> is growne, and chiefly becauſe the nature of thoſe woundes is ſuche, that they ſeeme to tarie for the conſolidation of the bones. This maner of curing is vſed nowe adayes of diuers Chyrurgions, when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bones are fractured, whoſe iudgement I could not but highly commend (becauſe they haue of their ſides, the opinion of moſte excellent men, which haue and doe vſe the ſame maner of curiyng) were it not that the thing it ſelfe, and alſo experience did plainely teache me, and as it were ſet before my eyes, the innumerable inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, which happen through theſe ſplintes, and hard binding, for they oftentimes bring accidentes, as paine, inflamation, and <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grena,</hi>

Nowe in my iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I thinke it beſt, that the bones by and by before inflamation be ingendred, be brought in their ſeate and naturall forme, with as little paine as may be to the patient, and then to vſe ſuch medicines, as are profitable to both inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ctions that is, for the wound &amp; fracture, and becauſe I haue ſeene the verie ſame order vſed of moſt learned and ſkilfull Phiſitions, being of mine acquaintance, aſwel in Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many as in diuers other places. I thought it not good to paſſe ouer this order, whiche they are woont to holde and followe in curing wounds with fracture, eſpecially becauſe I iudge y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> it is moſt meet for woundes by ſhotte, in that they diſcommend this common and hard ligaturs or binding, for no other cauſe, but for the paine, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamations, and <hi>Gangrena,</hi> whiche commonly comes thereby, whereunto thoſe woundes by ſho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

well done, but what hee doth himſelfe, which thing, as it may be ſeene in many other arts, yet moſt ſpecially in this, which is called y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> 
                     <hi>Spagericke</hi> arte. For we ſee euery where certame men, I knowe not what they be, puffed vp with a certaine barbarous and fooliſhe pride, which with great ſcorne inuey againſt thoſe medicines which are drawne out of the mettaline mines: Which notwithſtanding, it is apparant were in vſe and had in great eſtimation with the chiefe antient Phiſitions, as we haue declared in that booke which we haue ſet forth of the ſpagiricke preparation of medicines. And what I pray you is the cauſe of this anger, or rather madneſſe: but that (as they themſelues confeſſe) they knowe not the preparation of them. O happie artes, if onely artificers might iudge them, (as <hi>Fabius</hi> is reported ſometime to haue ſaid.) Then are they vnhappy of whome the ignorant and vnlearned feare not ſo raſhly to giue iudgement, which neuer yet vnderſtoode from whence, or why, this is called the Spagiricke arte whiche learned men of two Greeke wordes haue ſo named, becauſe by that arte, a certaine ſubtill and ſpirituall nature is drawne, gathered and preſſed out, wherein the force and effect of the medicine doth chiefly confiſt. The great and incomparable commoditie whereof as it appeareth in many other diſeaſes, ſo ſhall it chiefly be knowne in curing woundes by Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot. As I truſt (God willing) it ſhall much more happily be tryed and found out by the preparations of medicines animall, vegetable, and minerall, and by other eſſences drawne out of mercurie, <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>itrioll, arſenicke, Iron, Copper, Lead,</hi> and <hi>Litarge,</hi> and alſo out of <hi>Antimony</hi> and ſuch other mineralles, as alſo out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> groſe and fattie bodies of ſimple mettals: of whome it is farre off, that the force ſhould be ſo great, although the antient Phiſitions haue vſed them to cure woundes, and vlcers, (as their writinges doe te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie) as the force of their ſpirites, which may be called, as it were their ſoules. But (peraduenture ſome of thoſe backebiters wil ſay) why are not we content with thoſe medicines which the learned antiquitie hath deliuered vnto vs, and that <hi>Hypocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi> the antient pillers of our arte and others haue ſet forth in theyr mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numentes: Why doe we ſeeke new wayes neuer heard of before, ſpecially vnknowne to the Apothecaryes: But ſome of vs will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, that the only remedie of <hi>Mercurie</hi> precipitate, is the onelie remedie (to paſſe ouer other) which verie lately they haue begun to vſe, in curing of woundes by Gunſhot and other maligne v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

were ſufficient to aunſwere this their queſtion, yea and to reproue their follie ioyned with intoller able pride. But if authoritie be aſked for, I thinke <hi>Geſner, Guinter, Andernacke, Seuerine</hi> (to paſſe ouer a great many other) wil be for vs as great authoritie w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the learned: as theſe ſlanderers. Specially becauſe the learning of theſe famous men is ſo confirmed by their learned writinges and monumentes, that thoſe toonges might count it a greater honoue vnto them to confeſſe themſelues their ſchollers. It were eaſie for me to bring forth many other argumentes, if I did not ſee the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie of theſe backbiters to be ſo great, wherof truely I am aſhamed, ſpecially when I behold ſome of their books lately ſet forth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, contrarie to the purpoſe of the treatiſe, ſtrange thinges are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>farced, that (as the olde prouerbe ſaith) the oyntment ſeemeth to conſiſt in nothing: as though they pertained to the purpoſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating of curing the gout, certain inuectiue digreſſions I know not what, of the beginning of thinges, of the originall of mettals &amp; Philoſophers ſtone (which of them is called <hi>Moroſophocus)</hi> or did in any other poynt ſeeme to agree with it. Therefore againe and againe I am inforced to crie out. O happie artes if onely arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers might iudge of them. How farre vnlike was the purpoſe of many old men, the which if they were ignorant of any thing, which they vnderſtood, was knowne of other, euen in farre diſtant coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, they ſpared no labour to goe ſee them. <hi>Plato</hi> inflamed with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to learne thoſe thinges, which he knew not, went into Egypt, and after to Tarentum to Architas, and ouer all Italie to heare the other Pythagoricall Philoſophers, <hi>Appollonius Tyanius</hi> tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed through the kingdome of Perſia, and paſſed ouer the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Caucaſus,</hi> and viſited the Albanes, <hi>Scythians, Maſſagetes,</hi> and all the rich kingdomes of India. Afterwardes was caried vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Brachmanes, and heard <hi>Iarchus</hi> in his chaire of gold diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the hidden cauſes of thinges, and of the hidden miſteries of nature. From thence by the Elanutes, Babylonians, Chaldees, Meedes, Aſſirians, Arabians, and Paleſtines, he returned to Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria, and from thence went into Ethiopia to heare the Gymnoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtes, and to learne their ſecret and hidden artes. This vertue is truely to be followed, and not the ſluggiſhneſſe of thoſe ſlothfull followers, which hauing ſearſe once moued their foote from their countrie fires, yet will diſalowe this Spagericke arte, and thinke <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
