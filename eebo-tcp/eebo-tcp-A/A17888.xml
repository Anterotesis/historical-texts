            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

farre beyond our reach and capacity, as the Heauen is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from the earth: And if the thoughtes of our imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions be ſo different, ſithens in that which you now propoſe vnto me, the opinion which I conſtantly imbrace of you is ſo far different from your owne, and that which you tearme Gods Iuſtice, Rigour, and abondoning of you, I conſider as Gods Grace, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity, Bounty and Mercy to your ſoule. O my deareſt THEOPIST, if you knew the gift of God, * his hand which now ſeemes ſo heauy vnto you, would appeare light; and you would perceaue that that ſweete and fauorable hand,

If you will beleeue me, you shall not onelie find God's aſſiſtance in your tribulation, but as the text of the Pſalmiſt ſaith in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe tearmes, you shal draw it from the verie tribulation *.

               <p>LOe here a pill which I aſſure my ſelfe will ſeeme to you a litle too rigorous, and bitter, but if you haue but the hart and ſtomake to take it downe, I dare pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe my ſelfe, you will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue a ſpeedie and wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derfull effect in it, and be notably comforted therby. Marrie you muſt take it downe without chewing it; you muſt shut your eyes when you take this potion. Shall I tell you in a
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:7921:88"/>
word what this ſo ſoueraigne an Antidote is? it is contempt. I, contempt, THEOPISTE, for ſince your ſpirituall Directour hath ſo often told you (found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the botome of your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, while you reueale your cauſe vnto him, * and lay open vnto him the windings of your hart) that in all thoſe thoughtes which ſeemed ſo horrible vnto you, there was more paine then faulte, if you deſire to free your ſelfe from the formar, as by Gods grace you are from the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, nothing can with more faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie or expedition deliuer you from it, then the contempt of thoſe ſuggeſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the diuell. For be the diuell as ſrtong as
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:7921:89"/>
he will (and IOB aſſures vs that there is no earthly power in any ſort to be compared to his) yet ſince our Sauiour IE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SVS CHRIST bound him, he is able to ouercome none but ſuch as deliuer vp their weapons into his hands, as S. AVGVSTINE in one of his Sermons doth teach vs, and like to a maſtiue, he can onely bite ſuch as of their owne free accorde put them ſelues into his mouth, though indeed he haue libertie to barke at all the world. Let him cry then, let him knocke, beate, ſnarle, keepe a coyle at the gate of our hart: vnleſſe our conſent open him the doore, he can neuer enter. And herevpon
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:7921:89"/>
they are conuinced of impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence who permitt one to come in to them, whom they know for a theife, and one that comes to robbe them. He that knowes, ſaith S. LAV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RENCE IVSTINIAN, that the wine which is preſented vnto him is impoyſoned, is he not deuoyd of all reaſon, if with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all compulſion he drinke it? But marke the ſleight: The diuell imitates the fisherman, who coueres the pointe of his hooke with a baite, to th'end that the greedie fish may ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it downe, without per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauing the ambush which is layd to catch him. He reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles the Serpents, wherof the Prophete maketh mention,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:7921:90"/>
which vnder the faire dugges they shewe, hide a venimous, milke, which they freely communicate to any that will ſucke it. But be the venime of temptation as neere vnto vs as it will, yet can it neuer hurt vs, vnleſſe it be ioyned vnto the free and deliberate co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent of our will, according to that infallible Maxime, that no man doth hurt, or is hurt but by himſelfe. The diuell may beate the ſteele as long as he liſt, and by temptation, may beate ſparkles of fire vpon our hart, yet if he want the match of our conſent, he shall neuer be able to ſett our inward houſe on fire. Though the temptation should continew
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:7921:90"/>
all the dayes of our life, ſaith our B. F. in his Philophee, yet shall it neuer defile vs with ſinne: yea, I adde, that if we fight valiantly, it ſerues for matter to many crownes. But call you that fighting valie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly, will you reply, to contemne the charge the enemy makes vpon vs? yes, THEOPISTE, it is in my opinion one of the greateſt feates of vallour. For contempt of the enemy is a ſigne of aſſurance, and the firſt ſteppe to victorie, is to be confident of it. Thoſe that are doubtfull and diſamayed, in, or before the Combate, come hardly euer happily off. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the aduantage which Goliath had in great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:7921:91"/>
yet the litle DAVID being confident in God, doth deſpiſe his brauadoes, and hopes as well to ſee an end of him, as of the Lions &amp; Beares which formarly he had ſlayne. And againe, I will diſcouer vnto you a ſtratageme t'is this. The diuell, though feeble, and damned to the deepe pitt of Hell, yet comes not an inch short of his auncient pride, but eſteemes himſelfe as ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g &amp; powerfull as he was, when he made the reuoult againſt his Creatour, and ſtroue to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come like to the Higheſt, ſo that he can in no wiſe endure to be deſpiſed, but flyes from thoſe that fight with that weapon, as from ſuch as aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulte
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:7921:91"/>
him vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that ſide where he is the weakeſt, and where (as did ELEAZAR, who ſtrucke the Elephant of Antiochus in the flancke) one may eaſely reach him a deepe and deadly blow. And that the thing goes as I deliuer it you, frame a iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t by our Sauiours temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in the deſert: As long as our Sauiour daigned to make him anſwere, meaſuring, as it were, his owne greatnes with his aduerſaries force, he dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles his blowes, and waxeth hotter in the fight: but as ſoone as theſe words of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, <hi>begone Satan,</hi> procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded out of the Redeemours mouth as thunder and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; he ſlid away with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:7921:92"/>
and shame, and shortly forſooke the feild. Further, what reaſon haue you, THEO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PISTE, to treate thoſe impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune thoughtes which moleſt and toyle you, otherwiſe, then in termes of contempt. Eagles you know, according to the old Prouerbe, diſdayne to flie at Flies. And he that would imploy his beſt endeuours, &amp; put himſelfe into a ſweate, to driue away, and keepe thoſe litle troubleſome creatures off his face, would more moue his ſpectatours to laughter then to pittie. Such, doubtleſſe, is the vnprofitable, I will not ſay, the ridiculous imployme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of many, who by continuall clamours and complaintes,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:7921:92"/>
and if I might ſo ſay, by force of armes, thinke to driue away their euil thoughtes, vttering now and then ſuch ſtrange ſpeaches, and making ſuch mouthes and faces, that ſuch as ſee and know their deſeaſe, doe rather mocke then pittie them. In this pointe they are not altogether vnlike to that old Emperour, who shutt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe vp in his Chamber, and exerciſed himſelf in catching flyes, while it was conceaued that he was imployed in more ſerious affaires. Let, therfor, THEOPISTE, thoſe curres bawle at you, without euer ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king notice of their barking, and you shall ſee, they will hold their peace. If you irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:7921:93"/>
them, they will barke and bawle lowder. Giue thoſe crowes leaue to croake, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out driueing at them with clodds &amp; ſtowes, as an au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cient Poete ſpeakes. Imitate him, who in the Sommer tyme walkes in a duſtie way, where the winde makes the duſt riſe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnder his feete. He shutts his eyes: holds on his way, without troubling himſelfe with the allaying of all this duſt: otherwiſe, it were to follow &amp; fight with his owne shadowe, and feyned fanto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes: to ſtriue to meaſure the ayre, and waigh the fire. * An endeuour as fruitleſſe as foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish. Follow ALEXANDER'S way, who with one twarte
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:7921:93"/>
blow cutt the Gordian knotte which he could not looſe: ſo by a powrefull diſdayne you shall more eaſely deliuer your ſelfe out of the ſnares and netts which the enemy hath ſet to catch you, then euer you can diſengage your ſelfe by a violent winding and turning. S. IOHN CLIMACVS brings in to this pourpoſe, the ſtorie of an old Munke, who for many yeares together hauing bene tempted with blaſphemie, and endured incredible panges in this tryall, he diſcouered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to a neighbouring Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite to haue ſome cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſell and conſolation from him: He had no other, then that which I preſcribe vnto you, that is, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutly
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:7921:94"/>
to contemne all his il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. In the interim, the Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite who was a beaten and experienced ſouldier in that kind of warre, tooke vpon him all the ſinnes which the tempted perſon apprehended he had commit; wherevpon he receaued ſuch conſolation, that vpon the firſt acte of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt which he made accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to counſell, the diuell forſooke him quite, nor was he afterwards diſquieted with the like thoughtes.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II.</head>
               <p>BVt if the terrour which doth poſſeſſe you (and which I would tearme vaine, if I did not know that euen ſeruile feare is a grace of God) doth not permit you to contemne an enemy which you dreade, &amp; whoſe aſſaultes are ſo terrible vnto you, make this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideration a rampire to your breaches, and like vnto the fabulous Giant, let your ouerthrowe redouble your forces, repreſenting vnto your
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:7921:95"/>
mynd that that which fightes againſt vertue, defeates it not, yea, that oppoſition contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes force and groth vnto it. Why, would you euer fall into that opinion as to thinke, that the vertue of Chaſtitie should conſiſte in being wholy vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible, like vnto a ſtone or a blocke. I cannot perſuade my ſelfe that your iudgement can giue credit to a thought ſo abſurde. In what then doth this faire vertue conſiſte? doe not you ſee that it conſiſtes in a perfect reſiſtance of all that is contrarie to puritie: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon it is compared to the white and daintie Lilie, which growes amidſt the blacke and rough thornes? Doe you not
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:7921:95"/>
ſee, that Gardiners fetch pinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, ſweete Marierome, and other odoriferous flowres, out of ſtincking dung hills. Roſes doe ſmell far more fragrantly being ſett neere vnto the ſtrong ſauered garlike. We muſt make the like conceipt of Faith, nothing doth driue it fo farre in, nor imprint it more deeply in our hart, then the temptations of blaſphemie and infidelitie: For as fire is neuer ſo hote, as when it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding cold, ſo is our Faith neuer ſo cloſely vnited vnto God, as when it is violently oppoſed. We reſemble sheepe who run all cloſe together on a heape, and make towards their shepheard, as ſoone as
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:7921:96"/>
they perceaue the wolfe draw neere: for as ſoone as we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend that the enemy goes about to bereaue vs of the precious treaſure of our Faith, which is the grownd of our eternall ſaluation, we caſt our ſelues into the lappe, or bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of the Prince of Good Paſtours, and the Bishope of our ſoules. * This moued S. LEO to ſay, that without temptation vertue cannot be reduced into Act. For there is no Faith without trouble, and agitation; No Charitie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſting of ſenſualitie; no fight without an aduerſarie; no victorie without fight; nor crowne without victorie. This is a thing of great conſolation,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:7921:96"/>
if you can well vnderſtand and Practiſe it, THEOPISTE: For thence you may learne to make progreſſe in vertue, by meanes of that verie thing which ſeemes oppoſite vnto it, ſince it is true, according to the doctrine of S. BONAVEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TVRE, that by the reſiſtance which we make againſt temp<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tation, we make a great ſteppe in the vertue wherin it ſtriues to hinder vs. This is manifeſt in S. BENNET, S. FRANCIS, S. THOMAS OF AQVINE, whom God voutſafed to fauour with the gift of a perfect Continen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie &amp; puritie, for that they had by heroicall Actes ſubdued motions contrarie to honeſtie. The like happens, ſaith the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:7921:97"/>
ſame Doctour, to thoſe that are te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted in matter of Faith: for if they behaue themſelues like the braue Souldiers of IE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SVS CHRIST, * the end of their Combat is alwayes accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paigned with extraordinarie lightes and notions, which are, as certaine rewards of their fidelitie. So doth light riſe and increaſe to the iuſt, * and in the midſt of the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, a ſple<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dour doth shine to thoſe that are of a right hart. * In this ſort Patience did dilate it ſelfe in IOB'S hart, (wherof he is a perfect paterne): and in ſequall therof, the goods, which by the Diuine permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, were take from him by a violent hand, were reſtored
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:7921:97"/>
him to the double. Iudge your ſelfe then, THEOPISTE, whether I had not great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to tell you aboue, that you did reiect your owne good, when you begged to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered of temptation. Your ſicke hart doth loath this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull manna: and your crayſie iudgement, makes litle eſteeme of the wishfull Land of Promis, which God makes flowe with the honie and milke of his benedictions.</p>

               <p>ABOVE all things, THEOPISTE, be ware that this affliction of mynd which doth croſſe you, doe not delay you, as an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune <hi>Remora,</hi> in the courſe of your nauigation, that is, in the exerciſes of your voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For as the Crampe-fish, hauing take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> downe the fishers baite, ſends out by the line, ſuch a mu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>neſſe into his arme, that he is forced to lett all goe:
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:7921:106"/>
ſo the Angell of darknes, who ſtriues ſtill, as the Prouerbe goes, to fish in troubled wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, perceauing him ſelfe not able to ſtaggar a ſoule by temptation, takes pleaſure at leaſt, to put him out of the racke or path of his dutie, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting woode on his breade, * as well as ſnares in his way, * that he may forget to eate that, or at leaſt ſtumble at this. He thinkes he gaynes not a litle, when he delayes vs, if not to doe what is good, at leaſt to doe it well. It is a great ſteppe to victorie, to haue diſrancked the enemyes troopes. He will at leaſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coaſte and incumber vs, if he cannot retire and make vs
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:7921:106"/>
returne backewards. For the guilefull villaine knowes full well, that not to aduance in the way of God, is to recoyle; and that vpon IACOB'S ladder, all aſcend or deſcend, none ſtay lingering vpon it. He ſtriues to ſtope the mouth of our Canon, if he cannot carie it away. He is content to make our defence vnprofitable. He will preſently after make a new charge vpon vs; and will haue an eaſie victorie ouer vs, if he find vs diſarm'd and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſordered. Wherfore I doe verie earneſtly exhort you, THEOPISTE, that, (be your penſiueneſſe, apprehenſion, dolour &amp; diſtreſſe, which this temptation brings vpon you,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:7921:107"/>
neuer ſo great) you growe not ſlacke and careleſſe in any of your ſpirituall exerciſes, or any exteriour imployme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertayning to your ſtate and condition. In this you will not onely giue a laudable teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of your courage and skill, but euen of your loue and loyaltie towards God, shewing that the waters of annoyes cannot extinguish, nor the torrents of water beare away that heauenly flame, * It is an eaſie taske for the leaſt of mortalls to ſteere the shippe in faire and calme weather: but in rough ſtormes, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Pilote, hath his hands full to guide the ſterne. This law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full imployment will worke
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:7921:107"/>
two good effectes in you at once; for it will fruſtrate your aduerſarie in his plott, which was to withdraw you from your ordinarie courſe &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, in the functions and actions of the vocation to which God hath called you: and it will withall ſerue to diuerte your mynd, that the griefe which doth afflict, may not ſeeme ſo ſenſible vnto you. I will adde a third aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage: It is, that as flies doe not ſitt vpon runing waters, nor can find good footing vpon a ſmooth glaſſe: ſo doth te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion gett but ſmale footing in a ſoule that is well imployed, and who flies idleneſſe.

If you will beleeue me, THEO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PISTE, in lieu of looſing cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, you shall renew your feruour, calling to mynd your
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:7921:109"/>
firſt Charitie. * You shall imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate thoſe ſicke men, who eate rather by reaſon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> appetite, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſerue their ſtrength, and more vigourouſly ſuſtayne the deſeaſe that hanges vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. In the end, ſaith DAVID, the patience of the poore doth not perish. Be ware that the heate of this temptation put you not out of your way; runne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out intermiſſion for the prize which is propoſed vnto you, but runne ſo that you may beare it away. * Follow not that vnfortunate Hermes-fire of your ſuggeſtion, which will ſeduce and miſleade you: Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the faithfull dogge which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually followes his maſter, giuing no eare to their hola's
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:7921:110"/>
and cryes who meete him on the way. In a word keepe your ſelfe ſtill in action, and the enemye will not know how to catch you. The ſerpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of temptations, and the pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiueneſſe which doth accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paignie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, reſemble ſerpents and toades, which deſire ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to liue in ſtanding and ſtinking pooles, then in cleare and running riuers.

So in the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bate in which you now fight, double your exerciſes of pietie, giue your ſelfe more frequently to
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:7921:110"/>
Prayer, to workes of mercy, to reading ſpirituall bookes, to mortifications; goe more often to the Sacraments of Pennance, and the holy Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſte. And although you be forced to practiſe all theſe things without guſte, without feeling, and as you conceaue, without feruour; yea euen with auerſion, repugnance, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tradiction, loathſomeneſſe, and a certaine violence of mynd, yet omitt not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinew them: for as the moſt renowmed vallour doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in the greateſt dangers; ſo the moſt generous fidelitie, doth shew itſelfe in thoſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, no otherwiſe then the ſtrongeſt wine doth grow
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:7921:111"/>
in the moſt rockie ground, and ſuch as are moſt expoſed to the heate of the Sunne at moonetyde. But how is it poſſible, will you ſay, that I should produce ſo ferme actes of Faith, while I hardly thinke I haue any faith at all? No, THEOPISTE, no, you are not depriued of Faith. A man in a ſwoone is not deade. His hart beates ſtill, though his poulſe be verie weake and ſlowe. Vnder a great heape of hote ashes, ther is yet ſome hot coale, and ſo much the more hote, as it is more cloſely co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered. Fire that is shut vp in an Ouen is far more actiue, then that which flies in the open aire. The water of the

And is it not written, that out of the bellie of him that shall beleeue, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing waters shall flowe, * and waters that shall runne to life euerlaſtinge. * And if you deſire to be further inſtructed in the practiſe which I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe vnto you, I referre you to our B.

is with me as a valiant Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion, and thereby all thoſe that doe perſequute me, &amp; doe riſe vp againſt me shall be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated and confounded. * O God, ſaid DAVID, place me neere vnto thee, and then let them fight who liſt againſt me. * If thou be with me, ſaith the diuine Apoſtle, who can be againſt me? * Now as ſtarrs doe not onelie looke downe vpon the earth, but alſo doe dart downe vpon it diuerſe influences; ſo the eyes of God are not meerely caſt vpon vs, as IOB ſaith, as one man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds another; but, as the ſcripture doth teach vs, they doe infuſe a certaine force in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs * which makes vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come

And this being ſaid, I haue no more to ſay vnto you, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to leaue you in the hands of God almightie, and with MOYSES, to the kiſſe of our Lord. * You are alreadie, ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently inſtructed in ſpirituall affaires, to diſcerne the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt Meditation and Contemplation: yet to renew in you the memorie therof, you may pleaſe to looke what our B.

It is a ſimple, ſingular, and louely looke, caſt vpon any Truth or Miſterie; yet a looke, which in its one onely ſimple, and naked Act, doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend in emine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie, vertue, and ſubſtance, all that great varietie of Actes, which Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation doth produce: This, doth exerciſe the Powers di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly and ſeparately: that doth vnite and gather them together into one pointe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth them to that vnitie, which is held ſo famous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Miſticall Diuines: to that one neceſſarie thing, * prayſed by our Sauiours owne mouth: to that one ey, * to that onely haire, which doth wound the Spouſe his hart.

An act ſo excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that it may be tearmed the quinteſſence of all ſpirituall extractions. An act, which, like as the herbe Dodecatheon, conteynes in it ſelfe the vertue of all the other ſimples, ſo it comprehends all the force and vigour of all the other Actes, which the ſoule is able to produce in the life called Actiue. It is a knowen thing, that Empirikes by meanes of fire, are accuſtomed to draw all the eſſence of the medcines which they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poſe into a litle water or powder, ſo that by litle things in appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, they worke wonderfull effectes.

               <p>BVT euery one, will you ſay, is not capable of CONTEMPLATION; the very word doth affright you, THEOPISTE, becauſe it is not ſo common as MEDITATION; yet I can aſſure you, the thing it ſelfe is far more facile more familiar, and more vſuall then you imagine. Yes, THEO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PISTE, for doe you not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme it an eaſier thing, to behold ſimply, that is, with a ſimple and interiour looke,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:7921:121"/>
ſome Truth, or myſterie, then to thinke of it; and againe, to thinke of it ſimply, more facile then to frame a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of diſcourſes vpon it; ſo many actes of the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, Will, Memory, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludes, Pointes, Affections, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, Thankeſ giuings, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blations, demands, Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Inuocations, Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Place, Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, with all that great and comberſome traine, whereof the inſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s for Meditation are full: for before you can beate all this into a groſſe or shalowe braine, you shall ſpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d many a faire yeare, and often times, after a greate deale of paines taken, you preuayle

nothing but weary his braine, and breede in him a diſguſt of deuotion, that I may ſay no worſe. I ſay not this, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauing theſe precepts not to be good, and all theſe Actes profitable, proper, neceſſary, eſpecially to beginers in ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall life; for who knowes not, that meditatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner, and as it were, the <hi>Aurora</hi> of the light day of Contemplation; and in ſome ſort a neceſſary meanes, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the courſe of nature?

Eleuations, affections Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſtifeled with the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity, know not which to take or ſticke to: and making a number of good pourpoſes, they performe none at all.

One affection or two well chewed well taſted; one or two reſolutions well en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauen, deepely imprinted vpon the ſoule, In my opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, make a man come from his meditations, better diſpoſed, and more reſolute to doe well, then when the mynd knowes not at which end to begin to put in execution thoſe pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, which it rather beheld ſuperficially as in a confuſed heape, then perfectly relish.
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:7921:123"/>
The Archer that beholds many markes at once, rarely hits any. But here is not the place wherein I am to enlarge my ſelfe vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this point, which I haue already done, in a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection which I made and published touching mentall Prayer. I will onely make vſe of this digreſſion to proue what I haue vndertaken, to wit, that it is eaſier to Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate, then to meditate; &amp; that more doe conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plate, (though they reflect not of it) then doe meditate, as we ſee by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience. Tell ſome ſimple and vulgare perſon, that God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for our ſake, or ſome other Article of the Creede, he will beleeue it ſimply, and
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:7921:124"/>
humbly and ſweetly will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace and aſſent to that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of our Faith. Goe when you haue done this, &amp; make him make a Meditation vpon it, according to the long me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodes which many Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours deliuer. Let's, for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, vpon Chriſtmas day, tell a ſoule that beleeues ſimply, and adores IESVS borne of the bleſſed Virgin, that she should place her ſelfe in the preſence of the litle IESVS; that she should frame in her ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger of Bethlo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> together with the oxe, the Aſſe, haye, ſtraw, the Bleſſed Virgin, S.

weather, the child quaking with cold, lying all along vpon the litter, ſwadled in poore cloutes, adored by his holy mother, his foſter-father, the Angels Paſtours &amp;c. Tell her further, that she is to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke the diuine grace, to make her preludes, her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratory prayers. From the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, make her paſſe on to her three points of Conſideration. Shew her how she is to amplifie and enlarge her reaſons and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, by looking vpon, waighing and examining all; the cauſes, the effectes, the time, place, perſons, all the circumſtances, actions, words, &amp;c. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> teache her, how she is to moue herſelfe to good af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:7921:125"/>
out of her diſcourſe and reaſoning, affections of all ſorts of loue; Compaſſion, Feare, Ioy, Greife, Mercy Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punction, &amp;c. Inſtruct her how out of theſe affections she is to forme Reſolutions. Yet further, giue her a modell of thankeſgiuing, vnions and the reſt. In fine ſpeake to her touching attentions, Actuall, habituall, vertuall: of diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, of want of guſte, of lightes, viſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, with a number of other tearmes. Doe you not plainely diſcouer that in ſteede of giuing her the wings of a doue to fly, you lay a loade vpon her, vnder which she is not able to ſturre, while she knowes not at what end
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:7921:125"/>
to begin a worke ſo confuſed. So that hauing at once more to doe then she is able, she doth leſſe then she ought. But if omitting all this, you would moue her to beleeue in ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie of hart, that IESVS CHRIST was borne of the virgine MARIE, * (as we haue in our Creede) hauing, as she hath the habit of Faith, this ſimple Act is eaſie vnto her. Wish her to loue him who by this his birth gaue himſelfe vnto her, * and in himſelfe, whom he gaue without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue; all things, * you will find her moued, with this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of Charitie, * freely to offer vp her ſelfe to him, and perceaue her to be, as it were,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:7921:126"/>
in the verie ſame diſpoſition, which cauſed the Diuine A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle to ſay, I liue in the Faith of IESVS CHRIST; who hath loued me euen vnto death, and the death of the Croſſe. * Now, in your aduiſe, is not this ſimple and louing aſpect a kind of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>templation, ſince it is made without diſcourſe, and without that multiplicitie of Actes, or rather agitations of the vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, and will? Hence it is, that ſimple perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s are ſometymes more capable of deuotion, then curious, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiue, reſlecting, and pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating witts, who make a great deale more brute, but yeald leſſe fruit. Endeuour far more, yet performe leſſe. Who
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:7921:126"/>
thinke you, hath more frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sunne, the Ruſtike who hath a cleare ſight to behold and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider its beames and brightnes; or the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher, who is short ſighted, yet is able to diſcourſe of the motions, influences and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctes, of that great light? What man, in his right witts, will not preferre the Ruſtike be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Philoſopher in that conſideration? Say the like of him who diſcourſeth verie much in Meditation, and yet hath far leſſe taſte and light in heauenly things, though he towle a number of Idea's about his imagination, his memorie, his vnderſtanding, he falls far short notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:7921:127"/>
of the ſweet and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull knowledge which ſprings from the ſimple and amiable attention of Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation. Yet doe I ingeniouſly confeſſe, that this kind of ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple contemplation in ſimple ſoules, which forerunns me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, is but vnpolished, rude, and accompayned with much imperfection. And that that which followes a long exerciſe and practiſe of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, is far more compleate and high: becauſe the ſoule being perſuaded to heauenly Loue, by force of ſo many conſiderations, ratiocinations, affections, aſpirations, reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and other actes of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, doth with much more
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:7921:127"/>
facilitie, light and heate, fall into ſimple actes of Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, hauing ſo frequently and ſo attentiuely beholden taſted and acknowledged a good Truth, or a true Good; and thervpon is inclyned to that loue which doth vnite the hart to God, and thence is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the band of perfection. * Yet this doth in no ſort preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice the propoſition which I made, to witt, that it was eaſier to contemplate then to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, whether we vnderſtand that rude and vnpolished Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, which forerun's, or that ſubtile and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished, which followes the long vſe of Meditation.</p>

               <p>BVT what am I to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre out of all this, THEOPISTE? Marrie, that if by many Actes of Faith, taken out of the Store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe of Meditatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not driue away the thoughtes of infidelitie which doe trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and diſturbe you, you should haue recourſe to the Act of Contemplatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which is more efficacious, and leſſe forced; more powerfull a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:7921:128"/>
your aduerſarie; more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fortable to your ſoule: and fitter to fortifie her in the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue which temptation ſtriues to shake. It is a ſimple and pure acte, deuoyd of all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of diſcourſe &amp; Idea's or if it haue any mixture of any, they are ſo ſubtile and delicate, that they can hardly be perceaued at all. For it happens often by the indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrie of that wicked man who ouerſowes cockle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the good corne, * that the ſame actes, which one would make vſe of to repulſe the darts of temptation, do more incumber then comfort the mynd, and do rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueigle then illuſtrate it. Be

they faire and eaſie, be they violent and rough, they do often tymes equally hurt, while the Diuell doth chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge cures into poyſon, and wounds vs with our owne weapons. Vineger and honie, though contrarie in taſte, yet agree in this effect, that they both inflame the wound into which they are powred. Euen touching and rubing of a ſore doth venime it. To diſpute againſt a temptation is to irritate it. To endeuour to driue it away by force of armes, is to ſtope its depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. To ſtriue to put it out of the memorie, is to engraue it therin. Belzebub Prince of Flies, neuer coming ſo thicke

vpon vs, as when we often ſtrike him off. If you will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue me therfore, you shall not wearie your mynd, by producing inceſſantly Actes of Faith to repelle thoſe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults, but you shall practiſe the counſell of our Bleſſed Father in the 7. Cap. of the 4. Part. of this Philothee, you shall vſe diuerſious; and faire and ſoftely taking, and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ey of your mind off the dreadfull face of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation, you shall ſimply and louingly place it vpon the truth and aſſurance of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Goodnes, and this lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing aſpect, being an act of liuely Faith, quickened and informed by charitie; and
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:7921:130"/>
with all produced in contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation with great facilitie and ſimplicitie, will ſerue you for an impenitrable buckler, againſt all the darts which temptation shall ſend out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt your fidelitie. O who is able to expreſſe vnto you how efficacious this ſimple aſpect is, when it is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paigned by Loue, and how dreadfull it is to the Diuells, ſince it makes the ſoule as terrible vnto them, as an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie rancked and put in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell array: becauſe her powers and faculties being vnited in this contemplatiue acte, are far more ſtrong, then when they vſe their actiuitie in Meditation diſtinctly and

ſeparately. The old Cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pions in wraſtling, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they would exerciſe themſelues therin, came naked vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Theater, and anoynted their bodyes with oyle, that their anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goniſts might catch no hold of them. And wheras tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wherof we now ſpeake, is a ſpirituall wraſtling againſt the Angell of darknes, by how much more naked the ſoule shall be ſtript of all repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and actes, and recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected in her ſelfe, drawing all her forces into the vnitie of her Spirit, more vigorous shall she be, and leſſe hold shall she afford to her enemy.

This word of Faith, inuoking the Diuine aſſiſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, inuited our Sauiour's ſweetneſſe to be mercyfull vnto him.

and cleared your ſelfe of, with a purely free iſſue, you shall be carried vp to the ſuper-eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall raye of the diuine darkneſſes. * Hitherto are the words of this great Sainte, whom all the miſticall diuines behold as their light. Words of gold, and which would not onely merit to be written in marble, but vpon the harts of all thoſe that make profeſſion of a ſpirituall and contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue life. Here is no place to explicate them; I doe but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repreſent them to your eye, or rather to your mynd THEOPISTE, to th'e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that you might note, by the way, the high and inacceſſible couert or hole, where you are to take
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:7921:135"/>
vp your refuge, if your deſire with the doue, to ſaue your ſelfe from the Hawkes tallon, which by the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptation of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, doth ſo eagerly purſue you. You shall find out this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, if, during the ſtorme, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cing all the operations of your ſenſe &amp; reaſon, of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour &amp; ſuperiour part of the ſoule, as well ſenſitiue as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, you retire and betake your ſelfe into your inmoſt cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, the Center, bottome, point and vnity of your Spirit, into the eſſence of your ſoule (for all theſe termes ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the ſame thing amongſt the miſticall Diuines.) And there in the high ſilence and repoſe of all your exteriour
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:7921:135"/>
and interiour faculties you be quiete &amp; ſee that God is God* you taſte and ſee how ſweete he is. * And if in a cloſe vnion you adheare to him by a liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faith: this adheſion will make you one ſame ſpirit with him, according to that of the Apoſtle, he that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heares vnto God, is made one ſpirit with him. * Thus shall you imitate the shells of the Sea, which that they may not be the billowes game, cleaue to the Rocke, as ſoone as they perceaue the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>peſt approch, remaining there immoueable and vnuariable: and you shall cleaue to God; you shall hold him and not let him goe, like to the Spouſe in the Canticles
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:7921:136"/>
you shall tye your ſelfe to the pillar &amp; firmame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Truth, * the holy Church which doth propoſe vnto vs his oracles: a pillar, againſt which all the Gates and Powers of Hell, shall neuer be able to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile. * This is that ſecrete to you, * or rather which is in you, wherof the Prophete ſpeaketh, whither you may retire your ſelfe neere vnto God; who is preſent to the moſt inward corner of your hart, as all the Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues hold, in a moſt peculiar manner. This is the couert of his countenance, vnder which we may shelter our ſelues fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the violence of contradictions and temptations, no otherwiſe

then litle ſucking children, who doe thruſt into, and hide themſelues in their mothers boſome whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any thing feares them. This is the denne where DAVID, perſecuted by SAVLE hidde himſelfe; and where his very enemy fell into his power. This it that great City of Refuge, that Sanctuary, where you may free your ſelfe from your inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible enemies; and where they are not permitted entrie. This is that high place, that sharpe toppe of the Rocke where the Eagles build their neſt, * as IOB ſaith. And that moſt high &amp; ſublime refuge, whereof the Pſalmiſt makes mention, to which no euill
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:7921:137"/>

T'is the Deſert where the woman in the Apocalipſe ſaued her ſelfe, leaſt the drago<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> should haue deuoured her fruite. Theſe are the wings of the doue, which the Pſalmiſt wisheth for, to fly vp to his reſt. * It is in this high degree of Contemplation, that he compares himſelfe to a Peli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cane in the wilderneſſe, a night crow in the houſe, and to a ſparow ſolitary in the houſe toppe.</p>

               <p>THe wiſe-man ſaith, that it is in vaine to ſet ſnares for birds alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die flying, * becauſe a man is not able to force them from the wing: and indeede we neuer reade that the bird of Paradice is caught, nor is she euer found in earth, but when death makes her tumble downe: for hauing no feete, she keepes continually in the open aire, where she doth feede and repoſe. The ſame
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:7921:141"/>
may be ſaid of ſoules, which doe ſoare aboue all ſenſible and intelligible things, yea euen beyond themſelfes, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God. In vaine doe the diuells ſet trappes for them: while their eyes ſtill turnd and ſett vpon God, doe neuer ſleepe, the ſleepe of the death of ſinne. * The litle flies once inueigled in the Spiders netts, ſticke therin: the great ones doe burſt and breake them. Temptations are true Spiders-webbs, which doe ſcarcely euer catch thoſe ſoules, which doe ſoare aboue created things, &amp; which entertayne thoughtes of God, more dearely then all other thoughtes, and are more ſenſible of his touches, then

all other feelings. Thunders, winds, ſtormes, hayle, rayne, and the reſt of the impreſſions of the aire, doe onely beate vpon the midſt, and the foote of the Mountaine Olympus, whoſe toppe enioyes ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and continuall a calme, that that which one writes therin in the duſt, remaynes ſtill in the ſame eſtate, neuer being touched with the leaſt breath of wind. And though the midſt and loweſt part of our ſoule be weather-beaten with the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>peſts and ſtormes of temptation, yet it is in our power, with the aſſiſtance of God's grace, to maintayne the toppe of it in a conſtant peace and ſerenitie, by ſo much the
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:7921:142"/>
greater, by how much it is leſſe knowen, and by ſo much more ſolide, by how much it is leſſe ſenſible. In two parts of the Tabernacle of the Iewe's Temple, there was nothing ſeene but fire, flames, flesh, blood, ſacryficed victi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, ſacryfices; nothing heard, but the brute of beaſtes which were ſlaughtered, and the harmonie, of the heauenly Hymnes and prayſes: But in the SANCTA SANCTORVM, nothing was felt but parfu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes; and the High Preiſt, who alone carried them thither, adored God onely in a high ſile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. It is into this miſterious ſilence of the Sanctuarie of the botome of your hart that

I inuite you to enter, THEO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PISTE, neuer taking notice of the noyce and ruſtling ou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trages of your interiour po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers and faculties: and in this ſort you shall find out that ſo much deſired Peace, tearmed beſt * by the wiſeman. When a towne is beſeiged, at the firſt the inhabitants make ſallies to free the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, till the enemy force them in; and then they conteyne themſelues within the compaſſe of the walls: But if the towne come to be taken by aſſaulte, they retire and betake themſelues into the Caſtle; which being alſo take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they impriſone themſelues in the du<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geon, where they come to reaſonable tearmes of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:7921:143"/>
We are to proceed in like manner in our tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Firſt we are to vſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Actes to rayſe the Seige: but finding the enemy too violent and ſtrong, we are to retire our ſelues into our inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, yea, in caſe the appetire and Powers ſuffer violence, we may shutt our ſelues vp in the verie botome of our ſoule, where full and abſolute Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent doth reſide) and hart, whence the wiſeman ſaith life doth proceede, * and neuer depart or render vp that place till we accord an honorable compoſition, to witt, that our Soueraigne be not offended.

<pb n="273" facs="tcp:7921:146"/>

Whereas parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ones which come with a leſſe noyſe; doe runne like water into the interiour, and as oyle into the bones, * that is, in a ſort inſenſibly and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceptibly.

without euer thinking of the Aske that lyes vnder it, whoſe ſting is mortall. This will be more eaſily conceaued in an exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple. You are te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall againſt all that faith doth teach vs, and there is no kind of abominable Idea to this effect, no kind of brutish infidelity, of execrable blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie, of deteſtable im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pietie, which the wicked ſpirit doth not repreſent vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your hart, to bring you to Athiſme. Loe the Picture of your affliction! But doe you not alſo diſcouer the folly, &amp; foolerie of the diuell therein, as malignant &amp; miſcheeuous as he is? doe you not perceaue that that which you eſteeme
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:7921:147"/>
force and violence, is meere want of force, and infirmity in him, who vſed ſo little flight and guile in laying his ſnares. For your ſoule concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing an inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>parable horrour againſt ſuch like illuſions, falls into the other extreamity, and, though imperceptibly, (which is admirable, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is the worke of the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar of God * in you) diues deeper, and takes better roote in faith, which that hellish Feind ſtriues to roote vp, or shake.

For theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, which for the moſt part, I haue gathered out of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſes of that bleſſed Prelate FRANCIS DE SALES of holy &amp; happie memorie our moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured Father and Directour, may be applyed, not onely to the temptations of blaſphemie and infidelititie, but euen to all other temptations, for that theſe endeuours are not ſo tyed to particularities, as that they doe not alſo deſcend to generalities: being of the number of thoſe Antidotes which are tearmed vniuerſall.</p>

               <p>IN co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluſion, I muſt make the Apoſtolike trumpet ſound in your eares, fight, I, fight, THEOPISTE, as a good and faithfull ſeruant of IESVS CHRIST. * Fight generouſly, ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly, inceſſantly, that by that good Combat you may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue your Faith, and obtayne the crowne of Iuſtice. * Our whole life is a warfare, a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Sweete and gentle cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes are blowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ouer by rough

ſtormes. In the world as on the Sea, the ſtill &amp; calme day, is moſt doubted, moſt ſubiect to rayne. The Calme of the mynd is ſtill eſſayed by ſome rebellion, that ſo ſtanding al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes vpon our gard, temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation may not ſurpriſe vs. * Doth the greatnes of your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſarie aſtonish you? call to mynd that IACOB'S antagoniſt was yet ſtronger. An Angell at libertie, muſt needs exceede thoſe Angells of darknes, who be loaden with their chaynes. Yet at IABOC'S well, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criarke held the Angell play; and though he came halting away, yet victorie and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction was his. Be couragious and the like will befall you.
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:7921:152"/>
And though you haue not a like aduerſarie, yet like IA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>COB, you fight by God's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, a try all of your fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: you fight in the night of Faith, which is inuironed with types, enigma's, clouds. At IA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BOC'S well, ſignifying that you are to cleanſe your ſelfe from all naturall lightes and reaſons, all ſenſible and intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuall know ledge, to betake your ſelfe naked and pure to the toppe of the Spirit, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all the formes and shapes of terreane things, where li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelie and pure Faith keepes her Reſidence. IACOB neuer quitted his hold, till the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell bleſſed him, and the day began to breake. So are you
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:7921:152"/>
inſeparably to hold God, till the rayes of his countenance beginne to shine vpon you. * And till he reſtore the ioy of his Saluation. * Thus shall you become a true Iſraelite, victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and ſeeing God. * Be not troubled that humane reaſon in you comes off halting, you shall walke hereafter vpon a right legg, the Diuine reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wherin conſiſtes the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Faith: An eſſence by ſo much the more pure, by how much it admitts leſſe of the mixture of naturall light and experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. For Faith doth looſe its merite, ſaith S. GRE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GORIE, where experience hath place, being ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, of inuiſible things and
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:7921:153"/>
ſuch as appeare not. * If you deſire to be armed with the Armour of God to defeate the Diuell, throw away, with DAVID, SAVLS armour, ſtripe your ſelfe of humane reaſon, and ſenſe. We are not onely to wraſtle againſt flesh &amp; blood, but Powers and principalities alſo; againſt the Gouernour of the world &amp; wordly darknes; againſt the hyeſt and moſt ſubtile malice of our mortall enemy. * The armour of God therfore is neceſſarie for vs, to ſtand conſtant: to ſtand immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueable like vnto the Mont-Sion. * And to this end we are to retire our ſelues into the verie topp of our Spirit, where God doth ſoueraignely rayne.

He that remaynes there vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the wings of the Higheſt, shall infallibly be deliuered out of the Fowlers ſnare; and vnder that shelter, shall ſing to God the ſong of his deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, adoring this Mercy in the 30. 90. &amp; 123. pſ. or in the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of our B. La. ZACHARIE. SIMEON. But aboue all, be ſure to keepe your ſelfe in this learned ignorance, and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearing onely faythfully to the prime &amp; vniuerſall Truth, which is God, banish from you hart all manner of curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie in point of Faith. Proteſt with the Apoſtle, that you will know nothing here below, but IESVS CHRIST. * Stand fermely, leaſt the enemy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaue

you of your crowne. Forſake the foule &amp; troubled waters of Egipt, to drinke of the pure ſource. Sacryfice your ISAAC, your naturall light, vpon the toppe of this mountaine. Repoſe peaceably in him WHO IS. Be not ſeparated from his Charitie, and your faith is in aſſurance. CHRIST hath reuealed a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full promiſe by the mouth of his beloued diſciples: who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer shall remayne faithfull till death, shall be rewarded with a crowne of life.</p>
