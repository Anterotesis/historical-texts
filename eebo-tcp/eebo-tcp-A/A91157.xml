         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

miſerably oppreſſed, impoveriſhed, diſtracted, and well nigh

and Parliament; the Houfe of <hi>Commons</hi> (when full and free)
voted, <hi>That a Treaty ſhould be had in the</hi> Iſle of Wight, <hi>with the
King in Perſon, by a Committee appointed by both Houſes, upon the Propoſitions
formerly agreed on, and preſented to him at Hampton Court;</hi> which the

the diſtracted minds of the people; and becauſe in the multitude of Counſellors
there is ſafety.</hi> Hereupon all the Members repaired to diſcharge their

age, cold, and infirmity (being unable to fit up all night) departed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Queſtion put, the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> being not the third part of the
Members then preſent. The Army contrary to both Houſes Orders
were drawn up to <hi>Weſtm.</hi> and removed the ordinary Gards of the <hi>Houſe
out of their quarters</hi> during this debate, giving out menaces againſt all who
ſhould vote for the <hi>Conceſſions,</hi> on purpoſe to interrupt and prevent this
Vote, and that by Confederacy with ſome of the <hi>Diſſenting Members.</hi> Yet
ſuch was the courage, conſtancy, and ſincerity of the faithfull <hi>Members,</hi>
that maugre all Oppoſitions and Difficulties, they put and carried the
Vote upon ſuch grounds of <hi>Reaſon, Truth, Juſtice, Honeſty and publick In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,</hi>
as all their Oppoſites were unable to contradict or refute.</p>
            <p>The Vote being paſſed, the Houſe appointed Mr. <hi>Pierpoint,</hi> and ſix other
Members <hi>to repair that Afternoon to the head quarters, to confer with the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
and his Officers, to keep a right underſtanding and good correſpondency
between the Houſe, and the General and Army;</hi> and then adjourned till the
next morning. The Commiſſioners repairing to the head quarters that
Afternoon were ſo rudely treated, <hi>that one or two of them were ſecured by
ſome Army-Officers, and the reſt put off and ſlighted without any conferrence.

early in the morning to <hi>Weſtminster</hi> in a warlike manner, who placed

Members they ſecured all day in the <hi>Queens Court,</hi> refuſing to obey the
Orders of thoſe then ſitting in the Houſe, who being acquainted with
their ſeiſure, ſent the Serjeant twice <hi>to command their attendance in the
Houſe, without any obedience or ſucceſs:</hi> At night all the ſecured Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
but 4, inſtead of being caried to <hi>Wallingford Houſe</hi> to treat with the
<hi>General</hi> and <hi>Officers,</hi> as was promiſed, were unexpectedly thruſt into a

the night, though extreme cold. The next morning 3. more Members
were ſeiſed, and many others ſecluded, affronted coming to the Houſe.
Thoſe in <hi>Hell</hi> about 9. of the clock were carried faſting to <hi>Whitehall,</hi> to
confer with the General and <hi>Army-Officers,</hi> who imperiouſly made them
dance attendance on them in a very cold room without fire (for ſundry
hours) or meat or drink (but ſome burnt Wine and Biskets they ſent for
thither) til 7 a clock at night, not vouchſafing ſo much as to ſee or
confer with any of them, as they promiſed; and then ſent them Priſoners
to the <hi>Kings Head</hi> and <hi>Swan,</hi> through the ſnow and dirt, garded with 3

            <p>2. Whether every Member of Parliament by the Cuſtom and Uſage

freely to give his <hi>Ay,</hi> and <hi>No,</hi> to every <hi>Queſtion</hi> propounded in the
Houſe whiles he is preſent, and finable if he refuſe to do it, without the
leaſt <hi>blame,</hi> cenſure, or pretence of breach of truſt? And whether the
<hi>Freedom</hi> of the Members <hi>debates</hi> and Votes in the <hi>Houſe</hi> in matters there
propounded, be not the very principal, <hi>eſſential, fundamental Privilege of
Parliament,</hi> demanded by every <hi>Speaker,</hi> and granted by every King to
the Members at the beginning of every <hi>Parliament,</hi> and denominating

            <p>3. Whether the Army-Officers and <hi>Council</hi> out of the Houſe, being
Servants only, commiſſioned and paid to guard the Members Privileges,
and obey the Orders of the Houſe; and neither <hi>Electors,</hi> nor impowrers
of the Members ſecluded; be ſit Judges of the Majority of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers

ſo, (as theſe Secluders then and now admit them:) Whether this will not
ſubject thoſe now ſitting, and ſecluding us, with all Members of ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent

ſuppoſed to be, and ſubvert all the Rights, Privileges, Power, Authority

            <p>4. Whether it be not a far greater breach of Privilege, Treaſon, and
levying War againſt the Parliament, in the Army-Officers, and ſitting
Members at their requeſt, thus forcibly to ſecure, ſeclude and eject a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
200 Members, 3. or 4. times one after another, only for voting free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
according to their mindes, conſciences; and refuſing to retract and
proteſt againſt their own and Majorities Votes; than for <hi>Cromwel,
Lambert,</hi> &amp; others, to exclude but 50. 60. or 70. of them, ſitting as an

which ſome deny, upon very good<note n="*" place="margin">See my Plea for the Lords, and Regiſters of Parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Writs.</note> Preſidents and grounds) that the far
