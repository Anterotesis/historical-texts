            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Christos meos</hi> hath in it, two things: not

<hi>His Anointed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>Christos meos</hi> taken together, are the
parties <hi>non tangendae:</hi> Againe, in <hi>Christos
meos</hi> taken in sunder and weighed apart,
are two reasons couched, <hi>de non tangendo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Why <hi>not touched?</hi> first, they bee <hi>His:</hi>
And secondly, <hi>what</hi> of <hi>His? His Anointed.</hi>
These two, be two seuerall: <hi>His anointed,</hi>
is more then <hi>His:</hi> for all that be <hi>His,</hi> be not
<hi>Anointed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>His,</hi> alone, were enough; that they bee
<hi>His,</hi> they pertaine to <hi>him,</hi> and so, <hi>he</hi> to see
them safe.</p>
            <p>But then besides, they be the very choise
and chiefe of <hi>his, His anointed,</hi> and so, a
more speciall care of them, then the rest.</p>
            <p>And then (from the nature of the word)
not onely <hi>his anointed, Vnctieius:</hi> but <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stieius,
His Christs,</hi> which is the highest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of <hi>his anointed:</hi> for higher then that,
ye cannot goe.</p>
            <p>And last, what that is, that maketh them
thus, <hi>his anointed:</hi> to knowe whether they
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:26631:5"/>
may be stripped of it, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>no.</p>
            <p>Then come wee to the Circle or <hi>Fence,</hi>
and that we may diuide too: for, <hi>Nolite
tangere,</hi> is a double <hi>fence,</hi> from the <hi>acte</hi> and

the <hi>touch,</hi> the <hi>acte,</hi> is forbidden. <hi>Nolite
tangere,</hi> (so reade the Fathers) where the
<hi>will</hi> to <hi>touch</hi> is forbidden likewise. <hi>Nolite,</hi>
that is, Haue ye not the <hi>will</hi> nor so much as
an inclination to doe it. So, both the <hi>acte</hi>

            </p>
            <p>In the former, wee are to take the extent
of <hi>Tangere,</hi> and <hi>Christos:</hi> 1. To what

            <p>And so, see we the summe of the Text,
which is sufficient enough to keepe Kings
from <hi>touching,</hi> if it selfe might be kept vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched:
but as the times are, the Text it
selfe is touched, there needes a second <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite

            <p>And, neuer so much neede of this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,

to God, who hath set the print of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:26631:9"/>
appropriate to <hi>Kings,</hi> and to <hi>Kings</hi>

is, whether we will speake, as the <hi>holy Ghost</hi>
doeth, or no? If wee will, then vpon a iust
suruey taken of all the places, where the
worde <hi>Christus Domini</hi> is to bee found in
Scripture, three and thirtie they be in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.
Of which, one only is in the New,<note place="margin">Luc. 2. 26.</note> and
that is of our <hi>Sauiour</hi> himselfe: The rest, all

Of which, twise it is sayd of the <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verse 15.</note>
Here, and in the 105. Psalme (which

are said either of <hi>Christ,</hi> or of <hi>Kings,</hi> all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
neuer applied to any other, but to them on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
And here wee ioyne issue: If to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the <hi>Scripture</hi> apply <hi>Christos Domini,</hi> we
yeeld: If to none but them, we cary it. For,
what reason haue wee, if the <hi>Scripture</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate
it to them, and none but them;
to take it from them, and giue it to others,
to whom the <hi>holy Ghost</hi> neuer gaue it?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:26631:10"/>

                  </note> but
that others, not onely <hi>persons,</hi> but (if they
will) euen <hi>things</hi> too, were <hi>anoynted</hi> vnder
the Law. <hi>Persons,</hi> as <hi>Priests and Prophets:
Things,</hi> as the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> and all the <hi>vessels</hi>

of the <hi>things,</hi> nay nor any of the <hi>persons,</hi>
haue euer the name giuen them, of <hi>Christus
Domini.</hi> No <hi>Prophet,</hi> of all the fellowship
of the <hi>Prophets,</hi> no <hi>Priest,</hi> no not the <hi>high
Priest</hi> himselfe, euer so called. It may bee,
<hi>Annointed,</hi> but not the <hi>Lords Annointed:</hi> it
may be <hi>vncti,</hi> but not <hi>Christi:</hi> or, in a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of one Chapter of the <hi>Maccab.</hi> [<hi>Christi</hi>]
once, but not with his full Christendome,
not <hi>Christi Domini.</hi> Still they fall short: and
<hi>Christus Domini</hi> followes the <hi>King,</hi> and him
onely.</p>
               <p>Yea, this ye shall obserue in their owne
olde Translator: that the same word in
Hebrewe and Greeke, when hee speaketh
of the <hi>Priest,</hi> hee euer turneth it <hi>vnctus;</hi>
when of the <hi>King, Christus</hi> euer: as if of
purpose hee meant by this word, to make a
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:26631:10"/>
partition betweene them. Any will thinke
there was surely meant them some speciall
prerogatiue more then the rest: that from
the rest it is giuen them, and euer to them,
and to none of the rest.</p>
               <p>Wee may well conclude this point then
with the Apostle:<note place="margin">Heb. 1. 4, 5.</note> 
                  <hi>They are made so much the
more excellent then the rest, by how much they
haue obtained a more excellent name then the
rest. For vnto which of all the rest at any time
said hee, Thou are mine Anointed?</hi> Enough,
to settle this terme vpon <hi>Kings.</hi> The Holy
Ghost attributes it to them, and none but
them. Wee to vnderstand it of them, and
none but them. It is, and so let it be, their
owne due stile, their proper denomination.
<hi>Touch not mine Anointed.</hi> Who be they? If
wee goe by the booke, <hi>Princes:</hi> why then,
<hi>Touch not Princes.</hi>
               </p>

To <hi>claime,</hi> is to <hi>touch.</hi> He that saith, <hi>Meos,</hi> he

<hi>Touch</hi> them not,<note place="margin">Lay no title to them.</note> sayth, <hi>Claime</hi> them not.
Some question there is growen <hi>whose</hi> they
be. Two <hi>claimes</hi> there are put in, and laide
to them, besides. <hi>Meos,</hi> saith the <hi>Pope:</hi> and
<hi>Meos,</hi> say some for the people: but neither

<hi>Hee</hi> onely hath the right so to say.</p>

                  <hi>Meos,</hi> saith the <hi>Pope.</hi> For hee, or some by

and because he was master of the <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonie,</hi>
he would be master of the <hi>substance</hi>
too: and <hi>his</hi> they were. The <hi>Pope,</hi> he was
<hi>Gods,</hi> and they were <hi>his anointed,</hi> and of him
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:26631:11"/>
had their <hi>dependence,</hi> and he to <hi>depose</hi> them
and to dispose of them, and to doe with his
owne what hee list. And this <hi>claime,</hi> is not
yet giuen ouer. For hee that shall marke
the <hi>Popes</hi> faintnesse, when some <hi>Kings</hi> are
sought to be <hi>touched,</hi> Nay, are <hi>touched</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed;
out of <hi>his Meos,</hi> will easily thinke he
is well enough content they bee <hi>touched,</hi>
though they be GODS <hi>Anointed,</hi> if they be
not <hi>His</hi> too: <hi>Touch not his:</hi> Not <hi>His:</hi> as for
<hi>others,</hi> it skilleth not, <hi>touch</hi> them, who will.</p>
               <p>But this <hi>claime</hi> by the <hi>Ceremony,</hi> is cleane
marred, by this Text: for when these words
here were spoken, there was no such <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie</hi>
instituted, it was <hi>Nonens,</hi> no such
thing then <hi>in rerum naturâ.</hi> That came
not vp, till <hi>Moses:</hi> Now these here in the
Text, were in their graues long before <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
was borne; No <hi>Meos</hi> then; no <hi>claime</hi> by
the <hi>Ceremonie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And after it came vp, no <hi>Priest</hi> went out <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
of <hi>Iury</hi> to <hi>Persia</hi> to cary the <hi>Ceremonie</hi> to <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus:</hi>

Cyro Christo meo, Thus saith the Lord, to
Cyrus mine Anointed,</hi> and yet neuer came
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:26631:12"/>
there any <hi>oyle</hi> vpon his head. So that euen
after it was taken vp, yet the <hi>Ceremonie,</hi> and
the <hi>claime</hi> by it, would not holde. The
trueth is, the <hi>Ceremony</hi> doth not any thing;
onely declareth what is done. The <hi>partie</hi>
was before, as much as he is after it; onely
by it is declared to be, that hee was before,
and that which he should haue beene still,
though hee had neuer so beene declared.
The trueth may and doeth subsist, as with
the <hi>Ceremonie,</hi> so without it. It may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined,
as with some it is, and with vs it is;
and it may be spared, as it is with others:
Spared, or reteined, all is one, no <hi>claime</hi>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> But last of all, where it was vsed, as by <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi>
to <hi>Saul,</hi> by <hi>Sadoc</hi> to <hi>Salomon:</hi> yet they
<hi>claimed</hi> nothing in the <hi>parties</hi> they anoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
but called them still <hi>Gods,</hi> and neuer

as it was but a <hi>Ceremonie;</hi> he that ministreth
the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> hath no interest in the <hi>partie</hi>

the inference of this point, and the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

               </p>
               <p>One thing more of <hi>Christos meos:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">What this <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ointing</hi> is.</note> For I

is, and leaue a point loose, that needeth
most of all to be touched. Vpon miscon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing

be <hi>vnchristed,</hi> and cease to be <hi>Christi Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni,</hi>
and then, who that wil, may <hi>touch</hi> them.</p>
               <p>They that haue beene scribling about
Kings matters of late, and <hi>touching</hi> them
with their pennes, haue beene foully mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

of <hi>Anointed</hi> I finde in Scripture: Saul, and
Dauid: the one <hi>in esse,</hi> the other in <hi>fore:</hi>
one in being, the other to be. If Dauid had
beene <hi>touched,</hi> (Saul yet liuing) though but
<hi>Anointed</hi> to succeede, I make no doubt, this
Commandement had bene broken: For
we are bound by it, to preserue the <hi>anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,</hi>
not onely vpon the head, but euen in
the streames, running downe from it: that
with the King himselfe, the whole race
Royall is folded vp in this word, euery one
of them in their order, that not one of
them is to be <hi>touched</hi> neither.</p>
               <p>This barre then, is set to the <hi>touch</hi> euery
way, and to the <hi>touch</hi> of them, and euery
of theirs, euery way. But, there is a further
matter yet: For, (if wee marke it well) it is
not, <hi>Ne tangite,</hi> but <hi>Nolite tangere: Nolite,</hi>
(that is) haue not so much as the <hi>will,</hi> once
to goe about it. So that, not onely <hi>tactus,</hi>

                  <hi>touch</hi> no way but that. And Gods meaning
is absolute: neither bodie nor soule should

               </p>
               <p>And <hi>Nolite</hi> standeth first, beginneth the

               <p>In that it is in the first <hi>Halleluia</hi> of all, it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>

hath taught it; They wel setling of the Arke,

Psalme.) But assoone as euer they once

then breake off all those behinde, and

all our posteritie, euen to the children yet

I cannot say, for <hi>touched</hi> he was, and more
then <hi>touched:</hi> But, in the <hi>touch,</hi> there is no
great matter (we said,) but for the <hi>hurt;</hi> so
that in the end, <hi>not hurt,</hi> is as good, as <hi>not
touched.</hi> As good, nay better, for a <hi>Halleliuia.</hi>
For, to be <hi>touched,</hi> as he was, and to take no
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:26631:38"/>
                  <hi>hurt,</hi> is a greater deliuery farre, then at all
not to be <hi>touched.</hi> To goe through the Red
sea, and not wet a threed: To haue bene in
the fornace, and no sent of the fire; that is
the miracle. So, to haue bene <hi>touched,</hi> and
taken by the throat, (that the marke was to
be seene, many dayes after;) To be <hi>thrust at</hi>
and <hi>throwen downe,</hi> as Hee was, and yet no

power, and here was the mercy of GOD;
Here it was certainely, and that so sensible,
ye might euen <hi>touch it.</hi>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> And here <hi>Halleluia</hi> first: and wee to
praise him, that when <hi>Nolite tangere,</hi> would
not serue in word, made <hi>Non permisit nocere</hi>
to serue in deed: Came forth, first, with <hi>non
permisit nocere,</hi> as with his shield, &amp; so shiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
him, that Hee suffered him not to take
any hurt at all; <hi>Anointed</hi> the shield, made it
slippery, their hands slid off, their <hi>touch</hi> did
him no harme. <hi>Non permisit,</hi> was as His
shield, that he brought foorth to saue Him.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> But besides it, he brought foorth his sword
too, &amp; cut them short: <hi>Corripuit eos,</hi> was his
sword, <hi>touched</hi> them with it, and twitched
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:26631:38"/>
them for <hi>touching his Anointed, touched</hi> them
with Pharao's <hi>tactus maximi,</hi> that the
markes of it will bee seene vpon them and
theirs, for euer.</p>
               <p>For either of these seuerally, a seuerall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
                  <hi>Halleluia:</hi> but especially, for not seuering
them, but letting them meet and go toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>Eripuit,</hi> and <hi>Corripuit,</hi> both ioyntly
arme in arme. Not either alone, this, or
that, Not, <hi>permisit nocere, sed corripuit,</hi> suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
them to do hurt, but rebuked them:
No, but <hi>Non permisit, &amp; corripuit,</hi> both, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
them not to doe any hurt; and rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
them, and cut them short too besides.</p>
               <p>And this happy coniunction of these
both, is it, which maketh the speciall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
of our thankes this yeere, more then
the last, or any before. For that, since, and
very lately, GOD, that suffered not <hi>Him,</hi>
hath suffered some other King, to bee

that did that execrable acte, <hi>Corripuit <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
