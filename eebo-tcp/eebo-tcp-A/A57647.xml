         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <hi>I.</hi> I will therefore briefly set down the reasons that have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced me to side with the <hi>Aristotelians.</hi> And first concerning the Heart: I finde that it is the first member that lives and is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in our bodies; and consequently the noblest and chiefest of all our members, whatsoever the <hi>Galenists</hi> say to the contrary. For 1. The Heart is placed in the midst of the breast, as the Sun in the midst of the world, that it might impart its vital heat and motion to all parts: So the seed is in the midst of the fruit. 2. Where there is a <hi>medium</hi> there must needs be <hi>extreams</hi>; but we finde in mans body this <hi>medium</hi>; to wit, that there are some parts which both give and receive life and motion; therefore there must be some that receive but give not; and consequently some that give but receive not; and this must be the heart, or brain, or liver: for to make more originals then one, is needless, seeing Nature always tends to, and aims at unity. Now that the heart is this principal, appears by these reasons. 3. First, that is most likely to be the originall of life, sense, and motion in other members, which is most apt and capable of these; and so, that had first life and motion, which had the greatest inclination and aptitude to receive them; but the heart of all other parts is most apt to receive these from the formative faculty: Therefore doubtless this faculty in the seed, would first produce the heart, as being a matter pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to receive first the impressions of the formative. 4. What the heart is in Animals, that the root is in Vegitables; but the root is the first thing the plant thrusts out; therefore the heart is first formed. 5. The heart dieth last, therefore it lived first: for this method Nature observes, that the parts which are last made, decay first, as the eies and teeth; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that decayeth last, which was framed first. 6. They that have been curious by inspection into eggs, to observe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures progress in the generation of the chick, have found a red spot the third day, which had a motion like palpitation; this could be nothing else but the heart. 7. The other mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers cannot live without the heart, but the heart can live without the other members, as I have seen a Monkeys heart live a great while after it hath been taken out of the body: If then the life of the other members depends from the heart,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57373:10"/>
and not the heart from them, the heart must needs be the first that liveth.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. The heart imparts the vitall heat to the other parts, it must therefore have existence before the other parts; for operation follows the existence. 9. The formative power of the seed doth not operate but by the vital heat of the heart; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this must be first, before that can operate. 10. The matter cannot be disposed, to receive the form of the members, nor can the parts be distinguished one from another, without the heat and motion of the heart. 11. Nature in her operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons aims at an end; but where there is an end, there is order; and where there is order, there is priority, and something that was first.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <hi>II.</hi> There are some who hold that the heart is not first gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, but that all the members are at the same time begot and formed together: But this cannot be so; for in the Embryo we see that all the parts are not equally articulated and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured, but some sooner, some later. 2. We see this in art, which imitates Nature; for the artificer carves and figures one part before another. 3. We see the teeth are begot long after the other parts; for nature produceth the members as there is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> of them; the infant needs no teeth whilst it feeds on milk. 4. If all the parts are at the same time framed and articulated, then all the body is at the same time perfected; but this is not Natures work, which proceeds by degrees to perfection, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving imperfect beginnings.</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <hi>III.</hi> The <hi>Galenists</hi> object, that Nature had to no purpose made the heart before the rest of the body, seeing there is no use of the heart till the body be formed. I answer, there is a two-fold use, namely, of Animation, and of preparation; the heart could not animate the body before it was, but it could prepare the matter by its vital heat and motion to receive the impression and influence of the formative power, working by the heart on the matter; the heart then is usefull, not only to the body after it is generated but also whilst it is in <hi>Fieri</hi>; and in generation, the heart is the foundation of the whole corporeal Fabrick; we cannot say the foundation is needless, because it is laid before the house is built; for though it doth not support the superstructure before it be, yet it is ready and sitted to support it, when it shal be: Neither will it follow, that because the house before it is built needs, no foundation, therefore the foundation must not be first laid. There is need of priority and order; the building needs it, when it shall
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57373:11"/>
be, and the builder needs it before it be: though the body not yet formed needs not the heart, yet the formative power needs it. Secondly, they object that the formative power is common to all the parts alike, having no more relation to one then to another; and therefore works upon them all alike, and produceth them together. I answer, God is the common and universal cause of all his creatures; yet he did not create them all in one day; the universality of the cause, excludes not the order of casuality; nor is the common relation it hath to the effects, any reason of producing them all at one time. Again, though the formative power hath an equal relation to all parts, as they are parts; yet it hath a nearer relation to the heart, as being its organ, by which it works on the other parts.</p>
                     <p n="4">
                        <hi>IV.</hi> If it be asked whether the heart be perfect or imperfect before the other members be articulated. I answer; It is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, if it be compared with any other member, but imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect if compared with the whole <hi>compositum.</hi> Again, it is imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect to what it shal be, when it shall be fitted with all necessary Organs for animation. 2. If again it be asked, how the heart can live without nutriment, seeing the liver by blood feeds it. I answer, though the liver be not yet formed, yet the heart is nourished by some adjacent matter, as the chick is by the yeolk of the egg; and this nourishment sufficeth the heart, till blood, a perfect nutriment be prepared. Again, the nutritive faculty doth not flow from the liver, as the vitall from he heart, but it is inherent and implanted into every part, as well in the heart as in the liver; whereas the vitall is implanted only in the heart, and from thence flowing into every member. Lastly, we may say that the heart needs no food, till there be a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendition, or wasting of its substance.</p>
                     <p n="5">
                        <hi>V.</hi> The unity of the vegetive soul cannot be preserved in so many different temperaments; or the body, (for there are as many as there are parts) if it were not for the common tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament of the heart, in which all the others are united, receiving from thence heat and spirits: It was needfull then that the heart should be first formed, as being the common originall of all the other parts, all which may be said to have but one common temperament, and one soul, because there is but one heart.</p>
                     <p n="6">
                        <hi>VI.</hi> Though the <hi>Galenists</hi> affirm that the heart hath but two ventricles; yet the <hi>Aristotelians</hi> in affirming three in bigger creatures, seem to speak more reason: For if in bigger animals there is greater store of spirits, and a greater elaboration of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57373:11"/>
them, then in the lesser, it stands with reason that their hearts being bigger, should have also more receptacles for containing the vitall blood and spirits, then the lesse.</p>
                     <p n="7">
                        <hi>VII.</hi> It stands also with reason, that the substance of the heart, is nervous, that it might be the more firm and solid. 2. Because the heart is the original of motion, which is performed by the nerves. 3. Because the substance of the veins and arteries, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the heart is the originall, is nervous.</p>
                     <p n="8">
                        <hi>VIII.</hi> The parts which the <hi>Galenists</hi> call Spermaticall, are not made of the <hi>Sperma,</hi> or Seed, more then any other parts are, but of the dryer and more solid parts of the blood, as the Sanguineall are of the thinner parts thereof. 2: The males seed is onely active, the woman hath no other seed then the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struous blood, which is meerly passive; in both which seeds there is a power or potentiality of generation; the active in the male, the passive in the female, both which are from the heart. In this also I subscribe to <hi>Aristotle.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="9">
                        <hi>IX.</hi> I cannot assent to the <hi>Galenists,</hi> in affirming the liver rather then the heart to be the first that lives in us, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the original of other parts, because it is bigger, and near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to the matrix, then the heart; for the <hi>Aristotelians</hi> say well, that the original of things consisteth not in bulk, but in vertue; the seeds of trees and plants are least in bulk, and yet are the originals of great bodies. 2. The vicinity to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix is not the cause of priority; for the matrix is the place of, but not an agent in generation; the agent is only the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative faculty in the seed.</p>
                     <p n="10">
                        <hi>X.</hi> Both <hi>Aristotelians</hi> and <hi>Galenists</hi> affirm, that the child at first lives the life of a plant; but from hence the <hi>Aristotelian</hi> concluds, that the heart is the first members begot in us, because it is answerable to the root in plants, which is first generated; but the <hi>Galenist</hi> infers, that the liver must be the first member, because the child living the life of a plant, hath no other facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty but nutritive, which is the faculty of the plant, the seat whereof is in the liver. But here I side with <hi>Aristotle,</hi> because the liver is no more the seat of nutriment then the heart: And because the heart is as the root; but it is by the root the plant lives and is nourished: And if the liver be the seat of nutriment, because of the blood thereof; I should rather say the heart is this seat, because we finde blood there out of the veins, as in a cistern; but in the liver there is no other Blood, then what is in the veins: Neither can the liver be the originall of the nutritive power, because there is the sense of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57373:12"/>
indigence or want; for so the stomack should rather be this originall, because there is the most exquisit sense of want.</p>
                     <p n="11">
                        <hi>XI.</hi> The liver cannot be generated without heat and spirits; But the seat of heat and spirits is the heart, therefore this must be first. If any will say that the heat of the matrix is sufficient; I deny it; for that heat is onely conservative, not generative; it hardeneth and consolidateth the outward parts, but doth not produce the inward.</p>
                     <p n="12">
                        <hi>XII. Aristotle</hi> will have the right ventricle of the Heart the nobler; <hi>Galen</hi> the left; but I subscribe to <hi>Aristotle</hi>; because I finde that the right Ventricle liveth longer then the left. 2. That the Pulse in the right side of him that is dying, is more valid then in the left side. 3. The right ventricle leans upon the lungs as upon a Cushion or supporter, Nature shewing as it were, a greater care of this then of the other. 4. The right parts are nimbler and stronger then the left, because they are hotter. 5. Though the spirits receive their completion in the left ventricle, yet they are prepared and fitted in the right; and therefore there needs not so great a heat in the left ventricle, as the <hi>Galenists</hi> speak of; for a moderate heat will suffice to perfect that which is already begun. 6. The left ventricle is but a servant to the right, in finishing that work which was begun by the right, and distributing it into the body, being finished.</p>
                     <p n="13">
                        <hi>XIII.</hi> The <hi>Aristotelians</hi> make the vital and nutritive faculty the same; the <hi>Galenists</hi> make them distinct; but the <hi>Peripateticks</hi> reason prevails with me, which is this; That where there are distinct faculties, there must be distinct operations, because the faculty is for the operation; But there are no distinct operations of the vital faculty, from that of the nutritve; for accretion, diminution, and generation are actions of the vital or nutritive: Sense and motion are actions of the animal faculties. 2. Life is the presence of the soul in the body; this presence consists in action, this action is nutrition; for when this action fails, life fails; because the chief and first action of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving creature is to preserve it self, which cannot be without nutrition; seeing nutrition is not without tact in the sensitive creature; but when tact faileth, animality must needs fail.</p>
                     <p n="14">
                        <hi>XIV.</hi> The <hi>Aristotelians</hi> make heat the efficient cause of the hearts publick motion: Others will have the soul; O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the vegetive faculty; but <hi>Aristotle</hi> is in the right; for the soul works by its faculties, and these by heat; so that heat is the immediate cause of this motion, and the souls instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57373:12"/>
yet not such an instrument as worketh nothing but by the force of the principal agent; for the heat worketh by its own natural force, though it be directed and regulated by the soul; the heat then of the heart rarifying the blood into va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors, which require more room, dilate the heart; but by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling some of these vapors into the arteries, and receiving also some cold air by the lungs, the heart is contracted, this is called <hi>Systole,</hi> the other <hi>Diastole</hi>: And as heat is the efficient cause, so it is also the end of this motion. For therefore doth the heat move the heart, that it by this motion might impart heat to the body. But I understand not here by heat, a bare quality, but that which is called [<hi>Calidum innatum</hi>] If it be objected, that there is in Plants a vegetive faculty and heat, but not this pulsifick motion, nor yet in effects. I answer; the reason is, because there are not instruments fit for such a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor is there any use of it. 2. This motion of the heart is local not totally, but partially; for not the whole heart, but the parts thereof change their place or seat, and so in this regard augmentation and diminution are local mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                     <p n="15">
                        <hi>XV.</hi> That the heart is not only first formed, but is also first informed, and first exerciseth the action of life, is plain by this reason drawn from the <hi>Peripateticks</hi>: the heart was made at first an Organical member; but that could not be, if it was not first informed by the soul, which is the first act of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganical body: and if it was made organicall, it had been made to no end, and nature had been idle, to have made an use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less member, which could no more deserve the name of heart, then a blinde eye, the name of eye: But the soul that I speak of here, is the vegetive or sensitive resulting out of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which is first prepared in the heart for reception of it; and not the reasonable soul, which with all its perfections is cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated and infused by God, into the whole body after it is ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulated, and made capable of such a noble Guest.</p>
                     <p n="16">
                        <hi>XVI.</hi> The <hi>Aristotelians</hi> are more rational in placing but one principall member in the body, then they who place either three or four: For it is nedless to make so many principals, when as one will suffice: Nature aimeth always at unity; for all the five senses are united in one common sense; all the members in one body; all the different specificall parts of the world into one common nature; so all the members into one heart, which hath in it the natures of all, or their tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: Nor could the soul being but one, work upon so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57373:13"/>
different temperaments, if they were not united into one temperament: Besides, we should be forced to run <hi>in infinitum,</hi> if we should hold more principles then one; for avoiding of which inconvenience, we must stay in one chief principle. If it be objected, that the nerves, veins and arteries are of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent temperaments, therefore must proceed from different principles. I Answer, that from one principle in which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers temperaments are united, may issue different tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. 2. I denie that the temperature of the veins, nerves and arteries are different, otherwise then <hi>Secundum magis, &amp; minus.</hi>

The heart and veins have the same essential form, which is nutritive or vitall; the same essential work and end also which is to nourish the body, or to give it life and vegetation. The like may be said of the nerves; therefore it must follow, that the matter of the heart, veins and nerves is the same; and that from the heart they have their beginning.</p>

                     <p>THough the organs offense be in the brain, yet the originall of sensation is the heart, because it is the originall of the spirits, the chief causes of sensation, and without which the organs were no organs: But the frigidity of the brain is not the cause of sensation, nor of the sensitive spirits; it only tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers the heat of the heart and vital spirits, that they may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come animal. Neither is softness and hardness any thing to sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, seeing this is no material but a spiritual and perfective quality. Now the heart is sensitive, not by the animal spirits
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57373:15"/>
derived thither from the brain; for these spirits in the heart would quickly lose their temper, by reason the heat of the heart is a more active quality then the coldness of the brain; but it feeleth by its own spirits, whether we call them vital or animal, or both. For the spirits being turned from vital to animall, receive only an alteration, but not a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial change. For that only is in the aliments, which is transubstantiate into our bodies.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <hi>II.</hi> The brain being cold and moist, useth to convert su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous vapours into those humours which most resembleth it self in these qualities, to wit, into watrish Catharrs, and cold distillations: therefore it is likely that the brain can transform the vital spirits into other more excellent then themselves; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially seeing coldness is a quality hurtful to nature, which consisteth in heat and moisture, and hath no other use in our bodies, but to condensat and to temper the activity of our natural heat; therefore we finde the animal spirits most active and copious in those creatures that abound most in heat, as in Men, Lions, Birds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and in young men more then in old men.</p>

But how can the animal spirits subsist without the vital? Or how can that be called an animal or sensitive creature, whose vital spirits are dead, seeing there can be no sense where there is no life, nor life where the vital spirits are dead? 2. The animal spirits are not generated of the aire, which we draw in by breathing; for there can be no generation without mixtion, nor mixtion but of divers bodies: Now the aire is but one simple body, which cannot make a perfect mixtion without the other ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. If it be objected, that the air is impure, and not sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, I answer, Though the aire be not pure, yet it is not a mixed body Physically and properly, but only by apposition, as Wheat and Barley may be said to be mixed when they are joyned together, which is no Physical mixtion, wherein the elements lose their forms.</p>

And that they are not wasted is plain, because they are not consumed by nutrition, as not being fit to nourish; nor by sensation, seeing this is a spiritual and perfective not a material or destructive act. Nor lastly by transpiration; for nothing is exhaled but excrements.

Aristotles</hi> reasons for the coldnesse of the brain, are to me not improbable, or easie to be answered: for if the brain were hot, we should never sleep, seeing coldness causeth sleep. 2. There are more moist humors and flegme ingendred in the brain, then any where else. 3. There is not blood in the brains, as in other parts of the body; for it is the blood that warms the body. I say there are not veins incorporating themselves into the substance of the brain, and terminating there, as they do in the flesh and skin; which is the cause that every part of the flesh or skin being pricked, bleeds; so doth not the brain, whose substance is white and bloodless; therefore though there be veins in the brain, yet they are distinct from the substance of the brain, and not ending in them; neither is that heat which is in the brain, its own, but adventitious and externall, to wit, of the arteries and veins, as also of fumes and vapours: so then the brain is the coldest of all the parts of mans body, yea colder then the bones, because the bones are dry, the brain moist: but cold with moisture is greater effectively then with siccity, so the water is colder then the earth.

                     <p n="1">I. AS <hi>GOD</hi> hath bestowed upon Man the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Soul of all others; so hath he fitted him with a Body answerable to such a Soul, of which no other Body is capable; and if it were, yet for want of fit Organs, the Soul could not exercise her fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; as we see in that Fiction of <hi>Apuleius,</hi> whose soul being in the body of an Asse, could neither speak, nor write, nor doe any thing but what was proper to an Asse; yet I have read of <hi>Tritons,</hi> or Fishes having the face, lineaments, and shape of mans body; One was seen in the days of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> another in the time of <hi>Augustus,</hi> a third under <hi>Nero: Pliny, AElian, Theodor Gaza, Trapezuntius, Alexander ab Alexandro, Scaliger,</hi> and divers others affirm the truth of this; yet these <hi>Tritons</hi> or <hi>Nereides,</hi> cannot be called, nor are they men, though they have the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward shape: for it is not the matter, not outward lineaments, but the form that gives essence and denomination.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. Mans body is of all others the most perfect and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent; though he hath not wings like a bird to fly, nor can see so far as an Eagle, nor hear so quickly as a Fox, nor smell so well as a Dog, nor taste so well as Poultry, nor hath so quick a tact as Oysters and Spiders; yet his hands, speech, and reason,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57373:18"/>
doe countervail all these: for celerity and reception his senses yeild to the beasts; for variety and judgement they must yeild to him.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. Though mans soul in respect of understanding and will, be inorganical, and therefore not properly resident in any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular member more then in another, yet accidentally, because the brain is the seat of the fantasie, from which the intellect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives its objects, and the heart the seat of the affections, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servient to the will; the brain is the seat of the intellect, the heart of the will.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. There is in us a twofold heat, the one celestial, the other elementary: that preserves us, this destroys us: that concocts our food, and turns it into nutriment, this corrupts and putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies it, and turns it into noxious humours and excrements, as we see in burning Fevers. It is not then every heat that chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifieth or sanguifieth, or assimulateth, but this celestial heat: Neither is it the quantity, but the quality thereof, and affinity it hath with the things concocted: For there is more heat in a Lion, then in a Pigeon, and yet the Pigeon will concoct that which the Lion cannot; yet this celestial heat is helped by the elementary heat if it be temperate, and by the crasis, tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rament, or constitution, if it be sound.</p>
                     <p n="5">V. Nothing by way of food can cherish our natural heat, and maintain our life, but what had life and heat it self; and the more perfect life it had, the better it nourisheth, as having nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer affinity with us. Hence animals nourish more then vegita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, because the matter of their bodies and spirits, are more consonant to ours then of hearbs or fruits, which if they bee contrary to us in their nature and qualities, they destroy us, as poisonable hearbs do. Purging medicaments are of a middle nature, as having some similitude with the humours of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, which they attract; as Agary with Flegme, Rubarb with Choler, &amp;c. and some dissimilitude with our bodies, upon which they work by weakning them, especially if they have any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latory quality.</p>

Though the woman in conception, or afterwards, can by the strength of imagination impresse some note or mark upon the seed or Embryo: yet she cannot alter the sex or form as she pleaseth, because this is not the work of imagination, but of a diviner power, to wit, of the external formative agent; for which cause a man cannot beget any other then a man, for that his seed is not capable of any other form, neither doth the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative agent work otherwise the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </argument>
                     <p>THough the Stomach and Lights be two noble parts of the body for those that are to live long; yet life can consist without them or their action: For 1. Some have lived with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out chilification and respiration: the meseraick veins can draw some portion of the clysters to the liver for sanguification, by which life can be preserved. 2. Divers creatures live all the Winter, as Swallows, Cuckows, Dormise, &amp;c. without any chilification or action of the stomach. 3. Women that are hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterical, can live only by transpiration, without respiration at all. 4. The arteries can draw air to the heart, though there were no lungs at all, yet not with that conveniency, because the lungs temper and qualifie the frigidity of the air before it comes to the heart. 5. Fishes breath not at all, nor have they any lungs, yet they live.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. In the motion of our bodies the limbs are moved by the muscles, these by the nerves, the nerves by the animal spirits, and these by the soul, which produceth neither sense nor moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the body without these spirits: for if the nerve be cut or obstructed, or bound, motion ceaseth; which sheweth that the soul worketh by these spirits, and that in the nerve there is more then a bare faculty of sense and motion required to make it move and feel: for in the obstructed nerve there is the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty still, but not the motion, because the spirits are intercep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which have their original from the brain as well as the nerves, but their action from the soul. 2. These spirits are bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, as appears by their generation, fatigation &amp; dissipation: for when these spirits fail, motion ceaseth, and we grow weary. 3. In the nerve though one and the same animal spirit causeth both sense and motion; yet a greater vigour is required for motion then for sensation, because the perfection of this consists in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception only, but of that in action chiefly. Now more force is required for action then for passion. 4. In the animal spirits there is a light or splendour, because they are a very attenuated
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:57373:19"/>
substance, warmed by a celestial heat: This light is perceived in the eye being shut, in the other senses it is not seen, because their organs are not transparent: Now the spirit of the eye is the same with that of the ear, &amp;c. 5. The spirits are not proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the instruments of the soul, because the soul is the form which worketh immediatly upon its matter; and the spirits are parts of this matter, but they are called instruments, becaus they convey to the members the faculties of the soul. 6. Though the will moves the muscles in men, and the will moves accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to knowledge and election; yet in infants the muscles are moved by a natural instinct, and so they are in beasts who have not election and reason.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. Man hath a larger and more capacious brain then other creatures have; because the soul of man being endowed with more faculties, required a larger habitation. 2. The brain is void of sense and feeling, because it is the Judge of all the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. Thus the eye which seeth all colours, hath no colour it self, nor the tongue and palat any taste, which judgeth of all tastes; experience sheweth, that the wounded brain being cut or prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, feeleth not. 3. Though the brain feeleth not, yet it hath a natural faculty to expel things hurtful; so there are antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies and sympathies in insensitive things. 4. The brain hath no animal motion, though it be the original of this motion; yet it hath a natural motion of <hi>Systote</hi> and <hi>Diastole</hi> for the generation of the spirits, and expulsion of noxious things. 5. The brain is cold and moist; cold naturally, but hot accidentally, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the spirits and arteries in it: cold, otherwise the attenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated animal spirits in it would quickly wast and consume with heat; and with often study and cogitation, it would soon be inflamed, and so into phrenzies wee should bee apt to fall. 6. Though the brain be cold, and the heart hot, yet the animal spirits are more attenuated then the vital, because these are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated immediatly of the grosse bloud, whereas the animal are begot of the vital spirits, and are refined by the arteries of the brain. 7. The brain is moist, 1. That it may the more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily receive impressions: 2. That it may the better resist infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation: And 3. That the nerves may by its moisture bee the more pliable, which otherwise would be stiffe.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. The Eye is the most noble of all the senses: 1. Because its action is quickest, apprehending its object in an instant: 2. Though the object be never so far distant, it is perceived by the eye, as the stars are. 3. Because light, which is the object of the eye, is of all accidents the most noble. 4. The eye hath
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57373:20"/>
more objects then any other sense; for besides light and colour of all sorts, its particular objects, it hath also number, magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, state, motion and figure, which are common objects. 5. None of the senses hath such a curious fabrick: for the eye hath six tunicles, three humours, six muscles, two nerves, the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick and motory, many veins and arteries. 6. It is the first and chief organ of knowledge; for at first men got their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge by observation and the eye, though now we have it by instruction and the ear. 7. The eye hath the highest place of all the senses in the body. 8. And it hath the perfectest figure, for it is almost round, that it may move the easier and swifter. 9. It hath a liberty and command of it self which the other sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses have not; for it can inclose it self within its casements, and open them when it pleaseth. 10. It hath a peculiar light within it self, besides that light which is in the air, and it hath more spirits then any other of the senses, and these spirits are more subtle, nimble, and quick then any other animal spirits are. 11. Without the eye no living creature could finde out its food, in which consisteth the life of the creature. 12. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the eye men could not have naturally attained to the knowledge of God, and of Divinity; for by the contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Heavens, and their light and motions, men came to have the knowledge of their Maker: For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world, are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20.</p>
                     <p n="5">V. The eye is of a watrish not of a fiery substance, as may bee seen, 1. By the water that flowes from it when it is hurt: 2. By the fat which is about it; this would consume if the eye were fiery: 3. By the watrish humour which is in the cavities of the face in the new formed Embryo: 4. By the reception and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of the species; for the fire can neither receive nor confer any image or species, as the water doth.</p>
                     <p n="6">VI. Though there be two eyes, there is but one sight, or one object seen; 1. Because the optick nerves are united in one before they reach to the eyes: 2. Because there is but one fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, and one common sens which judgeth of the external object.</p>
                     <p n="7">VII. The eye in respect of its grosse and solid parts, is a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient in seeing, by receiving the species or shape, (not the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance) into the chrystalline humor; but in respect of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits in the eye, it is an agent by perception of the species, and partly a patient: for there is some impression in the spirits, or else by them the species could not be conveyed into the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sense and phantasie: The spirits then are agents, not out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57373:20"/>
upon the object, but inwardly upon the spirits received from the object: and when they are employed about som other thing in the phantasie, the eye seeth not its object, though the species be impressed in the chrystalline; because there is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for sight, not only the impression in the chrystalline, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so a perception and apprehension in the spirits; in which action properly and formally vision consisteth. And though the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits be no part of the eye as it is a solid substance, yet they are part as the eye is the instrument of sight.</p>
                     <p n="8">VIII. There are in the eye when it seeth, two lights, the one from without, whereof there is greatest quantity in the white of the eye; the other from within, which is most preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in the chrystalline, disposing it to receive the species, as the outward light disposeth the air. The outward light, if it bee not proportionable to the inward, makes this unfit for visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not by extinguishing, or destroying it, for one light cannot destroy another; but by too much extending or destroying the mean and proportion of the inward light. There is besides these two, a third light in the eies of owls, cats, &amp; such creatures as live by preying in the dark, which light is not immanent in the eye, but transient into the air, that the medium being il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminate, the species of the object might be raised.</p>
                     <p n="9">IX. The eye hath not such colours as are made by the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the four elements, or prime qualities, but such only as are made by the mixture of the light and the diaphanous or perspicuous body. The first sort of colours are in the dark in respect of their existence or quality: the second sort hath no existence at all in the dark: And though the light give not the first act or beeing to colours, yet it giveth the second act in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them visible, and actuating them, to work upon the eye, by sending their species thither.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>THAT there is in living creatures besides the elementary heat, another called celestial, is manifest, because the fire or elementary heat, neither in part, nor in whole, is the cause
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57373:21"/>
of generation. 2. Because the elementary heat remains after the celestial is gone, as may be seen in spices, which retain or rather increase their elementary heat, as they grow drier, being separate from the Tree; and yet they want that celestial heat by which they did live and had vegetation; for now being dead, nutrition, attraction, vegetation, growth, and other fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of life cease, which were the effects of the celestial heat. 3. Because in Mandrakes and other cold herbs, there is this celestial heat, by which they live; and yet no elementary heat at all; for they are cold both actually and vertually.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. As in living creatures there be divers dissimular parts, so there be temperaments, and diversity of heat; all which are united in the heart, the fountain of heat, which it communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates to all parts by the bloud and spirits; this primitive heat is in perfect creatures compacted within the heart; in Trees and Plants, within the root; in Insects it is diffus'd through all the body, without any union in one part more then another; which is the cause that when snakes and worms are cut in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, every piece moves, which is not so in the hand or foot of perfect animals if they be cut off; so wee see in some twigs of Trees, that being set in the ground, grow and take root; which shews, That the original heat and substance of the root, is in every part of the Tree; and that the primitive heat of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture might bee brought to a temper, refrigeration is required, which in terrestrial animals is performed by the air, in fish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es by the water, in herbs by the earth moistned, by which they are nourished and refreshed.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. The animal and vital spirits in our bodies are not a celestial substance, as some have thought. For 1. The Heavens are not subject to generation and corruption as these are. 2. The Heavens are a quintessence, but these are elementary or aerial. 3. The Heavens cannot be diminished, which they must needs be if our spirits be heavenly bodies; for they are as they say, pieces of that great body, which at last will be quite spent, except they be repaired either by a new addition, or by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uniting of the same spirits to it again. 4. Seeing the Heavens have but one motion which is circular; how can any part therof come down into our bodies, except it hath also a strait moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? 5. Gravity and levity are elementary qualities, whereof the Heaven is not capable, and therefore cannot descend. 6. Our spirits must either be united to the bodies of the Heavens, and so continuated bodies with them, or else separated and divided; both which are absurdities. 7. These spirits did either move
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:57373:21"/>
them selves downward, or else they had some other mover; the first we cannot grant, except wee make the celestial bodies, living creatures, for only such move themselves; neither can we grant the second, except we know what this mover should be; it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be natural, for the motion is violent; nor can the mover be violent, for the work of generation is natural; it remains then that these spirits are aerial in their nature and substance, but the instruments of the soul in regard of their function, in which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard only we consider them as they are in our bodies; for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny actions proceed from them, as they are the souls instruments, which cannot be effected by the air, as air.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. The natural or primogenial heat in living creatures, is not a substance made up of seed and menstruous bloud, as <hi>Galen</hi> thought: For, 1. In Trees and Herbs there is this naturall héat, yet no menstruous bloud; in insects begot of putrified matter, there is this heat, but neither seed nor the foresaid bloud. 2. This heat must diffuse it self through all the least parts of the body, without which they cannot live; but if it be a body, there must be penetration of bodies; if there bee this diffusion; if there be only an agglutination of this heat to the parts of the body, then these parts have not life in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and consequently neither nutrition, or attraction which are the effects of life, and by which it is preserved, and so the Fibres which are given for attraction are in these parts in vain. 3. If this body of our natural heat did live before it was arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated and distinguished into membe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s, then the heart is not the first thing that liveth; besides it will follow, that the soul may be the act of an inorganical body, which is against the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of the soul. 4. Nor can the bloud in the veins be this body, because this bloud is the effect of concoction and nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and it is bloud only: but that body of <hi>Galens,</hi> is the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of generation, and the mixture of seed and bloud. 5. If this natural heat hath no life in it, then it will follow that the chief part of the living creature is without life. 6. This heat then is a quality, in children more vigorous and intense then in men, because its work in these is only to concoct and nourish; but in those to extend the body also, which is a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter work, and therefore requires more heat. Besides, children cannot endure hunger so well as men, because their heat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing greater wastes the bodie sooner, where it hath not food to work upon: children then are more hot intensively, but men extensively, because their bodies are larger, according to the dimension of which, their heat is diffused. And although
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:57373:22"/>
they can eat harder and more solid meats then children, it ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues not that their heat is greater then that of childrens, but that their instruments of mastication (which is the first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction) are better and stronger.</p>
                     <p n="5">V. That mans body might be a fit habitation for the Soul, it was made of all bodies the most 1 temperate, and 2 propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable, 3 the most copious of organs, so that it may well be called a Microcosm, containing as in an epitome, the parts of the great world. 4. It was also made naked, as needing no other arms or defence, then what man was by his reason, tongue and hands, able to furnish himself with. 5. It was made not of an heavenly, but of an elementary substance, because man was made for knowledge, this is got by the senses; these are groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on the proportion of the 4 prime qualities, of which the Heavens are not capable. 7. It was made strait that 1 man may be put in minde of his original that he came from heaven in respect of his soul! 2 That he might affect and seek after the things above, not here below. 3. He abounds more in spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and heat then other creatures, and the heat and spirits raise the body upwards towards their own proper place. 4. If man had not been of a strait body, his hands which were made for many excellent uses, must have been hindred, and employed with the feet, for motion and supporting of his body. 6. Hee was made with long feet, that his body might be the more steddy and strongly supported: with feet forward, because all his actions and motions tend that way. 7. He was not made with wings to fly, because he had hands to make him fly on the water in ships; and he had knowledg to make him fly to Heaven in contemplation; with the wings of Faith we can fly swifter &amp; farther, then <hi>David</hi> could have don with the wings of a Dove.</p>
                     <p n="6">VI. Mans head is of all parts in the body the noblest, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is placed in the highest Region, and nearest Heaven, which it resembleth both in figure and use; it is almost round, 1. That it may be the more capacious of spirits and of brain, of which is more in man then in any other creature, because in him is more variety, and perfection of animal spirits then in other creatures. 2. That it may bee the fitter for motion. 3. That it might be the stronger and more able to resist inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. Again for use: It is like Heaven, for this is the seat of the Angels or Intelligences, and that is the seat of the Intellect; so far forth, as it is the seat of the phantasie by which the intellect worketh, and of the senses by which the phantasie is informed. And as all sublunary bodies receive life,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57373:22"/>
sense, or motion from the Heavens, so do all our members from the Head; so that if our brain be wounded, sense and motion in the body presently cease. The head is that by which man is Lord over the beasts, therefore deserved to have the highest place in the body: it is the Citadel of this little world, in the safety of which consisteth the safety of the body; therefore hands, feet, arms, and all, are ready to protect the head when it is in danger. Hence anciently the head and brains were hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red above the other members: they used to swear by the head, [<hi>per caput hoc juro, per quod pater ante solebat.</hi>] When any snee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, they were wont to blesse them with a prayer, because the brain is affected in sneezing. Men use to uncover their heads to their superiours, intimating that they discover and present to their service the noblest part of their bodies; and for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours sake the Priest abstained from eating of the brains.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>THE Animal and Vital Spirits are so called, not only because we have sense and life by them, but also because they first have life and animation in themselves; for otherwise how could the soul give life and sense to the body by these which are not (as some think) capable of either. 2. These spirits are parts of our bodies, parts, I say, not solid and containing, but fluxil and contained. 3. They are one with the vessels &amp; members, to which they do adhere; one, not specifically, but quantitatively; so the grisle is one with the bone that ends in the grisle. 4. These spirits are not the same with the vapours that are in our bodies: For the vapours are excrements, and hurtful to us, therefore nature strives to expel them; but the spirits are parts, &amp; helpful to us, therfore nature labors to retain them. 5. These spirits som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times are extinguished by violence, somtimes are wasted for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of food and maintenance; he that is drowned hath his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits extinguished, he that dieth of sicknesse, hath his spirits wasted. Thus the flame in the candle by the wind is extinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by the defect of wax it is wasted: the quantity remains in that, it is lost in this.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. The Animal, Vital, and Natural spirits are distinct in their
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:57373:23"/>
originals; for the animals are from the brain, the vital from the heart, the natural from the liver. 2. In their Vessels; for the animal are in the nerves, the vital in the arteries, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural in the veins. 3. In their operations; from the animal we have sense and motion; from the vital, life; from the natural auction and nutrition. 4. The vital spirits remain when the animal and natural are gone. In a Palsie there is neither sense nor motion; in an Atrophy there is neither auction nor nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition; and consequently, neither animal, nor natural spirits, and yet there is life and vital spirits. 5. The Natural spirits are in every part of the body, so are not the Animal and Vital, but in their proper vessels. 6. The motion of the Animal spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits is voluntary, and in our power, so is not the motion of the other spirits. 7. The Animal spirits rest in sleep, the Vital and Natural are then most active. 8. The Animal spirits are subject to fatigation and cessation, the others not. 9. In Vegitables there are Natural and Vital spirits, but not Animal; in imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Animals there are all three, but grosser and colder, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not so apt to be dissipated.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. That there is no active seed in the female for generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but that she is meerly passive, in furnishing only the Matter or Menstruous bloud with the place of conception, is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Aristotle</hi> manifest; because if the females seed were active, she may conceive of her self without the help of the male, seeing she hath an active and a passive principle, to wit, seed and bloud; and where these principles are, there will be action and passion. If the <hi>Galenists</hi> object, that the females seed is colder then the males, and therefore not procreative without it; I answer, That though it be colder then the males, yet it is hotter then the bloud, and therefore active, the bloud being meerly passive. Again, the heat of the males seed is but an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, no ways concurring essentially to generation, but only by way of fomenting and cherishing the females seed, as the heat of the Hen doth to the generation or production of the Partridg; wheras the whole power and faculty of generation, was in the Egg, not in the Hen: &amp; so by this opinion, the males seed affords nothing but heat or fomentation. 2. If the females seed bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, and the males too, it will follow, that two efficients nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merically different, and having no subordination to each other, do produce one effect, which is absurd. 3. It will follow, that there are three material causes, to wit, the males seed, the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males, and the bloud, and therefore must be three forms; for one form hath but one matter. 4. It will follow, that the female
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:57373:23"/>
is perfecter then the male, as having more principles of genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to wit, the seed, the bloud, and the place or matrix. 5. And in this respect, that the male will stand more in need of the female, then she of him, he being more indigent of these prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of generation then she, and having a greater desire to perpetrate the species then she. 6. The <hi>Galenists</hi> are mistaken, in thinking those glandulous substances in the female to bee te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticles containing seed, whereas they are kernels to receive the superfluous moisture of the matrix. 7. The arteries, nerves, and veins, are not spermatical parts; for of the seed no parts are procreated, but they are sanguineal, as the flesh differing from the flesh in this, that being cut, they do not unite again, as the flesh, because of their hardnesse and drinesse, and want of that moisture which is in the flesh. 8. The males seed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing received into the menstruous bloud, doth evaporate and turn into spirits, animating the informed masse. 9. The child sometimes resembleth the Father, sometimes the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, according to the predominancy of the seed or the bloud. 10. As the bloud nourisheth the nerves, veins, &amp;c. so it may be transformed into them. 11. The bloud may be called seed, because the seed is begot of it; and as in Vegitables, Hearbs and Trees are begot of seed, so in animals, procreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is of the bloud. Hence Christ is called the Seed of the Woman.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. The <hi>Adeps</hi> or fat in our bodies is generated, not by heat, for heat dissolves and melts it. 2. Coldest temperaments are fattest, as Women are fatter commonly then men, in Winter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> creatures are fatter then in Summer, in cold more then in hot Climats men are fatter; <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> are fatter then <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi> or <hi>Spaniards.</hi> 3. Fat adheres only to the colder parts, as the membranes: Nor is it generated by cold; For, 1. No part of our body is actually cold, but hot. 2. The Kidneys and heart, which are very hot, have far adhering to them. 3. Melancholy men, and old men, who are cold, have little or no fat. It remains then, that the <hi>Adeps</hi> is begot of a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate heat, which in respect of a greater heat may be called cold; as the brain in respect of the heart. And nature hath placed the fat next to the cold membranous parts, for cherish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them; so the far of the Cawle was chiefly ordained for fomenting of the stomach, which is oftentimes
wasted by the excessive heat of the liver. Hence it is, that a hot li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is accompanied with a cold stomach: for the hot liver like a cupping glafse, sucks and draws the heat of the neighbouring parts to it.</p>

                        <pb n="30" facs="tcp:57373:24"/>V. When we consider the cold flegm with which the lungs are still infested. 2. The office of them, which is to refrige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the heart. 3. Their colour, which is whitish; we would think that they were of a cold constitution. On the other side, when we 1. look upon their light and spongy substance; 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> on their office, which is to temper and warm the cold air, that it may not offend the heart: 3. On their nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment, which is the cholerick or bilious bloud, we would think they were hot of constitution; and indeed so they are, and cold only by accident, by reason of the external air, and water from the brain, and other parts.</p>

                     <p>THE Heart hath divers prerogatives above other members: 1. It is the Fountain of our natural heat. 2. Of the Vital spirits, from whence the Animal have their Original. 3. It is placed in the midst of the breast. 4. It is the first that lives, and the last that dies. 5. It is of that absolute necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that the welfare of the sensitive creature depends on it; therefore Nature preserves it longest from diseases, and as soon as the heart is ill-affected, the body droopeth. 6. Sensitive creatures can live<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> some without Lungs, some without a Spleen, some without Kidneys, some without a Gall, some without a Bladder, but none can live without the Heart, or something answering to the Heart, as bloudless animals. 7. The Heart is admirable in its motions, if either we consider the manner or perpetuity thereof, or that it is of it self not depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding upon our will or pleasure.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. The actions of our members, depend originally from the temperament of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>imular parts; but in respect of perfection and consummation, from the conformity and right situation of the Organ, so the temperament of the Chrystalline humor is the efficient cause of sight; but the situation and confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the parts of the eye, is the perfecting or consumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting cause: For if the Chrystalline, or other parts of the eye,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:57373:24"/>
were otherwise situated, we should either not see <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>o well, or not at all.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. That there are no spermatical parts, as Nerves, Bones, Veins, &amp;c. but sanguineal only, is plain by these reasons, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>. To make more material causes then one, is to multiply entities needlesly, whereas the menstruous bloud is sufficient matter for all the parts; which because it is the matter of our bodies, it had an inclination, disposition, or potentiality to all parts: and because the work to be produced, was Heterogenious, and the form heterogenious, therefore the matter had an heteroge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious potentiality, as well to those parts which the Physitians call spermatical, as to the sanguineal. 2. I would know which be the spermatical parts of an Egge: not the white; for of that they grant the whole Chick is formed: not the yelk; for that is, they say, the food of the Chick, and yet we see the Chick hath bones, and other spermatical parts, as they call them. If then Bones and Nerves are no seminall parts in a Chick, neither are they in a Childe, the reason being alike in both. 3. The spermatical parts are nourished by the blood, then doubtless they were generated of blood: for [<hi>iisdem nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimur ex quibus constamus</hi>] and there can be no nourishment without transition and transinutation of the blood into the parts nourished. Now to say, that the blood which nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth these parts, becomes seed, or spermatical, is to employ the testicles in continual working of seed for nutrition of the spermatical parts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how can so much seed be generated, and by what vessels shall they be carried to the upper parts of the body. 4. The heart and liver are sanguineal parts: then doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less the nerves, arteries, and veins which are from them, bee sanguineal.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. The Bones, Nerves, Arteries, Veins and Grissles being cut or broke, are not so easily re-united as the fleshy parts: not because they are spermatical, but because they are harder and drier then the fleshy: for in children, while they are soft and moist, they are easily reunited; and the Veins which are softer then the Arteries, are sooner healed: for the hardness, thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and perpetual motion of the Arteries, hinder its coaliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 2. Likewise where there is defect of natural heat, as in old men, these are hardly knit together: For heat is the chief Artificer or Agent in the body. 3. And where there is defect of matter, or radicall moisture, the cure is difficult, as in old men. 4. If there be not a sufficient time given, the cure will never be effected: Thus the heart being woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:57373:25"/>
is never united, because life flieth before the cure can be performed.</p>

The spermatical parts by most are counted colder then the sanguineal; which cannot be: for we find by experience, that there is more heat in the stomach, then in the liver; for it is a greater heat that turns bones, or such hard meats into a liquid substance, then this which turns our liquid substance into another: to wit, the Chylus into blood: If it be obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, that those creatures, whose stomachs are incompassed with flesh concoct best: I answer, it is true, not because the flesh is hotter then the stomach, but because it keeps in the heat: thus though our cloaths keep in our heat, no man will say, that they are hotter then we; for this cause our bones and nerves are wrapped about with flesh, and yet these are hotter then the flesh, in their opinion that call them spermatical; for they con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If it be objected, that the seed is hot in respect of its spirits, but cold in respect of its matter: I answer, that if the matter of the seed were not hot, it could not so much abound in spirits, for by the heat the spirits are begot, and not heat by the spirits: therefore when the heat fails, the spirits fail: Hence it is, that the animal spirits in the nerves move not the hand, when it is benummed with cold: but let the hand be warmed, and then the spirits have life again<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. Those parts which they call spermatical, are more sensible of the cold, and sooner offended by it then the sanguineal parts, and therefore must needs be hotter: for one contrary is most sensible of another: thus are we more sensible of a little cold in Summer, when we are hot, then of a great deal in Winter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Southern people, whose bloods are hot, are sooner offended with cold, then the Northern, whose constitution is colder. 3. The heat of the bladder, which they call a spermatical part, is so great, that it can bake the slimy substance of the urine into a hard stone, which argue
s its heat above the sangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neal parts. Some Physitians answer, that this is done, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the heat, but by reason of the long stay, and slimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the matter: but they must know, that the slimy mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is meerly passive, and that it is the heat which is the agent, and artificer of the stone: as for the long stay, that is but a help, for time is no agent. 4. That the bones are hot, is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest, for they have much fat in them, as we see in bones when they are burned, and a greater heat was required to bring

The brain was not made for the skul, but the skul for the brain, therefore it is like they were formed both together, and that the skul was proportioned to the bigness of the brain, and not this to the bigness of the skull. 2. The brain and skull were placed uppermost, for the eyes, which were to be neer the brain, because of the spirits: and optick nervs, which by reason of their softness, were fittest to be implanted in the eye, otherwise they had been too hard; for the nerve is har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as it is farther from the brain: and no place was so fit for the eyes, which were to watch over the body, as the upper place; neither could the eyes be so secure any where, as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in these concavities of the skull. 3. The skull being a bone, feeleth not, for bones have no other sense, but what is in the membrans or <hi>Periostium</hi>; neither can there be sense, but where there be nerves, but there be none in the bones: except in the teeth, which therefore feel, because the nerves are incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated in them, and communicate the sensitive spirits to all parts of them, and the sensitive faculty with them: yet they are more sensible of the first, then of the second qualities. 4. The teeth are still growing, because there is continual need of them, and are harder then other bones, because they were made to bruise hard meats. 5. They are more sensible and sooner offended with cold then with heat; and yet heat is the more active quality, which sheweth, that the constitution of the teeth is hot, for if they were cold, they should not bee so soon troubled with cold, being a friendly quality.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">I. THERE are in our bodies two sorts of blood, the one arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, begot in the heart, for the exciting of our heat; the other venal, begot in the liver, for nourishing of the body: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>o according to <hi>Aristotle,</hi> the heart; and according to <hi>Galen,</hi>
                        <pb n="34" facs="tcp:57373:26"/>
the liver may be called the fountain of bloud. 2. As the heart is the first thing that liveth in us, so it must needs be first nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished, for life cannot be without nutriment, &amp; nutriment can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be without blood, therefore there must needs be blood in the heart before there was any in the liver. 3. As the heart first liveth, so it first operates, for life consists in operation: but the proper work of the heart is to beget arterial blood and vital spirits, therefore the blood was first in the heart. 4. Though blood resemble the liver in colour, it will not therefore follow that blood hath its first original from the liver, but only that it is the receptacle and cystern of blood; so the bag, in which the gall lieth, hath the same colour with the gall, and yet this is generated in the liver, and onely contained in the bag; and its a question, whether the liver coloureth the blood, or the blood the liver. 5. In fear and sadness, the blood retires in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the heart, which is by means of the spirits recoiling thither with the blood, as to their original. 6. In the brain we finde four sensible concavities for the animall spirits; in the heart two, for the blood and vital spirits; but in the liver none, for the blood; in the resticles none, for the seed; nor in the breast for the milk; which makes me doubt, whether the blood, seed, and milk, have any concoction in these parts, if they have, it must be surely in a very small quantity. 7. I finde pure blood no where but in the heart and veins; by which I gather that there must be a greater commerce between the heart and veins, then some doe conceive, which appears also by the implanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>vena cava</hi> in the heart, which cannot be separated without tearing of the heart or vein; and that either the blood is perfected in the heart, and prepared in the liver, or else prepared in the heart, and perfected in the liver: besides, that the arteries doe all along accompany the veins.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. I see no reason why we may not affirm, that the heart is continually in its <hi>Diastole,</hi> drawing blood out of the <hi>vena cava</hi>; and in its <hi>Systole</hi> or contraction, refunding blood into the same vein: for this continual motion of the blood, is no more impossible then the continual motion of the heart and arteries; neither is it more absurd for perfect and imperfect blood to bee mingled in this motion, then for cholerick, melancholick and flegmatick blood, to be mingled with pure blood in the veins. 2. When the liver is vitiated, sanguification faileth, and so hydropsies follow, which doth not prove that the liver is the sole cause of sanguification, but that it is subordinate to the heart: so when the Chrystalline humour is vitiated, the sight
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:57373:26"/>
faileth, and yet this humour is not the sole cause of fight, but is subordinate to the op<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ick nerve and spirits. The heart then by the liver distributes blood to the members. 3. The veins have their radication in the liver, their office and distribution from the liver and the heart: their original from neither<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of matter, but in respect of efficiency from the heart; for this first liveth, and therefore the fittest place for the forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive faculty to reside in.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. The <hi>Chylus</hi> is turned into blood, not by the substance of the Liver, for the <hi>Chylus</hi> comes not neer it, and there can be no alteration or concoction without contact: nor by the veins, for their office is to convey and distribute the bloud, not to make it. So the arteries doe not make the arterial blood, which they convey: besides tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> the form, temperament, and colour of the blood is far different from that of the veins; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the blood is made by the power of that celestial heat by which we receive life, growth, and nutriment: for the same heat produceth divers effects in the divers subjects it works up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; in the stomach it turns our meat into a white <hi>Chylus</hi>; in the veins into red blood: in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>eminal vessels into seed, in the breasts into milk, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. The same Meseraick veins which draw the purest pare of the <hi>Chylus</hi> from the intestins, that it might there receive sanguification, contain also pure blood, which the intestines draw for their nutriment, for every part draws that food which it most delights in. Thus from the same mass of blood, the Spleen draws melancholy, the gall choler, the kidneys, water.</p>
                     <p n="5">V. The <hi>Peripateticks</hi> will have the heart to be the first ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of the nerves, and of the sensitive motion: The <hi>Galenists</hi> will have the brain; but this contention is needless: For the heart is the first principle, because it is the first that lives and moves, whereas the brain moves not but by the heart. In a Syncope, or swowning fit of the heart, all sense and motion suddenly fail, which could not be if these had not their origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal from the heart: the brain may be called the secondary or subordinate caus or principle: for this by its cold, tempers the vital spirits, and so they become sensitive or animal. Hence it is that in an Apoplexy there is a sudden failing of sense and motion. If any say, that the body can move after the heart is taken out, and that therefore the heart cannot be the first prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of motion: I answer, so can the body move after the head is off, as wee see in Poultry. This motion then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes neither the head nor heart from being originals: for
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:57373:27"/>
it is caused by the remainder of the spirits, which are left in the nerves and arteries. As for the Apoplexy, I take it to bee an affection, not of the brains alone, but of the nerves also.</p>
                     <p n="6">VI. The common opinion is, that the nerves are the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments of sense and motion: and yet we see sense and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion where there are no nerves: for in every part of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy there are not nerves, and yet every part feels and moves: this sense and motion must needs proceed from the spirits in the blood, which is in every part of the flesh and skin, where there are no veins. If it be replyed, that upon the obstructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or binding of the nerve, sense and motion fail: I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, the like failing there is of sense and motion, when the arteries called <hi>Carotides,</hi> are bound up; for as the animal spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits will not work without the vital, neither will the spirits in the blood and flesh work, if they fail which are in the n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rves, such is the union amongst them, that this failing, all action ceaseth.</p>
                     <p n="7">VII. Seeing the sensitive and motive Spirits differ not specifically, there is no need why wee should assign different nerves to sense and motion; for the same neve serves to both; it is true, that there be some hard, some soft nerves, because some have their original from the soft brain, and some from the harder pith of the baek bone; and that the soft nerve is fittest f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">I. ALTHOUGH the nerves are not sensibly pervious as the Veines and Arteries are, which were purposely made hollow for the passage of the venal and arterial blood; yet the animall spirits being subtil and sublimated bodies can free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly passe through the soft and spungy substance thereof, as wel as sweat through the pores of the skin. 2. Though in the Palsie the animal spirits cannot passe through the thick, clam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my and glassy flegme, which by reson of its coldnesse, deads the spirits, which without the natural heat, have no vigour or motion, yet they can freely passe through the nerves by help of the native heat. 3. Though the spirits by reason of their specifical form or aeri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>l nature should only move upward, yet as they are instruments of the soul, they move which way the soul will have them move. 4. Though no grosse body can move in an instant, yet their spirits can, being moved by the soul immediatly, and being such sublimate and subtil bodies, that they come neer to the nature of spirits. 5. Though in sleep the senses are tied up, yet there is ofte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times motion; as we see in those that walk and talk in their sleep, and yet feel not; because the fore ventricles of the brain are affected, in which is the common sense, so is not the pith in the back, from which the most of the motory nerves have their original. 6. In one and the same nerve oft<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>times motion faileth, and the sense remaineth, because more spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are required, and greater force for motion being an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then for sense, which consisteth in reception or passion. 7. Sense doth sometimes fail, the motion remaining sound; when the nervous branches which are inserted into the skin, are hurt or ill-affected, at the same time the nerves inserted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the muscles may be sound.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. In phrensies the motion is strong, but the sense weak; because the braines being inflamed, the nerves are heated
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57373:28"/>
and dried, therefore fitter for motion, but the lesse apt for sense, which requireth a soft nerve. 2. In the falling sickness sense faileth, but not motion, because the fore ventricles of the brain being ill-affected, the common sense is intercepted; but the pith of the back bone from whence the most nerves are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, is not hurt, therefore motion not hindred. 3. In lepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies the sense is dulled, but not the motion, because the nerves and skin are dried, by which sense is hindred, but not motion. 4. In a deep sleep or Caros, there is respiration without sense, because the fore-part of the brain is hurt, but not the nerves and muscles of the breast. 5. Oftentimes the eye lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth its sight, but not its motion, because the optick nerve by which we see, is not the same with the nerves, by which the eye is moved.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. All spontaneous motions are caused by the spirits in the brains, nerves and muscles in the creatures that have them, but where these organs are not, the animal spirits move the body without them, as we see in worms. 2. All muscles are not the organs of voluntary motion: for the three little muscles with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ears move them not to hear when we please, for many times wee hear what wee would not. 3. In those parts where there be nerves without muscles, there is no voluntary moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, because the nerves convey only the spirits, which the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scles receive, and by them immediately move the body. 4. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration in sleep is a natural, not a voluntary motion, caused notwithstanding by the muscles of the breast. 5. Sleep-walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are moved by the muscles, which motion then cannot be vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary, for the walker hath not knowledge of his walking, or of the end thereof. 6. Beasts are moved by their muscles, which motion in them cannot be called voluntary, but sponta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous onely.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. All muscles have not tendones, but such as are appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for a strong and continual motion: hence the muscles of the tongue, bladder, and <hi>anus,</hi> have no tendones. 2. The muscle is moved not onely by the nerves and tendones, but also by the fibres within its own fleshy substance: and indeed the fibrous flesh is the chief instrument of spontaneous moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and where they are wanting, there is no such motion: Hence it is that beasts can move their skins, which men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, because beasts skins adhere close to a fibrous substance, whereas that of mans is nervous; onely the skin of the face in us is movable, because musculous and fibrous.</p>
                     <p n="5">V. Though the substance of the tongue be not a musculous
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:57373:28"/>
or fibrous flesh, yet it receiveth its divers motions from divers muscles. 2. The muscles of the abdomen are chiefly made for pressing of the same, when nature desires to expel the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements, and in the next place to move the breast with the other muscles appointed for respiration. 3. The muscle of the bladder called Sphincter, was made partly for opening a passage for the urine to passe away, which it doth by dilating and extending it self; and partly for shutting up of the blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der by contracting it self, lest the urine should passe from us in sleep, or against our wills whilest we are awaked. 4. The muscle called diaphragma, or the midriff, was made for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration and inspiration; in inspiration, it dilateth it self, but in expiration, it is contracted upward, as we see in dead bodies. 6. The muscles of the ribs called Intercostals, are some of them external, which distend the breast for inspiration, some inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, which contract the breast for exspiration.</p>
                     <p n="6">VI. <hi>Aristotelians</hi> will have the flesh, <hi>Galenists</hi> the skin to be the organ of tact: but I think both are; for I take the skin to be nothing else but the outward superficies of the flesh, a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle dried and hardned; and differing no other way from the flesh, then the outward skin of the apple, from the softer sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance thereof; so then the flesh, both as it is a soft substance, and as it is hardned in its outward superficies, is the organ of tact, by means of the nerves and fibres diffused into it; and whereas vision, hearing, and smelling, have the air for their medium, tact and taste, which are the two absolutely need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full senses, without which we cannot live, (whereas with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the other three we may) have no medium at all.</p>

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:57373:29"/>
but these have none; yet in a large sense they may bee called parts, as they help to make up the whole.</p>

                        <hi>II.</hi> As the Loadstone draweth Iron, and Plants nutriment from the earth, so doth every part of our bodies draw that ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which is most proper for it: some by the help of the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres, as the heart in its <hi>Diastole</hi> draws blood from <hi>Vena cava</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to its right ventricle by the help of the fibres: some without their help, as bones, grissles, and ligaments. So the Intestines draw without fibers, the Chylus from the Ventricle, with which they are delighted; and they draw blood from the Meseraick veins, with which they are nourished; and the same veines draw the purer part of the Chylus from the Intestines for san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guification.</p>

Thus we see in dying people, that expiration is stronger then inspiration, nature being more willing to be rid of hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful vapours, then to receive fresh aire: so when the intestines are affected with inflammations, obstructions, or ulcerations, that they cannot send the excrement downward, they force it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward into the stomach again, and so expel it by the mouth, as in the <hi>Iliaca passio.</hi>

                        <hi>IV.</hi> Such a sympathy and combination there is between the matrix and the head, by reason of the nerves; that when the matrix is ill-affected, the head and brains are ill-disposed; and oftentimes the sensitive, animal, and motive faculties are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown; hence convultions, stupidities, and strange distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances of the imagination. 2. By reason of the arteries, such a sympathy there is between the heart and the matrix, that swouning fits, and suffocation, with a cessation of pulse, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration follow upon the distemper of the matrix. 3. Such a consent there is between the matrix and brests of women, that sometimes blood hath flowed from the breasts instead of milk, and milk hath been voided downward instead of blood. 4.

with the smell the thin vapors are conveyed thither, on which the spirits are fed. 2.

Sweet smels do cause in some women histerical passions, because they stir up the pernitious vapors that lay lurking in the matrix, which vapors are conveyed by the arteries to the diaphragma, heart and brain; whereas by stinking smels nature is stirred up to the expulsion both of them, and withall of the naughty hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors in the matrix. 4. There is a two-fold motion of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix; the one is natural by its straight and circular fibres, so it is moved downward towards the reception of the seed, and expulsion of the childe and secundine: the other motion is convulsive, proceeding from too much inanition or repletion; and sometimes of venomous vapours, whence are suffocations, and want of respiration, the diaphragma being pressed.</p>

The male groweth flower then the female, because he was to live longer; therefore nature proceeds the flower, as we see in trees and plants; a Cherry-Tree groweth up sooner then an Oak, and decayeth far sooner. Besides, the soft and loose flesh of the female is sooner extended, then the solid and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der flesh of the male: We may then conclude, that the male is hotter intensively; but the female by reason she hath more blood, is hotter extensively.</p>

Because the blood is in every part of the body, and the seed is the quintessence of the blood; therefore the seed may be said to be derived from all parts of the body, for all parts of the body consume upon much evacuation of seed; and as it is from all parts, in respect of its material and grosse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>III.</hi> Though the menstruous blood may receive corruption by its long suppression, or by the moisture of some bad humors, yet in sound women, it is as pure as any other blood in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: For it is appointed by nature for nutriment of the infant, whilst it is in the womb; and after birth it is converted into milk, neither doth it differ from other blood in its material and efficient causes; besides that, it is as red, and coagulates as soon, as the purest blood of the body: Neither doth na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture send it away because it is peccant in the quality, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is exuberant in the quantity. 2. By reason the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struous blood is infected with ill humours, on which the child in the womb feeds; hence it is, that there are few or none, but one time or other are infected with the small pox; which as divers other poisons, doth not presently shew it self, but lieth a long time lurking in the body: And if at the first time, the venome of this disease is not thoroughly purged out, it returns: Hence it is, that some have this disease divers times. 3. The menstruous blood is not the cause of the small pox,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:57373:33"/>
whilst it remains in the vessels, but when it is converted into the substance of the body; hence it is, that women whose moneths are stopped, are not infected with this malady. 4. This blood is evacuated once in a moneth ordinarily, at such time as the Moon, which hath dominion over humid bodies, is most prevalent: Nature also observes her own periods, and times of evacuation, of which we can give no reason. But this is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that if the evacuation of this blood were as frequent as of other excrements, there would be no conception.</p>

The false concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion called <hi>Mola,</hi> is begot when the seed is faulty, weak or deficient, and the blood predominant; which is known from a true conception, because there is no milk in the breasts, when there is a false conception, neither doth it move after the fourth moneth, as the child doth; sometimes it is moved by the matrix, but not by it self, as the child: besides it remains after the eleventh moneth, which is the time prefixed for the birth of the child.</p>

                     <p>AS soon as the child groweth big, about the fourth month, the menstruous blood flowes upward to the breasts, and when the child is born, it flowes from thence; and being
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:57373:36"/>
suck'd by the child, the veins of the breasts do avoid vacuity, draw the blood upward for generation of new milk. 2. In the breasts of Virgins, and of some men also, there is sometimes found a whitish liquor, which is not milk, because it hath nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the tast, nor thickness, nor nutritive quality of milk. 3. The breasts, or paps, are glandulous bodies, principally or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained for generation of milk; and in the second place for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of excrementitious humors, and guarding of the heart. 4. The reason why about the fourth month the blood flowes upward into the breasts, is, that the child growing big, and wanting sufficient food, might struggle to get out, which it would not do having sufficient nutriment. 5. It is not fit that the child out of the womb, should feed on blood as it did in the womb, because then the mouth of the veins being open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the blood would run out, and so nature be overthrown; neither would God accustom man to blood, left he should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come cruel and bestial.</p>

This flesh is not musculous, because the motion of the muscles is voluntary, but the hearts motion is natural. 3. The heart hath both straight, transverse, and circular fibers, for attraction and expulsion; and oblique fibers also for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tension; but these fibers are of the same substance with the heart, and not of a different, as the fibers of the Muscles, which are parts of the nerves and Tendons. 4. The heart is fed with gross blood, answerable to its own gross substance, by the vein called <hi>Coronaria,</hi> compassing the Basis of the heart. 5. The heart hath two ventricles, whereof the right is hottest exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> will have it, for it contains the life-blood; the left is hottest intensive, as containing the vital spirits, and so <hi>Galen</hi> saith. 6.

This vital faculty dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from the animal, because it is not subject to fatigation, nor rests in sleep, nor doth it accompany the imagination or appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of the object, as the animal doth. 3. It is different from the pulsifick faculty, because this is subservient to the vital; neither doth the pulsifick beget spirits, or is it diffused every where as the vital is. 4. The vital differs from the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitive faculty, because the vegitive is in plants and insects, but not the vital, as it is procreative of spirits: for the dull heat of insects is not so soon spent as to need reparation by genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of spirits. 5.

The arteries are moved by the spirits of the heart, conveyed by their tunicles rather then their cavity; for up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the pressing of the tunicles the pulse ceaseth; but not when the cavity is stuffed, or stopped.

                        <hi>ARistotle</hi> differs from the <hi>Galenists</hi> about the motion of the Lungs; he will have them moved by the heart, whose heat listeth up the Lungs, upon which motion the air enters for avoiding vacuity; which being entred, the Lungs fall. The <hi>Galenists</hi> will have their motion to depend on the motion of the breast, but both are in the right: For the motion of the Lungs is partly voluntary, and so it depends on the moving of the muscles of the breast; and partly natural, and so it is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the heart. 2. When <hi>Aristotle</hi> denies that the air is the nutriment of the spirits, which the <hi>Galenists</hi> affirm; his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is, that the air doth not properly nourish the spirits, as meat doth our bodies; for there is no assimilation or conversion of the substance of the air into our spirits, which are proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nourished by blood, but only a commixtion of the air and spirits for refrigeration: And indeed if the spirits were properly fed by the air, there would not come out the same air that went in: For the spirits would not part from their food; the air then nourisheth the spirits, as it doth the fire, by refrigerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and preserving it from suffocation.</p>

The species being spiritual or immaterial, do not affect or hurt the eye, but the colours only hurt the eye more or lesse, as they participate more or lesse of the light, which dissipates the visive spirits, these being lucid, spend themselves on lucid objects, by reason of their cognate quality. 3.

Three little bones called <hi>Incus, malleus,</hi> &amp; <hi>Stapes.</hi> 3. An innate and immoveable air. 4. A winding labyrinth, that the external air and sound may not too suddenly rush in upon the nerve of hearing. 5.

Therefore not the brain, nor that part thereof which they call (<hi>processus mamillares</hi>) reaching to the nose, can be the organ of sense, but the nose itself; for they that want the nose, smel not; and a short nose smels not so well as a long<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and if any part of the brain were the organ of smel, we should smel the meats in our mouth, and the vapours of the stomach<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which are still mounting up to the brain: Yet we never smell them till we belch them out, and then we smell them as soon as they ascend into the nose, which is indeed the true organ of smell in that nervous membrane thereof.

The taste hath no external medium as the other three senses, and in this it agreeth with touching. 4. Though sapors work materially upon the tongue, yet the act of sensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is by reception of the species, for real qualities cannot be received into the animal spirits, and judged by the common sense and fantasie.</p>

                        <hi>II.</hi> The sense of tact either hath no medium, or else we must make the skin the medium; and the flesh, membranes and nerves the organ; but indeed the skin is both the organ of tact, as experience shewes; and the medium in respect of the flesh and nerves. 2. The four prime qualities, chiefly heat and cold, are not onely the objects of tact, but agents upon them, by warming and cooling the organs; so are not the second quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to wit, hardness, softness, asperity, &amp;c. For these are not active at all, except levity in a spiritual or intentional way. 3. Though there be many particular objects of tact, as the first and second qualities, yet there is but one general object, to wit, the tactile quality. 4. Though this be true, that the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible object put upon the sense, hindreth sensation, in these sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses that have the air for a medium, yet it is not true in the sense of tact, which hath no such medium. 5. The sensitive crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can subsist without any of the five senses except the tact; because this consisteth in the proportion and harmony of the prime qualities, which if it fail, sense also faileth, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently animality. 6. Of all creatures, the sense of tact is most exquisit in man, because his body is most tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate; but tact consisteth in the temper of the prime qualities. 7. Though taste be accompanied with tact, yet they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct senses both in the organs, media, and faculties; and tact is diffused through all the body, whereas taste is only in the mouth.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>AS there be three actions of the soul, to wit, dijudication, composition, and retention, so there are three internal senses; to wit, the common sense, the fantasie and the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. The common sense apprehends and judgeth the objects of the outward senses, in which, as in the Center all these objects do meet; the eye cannot put difference between colours and smels, but the common sense doth; and though the eye see, yet it doth not know it self to see, that is the work of the common sense; therefore mad men in whom this sense is hurt, see, but perceive it not, nor doe they difference the objects which they fee, but either confound them, or mistake the one for the other. So when the sensitive spirits are imployed by the fantasie, though we see oftentimes the object, yet we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it not. 2. Though the common sense apprehends diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of objects, yet it is but one sense, because its actions in judging or differencing these objects is but one: So the eye hath but one action, though it seeth many objects. 3. The act of judging in the common sense, is not that of the soul, which extendeth it self to things also spiritual and universal, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs only to man, not to the beasts, as the judging of the common sense doth. 4. The external senses apprehend their objects onely present, but the internal senses apprehend them being absent. 5. The common sense is in the brain subjective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for there are the animal spirits and nerves, so saith <hi>Galen</hi>; but in the heart originally, and in its cause; for from thence are the vital spirits, which are the matter of the animal, and so is <hi>Aristotle</hi> to be understood.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <hi>II.</hi> The second internal sense is the imagination, so called from the images or species, which it both receiveth from the common sense, and frameth to it self: If the brain be sound and undisturbed, it receiveth species from the common sense only, and judgeth more distinctly of them then the common sense doth; it compoundeth also and uniteth, and in beasts it serves
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:57373:43"/>
in stead of reason to direct them to their operations; in man it is subservient to the intellect in ministring species to it, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is called phantasie, from <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, to shine, or shew; For as the eye discerns its objects by the light, so doth the intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect whilest it is in the body, work and speculate by the phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasie. 2. In disturbed brains by phrensies, fevers, or inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate sleep, the phantasie makes other objects to its self then were represented to it by the common sense. 3. The phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie compoundeth that which the common sense apprehendeth in a divided way; as I see a horse and a man, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sense apprehendeth the species of both apart; but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them united in a Centaure, is the work of the phantasie. 4. The estimative is not a sense distinct from the phantasie, but the very same, whose office is to esteem what is good or hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the creature, and so to follow or avoid it, therefore this sense stirreth up the appetite. 5. The common sense doth not work but when the outward senses are working; but the fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasie worketh without them, to wit, in sleep. 6. The fore part of the brain, in which is the common sense, is humid, as being fittest for reception, which is the common senses work; the hinder part is dry, as fit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>est for retention, which is the work of the memory: but the middle part is temperately humid and dry, as fittest for reception and retention, both which are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the phantasie. 7. For a right and orderly phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, or imagination, there are required clear spirits from vapors, a temperate organ, straight nerves and passages, and a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate heat from the heart; if any of these bee deficient, the phantasie is disordered.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. The third internal sense is the memory; not so much to be called a sense, as it retaineth the species; (for in this the nature of sensation consisteth not,) but as it receiveth them, for sensation is properly in reception. 2. This sense is the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury, in which are laid up that species of things past, which have been apprehended by the external senses. For as these consider things present, and hope things future; so doth the memory, things past: it is the wax receiving and retaining the stamp of the seal, and it is a faculty of the sensitive, not of the intellective soul; for beasts and birds have memories. As for the intellective memory, it is all one with the passive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect, which is the keeper of the intelligible species; for it belongs to the same faculty to understand and to remember. 3. Though in brutes there is memory, yet recorda<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ion or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniscence is onely in man, because it is joined with discourse
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:57373:43"/>
and deliberation, which are operations of the intellect; for memory is the retention of the species, but reminiscence is a recollecting by discourse and comparing of circumstances, the species which he had forgot; therefore a nimble wit and remi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niscence which consisteth in discourse, go together common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but seldome a good wit and a good memory: this requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a dry organ, the other that which is temperately moist. 4. Children have bad retentive memories, because their brains are moist, and old men have had receptive memories, because their brains are too dry: therefore there is required for me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory a brain temperately moist to receive, and temperately dry to retain the species.</p>

                     <p>HAving briefly discoursed upon the fabrick, parts, and passages of mans body, I will as briefly touch some rare and extraordinary infirmities, with which the bodies of some men have been molested, and will point at such causes, as I conceive may stand with the grounds of Divinity and Philosophy. As for ordinary diseases, with their causes, symptomes, and cures, I leave to Physitians.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. I read in <hi>Cornelius Gemma,</hi> in his Divine characterismes, <hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 4. and in <hi>Marcel.

Thus Bees are begot of Calves flesh, Waspes and Hornets of Horses and Asses, and divers
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:57373:44"/>
sorts of Worms in our bodies.

                     <p n="2">
                        <hi>II.</hi> I read in <hi>Martin Wienrich,</hi> in his book of Monsters, of a woman whose milk did so abound, that in the space of two or three days she voided a gallon and an half, of which was made very savory Butter and Cheese. Though this be rare, yet it is no miracle; for that woman abounding much in blood, must also abound in milk: And some Livers are of that consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution and temper, that they sanguifie much more then others; especially in constitutions that are inclined to cold and moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture; for hot and dry bodies have but little blood, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore little milk; and where there is much sweet flegm, or rhume it is easily converted into blood.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. I read divers stories of women with child, who have lusted after, and have eat mens flesh, and for that end have faln violently upon them, and bit them. This is also a dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>IV.</hi> I read of divers maids, one in <hi>Colen,</hi> another in the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latinate,</hi> a third in the Diocesse of <hi>Spira,</hi> &amp; divers more, who have lived without meat and drink two or three years together. This indeed may seem strange, yet it is not against nature; for na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally such bodies as have in them little heat, and much hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity, can subsist longer without food, then hot and dry bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies can; as we see in women and old people, who can fast longer then men and youths. And we know, that divers crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures for many moneths together, can subsist without

food: therefore these maids having much adventitious moisture and little heat to waste the radical humidity, might continue a long time without food; for where there is little deperdition, there needs not much reparation: besides, the moisture of the air is no small help to them.</p>

But I suppose that he was not altogether without a brain: For that water which was found within the membrans of the skull, when his head was dissected, was doubtlesse his brain converted into water, or else it had some analogy with the brain, by which the heat of the heart was for a while <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For I have read of one whose heart being opened, there was found in it a white worm with a sharp beck, which being placed on a table, and a circle of the juice of Garlick made about it, died, being overcome with that strong smell; by which it is plain, that the use of Garlick is wholesome and needful for such as are subject to worms, as being their destroyer.</p>

                        <hi>II.</hi> Some take the night-mare or <hi>Incubus</hi> for a spirit, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is a feculent humor adhering to the vitall parts, and with its black or melancholy fume troubling the Diaphrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, Lungs, and Brain, and distempering the imagination with horrid shapes.</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <hi>III.</hi> Nature is very skilfull and provident in helping her self when art faileth; for many diseases have been cured by nature, which the Physitians have been forced to give off. <hi>Zacutus Obs.</hi> 15. mentioneth one who being every month vexed with a terrible <hi>Vertigo,</hi> which for a time made him stupid and senseless, was cured by a flux of blood gushing out of his eyes, without any inflammation at all, or redness of the eyes; by those veins that fed the eyes, nature found out a way to ease her self, which veines were opened by the violent motion of the spirits in the head, and the aboundance of blood pressing into those veins, which made an eruption.</p>
                     <p n="4">
                        <hi>IV.</hi> And it is no less strange what he records, <hi>Obs.</hi> 72. of one, upon the tip of whose tongue was found a stone as big as a filbert nut, which grew there within a swelling caused by a great flux, doubtless of slimy matter into that part, and baked into that consistence by a preternatural heat; for he was much subject to Catharrs.</p>
                     <p n="5">
                        <hi>V.</hi> That is not incredible which is recorded by <hi>Iaubert</hi> in his <hi>Vulgar Errors, l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 2. of young women, who have been brought to bed at nine or ten years of age, for nature is more pregnant and forward in some then in others; this we see in some trees, and other vegitables; but these women give off child-bearing betimes, to wit, about one or two and twenty: for, [<hi>quod cito sit cito perit</hi>] and as we say, soon ripe, soon rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; for such hasty and precipitate works of nature are not permanent: hence it is that women who sooner attain to their
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:57373:47"/>
growth then men, decay sooner then men.</p>
                     <p n="6">
                        <hi>VI.</hi> For stones to be bred in the Lungs, which are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the causes of drie coughs, is no great wonder, for divers times such stones have been voided by coughing: but for a mans body to be converted into a stone, as is Recorded in the memorials of <hi>Lyons</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> is more strange, yet not impossible, and therefore the conversion of <hi>Lots</hi> wife into a Salt Pillar is not incredible, although this was the sole work of God. Neither is that incredible which is written of the lake that turns the sticks cast into it, into stones: nor that Cave in <hi>Scotland,</hi> where the water-drops are turned to stones; I have kept an apple til it grew to that hardness, that no wood could be harder, for scarce could a knife cut it. I wil not say this was a perfect stone into which this body was thus turned, but it might be as hard and drie as a stone; for the bodies that are found in the sands of <hi>Egypt,</hi> are very dry and hard.</p>
                     <p n="7">VII. <hi>Horstius,</hi> and others record divers examples of sleep-walkers, who do strange things in their sleep; but this is also the work of nature; for I finde that they are most subject to this infirmity, whose animal spirits are most active, subtil and fiery; and whose imagination is strong; so that by the strength of their fantasie, and agility of their spirits, the muscles are moved, though the Will doth not then concur to this motion, nor reason make any opposition, which it would do if they were naked, and not suffer them to undergo such dangers.</p>
                     <p n="8">VIII. I have read divers Stories of women who have had seaven children and more at a birth, and likewse of superfeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; both which are credible, and possible in nature, as I have shewed in the former book, <hi>c.</hi> 13. <hi>sect.</hi> 5. <hi>&amp;</hi> 7. But that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant should crie in the mothers womb, as some have done, is more strange; seeing it doth not breath, neither is there any air in the matrix, without which there can be no sound; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore either this crie was imaginary in the party that heard it, for sometimes we think we hear a sound when we hear none; or else this sound might proceed from wind in the mothers womb, which might resemble the crying of a child, or else these mothers might be ventriloque.</p>
                     <p n="9">IX. That may seem a miracle which is recorded by Monsieur <hi>Iohn Alibaux</hi> a Physitian, of a woman of <hi>Sens</hi> in <hi>Bourgundie</hi> which went 28 years with a dead child in her womb; this wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man being dead, and her belly opened, there was found a stone having all the limbs and proportion of a child of 9 months old. This was no miracle, but an extraordinary work of nature;
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:57373:47"/>
for the child being dead, and the slimie matter of its body ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving an aptitude by the extraordinary heat of the matrix to be hardned, might retain the same lineaments which it had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; If any wonder, how within the soft and liquid humors of the matrix, such a hard substance should be ingendred; let him as well wonder at the generation of hard bones within soft flesh, of hard stones within soft plums, Peaches, and other fruits, of stones and hard thunder-bolts within watrish clouds.</p>

                     <p>I Have read of divers bodies of men without lungs, and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it; for oftentimes the lungs are putrified and corroded with corrupt and acrimonious matter, and wasted with burning heat; but hence it will not follow, that a man can live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out lungs any time, seeing the heart stands in need continually of refrigeration; yet some do live a great while with half of the lungs, after the other half is putrified and spit out.</p>
                     <p n="2">II.

                     <p n="3">III.

the sick partys have recovered: Nay, I have read of some who have had worms crawle out at their navels: and some whose organs of voice and speech having been assaulted and hurt by worms, have become speechless; how carefull then should we be of our diets, not to delight so much as we do in sweet meats, sauces, and drinks, or in such food as breeds sl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>IV.</hi> That maids have become boyes, I have read in divers Stories: but I have shewed in the former Book, that there is no such change in nature, because the organs of generation in the two sexes, differ, both in number, form, and situation: and that therefore such transformations are meant of Hermaphrodites, or of such boyes, in whom the vessels of generation have not at first appeared outwardly for want of heat and strength, which afterwards have thrust them out. Dr. <hi>Brown</hi> admits the change, and yet shews that the vessels are different, both in form and situation, which is a contradiction.</p>

                        <hi>V.</hi> That there have been Giants, and men of stupendious stature in all ages, is not to be doubted, seeing there are so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny witnesses extant: and the reason of their bigness can be none else, but the aboundance of seed and menstruous blood of which they are begot, the quality and pliableness of the matter, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

What force the imagination hath in women, to make im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of the things imagined on the tender infant in the womb, is known by many Stories, and daily Examples: Hence it is that so many children are born with such variety of strange shapes and marks. Besides, we know how forcible the phantasie, is, both in curing and procuring of diseases; yea, oftentimes of death. Thus one having eat of a Rabbit pie, imagining she had eat of a cat, fel a vomiting and died. Another having passed over a dangerous bridg in the dark, and returning the next day to look upon the place, was struck with such an horror, that he went home and died. A third being in jest made believe that he must lose his head, swouned and fel down dead. Multitudes of such Examples th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Another wil not piss for fear he should drown the world: And many more such strange conceits are some men troubled with by reason of their ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations which are distorted by the black and malignant fumes that disturb the animal spirits, subservient to the phantasie. Such are the imaginations of those who think themselves wolves, and therefore run into the woods, and bite men and cattel they meet with.

The blood of a Bull is grosse, fibrous, stopping, and hard of concoction, and so to weak stomacks may prove accidentally hurtful or deadly, but not to a strong stomack. 3. It may kill even a strong body, if it be taken in too great a quantity, and so may any meat, and the best wines in this respect prove poisonable. 4. If mans blood were poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable, then <hi>Catalin</hi> and his companions had been poisoned, when they dranke mans blood at the taking of their solemne Covenant against the State, as <hi>Salust</hi> shews.

This is not unlikely; for if after a fever, or other great sicknesse, nature recovers her lost beauty, vigour, colour, and decayed spirits and senses, why may not she doe the like in some people, seeing there is not in old age, a total privation of these perfections there, but a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay; and we may observe, that many who are old, weak and sickly, when they are young, are young, lusty, and healthy, when they grow old.</p>

                        <hi>FAllopius</hi> in his Anatomical Observations, (<hi>l.</hi> 1.6.) writes, that he hath found three Spleens in one man, <hi>Gemma</hi> in his <hi>Cosmocritick</hi> speaks of two Spleens that he found; and hee writes of one who had the Spleen in the right side, and the Liver in the left, in <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>Cyclognomonick, p.</hi> 75.

But this man was possessed with madnesse, whose brain being heated with adust melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, did beget animal spirits without much wasting of them.

                        <hi>IV.</hi> The effects of the <hi>Tarentula</hi> in mens bodies are strange and various, and no lesse strange is the cure: for their sting and poison cause some to laugh, some to weep, some drowsie and stupid, and some jovial and merry: These divers effects must proceed from the diversities of poison that is in them: for it seems these venomous creatures are not all of one kind; or els these doe proceed from the different constitutions and tempers of those men that are stung with them: Thus we see what different effects drunkennesse doth cause in men, and so doth musick; but whether this poisonable humour be cured by the musick, or by their dancing, and labour, by which the pores are opened, and the poison by sweat expelled, is questionable; but I think by both; for even in musick, there is great power over the minde and affections, and consequently over the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases and humours, which are mitigated or exasperated accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the minde and affections. This we see in <hi>Sauls</hi> melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, which was cured by <hi>Davids</hi> Harp. Such force there was in <hi>Timothy</hi> the <hi>Milesian,</hi> that when he pleased he could by the power of his musick, make <hi>Alexander</hi> take up and lay downe Arms.

I could alledge many other strange qualities of men, as of one who could move his ears like an Horse, of another whose spittle was poison, and of one who never laughed, &amp;c. but these are sufficient to let us see the power and wisdome of God, and the dexterity of his Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid Nature, both in the fabrick and divers temperaments of mens bodies.</p>

These wretched people die all of one disease, much like our lousie sicknesse: A little before their death, their bodies grow scabby and itchy, so that with scratch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, bloody matter and ugly lice of divers shapes, with wings, swarm out of their belly first, then from other parts, so that they pine away and die in great pain. This disease doubtlesse proceeds partly from the corruption of the aire, and partly from the unwholesomnesse of their diet, which turns to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid humours in their bodies, whence the disease is Epidemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal. This vermin breeds most in those who are given to sweat, to nastinesse, and abound with putrified humours, between the flesh and skin, whose constitutions are hot &amp; moist, as children; and according as either of the four humours are predominant, so is the colour of lice, some being red, some white, some brown, some black; sometimes they burst out of all parts of the body, as in <hi>Herod,</hi> and in that <hi>Portugal,</hi> of whom <hi>Forestus</hi> speaks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> [<hi>l.</hi> 4. <hi>de vitiis capitis</hi>] out of whose body they swarmed so fast, that his two men did nothing else but sweep them off, so that they carried out whole baskets full. Sometimes they breed but in some parts onely, as in the head or arm-pits. <hi>Zacuta</hi> mentioneth one who was troubled nowhere but in his eie-lids, out of which they swarmed in great numbers. Some have voided them by boils and imposthumes. <hi>Forestus</hi> speaks of one who had them only in his back, whom he advised to hold his naked back so close to the fire, till it blistred, out of which blisters they came, and so he was cured. Salt is an enemy to them, yet they are bred in those <hi>AEthiopians</hi> by the frequent eating of the salt lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>custs: But perhaps it is not the eating of the salt meat so much, as the nastinesse, and sweat, unwholesom waters, and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted air that breeds them. And it is certain, that wild and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage people are most given to them, because of their carelesse uncleanlinesse, using no other remedy against them, but shirts died with Saffron, which some wilde <hi>Irish</hi> doe wear six months together without shifting. But sometimes this disease is infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the immediate hand of God, as a punishment of sinne

and tyranny. Examples we have in <hi>Sylla, Pherecides, Herod, Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> the second of <hi>Spain,</hi> and others who died of this malady. Now because Locusts are such an unwholesome food, I cannot think that <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> did feed on them; and therefore it is no vulgar error, to hold, that <gap reason="foreign">

And although the <hi>AEthiopians</hi> did eat them for food, yet this is no argument to prove, that <hi>Iohn</hi> did eat them; which is all the reason that <hi>Beza</hi> and <hi>Casaubon</hi> bring to prove their asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: neither can it be proved, that Locusts were a food ever used in <hi>Iudaea</hi>: For <hi>Pelusiota,</hi> who lived an Eremite many years in those Desarts, never knew any such food used there. But whereas they alledge, that in <hi>Levit. [c.</hi> 11. <hi>v.</hi> 22.] Locusts are set down for clean food: I answer with <hi>Munster [on Levit.</hi> 11.22. who though an excellent Hebrician, yet confesseth, that neither he, nor the <hi>Rabbins</hi> themselves, doe know the true meaning or signification of the proper tearms there used. Therefore the Hebrew word <hi>Harbe,</hi> which we translate <hi>Locust,</hi> the Septuagints call <hi>Bruchus,</hi> which is another kind of Insect. And the <hi>French</hi> in their Bibles have left the Hebrew word untranslated. And so did <hi>Luther</hi> before, as not knowing what that word meant, nor the other three Hebrew words. Dr. <hi>Brown</hi> then had done well rather to have reckoned the Baptists eating of Locusts among the Vulgar Errors, then his feeding upon hearbs in the Desart.</p>

                        <hi>III.</hi> There is no flesh so much subject to putrefaction, as mans body, because it abounds in heat and moisture, so that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes some parts of it doe putrifie before the soul leave it, which cannot so long preserve it from corruption, as salt, spices, the juice of Cedar, and other means by which the AEgyptians used to embalm their dead bodies. For indeed heat and sicci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty are enemies to putrefaction; therefore where the ambient air (which is properly moist) is excluded, there the bodies remain unputrified. Hence the bodies which are digged out of the hot and dry sands in Egypt, have there continued many hundreds of years uncorrupted. <hi>Alexanders</hi> body lay many days unburied and unbalmed, yet stunk not, but smelled odoriferous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, because he had dried up the superfluous moisture of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, by continual drinking of strong and fragrant wines. There
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:57373:57"/>
be also some wines that preserve dead bodies uncorruptible, by reason of their cold and exsiccating quality. So we read in the <hi>Indian</hi> stories, that upon the Mountains of <hi>Chily,</hi> bodies have been found dead there, which have many years without corruption continued. The first detectors of those Countries found it so by experience; for many of them were killed by the piercing subtil quality of those winds, and preserved from putrefaction by the excessive drinesse thereof. I have read of Horsemen sitting on Horse-back, with their bridles in their hands, yet dead many months before without any corruption. It is also the opinion of som, that bodies thunder-struck do not putrifie. I am apt to believe, that either they putrifie not at all, or not in a long time, because of the exsiccating quality of the sulphurous vapour which comes from the thunder and lightning. But there is nothing more apt to preserve dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies from corruption, then the juice of Cedar, therefore much used among the Ancients, both in preserving of their books and bodies; which by reason of their extream bitternesse and dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing quality, gives life to the dead, and death to the living, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguishing the temporary life of the body, and in recompence giving it immortality. So then we see that siccity is the main enemy to putrefaction, which is the cause the Peacocks fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The diet also is a great help to further or retard putrefaction; for they that feed plentifully on flesh, fish, or other humid meats, which breed much blood and humours, are apter to putrifie then those who feed sparingly on hard and dry meats. In the siege of <hi>Amida,</hi> by <hi>Sapor</hi> the Persian King, this difference was found; for the <hi>European</hi> bodies, who lay four days un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buried, did in that time so putrifie, that they could scarce be known: but the Persian bodies were grown hard and dry, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of their hard and dry food, having contented themselvs with bread made of <hi>Naesturtiu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

And <hi>Korrimanus (de mirac. mortuorum</hi>) speaks of a dead head so crowned with this hearb, which in the year 1635. being taken out of the grave, was found uncorrupted. And as dead bodies embalmed with spices, are preserved from corruption; so by the fame dead bodies, men are oftentimes preserved alive: for that stuffe which proceeds from them, called by the <hi>Arabians Mumia,</hi> is an excellent remedy against diseases arising from cold and moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture. <hi>Francis</hi> the first carried always some of it about him.

                        <hi>IV.</hi> That the presence of a dear friend standing by a dying man, will prolong his life a while, is a thing very remarkable and true, and which I found by experience: for about tenne years ago, when my aged Father was giving up the ghost, I came towards his beds side, he suddenly cast his eyes upon me, and there fixed them; so that all the while I stood in his sight, he could not die till I went aside, and then he departed. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, the sympathy of affections, and the imagination working upon the vital spirits, kept them moving longer then otherwise they would have done; so that the heart the seat of affection, and the brain the hous of imagination, were loth to give off, and the spirits in them, to rest from their motion, so long as they had an object wherein they delighted. The like I have read of others: And truly the sympathy of affections, and strength of imagination is admirable, when the mind is able to presage the death or danger of a friend though a great way off. This also I found in my self: For once I suddenly fell into a passion of weeping, upon the apprehension I took that my dear friend was dead whom I exceedingly loved for his vertues, and it fell out accordingly as I presaged; for he died about the same hour that I fell into that weeping fit, and we were at that time 60 miles asunder, nor could I tell certainly, that he was dead till two days after. Thus to some the death of friends is presaged by bleeding at the nose, and sudden sadness, by dreams, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other ways, which the learned Poet was not ignorant of when he saith,</p>

The reason of this might be, because the AEgyptians used from their childhood to cut their hair, and to go bareheaded; so that by the Sun their skuls were hardned. Hence it was, that few among them were found bald; but the Persians who wore long hair, and had their heads always covered, must needs have had soft skuls, by reason the humidity was kept in, and not suffered to evaporate, nor the Sun permitted to harden them.</p>

                        <hi>II.</hi> Why dead bodies after the ninth day swim upon the water, may seem strange, seeing till then they lie hid under the water. <hi>Cardan (de subtil. l.</hi> 8.) gives this reason, Because <hi>between the Peritoneum and Omentum flatulent matter is ingendred, as appears by the great swelling of the belly.</hi> Now this flatulent matter is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got of humidity dissolved by heat, which heat is procreated of putrifaction. Besides, we see that putrified bodies, as eggs, fruit, wood, grow light, because their solid parts being consumed, what remains are porous and full of air: for experience teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us, that the more porous and aereal the body is, the lighter it is, and lesse apt to sink; and perhaps may bee the reason why that body which wants the Spleen swimmeth, not being a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous light substance: And those men who have capacious lungs to hold much air, can dive and live longer in the water then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. And surely some people whose bodies are active, subtile, and quick, will not sink so soon as men of duller spirits. Such were the <hi>Thebii,</hi> a people which could not sink; so that it is a vain way to conclude those to be Witches, who do not present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sink. Hence also it is plain, that dead bodies are heavier then living, though Dr. <hi>Brown (of Errors, l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 7.) contradict this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>he found no difference between a Mouse and a Chick being dead and alive, in respect of gravity.</hi> A weak reason to reckon a received truth among his vulgar errors; for though there were no sensible difference in such little animals, which have but few spirits, yet in men which are of a greater bulk, &amp; in whom do abound vital and animal spirits, to say there is no difference of gravity in their life and death, is to contradict sense and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; for every woman that attends upon sick men, knows that they are more pondrous when dead, then when alive, being used
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:57373:59"/>
to lift and turn them. Reason also grounded on experience, teacheth us, that those bodies are lightest in which air is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant; therefore doubtlesse where there is store of such pure and refined air as the spirits are, there must be lesse gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, then where they are vvanting: his Error is grounded on a false supposition, in thinking there is gravity in the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits themselves, because they participate of corporeity, as if gravity v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Besides, if the spirits had any gravity in them, it must follow, that living bodies are heavier then dead carcasses, which is absurd to think. Again, I would know, vvhy inebriated Apoplectical and swouning persons are heavier then others; is it not because their spirits fail, and they resemble dead men? And so in sleep the brother of death the body is heavier; every Nurse that carrieth her child in her arms will tell him this. Why doth a man fall down in his sleep, who stood upright when he was awaked, If he be not heavier then he was? The Scripture acknowledgeth, that even the Apostles eyes vvere heavy vvhen they vvere sleepy. And vvhereas he proveth the spirits to add vveight to the body, becaus <hi>a man that holds his breath is weightier while his lungs are full, then upon expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: And a bladder blown is heavier then one empty.</hi> I answer, that I could never find this experiment true, though I have made trial. 2. It seems to be false, because the blown bladder vvill swim vvhen the empty one sinks. 3. If I should yeild him this, yet his sequel is nought, except he can prove the animal spirits in a mans body, to be as thick and course as the grosse vapour which is blown into the bladder, which is neither air in name nor purity, much less to bee compared to those subtil spirits, vvhich are so pure and apt to vanish, that nature vvas forced to inclose them vvithin the thick walls of the nerves. So likewise the air retained in the lungs, may perhaps add vveight to the body, because the longer it stays there, the more it degenerates into a thick vapour, by reason of the bodies moisture, and so may become ponderous.</p>

The same reason may be given why some are offended with smells which to others are pleasant; so I have read of <hi>Francis</hi> the firsts Secretary, who was forced to stop his nosthrils with bread when there were any apples at table: and so offensive was the smell thereof to him, that if one had held an apple neer his nose, he would fall a bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Marcel.

                     <p>And Cardinal <hi>Carafa</hi> did so abhor the smell of roses, which of all smells is most delightful to man, that during the rose time he durst not go out of his doors, for fear of encountring with that smell; nor did he suffer any to come within his palace that had a rose about him. This I adscribe to the phantasie and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall antiphathy between him and the rose: Such power there is in smells, that the Ancients ascribed a Divinity to
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:57373:60"/>
them; and because good smells do so chear the spirits, hence they were used in Temples both amongst Jews, Gentiles, and Christians. <hi>Homer</hi> describes his <hi>Iuno</hi> by the sweetnesse of her smell, and so doth <hi>Virgil</hi> his <hi>Venus: Ambrosiaeque comae divinum vertice odorem spiravere</hi>; the like doth <hi>Plutarch</hi> his <hi>Isis,</hi> and so doth <hi>Ovid: Mansit odor, possis scire fuisse Deam.</hi> But for the Rose there may be some manifest causes why its smell may bee offensive: for some brains are extraordinary cold, some extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dina<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There are indeed in the rose different parts, which have different qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, but the predominant are moistning and coldness; whence to cold and moist brains, the smell is not proper, but to hot brains the rose is comfortable: therefore the Ancients in their drinking matches, used to wear rose garlands, and to lie upon beds of rose-leaves for refrigeration. <hi>Mitte sectari rosa quo loco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum sera moretur.

                     <p>THat there have been <hi>Centaurs,</hi> that is, Monsters, half Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and half Men in the world, I make no question, though Dr. <hi>Brown, (Book</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 4.) reckons this among his <hi>Vulgar Errors,</hi> who should have made a distinction between. Poetical fictions, and real truths: For <hi>Centaurs</hi> are Monsters, and aberrations from nature; not the common nature of all things, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends and effects Monsters, to shew Gods wrath against sin: but from the particular nature of those creatures of which they are ingendred. Therefore S. <hi>Ierome</hi> in the life of <hi>Paul</hi> the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remite, speaks of a <hi>Centaur</hi> seen by <hi>Paul. Pliny Nat. Hist. l.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 3. was an eye-witnesse to this truth: For he saw in <hi>Thessaly</hi> a <hi>Centaur,</hi> which was brought out of <hi>Egypt</hi> to <hi>Claudius Caesar. Ambrose Parry. (l.</hi> 15. <hi>de Monstris)</hi> speaks of a <hi>Centaur</hi> which in the year <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>254, was brought forth at <hi>Verona</hi>: there is no doubt then but Centaurs as well as other Monsters, are produced, partly by the influence of the stars, and partly by other cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, as the ill disposition of the matrix, the bad temperature of the seed, the perverse inclination of the woman, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixtion of seeds of divers kinds, sudden fear, bad diet, unwhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some air, and untimely <hi>Venus.</hi> But we must not think that these Centaurs were men, or parts of men; for they had not a reasonable soul, and therefore not capable of the resurrection. Neither must we think that these had two natures and essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al forms in one body, to wit, of a Man and a Horse: for as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very entity hath but one specifical essence, so it hath but one form which giveth that essence; so that one and the same thing cannot be under divers species in the predicament of substance. And as there cannot be two distinct forms, so neither can there be a mixtion of them in the Centaur: For the form or essence admits neither intention nor admission: <hi>Ex duobus entibus per se, non fit unum ens per se</hi>; yet I deny that there were ever a generation of people called <hi>Centaurs,</hi> as they are described by the Poets; for by this fiction they
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:57373:62"/>
understood voluptuous and lascivious men, who by <hi>Hercules,</hi> that is, men of courage, wisdom, and strength, were subdued and brought to civility, as we have shewed elsewhere (<hi>in Myst. Poetico</hi>) which fiction was occasioned by the first sight of men on Horseback in <hi>Thessaly.</hi>

And what wonder is it, that the sight of a Wolf should make a man speechlesse, when the shadow of the Hyena, will make a Dog dumb; when a Horse, if he smell but the foot-step or the guts of a Wolf, will kick and fling as if he were mad, and a Mare will cast her Colt, as they witness who write the Natures and Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of beasts; therefore the Proverb, <hi>Lupus</hi> in <hi>fabula,</hi> vvas not grounded upon a fable.

                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (3 <hi>Book c.</hi> 8.) for I believe he would find this no error, if he were suddenly surprised by a Wolf, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no means to escape or save himself; and yet I do not hold that every one who is seen by a Wolf, is dumb, becaus some are of undaunted spirits, and some have the advantage of the Wolf, and some are not apt to be infected by his breath; yet it will not follow, that it is a vulgar error; if I hold a man grows si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent at the sight of a Wolf, or that he hath an infectious breath: For it is no <hi>vulgar error,</hi> to hold the plague an infectious disease, and yet all are not infected by it.</p>

                     <p n="4">IV. That there have been Giants, that is, men of extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary strength and stature, is not to be questioned, since they are mentioned in so many Stories often in the Scripture: For what were <hi>Og, Sampson, Goliah,</hi> and the <hi>Anakims,</hi> but Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants? It is written that <hi>Pallas,</hi> the Son of <hi>Evander,</hi> whom <hi>Turnus</hi> killed, was higher by the head then the Walls of <hi>Rome</hi>: For eight hundred years after Christ, his body was found near the Walls, which being set upon its feet, the shoulders thereof touched the Pinacles of the Wall. S. <hi>Augustine (de Civit. Dei, l.</hi> 15. <hi>c.</hi> 9.) saw a mans tooth bigger then his fist. <hi>Ios. Acosta (Hist. Ind. l.</hi> 7.) shewes there were Giants in new <hi>Spain</hi>:
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:57373:63"/>
For he saw, at <hi>Mexico,</hi> a tooth as big as a mans fist. About the Straights of <hi>Magellan</hi> there are Giants ten or eleven foot high. (<hi>Acost. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 9.) The bones of Giants found in <hi>Peru,</hi> are thrice as big as the <hi>Indians. Cambden</hi> tells us of two teeth sound in <hi>Essex,</hi> which would make two hundred of ours. And if you will believe <hi>Nunesius</hi> the Jesuit, (<hi>de rebus Iapan</hi>) the King of <hi>China</hi> was guarded with Giants, which are also the Porters of his chief City. I will say nothing of the Giants mentioned by <hi>Pliny, Plutarch, Herodotus,</hi> and others. Before the Flood there were greater store of them then since, because the vigour of the Sun, the fertility of the earth, the goodnesse of food, and the feed of generation did decay. But we must not think that Giants and Pigmies are Monsters, seeing they are not the errors of nature, which aimeth at their generation, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the proportion of seed, which admits of extensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and remission: But if the quantity be such, that the functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of man are hindred, such may be called Monsters, as that young Giant at <hi>Millan,</hi> which <hi>Scaliger</hi> saw, (<hi>Exerc.</hi> 263.) which was so tall, that he could not stand, but lie along, extending his body the length of two beds joyned together.

Why the stone <hi>Selenites,</hi> as <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius</hi> shewes, touching the skin, should stay bleeding in any part of the body: or why the Ring in which it is set, being put on the third finger, stays the Dysentery within an howre: Why Rhubarb and Scamony purgeth choler; Epithemium, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lypodium and Sena, melancholy; Agarick phlegme: and why Quick-silver delights so much in gold: Why the shadow of the Fraxinus or wilde-Ash is so pernicious to Serpents. Why there is such antipathies and sympathies among Hearbs &amp; Trees. I know what I said but now (<hi>Book</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 3.) of the Garlick in hindring the Load-stones attraction, is contradicted by Doctor <hi>Brown,</hi> and before him by <hi>Baptista Porta</hi>; yet I cannot believe that so many famous Writers who have affirmed this property of the garlick, could be deceived; therefore I think that they had some other kinde of Load-stone, then that which we have now. For <hi>Pliny</hi> and others make divers sorts of them, the best whereof is the Ethiopian. Though then in some Load-stones the attraction is not hindred by garlick, it follows not that it is hindred in none; and perhaps our garlick is not so vigorous, as that of the Ancients in hotter Countries; yet I finde, that not onely by garlick is this attraction hindred, but also by fire, rust, oyl, and other fat things, also by the presence of another Load-stone; and that as it draws the Steel with one end, so it repels it with the other.

                        <hi>II.</hi> That some children have been nourished by wild beasts, many histories do assure us: <hi>Plutarch, Cicero,</hi> and others tell us of <hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Remus,</hi> who were nourished by a shee Wolf. <hi>Iustin</hi> assures us, that <hi>Cyrus</hi> suckt the duggs of a Bitch. <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanias</hi> in his <hi>Corinthiacks,</hi> writes, that <hi>AEsculapius</hi> was educated by a Hinde. <hi>AElian</hi> in his various Histories, speaks of a Bear which gave suck to <hi>Atalanta,</hi> being exposed; of a Mare that nursed <hi>Pelias</hi>; of a she-goat whose duggs <hi>AEgystus</hi> sucked; and of <hi>Telephus</hi> that sucked a Hinde. Divers others I could alledg, but these are sufficient to let us see the cruelty of some parents, and the kindnesse of some beasts far more merciful then man. Besides, the special care and providence of God towards tender and impotent infants: Yet I know <hi>Livy</hi> contradicts the story of the Wolf, that nursed <hi>Romulus,</hi> and so doth Dr. <hi>Brown,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no other inducement but that of <hi>Livies</hi> authority, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the other Historians and Monuments of <hi>Rome</hi> affirm it. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, it is no more incredible for a Wolf to nurse a child, then for a Raven every day to feed <hi>Elijah.</hi> But besides ancient sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, there be divers late Records of some children who have been nourished by Wolvs within these few years in our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Countries. In the Lantgrave of <hi>Hesse</hi> his Countrey, was found a Boy who had been lost by his parents when he was a childe, who was bred among Wolves, and ran up and down with them upon all four for his prey. This Boy was at last in Hunting taken and brought to the Landgrave, who much wondring at the sight, caused him to be bred among his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, who in time left his Wolvish conditions, learned to walk upright like a man, and to speak, who confessed, that the Wolves bred him, and taught him to hunt for prey with them. This story is rehearsed by <hi>Dresserus</hi> in his Book of new and ancient Discipline, <hi>Hist. Med. part.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 75. The like story hath <hi>Camerarius</hi> of two children, which had been bred among Wolves, and taken in the year 1544. I have read of a man bred among Wolves, and presented to <hi>Charls</hi> the ninth of <hi>France.</hi> And a strange story is extant, written by <hi>Lewis Guyon</hi>

This child having conversed with them divers years, was at last apprehended, but could neither speak nor walk upright, nor cat any thing except raw flesh, till by a new education among other children, his bestial nature was quite abolished. We see then it is not incredible for children to be nursed by Wolves; of which perhaps the old <hi>Irish</hi> were not ignorant, when they prayed for Wolves, used them kindly, as if they had been their own sons, as wee may read in <hi>Cambden (Hist.

This story is confirmed by <hi>Pliny, Gellius, Caelius,</hi> and others. There is a story of the King of <hi>Cambaia</hi>'s son, who by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant eating of poison, he had so invenomed his body, that the Flies which suckt his blood swelled and died. <hi>Solinus</hi> speaks of a people called <hi>Ophyophagi,</hi> because they fed on serpents. <hi>Avicenna</hi> speaks of one in his time, whose body was so veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, that whatsoever touched it died. I have read also in <hi>Aristotle,</hi> of a Maid who was nourished with poison. The like story is mentioned by <hi>Avicen. Alb. Magnus</hi> speaks of a Maid who delighted to eat Spiders. <hi>S. Augustine (de morib. Mon. S.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 8.) speaks of a woman who drank poison without hurt. Many other examples there may be alledged; but these may suffice to let us see, that either by Art or by Nature mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions may be fortified against the malignity of poison, as well as other animals which feed upon poison, as Vipers do upon Scorpions, Stares on Hemplock, Ducks on Toads, Quails on Hellebor, Poultry and Monkies on Spiders. Not to speak of miraculous power, by which many Martyrs have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served from poison, as was foretold in S. <hi>Mark</hi> ch. 16. <hi>If they drink any deadly poison, it shall not hurt them.</hi> Besides, mens complexions according to their ages doe vary, so that what hath been poisonable at one time, is not at another.

<pb n="115" facs="tcp:57373:66"/>
to those conceptions, who are most addicted to disordered copulation, not regarding the manner, time, or measure there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Nature indeed aiming at the eternity and propagation of the species, begins to elaborate a childe; but being hindred by the abundance, weaknesse, and other vitiosities of the seed, and menstruous blood, besides the ill disposition of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix, is forced to leave the work imperfect. Hence this lump remains inarticulate, and sometimes is cast our the ninth moneth, sometimes sooner, and in some it remains three or four years: in some it is bred without the help of man, only by the strength of imagination, and mixture of the female seed with the blood. But this is denied by <hi>Laurentius,</hi> who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so affirms the <hi>Mola</hi> to be without motion, which <hi>Zacuta</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts (<hi>Prax.

He speaks of another which being cut, was like an Onion, full of tunicles or menibrans within one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

                        </gap>sse in his Book he shews much reading and learning, yet he might have spared many of those which he calls Errors, and not fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten upon those ancient Sages from whom we have our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, more Errors then they were guilty of. For this and many more which he calls Errors, being brought to the Test, will be found Truths: But he is not guilty of this fault a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone; some have shewed the way before him. It is then most certain, that the Bears send forth their young ones deformed and unshaped to the sight, by reason of the thick membran in which they are wrapt, which also is covered over with so mucous and flegmatick matter, which the Dam contracts in the Winter time, lying in hollow caves without motion, that to the eye it looks like an unformed lump. This mucosity is licked away by the Dam, and the membran broken, and so that which before seemed to be informed, appears now in its
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:57373:67"/>
right shape. This is all that the Ancients meant, as appears by <hi>Aristotle</hi> (<hi>Animal. l.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 31.) who says, that in some manner, the young Bear is for a while rude, and without shape. Now upon this to infer, that the Ancients meant the young Bears were not at all formed or articulated, till they be licked by their Dams, is ridiculous: For who will say those wise men were so ignorant, as to think the outward action of the tongue could perform that which could not be effected by the plastick and formative power in the matrix? Doubtlesse the Ancients were no lesse curious in searching into the natures of things, then we are at this day; but if I should yeild that the cub is not perfectly articulated or formed, till it be excluded, no Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror will arise hence; for the plastick faculty which hath its original f<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>om the sperm, ceaseth not to operate after the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of the young animal, but continueth working so long as it lives: For what else is nutrition but a continual genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the lost substance, though not in whole, yet in part, and consequently it introduceth still a new form by changing the aliment into flesh. As the same Mason can build an house and repair it when decayed: so can the same plastick faculty produce the animal by generation, and repair it by nutrition. I confesse it is not called the <hi>Plastick,</hi> but <hi>Omoiastick,</hi> or assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milating faculty in nutrition, yet it is the same still, though under different names: nay, it doth not cease to produce those parts after generation out of the matrix, which it could not doe within it; as may be seen in the production of teeth in children, even in the seventh year of their age, which can be nothing else but the effect of the formative faculty. We see also how new flesh is generated in wounds; not to speak of the nails and hairs which are produced by the same faculty, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing properly parts. Besides, the faculty cannot perish so long as the soul is in the body, being an essential property which cannot be separated from the soul. Moreover, we see in some creatures, that this faculty doth not work at all in the matrix, but without: For the Chick is not formed of the Egg whilest it is within the Hen, but when it is excluded. Hence then it appears, that if the Ancients had held the young Bears to bee ejected without form, which afterward they received by the <hi>Plastick</hi> faculty, had been no Error: and though some young Bears have been found perfectly formed in the womb of the Dam, it is a question whether all be formed and shaped so.</p>

                     <p>THE Testicles were made for propagation of the <hi>Species,</hi> not for conservation of the <hi>Individuum</hi>: for Eunuchs, or such as are emasculate, have divers priviledges which others want: First, they are longer lived, because they have more radical moisture, which is not wasted by Venery: Secondly, they have taller bodies for the same reason: Thirdly, they are not troubled with so much hair, because they have not much siccity; and consequently not so much heat, which begets sic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. Fourthly, they are not subject to baldnesse, because their brain is not dried with Venery as others. Fifthly, they are not afflicted with the Gout, which is the daughter of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> who begets crude humours, weaknesse of joints, and of them the Gout: But Capons are more gouty then Cocks, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they have lesse heat, and are more voracious, saith <hi>Scati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</hi> Sixthly, they are fitter for spiritual exercises; therefore some, saith Christ, have made themselves Eunuchs for the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven; which words were mis-construed by <hi>Origen,</hi> such as emasculated themselves, against whom are both the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non and Civil Laws.

Eightly, the flesh of castrated animals is more delicate, because there is in them more benigne juice, neither is their flesh infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with the ungrateful and rankish relish of the Testicles. Ninthly, but the greatest priviledge of all is, that they are not infected with the venomous vapours of that cave neer <hi>Alepo</hi> or <hi>Hierapolis,</hi> which as <hi>Dio</hi> sheweth in the place of <hi>Trajan,</hi> poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons all creatures except Eunuchs. <hi>Scaliger</hi> gives no reason of this, nor can I, but that it is a secret in nature, or else because the Eunuchs bodies have very few bad humours, are the lesse apt to be infected with ill vapours.

                     <p>Dr. <hi>Brown,</hi> (<hi>sect.</hi> 12.) checks the Ancients for this opinion, but without cause; for all agree, that they bite off the two bags, or bladders, which hang from the groin in the same place where the Testicles of most animals are.

                     <p>But to return to our aliments, there are in them two things strange; first, that they are opposite to our natures, both pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately, in that they have not our form; and positively, in that they have a contrary form; as we see in marrow, which is the aliment of the bones, the one being soft and moist, the other hard and dry; and if it were not so, there could be no action: But this is to be understood before assimilation; for afterward the same becomes both our aliment in repairing what is lost, and a part of our bodies in assuming the form

Afterward she fell to vomiting of black stuffe mingled with hairs, thorns, and pins, and a lump like an egge, which being cut, was full of Emmets, which stunk horribly: at last, she vomited out a black hairy creature, as big as ones fist, with a long tail, and in shape like a Rat, which ran up and down the room a while, and then died. Upon this a Wizard is called, who by whispering some words in the maids ear, and by shaving of her head, on which she put a piece of white paper, having these two letters written on it, T.M. did withal lay on her head an As<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This is a fancy without ground, and yet believed by som whose faith is too prodigall.

                     <p>I could speak of that <hi>German</hi> childe, in whose head grew a golden tooth, and of many other strange effects of nature; but these may suffice to let us see all is not Witchcraft which is so called.</p>

<pb n="129" facs="tcp:57373:73"/>
of all cornuted Animals, hath the shortest Horn; but the true Unicorn, whose Horn is the highest of all others; for else <hi>Davids</hi> comparison had been childish. Now for the Horn it self, and vertues thereof, they are rejected by <hi>Ron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deletius, Parry, Brown,</hi> and some others. <hi>Rondeletius,</hi> [<hi>l.</hi> 21. <hi>de venenis, c.</hi> 61.] found no more vertue in this Horn then in an Elephants Tooth. <hi>Parry</hi> found no vertue in the French Kings Horn. <hi>Brown</hi> rejects the Horn, [because it is diversly described. 2. The Ancients adscribed no vertue to it. 3. It cannot resist Arsenick, and poisons, which kill by second qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities.] To these I answer, 1. If it be sufficient to deny an Horn, for that it is differently described, we may deny the Harts Horns, for there are great differences of them, some bigger and higher then others, some more branchy, some har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, some are cloathed with a soft Doun, others are not; and they have not all of them exactly the same colour. Neither do I allow, that all which are called Unicorns horns, are true; for some are fictitious. 2. If the Ancients adscribed no ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue to this horn, why was it of such account among them? Why did the <hi>Indian</hi> Princes drink out of them, and make Cups and Rings of them, which either they wore on their fingers, or applied to their breasts, but that they knew there was in them an antidotal vertue against poison, as <hi>Andreth Baccius [l. de V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicor.</hi>] sheweth, and the Doctor denieth not [an Antidotall efficacy, and such as the Ancients commended in this Horn] and yet two lines before, [he denies that the Ancients adscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed any vertue to it.] But sure it is apparent, that not only there is an occult quality in it against poison, as in the <hi>Elks</hi> Hoof against the falling sicknesse, but also by manifest quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties it works; for <hi>Baccius</hi> proves it to be of an excessive dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing quality, and therefore good against worms and putrefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And that <hi>Riccius</hi> the Physitian did use sometimes the weight of a scruple, sometimes of ten grains thereof in bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning fevers with good successe. 3. That it can resist Arsnick, the same <hi>Baccius</hi> proves, by the experiment which the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of <hi>Trent</hi> made upon two Pigeons, [<hi>l. de Vnic.</hi>] to which he caused some Arsenick to be given: shortly after he gave som scrapings of his Unicorns horn to one of them, which after some symptomes recovered and lived, the other died two hours af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it had eaten the Arsenick: The same Horn cured divers pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilential Fevers, and such as were poisoned. Hence then it appears, that this Horn was both commended by the Ancients, namely, by <hi>AElian, Philostrates,</hi> and divers others, as also by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:57373:74"/>
Physitians, as <hi>Ficinus, Brasavolus, Matthiolus, Mandella,</hi> and many more. It is true, that some might not find the vertue of it, either bec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>III.</hi> That some men can in their sleep perform those actions which they neither could nor durst do when awaked, is known by Histories and experience. <hi>Marianus (cap. ad audientiam)</hi> wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesseth, that he had a Maid, vvho in her sleep could rise and make bread, as if she had been awaked. <hi>Francis Mendoza, (l.</hi> 6. <hi>de Flor.</hi>) knew one vvho vvould rise in his sleep, and in the night time vvalked out vvith his naked sword, vvith vvhich hee struck some of the City guard; but at last being vvounded, vvas awaked. <hi>Tirannel (in Mendoza</hi>) speaks of an <hi>English</hi> man in <hi>Paris,</hi> vvho rose in his sleep, vvent down towards the river <hi>Sene</hi>; vvhere, having met vvith a Boy, he killed him, and so returned (being all this vvhile asleep) to his bed. <hi>Horstius (de noctambulis</hi>) vvrites of one vvho in his sleep usually vvould arise, go up and down the stairs, lock and unlock his chests. He speaks of another, vvho dreamed he vvas to ride a Journy, riseth, puts on his cloaths, boots and spurs, gets up into the Window, vvhere he sate stradling, beating the vvals vvith his spurs, till hee vvas awaked. And he sheweth, that at <hi>Helm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stad</hi> one rose in his sleep, vvent down the stairs into a Court; from thence toward the Kitchin, neer vvhich vvas a deep Wel: into this he went down, holding fast to the stones by his hands
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:57373:76"/>
and feet; but when hee touched the vvater, with the cold thereof he vvas awaked; and finding in what danger he was, gave a pitiful out-cry, which awaked those in the house, who having found him, got him out, and brought him to his bed, where he lay many days speechlesse and immoveable, being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly weakned with fear, cold, and crying. Another story he hath no lesse strange then this, of a young Gentleman vvho in his sleep arose naked, carrying his shirt in his hand, and by the help of a rope clambers up to a high Turret in the Castle where he then was: Here he findes a nest of Mag-pies, which he robs, and puts the young ones in his shirt; and so by the same rope comes down again, and returns to his bed: The next morning being awaked, tells his brother how he dreamed that he had robb'd a Pies nest; and withal wondring what was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of his shirt, riseth and findes it at his beds feet, with the young birds wrapt up in it. To these examples, wee may add that of <hi>Lot,</hi> who in his sleep begot his two daughters with childe: This Dr. <hi>Brown (Book</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 6) will not admit, though he hath a direct Text of Scripture against him: For there it is said, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. <hi>That Lot neither knew when his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters lay down, nor when they rose up.</hi> Which words are expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by <hi>Irenaeus</hi> (<hi>c.</hi> 51. <hi>cont. Haeres.) That</hi> Lot <hi>had neither pleasure, nor consent, nor sense, nor knowledge of this act: Chrysostome</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms the same, expounding these words, <hi>Lot</hi> (saith he, <hi>Hom.</hi> 44. <hi>in Genes.) was so intoxicated with wine, that he knew not at all what he did, lest he should be guilty of so great a crime; acting in this neither wittingly nor willingly.</hi> S. <hi>Austin</hi> is of the same minde, (<hi>Cont. manic. l.</hi> 22.) and other Expositors. Now if one ask, how sleeping men can do such things? I answer, it is partly by the strength of Imagination, which is more active in sleep then when we are awake. 2. All sleepers are not apt for such actions; but such whose natures are melancholy or cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerick, whose spirits are more fervent, subtil, and agile then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, moving the bmuscles, and by them the body, though the outward senses be ound up by sleep. 3. They catch not that hurt in their sleep, which they would do if awaked; because their senses are not avocated by other objects, they have no apprehension of fear, their imagination is more intent in sleep; and withal their Genius or good Angel is carefull of them.</p>

                           </gap>letius (l.</hi> 1. <hi>de Piscib. c.</hi> 12.) shews, that his wife kept a fish three years in a glasse, without any other food but water; and yet the fish grew so big, that the glasse could not at last contain it. And I have kept Spiders my self in a glasse, which I dismissed after they had fasted nine months. The Camelion also liveth upon the air, <hi>Oscitans vescitur, follicans ruminat, de vento cibus,</hi> saith <hi>Tertullian</hi> (<hi>in Pallio.</hi>) I have seen a Camelion which was brought hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from <hi>Africa</hi> by sea, and kept in a box, which all the while was never seen to feed on any thing else but air. Yet D. <hi>Brown (Book</hi> 3, <hi>c.</hi> 21.) will not have air to be his food for these rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons: 1. <hi>Because</hi> Aristotle <hi>and</hi> AElian <hi>speak nothing of this. Ans.</hi> Neither do they speak any thing against it, which likely they would have done, if they had thought their feeding on aire had been fabulous. They do not speak of what food each ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal is sustained: and though they doe not speak of this airy food, yet <hi>Pliny,</hi> and others do. 2.

Answ.</hi> So I have seen Dogs and Cats eat Flies; Monkies and Turkies eat Spiders, and Dogs eat grasse; yet it will not follow, that they feed on these, but rather eat them out of wantonnesse, or for physick; so doth the Camelion sometimes eat flies; and so doth the Ostridge eat Iron, and divers birds swallow stones. 3. <hi>There are found in this animal the gu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Answ.</hi> These parts are not superfluous, though they feed on air, but necessary; because the air on which they feed, is not pure, but mixed, and therefore nutritive. Again, they vvere to eat sometimes flies, for pleasure or physick, therefore the stomach was necessary. Moreover, we must not think every thing in nature superfluous, whereof vvee can give no reason; for so wee may accuse her for giving eyes to Wonts, tears to Men, Goats, and Dogs, whereof they make no use. And why she is so bountiful to the Fox, and so niggardly to the Ape, in giving the one too great a tail, the other none at
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:57373:77"/>
all. 4. He reasons <hi>From the bignesse of the Camelions tongue, and the slimy matter in it, that air cannot be its nutriment. Answ.</hi> Its tongue vvas made to catch flies, but not for nutriment, as is said: and that slimy matter is given as well for its prey, as for the destruction of Serpents its enemies: for it useth upon the sight of a Serpent, to let fall that slimy matter on his head, vvith which he is presently killed. 5. <hi>The air cannot nourish, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it hath no taste. Ans.</hi> Tast belongs not to nourishment; for they who have lost their tast, are not therefore the lesse nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed. Again, though the pure air be tastlesse, yet air thickned and moistned, is not so as we may perceive by the divers tasts in waters. Besides, though the air be tastlesse to us, it may be otherwise to the Camelion. 6. <hi>There can be no transmutation of air into the body nourished, because there is no familiarity of matter between air and a living body. Ans.</hi> This may be true of pure air, but not of mixed, and of our bodies, not of the Camelions. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, divers creatures live on dew, which is but watrish air; and how many in <hi>Arabia</hi> are fed with Manna, vvhich is both begot of and in the air. 7. <hi>Nutriment is condensated by the natural heat, but air by the bodies heat is rarified. Ans.</hi> The contrary of this is seen continually by the air vve breath out, which is still thicker then that we take in: For though the heat doth rarifie the air, yet by the moisture of our bodies it is thickned. 8. <hi>All aliment must remain some time in the body; but air is presently expelled. Answ.</hi> The air which is attracted by the Lungs, and serves for refrige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the heart, is quickly again expelled, because it is to stay no longer then it performs its office, vvhich is to refrige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate; but that air on which the Camelion and other creatures feed, must and doth stay longer. 9. <hi>Air in regard of our natural heat, is cold, and so contrary; but aliment is potentially the same. Ans.</hi> All aliment is contrary at first, or else there could bee no action, and so no nutrition. Again, vvhat is cold, is potentially the same vvith our bodies, in respect of the substance, not of the quality. Besides, how many sorts of cold meats, fish, fruits, hearbs, sallets, do men eat in Summer, vvhich notwithstanding are the same potentially with their bodies. 10. <hi>Some deny air to be an aliment, or that it entreth into mixt bodies, and its not easie to demonstrate, that it is convertible into water; and we doubt that air is the pabulous supply of fire, much lesse that flame is properly air kindled. Ans.</hi> Some have denyed Snow to be white, or fire hot, therefore no wonder if some fantastical heads deny air to be an element, or that it entreth into mixt bodies. <hi>Danaeus</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed thinks air and water to be all one, because water is quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:57373:77"/>
turned into air, and because they have great affinity: but this is against himself; for what can be turned into another sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance is not the same, nothing is convertible into it self: and if air be vvater, because this can be turned into that, then vva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is earth; for in many caves vvater drops turn to stones, and so we shall make but one element. Again, if air enter not into mixt bodies, what is that unctuous humidity or oyl which we finde in all perfect mixt bodies? It cannot be fire nor earth; for these are neither unctuous nor humid: nor can it be water; for though that be humid, it is not unctuous, it must needs then be air. Again, when the Doctor saith, <hi>It is not easie to demonstrate the conversion of air into water</hi>; he denieth both sense and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: for this conversion is as demonstrable as our respiration in winter, when the air which a man attracteth, is turned into water drops on his beard, sheets, rugs, and blankets: reason also shews this; for if water can be turned into air, why cannot air be turned into water, both communicating in the symboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal quality of humidity. Lastly, his doubting, and the Lord <hi>Verulams</hi> denying air to be the pabulous supply of fire, is causless: For I ask, what is it that substantially maintains the fire? They answer, <hi>It is combustible matter in the kindled body.</hi> But in this they trisle: for I ask what this combustible matter is? Earth it cannot be; for earth, 1. as earth, is not combustible; and we see that after the fire is spent, earth remains in ashes. Nor can it be water; for that maintains not the fire, but extinguisheth it. It must then necessarily be air: for we see by daily expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that the more of this unctuous or aereal humidity is in the fewel, the more apt it is to burn. And when this is spent, the fire dieth, as we see in candles, lamps, torches, links, and whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever hath pinguedinous matter in it. <hi>Fernelius</hi> indeed gives a threefold food to the fire; to wit, combustible stuffe, smoak, and air; but all this may be reduced to air: For nothing is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bustible, which hath not in it aereal humidity: and smoak is nothing else but air cloathed with the fiery quality of siccity and calidity, wanting nothing but light to make it fire. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we see how quickly smoak is turned into flame, and this into smoak again. To conclude, air is the very life of fire, which would quickly die, if it received not animation by ventilation. This we see in cupping-glasses, how nimbly the fire, when al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most extinguished, will upon a little vent suck the air to it.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>THAT divers animals, even men and women. can subsist without food, is plain by these examples: A certain maid in the Diocesse of <hi>Spire, anno</hi> 1542. lived three years with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out meat or drink. In the year 1582. in the Palatinat there lived a maid nine years together without food, who afterward married, and had children. <hi>Rondeletius (l.</hi> 1. <hi>de pis. c.</hi> 13.) writes of a maid in <hi>France,</hi> and of another in <hi>Germany,</hi> who lived divers years without food: and of another whom hee saw that had no other food but air ten years together. <hi>Fici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> saw a man who had no other food but what the air and Sun afforded him. In the year 1595. a maid lived at <hi>Colen</hi> three years without food; another at <hi>Bern</hi> lived eighteen years on the air alone, <hi>anno</hi> 1604. Other examples I could alledge out of <hi>Citesius</hi> Physitian of <hi>Padua, Lentulus</hi> of <hi>Bern, Ioubertus,</hi> and others; but these may suffice to let us see, that nutrition doth not consist meerly in meat and drink. I will not here al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge examples of miraculous fasts, or of Diabolical and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical; but such as are meerly natural, as these which I have named: for in them the natural heat was weak, and not able to master the humidity with which they abounded: So then, where there is a weak heat, and much sweet phlegm, which is imperfect blood, as Physitians call it, there the life may bee prolonged without food.</p>
                     <p>I have read (<hi>Mendoza in Flor. phil.</hi>) of a <hi>Venetian</hi> who fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted forty six years, being of a cold constitution, and abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with thick phlegme; we see this in the hearb <hi>Semper-vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vum,</hi> which many years together liveth, and is green with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out earth or water, having much natural humidity within it. So the Camelion is onely fed by air, as is said, which appears to be true (however Dr. <hi>Brown (Book</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 21.) writes to the contrary) by these reasons, 1. The testimonies both of anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and modern Writers, except a few<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the witnesses of
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:57373:78"/>
some yet living, who have kept Camelions a long time, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver saw them feed but on air. 2. To what end hath Nature given it such large Lungs beyond its proportion? Sure not for refrigeration; lesse Lungs would serve for this use, seeing their heat is weak; it must be then for nutrition. 3. There is so little blood in it, that we may easily see it doth not feed on solid meat.</p>
                     <p>The Doctor saith, <hi>That Frogs and divers Fishes have little blood, and yet their nutriment is solid.</hi> But he doth not prove the nutriment to be solid. Besides, they have more blood then is in the Camelion. 4. To what end should it contnually gape more then other animals, but that it stands more in need of air then they, towit, for nutrition as well as refrigeration. The Doctor imputeth this gaping to the largenesse of his Lungs: This is but a shift; for other animals whose Lungs doe exceed both the Lungs and whole bodies of many Camelions, do not gape as this doth, and yet they stand more in need of refrigeration, as having more blood and heat, then ten thousand Camelions. 5. He that kept the Camelion which I saw, never perceived it to void excrements backwards; an argument it had no solid food: and what wonder is it for the Camelion to live on air, when <hi>Hay</hi> a beast of <hi>Brasil,</hi> as big as a Dog, was never seen to feed on any thing else, as <hi>Lerius</hi> witnesseth? The Doctor concludes, <hi>That the Camelion is abstenious a long time, but not still, because divers other animals are so.</hi> He may as well infer, that the Camelion is cornuted, because divers other animals are so. Each species hath its property, which is not communicable to other species<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> otherwise it were no property.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <hi>II.</hi> That water is the aliment of divers creatures, is plain; 1. By the vegetables; for hearbs, trees, and plants are nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished by it. 2. By animals; for it is the food of many fish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, as was shewed by that fish which <hi>Rondeletius</hi> his wife kept three years in a glasse. Grashoppers feed upon dew, which is water.</p>
                     <p>I have read (<hi>Mendoza, Prob.</hi> 23.) of Worms in <hi>Armenia,</hi> which feed only on Snow; and of some birds whose aliment is only water. 3. By men; for <hi>Albertus Magnus</hi> speaks of one who lived seven weeks together only upon water. I know <hi>Aristotle, (l.</hi> 7. <hi>de anim.) Galen,</hi> and <hi>Averroes</hi> are against this opinion. But we must understand they speak of the pure element of water, which is not nutritive; not of that which is impure, mixed, or compounded<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for such may nourish.</p>
                     <p>Doctor <hi>Brown</hi> will not have water an aliment, 1. <hi>Because
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:57373:79"/>
some creatures drink not at all. Answ.</hi> To such, water indeed can be no aliment, and so indeed his argument is good; but to say, that water is no creatures aliment, because some crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures do not drink at all, is as much as if he should infer, that no man eats bread, because some men never ate any. 2. He saith, <hi>That water serves for refrigeration and dilution; therefore it is no aliment. Answ.</hi> Why may not the same thing serve both? Doe we not many times eat cooling hearbs, which both refri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerate and feed us. 3. <hi>If the ancients</hi> (saith he) <hi>had thought water nutritive, they would not have commended the Limpid water for the best, but rather turbid streams, where there may be some nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment. Answ.</hi> If the Ancients had spoken of Waters fittest to feed Eels, Frogs, and such as live on mud, they would have commended the turbid streams; but they spake of such Waters as are fittest for our bodies, and therefore they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended the Limpid for the best; and yet he confesseth in the purest water there is much terreous residence, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly some nutriment.</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <hi>III.</hi> Chilification is an action of the stomach, but not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely necessary, because many creatures in the Winter live without it: And this act is not to be ascribed to the heat of the stomach; for though heat as heat doth concoct; yet it doth not chilifie; for neither fiery, nor feverish, nor any other heat of the body can perform this, but that of the stomach; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this action must proceed from the specifical form and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per quality of the stomach, which turns all it receives into a white creamy substance, but cannot produce several substances, as the Liver doth; because it is not so hot as the Liver, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it hath not that specifical form which the Liver hath. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, that the stomachs work is to master the aliment, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coct it, and to prepare it for the Liver. But besides this qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the stomach, there is another more strange, when som can eat and digest coals, sand, lime, pitch, ashes, and such like trash. This is called by Physitians a disease, under the name of <hi>Pica, Citta, Malacia</hi>; but I think it proceeds not only from a distemper in the stomach, and malignant acide humors impacted in the membrans thereof, but also, and that chiefly, from some occult quality. <hi>Forestus (lib.</hi> 18. <hi>Obs.</hi> 7.) knew one who swallowed down live Eeels, another who ate a piece of Lime as big as his fist, and all without hurt. <hi>Fonseca (Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult. part.</hi> 1. <hi>cons.</hi> 94.) knew a woman who daily did eat earthen ware or pot-sheards so long as she lived; and she lived till she was old; even when she fell sick of a fever, she could not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:57373:79"/>
from eating of this stuffe: therefore I do not much won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that the Ostridge can eat and digest iron, which it doth not by its heat, as <hi>Cardan</hi> thinks; (though I deny not but the great heat of that bird, and the thicknesse of his Gizzard may be some help) but rather by an occult quality, or the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of its whole essence, as <hi>Fernelius</hi> writes: For the truth of this, we have not only the testimonies of the Ancients, but the experiments also of late Writers: For <hi>Langius</hi> in his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles, writes that he saw some of those Ostriches in the Duke of <hi>Ferrara</hi>'s Garden, who swallowed and digested pieces of gold, and other metal. <hi>Leo Africanus</hi> saith, that they swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low whatsoever they finde, even iron. And what wonder is it if the Ostrich eat Iron, when Rats do the same. But Doctor <hi>Brown</hi> denies this for these reasons, (<hi>book</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 22.) Because <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Oppian</hi> are silent in this singularity. 2. <hi>Pliny</hi> speaketh of its wonderful digestion. 3. <hi>AElian</hi> mentions not Iron. 4. <hi>Leo Africanus</hi> speaks diminutively. 5. <hi>Ferne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> extenuates it, and <hi>Riolanus</hi> denies it. 6. <hi>Albertus Magnus</hi> refutes it. 7. <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> saw an Ostrich swallow Iron, which excluded it again undigested. <hi>Answ. Aristotles, Oppians,</hi> and <hi>AElians</hi> silence, are of no force; for arguments taken from a negative authority, were never held of any va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity. Many things are omitted by them, which yet are true; It is sufficient that we have eye-witnesses to confirm this truth. As for <hi>Pliny,</hi> he saith plainly, that it concocteth whatsoever it eateth. Now the Doctor acknowledgeth it eats Iron: <hi>Ergo,</hi> according to <hi>Pliny,</hi> it concocts Iron, <hi>Africanus</hi> tells us, that it devours Iron. And <hi>Fernelius</hi> is so far from extenuating the matter, that he plainly affirms it, and shews, that this conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is performed by the nature of its whole essence. As for <hi>Riolanus,</hi> his denial without ground, we regard not. <hi>Alber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Magnus</hi> speaks not of iron, but of stones which it swallows, and excludes again without nutriment. As for <hi>Aldrovandus,</hi> I deny not but he might see one Ostrich which excluded his iron undigested; but one Swallow makes no Summer. All in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals have not the same temperament: Among men, some will digest that which others cannot: there might be some weaknesse or distemper in the stomach of that Ostrich. Again, digestion or concoction (if we speak of the first which is the work of the stomach) is nothing else but the altering of the aliment, not into a new substance, (for that is done by the Liver) but into a new quality, in which the natural heat sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates the excrements from that which is fit for nutrition: If so,

then the Iron which this Ostrich excluded, was digested; for the stomach suckt something out of it, and altered that which was fit for nutriment, sending away the superfluous part: Thus the Iron was not undigested, because egested: For of every thing we eat, there is some part excluded. Now the Doctor cannot deny, but that the Iron receiveth an alteration in the stomach; and what I pray is this but chilification? Yet hee will not have this alteration to proceed from the power of natural heat; but from an acide and vitriolous humidity (if there were such a manifest quality, or a vitriolous humidity to corrode the Iron, it would doubtlesse corrode the stomach it self; therefore the safest way is to acknowledge an occult quality.</p>
                     <p>Again, if the Doctor will speak Philosophically, the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal agent in digestion is heat, not moisture; for humidity compared to calidity, is a passive quality; so then the vitrioll corrodes by its heat, not by its moisture.</p>

Whereas then he saith out of <hi>Aristotle, That Flies, Bees, &amp;c. make a sound by the allision of an inward spirit, upon a little membrane of the body.</hi> I will not deny but this may be in some, but not in all: for I have observed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary in Gnats, whose sound is made by their wings only; when I pluckt off one wing, they sounded with the other; but when they lost both, they made no sound at all. Again, when he saith, <hi>That the sight of the Glow-worm depends upon a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving spirit,</hi> he expresseth but a remote cause: for the proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mat and immediat cause is the natural heat in a clear luminous water or humour: For I have observed in those I kept some days in grasse, that as this heat decreased, the humour thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and as it were congealed, &amp; so the light grew dimmer; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing quite dead, there remained the congealed humour, white like a piece of chalk. Those I took were for three or four

nights, so shining, that holding the book neer, I could see to read by them. Again he saith, <hi>That grains whose ends are cut off, will suddenly sprout; which thwarts their opinion, who say, that the Pismires bite off the end of the corn, which they store up to prevent the growth thereof.</hi> Both these Assertions may bee true: For corn cut at the ends, may grow, and yet that may faile which the Pismire bites; because of some malignant qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity contrary to the grain, impressed upon it by the Pismires bite, which is not in the knife. Again, he saith, (<hi>Book</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 27.) <hi>That the plant animal, or vegitable Lamb of</hi> Tartaria, <hi>is not much to be wondred at, if it be no more then the shape of a lamb in the flower or seed.</hi> Sure it must be more then this, if those that write the story thereof deceive us not. For <hi>Scaliger (Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erc.</hi> 182.29.) describes it out of them to be like a Lamb in all the parts of it: in stead of horns, it hath long hairs like horns, it is covered with a thin skin, it bleeds when it is wounded, and lives so long as it hath grass to feed on; when that is spent, it dieth. And they write also, that it is a prey to Wolves. All these circumstances may be true: For 1. the shape, why may not this plan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Why may it not have a Downy, or Woolly skin, as well as Peaches<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Quinces, Chesnuts, and other fruits which are covered with a Down, called <hi>Lanugo</hi> by the Poet? 3. Why may it not bleed as well as that Tree we mentioned but now, called <hi>Draco,</hi> from the shape of the Dragon which its fruit hath; the juice of this Tree from the resemblance is called the blood of the Dragon, well known in Physick for its astringent and corroborating quality. 4. Why may it not have some animal motions, as well as that plant called <hi>Pudica,</hi> which contracts it leaves when you touch or come neer it, and dilates them again when you depart? Or that Tree in the Isle of <hi>Cimbub on,</hi> whose leaves falling on the ground, crawl up and down like Worms: they have (saith <hi>Scaliger, Exerc.</hi> 112.) two little feet on each side: if they be touched, they run away.

And surely this is no more improbable then for a Lion to be afraid at the fight of a fire, or for an Elephant to be afraid at the sight of a Hog; which the <hi>Romans</hi> knew, when they drove an Herd of Swine among the Enemies Elephants, by which means they got the Victory of <hi>Pyrrhus.</hi> So much afraid is the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant of an Hog, that if he hear him gruntle, he will run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.

Who can give a reason, why the scratching upon brasse, or other hard metals, should distemper the teeth; and
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:57373:81"/>

Now for that Lion which killed the Cock and his Hens, I deny not but it may be true<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet hence we cannot conclude that the Lion is not afraid of the Cock: For a speciall antipathy may by accident faile in some individuals.

                        <hi>II.</hi> That Spiders will kill Toads, is recorded in Story; yet the Doctor (3. <hi>Book c.</hi> 26:). in his Glasse <hi>found that the Toad swallowed down the Spiders which he included.</hi> This may be true, and the other untrue: For all Spiders are not venemous; and those that are, have their degrees of venome, and so wee may say of Toads. That Spiders have a more active poyson then the Toad, is confessed by those who write of these insects: For I read both in Ancient and Modern Writers, that Spiders have poysoned Toads with their touch; but never that any Toad poysoned a Spider: for the Doctors Toad did not poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son but swallow the Spiders, being impatient of hunger, which it cannot endure so long as the Spider; some whereof I have kept nine moneths without food in a glasse, and then they were as nimble at the end of this time, as when I put them first in. Now that some of our Spiders are venemous, I have observed; for by chance one of my acquaintance bruised a Spider which had lighted on his face when he was in his bed, and presently the place blistred and grew scabbed. I have likewise found, that the small bodied Spiders with long legs (which as I think some call Spinners) are more venemous then the big ones: for I inclosed in a glasse some great black bodied Spiders with short legs, with some of those small b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

venome of some spiders that they will crack a <hi>Venice</hi> glass, as I have seen; and <hi>Scaliger</hi> doth witness the same, however the Doctor denies it.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. <hi>That the Basilisk should proceed from a cock's egg, is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit as monstrous as the brood it self,</hi> saith the Doctor; and yet presently after he grauts, <hi>there may ensue some imperfect or mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous production.</hi> That cocks growing old and decrepid, lay eggs, or something like eggs, on which they sit, as hens do on theirs, is not to be denied: for many will witness this; among the rest, <hi>Lev. Lemnius</hi> tels us (<hi>de mirac. l.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 12.) of two old cocks, which in the City of <hi>Ciricaea,</hi> could be scarce driven away from incubation on their eggs, till they were bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten off by slaves<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> And because the Townesmen had conceived a perswasion that of this egg the Basilisk might proceed, they caused the cocks to be strangled, and the eggs to be bruised. It is granted then that cocks lay eggs, or some seminall matter which they exclude and sit upon. 2. That of these eggs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue strange productions. 3. This may be without a commix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the seed of both sexes, (though the Doctor denieth it) for we see what strange shapes of Insects are produced of putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction even in mans body without any seed. 4. it is granted also that there have been and are Basilisks, though the descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions of them do in some circumstances differ: For there may be divers sorts of them; those which <hi>Lemnius</hi> describes, seen sometimes in <hi>Germany,</hi> have acuminated heads, and somewhat yellow, three palmes long, having a belly with white spots, a blew back, a crooked tail, and a wide gaping mouth. This description differs but little from that of <hi>Albertus Magnus (de anim.</hi> 25.) <hi>Scaliger</hi> speaks of one that was seen in <hi>Rome</hi>; and <hi>Lemnius</hi> tels us that <hi>Germany</hi> is not free from them; but that they are not so venemous as those of <hi>Africa.</hi> Now whether this Serpent is begot of the cocks'egg, is the question; we have tradition and witnesses for it, besides probability: for why may not this serpent be ingendred of a cocks putrified se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal materials, being animated by his heat and incubation, as well as other kinds of Serpents are bred of putrified matter.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. The Doctors reasons against the two-headed <hi>Amphisbae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> are not satisfactory. 1. (saith he) <hi>The principal parts, the Liver, Heart, and especially the brain, regularly they are but one in any kinde whatsoever. Answ.</hi> This is not so: For God to shew his wisdome and greatness, hath made variety of shapes among the creatures; some fishes and Insects have no heads at all, some but one, the <hi>Amphisbaena</hi> two, as <hi>Nicander, Galen, AElian,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:57373:82"/>
Pliny,</hi> and others witness. I have read of birds in <hi>Paphlagonia</hi> with two hearts, of the Serpent <hi>Chersydros</hi> that hath two tongues; of a worm in <hi>Taprobona</hi> vvith four heads. I say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the <hi>Hydra,</hi> because doubtfull: vvhy then may not the <hi>Amphisbaena</hi> have tvvo heads? 2. He saith, <hi>That it was ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived to place one head at both extreams; for it will follow that there is no posterior or lower part in this animal. Answ.</hi> This vvill not follovv: for though the head be at both extreams, yet they do not both at the same time perform the office of the head; but vvhen the one moveth, the other suffers it self to be moved, and is in stead of the tall; so that head vvhich moveth East<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvard, dravveth the other after it; the former then is anterior, the other posterior; and this when it moves Westward, draws the other: and so what before was posterior, becomes now an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior. This was so ordained by nature for the more conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency of this creature, which cannot turn it self about so nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly as other serpents do. And of this minde is <hi>AElian (de anim.)</hi> 3. He saith, <hi>That if this animal have two heads, it is not to be called one, but two, because</hi> Aristotle <hi>saith, that animal is not one but two, which hath two hearts: and therefore geminous births are christned with two names, as having distinct souls. Answ.</hi> There may be some reason why two hearts should give demonstration to two animals: because the heart is the originall of life, and all vital actions, which need but one fountain and original: but the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is not alike in the <hi>Amphisbaena's</hi> two heads: for though it harh but one life, and consequently but one heart, yet it hath two several motions backward and forward: and therefore needed two principles or prime movers by reason it cannot turn so readily it self about as other animals, which though they have but one head, yet have divers instruments of motion sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servient to that head, which are defective in the <hi>Amphisbaena</hi>: and yet the head is not the originall of all motions in our own bodies: for the hearts motion of <hi>Systole</hi> and <hi>Diastole</hi> depends not upon it. Besides, the Doctor denies not but <hi>there are bicipitous serpents,</hi> and yet are not called two from their two heads: Why then should the <hi>Amphisbaena</hi> be denied this priviledge? But he saith, <hi>these other are monstrous productions, and besides the intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Nature.</hi> He saith, but he proves it not: I acknowledge no monsters in Insects, especially in such as are begot of the Suns heat and putrifaction: nor is there any shape in them besides the intention of Nature. For if by nature he means the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it is not besides its intention to receive any form: if he understand the Suns influence, or formative power, or
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:57373:83"/>
God himselfe, it is not against their intention to produce all kind of shapes for the ornament of the world. But if these bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitous productions were against their intentions, yet this will not serve his turn, because such a production is but one, although it hath two heads. Lastly, geminous births receive two names in Baptisme, not because they have two heads, but because they have two distinct souls, and individuall properties flowing thence; so that they are indeed two individuals, though their body be but one from the Navell downward, as that Monster was of which <hi>Buchanan</hi> speaks. Now the <hi>Amphis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baena</hi> having but one sensitive soule, cannot be called two not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding its two heads. 4. <hi>Many animals</hi> (saith he) <hi>with one head perform contrary motions. Answ.</hi> It will not follow that therefore the <hi>Amphisbaena</hi> hath but one head, or that these one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed animals can as easily perform contrary motions with one head, as that which hath two. Neither are these contrary motions performed immediatly by one head, but by inferior or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans which are not in this animall. Besides, I observe that in many worms there is as much life and activity in the faile as in the head; and therefore may be said to have two heads effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively, if not formally. For in Damask-Rose leaves which I kept by me, not being throughly dried, worms were procrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, whose heads when I cut off, their bodies were moved by their tails, as if those had been other heads.</p>

And this also we may observe in men and women oftentimes: Nature is wiser in her productions then we are in our conceits and imaginations. 2. <hi>It overthrowes</hi> (saith he) <hi>Gods benediction, Be fruitfull and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply.

Many Bitches and other females have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with pain at the time of their littering.

The like improvidence and cruelty we find in Ostridges, who exclude their Eggs in the sand, and so leave them without further care, to his providence, in whom all things live, and move, and have their being: Therefore God complains in <hi>Iob,</hi> (<hi>Chap.</hi> 39.14, 15, 16.) of the Ostridges astorgie and cruelty, in leaving her Eggs in the earth, forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that the foot may crush them, or that the wild beast may break them: shee is hardned (saith he) against her young ones, as though they were none of hers.

And no lesse cruelty is there in this young nursling, then in the viper: for he both destroyeth his Foster-brothers, and the mother that brought forth and fed him. I read also in <hi>AElian</hi> of Scorpions begot sometimes in Crocodiles Egges, which sting to death the

There is great odds between the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of <hi>Africk</hi> or other hot Countries, and those in cold Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mats; and so there is in poysonable herbs and Serpents, which lose their venome upon transplantation: in cold Countries the most fierce, cruell, and poysonable animals lose these hurtfull qualities. 2.

                     <p>COncerning Moles, the Doctor proves they are not blind, <hi>(Book 3. cap. 8.)</hi> because they have eyes: for we must not assigne the Organ and deny the Office. <hi>Answ. Scaliger</hi> tells us they have not eyes, but the form of eyes. <hi>Pliny (lib. 11. cap. 37.)</hi> saith, They have the effigies of eyes under the membrane, but no sight, being condemned to perpetuall darknesse. <hi>Aristotle (lib. 3. de Animal.)</hi> saith, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, it seems they have eyes under a thin skin, and a place for eyes. The Prince of Poets calls them, <hi>Oculis captos,</hi> (<hi>Geor.</hi> 1.) <hi>Scali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> (<hi>Exer.</hi> 243.) saith, They are deprived of the noblest sense, and gives the reason, because living still under ground, they had no use of sight. If then by eyes are meant the perfect or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans of sight, with all things requisite thereto, I deny they have eyes, and consequently sight: they have neither the organ nor the office, except we say, that like is the same. Now these forms of eyes Nature gave to the Moles rather for ornament the use; so wings are given to the Ostrich, which never flies; and so a long tail to the Rat, which serves for no other use but to be catched sometimes by it. And to what end hath Nature given tears to men, and other males? Again, Nature in all her works aims at perfection; but is oftentimes hindred by some obstacle, which is the reason why the Mole wants eyes, and the <hi>Manucodiata</hi> feet: but what is defective in the Moles eye, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compensed by the quickness of his hearing. 2 He saith, That <hi>they are not exactly blind; for they can discern the light, which is one object of vision. Ans.</hi> I do not believe they can discern the light at all. 2. If they could discern the light, yet they are blind: for I have known men stark blind, who yet have discerned light from darknesse when a candle came into the room. 3. Light is not the object of vision; for we see not light, but lucid and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured; we see not light, but by it: Light is <hi>Objectum quo, non quod.</hi> 3. He saith, <hi>A Mole cannot be properly blind, if it want the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans or capacity of seeing: for privations presuppose habits.
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:57373:85"/>
Answ.</hi> A Moal is as properly blind as he in the ninth of <hi>Iohn,</hi> who was born so; for he had no capacity of seeing naturally, no more then the Moal; yet he is said to be blind from his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, and that properly, because he was a subject capable of sight, <hi>quatenus</hi> an animall or sensitive creature, which is capable of sight, because of senses, whereof the sight is one. Moals there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are capable of sight, in the genius of <hi>animals,</hi> though not in the <hi>species</hi> as a Moal, and so an Oyster is capable of sight.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Doctor prying too narrowly into the sayings of the Ancients, reckoneth them amongst his <hi>Vulgar Errors,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rightly understood, are no errors at all; as when they say the Elephant hath no joynts, they mean<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> their joynts were stiffe, and not so easily flexible as those of other animals. When they write that the Swan sings, they meant that with their wings they made a kind of harmonious noyse, as the learned Poet expresseth in that Verse:
<q>
                           <l>Cantantes sublime fernnt ad sidera Cygni;</l>
                        </q>
Which he explains in another place,
<q>
                           <l>Vt reduces ludunt illi stridentibus alis.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>When they say the Lampery hath nine eyes, they mean so many spots resembling eyes. When they write, that a Horse and Dove have no gall, they mean, that these have not baggs of gall annexed to the Liver, as other animals. When they speak of Griffins, that they were animals like Eagles in their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts, and behind like Lions; they spake mystically, shewing by this hieroglyphick, the valour, magnanimity, courage, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacity that ought to be in Princes and Governours. And when they write, that Toads doe pisse, they did not speak properly, but onely meant, that they squirted out some liquid matter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind. When they spoke of the Toads stone, they do not mean a true and proper stone, but a concretion or induration of their crany. When they write that Hares are double Sexes, they write no more then what hath been observed in other animals which are Hermophroditicall, and in whom sometimes females have been changed into males. Hares also make a shew of a double Sex, because of the two Tumors representing Testicles, and their holes or cavities near the siege in the males, by which they seem also to be females. And what they write of their su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfaetation, is true: for the like is incident to some other ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, even to women. When they say that Snails have eyes at
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:57373:85"/>
the ends of their horns, their meaning is, that these are like eyes. So when they hold, that all animals of the land, are in their kind in the sea, they mean that there was a great resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance between the sea and land-animals. So when they write, that the Peacock is ashamed when he looks on his black feet, they write symbolically, intimating that pride ends in shame, when men look upon their deformities and infirmities. When they say, whelps are blind nine dayes, they mean that they are so for the most part, though some be blind three or foure dayes longer. When they write that Worms have no blood, they write properly; for how can those have blood which have no liver, or other sanguifying organs? that red humour in them is not blood properly, but analogically.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <hi>II.</hi> That there is in man a right and a left side, is manifest by Scripture, generall consent, Experince and Reason, which also prove the dignity, agility, and strength of the right side above the left; because on the right side is the Liver, the cistern of blood, in which consisteth our life, vigor &amp; strength, therefore this side is not so often as the left subject to palsies, because it is stronger to resist and repell the matter of that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease into the weaker side. Yet Doctor <hi>Brown</hi> (<hi>Book</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 5.) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies any <hi>prepotency in the right side, and such as ariseth from the constant root of Nature, because he finds not Horses, Bulls, and Mules, are generally stronger on this side. Ans.</hi> There is great diversity between the conformity, situation, and parts of mans body and beasts, and therefore to reason from the one to the other, is absurd: We find not that variety of colours in the eyes of Horses, Bulls, and Mules, that are in Mans eyes; nor doe we find the Horses gall annexed to his liver; shall we hence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre a deficiency of things in man? The weight of the Bodies of Four-footed Beasts, lieth equally upon all foure, and all foure equally are used in motion; and therefore there was no reason why any side or legge should be more preporent then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; but it is otherwise in man, to whom Nature hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven one side stronger and nimbler then another for uniformity of action. Hence the right hand and foot are stronger then the left. Neither is it Custome but Nature that hath given this dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity to the right side: For I have known some who have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured by custome to bring their left hand to perform the offices of the right, but could never doe it with that ease and dexterity. <hi>Scaliger</hi> and <hi>Cardan</hi> speak of one who had never a hand, yet with his right foot could perform all the offices of the right hand, write, sew, eat, drink, &amp; fling darts. 2. He saith,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:57373:86"/>
                        <hi>that children indifferently use either hand. Answ.</hi> That is because as yet in the tender infant the heat and strength of the body is equally diffused, and not setled in one part more then in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but as he begins to gather strength, and the body to be more solid, so doth the right hand begin to be more agill; though I deny not but in some the left hand is more agill, but these are few, and aberrations from the common course of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: for we see that in all her works there are some acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall deviations. His other objections are coincident with these two, and his discourse of the right and left side of heaven, is impertinent to this purpose: therefore I will spend no time in refelling it: for some make the East, some the South the right part of heaven; but I will conclude with <hi>Aristotle, (hist. ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 15) the right side and left in man consist of the same parts; but the left side is every where weaker.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. The end why mans body was made erected, was to look up toward heaven, whence the soul hath its originall, where our hopes should be, and our happiness shall be; by the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of which, we are brought to the knowledge of Gods goodness and wisdom: For the heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament his handy work, <hi>Psal.</hi> 19. Yet the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor (<hi>book</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 1.) <hi>will not have this the end of mans erection, but out of</hi> Galen <hi>the exercise of Arts, which could not be performed in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other figure. Again</hi> (saith he) <hi>the eyes of divers fishes regard the heavens<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> birds who have no upper eye-lid, have in this the advantage of man: So the position of the frog with his eyes above the water, serves to behold a great part of the heavens. Answ.</hi> All these are weak Assertions; for the God of Nature created man to enjoy happiness, and to glorifie him; this is the chief end of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Now this happiness is heaven, by beholding which, our knowledge of God is confirmed, our hopes established, and our joy and affections to heavenly things are enlarged: The invention of Arts then was but a secondary end, which it seems <hi>Galen,</hi> that meer naturall man, thought to be the chief end. And whereas the Doctor saith, (that by <hi>sursum aspicere,</hi> was not meant to look upward with the eye, but to have his thoughts sublime;) I would know what means so forcible to sublimate the thoughts as the eye? All knowledge and affection of and to the object, comes by the senses. How should <hi>Abraham</hi> have known the glory and multitude of his posterity, had he not looked up (as God commanded him) to the stars? The wise men found Christ in <hi>Bethlehem</hi> by looking upward to heaven, where they saw his star. Christ in blessing the bread, and in
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:57373:86"/>
Praying, looked up towards heaven: should not our eyes be fixed there where our treasure is? Our Saviour went up to heaven, and we exspect him again to return with the clouds of heaven. Our eyes then should be directed thither as well as our thoughts. The Philosophers by the knowledge of the first <hi>Mobile,</hi> came to the knowledge of the first mover. And though birds, some fishes and frogs, may have an advantage in looking upward, yet this advantage was not given them to look on heaven, of which they have neither knowledge, hope, affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or interest: they look upward then not to contemplate heaven, but to watch either flies to feed on, or kites, hawkes, and other ravenous fowle to avoid them.</p>
                     <p n="5">V. He doubts <hi>whether mice can be procreated of putrifaction.</hi> So he may doubt whether in cheese and timber worms are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated; Or if Betels and wasps in cowes dung; Or if butterflies, locusts, grashoppers, shel-fish, snails, eeles, and such like, be procreated of putrified matter, which is apt to receive the form of that creature to which it is by the formative power dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. To question this, is to question Reason, Sense, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience: If he doubts of this, let him go to <hi>AEgypt,</hi> and there he will finde the fields swarming with mice begot of the mud of <hi>Nylus,</hi> to the great calamity of the Inhabitants. What will he say to those rats and mice, or little beasts resembling mice, found generated in the belly of a woman dissected after her death, of which <hi>Lemnius</hi> is a witness, who thinks this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration might proceed of some sordid excrement or seminal pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of those animals with which the womans meat or drink had been infected. I have seen one whose belly by drinking of puddle water, was swelled to a vast capacity, being full of small toads, frogs, evets, and such vermin usually bred in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trified water. A toad hath been found in a sound piece of Timber.</p>
                     <p n="6">VI. <hi>That men swim naturally he cannot assent to, because other a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals swim as they go; but man alters his natural posture as he swims,</hi> (4. <hi>Book c.</hi> 6.) <hi>Answ.</hi> This is no reason; for man alters his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral posture when he crawls; will it follow therefore, that this motion is no natural to man. But to speak properly, swim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming is no natural motion, neither in man nor beast: For if we take natural as it is opposite to animal, swimming is an ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal motion; and if we take natural as it is opposite to artificial, then swimming is an artifical motion; for there is some Art in it. But if we take nature for a propensity, facility, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, or disposition; then, I say, these are as well in
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:57373:87"/>
men as in beasts. Therefore <hi>Pliny</hi> tells us of the <hi>Troglodites,</hi> that they swim like Fishes. <hi>Lerius, Acosta,</hi> and other <hi>Indian</hi> Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans write, that the <hi>American</hi> children begin to swim as soon as they begin to walk; and that for eight dayes together they can live in the Sea, and longer if it were not for feare of the great Fishes: so swift and skillfull they are in swimming, that they out-swim the Fishes and catch them; and so farre they exceed other animals in this motion, that they can swim with the left hand onely, holding hooks and darts in the right, which no other creature can doe. If it be objected, That swimming is not naturall to man, because he learns it; I answer, That walking and talking are naturall actions to man, and yet he learns both when he is a child. So I have seen old birds teach their young ones to flye. Lastly, if it be naturall for beasts to swim because of their posture, then it must needs be as natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall to those wilde men, who from their infancy were brought up among wild beasts, to walk upon all foure, having no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther posture.</p>

                     <p>THe Doctor [<hi>Book</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 1.] quarrels with some pictures, as 1. With that of the Pelican <hi>opening her breast with her Bill, and feeding her young ones with her blood.</hi> But for this he hath no great reason: for <hi>Franzius (de animalib.</hi>) to whom he is behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for much of his matter, tels him that this and divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pictures are rather Hieroglyphical and Emblematical, then truly Historicall: for the Pelican was used as an Emblem of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall affection among the Gentiles; and of Christs love to his Church among the Christians. 2. With that of the Dolphin, <hi>because he is painted crooked, whereas his naturall figure is straight.</hi> This is true, yet he is crooked sometimes, as when he leaps and jumps, and in this posture the painters expresse him. 3. With the Serpent tempting <hi>Eve, because it is painted with a virgins head, which might afford suspition to Eve in beholding a third humanity beside herselfe and Adam.</hi> But this could not so much trouble <hi>Eve,</hi> to speak with one like her selfe, as to hear a
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:57373:87"/>
reasonable discourse proceed from a Serpents mouth; for she could not be so grosly ignorant in that happy state, where there could be no deception of mind, as to think a serpent could speak and discourse rationally; therefore Sathan cunningly as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumes a womans face, whereby there might be the lesse suspiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. neither could <hi>Eve</hi> be amazed to see a Serpent with a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans face: for divers other creatures have the form of humane faces, such as Baboons, Apes, Monkies, Satyrs, and that <hi>Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> beast mentioned by <hi>Andrew Thevet,</hi> called <hi>Haijt</hi> by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, and <hi>Guedon</hi> by the <hi>French</hi>; the picture whereof may be seen in <hi>Gesner.</hi> 4. He quarrels with the pictures of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> with Navels, <hi>accounting those parts in them uselesse super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities; because the use of the Navell is to continue the infant unto the mother, and by the vessels thereof to convey its aliment.</hi> The Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell, which is the center of the body, was not uselesse or super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous in <hi>Adam</hi> or <hi>Eve</hi>; because they were ornaments, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which the belly had been deformed: Therefore <hi>Solomon</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst other beautifull ornaments of the Church, puts in the Navel for one, <hi>Thy Navel,</hi> saith he, <hi>is like a round Goblet, Cant.</hi> 7.2. He might as well quarrell with the picture for giving haire to <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi>; for the sole use of haire both for head and chin, is for ornament and distinction. 5. He questions Christs pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture with long hair, seeing <hi>he was no Nazarite by vow.</hi> I answer, 'Tis true, he was no Nazarite by vow; for he drank Wine, and approached the dead, yet he was a true Nazarite, because he was as the Apostle saith, <hi>separated from sinners</hi>: Therefore it was fit he should in this respect weare long haire, as <hi>Sampson</hi> the Nazarite and Type of Christ had done before. Besides, haire being an ornament, and signe of ingenuity (for slaves durst not weare long haire;) and being also the custome of those tines and Countries, it is most probable he wore long haire; and therefore his picture is causlesly quarreld with; especially seeing he was so painted in that picture sent by <hi>Lentulus,</hi> President of <hi>Iudea,</hi> to <hi>Tiberius.</hi> And in the same length of hair he was found in some old brasse coins at <hi>Rome,</hi> which <hi>Theleus Ambrosius</hi> did see; in his Introduction to the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Tongue, he speakes of this. 6. He rejects <hi>Abrahams</hi> picture sacrificing <hi>Isaac, because he is described as a little boy.</hi> Answ. <hi>Iosephus</hi> makes <hi>Isaac</hi> at that time 25 years of age; some Rabbins make him above thirty. But <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> the Rabbin makes him onely twelve years old: And sure at this age he might be able, by his Fathers help, to carry a bundle of wood up the hill, being men were stronger at that time then now; howbeit he was but a Boy in comparison

of his fathers age, who was now 125 years old, if <hi>Isaac</hi> was 25. for he was born in the hundredth yeare of his Fathers life. 7. He reproves the picture of <hi>Moses, because painted with horns.</hi> It was not the Painter but the Scripture which gave him horns. For the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word <hi>Keren</hi> is so translated by <hi>Aquila</hi>

                        </gap>, and by <hi>Ierom, Cornuta</hi>: So it is in the vulgar Editions of <hi>Sixtus</hi> and <hi>Clemens.</hi> So it is translated by divers Protestants, by <hi>Munster,</hi> by <hi>Rivet,</hi> and some others, and therefore <hi>Munster</hi> doubts whether that relation of <hi>Steuchus</hi> be true, that the Jewes are offended when they see <hi>Moses</hi> painted with horns, seeing <hi>R. Solomon</hi> and <hi>Kimchi</hi> doe use the word <hi>Horn,</hi> saying, That the beams of <hi>Moses</hi> face did resemble horns; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>R.

It is true, there is a difference between <hi>Keren</hi> and <hi>Karon,</hi> that signifying a horn, this to shine, but who could put this distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction truly, before the invention of the Hebrew pricks; neither is it materiall which way it be translated, seeing clear horns do cast rayes of light, and luminous bodies cast abroad their rayes like horns, as we see in the Sun and Moon. Neither is there any danger of conformity with <hi>Iupiter Ammon,</hi> (as the Doctor thinks) if <hi>Moses</hi> be painted with horns: for <hi>Iupiter</hi> was painted and worshipped not with Rams horns alone, but with the Rams head and skin, with which his Image was year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adorned; because in the shape of a Ram he shewed a Well of water to <hi>Bacchus,</hi> when he was dry in the Desarts of <hi>Libya</hi>; and because he turned himselfe into a Ram when he sled from the Giant into AEgypt. And lastly, he shewed himselfe to <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules</hi> in the shape of a Ram.

And that there were so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, <hi>Boisardus</hi> makes it appeare by what he hath collected out of ancient Authors, concerning the difference, originals, times, and numbers of the Sibyls, where he shewes, that <hi>Sibylla Cumaea</hi> whom <hi>AEneas</hi> consulted, and <hi>Cumana,</hi> who sold the Bookes to <hi>Tarquin,</hi> were different, between whom were six hundred years distance. As for their youthfull faces, he hath more reason to quarrell with the Poets then with the Painters; but indeed neither are to be blamed; For the Sibyls may be aged, and yet look young, as many aged people doe; some I have already

Their names were <hi>Zanthus, Podargus, Aithon</hi> and <hi>Lampus</hi>: Is it likely that he would keep such horses and never ride them? whereas Horsmanship was in use long before.

And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Ancients used to fight in Chariots, yet sometimes they fought on Horseback too, being as <hi>Pliny</hi> saith, taught so to fight by the Theban Centaurs. As for <hi>Caesars</hi> Saddle and Stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rops, they are neither dishonour to his picture, nor repugnant to story; for though we find some of the ancient equestral Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues without Saddle or Stirrops, it will not thence follow these were not in use; for we find the ancient <hi>Roman</hi> Statues bare-headed; will it therefore follow there were no use of Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets, or that they fought or rid bare-headed?

Answ.</hi> She had no reason to bewaile her death, to which she freely offered herself; but to die childlesse deserved lamentation, because that was a curse among the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites. 2. <hi>Because the women went yearly to talk with Iephtha's daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which had she been sacrificed they could not have done.

                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, by the Seventy; and <hi>Leallaah</hi> by the Chaldee Paraphrast; so it is interpreted by <hi>Munster,</hi> by the old Latin E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, by the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>English</hi> translation. But suppose the word were derived from <hi>Tanah,</hi> to declare or speak, yet this will not prove <hi>Iephtha's</hi> daughter was alive: For in mournfull com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints and lamentations over the dead, words and Elegies were oftentimes expressed, and Prosopopeia's are used to them as if they were alive; as we see <hi>Davids</hi> Lamentation for <hi>Iona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,</hi> and in other places both of sacred and profane writ. So did that sorrowful mother speak to her dead son <hi>Eurialus,</hi> and <hi>AEnaeas</hi> to dead <hi>Pallas</hi> in the Poet. 3. Because it is said in the Text, <hi>And she knew no man,</hi> he inferres, that vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginity was her onely death. <hi>Answer.</hi> These words, <hi>she knew no man,</hi> are added to shew the cause why the women so much lamented her death, in that she died childlesse. 4. <hi>The offering</hi> (saith he) <hi>of mankind, was against the Law of God. Answ.</hi> True: But will it therefore follow, that <hi>Iephtha</hi> did not sacrifice
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:57373:90"/>
his daughter. He may as well infer, that <hi>David</hi> committed not adultery and murther, because these were against the Law of God. How often are Gods Laws violated by the best of his servants? 5. He thinks <hi>the Priests and people would have hindred this sacrifice; and that</hi> Jephtha <hi>was no Priest; and that he had eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion for his vow by redeeming his daughter; and that his vow of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice was to be understood only of that which was sacrificeable and lawfull. Answ.</hi> These are but the conjectures of those who would defend <hi>Iephtha</hi>: for it is more likely neither Priest nor people durst oppose his resolution, being now strong and crowned with victory; and though he was no priest, yet it was no unusual thing for Princes and great Commanders some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to perform the Priests office; and though he might have evaded his vow, yet it seems he knew not so much, for super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition had blinded him: therefore he saith, <hi>I have opened my mouth to the Lord, and I cannot go back.</hi> And doubtless he thought that the sacrificing of his daughter was lawfull; grounding this his conceit upon Gods command to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him for his readiness to sacrifice his son. Lastly, he saith, the 31 verse may be thus rendred, <hi>It shall be the Lords; or I will offer. Answ.</hi> Most Translations have it, <hi>and I will offer</hi>; although the Hebrew <hi>Ve,</hi> sometimes signifies <hi>Or</hi>; but this is sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Hence then we see, the Painter is not to be blamed, who in representing <hi>Iephtha's</hi> sacrifice, is waranted by the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, by <hi>Austin, Ambrose,</hi> and <hi>Hierom,</hi> by the ancient Rabbins, and <hi>Iosephus,</hi> besides reas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ns. For what needed <hi>Iephtha</hi> so to vex himself, and tear his cloathes, if he meant only to sequester his daughter from marriage and humane society? Again, there was neither Law nor President for him to vow his daughters virginity; nor could such a vow be effectuall without her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent. It was a curse also in <hi>Israel</hi> to be childless, and it had been ridiculous in him or her, to vow virginity and then to lament it.</p>

                        </gap>overty and humility. For as great men wear rich skins, and costly furs, he was contented with a Camels skin. By this garment also he shewes himself to be another <hi>Elijah,</hi> (2. <hi>Kings</hi> 1.) who did wear such a garment, and to be one of those of
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:57373:90"/>
whom the Apostle speaks, who went about in skins, of whom the world was not worthy. Neither was it unusefull in <hi>Iohns</hi> time, and before, to wear skins; for the prophets among the <hi>Iews,</hi> the Philosophers among the Indians, and generally the Scythians did wear skins; hence by <hi>Claudian</hi> they are called <hi>Pellita juventus.</hi> Great Commanders also used to wear them; as <hi>Hercules</hi> the Lyons skin, <hi>Acestes</hi> the Bears, <hi>Camilla</hi> the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. <hi>Iohns</hi> garment then of Camels hair, was not as some fondly conceit, a Sack-cloth, or Chamblet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So in <hi>Exodus (chap.</hi> 25.) the peoples are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded among other skins, to bring to the Tabernacle Goats hair: not as if they were to pluck off the hair for <hi>Aaron,</hi> and keep the skins to themselves, but to offer both: therefore in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall <hi>Hairs</hi> is not expressed, but the word <hi>Goats.</hi>

For the Doctors questioning divers superstitious obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, (5. <hi>book,</hi> c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 22.) as the crossing of a Hare, the falling of salt, the breaking of Eggshels, and such like: I have nothing to say, but to conclude with him, that they are superstitious, yet ancient. But when he asks, <hi>whether the present Hebrew be the unconfounded language of Babel.</hi> I answer, That if by the present <hi>Hebrew</hi> he mean the language which they now speak, it is not: for as the greatest part of the world lost that tongue (except <hi>Hebers</hi> family) at the confusion of Babel, so <hi>Hebers</hi> family) the Jewes) lost it themselves in the captivity of Babel; for being mingled with the Chaldeans, they made a mixt language of <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Chaldee,</hi> which for distinction sake was called <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riac</hi>; and sometimes <hi>Hebrew,</hi> because the Jewes, <hi>Hebers</hi> poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, spake it. Hence <hi>S. Hierom</hi> is to be understood when he writes, that <hi>Matthew</hi> penned the Gospel in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and <hi>Euse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> when he calls it his native language, they mean the <hi>Siriac,</hi> which was now the native language of the <hi>Hebrewes</hi>; and S. <hi>Paul</hi> in the <hi>Acts</hi> is said to have made a speech to the people in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> the meaning is, he spake in <hi>Syriac</hi>; for they understood not the ancient <hi>Hebrew,</hi> onely the Priests and Lawyers kept the knowledge of it. Therefore it had been vain for <hi>Matthew</hi> to write his Gospel, or for <hi>Paul</hi> to speak in pure <hi>Hebrew</hi> to those that understood it not; yet there is an <hi>Hebrew</hi> Gospel of S. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> extant, which some think was written by S. <hi>Bartholomew</hi> and by <hi>Pantaenus,</hi> coetaneal with <hi>Origen</hi> brought from the <hi>Indies,</hi> this imperfect and torn Copie, <hi>Munster</hi> saith he extorted fromthe Jewes.

                     <p>THe Doctor in his subsequent discourses (6 <hi>Book c.</hi> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) hath many learned Cosmographicall passages col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected dextrously out of many approved Authours, against which I have nothing to say; onely he must give me leave to dissentfrom him in his opinion concerning the Suns heat,when he sayes, that <hi>if the Sunne had been placed in the lowest spheare where the Moon is, by this vicinity to the earth its heat had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable.</hi> What will he say then to that world lately discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the Moon by glasses as fallacious as the opinion is erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous.

No celes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall body is capable of heat, because not passive; except we will deny that quintessence, and put no difference between Celestial and Elementary bodies. The Sun then is not the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject but the efficient cause of heat; the prime subject of heat is the element of fire, the prime efficient cause is the Sun, which can produce heat, though he be not hot himself. And this is no more strange then for him to produce, life, sense, vegetation, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:57373:92"/>
odors, and other qualities in sublunary bodies, which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding are not in him, though from him. Again, if the Sun be the subject of heat, because he is the original and effector of it; then <hi>Saturn</hi> is the subject of cold, the Moon of moisture, and <hi>Mars</hi> of drinesse, and so we shall place action and passion, and all elementary qualities in the heavens, making a Chaos and confusion of celestial and sublunary bodies. Moreover, if the Suns vicinity causeth the greatest heat, why are the tops of the highest mountains perpetually cold and snowy? Why doe there blow such cold windes under the Line, as <hi>Acosta</hi> shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth? We conclude then, that the Sun is the cause of heat, though he be not hot; as he is the cause of generation and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, though he be neither generable nor corruptible. <hi>Ovid</hi> then played the Poet not the Philosopher, when he causeth the Suns vicinity to melt <hi>Icarus</hi> his waxen wings.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. He sayes, That <hi>Islands before the Flood are with probability denied by very learned authors. Answ.</hi> He doth not alledge any one probable reason out of these Authors in maintenance of this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion. I can give more then probable reasons that there were Islands before the Flood, First, the whole earth it selfe was made an Island; therefore the Sea is rightly called <hi>Amphitrite,</hi> from encompassing the earth; For this cause <hi>David</hi> saith, That <hi>God hath founded the Earth upon the Waters.</hi> And though Earth and Sea make but one Globe, yet the Earth onely is the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the world, as <hi>Clavius</hi> demonstrates. 2. The world was in its perfect beauty before the Flood; but Islands in the Sea tend no lesse to the beauty and perfection of the world, then Lakes upon the Land. 3. All the causes of Islands were as well before the Flood as since; for there were great Rivers running into the Sea, carrying with them mud, gravell, and weeds, which in time become Islands. There were also Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes, by which divers Islands have been made, the vapour or spirit under the bottome of the Sea thrusting up the ground above the superficies of the water; and who will say, that in the space of 16. hundred years before the Flood there should be no Earth-quakes? Again, in that time the Sea had the same power over the neighbouring lands which it hath since the Flood. But we find that Islands were made by the Sea wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away the soft and lower ground in peninsules at this day; there doubtless the Sea wanted not the same force and quality before the Flood: for there were as forcible winds, and as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous waves. Lastly, Islands are made when the Sea for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sakes some Land which it useth to over-flow; and this proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:57373:92"/>
also we cannot deny to have been in the Sea before the Flood; for there were windes to beat off the Sea, &amp; to drive to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether heaps of sand into some altitude, whereby the water is forced to forsake the land, whence hath proceeded divers Isles.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. He saith (<hi>Book</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 4.) <hi>there were more then seven Ostia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Nilus.

These seven mouthes have their particular names given them by <hi>Mela</hi> and other Geographers, and so the Scripture gives it seven streams, <hi>Isaiah</hi> 11.15. at this day there are but foure left, two of which are of little use; therefore the Doctor needed not to have troubled himselfe so much as he doth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause so frequenely this is called the seven-mouthed river; for it is usuall to give denominations not from the exact number, but from the most eminent and major part of the number, He may as wel except against <hi>Moses,</hi> who indivers places reckons but seventy souls which went down into AEgypt; and yet Saint <hi>Steven</hi> in the Acts mentions 75 souls. Again, he dislikes the Title given by <hi>Ortelius</hi> to <hi>Nilus</hi> when he calls it <hi>the greatest river of the world.</hi> But <hi>Ortelius</hi> was not mistaken in calling it so; for it is the greatest, though not perhaps in length, because it may be some are longer, the which are not certainly known; yet in breadth when it overflowes the whole Countrey, in which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect it may be called rather a Sea then a River; and so it was called by the Ancients, as <hi>Pior Valerius</hi> sheweth. <hi>Nile,</hi> saith <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sil,</hi> is liker a Sea then a River, and some esteem the length of it a thousand German miles, or 35. degrees, having Summer at the springs thereof, and Winter at the other end the same time. It is also the greatest in regard of use and benefit; for no River doth so much enrich a Countrey as <hi>Nilus</hi> doth <hi>Egipt.</hi> It is the greatest also in same; for no River is so renowned in Writers. By the world also is meant so much as is known to us; for the Rivers of <hi>America</hi> are known rather by hearsay then otherwise. The greatness of this River was of old Hieroglyphically expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the vast body of a Giant. There is a Statue of <hi>Nilus</hi> in the <hi>Vatican,</hi> the picture whereof is in <hi>Sands</hi> his Travels, the

greatest of Poets, by way of excellency calls this the <hi>Great Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, In magno maerentem corpore Nilum.</hi> Again the Doctor will have <hi>Rome</hi> (magnified by the Latines for the greatest of the earth) to be lesser then <hi>Cairo</hi>; and <hi>Quinsay</hi> to exceed both. But he is much mistaken; for <hi>Cairo,</hi> as <hi>Sands</hi> tells us who was there, is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 5. <hi>Italian</hi> miles in length with the suburbs, and in bredth scarce one and a halfe; whereas <hi>Rome</hi> was almost fifty miles in compasse within the walls, and the circuit of the suburbs much more, as <hi>Lipsius (de mag. Rom. l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 2.) hath collected out of divers Authors: He shewes the greatnesse of it also by the number of the people therein<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for there were three and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thousand poor which was maintained upon the publick charge; then if we reckon the multitude of rich men, and their train, which was not small: (for divers of the great persons; maintained families of foure hundred persons;) if we look upon the multitude of Artificers, of Souldiers, of Courtiers, of stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers from all parts flocking thither, as to the great Metropolis and shop of the World, we shall find there were no lesse then four millions, or fourty hundred thousand people, which is more then can be found in many large provinces. <hi>Heliogabolus</hi> collected the greatness of this City by the Cobwebs found in it, which being gathered together, did weigh ten thousand pound. Another argument of its greatness may be collected out of <hi>Eusebius</hi> his Chronicle, who reckons that for many dayes together there were buried of the plague ten thousand daily.

What Citie ever had that multitude of stately Palaces, Temples, Theaters, Olisks, triumphant Arches, Baths, and other publick buildings, as <hi>Laurus</hi> sheweth? As for <hi>Quinsay</hi> in <hi>China,</hi> we have a fabulous narration in M. <hi>Paulus Venetus,</hi> that is was an hundred miles in compasse; but his narrations have been found erroneous, and if the Kingdome of <hi>China</hi> comes far short of the greatnesse of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, surely <hi>Quinsay</hi> must fall short of <hi>Rome,</hi> which as the Poet saith,

As for <hi>Quinsay</hi> now it is not thirty miles in compasse, as <hi>Nicolas de Contu</hi> sheweth who was there. Again he saith, That <hi>this anu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all overflowing is not proper unto Nile, being common to many currents in Africa.</hi> I answer, It is so proper to <hi>Nile,</hi> that no other River doth so orderly, so frequently, so fully, overflow their banks as this doth. <hi>Crocodiles</hi> (saith he) <hi>are not proper to Nile. Answ.</hi> They are so proper, that no river either in Africk, Asia, or America, hath such Crocodiles as <hi>Nilus,</hi> if either we consider the magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, multitude, or fiercenesse of them; Other Crocodiles, chiefly the American, are gentle, the AEgyptian fierce and cruel, which is the cause that Dogges are so afraid to drink out of <hi>Nilus,</hi> whence arose that proverb, <hi>Canis ad Nilum,</hi> The greatest Indian Crocodiles exceed not twenty foot in length, as <hi>Scaliger</hi> shewes; but those of <hi>Nile</hi> are three hundred foot long, whose jawes are so wide, that one of them can contain a whole heifer at a time: some have been found there of 25, and above 26. cubits in bigness, as <hi>AElian</hi> reports. The Romans to shew how proper this beast was to <hi>Nile,</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented AEgypt by a Crocodile in that Coin on which <hi>Augustus</hi> stampt a Crocodile tied to a palm-tree, with this Inscription, <hi>Primus relegavit</hi>; for he subdued AEgypt, and restored peace to them. Again he saith, That the <hi>Causes of Niles inundation are va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable, unstable, and irregular, because some yeares there hath been no increase at all. Answ.</hi> He may as well say, that the causes of all natural effects are variable, because sometimes they faile: But all naturall causes operate for an end; therefore are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, regular, and stable, so are not Chance and Fortune, which <hi>Aristotle</hi> excludes from naturall causes: Are the causes of rain, and storms irregular, variable, and unstable; because sometimes it rains more in Summer then in Winter? Or is generation ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular, because sometimes women miscarry? Naturall causes alwayes produce their effects, or for the most part so, that they faile but seldome, and that upon the interposition of some im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment, whereas fortuitall causes produce their effects sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: The causes then of <hi>Niles</hi> overflowing, are not contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, but certain, constant, regular, and stable; because they never faile, or but seldom upon some impediment in the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of that effect. As for the AEgyptian raines I have spoken elsewhere, (<hi>animad. on Sir Walt.

But <hi>Scaliger</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies that there is any snow at all; yet I doe not think the high mountains there should be lesse subject to snow then in <hi>Peru</hi> under the line, although the people in the low Countries thereof be black, and the windes in the vallies warm.

Besides, both Philosophers and experience tell us, that the sulphurous vapours which in thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring and lightning break through the clouds, do make black the things touched with them; so saith <hi>Aristotle, Pliny,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: And though Brimstone make red Roses and Tiffany white, it wil not therfore follow that it will make any thing white; the Sun beams which whiteneth the Linnen, tawns the skin; and if the whitning of things by sulphur, proceeds as he saith from its drying and penetrating quality, much more would all things be whitened by the Sun and fire, whose heat is more penetrating and drying; but we see how many things by them are blackned; and the very heat of the fire will induce black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse upon paper, though there come no smoke at all to it. He therefore who long since destroyed <hi>Sodom</hi> with fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, will with the same materials punish the wicked in hell, where shall be in stead of light, blackness and darkness.</p>

                        <hi>IV. Philoxenus the Musician desired a Crains neck, not for any pleasure at meat, but fancying thereby an advantage in singing, (Book</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 14.) <hi>Answ.</hi> That this <hi>Philoxenus</hi> was a glutton, ancient Historians do affirme, and that he wished a Cranes neck to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the longer pleasure of meat and drink, is asserted by <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, Athenaeus, Machon</hi> the Comick, <hi>AElian</hi> and others: <hi>Machon</hi> sayes, that he wished a neck of three cubits long. He was a great Fish eater, therefore was nick-named <hi>Phylichthys,</hi> and <hi>Solenista</hi> from <hi>Solenes,</hi> a kind of Oysters which he delighted in. Being one day at Table with <hi>Dionysius</hi> the tyrant, he had a small mullet set before him, which he takes up in his hand, and holds to his eare; <hi>Dionysius</hi> asks what he meant by that? He answers, that he had asked advice of <hi>Galataea,</hi> but she sayd that she was too young to advise him; and that he were best to consult with the old <hi>Galataea</hi> in <hi>Dionysius</hi> his dish: At which the Tyrant laughing, gave him the great Mullet that he had before him, which was very pleasing to the glutton. This story is recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by <hi>Caelius Rhodiginus,</hi> and doubtless that proverb, <hi>Collaria cadavera,</hi> that is long necked carcasses, which <hi>Erasmus</hi> borrowes from <hi>Aristophanes,</hi> hath relation to this wish of <hi>Philoxenus</hi>; for by it are meant Gluttons and Drunkards, who being buried in sleep and wine, are little better then dead carcasses with long necks, as this <hi>Philoxenus</hi> was, whose belly was his God; of whom it is recorded, that when he saw a dish of good meat, he would spit upon it, that he might enjoy it all alone: Yet
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:57373:95"/>
the Doctor denies this wish upon no other ground, but <hi>because it was absurd.</hi> Sure this is no ground at all; for it is no unusall thing with Gluttons and Drunkards, both to wish and doe absurdly. His wish was not so ausurd as that of <hi>Midas,</hi> vvho vvished all he touched might become gold; or that of <hi>Helioga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balus,</hi> vvho vvished and longed that he might eat the <hi>Phoenix,</hi> being the onely single bird in the World. Again, this vvish of <hi>Philoxenus</hi> was not so absurd as the Doctor thinks: for though the Tongue be the organ of tast, yet the Oesophagus cannot be altogether tastlesse, seeing there is one common membrane which is nervous to it and the Tongue. Now the membrane of the Tongue is the medium of tast: vvill any man say then, There is no tast or pleasure in deglutition? We find by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, how unpleasant to the throat is the discent of bitter pills, or potions; so that I could never yet swallow a bitter pill, be it never so small. That there is much pleasure in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glutition of sweet meats and drinks, is plain by the practice of those vvho to supply the vvant of long necks, use to suck their drink out of long small Canes, or Quils, or glasses with long narrow snouts: And others for vvant of these vvill tipple lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surely, and let their liquor glide down the throat gently and by degrees: therefore doubtlesse <hi>Philoxenus</hi> knew that a long neck conduced much to the pleasure of eating and drinking, which made him vvish for a Cranes neck, that he might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy for some longer time the relish of his delicate viands, which gave the name afterwards to dainties and sweet meats; for they vvere termed <hi>Placontae Philo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And indeed there is no reason that he who lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved fish and sweet meats so well, should with himselfe a Horse, vvho must content himselfe vvith Oats and Hay, and somtimes vvith dry straw, without any sawce; he should rather have vvished himself to have been <hi>Apuleius</hi> his Asse, who sometimes filled his belly with good pies, and other dainties. Lastly, when he saith, That <hi>canorous birds have short necks, and that long necked birds are not musicall.</hi> I answer, It is not the length of the neck that hinders medulation, but the widenesse thereof: For which cause youth before puberty, women, &amp; Eunuchs, have more melodious voyces then men, whose <hi>a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

A greater wonder then this may be seen in those that write of <hi>AEtna, Vesuvius,</hi> the burning hills of <hi>Island</hi> and <hi>America,</hi> whence are belched out and elevated into the air, great stones by those fiery vapours which issue out of those <hi>Vulcans.</hi> Within these twenty years <hi>Vesuvius</hi> cast out great stones above twenty miles distance. And therefore it is no such wonder for a burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Candle to swim, which being extinguished, sinketh; for the flame adds levity to it. But let us see the Doctors reasons, 1. <hi>Iosephus</hi> (saith he) <hi>affirms that onely living bodies float, not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptorily averring they cannot sink, but that they doe not easily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend.
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:57373:96"/>
Answ.</hi> The words of <hi>Iosephus</hi> are these (<hi>de bel. Iud. l.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 5.) <hi>The most heavy bodies that are being cast into this Lake, float upon it, neither can any man be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>and esteemeth thereof as a Fable. Answ. Aristotle</hi> speaks not lightly but se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously of this Lake; for from the quality of supporting heavy bodies, he deduceth one of his prime Arguments to prove the salsedinous quality of the Sea. But the Doctor deceiveth himselfe in the word <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap> is to be moderat in eating, drinking, &amp; speaking. <hi>Andrew Thevet</hi> (saith he) <hi>saw an Asse cast therein and drowned. Answ.</hi> So saith <hi>Camerarius</hi> indeed, and I will not question the truth of <hi>Thevets</hi> narration; there may be diuers reasons of this, the violent hurling of the Asse with his burden under the vvater. 2. His sudden suffocation by the sulphurous exhalations. 3. The Lake in all places thereof, and at all times, hath not the same violent ebullitions, but sometimes there is remission. The Asse then might sink in such a place, and at such a time when and where the boiling was remiss, the vapours weak, and the water thinner then in other parts of the same Lake. But hence it will not follow, that in other parts, and at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her times, the heaviest bodies may not swim there.</p>

<pb n="176" facs="tcp:57373:97"/>
laugh: For he saw here the vanity both of most men taking pleasure in those things which are accompanied vvith much pain and sorrow: Besides, he saw here the folly of the <hi>Roman</hi> rich men, who held Thistles such a dainty dish, that they would not suffer poor men to eat thereof, engrossing them vvith great summes of money to themselves, vvhich notwithstanding the Asses did eat on free cost. Was it not then a ridiculous thing to see rich men pay so dear for Asses food, and to debarre poore men from that meat which they permitted to Asses? <hi>Pliny</hi> could not but laugh at the consideration of this folly. 2. When he saith, that <hi>Laughter is not meerly voluntary,</hi> he can inferre no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from hence, except this, That it was as naturall for <hi>Crassus</hi> to laugh, as for others; which I deny: For some are more naturally inclined to it then others; all have not the like temper and constitution of body, some have hard and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid hearts, heavie and pensive spirits, which no ridiculous ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject can move to laugh; these are called <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>. There be others again who can never be moved to weep. But he gives us here a lame definition of laughter, when he sayes, <hi>It is a sweet contraction of the Muscles of the face, and a pleasant agitation of the vocall organs.</hi> These are but the effects of laughter, the cause is the softnesse and agility of the heart, the cheerfulnesse and levity of the spirits, moving first the Diaphragma, and by them the Muscles. Again, there is a laughter called <hi>Sardonius,</hi> which is accompanied vvith a contraction of the Muscles, but this is not sweet, yet it is laughter; and in finging, vvhich is not laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, there is an agitation of the vocall organs, accompanied vvith pleasure. Lastly, whereas he condemneth <hi>Heraclitus, who by his weeping made a hell on earth</hi>; he is deceived: For often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times there is hell in laughing, and a heaven in weeping; in tears there is often delight, and in laughing pain, and as <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> saith, <hi>Madnesse. Aristotle</hi> saith (1. <hi>Rhet.</hi>) That there is in sorrow and tears a certain sense of pleasure; and as <hi>Prudentius</hi> saith,

Teares (saith St. <hi>Ambrose</hi>) feed the mind, and ease the heart, vvhich <hi>David</hi> found vvhen he said, <hi>My tears have been my meat day and night.</hi> Good men therefore found not the uncomfortable attendments of hell in weeping, but rather the comfortable enjoyments of heaven.</p>

                        <hi>III.</hi> The Scripture witnesseth, that Christ wept thrice, but never that he laughed. The Doctor thinks <hi>there is no danger
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:57373:97"/>
to affirm the act and performance of that, whereof we acknowledge the power and essentiall property, and whereby he convinced the doubt of his humanity. Answ.</hi> We deny not but there was in Christ, by reason of his humanity, the faculty of risibility; yet it will not follow that therefore he did actually laugh: For this act is rather a property of levity and folly, then of reason and humanity; therefore we see women more inclined to laughing then men, childhood then old age, and fools then wise men. Neither needed Christ to prove his humanity by laughing, he proved it sufficiently by weeping, which is the first demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strative act of our humanity as soon as we are born; onely <hi>Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roastres</hi> the author of Magick, came like a fool laughing into the World. Again, he saith, <hi>We need not fear to adscribe that to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnat Sun, which is sometimes attributed to the uncarnat Father. Answ.</hi> From a metaphoricall laughing which is adscribed to the Father, to a naturall and reall laughing in the Son, can be no consequence. God laughs figuratively, therefore Christ laughs really, is as good a consequence, as if I should infer, that man flieth naturally, because God is said to flie tropically. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he saith, <hi>It is not reasonable to conclude from Scripture negatively, in points which are not matters of Faith. Answ.</hi> It is true, vvhere the Scripture speaks superficially, and by the way of any thing, divers circumstances are omitted, in which regard we may not conclude negatively; but where the Scripture speaks exactly, as it doth of our Saviour, vve may reason from the negative. For no lesse then four Evangelists write the story of Christ so fully, that they mention all his passions and affections, as his anger, joy, sorrow, pity, hunger, thirst, feare, wearisomnesse, &amp;c. They speak that he mourned three severall times. So when the Prophets describe him, they set him out as a man of sorrowes, acquainted with griefes, smitten of God, and afflicted, woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for our transgressions, bruised for our iniquities, and stric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for our sins. It is strange then, that neither Prophet, Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian, Apostle, nor Evangelist, should speak a word of his laughing, and yet so punctually mention to us his griefs, sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, and weeping: therefore not without cause did <hi>Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome, Austin, Basil, Bernard,</hi> and others, conclude negatively, That Christ never laughed, and yet he did not for this cease to be a Man. For the like is recorded of <hi>Crassus,</hi> Grand-father to that <hi>Crassus</hi> who was killed in the <hi>Parthian</hi> war; who (as is said) never laughed but once. It is also recorded of <hi>Anaxago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras, Aristoxenes, Socrates, Cato, Nerva</hi> the Emperour, and others, that they were never seen to laugh. Besides, seldome or never
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:57373:98"/>
is laughing in Scripture taken in a good sense; it is called mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and like the cracking of thorns: laughing is threatned to end in sorrow, and woe is denounced to those that laugh; but a blessing to the mourners. As for the priority of the heart above the brain, whereof the <hi>Doctor</hi> speaks here, I have already proved out of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and it is plain that in the Scripture it is of greater account then the brain, because this is never men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, but still the heart, let Physitians say what they wil for the brains principality.</p>

                        <hi>IV.</hi> That <hi>Fluctus decumanus, or the tenth wave, is greater or more dangerous then any other, &amp;c. is evidently false.</hi> Here the Doctor troubles himself to no purpose, in refuting the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the tenth wave, and tenth egge: For the tenth of any thing was not counted the greatest, but the greatest of any things was called by the name of <hi>Tenth</hi>; because that is the first perfect number, as consisting of 1, 2, 3 and 4. It was also held a sacred number; therefore the tenth of spoils was dedicated to <hi>Hercules,</hi> and from him called <hi>Herculan,</hi> the tenth of fruits was paid by the Corinthians to <hi>Cyphelus</hi> their King, by <hi>Cyrus</hi> to <hi>Iupiter,</hi> by the Arabians to <hi>Sabis,</hi> and long before by <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> to the true God. When there was yet no po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive law, but the law of Nature. In the number then of Ten, the Ancients conceived there was perfection and excellencie: For Nature perfects man, and brings him into the world the tenth moneth; she hath parted his hands into ten fingers, his feet into ten toes: she hath given him ten passages for evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in three ten dayes the male child is formed in the womb, in foure ten dayes the female: there be ten Heavens; they made up their musick of ten strings, their year of ten moneths, <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo</hi> with the nine Muses made up the full consort, they used to drink but ten times in their Feasts, the womans Dowry anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently was ten <hi>Sestertia</hi> at least; and the greatest ordinarily <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies Sestertium,</hi> that is ten hundred thousand pounds, of our money 7812. l. 10. s. Many other observations may be made of this number; therefore any thing that was greater then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, was called <hi>Decumanum. Porta decumana</hi> was the great gate of the Camp. <hi>Limes decumanus</hi> in grounds, was from East to West; <hi>decumana pyra</hi> in <hi>Pliny,</hi> are great Pears; <hi>Decumatio</hi> was the calling forth of every tenth delinquent in an Army for pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment: And <hi>Lipsius</hi> thinks that from them the great gate of the Camp out of which they went, was called <hi>Decumana.</hi> This number also of <hi>Ten</hi> is musical in Scripture, as may be seen in divers passages thereof.

                           <hi>1. Epicurus,</hi> a wicked and wanton man, impious in his opinions. <hi>Seneca</hi>'s judgement of him. <hi>2.</hi> Twelve of his impious and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd opinions rehearsed.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THe Doctor is very prodigall of his pitie, when he cries out, <hi>Who can but pitie the vertuous Epicurus, who is commonly conceived to place his chiefe felicity in pleasure and sensual delights, &amp;c. But these pleasures were of the mind, not of the body. Gassendus</hi> indeed hath taken much needlesse pains to vindicate <hi>Epicurus</hi> from his errors and impiety; but in this he washeth a Brick, or Blackmore: his chiefe supporter is <hi>Diogenes Laertius,</hi> an obscure Authour in former times: for no ancient Writer speaks of him; and he cites more Philosophers then (it's thought) he ever read. This <hi>Laertius</hi> lived 450. years after <hi>Epicurus,</hi> that is, in the time of <hi>Antonius pius,</hi> about 150. years after Christ; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>Epicurus</hi> lived almost 300. years before our Saviour. Now how he should come to know more of <hi>Epicurus</hi> then those Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers who were contemporary with him, even his own dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, who writ the life and doctrine of that wanton garden Philosopher; is a thing to be questioned, and to indifferent men improbable: For whatsoever <hi>Gassendus</hi> out of this <hi>Laertius,</hi> writes of his commendations, yet we find in the writings of ancient Philosophers among the Gentiles, and primitive Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors among the Christians, that he was a man lewd in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation, and monstrous in his opinions; so that ever since he opened his Schoole till this day, a wanton Atheist is called an Epicure. <hi>Sine vano publica fama.</hi> Sure there could not be so much smoke without some fire; and to say that his contempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary Philosophers, chiefly the Stoicks, should out of malice write untruths of him, is very improbable: For to what end should they doe so? And why more against him then any other? Besides, if he was innocent, why did he not vindicate his own reputation by writing? Why did not his Scholars stand up in
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:57373:99"/>
his defence, how came it that in almost five hundred years he was branded by the tongues and pens of all men, and no man all that while stood up to cleare his reputation, till <hi>Diogines Laertius</hi> produced three of his Epistles, which wise men may think to be fictitious; and the rather because they contradict what his own Scholars, and ancient Philosophers have recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of him. For <hi>Timecrates</hi> his beloved Disciple, and one whom he made one of the Executors of his last will, writes, that with excesse of eating and drinking he used to vomit twice a day. And <hi>Laertius</hi> himself is forced to confesse, that he killed himselfe in the Bath with drinking too much sweet wine, and so he shewed himselfe to be <hi>Epicurus</hi> indeed. He was so decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid the later part of his life, that for many yeares together he could not rise out of his chaire, he had so enervated his body with pleasures, wherein he placed his felicity. Is this the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors vertuous <hi>Epicurus,</hi> who spent every day a <hi>Mina,</hi> vvhich was an hundred <hi>Drachma's,</hi> that is, 3. l. 2. s. 6. d. every <hi>Drachma</hi> being 7. d. ob. I confesse onely <hi>Seneca</hi> among the Stoicks speaks favourably of <hi>Epicurus</hi> his opinion concerning pleasure, as if he meant of mentall delights (<hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de vit. beat.</hi>) yet withall checks him, shewing that his commending of pleasure was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitious, because voluptuous men upon this took occasion to hide their luxury in the bosome of Philosophy, and to cover their wantonnesse with the patrociny and mantle of pleasure: Therefore elsewhere he calls him, The Master of pleasure, and one who too much yeelded to the delights of the body. <hi>Seneca</hi> therefore by speaking favourably of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> would keep off voluptuous men from making him their patron of sensual plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures; and was loath that the sacred name of Philosophy should be bespattered by such an impious professor: His inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this was good, but yet truth should take place. Neither doth the honour of a holy profession depend upon the quality of the professor; though wicked <hi>Iudas</hi> vvas an execrable Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, yet the Apostolicall function is sacred. But perhaps it may be objected, That <hi>Epicurus</hi> did oftentimes use to fast, and content himself with bread and water. I answer, That there is a pleasure sometimes in fasting, as well as in feasting: the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man delights in change; if it were not for abstinence sometimes, we should not know the delight of fulnesse; dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse commends the pleasure of light, and Winter adds to the delights of Summer. There is a vvearisomnesse in continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all feasting, which takes away pleasure. therefore <hi>Epicurus</hi> to maintain an alternate vicissitude of delights, would inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeably
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:57373:99"/>
fast and feast. But his abstinence was to increase the pleasure of his intemperance; and his intemperance was to add delight to his abstinence. Beside that, he was necessitated som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to fast for his healths sake, and enjoyment of a long life, vvhich could not consist in continuall surfeiting. <hi>Seneca (in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistol.)</hi> also reproves <hi>Epicurus</hi> for his inconstancy in saying, That vertue is never without pleasure; and yet affirms that it is not the vertue but the pleasure that makes a man happy. A foolish distinction saith he: For if Vertue be never vvithout that vvhich makes a man blessed, then vertue it selfe is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to beatitude, and that perfectly; for otherwise an imperfect felicity is infelicity. Again, in his Book of Benefits he tells <hi>Epicurus,</hi> That vertue is to be desired for its selfe, not for its pleasure, vvhich he proves out of his own Doctrine of God: though he hath disarmed him of all power, excluded him from all commerce and care of Man, yet he worships him for his greatnesse and goodnesse, though he have no benefit by him, nor is afraid of any hurt from him. Again, he commends many of <hi>Epicurus</hi> his sayings, not because they were his, but because they were common Principles and Tenents used by him, <hi>Non quia Epicuri voces, sed quia publicae.</hi> Another reason he gives, because some sayings are rare and unexpected out of his mouth, whose doctrine and practice was so lascivious: and therefore he commends his sayings more then his actions: he says he was <hi>fortis, sed manuleatus,</hi> a brave man, but vvithal debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched and effeminate; brave in his sayings, but debauched in practice. <hi>Ignava opera Philosopha sententia.</hi> As there be too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny like him, Stoicks in opinion, and Epicureall in conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; by nature saith the Comick, we are all prone to pleasure &amp; lasciviousness, <hi>d labore proclives ad libidinem. Arcesilaus</hi> being asked why so many of other Sects revolted to <hi>Epicurus,</hi> but none fell from him to them, answered, That Cocks can be easily made Capons, but Capons could never become Cocks again. It is easie to become and turn a Priest of <hi>Cybele,</hi> but not so easie to return. <hi>Facilis discensus Averni, sed revocare gradum, superasque evadere ad auras, hoc opus hic labor.</hi> Broad is the way that leadeth to destruction, but the gate to salvation is narrow, and sew en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thereat. <hi>Seneca</hi> also checks that Master of the Revels for saying, In contented poverty there is much honesty: For how can he be poore that is content? It is content that maketh rich, discontent poore. He plainly bids defiance to <hi>Epicurus</hi> his opinion of pleasure, in his fourth book of Benefits, calling his Sect effeminate, umbratick, trencher Philosophers, making ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:57373:100"/>
the hand-maid to pleasures, which ought to be the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse, enslaving her to her Vassals, which she ought to lead, to command, to keep under; he calls it a manifest blindnesse in them to set the Cart before the Horse, to prefer pleasure before Vertue, to set that first which should be last: And not onely is he angry for advancing pleasure, but for joyning it with Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue at all, which scorns pleasures, and accounts them her ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, desiring rather the acquaintance and familiarity of pains and labour, then of such an effeminate happinesse as pleasure. Now that these pleasures of <hi>Epicurus</hi> are not mental, but cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, the same <hi>Seneca</hi> (whom the Doctor cities for his defence) makes it appeare in the 13. Chapter of the same book; Your pleasure, O Epicurus, saith he, is to accustome your tender bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to dull idlenesse, to a sleepy security, in the heat to delight your selves in cold shades, to solace your drooping souls with wanton thoughts, and to cram your lasie karkasses with good meats &amp; drinkes in your shady gardens. Any man therefore may see that <hi>Epicurus</hi> his God was his belly, and gormandising his chiefe happinesse. Wherefore <hi>Athanaeus, lib.</hi> 7. shewes, that he flattered <hi>Idomeneus</hi> and <hi>Metrodorus,</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, for his bellies sake. The same <hi>Seneca</hi> also rejects <hi>Epicurus</hi> his impious opinion of God, whom he makes as idle as himselfe, sitting in another world secure and careless of humane affaires, acting nothing at all, which is <hi>Epicurus</hi> his chiefe happinesse, and tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no notice of our injuries and benefits. If this were so (saith he) the world had been made to solicite such deafe and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent Deities with vowes, supplications, and lifting up of hands: Thou O <hi>Epicurus</hi> (saith he) hast disarmed God, and taken from him all his darts and power, so that he is not to be feared of any; thou hast secluded him from this world by a wal or rampire, so that he can neither see nor feel what is acted here. Hence then it is plain, that <hi>Seneca</hi> was no supporter of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> though he commends some of his moral sentences, not because they were his, but because they were common; and what greater commendation is it for him to speak some good sentences, then for the Devil to utter Scripture phrases. Lastly, <hi>Seneca's</hi> commendations, (if any such be) of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> are of no great moment, seeing with him he doubts of the souls immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality; when he saith, <hi>Illa quae nobis inferos faciunt terribiles fabula est, &amp;c.</hi> Cons. ad Marcian.</p>

                        <hi>II.</hi> But that we may have a more full view of this swinish Philosopher, whom the Doctor commends for his vertue, long life, and many books, we wil poynt at some of his absurd and
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:57373:100"/>
impious tenents, that <hi>Gassendus,</hi> and other phantastical heads of this wanton age, may see what a goodly School of Philosophy they would open here in Christendome. 1. He rejects Logick, calling it, as <hi>Laertius</hi> tells us <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, superfluous, or prepos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous, whereas it is the most usefull of all human Arts or Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; for without Logick we can neither define, nor divide, nor distinguish, we can neither tel the essential nor accidental dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, nor identities of things; we can neither discourse or reason, speak or write methodically, we can inferre no conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion from any premises, nor find out probable and demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive arguments for proof of any thing, nor detect the fallacies and captions that are in mens discourses. But it is no wonder he denys the Art of Reasoning, who knew not what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>eason was; for he confounds it with the senses, as if it had its essence and being in and from them. And in his Epistle to <hi>Phythocles,</hi> he would not have his happy men to meddle with any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or discipline at all. 2. He makes a difference between <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, the Universe and the World; affirming that there is but one Universe, but innumerable Worlds subject to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual generation and corruption; a position repugnant to Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, Philosophy, sense and reason. 3. He makes a certain space between his worlds, which he cals <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>Tully</hi> translates it <hi>intermundium,</hi> there he places his idle and carelesse Gods sleeping securely, as not being troubled with noyse, tumblings and clamours of this tumultuous world. 4. He saith that the Sun, Moon and Starres were made a part by themselves, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, and afterward were palces in this. 5. He will have the just magnitude of the Sun and Starres to depend upon our sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and to be no bigger then they seem to our eye; so that the bignesse of the Sun cannot exceed a foot. 6. He tels us that the Sun every night perisheth, and every day is generated. 7. He acknowledgeth no other happinesse then what consists in the pleasure of tasting, smelling, seeing, hearing, feeling, or venery, as may be seen in <hi>Laertius.</hi> 8. He makes all things to have their existence not by providence, but by hap-hazard of Atoms, and not the bodies of things onely, but the reasonable souls of men also, which he makes subject to uncertainty. 9. He makes all the Gods <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, with humane shapes. 10. He reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> tels us, that there is no qualities in things, but what the senses apprehend; so that the same wine may be both sweet and source, according to the palat that tasts it; and hot water is not hot but coole, if a man conceit it to be so. 11. He makes his doctrine fit for all mens humours; he commends
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:57373:101"/>
wealth to the covetous, discommends it to the prodigall and riotous; he praiseth gormondising to the Glutton, dispraiseth it to the abstenious: he tells the continent venery is hurtful, but to the wanton that it is delightful and pleasant. 12. He she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth himself to be a prophane Atheist in despising Religion, making it a tyrant to keep men in aw, a pernitious device and a scar-crow to terrifie and enslave the vvorld. And now lest any might think that <hi>Epicurus</hi> is wronged, and that these dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable opinions are fathered upon him causlesly, I will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge <hi>Cicero, Plutarch, Lactantius,</hi> and others that have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessedly written against him, but his prime Scholar <hi>Lucretius,</hi> who highly commends him, as being the first that freed the World from the bondage and slavery of Religion: His words are these:

                        <p>
                           <hi>Epicurus</hi> his Atomes rejected by nineteen reasons.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>BEcause the Doctor speaks oftentimes in his Book of Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curean Atomes, which first were hatched in the brains of <hi>Leucippus,</hi> then entertained by <hi>Democritus,</hi> and by him recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to his Scholar <hi>Epicurus</hi>; and because some giddy heads of this age loathing wholsome doctrine, desire to embrace any trash, like women troubled with the <hi>Pica,</hi> who preferre ashes, chalk, coals, tarre, and such like stuffe, to nourishing meats. I will propose to the Readers view, the absurdities of this whim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical opinion concerning Atomes, that they may see how little reason there is to fil young brains with such empty phantosms, and to reject <hi>Aristotles</hi> wholsome and approved Doctrine of Principles. The inventers of these Atomes at first, out of a vain-glory that they might seem singular, rejected the common received principles of naturall Bodies, obtruding on the World their idle dreams; which are greedily embraced by the vain-glorious wits of this age, but upon what grounds let us see: 1. Either many bodies are made up of one atome, or one body of many atomes. But neither are true; not the first, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause an atome is indivisible; not the second, because they cannot unite together in respect of vacuity in which they are distant from each other. 2. It is a maxime among them (saith <hi>Aristotle</hi>) That there is no passibility but by the means of vacuity. Now atomes have no vacuity in them, because they make them solid, therefore they are not subject to passibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; it will follow then, that where there is no passion, there can be no action; for passion is the reception of action, and therefore where no patient is, there no agent can be, because that is wanting on which the agent should act. Hence it will follow, that where there is no action and passion, there can be no generation. 3. There can be no action where there is no contrariety; but contrary qualities are not in atomes: for <hi>Leucippus</hi> (as <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith) placed heat in them, but not cold; hardnesse, but not softnesse; gravity, but not levity. 4. These Atomists contradict themselves: for they hold their atomes impassible, and yet place in them degrees of qualities, making some heavier then others; by which it will follow, that some atomes are hotter then others, and consequently they cannot act one upon another: For the greater heat acts upon the
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:57373:102"/>
lesser, as the stronger upon the weaker. 5. If compounded bodies are made up of atomes, then the qualities which are in these bodies, were first in the atomes, or were not; if not, whence have compounded bodies their qualities, being they are not in their principles? If they are in atomes, either they are singly, so that in each atome there is but one quality, as frigidity in one, hardnesse in another; or else there be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers qualities in one atome. If the first be granted, then it will follow, that each atome hath a different nature from the other, and so no possibility for reception of the quality of another, and consequently no action; if the second be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, then it will follow that atomes are divisible: for there must be one part for reception of one quality, and another part for the other quality. There must be also besides, integrall parts, matter and form, act and passibility, which we call essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall parts; so will it follow, that atomes are compounded bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, which cannot be principles. 6. The uniting of these a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes must be either by themselves, or by another; if by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then they are passible, which is repugnant to <hi>Democritus</hi>; if by themselves, then they are divisible into parts, to wit, into the parts moving, and the parts moved: For nothing can move itselfe; because contrarieties cannot be in the same thing <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum idem.</hi> 7. They make some of the atomes to be soft; it will follow then, that some of them are passive: for soft things are apt to receive impressions, and so to suffer. 8. If these a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes be smooth and round, as some will have them, they can no more unite to make up a mixt body, then so many small seeds or grains, which onely make up a body aggregate, as a heap of stones; but if they be rough, cornerd, or hooked, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers say, then they are divisible, and so not atomes. 9. If there be innumerable worlds, as <hi>Epicurus</hi> holds, and innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable atomes must concurre to make up any one of these Worlds, how many innumerable atomes are there to make up innumerable Worlds? There must needs be more atomes then Worlds, and consequently degrees of more and lesse in innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merability and infinity, then which nothing can be more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd. 10. If all things are made of atomes, to what end was seed given to vegitables and animals for procreation? What needs the Husbandman sow corn, or the Gardiner cast his seeds into the ground? What needs he dig or plow, plant, &amp; water, whereas all fruits, herbs and plants, can be produced by atomes? Birds, saith <hi>Lactantius,</hi> need not lay eggs, nor sit upon them for procreation, seeing of atomes both eggs and bird
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:57373:102"/>
can be produced. 11. The souls and their faculties are made of finer and smaller atomes then the bodies which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of a grosser sort. It must then follow they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of magnitude, and consequently divisibility. 12. Those atomes have neither knowledge, reason, wisdome, nor coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, and yet can produce by hap-hazard, worlds and all things in them, which neither Men nor Angels can effect by their wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. 13. If the statue or picture of a man cannot be effected, but by art, reason, &amp; wisdom, what impudency is it, saith <hi>Lactan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> to affirm man himselfe by chance to be made, or by a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merarious and fortuitall conglobation of atomes. 14. We see the World and the creatures therein governed, not temerari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, but by an admirable providence and wisdome, how then can any imagine these should be made by chance, and not by wisdome. <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 15. I would know whether Towns, Castles, Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, Ships, &amp; other buildings, are made up of atomes? If these are not, how shall we believe that celestiall or sublunary bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, or the whole World should be made of them. 16. When <hi>Epicurus</hi> gives to his atomes magnitude, figure and weight, hee makes them perfect bodies, and consequently unapt for Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call mixtion: For the uniting of perfect bodies makes up an aggregative body; so that in the generation of bodies there is no mixtion but aggregation, which is ridiculous. 17. Hee gives figures to his atomes, and yet makes them invisible, which is a plain Bull and contradiction: For an invisible figure is like an invisible colour, an inaudible sound, an inodorable smell, an ungustible sapor, an untangible hardnesse. To make the senses proper objects insensible, is a senslesse toy. 18. He makes his atomes move downward in a straight line, by reason of their gravity; but fearing lest by this motion there would never be any concurring of them for generation, he assignes them in another motion, which he calls declination, and so to one simple invisible indivisible body, he gives two motions, but tells us not the cause of this motion of declination, which as <hi>Tully</hi> saith, argues his grosse ignorance in Natural Philosophy: For I would know whether this motion be from an internal or external cause; not from an internall, for there is no other internal cause of the atomes motion downward, but gravity, which cannot produce two motions; the cause cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, because <hi>Epicurus</hi> his Gods doe not move or work at all: Beside that, his Gods are also made of atomes, as <hi>Cicero</hi> shews. 19. Most ridiculously did he invent this motion of Declina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, lest he should seem to deprive man of his liberty of will:
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:57373:103"/>
For he thought mans will must needs be necessitated, if those atomes of which the soul is made, should have no other motion but downward, which is a naturall and necessary motion. And by the same means also he took away Fate or providence. Thus have I briefly touched the absurdities of this opinion, which is so hugged, and greedily swallowed without chew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by some unsetled and vain-glorious men, not regarding the dangerous consequences arising thence, nor the impiety of the Authour, being both an Atheist and a prophane wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, and unsetled in his opinions, saying and unsaying at his pleasure: For when he saw the envie and danger he had brought upon himselfe by his impious Dictates, he swee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens them a little in effect, as <hi>Tully</hi> saith, denying all Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and yet in words allowing Divine Worship, which is most ridiculous: to pray and praise, to feare and love, to serve and worship such Gods as neither love nor hate us, such as take no notice of our good and evill, such as have no relation to us, nor we to them. So he palliates sometimes his swinish pleasures with the delights of the mind, clothing a foul Strumpet with the habit of a modest Matron; whereas by the delight of the minde, he meant nothing else but men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall thoughts, or the delightfull remembrance of his fleshly pleasures, which we leave to him and his Disciples, <hi>Epicuri de grege porcis.</hi>

Of this opinion is the Doctor (<hi>Book</hi> 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> .) but his reasons are not satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory: For first (saith he) <hi>Minerall spirits resist congelation, but Ice is water congealed by cold. Answ.</hi> He takes this for
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:57373:103"/>
granted which is not: For he is to prove Crystal a mineral, and that 'tis hardned by a mineral spirit, which he doth not. Again, all Minerals resist not congelation, but further it some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times as he sheweth himselfe of Snow and Salt by the fire side turned into Ice, and of water converted into Ice, by Salt-pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Besides, all minerals are not hard; for Quicksilver is not, nor can mineral spirits harden their own bodies or keep them from dissolving into liquor, it is the external heat or cold that doth it, not the internal spirit, as we see in Salt, which dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves into water if it be not hardned by the heat of Sun or fire, and so will Ice dissolve into water, if the cold grow remiss or the heat prevaile. If then a Mineral spirit cannot harden its own body, how can it harden the body of water? What mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral spirits are there in cold water to harden it into Ice? Spirits are hot, therfore apter to dissolve water then harden it; but we see manifestly that it is cold and not spirits which causeth Ice: the same cold in some Caves where the Sun never comes, nor heat, converteth water-drops into stones, and the cold of some waters metamorphise stickes, leaves and trees, pieces of lether, nut-shels, and such like stuffe into stones; why then may not cold convert Ice into a higher degree of hardnesse, and prepare it for reception of a new forme, which gives it the essence and name of Crystall. 2. [A li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quation in Crystal may be effected, but not without some dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty; but Ice may dissolve in any way of heat.] <hi>Answ.</hi> The difficult melting of the one, and easie liquation of the other, wil not prove that Crystal was not Ice, but that it is notice. For as <hi>Scaliger</hi> saith, <hi>Valde à seipso differt quod fit, dum sit, &amp; cum est,</hi> Ice before it attains the hardnesse of a stone, or Crystall, is yet water formally, and Crystal onely materially, or in the way of preparation. But when it ceaseth to be ice, it assumes the form of crystal, and wil not deny its original, that it was once Ice, which now is a stone. The matter then of cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stal, is water, and it is made of Ice, because it was water, by which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>e it hath stept up to the forme of a stone. 3. <hi>They are differenced by supernatation, or floating upon water, for cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stal will sink, but ice will swim in water. Answ.</hi> Its no wonder to see a stone sink, and ice swim; for crystal when it was ice, swimmed, being now a stone, sinks; as being a body more compact, hard, solid, and ponderous: so a stick will swim, but when it is converted to a stone, it sinks. The argument there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is good thus: Crystal sinks, Ice swims, therefore crystal is not ice; but it will not follow, therfore crystal was not ice.

4. <hi>They are distinguished in substance of parts, and the accidents thereof, that is, in colour and figure, for ice is a fimilary body, but the body of crystal is mixed, and containeth in it sulphure, for being struck with steel, it sends forth sparks, which are not caused by collision of two hard bodies, but they are inflamable effluences discharged from the bodies collided; for a steel and flint being both met, will not readily strike fire. Answ.</hi> Crystal is not so much distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished either in substance or accidents, from ice, as a chick is from an egge, and yet the chick was an egg.</p>
                     <p>What wonder is it, if crystal having received a new form, be distinguished from ice, whereas we see greater distinctions daily in our own nutrition, our bloud, flesh, and bones, have neither the colour, figure, or substance of corn, fruits, hearbs, roots, and other meats we feed upon. In the same rose-leaf there be distinct qualities and operations, one part being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stringent, the other laxative; the same Rhubarb as it is diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently prepared, differently worketh, one way by loosning, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother way by binding the belly. Let us not deny that distinction to a natural, which we give to an artificial pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration; there are distinct colours in one and the same leaf of a gillyflower, or tulip. Again, when he saith, <hi>That Ice is a similary body, but Crystal is mixed</hi>; Here is no opposition, for similary and dissimilary, are opposite<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not similary and mixed, for a similary body may be mixed; so is flesh, so is bloud, so is ice, except he will make it a pure element. And when he saith, <hi>Crystal containeth sulphure in it</hi>; This is very unlikely, for sulphure is hot and inflamable, it is also viscous and fat, it is of a piercing quality and of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful smel, none of which qualities we finde in cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stal. In fiery mountains there is most sulphure, in snowy mountains, most crystal; but his reason to prove there is sulphure in crystal, is invalid, because saith he, <hi>being struck with steel, it sends forth sparks</hi>; by this reason he may prove there is sulphure in every hard thing, even in wood and sticks, for by attrition, or any other violent motion, they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slamable, as the <hi>Americans</hi> know, who use no other way to kindle their fires, but the attrition of sticks. Arrows will burn in the air, their Lead will melt, bels, mil-stones, and cart-wheels, will grow extream hot with motion, and so wil water; is there sulphure in all these? And here he contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts himself, when he saith, <hi>That the sparks are not sent forth by collision of two hard bodies, but they are inflamable effluences dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from the bodies collided.</hi> I would know how these effluences
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:57373:105"/>
can be discharged, if the bodies be not collided, and how they can bee collided without collision. These sparks then are doubtlesse the accension of the aire, and aerial parts of these hard bodies, by motion and collision, being no way hindered by wetting the Steele and Flint, for I have tried the contrary by wetting both, and yet the Sparks fly out as readily, as if both had been dried; so they will out of Flints taken out of Rivers, where they have been perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally moist, so that the sparks are not quenched at their erupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, because the air is not wet, though the Steel and Flint be. 5. <hi>They are</hi> (saith he) <hi>differenced in the places of their generation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For Crystall is found in Regions where Ice is seldom seen Answ.</hi> It is sufficient that in those Regions where Crystall is found, Ice is sometimes seen; and as Ice is there but seldome seen, so Crystal is there but seldome found: The best and greatest quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities are found in cold and snowy Countries. Again, though in those hotter Countries the air above is warm, yet in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels of the earth it is as cold, or rather colder, then elsewhere by antiperistasis; and that is sufficient to prove Crystal may be there generated. 6. <hi>They have contrary qualities elementall; and uses medicinall. Answ.</hi> It is true, Ice is moist, and Crystall dry: so water is moist, and salt is dry; will it therefore follow, that salt is not generated of water? Allum, Salt-peter, Vitriol, are all hard and dry, so are the bones in our flesh, the teeth in our gums, the stones in fruits, yet all are begot of soft and moist materials. As for their contrary medicinall uses, I question not, whereas there are in one and the same simple (as I shewed but now) contrary effects.</p>

                        </gap> stones and other hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy bodies downward, is to enjoy their Matrix, or Center: but no end can be assigned why the Loadstone should draw or move towards the Iron <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the motion therefore is in the Iron, and other metals, which are moved to the Loadstone, as to their Matrix, saith <hi>Scaliger</hi>; therefore it is no more wonder for Iron to move to the Loadstone, then to move downwards, the end and efficient cause being the same in both motions, to
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:57373:106"/>
wit, the enjoyment of their proper place or matrix. 2. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the ancients held that garlick hindred the attaction of the Loadstone, he contradicts this by experience; but I cannot think the ancient Sages would write so confidently of that which they had no <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> experience of, being a thing so ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious and easie to try; therefore I suppose they had a stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger kind of garlick, then is with us, which made <hi>Horace</hi> write so invectively against it, calling it poison and worse then hemlock. 3. He denies the vertue of the Adamant in hindring the Loadstones attraction, which the Ancients affirm. It seems our diamonds have not this vertue, but this is no sufficient reason to deny the vertue of the Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant, for though our diamond be a kind of Adamant, yet it is not that kind which the Ancients speak of; for <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> reckoneth six kinds of Adamants. 4. He takes <hi>Versoria</hi> in <hi>Plautus,</hi> with <hi>Turnebus,</hi> for the rope that turns about the ship; but if <hi>versoria</hi> there signifies a rope, it must be false La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, for <hi>funis</hi> must be understood, therefore <hi>Plautus</hi> would rather have said <hi>versorius</hi>; but I rather take it with <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph Scaliger,</hi> upon <hi>Manilius,</hi> and with <hi>Pineda,</hi> for a turning back and taking the contrary way: so that it is an adjective, and <hi>via</hi> is to be understood; the same phrase <hi>Plautus</hi> useth in <hi>Trinummi,</hi> when <hi>Stasimus</hi> bids <hi>Charmides</hi> return to his master, <hi>cape versoriam recipe te ad herum</hi>; or else <hi>versoria</hi> is taken for the helm by which the ship is turned about. 5. <hi>He will not have amber a vegitable, but a mineral concretion, as is delivered by</hi> Boe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius. <hi>Answ. Boetius</hi> delivers, that there are three sorts of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, to wit, minerals, animals, and vegitables, the first is begot of a bituminous exhalation or oil; the second of the fat of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals, the third of the gum of trees; he tels us also that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause oftentimes in Amber are found spiders, flies, and other insects, with pieces of sticks and straws, which the gum fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling from the trees, might lick up, or involve. That all Amber is vegitable, and the juice of trees, even that which is gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the sea, because saith he, much land hath been drowned by the sea, and gained from the sea again, as he shews of the <hi>Netherlands. Cardan</hi> denies not but all Amber is the juice of trees, yet made bituminous by the heat of the sea; and <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muth</hi> upon Pancerol, tels us, that the Ancients called that only Amber, which distilled from the trees, whence Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> cals it the tears of the shrub; therefore though it be th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

a Minerall, but a Vegitable, as having its originall and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence from Vegitables. <hi>Scaliger</hi> writes, That there is a kind of black Amber gathered in those Seas where there is greatest store of Whales; and therefore Amber is called Whale by the inhabitants of <hi>Morocco</hi> and <hi>Fez,</hi> as believing that it is a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance proceeding from the Whale: But whether it be true Amber, may be doubted, and I do not find that among the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients <hi>Succinum</hi> signified any thing else, but the Gum of Trees, concrete into a solid substance, and of this mind is <hi>Petrus Bello<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> in his Observations.</p>

All Adamants are not of the same kind, for <hi>Pliny</hi> as we have already said, reckoneth six sorts of them; and I think it is no greater wonder for bloud to soften a stone, then for water to harden a piece of Leather, or a stick into a stone. 2.

As for the Loadstone, if it imparts its vertue, it parts also with its substance, but in so small a quantity that its scarce perceptible; but the gold ought to impart much vertue to cure the disease, and consequently much of its substance, which would be seen by the weight and the cure; but neither is sensible, and therefore no deperdition, but imaginary. 3. He cannot apprehend how an iron should grow red hot by motion, since in swinging a red hot iron, it wil grow cold. <hi>Answ.</hi> That violent motions will excite heat and fire in hard bodies, we have already shewed in divers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples; <hi>Aristotle</hi> proves it by. the example of Arrows, whose Lead will melt with the heat and motion thereof, in that part of the air, which is near the fire (<hi>de coelo, l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 7.) <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil</hi> confirms the same, speaking of that Arrow which <hi>Acestes</hi> shot, that it took fire in the motion. <hi>Namque volans liquidis in nu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Answ. Boetius</hi> in his second Book of stones and gems, <hi>c.</hi> 153. tels us, that Coral doth not harden or grow stony till it be dead; it seems then, whilst it is alive, its soft under water, and therefore this Diver lighted upon a dead Coral; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that was hard, it will not follow that all Coral under water is hard, except all under water be dead. There is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so a difference between old and young plants, the older the plant grows, the harder it is; perhaps this was not only dead but also an old plant: Its no wonder then if Coral petrifie when taken out of the sea, for then it dieth being separated from its matrix and element, in which it had life and veg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He likes not the opinion of the Ancients, concerning the generation of Viscum or Misseltoe, to wit, that it is bred upon trees from seeds let fall there by thrushes, and ring-doves; his reasons are, <hi>because it grows only upon some trees, and not in</hi> Ferrara, <hi>where these birds are found, and because the seed thereof being sown, it
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:57373:109"/>
will not grow again, and in some trees it groweth downwards under the boughs, where seed cannot remain.

                        </gap>cence of viscous or superflous sap, as <hi>Scaliger</hi> writes, may be true also. Many things are procreated both with and without seeds; there is an equivocall generation both in vegitables and animals, which the learned Poet knew when he writ of this Viscum, saying, <hi>Soletfronde vivere nova quod non sua seminat arbos.</hi> Now the reason why it groweth not upon all trees, and in all Countries, is, because as the same Poet saith, <hi>Non omnia fert omnia tellus,</hi> there is not a disposition in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of all trees to receive this form, nor in the climate or soile to animate this seed. Yet <hi>Mathiolus</hi> observes, that in <hi>Hetruria,</hi> where is greatest store of Thrushes, there is greatest pleny of Misseltoe, which shews, that this plant hath its originall from the seeds mixed with the excrements of those birds; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the old proverb was not untrue, <hi>Turdus sibi malum cacat,</hi> even in the literall sense; and so where this Viscum is meerly an excrescence, it may grow downwards under boughes, where no seeds can come or remain. 6. <hi>He can deny that a Snake will not endure the shade of an Ash; Pliny</hi> and other ancients affirm it, perhaps upon surer grounds then the Doctor denies it; for though here in these cold Countries our Snakes may accord with our Ashes, yet it may be otherwise in hot Regions, where the Serpents are more venemous, and the Ash-leaves more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull: why may there not be somewhat in the shade of an Ash repugnant to the Serpent, whereas the leaves and juice thereof are such Antidotes against poyson, as <hi>Dioscorides</hi> and <hi>Mathiolus</hi> shew? <hi>Cardan</hi> tels us, That in <hi>Sardinia</hi> the shadow of the <hi>Rodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daphne</hi> is pernitious to those that sleep under it, making them mad. He instanceth the dangerous qualities proceeding from the shadowes of some other trees; and <hi>Lucretius</hi> affirms.

In Aulul.</hi> And yet I am of <hi>AElians</hi> opinion, That it is not so much for the gold they fight, as for their young ones, which men use to carry away vvhen they search the Countrey for gold. Neither was <hi>Aristaeus</hi> the first that affirmed these Griffins, as the Doctor saith; for we read of them in <hi>Leviticus</hi> and <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> which though <hi>Tremellius</hi> and wee use not, but the word <hi>Ossifrage,</hi> yet the Hebrew word <hi>Peres</hi> is translated Griffi by the Septuagints, by the old Latin, by <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom</hi> and <hi>Pagmin,</hi> by <hi>Arias Montanus,</hi> and by the <hi>Italian</hi> version: And if <gap reason="foreign">

For the <hi>Gyraffa,</hi> or <hi>Camelopardalis,</hi> is of a stranger composition, being made of the Libbard, Buffe, Hart, and Camell. Besides, though some fabulous narrations may be added to the story of the Griffins, as of the one-ey'd <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimaspi</hi> with whom they fight, yet it follows not that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there are no Griffins. If any man say, That now such a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals are not to be seen; I answer, It may be so, and yet not perished: for they may be removed to places of more remote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and security, and inaccessible to men: for many such places there are in the great and vast Countries of <hi>Scythia,</hi> and <hi>Tartaria,</hi> or <hi>Cathaia,</hi> vvhither our <hi>Europeans</hi> durst never, nor could venture.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>
                           <hi>1.</hi> The existence of the Phoenix proved by divers reasons: and the contrary objections refelled: the strange generation of some birds. <hi>2.</hi> The Ancients cleared concerning the Phoenix, and whether the Phoenix be mentioned in Scripture. Divers sorts of generation in divers creatures. The Conclusion, with an Admonition not to sleight the Ancients opinion and Doctrine.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>BEcause the Doctor following the opinion of <hi>Pererius, Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nandus de Cordova, Francius,</hi> and some others, absolutely denies the existence of the <hi>Phoenix,</hi> I will in some few positions set down my opinion concerning this bird. 1. I grant that some passages concerning this bird are fabulous,; as that he is seen but once in 500 years, that there is but one onely in the World; or if there be two, that the old Phoenix is buried by the younger at <hi>Heliopolis.</hi> 2. These fabulous narrations doe not prove there is no such bird, no more then the fables that are written of Saint <hi>Francis,</hi> prove that there was never any such man. 3. Nor doth it follow, that there is no such bird, because some write, they never read of any who had seen a Phoenix; for though these few vvho vvrite of this bird, did never see him in a picture, yet the AEgyptians, from whom they had the knowledge of the Phoenix, did see him. <hi>Tacitus</hi> writes, That no man doubts but that this bird is sometime seen in AEgypt, <hi>Aspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci aliquando in AEgypto hanc volucrem non ambiguitur, Ann. l.</hi> 6. There are some creatures in <hi>Africa</hi> and the <hi>Indies,</hi> that were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver seen by any of those who writ their histories, the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge whereof they have onely by relation from the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants. 4. Though <hi>AEgypt</hi> vvas the mother of many fictions, as <hi>Pererius</hi> sheweth, yet it vvill not follow that the Phoenix is a fiction, or that AEgypt vvas not also the School of many truths; for the Graecians from thence had the their knowledge and vvisdom, <hi>Orpheus, Homer, Musaeus,</hi> the Poets; <hi>Lycu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

That there is but one Phoenix, is not against Philosophy and Logick, which teacheth us, That the species can be preserved in one individuall, <hi>Pererius</hi> sheweth, That this is only true in things incorruptible, as in the Sun and Moon; but I say, That this is true also in things subject to corruption; for in these, though the individuals be corruptible, yet the species are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal;
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:57373:111"/>
and it skils not how few the particulars be, so long as the species can be preserved in one; and though there be no individuall actually existent, yet the species can be preserved; for in Winter the species of Roses is not perished, though there be no individuall Roses actually existent; for even then they have their being and essence, though their existence be but po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentially in the ashes, as the forms of the elements are in the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xed bodies, or as the form of a cock is in the egg, which by the heat of: the hen or Sun, is actually educed. 6. Whereas <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>rerius</hi> holdeth it inconvenient, that so noble a species as the Phoenix is, should have but one individual, subject to so many dangers; I answer, That in all beasts and birds, the nobler the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies is, the fewer are the individuals; there are not so many Eagles as Doves, nor Elephants as Rabbets, and Nature is so provident in the conservation of the species, that vvhere there be few of the kind, they live long, and have their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode in some remote rocks, mountains, Islands and Desarts, from the dangers they are subject to by men, as Eagles, and the Phoenix, which is seen but seldom. Now multitude of indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals doth not argue the nobility of the species, but rather im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection; for it proceeds from the division of the matter, whereas unity noteth perfection, as issuing from the act and form of things. 7. Whereas <hi>Fernander</hi> sheweth, it's a miracle that the Phoenix can never be taken dead or alive; I answer, It is a miracle in nature, and we know there be many naturall se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets and miracles: is it not a miracle that the <hi>Manucodiata,</hi> or bird of Paradise, is found dead somet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath given to each creature so much policie, as to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>rom danger; and the fewer there be of that kind, the more wary and cautelous they are; and if it be true that <hi>Pliny</hi> and others write of the Ravens, that their nests can never be found, it is a great miracle, which perhaps may be so in <hi>Italy</hi>; yet in the rocks of <hi>Norway, Shetland,</hi> and other Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern places, their Nests <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="203" facs="tcp:57373:111"/>
admired, that Ravens use to flye to the places where dead bodies are, and by a strange instinct have knowledge of the bodies dying two dayes before they be dead; and I think there is as great a miracle in the Loadstone, as there is in the Phoenix. 8. It is as possible for a Phoenix to arise out of the ashes of the dead parent, as for a silk-worm to proceed out of the Egge of the dead Worm. If any reply, That the one is perfect, the other imperfect; I answer, That every thing is perfect in its own kind, and in generation; Nature looks not at the perfection or imperfection of the creature, but to the aptitude and disposition of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to receive such a form, Again, a Cock, which is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect creature, is excluded out of the Egge by the heat of the Sun, or Fire; and <hi>Scaliger</hi> speaks of a bird that was found in a shell, the learned men of that time concluded, That the Oyster was turned into a bird. I take it to be as great a wonder for a Mule, which is a perfecter creature then a bird, to be generated of the seed of another kind, the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> that the Phoenix should arise out of the putrified ashes; That the Clakgeese are generated of trees in the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seas, beyond <hi>Scotland,</hi> is not altogether fabulous; the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>nts thereabout at this day constantly believe it. They are observed every year to flye from the North to <hi>Shetland</hi> and <hi>Crkney,</hi> where I have been; in the beginning of Winter they come thither, in the Spring they flye away North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in flocks, which must be to <hi>Norway</hi> or <hi>Gree<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e ever yet found. Besides, bodies of old trees that have been driven upon these Islands by the winds, have had upon them the full proportion and shape of those birds. And why should this be more incredible then that which <hi>Scaliger</hi> writes of a certain tree in the river <hi>Iuverna,</hi> whose leaves falling into the water, receive the form &amp; shape of fishes, and life with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all; and of that tree in the Isle <hi>Cimbulon,</hi> whose leaves falling on the ground, move themselves backward &amp; forward; being touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they go back: one of these was kept 8 dayes alive in a plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. 9. Whereas <hi>Fernandus</hi> asketh, whether every parcell of the dead Phoenix his ashes hath an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> aptitude to become a new Phoenix; if it hath, then (saith hee) there is more then one Phoenix; if it have not, what is the reason that one part of these ashes should have this aptitude, and not the other; I answer, All that heap of ashes is but one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, of which is produced one Phoenix, as one bird out
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:57373:112"/>
of one egge, and not many out of the severall parts thereof. 10. Though <hi>Aristotle</hi> and some others make no mention of the Phoenix, it will not f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>llow that therefore there is no such bird extant; for there are many kinds of creatures of which they write not. 11. It is likely that the bird <hi>Semenda</hi> in the <hi>Indies,</hi> vvhich burneth her self to ashes, out of which springs another bird of the same kind, is the very same with the old Phoenix. 12. The testimony of so many Writers, especially of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, proving by the Phoenix the Incarnation of Christ, and his Resurrection, and withall our resuscitation in the last day; doe induce me to believe there is such a bird, else their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments had been of small validity among the Gentiles, if they had not believed there was such as bird. What wonder is it, saith <hi>Tertullian,</hi> for a virgin to conceive, when the Eastern bird is generated without copulation, <hi>Peribunt h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>mines, avibus Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biae de resurrectione sua securis.</hi> Shall men utterly perish (saith he) and the birds of <hi>Arabia</hi> be sure of their resurrection? The existence of this bird is asserted by <hi>Herodotus, Seneca, Mela, Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus, Pliny, Solinus, AElian, Lampridius, Aur. Victor, Laertius, Sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi> and others of the Gentile-Writers. The Christian Doctors who affirm the same, are, <hi>Clemens, Romanus, Tertullian, Eusebius, Cyril</hi> of Jerusalem, <hi>Epiphanius, Nazianzenus, Ambrose, Augustine, Hierom, Lactantius,</hi> and many others.</p>
                     <p>Now out of what we have spoken, we can easily answer the Doctors objections whic he hath collected out of <hi>Pererius, Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riundes, Franzius,</hi> and others, as first, when he saith, That <hi>none of those who have written of the Phoenix, are oculary describers thereof.</hi> Ans. Neither vvas <hi>Aristotle, Gesner, Aldrovandus,</hi> and others, vvho have vvritten largely of beasts, birds, and Fishes ocular vvitnesses of all they vvrote: they are forced to deliver much upon hear-say and tradition: So those that vvrite the later stories of American and Indian animals, never saw all they vvrite of. Secondly when he saith, [That <hi>Herodotus, Taci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> and <hi>Pliny,</hi> speak so dubiously, that they overthrow the whole relation of the <hi>Phoenix.</hi>] <hi>Answ. Herodotus</hi> doubteth not of the existency of the Phoenix, but onely of some circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces delivered by the Heliopolitans, to wit, that the younger Phoenix should carry his Father wrapt up in Myrrh, to the Temple of the Sun, and there bury him; so <hi>Tacitus</hi> denieth not the true Phoenix, but onely saith, That some hold the Phoenix there described, which was seen in the dayes of <hi>Ptolomy</hi> in AE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, not the right Phoenix spoken of by the Ancients. The words of <hi>Pliny</hi> are falsified by the Doctor, who cites them thus:
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:57373:112"/>
                        <hi>Sed quae falsa esse nemò dubitabit</hi>: whereas the words are, <hi>Sed quem falsum esse nemo dubitabit</hi>: So that he doth not say, That what is written of the Phoenix is false; but onely that this Phoenix which was brought to <hi>Rome</hi> in the Consulship of <hi>Claudius,</hi> was false, and not the right one. 3. He saith, <hi>That they who discourse of the Phoenix, deliver themselves diversly, contrarily, or contradictorily. Answ.</hi> There is no contradiction except it be (<hi>ad idem</hi>) most of them agree in the substance, that there is a Phoenix, they onely differ in the accidents and circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of age, colour, ann place. We must not deny all simply that is controverted by Writers: for so we might deny most points both in Divinity and Philosophy. 4. He saith the word Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nix in <hi>Iob</hi> 29.48. <hi>can have no animall fignification, because there is expressed</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, the trunk of the Palm-tree; and the Hebrew word is by <hi>Tremellius</hi> rendred <hi>Sand. Answ.</hi> The same which properly signifieth the trunk of the Palm, may me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphorically be meant of the body of the Phoenix. For the same word in Greek is given both to the Palm and Phoenix; for as the one is long green, so the other is long-lived: but the Hebrew word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> hhol in that place, though expounded <hi>Sand</hi> by <hi>Tremellius.</hi> yet signifieth a Phoenix, as both <hi>Pagnin, Monta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, Buxtorsius,</hi> and other Hebricians affirm; and so doth <hi>R. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> with other ancient Hebrewes expound this Text of the Phoenix, consonant to which is the Tygurin Version, so <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian; Philippus Presbyter,</hi> and <hi>Cajetan</hi> expound this place of the Phoenix, being the symbole of our resurrection, &amp; of a long life. And it seems that the word Phoenix is more consonant to the Text then <hi>Sand,</hi> because <hi>Iob</hi> speaks of his nest: <hi>I shall die in my nest</hi> (saith he) <hi>and shall multiply my dayes as the Phoenix.</hi> 5. He saith, [That the existence of the Phoenix is repugnant to the Scripture, which affirms, there went of every sort two at the least into the Ark. It infringeth also the benediction of multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. For they cannot be said to multiply who do not transcend an unity.] <hi>Answ.</hi> When the Scripture speakes of two that entred into the Ark of every sort, it means of those that were distinguished into male and female<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the end why these went in by couples, was for procreation, now the Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nix hath no distinction of Sex, and therefore continueth not his species by copulation, as other creatures do. Hence though he enters into the Ark, it was not needfull he should be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med among those that went in by couples and sevens. For how could hee that was but one, be said to goe in two and two, or male and female. As for the benediction of multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
<pb facs="tcp:57373:113"/>
it was not pronounced or enjoyned to the Phoenix, which was not capable of it, God having supplied the want of that with another benediction equivalent, which was a longer life then other animals, and a peculiar way to continue the species without multiplication of the <hi>Individuum.</hi> 6. He saith, <hi>That to animal generation is required the concurrence of two Sexes, and therefore such as have no distinction of Sex, engender not at all, as Aristotle conceives of Eeles, and testatious animals. Ans. Aristotle de gen.animal. l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 10. shewes that there no distinction of sex in divers Fishes, and Bees, which notwithstanding generate. But when he speaks of Eels in <hi>historia animal,</hi> he shews they do not generate at all, not because they want distinction of sex, as the Doctor saith; for he speaks of divers creatures that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate without that distinction; but because there is not in them <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, a production or generation of egges or spawn; for all those kind of Fishes, saith he, which generate, have spawn or egges in them, which Eels want. Again, he shews in his first book <hi>de gener. animal. c.</hi> 1. That sanguine creatures are distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished into male and female except a few, saith he: If then there be some sanguine animals without sex, what wonder is it if the Phoenix have none? As for testacious animals, they want distinction of sex, because they are, as he saith, <hi>Immoveable alone,</hi> and stick to rocks, having as it were the life of plants, and therefore are no other wise distinguished into male and female then plants are, which is not properly but analogically. 7. He argueth, <hi>That if the worm into which the Phoenix is corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, becommeth a Phoenix, this would confound the generation of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and imperfect animals, and the lawes of Nature.</hi> Again, <hi>the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of venerous animals is not from a corruption of themselves, but rather a seminal and specifical diffusion. Answ.</hi> The generation of the Phoenix is no confusion or disturbance of Natures laws, which delights in variety of productins. Therefore in plants we see some produced by their seed, some by their roots with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out seed; some by their stems onely without root or seeds; some without any of these, imm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Some by coition of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent kinds, as Mules; some without coition, by affriction one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as divers Fishes; some are produced by the female without the male, as the fish <hi>Erythi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="207" facs="tcp:57373:113"/>
in the mud, as Eels; some without coition, but within the body of the parents, as Bees: And lastly, the Phoenix is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got without coition, of its own putrified body, at which the Doctor wonders how it should be, [seeing the generation of Insects is not by corruption of themselves, but rather a seminall effusion.] To which I answer with <hi>Aristotle,</hi> speaking of Bees, that as they have a proper and peculiar kind of Nature diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring from all other creatures, so it was fit they should have <gap reason="foreign">

                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">I. <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat Fishes have no breathing, or respiration, is manifest, 1. Because they want Lungs, and other Instruments of breathing: For, though they may receive aire in at the mouth, and let it out again by their gills; yet this is not respiration, which is the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Lungs, Wind-pipe, and Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragma in attracting the air for refrigera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and emitting the same. 2. There is no air under or in the water, therefore fishes cannot breath there. For this cause terrestriall creatures die in the waters for want of air, as fishes die in the air for want of water. If any will say, That man dieth in the water, not for want of aire there, but for want of gills, or some other passage to let out the water received into the lungs; I answer, The Dolphin hath a passage, or
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:57373:117"/>
Fistula to let out the water; and yet there he could not live without suffocation, if he did not now and then elevate his head above the water to draw breath. If it be be again ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, That water is a body mixt with air, therefore Fishes doe breath; I answer, That so is wine which we drink, mixed with more air then water is; yet if we did not draw the air above, we should be quickly choked. The quantity of air in the water is so little, that it is discernable by Art onely, not by the senses: and so there is some water in that air which we breath; yet we are not said to breath water, but air. Again, if there were air in the water which the fishes drew, bubbles would appear upon the super<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>icies thereof, as we see in Mice, or other terrestriall creatures drownd in the water: For as soon as the water fils the breast and lungs, it draws out the air, which tending upward towards the super<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>cies, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>auseth bubbles. If it be objected, That fishes breath, and yet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ake no bubbling, because the air hath a free passage through the gills; I answer, That the freenesse of passage is no hinderance to bubbling, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any light agitation of the water will make bubbles, when it hath received air within ir, and so we deny not but fishes may make the water bubble, not by their breathing, but by their motion. 3. If fishes breath air in the water, why doe they die when they are in the air? If any say, It is because they cannot endure the coldnesse of the air; I answer, That the water is colder then the air. Again, we see, that the hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the air is, the fishes die the sooner. Hence it is observed, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>els live longer in a Northern then in a Southern wind, and these live longer out of the water then other fishes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause their heat is in a more viscid and slimy humidity then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Hence it is, that the parts cut off doe live and move sometime, because their heat is not easily dissipated in so slimy a matter. But some will object, That fishes out of the water gape for air, therefore they breath. <hi>Answ:</hi> To gape, or open the mouth, is no argument of breathing, except we will give respiration to Oysters which sometimes gape. Again, fishes gape not for air, but for water: so men in the water being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most stilled, gape, not for water, but for air. <hi>Object.</hi> 2. The air penetrateth into the thick earth, therefore much more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the thin water. <hi>Answ.</hi> I deny that air can penetrate into the thick parts of the earth; for that were to make penetration of dimensions, but onely to avoid vacuity the air enters into, and fills up the holes and cavernosities of the earth: for if the air could pierce the thick earth, there would never be earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes;
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:57373:117"/>
and if that air which is mixt with the substances of the earth, were sufficient for respiration, Moles needed not take so much pains as to work through and make cavities purposely for respiration. For shut up a Mole within a parcell of earth which he cannot dig through, he will die for want of suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent air. <hi>Object.</hi> 3. Exhalations and vapours arise out of the water, which shews there is air. <hi>Answ.</hi> These exhalations are the thinner parts of the water turned into vapours by heat or motion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whence it will not follow, that air is in the water actually, or a body separated from the water, in which are not cavities, as in the earth, and much lesse will it follow, that fishes breath in the water, though there were air in it, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they want the organs of breathing, as is said. <hi>Object.</hi> 4. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes inclosed in a vessel halfe full of water, strive to get up into the air. <hi>Answ.</hi> This striving to get uppermost, is not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the air, which is not their element, but to get out of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and to have more scope, being straitned in a narrow vessel: so fishes in the net struggle to get out, and to be at liberty. <hi>Object.</hi> 5. Fish in a close vessell die for want of air. <hi>Answ.</hi> They die for want of sweet water, which being included from fresh air, degenerates and putrifies. Hence fish die in a pond that is long frozen; because the water for want of agitation and fresh air, becomes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>h together under the Ice, without any air. <hi>Scaliger</hi> shewes that he hath kept fish in a close vessel, who have lived, and the same in an open vessell who have died. It is also ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest, that Leaches in a close glasse will live whole years with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out air. <hi>Object.</hi> 6. <hi>Pliny</hi> objects against <hi>Aristotle,</hi> that as some creatures have not blood, but an humor; so some fishes want lungs, but have some other instrument by which they breath. <hi>Answ.</hi> It is as easie for us to deny, as for him to affirm that which he could never prove: For neither doth he shew what these fishes be, nor what are these instruments, nor (though there were such) can he prove that they breath by them. And though some creatures have an humor in stead of blood, yet that humor hath not the properties, qualities, nor office of the blood. <hi>Object.</hi> 7. Fishes gape, therefore they breath. <hi>Answ.</hi> Here is no sequell; for Oysters gape, which breath not, and many creatures breath which gape not. Again, if with their gaping there were any breathing, we should see (saith <hi>Aristotle</hi>) the breathing parts move; but there is no motion at all, and it is impossible there should be attraction and emission of the air without motion. Besides, if Fishes breathed, we should see
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:57373:118"/>
some bubbles on the water when their breath went out, as in breathing animals when they die in the water. It is true that lunged fishes, such as Dolphins, Whales, Seals, and Frogges, make bubbles, because they breath, which will not prove that all fishes do so. And yet there be other causes of bubbling be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides expiration: for rains, tempests, vapours, or any agitation of the water will cause bubbling. <hi>Object.</hi> 8. The Moon gives increment to shell-fishes, therefore their spirits also do increase. <hi>Answ.</hi> It's true, if they speak of the animall and vitall spirits; but what is this to breathing, the subject whereof is the air, and not those innate spirits: and if increment of substance doth suppose respiration, then trees must breath as they grow in bignesse. And although the Moon causeth humid bodies to swell, yet she doth not make the air by which we breath, being a part of the Universe. <hi>Object.</hi> 9. Fishes doe smell and hear, therefore they breath, because air is the matter of all three. <hi>Answ.</hi> Air indeed may be called the matter of breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but not of hearing and smelling; it is not the air we smell or hear, but we smell the odors, and hear the sounds in the air, which is therefore properly called by Philosophers, the <hi>Medium,</hi> not the <hi>mat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>er</hi> of hearing and smelling. And as the air is to us, so the water is to fishes the <hi>medium</hi> of hearing and smelling: And if it be the matter of breathing to fishes, then it is not air but water which they breath; whereas indeed wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cannot be the subject or matter of breathing, nor can they breath at all which want the organs of breath. <hi>Object.</hi> 10. No animall can live without respiration, therefore fishes breath. <hi>Answ.</hi> The antecedent is denied; for many animals live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out respiration, onely by transpiration, such are insects, so doth the child in the matrix, so do women in their histericall passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, these breath not, yet they live. <hi>Object.</hi> 11. <hi>Pliny</hi> tells us that fishes do sleep, therefore they breath. <hi>Answ.</hi> Breathing hath no relation to sleep, it is neither the effect, nor cause, nor quality, nor part, nor property, nor consequent of sleep: for some animals sleep, which breath not all that time, as Dormice in Winter, the child in the mothers womb breathes not, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in the matrix or membran within which he lieth, no air at all, but a watrish humor, which if he should suck in by the lungs, he would be presently suffocated; yet at that time the chid sleepeth. There is no community at all in the subject or organ of sleep and respiration, nor in their natures, the one being a rest or cessation, the other a motion; the one consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the senses within the head, the other in the lungs, breast,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:57373:118"/>
and Diaphragma. Again, respiration consists rather in the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of life and sense, which accompany waking, then in sleep, which resembles death. Respiration is for refrigeration of the heart, which is more heated by the motions of the body whilst we are awake, then by rest when we are asleep; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men that walk, labour, run, struggle, or whose heart is heated by anger, or Feavers, breath much faster then in sleep, as standing more in need of air for refrigeration. So children be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of their heat breath faster then old men. Therefore we conclude<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>with <hi>Aristotle,</hi> that fishes which want lungs &amp; throats, &amp; have gills, breath not; for what needed lungs to draw in air, seeing Nature hath given them gills to let in water for cooling the fishes hear, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is but weak, because they have little blood.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <hi>II.</hi> That some small fishes have been found on hills farre from the Sea, is verified by divers; as also that sometimes fishes are digged out of the earth, which we may call <hi>Fossil,</hi> to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish them from aquatile, is recorded by grave and ancient Writers: But I believe that these are not true fishes, but rather terrestriall creatures resembling fishes in their outward shape; for as many fishes resemble terrestriall animals, which are not therefore properly terrestriall, so many terrestriall creatures may resemble fishes, which properly are not such; or else where these Fossil fishes are found, there are subterraneall waters not farre off, by which they are conveyed thither. Hence some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times fishes have been found in deep wells; and I have read of some fishes found in springs of sulphury and allum water: for otherwise fishes can no more live in the earth, then earthy creatures in the water, seeing nothing can live out of its own element, where it hath its originall food and conservation. Or lastly, these land fishes have been such as have fallen out of the clouds: For I have read in good Authors of divers showers or rains of fishes, and of Frogs and Mice, and such like animals, out of the clouds.</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <hi>III.</hi> That Fishes in Moon-shine nights, chiefly when she is in the full, delight to play upon the superficies of the water, is plain by fishermen, who take greatest quantities of them then. The cause of this may be the delight that fishes take in the light, or else they finde some moderate heat in the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies of the water when the Moon is full: but I rather think it is the pleasure they take in the Moon light, which gives a silver brightnesse to the water, and Nat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>re hath given them a quick sight and eminent eyes, whereas the senses of smelling and hearing are in them, yet the organs are so obscure they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:57373:119"/>
be found; and albeit they have all the senses, yet they are dumb, for they make no sound at all, because they breath not, nor have they the organs of sounding, such as the throat, windpipe and lungs.</p>
                     <p n="4">
                        <hi>IV.</hi> That some fishes resemble men in their faces, hands, and other parts, is no fable, for such are not only recorded by the ancients, but also have been seen by late Navigators, <hi>Lerius</hi> saw none of them, yet relates that an <hi>American</hi> fisherman cut off the hand from one of those fishes which did offer to get into his boat, the hand had five distinct fingers like ours, and in his face he resembled a man. <hi>Scaliger</hi> writes that one of those sea-men, or men-fishes was seen by <hi>Hierom</hi> Lord of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                           </gap>ides,</hi> and <hi>Sirenes,</hi> one of those <hi>Scaliger</hi> saw at <hi>Parma,</hi> about the bignesse of a childe of two years old. In some part of <hi>Scythia Pliny</hi> shewes that men did feed upon these fishes, which some condemned for Cani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals, but injuriously; for it is not the outward shape, but the soul which makes the man; neither doth the soul or essence of man admit degrees, which it must needs do, if those <hi>Tritons</hi> were imperfect men; neither is it unlikely what is written of the River <hi>Colhan</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Cohin</hi> among the <hi>Indians.</hi> That there are some human shaped fishes there called <hi>Cippe,</hi> which feed upon other fishes, these hide themselves in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by day, but in the night time they come out upon the banks, and by striking one flint against another, make such a light, that the fishes in the water being delighted with the sparkles, flock to the bank, so that the <hi>Cippae</hi> fall upon them and devour them. This I say is not improbable, if we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve how many cunning ways nature hath given to the fox, and other creatures to attain their prey. <hi>Scaliger</hi> wonders why these <hi>Cippae</hi> do not rather catch their prey in the water, then to take so much pains on the bank; but the reason may be, that either these <hi>Cippae</hi> are not so nimble and swift as those other fishes, or else that these fishes will not come near them, being afraid of their human shape, which is formidable to all creatures.</p>
                     <p n="5">
                        <hi>V.</hi> That Fishes are not dull and stupid creatures, as <hi>Cardan</hi> and some others do think, is manifest by their sagacitie and cumming they have, both to finde out their prey, and to defend themselves from their enemies. The fish called Uranioscopus, deceives the other fishes by a membran which he thrusts our of

birds fighting against one another: And that privat men have been forewarned of their death by ravens, I have not only heard and read, but have likewise observed divers times: a late example I have of a young gentleman, Mr. <hi>Draper</hi> my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate friend, who about five or six years ago, being then in the flower of his age, had on a sudden one or two ravens in his chamber, which had been quarrelling upon the top of the chimney; these he apprehended as messengers of his death, and so they were; for he died shortly after. There is then no superstition in the observation of such things; for God is pleased sometimes to give men warning of their ends by such means; so we finde in the life of <hi>Cicero,</hi> who was forewarned by the noise and fluttering of the ravens about him, that his end was near; which proved true, for the murtherers sent by <hi>Mark Antonie</hi> slew him presently after in his Sedan: Why may not God forewarn men of their future death and calamities by birds, as well as by generation of monsters, apparition of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets, strange showres of frogs, blood, stones, and such like; I saw a little before these last troubles of <hi>Germany,</hi> divers <hi>Parse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leons,</hi> or <hi>Moors</hi> with crosses in the air, not long before the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing of the last blazing star. Why is it less superstitious to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve such uncouth meteors, then uncouth actions of birds and beasts, or why is there less credit to be given to the one then the other, seeing God can make use of all his creatures as he pleaseth: therefore he that imployed a raven to be a feeder of <hi>Elias,</hi> may employ the same bird as a messenger of death to others. <hi>Camerarius</hi> out of <hi>Dietmarus</hi> and <hi>Erasinus Stella,</hi> Writes of a certain fountain near the river <hi>Albis</hi> or <hi>Elbe</hi> in <hi>Germany</hi> which presageth Wars by turning red and bloudy coloured.

There is a noble Family in <hi>Bohemia</hi> vvhich is forevvarned of death, by a spectrum or ghost appearing like a Woman cloathed in mourning.

I observe that it hath continued thundring and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning almost 14 hours with some short interruptions; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as usually thunder lasteth not above an houre or two: By which I fear me God is forwarning this Land of the horrible bloodshed and calamities which are suddenly like to fall out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, which we beseech God in his mercy to avert, and to give us all repenting and relenting hearts.</p>

                        <hi>IV.</hi> That sneezing or sternutation was superstitiously abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the Centiles in divination, is manifest by their writings, who used to fore-tell good or bad events by sneezing: they held that propitious which was in the afternoon, and towards the right hand; but to sneeze in the morning, or towards the
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:57373:123"/>
left hand, was counted unlucky, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> sheweth. So su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious they were, that if they sneezed whilst they were ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing in the morning, they would to bed again; and if any snee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed at Table whilst the meat was taking away, they would set down the meat again. If the Generall of an Army did sneeze when he was going to fight, he would forbeare fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that day, such an ominous thing they held sneezing to be. On the other side, at <hi>Monopotama</hi> sternutation was of such high esteem, that when the King sneezed, all the people would fall down and worship him; and proclamations were sent abroad to give notice to all the Kings subjects of his sneezing, to the end they might rejoyce and worship. Among the rest of the Gentiles ridiculous opinions, this was one, That <hi>Prometheus</hi> was the first that wisht wel to the sneezer, when the man which he had made of clay, sell into a fit of Sternutation upon the approach of that celestiall fire which he stole from the Sun. This gave originall to that custome among the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles in saluting the sneezer. They used also to worship the head in sternutation, as being a divine part, and seat of the senses, and cogitation. They held also sternutation one of their gods: &amp; because their chiefest soothsayings and divination was by Birds, hence sternutation was called <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> a Bird by them: &amp; by reason it is the action of the brain which is the seat of the senses, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in <hi>Aristophanes</hi> the word sneezing is used for feeling; as when he saith, <hi>I sneezed not the blow,</hi> his Interpreter expounds it, <hi>I felt it not,</hi> as <hi>Caelius</hi> observeth. But now because the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles abused sneezing superstitiously, and wished well to the Sneezer, we must not hence inferre, That to pray for the safety of him who sneezeth, is superstition or Gentilisme, as some do: for so we may conclude by the same reason, that to pray at all is superstition, because the Gentiles used to pray. It is an anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent custome among Christians to wish well to him that snee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth, taking its originall from the time of St. <hi>Gregory,</hi> when at <hi>Rome</hi> in a great sicknesse, men died with sneezing. Doctor <hi>Brown</hi> out of <hi>Fernandes</hi> brings some proofes to shew, that the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal of wishing wel to the sneezer, is more ancient then <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi>; to whom I answer, That it was used among the Gentiles before <hi>Gregories</hi> time; but I deny that it was usuall among Christians till then. From this sicknesse therefore at <hi>Rome</hi> in <hi>Gregories</hi> dayes, in which this wel-wishing was used, and not from the Gentiles practice, we draw this civill and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable custome in praying for our friend or neighbour when he sneezeth.</p>

                        <hi>V.</hi> In those that are thunder-struck, divers things are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, as, 1. They keep the same posture of body being dead, which they had when they were alive at the time when they were struck, as <hi>Cardan</hi> (<hi>de rer. var. lib.</hi> 8, <hi>c.</hi> 44.) instanceth of 8 harvest people in the Isle <hi>Lemnes,</hi> who sitting together under an Oak at supper, were all thunder-struck, retaining the same posture they had before; one with his hand on the cup ready to drink, the other with the cup at his mouth; a third with meat in his mouth; so that they looked like so many statues. The reason of this may be the stifnesse of the nerves and muscles, being parched and dried up by the hot and sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phury matter of the lightning. The like I read of those that are killed with excessive cold, which so stiffeneth those parts mentioned, that the body retains its posture whether sitting or standing. 2. They that are thunder-struck look black, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the heat drieth up the radicall moisture. The like we see of fire, which makes the whitest paper and linnen grow black, and the Sun tans mens skins. 3. Their bodies do not putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, by reason their moisture, which is the mother of putrifacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is exhausted. 4. There is neither wild beasts nor rave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous birds will touch or come neere such bodies, because of their sulphury smell which is noisome to them, and their dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is such, that they can afford no nutriment. 5. That part which is wounded by the thunder, is colder then any other, notwithstanding that the lightning or thunder is of a fiery na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; because all things which have been heated by the fire, grow colder then before, by reason the inward heat is drawn out by the fire; for in things of the same nature or quality, the stronger attracts the weaker. 6. The <hi>Romans</hi> never suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their bodies to be burned that were thunder-struck, but covered them with earth in the same place where they were struck, or let them remain unburied, nor would they suffer any funeral obsequies to be performed to them: perhaps they thought it unfitting to burn those with terrestriall fire, who had been scorched already with fire from heaven, or to take the shape away, or figure of that body with their fire which the celestiall fire had spared: nor would they honour him with a a funerall whom they thought execreable, and extreamly ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the gods: therefore none would venture to come neer the place, till it was expiared by a sacrifice, which was called <hi>Bidenta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

2.) because none durst touch or come neer him. 7. The thunder seldome or never kills those that are asleep, but such onely as are awaked: this may proceed from the fear which is in those that are awaked, by which the spirits &amp; blood sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly suffocate the heart, whereas in sleep there is no fear or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension of danger; and not only men, but cattell also are much afrighted: wherefore in thundring times the shepheards use to gather their sheep together, that being united, they may be the lesle fearfull, whereas any creature alone is subject to be fearfull. 8. It is a strange quality in the thunder to break the bones, to melt the sword, to dry up the wine, to kill the infant in the womb, and yet not touch the skin, the scabbard, the barrell, nor the mother; perhaps the skin and leather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pory, transmits the sulphury vapour, which is resisted by the bones and metall. As for the wine exhausted, I think <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, Plutarch,</hi> and others, mean onely the Spirits of the wine evaporated; and so the child being more tender and apter to receive the malignant vapour of the thunder then the mother might die and she live.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>WE have proved already (<hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 4. <hi>sect.</hi> 3.) that the female hath no active active seed for generation, but is meerly passive, affording onely blood, and the place of conception, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the truth of <hi>Aristotles</hi> doctrine; but because the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians are of another opinion, that the female hath also seed actively concurring to generation, we will examine the solidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their reasons. 1. Doctor <hi>Harvy</hi> (<hi>Exercit.</hi> 32.) proveth, That in the female there is an active principle of generation, <hi>Because of the Horse and Asse is procreated a mixt species, to wit, the Mule, the whole form whereof is made up and mixed of both pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; so that the Horse alone was not sufficient to produce this form of the Mule in the matter, but as the whole form is mixed, therefore the Asse must concurre as an other efficient cause. Answ.</hi> The Mule is not a compounded species, or mixed of the Horse and Asse,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:57373:124"/>
but rather a third species different from both, as having nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in whole nor in part, nor separated, nor mixed, their essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall forms, but hath its own specificall form, and properties distinct from those of the parents, as we may see in the Mules sterrility, which is a property not individuall as in some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther animals; but specificall, of which the species of the Horse and Asse is not capable. As for some outward resemblances in the Mule to the parents, these are but accidentall, and are in animals of farre different species, as also in trees, and other vegetables. Besides, the forms or species of things cannot be mixed, because essences are impartible, and admit no intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons nor remissions: the form then being simple and indivisible, cannot be made up of two, so that two seeds cannot concurre as two efficient causes to make up a third entity. For, <hi>Ex 'duobus entibus per se, non fit unum ens per se.</hi> Again, wee see that trees and plants are generated of one seed without co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation; for the earth concurres, not by affording another seed to propagate, but as the matrix to cherish and foment. So in fishes, which have no distinct sex, there is generation, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, because in them there is seed, which is the onely active principle of generation. Again, that outward shape or form which the Mule hath, was not induced by the formative faculty of the females seed; for there is none, as we have shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, much lesse of the blood, for the plastick vertue resideth not in the blood, but in the Males seed; which of its own particular nature endeavours to form a Horse, but finding the Asses blood (being united now and coagulated with and by the Horses seed, uncapable to receive that form of the Horse, is retreated by the superior and generall formative faculty, which aiming at the production of a new species for the perfection of the Universe, generates a Mule. Hence we may inferre, that Mules were not the invention of <hi>Ana,</hi> except we will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the world was imperfect till that time, which were an injury to God who made the world perfect; but perfect it could not be till the production of this species: for <hi>Perfectum est cui nihil deest.</hi> The Doctors second Argument, (<hi>Exercit.</hi> 34) is taken from the production of the egge, which <hi>Aristotle</hi> holds is generated by the Hen, and which hath also vegitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from her. Hence he inferres, <hi>That according to Aristotles mind, the Hen is an active principle in generation. Answ.</hi> From hence it will not follow, That the Hen is an active principle in the generation of the Chick, because she furnisheth the Egge, which is the materials of the chick; for so in other animals the
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:57373:125"/>
female furnisheth blood, which is the matter of which the Embryo is made; and yet she is not, as we have said, an effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cause of generation, but the male onely by his seed; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will it follow, that vegitation doth still presuppose gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; for in many individuals there is a vegitive, soul, and yet no generation, so there is in some species, as in Mules, in <hi>adianthum</hi> or <hi>capillus veneris,</hi> which we call <hi>Maiden-hair,</hi> and divers other hearhs which generate not, though they have vegitation. But when <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith, The egge is generated in the Hen, or that the female generates in her self, he takes ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration in a large sense, for any way of production; so we say water is generated of air, and worms of purrid matter, and yet neither the one nor the other is the efficient, but the materiall cause onely of generation. And though we should yeeld that the Hen were the efficient cause of the egge, yet it will not therefore follow, that she is the efficient cause of the Chick, for that is onely the Cock, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> holds: though in the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man there is a working faculty of her blood, yet there is no working faculty in her of the child or Embryo; that is meerly from the plastick power of the fathers seed.</p>

Answ.</hi> 1. We deny that there is seed in the woman properly so called. 2. If it were so that she had seed, yet it will not follow that it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lificall; for it must be concocted &amp; spirituous, because the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are the prime instruments of Nature in generation: but the the womans seed is crude, because that Sex by nature is cold, being compared to the man, as both <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi> affirm, and experience doth evince; for the woman is much weaker and slower then the man, whereas strength and agility ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues plenty of spirits and calidity: The mans hairs also are more curled, stiffe and strong then the womans, which shews more heat. The womans voyce is weaker and smaller, which argues the narrownesse of the vessels, and consequently defect of heat, and because the woman is lesse hot and dry then the man. Hence it is that she abounds much more in blood, which in man is dried up. Besides, the woman is the more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Sex, her seed therefore must be imperfect, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently not fit to be the principall or efficient cause of so noble an animall as man. <hi>Aristotle</hi> observeth, that boyes in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers womb are more lively, and nimbler then maids, that they
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:57373:125"/>
are sooner formed in the matrix, and that the woman sooner groweth to her height, and sooner decayeth, her strength quickly fails her, and old age assaults her soonest. Secondly, he proves, <hi>That the child drawes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Hence many times gowry fathers beget gowty children. His third Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is, <hi>The child oftentimes resembleth the mother, therefore her seed must needs be active. Answ.</hi> That the child for the most resembleth the mother, proceedeth not from any agencie of her seed, but from the strength of her imagination; for otherwise the child would still resemble the father, in whose seed alone resideth the formative faculty, which because it is a naturall power depending from the generative, and consequently infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to the imagination, which is an animall faculty that giveth place to this. This force of the mothers imagination is plain by the divers impressions made on the tender Embryo upon her depraved imaginations, by the stories of those women who have conceived children resembling the pictures hanging in their bed-chambers, and by the practise of <hi>Iacob, Gen.</hi> 30. in causing his Ewes to bring forth streaked Lambs, according to the streaked rods put in their troughes when they drank.</p>

And though in a dead Hen those passages or conveyances cannot appear, yet in the living Hen they are open for the seminall va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour to passe. For this cause in the closure of the Cocks trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, there is a nimble and almost imperceptible touch of both their fundaments, by which then the seminall spirit is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed. Again, the Doctor faith (<hi>Exersit.</hi> 25.) <hi>That whereas the soule is the act of an organicall body, having life potentially, it is in credible that it should be in a Chick before any part <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> of its body be-organized.
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:57373:127"/>
Answ.</hi> The egge is not altogether a body inorgani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call actually, seeing it hath different parts. Besides, it is orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall potentially, as containing in it all the parts and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers the Chick that shall bee. So the seed of other animals contains potentially the animall that shall be, with all its members; therefore the common opinion is, that seed is drawn from all parts of the body, because it contains in it all the parts. As the soul then is in that body which hath life potenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, that is, a possibility to exercise the functions of life; so it is in the body that hath organs potentially, or the faculty of producing organs. Hence the soule cannot be in a stone, which hath not this possibility. Of this opinion is the Doctor (<hi>Exer.</hi> 71) when he saith, <hi>That in the primogeniall humidity of the egge, all the parts of the chick are potentially, but none actually.</hi> Again, he saith, <hi>Exer.</hi> 25.) <hi>That in the egge and chick there cannot be the same soule, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are different entities, &amp; produce different, yea contrary operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, so that the one may seem to be begot of the others corruption. Ans.</hi> I deny that the egg &amp; chick are different entities otherwise then <hi>secundum magis &amp; minus,</hi> as an imperfect thing differs from it selfe, when it becomes more perfect; in this respect an infant and a man may be called different entities, and they have their different operations; yet they have the same soule. If then we conclude diversities of things from diversities of operations, we must inferre that every animall is different from it self, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it produceth different operations, and that <hi>Peter</hi> hath not the same soule when he doth different things. How many different entities must there be in the Sunne, who produceth so many different effects. Neither do I allow of the Doctors Assertion, in saying, <hi>The chick is begot of the egges corruption</hi>; for indeed it is begot of the egges perfection: For then is the egge perfected when the chick is procreated. If by corruption he understand the abolition of the form of the egge, I assent to him, that according to the old Peripatetick Maxime, <hi>The corruption of one thing is the generation of another.</hi> But if by corruption he understand putrifaction, as he seems to doe, I say that then a chick is not, nor cannot be procreated of a putrified egge, which is fitter to breed worms then a Chick.</p>
                     <p n="4">
                        <hi>IV.</hi> Because the soule is a pure and celestiall substance, and our bodies are grosse and earthy, on which so sublimate an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity cannot operate without a <hi>medium,</hi> that may in some sort participate of both natures, therefore God in his wisdom hath interposed the animall and vital spirits as the immediate instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:57373:127"/>
of the soul to work upon the body. But Dr. <hi>Harvy</hi> (<hi>Exercit.</hi> 70) <hi>will have the blood to be this immediat instrument of the soul, because it is every where present, and runs to and fro with great celerity. Answ.</hi> Neither can the blood be the immediat instrument of the soul, because the spirits being of a purer es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, come nearer to the nature of the soule, and therefore must be more immediat; neither is there any ubiquitary pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence or celerity of motion in the blood, but by the reason of the spirits which drive it to and fro. Besides, all animals have not blood, some being exanguious, yet they have spirits by which they are moved. Again, he saith, <hi>That the blood works a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the power of the elements, being the part first begot, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate heat doth fabricate the other parts of the body. Answ.</hi> The blood works not at all, much lesse above the elementary pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, but by vertue of the spirits; which the Doctor immediatly after seems to acknowledg, when he faith, <hi>It is made the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate instrument of life, by the gift of the formative faculty and vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive soule.</hi> Now this formative faculty consisteth immediatly in the spirits, and so doth the vegitive soule, which are even in those parts where there is no blood at all, to wit, in the spermaticall parts, according to the doctrine of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen.</hi> To say then that the blood is the immediat instrument of life, by means of the plastick faculty, is in effect to say, It is not the immediat, because there is one more immediat, to vvit, the plastick faculty in the spirits. Neither is the blood the part first begot, as the Doctor saith, if we will believe the <hi>Galenists,</hi> but the spermatick parts are first begot, if we speak of the formation of the child: neither can the blood fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricate any part at all, being a dull thing in it selfe: but the spirits, or the plastick faculty in them doe fabricate, the blood is onely the materiall cause of the flesh and sanguineall parts, as the <hi>Galenists</hi> affirm. And whereas the Doctor saith, That <hi>the blood is a spirit,</hi> because <hi>Virgil</hi> saith,

He speaks very improperly, for blood and a spirit are specifical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly different, and if the Poet had meant that blood and a spirit were the same thing, he had used a meer tautologie, which is far from his elegancie; and therefore his words intimate the contrary, that they are different things, because he saith, <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guisque animusque,</hi> though then they had but one passage or vent, yet they are not one thing. And whereas he saith, That <hi>the blood is celestiall, because the soule lodgeth in it,</hi> he may say the whole body is celestiall, being the house and tabernacle of the
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:57373:128"/>
soule, which lodgeth in each part thereof, even where there is no blood, as in the bones, grisles, &amp;c. But indeed the spirits are rather to be called celestiall, because in them the soul immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly resides, and by them in the blood, and other parts. The blood then is not celestial at all, but by the spirits, nor these in respect of their originall, but because of thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> celestial qualities and operations. Again, when he distinguisheth the principall agent from the instrumentall in this, <hi>That the one can never work above its own strength, whereas the other doth.</hi> I say, this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction is needlesse; for no agent can work above its own strength, much lesse the instrumentall, which worketh not at all, but as it is moved by the principall agent: The instrument then doth not worke above its own strength, but the prime agent worketh by it, above the strength of the instrument. Besides, when hee saith, <hi>That the blood de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves the name of Spirit, because it abounds more with radicall moisture then other parts, by which it feeds all other parts.</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, That the seed deserves rather to be called a Spirit; for though in the blood there is more moisture extensively, yet in the seed there is more radicall moisture<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>: And if that which feeds us immediatly be a spirit, then the blood is no spirit; for it is not that, but a roscid and benigne juice ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted from thence, which immediatly nourisheth us. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when he saith, <hi>That the soule with the blood performes all things in us</hi>; If he understand here (as he seemes to doe in all his discourse) collaterall efficient causes, I deny his saying; for the soule by the spirits is the sole efficient cause of all that is acted within us, the blood is onely a mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall cause, having no more efficiency in it, then Bricks and Mortar have towards the building of an house. Doctor <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy</hi> (<hi>de Conciptione</hi>) <hi>will have the Female conceive and be prolifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call without any sensible corporeall Agent, as Iron touched with the Loadstone draweth other Iron to it.</hi> Again hee saith, <hi>That the substance of the womb being ready for conception, is very like the constitution of the brain.</hi> Why then should not their function be alike? And what the phantasme or appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite is in the brain, the very same, or its analogy is excited after copulation in the womb; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>for the functions of both are called conceptions. And shortly after, <hi>As when we have conceived a form or Idaea in the brain, wee produce the like in our workmanship; even so the Idea or species of the Father be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing existant in the womb by the help of the formative faculty, produceth the lik brood.</hi> Then after divers amplifications to the
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:57373:128"/>
same purpose, he concludes, <hi>That it is no absurdity if the female that is made pregnant by conceiving the generall Idaea without matter, doth generate. Answ.</hi> In this Tract the Doctor seemes some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to be in earnest, and sometimes to speak-problematical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or rather doubtfully: But however, this opinion cannot consist with reason; for what can be more unreasonable, then that the Noblest Animals should be conceived without any sensible corporeall Agent, by meere imagination, not of the brain, but of the Womb: For, 1. If this be true, that the Female can thus conceive and generate, what need was there of the Male? they are then uselesse in generation, and fathers have no reason to provide for their wives children, seeing the woman is the sole parent, the man but a Cypher. Why should there be any lawes against adultery and fornication, seeing there can be no such sins? If this doctrine be true, what miracle was it for a virgin to conceive and bear a Son without the help of man, seeing this is ordinary for the female, as the Doctor faith, to be prolificall without any sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible corporeall agents; for the seed, he saith, is not received within the matrix. But if I should grant him this (which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be true) yet he cannot deny but that the seminal vapour and prolificall spirit is conveyed thither, by which the female is made pregnant; if he grants this, then there is a sensible corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reall agent, though not so grosse as the earthy part of the seed: If he deny this, then it will follow, that we are all produced without fathers and that there is no other sensible corporeall agent but the womb; and so the fifth Commandement of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noring father should be put out, seeing there is no such thing in nature. Again, if he saith there is no agent, then it will follow, that the effect can be produced without an efficient, and an action without an actor. If he he saith there is an agent, but not corporeall, then that agent must be either a spirit or an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; if a spirit, then we are all the children of spirits, not of corporeall parents, and so man cannot have for his genus a corporeall substance. And these spirits, if created, must be either Angels, Demons, or Souls, which was the dreams of some ancient Hereticks, long since condemned by Councels. If again he saith, that these agents are not spirits, but acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, he will make us in a worse condition: For man, the Noblest of all creatures, is the child of an accident, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Aristotle</hi> should have placed man in the Categorie of quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty rather then of substance. But we know that no accident is operativ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> but in and by the power of the principall agent;
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:57373:129"/>
Neither can an accident be conveyed into the womb without the subject in which it is inherent: and therefore Iron touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without the Loadstone, cannot draw Iron if the substance of the Loadstone were not imparted to it. Hence we see, that as the substance of the Loadstone in the Iron decayes, so the vertue of attraction decayes likewise. Again, when he saith, that the substance of the womb is like the constitution of the brain, he speaks very improperly; for neither is the substance of the one like the substance of the other; the one being white, spermatical and cold; the other red, sanguineal and hot; nor can the substance of the one be like the constitution of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, these being indifferent predicaments, between which there is no similitude, nor is the constitution of the one like unto the constitution of the other, as being of different temperaments, and having different uses; and suppose they were either of the same substance, or constitution, it will not follow, that therefore they must have the same function: The stomach and guts have the same substance and constitution, so hath the brain and pith in the back bone: yet they have not the same functions. Again, when he saith, [that what the fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasm or appetite is in the brain, the same or its analogy is excited in the womb, for the functions of both are called conceptions.] He speaks more improperly then before; for he seems to make the fantasm and appetite one thing, and to be both resident in the brain, whereas the appetite is the inclination of the will, and hath its residence in the heart; the fantasm is the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or fictitious object of the fantasie, which this internal sense residing in the brains represents to it self; neither of these is excited in the womb, nor any thing like it; for the womb is neither the seat of the fantasie, nor hath it fit organs for it; nor is it the seat of appetite, except by this word he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands an inclination to conception or generation: neither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain is this a valid reason, that because the functions of the womb and brain are called conceptions, therefore they are the same; for the conception of the womb is far different from that of the brain, neither do they agree, but equivocally, and in name onely; so this word conception is ascribed to the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of understanding. Lastly, though we can produce upon stone, or timber, or such like matter, some shape or form like that Idea in our brain, yet it will not follow that the species of the father in the womb can produce the like brood; for I deny that the species or idea of the father is in the womb, but in the brain; this (not that) being the proper fea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> of the fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasie,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:57373:129"/>
which receiveth the species from the common sense, and the imagination doth not alwayes work upon the seed, or em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bryo, nor doeth it produce any form, it onely worketh some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times and produceth but the accidental form; whereas ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily both the essential and accidental forms are produced by the formative power of the seed, or rather by the soul it self, which fabricates its own mansion, which soul lay potentially in the seed, and is excited by the heat, or rather innate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the matrix. To conclude, it is as great absurdity to affirm that the female can be made pregnant, by conceiving a general immateral idea, as it was by some of the ancients to think, that the Spanish Mares could, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> speaks, <gap reason="foreign">

Chapter.

Answ.</hi> These reas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ns are of small validity. For 1. it was not the eating of mans flesh at the siege of <hi>Naples</hi> that brought this disease into <hi>Europe,</hi> but it was procured by some of <hi>Columbus</hi> his Company, who had carnal commerce with soul Indian women, which with the pox they brought along with them. 2. Mans flesh of all other animals is counted the most temperate, therefore cannot produce such a venomous distemper so repugnant to mans bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. 3. This is a peculiar disease of the Indians, both East and West; for divers Countries have their divers maladies. 4. Neither can this, or any disease be counted new in respect of their subjects, original causes, or seminaries, for this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease is as old as mans flesh, though in this part of the world it did not break out so generally as of late; and who knows but that the ancients had it, but under another name, being a kind of Leprosie. 5. The Canibals among the Indians are not more subject to this disease then others, who never tasted of mans flesh; for in all ages there have been men eaters, yet not tainted mith this malady, and millions of latter years a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, who are infected with this poyson, and yet never eat of mans flesh. 6. It is against reason to imagine, that the flesh of a man should rather breed this disease, then of an ox or a sheep, seeing mans flesh is sooner convertible into nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then of any other animal, because of the greater simpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and specifical unity. 7. Though ignorant Indians do mix mans blood or fat with poyson, it will not therefore follow, that these are poy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="237" facs="tcp:57373:130"/>
fools, may eat mans flesh, hoping thereby to aid their imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, but there is no such vetue in mans flesh as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive; so they use many spels, charms, and canting words, in which there is no more vertue then in a pibble stone, or a piece of rotten wood. 9. Mans flesh can afford no soul vapors, except it befoul it self, and putrified, and so indeed it may breed loathsome diseases, as all other corrupt and putrified meats do; which is done as it is corrupted, not as it is mans flesh; neither can it afford high vapors, except it were full of spirits, which cannot be in a piece of dead flesh; he that will have high vapors must drink sack, not eat mans flesh; the blood of the vine, not of the vein can breed high vapors.

He affirms dilatation to be the cause of this expulsion, therefore his exception against the former o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion was needless; and whereas he grants the flame to be the immediate expeller of the pellet, he unawares affirms what he rejects: neither can I see any difference between the flame of the nitre, and the spirit of the nitre inflamed, onely he was pleased to make shew of a new reason, by altering some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what the words of the former, whereas the sense is one and the same, the speculation then is not crude, but the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of his nitre is crude, which without the flame can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>

Nitre which is mentioned by the Ancients, is hot and not cold; and therefore both <hi>Dioscorides, Pliny,</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi> adscribe to it the qualities of heat, to cut, extennat, discuss and purge gross and cold humors; and if that nitre which we use at this day, be not the same, yet it is not much unlike, (as <hi>Mathiolus</hi> shews) as having divers qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of the old nitre; besides, it is a kinde of salt, and is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got of hot things, as pigeons dung, and the urins of animals, therefore <hi>Brun.

I deny that snow is colder then water, because it hath more spirit; but because it is more condensed: for heat and cold are more active in a dense and solid, then in a thin atternated substance; so ice is colder then water, and yet who will say that there is more spirits in the ice then in water; besides, the snow is colder then the water, because begot of colder winds, and in colder clymats. 5. I deny that insects are cold to the touch, for having in them the spirit of life; because they are colder when that spirit is gon, as we see in all dead bodies which are colder, then when they were alive; therefore death is called by the Poets (<hi>frigida more</hi>) and (<hi>gelidum frigus</hi>) the spirit of life is that which is both begot of heat, and begets heat, and preserveth it; that when that spirit leave su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

then mens, and some men of colder constitutions then others, because they have fewer spirits, and more of earth and water in them. We know also how dull and stupid our hands are in cold frosts, till the spirits in them be quickned by heat. 6. I deny also that quicksilver is the coldest of metals, because ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest of spirits: for it is much doubted whether Mercury be cold at all; for agility proceeds from heat, not from cold, and such a quality became the messenger of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> by whom all things receive life and vigour. Indeed Mercury may be called the Monster of Nature; for sometimes it refrigerats, sometimes it califieth; it cures sometimes cold, sometimes hot diseases; take it hot, it produceth cold; take it cold, it produceth hot effects: and it hath this quality of heat, that nothing is more penetrating then it is. <hi>Christopher Encelius</hi> (<hi>de re metalica</hi>) makes it hot and moist in the fourth degree. <hi>Quercitan</hi> in his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to <hi>Aubert,</hi> makes it rather aerial then aquiall; &amp; we know that heat is one of the qualities of air. <hi>Renodaeus (in Pharmac.)</hi> makes it both hot and cold. <hi>Keckerman (in Sist.

                     <p>In his following discourses he hath phrases not to be tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Phylosophy, as when he saith (<hi>Cent.</hi> 1.80.)

That <hi>paper or wood oyled, last long moist, but wet with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter dry or putrifie sooner, the cause is, for that air medleth little with the moisture of oyle.

<pb n="241" facs="tcp:57373:132"/>
with water? The reason is, because oyle is a more tenacious and dense substance then water, and therefore resisteth the heat of the air longer, and cannot be so soon evaporated; and indeed it is not the air, but the heat in the air that works both on water and oile; for the cold air drieth up neither, it may well harden them. Take then two papers, the one moystned with water, the other with oyle, and hold them near the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>re, we shall see the one dried up long before the other, so that his saying is erroneous when he inferreth (<hi>Sect.</hi> 91.) That <hi>fire worketh upon oyle as air upon water.</hi> For indeed the air doth not work upon water, but heat in the air or fire; nor doth the fire work so soon upon the oyle as on the water, when they are at a distance. Again, he saith, <hi>That white is a penurious colour, and where moisture is scant. Answ.</hi> There are many things which want moisture, and yet are black, as divers dry stones and coals; many bodies are not scant of moisture, and yet are white, as Lilies, Milk, Snow. There is as much moisture in a white Swan as in a black Raven. But when he saith (<hi>Sect.</hi> 93) That <hi>Birds and Horses by age turn white, and the gray hairs of men come by the same reason</hi>; he is mistaken: for it is not want or scant of moisture, but want of heat rather that is the cause of whitenesse: for old men abound more in watrish moisture then young men: and therefore we see that cold climats pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce white complexions and skins, whereas they are black and swarthy in hot Countries. Snow is not bred in hot Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, but in cold Winters; and hoar frost is ingendred in cold <hi>Scithia,</hi> not in hot <hi>Ethiopia.</hi> Again, he is mistaken when he saith, (<hi>Sect.</hi> 96, 97.) That <hi>the soals of the feet have great affinity with the head and mouth of the stomach; so the wrists and hands have a sympathy with the heart.</hi> For there is no more affinity between these parts then any other; the feet have as great a sympthy with the heart, and the wrists with the head, as these with the heart and the other with the head. If there be any affinity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the head and the feet, it is by reason of the nerves; and so the same affinity may be to the hands. If there be any sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy between the heart and the wrists, it is because of the arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and so the sympathy may be to the feet. It's true, that the heart is affected in Agues by things applied to the wrists; not because there is any sympathy between the skin, muscles, nerves and bones of the wrists with the heart; but because the arteries which have their originall from the heart, lie more open, and are more tangible there then in many other parts of the body; and yet in the temples, and divers other parts of
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:57373:133"/>
the body, you shall find the pulse as well as in the wrists, and things applied to these parts, will work as powerfully on the heart, as if applied to the wrists.</p>
                     <p>His Lordship is angry, (<hi>Sect.</hi> 98.) <hi>Because we call the spirits of Plants and living Creatures (Soules) such superficiall speculations</hi> (saith he) <hi>they have.</hi> But he should for the same reason be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with the Scriptures, which ordinarily calls the spirits of beasts, birds, and fishes (Souls.) He must also be angry with all wise Nomenclators, which have called living and sensitive creatures (Animals) because they have (animal soules:) For <hi>animal</hi> is from <hi>anima.</hi>) Again, I would know, if this word likes him not, how he will call these spirits of animals? If he call them nothing but spirits, then he makes no difference between them and all other tangible bodies: For, according to his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, there are spirits in stocks and stones, as well as in plants and animals; but I hope the spirits of these deserve a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother name, then of the others; which indeed, according to the old and true Philosophy, are meer qualities: which word also he rejects as Logicall, as though forsooth Logick, or Logicall terms were needlesse, whereas no knowledge is more usefull and necessary, as being the hand-maid to all Sciences, the want of which hath occasioned multitudes of whimzicall conceits, and Chimera's in mens brains. Again, if he will not have these chiefe acts, agents, or movers in animals, to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led souls or spirits, but air, or vapour, or wind, he will find that all these three are called by the word (<hi>Anima</hi>) 1.

                     <p>My Lord in his second <hi>Century</hi> (<hi>sect.</hi> 11.) <hi>Makes pictures and shapes but secondary objects to the eye, but colours and order the things that are pleasing to the sight.</hi> If he had said, That colours are the chief objects of the eye, he had spoken more properly then to say, they are pleasing to the eye; for some colours are very dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:57373:133"/>
to some eyes. As for order, that is not at all the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the sight; for it is a relation, and relations incurre not into the senses. Again, he saith (<hi>sect.</hi> 114.) <hi>That the sense of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring striketh the spirits more immediatly then the other senses.</hi> This is a very improper saying; for the senses are patients in receiving the species of their objects, not agents upon their objects. If there be any action of dijudication, that is the work of the phantasie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> rather then of the outward sense; and though I should yeeld that there were some actions of the eye, yet the sense of hearing is meerly passive, and therefore it is not the sense of hearing that striketh the spirits, but the species of the sound which is received by the spirit in the auditory nerve, and so conveyed into the phantasie: so it is not the smel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling (as he saith) that worketh on the spirits, but the object that worketh on the sense of smelling. Again, when he saith, (<hi>sect.</hi> 117.) <hi>That dores in fair weather give no sound</hi>; he speakes by contraries: for if by fair weather he means dry weather, then dores give the greatest sound. I know not what kind of dores his were, but mine sound much in dry Summers, and but little in moist weather. And this stands with reason; for the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity of the air must needs moisten the hinges, &amp; consequently hinder their sound. Neither is it true which he saith of bullets, (<hi>sect.</hi> 120.) <hi>That they in piercing through the air make no noyse</hi>: For Souldiers will tell him the contrary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that many times they hear the whistling of the bullets over their heads. So darts and stones flung with violence in the air, make a sound, as the Poet sheweth:

                        </q>
And his reason is no lesse infirm then his observation, to wit, That the extream violence or swiftnesse of the motion should hinder the sound, whereas nothing furthers the noyse so much as the swiftnesse of motion. Again, he is mistaken in our defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of sounds, when he makes us say, <hi>That it is an elision of the air, which is a term of ignorance.</hi> (<hi>sect.</hi> 124.)

And no lesse is he mistaken when he saith, <hi>That Sounds are generated where there is no air at all.</hi> This he can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver prove, for even in the water, and in the flame (wherein he saith sounds are generated) there is air; and if it were not for air, the sound should never be caried to our ear; and therefore the instrance he makes (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

is to no purpose; for there is air present, both in the water, and besides nothing but air from the superficies of the water to our ear, by which <hi>medium</hi> the sound is conveyed to us. He gives us a strange reason (<hi>Sect.</hi> 143.) why we hear better in the night then in the day, <hi>Because in the day the air is more thin, and the sound pierceth better, but when the air is more thick, the sound spreadeth abroad lesse.</hi> Indeed by this reason we should hear bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by day; for the thinnesse of the air, and the easie piercing of the sound, are main helps to hearing, whereas the thickness of the air is a hinderance: Therefore <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in his Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rismes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> observeth truly, That when the wind is Southerly, and the air thick, our hearing is heavy.

For in a close chamber I can heare the voyce of him that is in the next room, though there be a wall between us, and the room sieled or roofed. But he saith (<hi>Sect.</hi> 213.) That <hi>the spirit of the hard body doth cooperate.</hi> I would know what spirits there are in a stone or brick wall, or in a wall of mud to cooperate? If there be such cooperating spirits, it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That where are greatest numbers of them, there will be most help, and the sound better heard; but in a thick stone wall there are more spirits (because more stones, every stone having his own spirit) then in a thin mud, woodden, or brick wall, and therefore the sound must be better heard through a thick then a thin wall, there being so many pneumaticall co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operators, all helping to carry the sound. This is Philosophy that passeth all understanding. He saith (<hi>Sect.</hi> 235.) <hi>It is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest that between sleeping and waking (when all the senses are bound and suspended) musick is farre sweeter then when one is fully waking.</hi>
                        <pb n="245" facs="tcp:57373:134"/>
All the senses are not bound when a man is between sleeping and waking; but when a man is in dead sleep, then are all the senses bound: If then they are all bound, and likewise all are bound between sleeping and waking, what difference will he make between the extream and the medium, between a dead sleep, and that which is betwixt sleeping and waking. Again, how can musick be sweet to him in whom all the senses are bound up? Which way shall the musick enter? Can he heare without hearing? Doubtlesse the delight he hath in the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick doth shew all his senses are not bound up. He shews, (238, 239.) That <hi>Parrets, Pies, Iayes, Dawes and Ravens, are singing birds, and that this aptnesse of singing is in their attention.</hi> He should have added Thrushes and Stares to his singing birds; but it is not attention which is the cause of their singing; for beasts and other birds may have as much attention, but its natural for birds to sing, and their speaking is but a kind of singing, for singing is the musick of the throat, and speaking the musick of the tongue: it is easie for those who exercise their throats and tongues in singing, to be brought to utter words by the same or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans. <hi>It may be</hi> (saith he, 205) <hi>the spirituall species of visible things and sounds, do move better downwards then upwards. Those on the top of</hi> Pauls <hi>seem much lesse then they are, but to men above, those below seem nothing so much lessened. So knots in gardens shew best from an upper window.</hi> These examples thwart his (<hi>may be</hi>) for if the species move better downward, how comes it that we see the object better from the top of <hi>Pauls,</hi> then from the street look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upward to the top? Doubtlesse it is because the visible spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the things seen below, move better upward, as being more naturall both for the air which is a light body, and for the species which hath no gravity in it. Hence it is, that when wee stand below, we cannot so clearly discern the just magnitude of the men upon the top of <hi>Pauls,</hi> because the species must come from that high object to our eye downward, which is not so natural. The same may be said of the audible species; for sounds are better heard by those who are in high rooms, then by those who are below: and so they that sit in Church galleries, which are above the Pulpit, hear better then they who sit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in the pues. He speaks against experience when he saith, <hi>There is a greater degree from the privative to the active, that is, from darknesse to light, then from lesse light i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="246" facs="tcp:57373:135"/>
lesse light to more light, as far greater then the other, which was from the privative to the active.</p>
                     <p>He tells us (270) That <hi>in visibles there are not found objects so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> odious and ingrate to the sense, as in audibles; thus the grating of a Saw sets the teeth on edge.</hi> That there are visible objects more ingrate to the eye then audible to the ear, is plan by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, in such as have swounded and fallen suddenly dead at the sight of some objects; some will sweat and fall into strange pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions at the sight of a Cat, others at other sights. <hi>Pompey's</hi> wife fell into a swound when she saw her husbands coat be sprinkled with blood, <hi>Mark Antonies</hi> speech did not so forcibly work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Romans</hi> as the sight of <hi>Caesars</hi> bloody garment, to prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute his murtherers. The phantasie is much more affected by the eye then by the ear. As for the grating of a Saw, by which some mens teeth are set on edge, will not prove what he aimes at, but onely that the teeth are thus affected by reason of that nerve of the fifth conjugation, which sendeth one branch to the ear, and another to the larinx and tongue; as likewise there is a cartaligenous passage between the ear and palat, by which the air received by the mouth, is communicated to the ear. Hence we stop our breath when we will hear attentively, and violent sounds are evacuated by that passage which are recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the ear. But when he saith (276) That <hi>there is no effect of deafnesse found in Canoniers, and such like</hi>; he is again mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: For it is known that divers have lost their hearing by the noyse of Cannous, and other violent sounds. I knew one who grew deaf by being present at a Muster where many Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets were discharged. Again, hee saith (277.) That <hi>when a Skreen is put between the candle and the eye, the light is seen on the paper whereon one writeth, where the body of the flame is not seen.</hi> But indeed neither the flame is seen, because of the Skreen, nor the light on the paper, but the paper by the light: for light is not the object which we see, but by which we see; it actuates the medium, and makes the object visible.</p>

                     <p>WE have shewed out of Anatomy,<note place="margin">283</note> why we hold our breath when we hearken attentively;<note place="margin">284</note> but my Lord gives a reason no way satisfactory: <hi>For</hi> (saith he) <hi>the cause is, for that in all expiration the motion is outward, and therefore rather dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth away the voyce then draweth it.</hi> His Lordship sayes well if we did hear by the mouth; but withall he should have consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,, that in breathing there is inspiration as well as expirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and we hold our breath in hearing attentively, that there may be no inspiration as well as expiration. And indeed it must be a very weak voyce that our breath in expiration drives away. The true cause then as we have shewed, is the free pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of the air between the mouth and ear by means of the pipe or chanell we mentioned; therefore we stay our breath rather from inspiration then expiration, lest the drum in the ear be extended too much with air. He saith,<note place="margin">292</note> 
                        <hi>It conduceth to long life that mens actions be free and voluntary.</hi> If this were so, the abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Monarchs of the world, whose words and commands are laws, and who have none to controll them, should be longer lived then their subjects, who are forced to doe many things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their liking, though not against their will; for all mens actions otherwise are free and voluntary, because they are men, but many times we see slaves live longer then Princes. He tells us, That <hi>time and heat are fellows in many effects</hi>;<note place="margin">294</note> 
                        <hi>for they both are airy and liquifie.</hi> Time and heat cannot be fellows in effects, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause time is no agent, it doth not operate at all, quantities work not, though all things are produced in time; so hony and sugar grow liquid, clay and roots grow dry in time, but not by time. These effects are produced by the heat, drinesse and moisture of the aire, so that sugar waxeth not more liquid by age, but by the air: for keep it twenty years, it will harden or soften according to the weather. So it is not time that harde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the crum of bread, but the heat of the air by drawing in
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:57373:136"/>
insensibly its humidity: and therfore it is rather Poetically spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken then Philosophically, to say that time hardeneth or soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This indeed is to put the syth into <hi>Saturns</hi> hand, and to make him the father and devourer of his own children.<note place="margin">299</note> He alledgeth one cause, <hi>why women live longer then men, because they stir lesse.</hi> But I say that men live longer then women, because they stir more: For by exercise the blood is warmed, the pores are opened, vapours are expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, concoction is helped, the limbs and joynts are strengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, the naturall heat is excited, the spirits and humours are refined. All ages shew us, that no women have ever reached to the age of some men; and it stands with reason that men should be longer lived, because they abound more in naturall heat, which is the cause why the Northern people are longer lived then the Southern. And I have observed, that in the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern parts women are more given to exercise then in the countries farther South; and therefore are longer lived there then here. And my Lord himselfe acknowledgeth, That <hi>exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise hindreth putrifaction,<note place="margin">344</note> and rest furthers it.</hi> Therefore it follows, that men who exercise live longest, because they are furthest from putrifaction.</p>

For that factitious, or rather fictitious gold the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists brag of, is as far from true gold, as a painted fire is from a reall; for neither can it endure the fire, nor comfort the heart, nor hath it any of the qualities or essentiall properties of true gold, I am of <hi>Scaligers</hi> opinion, that it is as easie to change a beast into a man, as to convert any other metall into gold, which were to introduce by Art a specificall form into the matter, which is the work of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I confesse we know but little of those quintessen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall natures; for we are, as the Poet saith,
<q>
                           <l>Curvae in terris animae, &amp; coelestium inanes.</l>

                        <pb n="249" facs="tcp:57373:136"/>
Yet of all opinions this is most consonant to reason, that the starre is homogeneall with its spheare, so that the starre is the heaven contracted, and the heaven in which the starre mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, is the starre dilated; for otherwise wee must make the heaven an heterogeneall body, and consequently organicall, which will prove the vainer opinion of the two. He tells us, That <hi>Oyl is almost nothing else but water digested.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">359</note> I may say it is any thing else rather then water, from which it is so averse, that it will not be united or incorporated with it: and the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects are clean opposite, for water is cold, oyle hot in opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, water putrifieth, oyle resisteth putrifaction; water makes Iron rust, oyle keeps it from rusting; water quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the fire, oyle kindles and feeds it; water is heavy, oyle light, for it vvill still be uppermost; vvater is thin, oyle thick; water is quickly up by heat, and turned into vapours, so is not oyle; water is the food of plants, oyle of men; oyle is apt to be inflamed, so is not water: therefore oyle is rather air or fire then vvater digested.</p>
                     <p>He gives us a strange cause of mans indisposition to motion when Southern winds blow.<note place="margin">381</note> 
                        <hi>The cause</hi> (saith he) <hi>is, that the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours do melt and wax fluid, and so flow into the parts.</hi> How hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours should melt, I know not, except they were congealed like butter, wax, or ice: and where be the parts into which they flow, he tells us not: but indeed the true cause is, the giving (as we call it) or relaxation of the muscles, nerves, and tendons by the warm and mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Much like to this is that saying of his, <hi>Diseases are bred chiefly by heat</hi>; the contrary whereof is apparent, that multitudes of diseases are bread by cold; neither can I yeeld to him in saying, <hi>That it is a superficiall ground,<note place="margin">383</note> that heat and moisture cause putrifaction, because there have been great plagues in dry years.</hi> But by his Lordships leave, the plagues were not bred by the drynesse of the yeare, but by the precedent heat and moisture of the Winter, or Spring, which break out upon the hot and dry Summer, or Autumne, and this hee acknowledgeth in his next Section, where he sheweth,<note place="margin">384</note> That <hi>the cause of diseases is falsly imputed to the constitution of the air at that time when they
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:57373:137"/>
break forth, whereas it proceeds from a precedent sequence and series of the seasons of the year</hi>; and so when he saith, <hi>That in</hi> Barbary <hi>their plagues break up in Summer when the weather is hot and dry</hi>: If this be so, then it is no superficial ground to say that heat and moysture cause putrifaction, seeing it is resisted by hot and dry weather, and indeed it were absurd to think otherways, seeing both experience and reason tells us, that heat and moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <note place="margin">386</note>He makes <hi>Refrigeration of the tongues the cause of stuttering.</hi> If this were so, then old men should stutter more then young men; for old men are colder. But we know the contrary, that not the coldnesse, but rather the over-heating of the tongue causeth stuttering, and this he acknowledgeth in the same Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that <hi>many stutterers are very cholerick men.</hi> But choler is hot, then it seemes that both heat and cold is the cause of stut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering. But indeed the true cause in some is a bad habit or cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom contracted from their infancy, in others eagernesse of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position; for hasty and eager natures usually stutter, and whilst they make the more haste, they use the lesse speed; in others again stuttering proceeds from some infirmity or impedim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As for drinking of wine moderatly, which he saith, <hi>will cause men stut lesse,</hi> is a thing I could never yet observe in those stutterers I have bin acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with. He saith, That <hi>men and beasts move little after their headss are off,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">400</note> 
                        <hi>but in birds the motion remains longer, because the spirit are chiefly in the head &amp; brain, which in men &amp; beasts are large, but birds have smal heads, therfore the spirits are more dispersed in the sinewes.</hi> That the spirits are chiefly in the head &amp; brain, I deny; for the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal spirits are chiefly in the heart. And if the spirits be chiefly in the head and brain, why doth the body separated from the head, move more and longer time then the head? Again, though birds have lesser heads then men and beasts, yet they have heads proportioned to their bodies, and the spirits proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably are as much in their heads, as in mens or beasts heads.
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:57373:137"/>
Moreover, though some men and beasts move little after the head is off, yet some move much: for I saw one beheaded, whose body after it was laid in the coffin, and carried a pretty way from the place of execution, with a violent fit of motion, was like to beat the coffin out of the hands of the bearers; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the true causes of this difference are these, as I conceive, 1. The spirits of birds are more aeriall and fervent then of men and beasts, and in some more, in some lesse; therefore the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of a Cock beheaded will flutter more then of a Goose, or Turkie; and so in beasts, a Cat beheaded will move more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, then of many others: for this reason some men move more then others. 2. The capacity of the vessels may be the cause of this differance; for in men and beasts the veins, arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and nerves, wherein the spirits and blood are contained, be larger then in birds, and therefore in them is a more sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den eruption of the blood &amp; spirits, and consequently a shorter motion then in birds. 3. The weight of the bodies in men and beasts farre exceed the weight of birds bodies, and therefore are not so apt to be moved.</p>

but this opinion is to be rejected.</hi> What he means by vulgar Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy, I know not, but this I know, that the Philosophy: which is vulgarly received by all learned and wise men, hold the transmutation of species impossible: not to God, who could transform <hi>Lots</hi> wife into salt, <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> into a beast, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into blood, a rod into a serpent, and water into wine, but to Art or Nature which cannot transform species, whether we understand the word in the extent and universality, or as it may signifie the individuall nature under such a species: For every individual consists of a matter and a forme, the whole composition cannot be transformed into another compositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor the form to another specificall form, nor the matter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another matter: not the first; for generation is not the changing of one composition into another, but an introduction of a new form into the matter: not the second, for one form al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes perisheth by corruption upon the introduction of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by generation: not the third; for the matter which is the common subject of all mutations, must be alwayes the same in substance, though it receive some alterations in qualities. Transmutation then of species is impossible to Nature, not to Chymists, who think to transform silver into gold: not to the Roman Church, which holds a transubstantiation of bread into Christs body: not unto Poets, who sing of so many metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoses and transformations of men into beasts: nor of those who think Witches can transform themselves into Cats, Hares, and other creatures. He tells us, That <hi>Mushroms cause the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident which we call Incubus, or the Mare in the stomack.</hi> If this were true, in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> where these are ordinarily ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, this disease would reign most: but we find that the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Countries are more subject to the Incubus then the Southern. Many then eat Mushroms who never were troubled with this disease, many are troubled with it who never eat them. But indeed the Incubus, or Mare, is no disease of the stomack, as he saith, but of the Diaphragma and lungs, which being oppressed by a thick flegme or melancholy, send up gross vapours into the throat, by which speech is hindred, and into the brain by which the imagination is disturbed.</p>

For that accretion of stones, and other inanimate things, is an apposition of externall matter, not an extension of the parts by an internall agent, converting the nutriment into the thing nourished. And how can stones, or such hard bodies have extension, whereas they want humidity, which is the cause of extension. Besides, accretion is a supply of deperdition; for where there is diminution of parts, by means of the heat ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausting the radicall moisture, there must be restauration <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Therefore there maybe an outward agglutination or aggregation of stones without ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation; but an accretion properly so called, there cannot be.

And whereas the worm dieth when it comes out of the snow, this proceedes not (as he saith) <hi>from the exhaling of the worms spirits, which was shut in by the cold,</hi> but rather from the chilling of that spirit which was kept in by heat: for whilst it was under the snow, the worm was kept warm from the piercing air which now kilsit.<note place="margin">697</note> He saith, That <hi>the flies called Ephemer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The cause therefore of short and long life, is the goodnesse or badnesse of the crasis and temperament of the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical moisture, and its due or undue proportion with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural heat, the symatrie or assymatrie of the four humours, and first qualities, and the conformity of the organs. As for the Suns absence, that cannot be a cause of short life: For, 1. the Sun is never absent in his vertue, efficacy, and influence. 2. Many creatures prosper best in shades, as plants. 3. In those Northern parts where the body and light of the Sun is not seen in many moneths together, yet multitudes of creatures are generated and live there. 4. It seems that the <hi>Ephemera</hi> are hurt rather by the Suns presence then absence: for <hi>Scaliger</hi> writes (<hi>Exer.</hi> 194.5.) That those <hi>Ephemera</hi> flies which he had seen, were always to be seen in the evening, never at the Sun rising, and one of them which he had caught, lived all night, but died in the morning.

He also contradicteth experience when he saith,<note place="margin">825</note> That <hi>Fish hating the dry will not approach the air till it grow moist.</hi> For vve see that fish play most upon the top of the vvaters in hot and dry Summers, and in the hottest and driest time of the day, when the Sun is in his Me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>His Lordship is pleased to call the received opinion,<note place="margin">836</note> 
                        <hi>That putrifaction is caused by cold, or preternaturall heat, but nugation.</hi> But if cold be not the cause of putrifaction, how comes it that Apples and Cabbages doe rot in frosty vveather? And if pere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grine heat be not the cause, how comes it that in hot and moist years and places, pestilentiall Feavers, and other putrid dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases doe reigne? Besides, abundance of vermin; doubtlesse these are procreated of putrifaction, and this of heat, except we will forfeit our senses and reason; of which he being afraid, confesseth at last, that such a heat tendeth to dissolution. He will not have liquifaction to proceed from any of the foure prime qualities, that he calls an inutile speculation, but from his own phantomes.<note place="margin">840</note> 
                        <hi>For bodies</hi> (saith he) <hi>that are more turgid of spirit, or that have their spirits more straitly imprisoned as metals, or that hold them better pleased and content as butter, are liquifiable.</hi> How happy then are those spirits which dwell in butter, where they have pleasure and content, in comparison of those vvretched spirits vvhich are imprisoned in Irons and other metals, and yet how these spirits should make the metall turgid, I know not. Surely these are but crasie fansies, vvhereas it is apparent to all ntelligible men, that these things are most liquifiable, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundeth most with congealed moisture, whether it be aeriall
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:57373:142"/>
and oily, as in pitch, butter, wax, and grease; or watrish alone, as in Ice; or of a middle nature between both; or peculiar, as the moisture of metals. And to tell us, That <hi>wood, clay, free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, &amp;c. are not liquifiable, because they are bodies jejune of spirits,</hi> is ridiculous; for there are more spirits in vegitables then in metals: and it is plain, that clay and stones melt not, because they want moysture, which is in metals. So it is not <hi>the dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the spirits</hi> (as he saith) <hi>by heat, which causeth wax to melt at the fire</hi>; but the rarefaction of the moysture by heat, which was before contracted by the cold. For this cause dry wood is more fragile then green, stone then metall, and fictile earth then crude, because there is no moisture in the one compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the moisture of the other.</p>

                        <note place="margin">844</note>He tels us, <hi>that the hardnes of body is caused chiefly by the jejuness of the spirits.</hi> Indeed this Philosophy is somwhat jejun; for I would fain know whether there be not more spirits and less jejune in the hard bodies of Cloves, Nutmegs, and Cinnamon, then in the soft bodies of Wooll, Silk, and Cotton? According to his Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy there is a greater quantity of Spirits in a pellet of but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, because softer, then in a Nutmeg which is harder; he that beleeves this, let him when he is troubled with flatulencies in his stomack, use butter, and not hard spices. He saith, That <hi>Moisture doth chiefly colour hair; but driness turneth them gray and white.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">851</note> In his Philosophy then gray and white are not colours, nor indeed blacknes, which he saith afterwards, <hi>is but a privative,</hi> and consequently hath no entity.<note place="margin">873</note> 
                        <hi>Aristotle</hi> indeed sometimes calls black a privation; but there he useth the words in a large sense: for if it were properly privative, how could other co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours be made of black and white, seeing of habits and priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions nothing can be made.<note place="margin">853</note> He saith, That <hi>some fishes be greater then any beasts, because these have not their moisture drawn by the air and sun-beams. Also they rest always in a manner, and are suppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the water.</hi> If these be the reasons of fishes greatness, then why are Smelts and other lesser fishes, smaller then the beasts? Or why are they not as big as Whales, seeing neither air nor sun-beams draw away their moisture, and are also supported by the water? The true cause then of the bigness of fishes above the beasts, is the predominance of moisture in them, which is easily extendible. And indeed it is a frivolous thing to give reasons for the different magnitudes of the creatures, seeing Nature hath given to each creature a determinate magnitude and period of duration. And whereas he thinks, that fish doe rest in a manner when they swim, because they are supported
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:57373:142"/>
by the water; he may as well say, That beasts and men rest when they walk and run, because supported by the earth: they that swim find there is no rest, but labour and motion.</p>
                     <p>Before my Lord told us, That <hi>by heat in putrifaction the spirits are emitted, suppressed, and suffocated</hi>: But now he saith,<note place="margin">836</note> That <hi>the spirits in putrifaction gather heat.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">856</note> How the spirits at the same time should be destroyed by the heat, and yet gather heat, is so sublime a fansie, that no fansie but his own can reach it.<note place="margin">865</note> 
                        <hi>Water</hi> (saith he) <hi>being contiguous with air cooleth it, but moystneth it not, except it vapour, because heat &amp; cold have a virtuall transaction with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out communication of substance, but moysture not.</hi> He takes it for granted, which no Philosophy will grant him, to wit, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents can passe from one subject to another without their substance, which is to make accidents subsist by themselves, and to be all one with the substance, which is repugnant to sense and reason: therefore without vapours neither can the water moysten nor cool the air. He saith, <hi>Air is not without some secret degree of heat.</hi> He needs make no secret of it, for it is manifest,<note place="margin">866</note> that the air is hot and moist, as the fire is hot and dry; but for any secret degree of light in the air, I deny: For though (as he saith) Cats and Owles see in the night, this is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is any degree of light in the air; for what light can there be in a dark dungeon where yet a Cat can see? The air is not a light body of it self, being diaphanous; for the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiall sphears are not light, neither is there any luminous body in the dark Dungeon, except the Cats eyes, which afford light enough to the Cat to see his object. He gives us a reason why the limbs on the right side are stronger, <hi>Because motion is holpen from the liver.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">876</note> How the liver should help motion, is not known in Anatomy, seeing motion and its Organs are from the brain, not from the liver: He had better have said, that motion is hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen from the heart, and so might have inferred, that the left side limbs are strongest. But indeed the true cause why the right side is stronger then the left, is, because the right limbs are bigger: but why Nature made them bigger or stronger, no other reason can be given, then that the right side is hotter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is the fountain of blood. He saith, That <hi>all spongie bodies expell the air, and draw in liquor.</hi> This is not so;<note place="margin">884</note> for why should such a body expell the air and draw in liquor; but when the liquor enters into a spongie body the air gives place as a void penetration: therefore Sugar expels not the air to suck up the Wine, but the wine enters into the Sugar, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels the air, so that the Sugar is a meer patient. He tells us,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:57373:143"/>
That <hi>stone walls are not so wholsom as wood, or bricks.</hi> This asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on stands neither with experience nor reason;<note place="margin">937</note> for they who have lived with their predecessors within stone walls many hundreths of years, never found any unwholsomnesse by the stones, and it is against reason, that dry stones, who as he phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth it, are jejune of spirits, should afford any vapours, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholsom damps. It's true, that in moyst weather there be some Sea-stones, or such as are taken out of Rivers, will sweat; but I have seen such drops upon brick-walls. This proceeds neither from the stone nor brick, but from the air, which falling upon the hard stone, and being resisted for want of pores, from pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating, stayeth there, and by the coldness of the stone turns to water-drops,<note place="margin">954</note> even upon Marble. <hi>It is certain,</hi> saith he, <hi>that potions, incense, perfumes, an oyntments, do naturally work upon the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> The contrary rather is certain, to wit, that the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion worketh upon these, not they upon it: for according to the strength of imagination the physick works, and not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the strength of physick doth the imagination work. For sometimes the smell or sight of physick have wrought, not upon the imagination, but upon the body by the power of ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, so that this is the prime cause why the physick work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, which will not work at all in others whose imagination is weak and dull.</p>

                        <hi>The cramp</hi> (saith he) <hi>cometh of contraction of sinews either by cold or drinesse.</hi> The cramp cometh by distention as well as by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, by heat and moistnesse as well as by cold and driness. A Lute string wil break as soon in moist weather when it swels, as in dry weather when it shrinks. And <hi>Hippocrates</hi> tells us, that the cramp proceeds as well fromrepletion as from inanition: for gluttony, drunkennesse, and suppressing of accustomed eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuations, procure the cramp as well as fasting, watching, blee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, burning fevers, and vomiting, chiefly by <hi>Hellebor,</hi> which I can speak to my grief: for I never knew what the cramp was, till I was let blood and purged with <hi>Hellebor</hi> by an unskilfull Physician. And indeed the cramp is not so much the affection of the sinews, as of the muscles; for it is the involuntary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of the muscle to its originall or beginning, because not the nerve but the muscle, is the proper instrument of motion, which by the cramp is hurt; so that this infirmity hath diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent names from the different muscles in which it is. If it be in the muscles of the eye, it is called <hi>Stratismus</hi>
                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the yard, <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyriasis</hi>; in the muscle of the jaw-bone, <hi>Trismus</hi>; in the muscles of the mouth, <hi>Spasmus Cynicus,</hi> or the Dog-cramp. In the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lepsie
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:57373:143"/>
also, or falling sicknesse, there is a kind of cramp. And many times the cramp proceeds from flatulencies in the mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, which though they be the proper organs of convulsions, or cramps, yet the cause is many times in the nerves, which being contracted by the sharpnesse or fulnesse of humors, or by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant vapours, draw the muscles with them.</p>
                     <p>Because the Hedg-hog putteth forth many prickles, therfore he inferres,<note place="margin">979</note> That <hi>the juyce af a Hedg-hog must needs be harsh and dry.</hi> There is no necessity for this, because the harsh &amp; dry mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is expelled by nature into the prickles. The flesh of some fishes, whose shells or skins are full of prickles, is neither harsh nor dry. The Rose sends forth many prickles, and yet it is both pleasant, odoriferous, cooling and moist. So are the Respberries. He tells us, That <hi>Mummy hath a great force in stanch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of blood.</hi> But I wish he could tell us where we may find it:<note place="margin">980</note> For the true <hi>Mummy</hi> which was found in the Tombes of the AEgyptian Kings, which were embalmed vvith divers pretious liquors and spices, are spent long agoe, so that the <hi>Mummy</hi> now in use is only the substance of dried Karkasses digged out of the sands, being overwhelmed there, in which there is no more vertue to stanch blood, then in a stick. He saith, <hi>All life hath a sympathy with salt.</hi> In hogges I think its true;<note place="margin">982</note> for as life is the salt of a living hogge, so salt is the life of a dead hogge: For both life and s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But he is mistaken vvhen he saith, <hi>That salt draweth blood, because being laid to a cut finger, healeth it.</hi> For salt is laid to a cut finger, not to draw the blood, vvhich cometh too fast of it selfe vvithout drawing; but to repell the blood, and to stop its running. It heals them, not by drawing the blood, but by abstersion, exsiccation, astriction and resisting putrifaction.</p>
                     <p>Thus I have cursorily run over my Lords new Philosophy, vvhich he calls a <hi>Wood,</hi> and so it is indeed; for here a young Scholar may quickly lose himselfe, and shal encounter with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny bryers and brambles. I find that Phylosophy is like Wine, the older the better to the taste; new Wine is pleasant, and so are new conscripts to the mind: but to the intelligent man oldest is wholsomest and lesse flatulent. And indeed that which they call new Philosophy, is nothing but the old in a new dressing, vvhich is neither so handsome nor so usefull as the other. They have found out new terms, which are neither so proper nor significant as the former. They have metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phosed
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:57373:144"/>
the elementary qualities both first and second, into spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, so that now this word, like a nose of wax, serves them for all shapes. I find in my Lords book much dross mingled with his gold; he doth wrong both himself and his reader, in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking to give the causes or reasons of every thing: For Nature is pleased in thousands of things, to sport herselfe with variety. Who can give the cause of so many different forms in beasts, birds, and fishes; of so many different shapes and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours in herbs, trees, and plants; of so many different streaks and spots in shels, stones, and other things. He that takes upon him to give reasons of all these varieties, will take too much upon him. But as <hi>Scaliger</hi> saith, It is the part of true wisdom not to be too wise.</p>
                     <p>Wheras <hi>Aristotle</hi> had with infinite pains and industry, and not without singular dexterity, reduced all entities into certain heads, and placed them in ten Classes, or Predicaments to avoid confusion, and that we might with the more facility find out the true genus and difference of things, for our more easie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining, describing, dividing of things, and methodicall arguing upon any subject. Which <hi>Aristotelian</hi> way hath been received and approved by all Universities, and the wise men since his time in all ages, as being the best, easiest, most methodical, and most consonant to Reason, of all the vvayes yet found out: These new Philosophers, as if they were wiser then all the world besides, have like fantastick travellers, left the old bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and known path, to find out wayes unknown, crooked and unpassable, and have reduced his comely order into the old chaos, jumbling the Predicaments so together, that their Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars can never find out the true genus of things. For example, they tell us, that the qualities, to wit, of heat, cold, &amp;c. are spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, consequently substances; so somtimes again they will have these to be qualities, and sometimetimes to be motions and actions. Thus <hi>Proteus</hi>-like they turn themselves into all shapes, so that we know not in what predicament to put their heat, or what Genus to give it. <hi>Comenius</hi> in his reformed Physicks, gives us some wise reasons to prove that heat is motion, because forsooth <hi>There is not with us a body that is perpetually hot.</hi> Besides that this is false, for our fire is perpetually hot, and never cold, water perpetually moist and never dry, the air perpetually light and never heavy, the earth perpetually heavy and never light; so it is ridiculous to think, that whatsoever is not either per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually hot or cold, moist or dry, &amp;c. must be motion: for by this reason all sublunary entities must be motions, because
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:57373:144"/>
there is no other permanent quality except in a few. But let us examine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Pabsurdities of this conceit. 1. If heat, cold, and other qualities be motions, then they are all imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect entities, for motion is such, as being (in <hi>fieri,</hi> not in <hi>facto.</hi>) But this is untrue; for all qualities are perfect entities in their own kind. 2. Rest is the perfection and end of motion; but it is not the end and perfection of heat and cold: for the cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of a standing Lake is not more perfect because it rests, then of a river because it moves. 3. Rest is opposite to motion, cold is opposite to heat, how then can heat and cold be moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? 4. Motion is (<hi>commune sensibile</hi>) an object of divers senses, for it is perceptible by the eye, by the ear in sounds, and by the tact also; but heat and cold are onely perceptible to the tact. 5. Motion addeth weight to a heavy body; it is the motion of the Cutter that makes the Ax cut down the tree, whereas nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the heat nor coldnesse of the Ax addeth any thing to the action of the Ax. 6. Motion begets heat, therefore they cannot be the same, except wee will make one and the same entity to work upon, and produce it selfe, to be both cause and effect, agent and patient to it selfe, which is an absurd contradiction. 7. It is not motion but heat that attenuateth, penetrateth, ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, ripeneth, dissolveth, congregateth homogeneous things, &amp; disgregateth heterogeneous. Again, they reason thus (<hi>Comen. Phys. c.</hi> 4.) <hi>that heat penetrates and distends, cold stoppeth &amp; contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, therfore they are motions.</hi> They may as well infer, that light is a motion, because it penetrateth glasse, or that wine-vinegar, oyles, or any substance that penetrates, are motions, which are childish conceits. And no lesse feeble is their third Argument, whereby they prove heat to be a motion, <hi>Because it wasteth and consumeth even the hardest metals.</hi> Heat preserveth as well as wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth. Is it a motion in both regards? Again, is there no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the agent and the action, the mover and the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the waster and the wasting of a thing?</p>
                     <p>As in many other vain conceits they shew their weaknesse, so likewise in this, when they call colours light, and say, <hi>(Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. c.</hi> 4) <hi>That colours of themselves have no entity, but from the light, because they are not seen without the light.</hi> Thus they confound (after their maner) the object (which) &amp; the mean (by which) we see. We see colours, we see not the light, but we see by the light. This doctrine, if there bee no entity in colours, but what is given by thelight, then in darknesse there must be non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor milk white within the breasts, till they be let out into the light. What can be more ridiculous then to think, that because the light gives, visibility, therefore it gives entity to things. To a blind man all colours are non-entities, which to him that seeth them are entities at the same time; so at the same time colours are something and nothing. My Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> saith, That the colours of Gems are fine spirits, how then can they be be non-entities? And surely, if whatsoever we see not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be non-entities, we may conclude that substances are non-entities, for they are not visible: and if it be the light that giveth being to colours, it must needs follow, that black hairs turn gray in us, not from the constitution of our temperaments, but from the light: and so it is onely the light that makes some black, some red, some flaxen, and some gray haired. Again, they say, (<hi>c.</hi> 4.) <hi>Colour diffuseth it selfe through the air, as light doth, therefore it is light.</hi> This is untrue; for colour doth not diffuse it self through the air as light doth: for the colour of a Rose is onely in the Rose, and not diffused in the air; they should rather say, That the smell of the Rose is diffused through the air, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the smell is light, or that heat and cold are lights, because they are diffused. Again, they say, (<hi>c.</hi> 4.) <hi>That the light produceth in the Rain-bow different colours.</hi> What then? Will it follow that therefore the light produceth all colours? Wil they make no difference between reall and apparent or intentionall co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours? The colour which is in a green glasse, is reall; but that which from the glasse is cast on the paper, is onely apparent. The colour of my face is reall, but not in the looking-glasse, there it is onely apparent. If light makes colours, why makes it not snow black, and coals white. Lastly, they tell us, (<hi>c.</hi> 4.) <hi>That specificall forms are made up of qualities.</hi> If this be so, then things cannot differ specifically one from another: for what differs in qualities, differs onely accidentally; and so must a man differ from a horse: one man differs from another onely in qualities; but if he differ onely in qualities, then <hi>Alexander</hi> and his horse <hi>Bucephalus</hi> are specifically the same. But whence proceed these qualities which make the difference? not from the matter, for in this they differ not; not from themselves, for nothing can produce it self. It remains then, that they result from the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiall form, from which all proper and specificall accidents have their dependence, both in entity and operation. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to deny the substantiall form, is to deny the composition and generation of things; for in all compounded bodies there must be two parts at least to make up the composition, and
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:57373:145"/>
these can be none else but matter and form. For qualities are no parts, nor can they make a composition with the substance. And whereas the end of generation is the production of the form, there would be no generation at all, if qualities only were produced; alteration there may be, generation there can be none.</p>
