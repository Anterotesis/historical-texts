         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p> I know, that to the ayd, and furtherance of some great enterprize, and design, there is more required then <hi>Wishes</hi> and <hi>Desires;</hi> and therefore (as to the building of the <hi>Lords House,</hi> every one brought some thing, according to his ability, so) to the Prosperous successe, and happy issue, of this long desired <hi>Parliament, </hi>there is required not only a Religious care, and endeavour in your Honours; but also, that we (whose causes you are pleased to agitate, and manage, and whose <hi>grievances</hi> you take in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your <hi>grave considerations)</hi> should afford unto your Honours that furtherance, and assistance, which lyes in our power; that is, both in zealous, and fervent calling upon God for you, and in a modest, and humble enforming, and advising of you.</p>

The secious Animadversion hereof, emboldened your humble <hi>Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> to present this <hi>Petition</hi> (for it is no other) unto your Honours, for <hi>Unity, and Unanimity in Religion among yourselves,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering with my self, the necessity, and excellency of the <hi>Theam,</hi> (for the furtherance of your <hi>Christian consultations,</hi> and <hi>deep designes)</hi> and that none as yet have tendred any <hi>Treatise</hi> unto your Honours of this <hi>Subject.</hi>

            <p>As fair faces need no Painting, nor good Wine a gaudy Bush; So a rare and transcendent Subject, needs no <hi>poor Oratory</hi> to praise it, nor affected Language to set it forth. And therefore, I will not make any <hi>Encomions</hi> in commendation of that religious <hi>Amity</hi> and <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> which should shine, and shew forth it self, in your Honours; but only give you a short hint of the necessity, and excellency thereof, and then referre your Honours to the pious consideration of the <hi>Treatise</hi>

His <hi>word,</hi> or <hi>Motto</hi> is, <hi>Unum nihil, duos plurimum posse, One is as good as none, but two can do much.</hi> The decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and amplification of the <hi>Embleme</hi> is expressed in these verses:</p>

            <p>The <hi>first</hi> of these <hi>three</hi> is the <hi>Subject</hi> of our <hi>Text,</hi> and hath two <note place="margin">Division of the Text.</note> parts, <hi>Vinculum,</hi> and <hi>Exemplum;</hi> the <hi>Conjunction</hi> [that <hi>they may be one]</hi> and the <hi>Declaration,</hi> [as <hi>thou art in me, and I in thee.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will treat only of the <hi>first part.</hi> That <hi>they may be one:</hi> wherein if I should dive curiously into circumstances, these things would occurre, and offer themselves to our consideration, <hi>Viz.</hi> 1. Who prayes? 2. To whom he prayes? 3. For whom he prayes? <hi>Viz.</hi> 1. Of what nature they are for whom he prayes? <hi>Mine.</hi> And 2. Of what number they are? <hi>All mine.</hi> 4. What means he useth to obtain what he desires? <hi>Viz. Prayer.</hi> And 5. What is prayed for? But passing by the <hi>four former,</hi> I will insist only upon the <hi>last,</hi> which is the principall; <hi>That all Christs members may be one, and conjoyned in one holy, and spirituall bond of Unity.</hi> But before I shew the nature of this <hi>Union;</hi> I will resolve a <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion</hi> or two, for the better understanding of the <hi>Text.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How many wayes are things said to be <hi>One,</hi> that our Saviours <note place="margin">Question. 1.</note> here prayes, That his children <hi>may be One?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Things are said to be <hi>One</hi> five manner of wayes; to wit, <note place="margin">Things are said to be One five wayes.</note>
            </p>
            <p>First, <hi>Naturally,</hi> As the soul and body make one man.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Artificially,</hi> As wood, stones, and timber, make one house. <note place="margin">Answer.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Mystically,</hi> As Christ and his Church make one body.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>Mysteriously,</hi> As the husband, and wife are one. And</p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>Spiritually,</hi> As all the faithfull are one in Christ.</p>
            <p>And thus our Saviour prayes, <hi>That his children may be One.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How many wayes may <hi>One thing</hi> be made of <hi>Many,</hi> that our Saviour here prayes, that his <hi>children,</hi> who are <hi>Many,</hi> may be made <note place="margin">Question 2:</note> 
               <hi>One?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>One thing</hi> may be made of <hi>Many,</hi> six manner of wayes; as <note place="margin">One thing is made of Many six wayes.</note> namely.</p>

3. By <hi>Alteration,</hi> When the first perfect form is altered; as of many Grapes is made one Vessell of Wine. And</p>
            <p n="4">4. When one thing is made of <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>form;</hi> as Utensils, and the like Artificiall things are. And</p>

            </p>
            <p>Secondly, For the mindes undivided simplicity. And <note place="margin">Answer.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, For a multitudes aggregated community.</p>
            <p>The first, Unity is superiour, and is to be admired.</p>
            <p>The second is interiour, and is to be imitated.</p>
            <p>The third is exteriour, and is to be aggregated, and heaped together.</p>
            <p>The first Unity is of highest dignity.</p>
            <p>The second is of the mindes simplicity.</p>
            <p>The third is of a joynt, and Christian fraternity.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Text</hi> speaks of the <hi>Last,</hi> in which sense <hi>Unity</hi> and <hi>Unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Unity twosold.</note> is in a manner the same; and is twosold; to wit,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Aggregative,</hi> And is so called, because it consists of many persons added, or joyned together in one <hi>Assembly;</hi> and thus any <hi>Nationall Church</hi> is <hi>One;</hi> that is, <hi>One in profession,</hi> as <hi>many members</hi> joyned together, make <hi>one body.</hi> And</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Compositive,</hi> When not only <hi>many</hi> are joyned together <hi>in one Assembly,</hi> and profession; but also in minde, and affection, one participating of the qualities of another. And of this <hi>Union</hi> the <hi>Text</hi> principally speaks, as will appear by and by.</p>
            <p>What <hi>Union</hi> or <hi>Unity</hi> doth the <hi>Text</hi> speak of? <note place="margin">Union two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sold.</note>
            </p>
            <p>First, There is <hi>Unity</hi> in errour, conspiracy, bloud, and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: as is evident from <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. 4. <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 10, 11. 14. <hi>Luke</hi> 23. <note place="margin">Question 4.</note> 12. <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 24, 25, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But this being not of Christ, is without <note place="margin">Answer 1.</note> the lists, and limits of our <hi>Text,</hi> which speaks only of <hi>an boly U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in Him.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:94346:6"/>
Secondly, That holy Union whereof our Text speaks, is two <note place="margin">Answ. 2.</note> severall wayes divided; Namely,</p>
            <p n="1">1. In respect of the Object, or Persons; and so it is, either 1. Of the Members among themselves. Or 2. Of the Body with the Head. And both these <hi>Unions</hi> are found in 1 <hi>Job.</hi> 1. 3. And</p>
            <p n="2">2. In respect of the <hi>subject matter;</hi> and so it is, either 1. In minde and opinion. Or 2. In heart, and affection. Both which <hi>Vnions</hi> are found in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 11.</p>
            <p>From these two distinctions, come three sorts <hi>of boly Vnion,</hi>

            <p>First, Sowers of discord, and dissention, and disturbers of the <note place="margin">1.

            </p>
            <p>Secondly, These Sowers of dissention, and Broachers of divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">2. Sewers of discord, rend Christs Coat.</note> in doct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>Thirdly, As dissentions are fruits of the fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>But Popery is such a Religion. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>

But <hi>unà voce,</hi> they cry out, The <hi>Minor</hi> is false, and dare me to prove it; which I will do particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, and plainly, but briefly, (although I could both adde more particulars, and more enlarge these then I have) that the world, and all them who view this <hi>Treatise,</hi> may see, that I do them no wrong.</p>
            <p>First, I say, <hi>Popery,</hi> is a <hi>Superstitious Religion;</hi> for God will <note place="margin">1.

But the Papists say, That God must be worshipped, according to the Traditions, Ceremonies, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions of the Roman Church; and that the Constitutions of the Pope do equall in value the Gospel of Christ, <hi>Dist.</hi> 15. <hi>cap.

In their Transubstantiation: for Christ our Prophet, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of the holy Spirit, and born of the Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> but their Christ is not begotten, but created; whence they say, That the sacrificing Priest in the celebration of the Masse creates his Creator. Again, Christ our Prophet, was born of the flesh of <hi>Mary,</hi> and the seed of <hi>David;</hi> but the Papists Christ is created of bread. Again, our Christ is the same to day, and tomarrow, and for ever. But the Papists Christ, was not yesterday, or the day or hour before the consecration of the hoast. And</p>
            <p>Thirdly, From his Priestly office, while they deny him to be the alone propitiatory sacrifice for sin, and the only Mediator, and Intercessor, between God and man. For they say,</p>

And</p>
            <p n="2">2 Endeavour earnestly after this <hi>Unity</hi> and <hi>Unanimity,</hi> in the advancing of the truth, and true Religion, remembring, That Christ hathe treated his Father, and your Father, to work this holy Unity of minde, opinion, and spirit, in you, as <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, commanding his souldiers to ascend a Mountain dangerous, and full of Snow, and perceiving them timerous, leaped off his horse, and led them the way, and then they coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geously followed.

               <hi>Wherein your Honours should be one.</hi> Now</p>
            <p>Thirdly, We have in order to prescribe the <hi>Means,</hi> whereby
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:94346:23"/>
you may be one; but because they are divers, I will therefore be the briefer in them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Meanes</hi> are these; namely,</p>
            <p>First, Labour that you may all be the faithfull of the Lord, <note place="margin">Means 1.</note> and the Lords faithfull ones; and then he will make you one for the good of his Church, as is implicitely promised in this His prayer, as was shewed before. The members of the body will admit of no fractions, divisions, rents, nor jarres amongst themselves; but have all one joynt desire, and endeavour for the good of the whole; because that good which is communicated to the whole, is extended to all, and every each member of the body: Even so, if all the members of your Honourable Assembly, be the faithfull members of Christ, then he will so unite your hearts, affections, desires, and endeavours, that as one man you shall all labour af<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>r <hi>this holy Union of truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Because either Christ must work this <hi>boly Unity of</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Means 2.</note> 
               <hi>Truth</hi> in you, or you cannot have it, another means to procure it is prayer unto him; and that both by the <hi>Commons</hi> and <hi>Common-wealth</hi> for <hi>you,</hi> an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> 
               <hi>by you</hi> for <hi>your selves.</hi> But I enlarge neither of these, because in my <hi>pious mans practise in Parliament time</hi> (which I put forth at the beginning of the Parliament, to teach the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of the Land their duty in the time, and for the continuance, of this Honourable <hi>Assembly)</hi> I have largely, and amply shewed and handled the <hi>first</hi> of these; <hi>viz.</hi> How the <hi>Land</hi> should assist your <hi>Lordships</hi> with their prayers unto the Lord of glory for you; and by and by, I shall touch upon the <hi>second; viz.</hi> How your Honours ought to petition the Throne of grace, for this grace of <hi>truth,</hi> and <hi>unity of Spirit</hi> amongst your selves.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Let your meeting, convening, and assembling toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Means 3.</note> be in the Name of Christ; and then (according to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise) he will be present with you <note n="t" place="margin">Matth. 18. 20.</note>: I need not enlarge this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>Vincentius</hi> himself consesseth <note n="u" place="margin">Serm. hyem. pag. 544.</note>, That when the Rulers or Governours of a City.

But your Honours are thus convened, and gathered together; and therefore in the

name, power, spirit, and vertue of Christ; and consequently he will be in the midst of you; that is, <hi>he will be present with you, and president amongst you.</hi> Wherefore, if as you are assembled by the power of Christ, with an unanimous accord, desire, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, you make his glory, the advancement of Religion, the peace of the Church, and prosperity of the Common-wealth, your prime, and principall end and aym, then Christ will be both <hi>present with you,</hi> and <hi>president amongst you.</hi> And so this shall be a <hi>third means</hi> to procure this <hi>holy Union,</hi> and <hi>Unitie of Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, Another excellent means to procure this grace, is <note place="margin">Means 4.</note> a serious, and sedulous animadversion of the benefit which will redound thereby, both unto our Church and State.

            <p n="1">1. Because the designes of the Priests, and Jesuites, and other Adherents to the Sea of <hi>Rome,</hi> have of late been more boldly, and frequently put in practise, then formerly; to the undermining, and danger, of the ruine of the true reformed Religion amongst us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Because some have endeavoured to subvert the fundamentall Laws of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and to introduce the exercise of an Arbitrary, and Tyrannicall Government amongst us.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Because many illegall taxations have been levied, and laid, of late upon the Subjects, to their great grievance, and oppression.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Because divers innovations, and superstitions have of late been brought into our Church; and an Oath devised to make us practise, and perpetually to maintain them.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Because many have been exiled, and the mouthes of many Ministers stopt, for these Innovations, and Superstitions, and other Ceremonies.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Because some have endeavoured to raise, and soment jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies, between the King, and his people, <hi>Ezra</hi> 4. 13, 14, 15.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Because Armies have been raised in <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> of dangerous consequence; to wit,</p>
            <p>First, For the making, or taking part with the Conspirators, as hath been confessed, or discovered by some. And</p>
            <p>Secondly, For the weakning of the Land, by a consumption of the Treasure thereof, making us thereby lye more open to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign invasion.</p>
            <p>Wherefore should both Prince, Peers, Parliamentaries, and <note place="margin">Question. 5.</note> People, or Commons, make such a <hi>Protestation,</hi> or <hi>Promise,</hi> at such <hi>times,</hi> or upon such <hi>occasions,</hi> as were named even now?</p>

            <p>How many things are observable in this <hi>Protestation,</hi> or <hi>Vow?</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Question 6.</note>

            <p>First, The <hi>Matter</hi> of this <hi>Protestation,</hi> and <hi>Vow,</hi> must be <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,</hi> and <hi>Religious;</hi> respecting <hi>God, Religion,</hi> the <hi>King,</hi> the <hi>Laws,</hi> the <hi>Liberties</hi> of the <hi>Subject,</hi> the <hi>Patriots</hi> of the <hi>Land,</hi> the <hi>enemies</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> and the <hi>union</hi> or <hi>unity</hi> of the <hi>Kingdomes united.</hi> Particularly,</p>

            <p n="2">2. This <hi>Protestation</hi> must respect <hi>Religion;</hi> for when we see <hi>That</hi> in some eminent, and apparent danger, and that <hi>It</hi> is like to be justled, and shouldred out of the doors of <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>State,</hi> by

And</p>
            <p n="4">4. This <hi>Protestation</hi> must respect the <hi>Laws of the Land,</hi> the <hi>power</hi> and <hi>priviledges of Parliaments,</hi> and the <hi>liberties</hi> of the <hi>Subject;</hi> for when (by the malice, mischief, and treachery of any) <hi>Laws</hi> are in danger to be subverted, <hi>Parliaments</hi> stinted, and straitned, and <hi>people</hi> to be envassalled, and deprived of their immunities, and priviledges, Then all (so far as Religion and Law will allow them) by some religious <hi>Protestation</hi> and <hi>Vow,</hi> should unite themselves, for the maintenance, and defence of their <hi>liberties</hi> and <hi>laws.</hi> And</p>
            <p n="5">5.

            <p n="6">6. This <hi>Protestation</hi> must respect the <hi>enemies of Church,</hi> and <hi>State;</hi> for we must oppose as farre as lawfully we may, and by all good wayes, and means endeavor to bring to condign punishment,

all such as shall by force, practise, counsell, plots, conspiraci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p n="7">7. This <hi>Protestation</hi> must respect the <hi>three Kingdoms,</hi> now united by their <hi>one</hi> thrice noble <hi>Head;</hi> For every one should seriously, (in all just and honourable wayes) endeavour to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the union and peace, between the three Kingdoms, <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi> And thus much for the <hi>Matter</hi> of this <hi>Protestation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, The next thing observeable in this <hi>Protestation,</hi> is the <hi>Manner</hi> thereof, <hi>how it must be made; viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Solemnly, reverend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p n="2">2. Sincerely, cordially, and in truth, because made, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised unto God, who must be worshipped in Spirit, and in Truth, <hi>John</hi> 4. 24.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Faithfully, for the thing protested must be performed. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises made unto men must be performed, much more unto God, <hi>Psal.</hi> 89. 38. And hence people are commanded, Not to forget their Covenant with God, <hi>Jere.</hi> 50. 5. And therefore the promises we make unto God, and our Protestations, and Vows made in the presence of God, must be performed, and neither for hope, fear, nor other respects must be relinquished, <hi>Nehe.</hi> 5. 12, 13.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Cheerfully, and with joy, <hi>Nehe.</hi> 8. 9, 12.</p>
            <p n="5">5. In manner of an Oath, <hi>Ezra</hi> 10. 3. 5.</p>
            <p n="6">6. With a penalty for refusall, <hi>Ezra</hi> 10. 7, 8.</p>
            <p n="7">7. With praise unto God. Note here. That we in this Land, have at this time, great cause, to praise, and magnifie the Name of our God; as namely,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Because he hath chosen us out of the world, <hi>Nehe.</hi> 8. 7.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Because he hath looked upon our afflictions, <hi>Nehe.</hi> 9. 9.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Because he hath seen our fasting, and heard our prayers, <hi>Nehe</hi> 9. 9. 27.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Because he hath destroyed our enemies, <hi>Nehe.</hi> 9. 10, 11.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Because he hath guided, and assisted our Patriots, and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentaries, in their counsels, and consultations, <hi>Nehe.</hi> 9 12.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:94346:27"/>
6. Because he hath been mercifull unto us in this Land, above our merits, <hi>Nehe.</hi> 9. 16, 17, 18, 19. And therefore,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let us all trust in him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 115. 9, 10, 11. And</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let us all praise him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 118. 2, 3, 4.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The next thing observable in this Protestation, is (if I may so term it) the <hi>Intension</hi> thereof; for we must (as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>arre as lawfully we may) with our lives, power, and estates, perform the things promised, and vowed.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, and Lastly, In this <hi>Protestation,</hi> we must observe, the <hi>Extension,</hi> or <hi>continuance</hi> thereof; for it must be perpetuall, and continue unto our lives end; <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> (the <hi>summe</hi> and <note place="margin">Ierem. 50. 5.</note> 
               <hi>substance</hi> of this <hi>Protestation)</hi> being alwayes, <hi>one,</hi> as was shewed before, in the <hi>fifth Means.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus much for the first main generall, <hi>Viz. What we pray of you;</hi> namely, <hi>That your Honours may be at Unity amongst your selves.</hi> I proceed now unto the second; to wit, <hi>That you may make unity amongst us,</hi> or <hi>make us one.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. Touching <hi>Affection</hi> the case is more plain; for the naturall man sees no <hi>beauty</hi> in Christ, nor <hi>form</hi> to desire him <note n="l" place="margin">Isa. 53. 2.</note>; and <hi>truth</hi> hath no relish with him, <hi>that</hi> being such a <hi>hard saying,</hi> that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not endure it <note n="m" place="margin">Ioh. 6. 60.</note>; yea, all <hi>truths Doctrines</hi> are <hi>bands,</hi> and <hi>bridles,</hi> that enthrall and check our carnall liberty; as for example, The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning of evill words, and of lust, even in the heart <note n="n" place="margin">Matth 12. 36. &amp; 5 18.</note>, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction to confesse our selves nothing <note n="o" place="margin">Rom 7. 18.</note>, and unprofitable ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants <note n="p" place="margin">Luke 17. 10.</note>, and the denyall of the world, which startled and amazed the very Apostles <note n="q" place="margin">Matt. 19. 25.</note>, and makes men go to true Religion, as a Bear to the Stake.</p>
            <p>But now touching <hi>Errors,</hi> it is otherwise: for as <hi>Alcibiades</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered his Pictures, being Owls and Apes, with a Curtain embroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered with Lions and Eagles: and as <hi>Silenus</hi> his Pictures, were without, Lambs and Doves, but within, Tygers and Vultures; so error is gilded, and painted over with such delightfull colours, and so perfumed, as it strongly entangles naturall affections. Such are the Familists wanton communion; the Perfectionists lazy rest from the use of the means, and all Christian War-fare; the Papists pardons for money; and their outward pomp and bravery in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions, Alt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>rs, Shrines, Rood-losts, and other vanities, in the service of their Churches, serving only to allure simple people. Such are also the Mahometists promises of pleasant Gardens, sumptuous and pleasant Palaces, stately Horses, many Wives, &amp;c. in the life to come; to which things mans nature easily listens. And this is the first cause why errour is more readily embraced than the truth. And therefore let your Honors care and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour be, to suppresse all those doctrines and opinions which are pleasing, and sutable to our corrupt natures, but pernicious and finfull for our souls.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another cause hereof, is the manifold wickednesse of mans <note place="margin">Cause 2.</note> corrupted heart, which (as a slime brought in by the inundation of sin) breeds many poysonons Serpents of dissention: As for example,</p>
            <p n="1">1. In some the onely shallow humour of new fanglednesse, like Athenians, ever delighting in Novelties <note n="r" place="margin">Acts 17. 21.</note>. No sooner doth Sathan
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:94346:29"/>
raise a smoke of Novell errors; but these puffs of winde blow a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad the tume thereof into all mens eyes. Never was error de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised, so monstrous against God, or so absurd against common reason, but there were some found who would embrace it. What mad man or Idiot would beleeve, that <hi>Simon</hi> were God, or <hi>Menan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> Christ, or <hi>Montanus</hi> the holy Ghost; or that the Serpent which deceived <hi>Eve</hi> should be worshipped of us (except some papist should parallel it with the Spear which wounded Christ) yet thus <hi>subtill Satban taught, and tbus simple men beleeved</hi> And</p>
            <p n="2">2. In some the vain pride of ambition occasions errors, or a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to be called <hi>Rabbi</hi> 
               <note n="s" place="margin">Matth 23 7.</note>; and with <hi>Diotrephes,</hi> to have the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence <note n="t" place="margin">3 Iohn 9.</note>, and to speak proud and perverse things, and draw Disciples after them <note n="u" place="margin">Acts 20. 30.</note>: These men delight to broach new opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to be holden inventers of new Tenents. So <hi>Theodotus, Proclus,</hi> and others, were followers of <hi>Montanus,</hi> and also the <hi>Cataphrygians;</hi> but they in their singular pride, called their here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies by their own names. <hi>Magno fastu, proprias &amp; a se denominaton haereses condiderunt</hi>

            <p n="3">3. In others, a froward stubborn wilfulnesse occasions the spreading of errors; who will obstinately defend whatsoever hath casually dropt from their pen or tongue. So <hi>Theodotus</hi> (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving for fear of death abjured Christ) defended it afterwards by saying, <hi>He denyed not God, because Christ was not God, but onely Many</hi> 
               <note n="y" place="margin">Epiphan. de haer. Theodot.</note>. And this is one of the papists chief principles, To confesse nothing erroneous, which their Church hath taught at any time. And</p>
            <p n="4">4. In very many the minding of earthly things <note n="z" place="margin">Phil 3 19.</note>, who teach things they ought not, for lucres sake <note n="a" place="margin">Tit. 1. 11.</note>; and serve not the Lord, but make them Gods of their own bellyes <note n="b" place="margin">Rom. 16. 18.

There is a fish in the flood <hi>Aranis,</hi> that at the waxing of the Moon is as white as Snow, at the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning as black as pitch. And there are many who seem very clear in doctrine and opinion, so long as the truth is most promoted and approved by great ones, but muddy and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, when errour is most favoured and advanced.

            <p n="2">2. <hi>Able,</hi> by the perverse crasty wit we have learnt from Sathan, who doth furnish us abundantly with arguments against every truth of God; like to that Sophister, who boasted, <hi>That he had sometimes wanted conclusions to defend, but never arguments to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them withall.</hi> And this brings in the <hi>third cause</hi> of so many dissentions; which is,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the <hi>subtill malice,</hi> and <hi>malicious subtilty</hi> of Sathan; <note place="margin">Cause 3.</note> who, as he is in generall a perpetuall, and indefatigable enimy of Christ, his Church, Religion, and Truth; so in this particular he racks his malicious wit to the highest strain, to <hi>prepare,</hi> and <hi>fit us for errors,</hi> and <hi>errors for us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>He prepares us,</hi> partly by raising doubts in our mindes, which he hath sometimes done in the mainest grounds of Religion (as <hi>Protagoras</hi> saith, it may be doubted, <hi>Dii sint avnon?

Thus he hath taught men to dispute against the Creation of the world of nothing; against the

            <p n="1">1. By seasoning them to our tastes; by observing our severall dispositions, and fitting us with agreeable suggestions.

            <p n="2">2. He prepares errours for us, by glazing, and polishing them over, that they may the more smoothly deceive. And herein he hath plaid his Master-prize.

delightfull vanities, in the mean time assaulting faith (as perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance of the Saints, the All-sufficiency of the written Word, and heavenly nature of saith, &amp;c.) and labouring to draw us back into some antiquated and demolished vanities, of old used by the papists, and disused in reformed Churches, as Altars, Cross s, Tapers, Images, Pictures in walls, windows, garments, and the like; because these being once admitted, will serve, as so many graduall Steps, to re-advance that Babylonish Strumpet, to that Seat of Supreme and Spirituall Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, from whence by our fore-fathers, she was iustly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted.</p>
            <p>These three mentioned, are main causes which fill the world with dissentions. For errors are a pleasing bait, our wanton ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite greedily embracing them, and the devil, as a skilfull Angler, baits his hook of dissention with them; that we may say as <hi>Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninus</hi> once said, <hi>Vah Domine quis evadere queat, O Lord, who can escape?</hi> But</p>
            <p>Fourthly, there is another over-swaying cause, of more power <note place="margin">Cause 4.</note> than any (yea all) of these; and that is, The fearfull wrath of our God, delivering up those people to blindenesse and errour, whose sinnes he findes ripe unto harvest.

            <p>Thus your Honours have seen the causes of these differences, dissentions, and rents which are amongst us: and it may now be expected, that I should shew the remedies against those cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; but I omit it.</p>
            <p>Partly, because I have amply shewed the duty both of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates and people, for the averting of spirituall as well as tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall plagues from Church and State, in my <hi>Pious mans practice in Parliament time.</hi> And</p>

               <hi>hold according to the written word;</hi> yet this will not satisfie the doubt amongst our selves; considering the manifold <hi>Tares</hi> of different opinions, which Satan hath laboured to sow even in the midst of our Reformed Churches, yea in the midst of our own Church of England: (I might here instance in Lutherans, and Zwinglians; in non-conformists, and conformitans; in Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists, and Remonstrants, and Socinians, &amp;c.) What shall we then say to this? Shall we take upon us to determine which are true Tenents, and which erroneous? It were too great a pride to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine all differing learned men to my poor opinion (lest they should say unto me, <hi>When went the Spirit of the Lord from me, to speak unto thee</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">1 Kin. 23. 24.

            <p n="1">1. Take heed of innovating in Religion. Innovation hath bin <note place="margin">Rule 1.</note> ever held so dangerous, that the fear thereof brought our pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent State to a pawse, even in the holy work of Reformation; as a Prelate of our own witnessed <note n="b" place="margin">Tantae molis crat Romanum tollere ritum. <hi>Archb.</hi> Hutton.</note>; and therefore let that abide in us, which we have had from the beginning <note n="c" place="margin">1. Ioh. 2. 14.</note>; and let us keep the profession of our hope without wavering <note n="d" place="margin">Heb. 10.</note>; taking especiall heed of relapsing, and falling back again (with the dog to his vomit, and the sow to the mire <note n="e" place="margin">2 Pet. 2. 20.</note>) into any forsaken and demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished erroneous opinions, or superstitions of Popery. Our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers (in the times of Reformation) taught us the certainty of our salvation, the perseverance of the Saints, the sweet doctrine of Predestination, the heavenly gift of Faith, the free grace of salvation, and to prefer (in the service of God) the inward wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of the Spirit, before unmeasurable outward pomp, or any lip-labour, or bare outward performance. Yea, these doctrines have been sealed unto us, by the blood of many holy Martyrs, (Bishop <hi>Cranmer, Latimer, Ridley, Hooper, Farrer,</hi> &amp;c.) and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued and confirmed by the unanimous teaching of many fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously learned (unparalleld <hi>Juell, Morton, Davenant, Fulke, W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Wherefore let not us leave these doctrines, and lean unto the contrary, maintained by Papists, Pelagians, Remonstrants, and their abettors: but let us hold fast, and keep to the instructions which we have been taught (2. Thessal. 2. 15.) let us not waver, nor be carried about with every blast of windy doctrine <note n="g" place="margin">Eph. 4. 14.</note>; but hold fast what we have learnt, that no man may take away our Crown <note n="h" place="margin">Rev. 3. 11.</note>, lest if we re-edifie, or re-admit what hath been banished, Sathan will not come alone, but bring in with him seven Spirits worse then himself <note n="i" place="margin">Matth. 12. 47.</note>.</p>
            <p>Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> tells us of a man that fell into a ditch, and his friend coming by, and being desired by him to help him forth, he began to question with him, How he fell in? If he were drunk when he fell? or, If it were dark? How long he had been in? If none at all had come by since he fell in? and the like demands. Oh (saith he) help me forth from hence, and do not enquire how I came hither. If a man see his house on fire, he doth not first enquire, How it came? In what room it began? What damage it hath already done? By whose negligence it was? Whether it was done wilfully, or carelesly? But he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours by all means, with all speed to quench it. Give me leave, my Lords, for the conclusion of this first Rule to apply these passages. Every seeing eye, and marking man, observes how our Church and Religion is on fire; and how the very main pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars thereof are in perill utterly to perish: for these doctrines have been miserably shaken, burnt, battered, defac't, and opposed. <hi>viz.</hi> The pers<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

unto us, in calling your Honours to help us, we might ere long have taken up the Fathers complaint, with some mutation, <hi>That all England is become an Arminian.</hi> Now I know your Honors, in your grave wisedome, and great care of us, will not so much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, Who first broached these opinions amongst us? Who first gave life unto them, and who nourishment? Who fomented, and who favoured them? who preached them, and who promoted the Preachers of them? (although all these be worth enquiry, that the instruments of our mischief may be found out:) as study how to suppresse and expell these doctrines and Doctors from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us for the present, and make provision against them for the time to come. And thus much shall suffice for the first Rule.</p>
            <p n="2">2.

            <p>Thirdly, give not too much place to curious questions, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations, <note place="margin">Rule 3.</note> especially touching the Works of God. A simple man may knit more knots in an hour, than many learned men can un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loose in a long time. It is easier to raise many such spirits, than to lay or conjure down a few of them. To confesse a truth, we shall finde some so strongly armed with seeming weight of reason or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, that it will even confound mans wit and understanding to avoid them; and they must, indeed, be assoiled onely by faith, as was said before. I will recite some few such questions, not that we should discusse them, but (as the Lacedemonians shewed drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards to their children) that we should abhor to dispute them.</p>
            <p>One disputes thus, Either God did not reveal to the good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels their future perseverance (and then, how were they happy?) or he did it to them, but not to the rest, which after fell; and then how was he equall to all? <hi>Si sancti Angeli aeterne su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Also, Why Infants should be damned, through the negligence of other men <note n="b" place="margin">Ib. lib. 10. c. 15.</note>? Also he thinks it cannot by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures be proved (which yet is holden for a certain truth) That
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:94346:33"/>
mans soul is derived from God, and not from the parents <note n="a" place="margin">Ib. lib. 10. cap. 15.</note>. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other cannot conceive, How the Word could be made flesh <note n="b" place="margin">Chrys<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>Now my Lords, lest these should be imputed as faults to those holy Fathers; Let me acquaint your Honours with their pious, and reverend answers. It is true, Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> struggles (like a man embogged in the depth of Gods judgements) to finde a reason, <hi>Why Infants are damned?</hi> Either from Gods fore know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, how they would have sinned if they had lived; or from some other hidden cause <note n="d" place="margin">August. de Gen. adl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>. lib. 10. cap. 15.</note>. And <hi>Fr. Maro</hi> elsewhere, would excuse him, to speak only by way of argument, not of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>Hic loquitur, non determinando, sed arguendo</hi>

But the blessed Father rests not in these, but confesseth plainly, That he cannot pierce into the depth of Gods counsels, they being farre above his reach <note n="f" place="margin">Gen. 14 4.</note>; and he thinks above all humane judgement <note n="g" place="margin">Ib. 10. 15.</note>. And <hi>Chrysostome</hi> forbids us to search such things <note n="h" place="margin">Chrys. S. Ioh. 1. hom. 10.</note>, professing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and all creatures to be ignorant thereof. These are pious confessions, learned ignorance, humble sincerity, bright shining faith, and heavenly spirits; and we should learn of them, to confesse our blindnesse, and to submit our understanding in faith, to the wisedome of God. <hi>Nisi ardore disputationum ingenia incale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scerent, ad multa possemus piè respondere, Deus novit. Aretius.</hi> If heat of argument did not inflame us, we might piously answer to many questions of this nature, God knows how, though we know not. And therefore seeing these Questions, and Disputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons concerning the <hi>Will, Works,</hi> and <hi>Attributes</hi> of <hi>God</hi> aré so dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, derogatory, and unwarrantable; Let your Honours care be to take some Religious and pious course, for the stinting, and restraining of them; and the extinguishing of this fire of Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianisme, which gives heat, life, and growth unto them.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Let us never leave our own <hi>colours,</hi> to pafse into <note place="margin">Rule 4.</note> the <hi>Pavilions</hi> of the <hi>Papists.</hi> This is done,</p>
            <p>Partly by siding with them in opinions, touched in the first Rule. And</p>

            <p>Fifthly, let your Honours be wel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ilded unto, from thence they will induce others; and so (like cunning Faulkoners, holding fast what they get) by constant prosecuting of advantages gotten, take in all our forces, by insensible degrees one after another. For false Apostles are deceitfull workers <note n="i" place="margin">2 Cor. 11. 13.</note>, and like Serpents if they can wring in, but the tip of their tails, will slyly insinuate the whole bodies of their errours into our affections. Let us therefore beware how we open unto them, any postern of belief, left before we be aware, we (to our own unspeakable danger) admit all their forces, and so suffer them to quarter their whole squad ons in our hearts. I will only instance in one sort of false Teachers. It appears as clear, as the Sunne at high noon, by that learned work e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And therefore, let your Honours (we humbly beseech you) joyn all your strength, to quench this sire of Pelagianisme, that hath so long burned, and e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

To be of one opinion, and to hold fast that U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Doctrine, which is according to the truth of the Gospel, as also to establish and settle it amongst others, is a fruit that the Garden of Nature affords not, but must be transplanted from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and grafted in us by the Spirit of our God, <hi>from whom every good gift doth proceed and flow.</hi>
