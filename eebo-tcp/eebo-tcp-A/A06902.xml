         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE ART OF
ARCHERIE.</head>
            <head>CHAP. 1. A Generall Encomium, or praise
of Shooting, both in Peace and
Warre.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Hooting is an Art
necessary for the
Knowledge of all
sorts of Men, vse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
both in Peace
and Warre; It is
an honest pastime
for the minde, and an wholesome
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:12226:13"/>
exercise for the Body; Not vilde
for Great-men to vse, nor costly for
Poore-men to maintayne, not lur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
in holes and corners, for ill
men at their pleasure to misuse
it, but still abiding in the open sight
and face of the world, for good
men (if it bee any way faulty) by
their wisedome to correct it.</p>
            <p>Now touching the Antiquity of
it, <hi>Claudian</hi> saith; That Nature first
gaue the example of <hi>shooting</hi> by the
<hi>Porpentine,</hi> which by shooting his
Quils will hit any thing that fights
with it, which Learned men after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
imitated in finding out <hi>Bow</hi>
and <hi>shafts: Plinie</hi> referreth it to
<hi>Scythes,</hi> the sonne of <hi>Iupiter.</hi> Better
and nobler Writers, as <hi>Plato, Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machus,</hi>
and <hi>Galen,</hi> bring Shooting
from <hi>Apollo,</hi> when hee flew <hi>Python;</hi>
yet long before those dayes, wee
reade expresly in the Bible of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:12226:13"/>
Shooting, and if wee shall beleeue
<hi>Lira, Lamech</hi> killed <hi>Caine</hi> with a
Shaft, which long continuance
doth not a little praise the Art, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
that it hath at all times and
may still bee vsed by all men, the
examples of the Antients are
proofes vnresistable; <hi>Cyaxares</hi>
King of the <hi>Medes</hi> and great Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father
to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> kept a company of
<hi>Scythians</hi> with him onely to teach
his Sonne <hi>Astiages</hi> to shoote, and
<hi>Cyrus,</hi> being a Child, as <hi>Zenophon</hi>
sheweth, was himselfe taught the
Art of Shooting; <hi>Darius</hi> was so
exquisite in this Art, that hee cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
this Inscription to be grauen on
his Monument:
<q>
                  <l>
                     <hi>DARIVS</hi> the King
lyes buried heere;</l>
                  <l>That in Shooting and Riding
had no peere.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:12226:14"/>
               <hi>Domitian</hi> the Emperour was so
cunning in Shooting, that he would
shoote betwixt a mans fingers stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
a farre off and neuer hurt him.
<hi>Comodus</hi> also had so sure an hand,
that there was nothing within his
reach and shoote but hee could hit
it in what place he listed: <hi>Themi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stius</hi>
the Phylosopher commended
<hi>Theodosius</hi> the Emperour, for three
things which hee vsed of a Child,
which were <hi>Shooting, Riding,</hi> and
<hi>Feates of Armes:</hi> And not onely
Kings and Emperours haue beene
brought vp in Shooting, but also
the best Common-wealths haue
made excellent Edicts to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
it. The <hi>Persians</hi> (which vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>Cyrus</hi> conquered in a manner
all the world) made a Law, that
their Children from Fiue yeares
old vnto Twenty, should learne
three onely things, that was; To
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:12226:14"/>
               <hi>Ride,</hi> to <hi>Shoote,</hi> and to <hi>Speake Truth
alwayes;</hi> The <hi>Romans</hi> had a Law,
that euery man should vse Shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in the time of Peace, till hee
was Forty yeares old, and that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
House should haue a Bow and
forty Shafts ready for all occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
If I should rehearse the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
made in Parliament by the
Kings of <hi>England</hi> for the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Shooting, I should but
tyre patience, let these therefore
suffice already rehearsed; And
how fit labour is for Youth, <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos</hi>
among the <hi>Grecians,</hi> and <hi>Licur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi>
among the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> doe
shew, who neuer ordayned any
thing for the bringing vp of Youth
that was not joyned with labour;
and that labour which is in Shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
is of all other the best; both
because it increaseth Strength, and
most preserueth Health, being not
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:12226:15"/>
vehement but moderate, not ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laying
any one part with weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
but exercising euery part with
equalnesse, as the Arme and Brest
with drawing, the other parts with
walking, being not so painefull for
the labour as delightfull for the
pastime, which Exercise by the
Iudgement of the best Physitians
is most allowable. Also by Shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
the mind is honestly imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
where a man doth alwayes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to doe best, (which is a word
of honesty) and by the same way
that Vertue it selfe doth, coueting
to come nighest a most perfect end
or meane, standing betweene two
extreames, eschewing <hi>Short,</hi> or;
<hi>Gone,</hi> or on eyther side <hi>Wide;</hi>
which caused <hi>Aristotle</hi> to say, that
<hi>Shooting</hi> and <hi>Vertue,</hi> were like
one another, and that Shooting of
all other Recreations was the most
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:12226:15"/>
honest, and gaue least occasion to
haue Naughtinesse joyned vnto it,
which two things, doe approue,
that (as Tutors or Overseers) are
fixed vnto it, and that is, <hi>Day-light</hi>
and <hi>Open-place</hi> where euery man
doth come, the keepers from all
vnhonest Actions. If a man shoot
foule at any time, it is not hid, it
lurkes not in corners, but openly
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ccuseth and bewrayeth it selfe,
which (as wise men say) is the
next way to amendment.</p>
            <p>Now as Shooting is thus excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
in it selfe, and most allowable
by both Antient and Moderne
Authority and example in the time
of Peace; So it is much more illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious,
and by many degrees more
profitable and with more vigour
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o bee acquired in the time of
Warre—as thus,—</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:12226:16"/>The vpper-hand in Warre, next
to the goodnesse of God (from
whom all Victory commeth) stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
chiefly in three things; The
<hi>Wisdome of the Prince,</hi> the <hi>Slights and
Policies of the Commanders,</hi> and the
<hi>Strength and cheerefull forwardnes of
the Soldiers:</hi> The 2. first I will omit
(they are Elements aboue mee) the
last, which is the strength of warre,
it abideth in the Souldier, whose
chiefe praise and vertue is <hi>Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>
to his Superiours, then to
haue and handle his Weapon well;
of which, the one must bee at the
Captaines appointment, the other,
lyeth in the Courage and exercise
of the Souldier; yet of all Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons,
the best is that, where with
least danger to our selues, wee may
hurt our Enemies most; And that
is, (as I suppose) by Artillerie,
which now adayes is taken for
<hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nnesu</hi> and <hi>Bowes,</hi> which how
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:12226:16"/>
much they doe in Warre, both dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
experience doth teach, and <hi>Peter
Nannius</hi> of <hi>Lovayne</hi> doth very well
set out in a Dialogue, wherein this
is remarkable, that when hee hath
shewed all the excellent commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of both, and some discommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
of Gunnes, as infinite cost,
and charge, cumbersome carriage;
And if they bee great, the vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
leuelling, the perill of them
that stand by them, the easier avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
by them that are farre of. And
if they be little, the lesse both feare
and jeopardy is in them, besides all
contrary winds and weather which
doth hinder them not a litle; yet of
all, in <hi>Shooting</hi> hee cannot rehearse
any discommody; yea, so necessary
hath Shooting been, and so highly
set by, that to its lasting credit it is
recorded, that when <hi>Hector</hi> and his
<hi>Troians,</hi> would haue set fire on the
<hi>Greeke</hi> ships, <hi>Teucer</hi> with his Bow
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:12226:17"/>
made them recoile backe againe,
And <hi>Troy</hi> it selfe could neuer be
destroyed without the helpe of
<hi>Hercules</hi> Shafts, which thing doth
signifie, that though all the world
were gathered into one Army, yet
without Shooting they can neuer
come to their purpose, and this
may partly be collected out of the
holy Scriptures, where it is recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that among the <hi>Iewes,</hi> nothing
was so frequent or did so much
good as Bowes; insomuch,<note place="margin">Iosh. 13.</note> that
whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the <hi>Iewes</hi> had any great victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ouer the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> the first thing
that the Captaines did, was to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort
the people to giue all the
thankes to God for the conquest,
and not to their Bowes wherewith
they had slaine their enemies. God
when he promiseth helpe to the
<hi>Iewes</hi> vseth no kind of speaking so
much as this; <hi>That he will bend his
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:12226:17"/>
Bow, and die his Shafts in the Gentiles
blood;</hi> whereby it is manifest, that
God will either make the <hi>Iewes</hi> to
shoot strong shootes to ouerthrow
their enemies, or at least, that Shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
is a mighty powerfull thing in
warre, wherevnto the high power
of God is likened; <hi>David</hi> in the
<hi>Psalmes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 7. 63. 74.</note>, calleth Bowes, <hi>The vessels
of Death, A Bitter thing, a mighty
Power,</hi> with like Attributes; yet one
place more I must remember for
the praise of Shooting; and that is,
when <hi>Saul</hi> was slayne by the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listines</hi>
(beeing mighty Bow-men)
and <hi>Ionathan</hi> his Sonne, who was
so good an Archer, that he never
shot shaft in vayne; the first Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
<hi>David</hi> made, after hee came to
the Kingdome; was, that all <hi>Israel
should learne to shoot:</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Sam<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1. 18.</note> by which wee
see what great use and Provision,
even from the beginning, was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:12226:18"/>
the <hi>Iewes</hi> for Shooting. <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostris</hi>
the most potent King that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
was in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> overcame a
great part of the World, onely by
<hi>Archers,</hi> and in token how he van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished
all men, he set up in many
places great Images to his owne
likenesse, with a Bow in one hand,
and a sharpe headed-Arrow in the
other. The Prince of <hi>Samos, Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi>
was Lord over the <hi>Greeke</hi>
Seas, and withstood the power of
the <hi>Persians,</hi> onely by the helpe of
one thousand Archers. The best
part of <hi>Alexanders</hi> armie were Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,
as <hi>Appian</hi> and others record,
and they so strong, that sundry
times they overcame their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
before any other weapon
could come in to second them. But
to let passe these foreine examples,
I will conclude with this saying
out of <hi>Pliny; If any man would call
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:12226:18"/>
to mind the Aethiopians, Aegyptians,
Arabians, Indians, Scythians, Sarma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi>
and <hi>Parthians, hee shall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
halfe the World to live in Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection,
overcome by the power and
might of Shooting.</hi> Againe, <hi>Leo</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
concerning what Armes were
best, sayth thus; <hi>Let all the youth of
Rome be compelled to vse shooting, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
more or lesse, and ever to carry
their Bowe and Quiver about them,
untill they bee forty yeares old.</hi> And
in another place, he sayth; <hi>Let the
Souldiers have their weapons well
appointed, but above all other things
regard most Shooting; especially in the
time of peace, for the neglect of it one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
hath brought the whole Empire of
Rome to Ruine.</hi> And againe, he saith
thus to his Generall; <hi>Arme your
Hoast as I have appointed you, but es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
with Bowes and Arrowes, for
the power of it is infinite.</hi> And againe
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:12226:19"/>
to the same Generall, thus; <hi>Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerie
is easie to bee prepared, and in
time of need a thing most profitable,
therefore wee straightly command you
to make Proclamation to all men under
our Dominions, which bee eyther in
Warre or Peace, to all Cities, Boroughs
and Townes, and finally to all manner
of men, that every severall person
have Bowe and Shafts of his owne,
and every house (besides this,) to have a
standing, bearing Bow and 40. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes
for all needs, and that they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
themselues, in Holts, Hills, and
Dales, Playnes and Woods, for all
manner of chances which may happen
in Warre.</hi> Which Law of this good
Emperour, if it were in force in
<hi>England,</hi> those which now haunt
<hi>Play-houses, Ale-houses</hi> and <hi>Tobacco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,</hi>
I would presume, by little
and little, bee brought to a better
esteeme of themselves and a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:12226:19"/>
loathing of those ill places. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
to conclude with our owne
Nation; what Battayle haue wee
ever fought eyther at home or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
and tryumphed, but the
Bow (next unto God) hath carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the honor, witnesse the famous
Battaile of <hi>Cressie</hi> against <hi>Philip</hi> the
<hi>French</hi> King, where (as our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries
themselves doe confesse)
was slain all the <hi>Nobility</hi> of <hi>France,</hi>
onely by the <hi>English</hi> Archers: like
unto this, was the Battaile fought
by the Blacke Prince beside <hi>Poyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers,</hi>
where <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King,
with his Sonne, and in a manner
all the Peeres of <hi>France</hi> were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
besides 30000. which that
day were slaine, and very few Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishmen.
As this, so the Battayle
of <hi>Agincourt,</hi> is remarkeable, where
<hi>Henry</hi> the fifth, with 7000. figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
men, and many of them sicke
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:12226:20"/>
and vnable, yet such Archers, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
(as the Chronicle doth report)
most of them drew a yard, slew all
the Chevalrie of <hi>France,</hi> to the
number of 40000. and more, and
lost not above 26. of the <hi>English.</hi>
The bloody Civill Warre betwixt
the two great houses of <hi>Yorke</hi> and
<hi>Lancaster,</hi> where Arrowes flew on
every side, will witnesse the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfulnesse
of the Bow, and as these,
so a world of others, too tedious
to recite. So that in conclusion, it
cannot be denyed, but the Bowe
hath done more wonderfull ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployts
and brought home more
Tryumphs, then any other weapon
that ever was read of, cyther in
<hi>Greeke</hi> or <hi>Latine</hi> Story, then that
it should now fall sicke, languish,
nay dye, and be buried in perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
oblivion, <hi>O quam te memorem.</hi>

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:12226:24"/>
from such proceedings. First, a
Glory to the Band by augmenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their numbers, an expertnes
in the Souldier, by his acquaintince
withall manner of weapons, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
dexteritie of Body, by the vse and
knowledge of euery Military mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
For, allow the Bow to be as
despised a thing as either Envie or
Ignorance would haue it, yet out
of this discipline the Bowman shal
learne these most necessary les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons:
First, all manner of Marches
&amp; Countermarches, Turnings &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnings;
Wheelings imbattailings,
doublings, and deductings, distance
of place, how to Charge, Retyre,
and how to giue showers or vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys
vpon all occasions, the post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure
of the Bow and Arrow, which
hath affinitie with the Musquer, and
the postures of the Palizadoe,
which is a good conduct to the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:12226:24"/>
Pike, he shall learne the beatings of
the Drum, all words of Command,
the power of his superior Officers,
and indeed what not, that belongs
to an ordinarie Souldier; So that
when any of them shall be called
into the trayned Band to handle
other weapons, they will be found
so skilfull and expert, that there
can be no feare either of Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
or disorder, and where his
Maiesty hath one souldier now, he
will then haue two or a greater
Number.</p>
            <p>Now if I shall be questioned
touching the mixture of these seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
weapons, the <hi>Pike,</hi> the <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet,</hi>
and the <hi>Bow,</hi> or in what sort
they may be imbattayled without
disorder or hinderance of one
weapon with another; I answer,
that albe there are a world of more
worthy Souldiers which can bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:12226:25"/>
demonstrate these things then
my selfe, yet this is mine Opinion,
and thus I conceiue it may be done
both easily and profitably. In the
dayes of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of thrice
happy and blessed memory, when
the vse of the <hi>Musquet</hi> was newly
brought from beyond the Seas in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this Kingdome, and the vertue
thereof found and approued; yet
was the weapon so scarce to be had,
workemen so slow, and new altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
so vnpleasant, that the State
was compelled to compound their
Bands of three seuerall weapons,
the <hi>Pike, Musquet,</hi> and the <hi>Harque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bush,</hi>
or <hi>Calliuer,</hi> as I am able to
shew by sundry lists, both of mine
owne and others. But after the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of some small time, by
the care of the <hi>Lords Liuetenants,</hi> and
the diligence of their <hi>Deputies,</hi> the
Bands were reduced into that estate
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:12226:25"/>
wherein now they stand, which is,
<hi>Pike,</hi> and <hi>Musquet</hi> only, and the <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebush</hi>
cast off. Now instead of the
<hi>Harquebush,</hi> and as the <hi>Harquebush,</hi>
so would I haue the Bow imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and as the Musquet doth wing
the Pike; So I would haue the
Bow to wing the Musquet, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing
to keepe the numbers so
iust and constant, that one weapon
might not intermixe with another,
but as three distinct and seueral bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
(howeuer joyned in one Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talia)
to be separated and disposed
at the pleasure of the Commander;
and because the <hi>Bow</hi> is a more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and quicker Weapon of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
then the <hi>Musquet,</hi> the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
may by doubling and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubling,
eyther Ranks or Fyles,
make his showers of arrowes grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
or lesse, according to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage
of ground, the strength of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:12226:26"/>
his numbers, or the approach of
the Enemie.</p>
            <p>Many other things might be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to this little beginning, which
were much to tedious to handle in
this place; because, I onely desire
but to open a little narrow way to
a great deale of profit for the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
which if it shall please Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
to accept and second, both
my selfe and many others, much
more worthy then my selfe, will
bee ready with our vttermost
endeauours to make good this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect;
Besides, the now almost halfe
lost Societies of <hi>Bowyers</hi> and <hi>Flet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,</hi>
will get a little warmth and,
both praise their God, and pray for
theyr King, from whom these good
things issue. Not that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
or Souldiers shall bee forc'd to
any new charge or cost, by which
extraordinary gaine may redound
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:12226:26"/>
vnto them, but that the wholsome
Lawes of the Kingdome (which
bindeth euery man to be master of
a Bow and Arrowes) may be a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
awakened. And so I returne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
to the Art of <hi>Archerie,</hi> and
the true knowledge with vse of
the Bow and Arrow, and all things
else depending vpon them.</p>

two things; first, Shooting
<hi>streight</hi> then keeping a <hi>length,</hi> and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:12226:27"/>
these are attained vnto, by knowing
and hauing all things belonging to
Shooting, &amp; when they be knowne
and had, then in the well handling
of them; and of these, some belong
to shooting straight, some to kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping

hereafter.</p>
            <p>Now touching the things belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging

that all things are outward,
yet some be outward Instruments
for euery seuerall Archer to bring

other things be generall to euery
man, as the time and place serueth.</p>
            <p>Those which I call outward In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments,

            <p>THe <hi>Bracer</hi> giueth the least

it is an Instrument of
no potent validitie, yet such an
one as may not be omitted; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you shall vnderstand, that the
<hi>Bracer</hi> serueth for two purposes,
the one to saue the arme from the
stripe of the String, and his dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blet
from wearing; and the other,
that the String glyding sharply and
quickly of the Bracer may make
the sharper shoote, for if the string
should light vpon the bare sleeue,
the strength of the shoote would
stop and dye there; yet it is the
best in my Indgement, to giue the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:12226:29"/>
Bow so much Bent, that the string

good Archers which seldome
or neuer vse them, but it is not a
Rule for generall Imitation; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
euery mans apparell is not of
one fashion, nor euery one that
fulnesse of Iudgement, that those
which are continually and dayly
exercised in the same haue.</p>
            <p>In a <hi>Bracer,</hi> a man must take heed
of three things; First, that it haue
no Nayles in it, then that it haue
no Buckles; and lastly, that the laces
wherewith it is fastned be without
Tags or Aglets; For the Nayles
will sheare the string in sunder be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a man be aware, and so put his
Bow into hazard, and the Buckles,
Tags or Aglets, will (when a man
least suspects it) raze and scratch
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:12226:30"/>
his Bow, a thing both vncomely to
behold, and dangerous for the
weapon.</p>
            <p>These <hi>Bracers</hi> are made for the
most part of Spanish-leather, the
smooth-side outward, and they be
the best, sometimes of Spanish-lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and the flesh side outward, and
they are both good and tollerable,
and others are made of hard, stiffe
but smooth Bend-leather, and they
be the worst and most dangerous,
And thus much is spoken of the

            <head>CAHP. V. Of the Shooting-glove and the vse
thereof.</head>
            <p>A <hi>Shooting-gloue</hi> is a necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
armour or defence for
the hand, to preserue it
from hurting or galling, so that a
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:12226:30"/>
man may be able in his fingers to
beare the sharpnesse of the String
to the vttermost of his strength,
for when a man shooteth, the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
and might of his Shoot lyeth
in the foremost finger, and the Ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finger;
for the middle finger (which
is the longest) like a Coward starts
backe and beareth no weight of the
String, in a manner at all; therefore,
the two other fingers must haue
thicker leather, and that must haue
the thickest of all, whereon a man
looseth most, and for sure loosing,
the foremost finger is most apt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it holdeth best, and for that
purpose, Nature hath yoaked it
with the Thumbe. Leather, if it be
next a mans skin will sweate, wax
hard and chafe; therefore, Scarlet
for the softnesse, thicknesse and
wholesomnesse, is best to line the
Gloue withall; but, if you finde
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:12226:31"/>
that it helpeth not, but still the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
hurteth, it is good then to take
a Searecloth made of fine Virgin
waxe and Deere Suet, and put<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ting
it next your hand draw on
your Gloue; If yet you feele
your finger pinched, then for
beare Shooting, both because
it is not possible for you to shoote
well, as also, the continuall hurting
of your Fingers by slow degrees,
will make the time long ere you
can be able to shoote againe.</p>
            <p>A new Gloue pluckes many
Shoots, because the String goeth
not freely off, &amp; therfore the fingers
of the Gloue must be cut short, and
trimmed with some sweete oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that the String may glide
smoothly away.</p>
            <p>There be some, that with hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the nocke of their Shaft too
hard, rub the skin off their fingers,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:12226:31"/>
which is an errour, yet there is for
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t two remedies, one to haue Goose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quils
spinetted and sewed against
the Nocking, betwixt the lyning
of the Gloue and the Leather, which
both openeth the fingers and helps
the Shoote. The other, is to haue a
rowle of leather sewed betwixt
his fingers at the setting on of the
finger-stals, which will so keepe
his fingers asunder, that by no
meanes he shall hold the nocke so
hard, as before he did.</p>
            <p>This Shooting-gloue, should al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
haue a purse on the backe of the
hand, wherein the Archer shall euer
carrie a fine linnen cloth and waxe,
two necessary things, for any man
that vseth shooting; Some men vse
Gloues or the like on the Bow
hand, for feare of chafing; because
they hold so hard. But that er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
happeneth (for the most part)
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:12226:32"/>
when a Bow is not round, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
little square, therefore fine tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
waxe shall doe well in such a
case, to lay where a man holdeth
his Bow; yet I doe not condemne
the wearing of a fine thin cut fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard-gloue
on the Bow hand. And
thus much concerning the Shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting-gloue;
which albe, they are but
trifles in a generall opinion, yet to
the young vnexperienced Scholler
they are things of moment, and as
well worthy his knowledge as
those of greater value.</p>

            <p>THe <hi>Bow-String</hi> though it be
but a little thing to the eye,
and but a small twine in
the hand, yet it is a thing of high
esteeme and worthy of a mans best
circumspection, onely the infelici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
is, that in this Instrument a man
is forc'd to put all his confidence
in the honesty of the String-maker,
and surely, the String-maker ought
more diligently to be looked vnto
by appoynted officers, then eyther
<hi>Bowyer</hi> or <hi>Fletcher;</hi> because they
may deceiue a simple man with
more ease. An euill String brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
many a good Bow, yea no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing halfe so many; In warre
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:12226:33"/>
if a string breake, the man is lost
and is no man, for his weapon is
gone; and though he haue two
strings put on at once, yet he shall
haue small leasure and lesse roome
to bend his bow; and therefore,
God send honest String-makers
both for Peace and Warre.</p>
            <p>Touching what a String ought
to be made on, as whether of good
hempe (according to our now mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne
practise) or of fine Flaxe or
Silke, I leaue it to the decyssion of
the String-maker, of whom we must
buy them who are most conuersant
with the vertues of euery seuerall
substance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eustathius</hi> vpon this verse in
<hi>Homer</hi>—
<q>Twang quoth the Bow, and twang
quoth the String, out quickly
the Shaft flew—</q>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:12226:33"/>
doth tell, that in old time, they
made theyr Bow-strings of Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lockes
Tharmes, or Guts, which
they twyned together as they doe
Ropes, or as they doe great Harp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strings,
or other like strings for
great Instruments, which occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
them to giue a great twang.</p>
            <p>Bow-strings also haue beene
made of the haire of an Horsetaile,
and were called by reason of the
substance wher of they were made,
<hi>Hippias,</hi> as appeareth in many good
Authors; Great Strings and little
Strings be for diuers purposes, the
great string is more sure for the
Bow, more stable to pricke with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
but flower for the cast; the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
string is cleane contrary, not so
sure, &amp; therfore to be taken heed of,
least with long tarying on it break
your Bow, beeing more fit to
shoot farre, then apt to prick neare;
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:12226:34"/>
therfore when you know the nature
of both big and little, you may fit
your Bow according to your oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions.</p>
            <p>In the stringing of your Bow,
though this theame belong rather
to the handling then to the thing it
selfe; yet because the thing and the
handling of the thing, be so joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
together; I must needs some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
couple the one with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</p>
            <p>First therefore, in the <hi>Stringing</hi>
of your <hi>Bow,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The strin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the Bow.</note> you must marke the
fit length of your Bow; for if the
string be too short, the bending
will giue, and at the last slippe, and
so put the Bow in hazard; if it be
too long, the bending must needes
be in the small of the String, which
being twyned hard, must needs
knap in sunder, which is the vtter
destruction of many a good Bow,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:12226:34"/>
moreouer, you must look that your
Bow be well Nocked, for feare the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>harpnesse of the Horne sheare in
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>under the String, which chanceth
often, when in bending, the string
hath but one wap to strengthen it
withall; you must looke also, that
your string bee streight and euen
put on; otherwise, one end will
writhe contrary to the other, and so
in danger the Bow. When the string
beginneth neuer so little to weare,
trust it not, but away with it, for
it is an euill saued peny that loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
a man a Crowne.</p>
            <p>Thus you see, how many jeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardies
hang ouer the poore Bow,
by reason onely of the String, as
when it is eyther too short, or too
long, when the Nocke is naught,
when the string hath but one wap,
or when it tarrieth too long on the
Bow; yet these, are not all the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:12226:35"/>
reasons for the breaking of the
Bow, for it is broken diuers other
wayes, and by diuers other meanes,
as shall be declared.</p>
            <p>In stringing your Bow, you must
haue respect to much Bend and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
bend, for they be cleane contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one to the other. The little
Bend hath but one commodity,
which is in shooting faster and far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the reason being, because the
String hath so farre a passage ere it
part with the Shaft. The great
Bend hath many commodities, for
it maketh easier shooting, the Bow
being halfe drawne before; It nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
no Bracer, for the string stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth
before it come to the Arme,
it will not so soone hit a mans
Sleeue, or other parts of his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
it hurteth not the Feathers
of the shaft as the low Bend doth,
it also suffereth a man the better to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:12226:35"/>
espie his Mark<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>; Therefore let
your Bow haue a reasonable good
Bend, as about a Shaftment and
more at the least, for the reasons
before rehearsed.</p>
            <p>Lastly, it is not amisse, if in the
mid-part of the String, just where
you Nocke your Arrow, you
warpe it about for the space of
foure fingers, with fine Silke well
waxed, for it will both be a good
defence for the String to keepe it
from wearing, and also fill the
Nocke of the Arrow the better,
and make it flye with more certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
And thus much of the <hi>Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string.</hi>

the chiefest Instrument in

at diuers times, haue vsed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
Bowes and of divers fashions.
<hi>Horne-bowes</hi> are vsed in some pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
at this day, and were much v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in the dayes of <hi>Homer;</hi> for <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darus,</hi>
who was one of the best
Shooters amongst the <hi>Troians,</hi> had

saith <hi>Homer,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iliad. 4.</note> was, Sixteen hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bredth,
not much differing from
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:12226:36"/>
the length of our Bowes. The
Scriptures make mention of <hi>Brasse-bowes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 17.</note> 
               <hi>Iron-bowes,</hi> &amp; <hi>Steele-bowes,</hi> all
which were vsed of long time, and
are yet at this day among the <hi>Turks;</hi>

for it Brasse, Iron, or Steele,
haue their owne strength and vigor

and their Strength nothing worth,
to shoot any strong shoot withall.</p>

stroake that no Armour or Shield,
though it were neuer so strong was
able to withstand it, the length of
such a Bow was euen with the
length of him that vsed it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Licians</hi> vsed Bowes made
of a certaine Tree called in Latine
<hi>Cornus,</hi> touching the name in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,
I can sooner prooue that other
men call it false, then I can tell the
right name my selfe; This wood
is as hard as a Horne and very fit
for Shafts, as shal be declared here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ovid</hi> sheweth, that <hi>Syrinx</hi> a
Nymph and one of the handmaids
of <hi>Diana,</hi> had a Bow of this wood,
whereby the Poet meaneth, that it
was the most excellentest for this
purpose; As for <hi>Brazill, Elme,
Wishe</hi> and <hi>Ashe,</hi> experience doth
prove them to be but in the meane
degree, and so to conclude of all
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:12226:37"/>
woods whatsoeuer, the <hi>Ewghe</hi> is
that whereof perfect Shooting
would haue a Bow made; This
wood as it hath long beene and is
now general and common amongst
vs, so was it in former times acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and had in most price, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
amongst the <hi>Romans,</hi> as doth
appeare in this halfe verse of <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil:</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>Taxit or quentur in Arcus—</l>

            </p>
            <p>Now this Bow of <hi>Ewghe,</hi> ought
to be made for perfect shooting at
at the pricke, which Marke, because
it is certaine and most certaine I
will draw &amp; ground all my Rules
from that head onely, and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
because whosoeuer is excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
at it, cannot be ignorant at any
other Marke.</p>
            <p>A good Bow is knowne as good
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:12226:38"/>
counsaile is knowne, by the end,
and profit we receiue by it; yet
both the Bow and good counsaile,
may be made better or worse, by
the well or ill handling of them as
experience teacheth vs; And as a
man, both must and will take coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saile
of a wise and honest man,
though he see not the end of it; So
must an Archer of necessity, trust an
honest &amp; good Bowyer for a Bow,
before he know the proofe of it.
And as a wise, man will store vp
counsaile before hand, to preuent
future euils; so a good Archer,
should euer haue three or foure
Bowes before hand, least sodaine
want might vndoe his pleasure.</p>
            <p>Now, that you may escape gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
mistaking in the election of your
Bow, I will giue you some Rules
and Notions, which if you forget
not, shall preuent many mistakings.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:12226:38"/>If you come into a Shop and
finde a Bow that is small, long, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie,
and strong, lying streight, not
winding, not marr'd with Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shake,
Knot-gall, Wenne, Fret or
pinch, then buy the Bow from my
warrant, the best colour of a Bow
that I finde, is when the Backe and
the belly in working be much what
after one manner, for such often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in wearing, proue like Virgin
waxe or Gold, hauing a fine &amp; long
graine from one end of the Bow to
the other, for a short graine though
it proue well sometimes, yet they
are for the most part very brittle.</p>
            <p>Touching the making of the Bow
I will not greatly meddle, least I
should be found to intrude vpon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
mans Occupation in which
I haue no skill, and so like the Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
goe beyond my <hi>Latchet;</hi> Onely
I would desire all Bowyers to fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:12226:39"/>
theyr Staues well, to worke and
sinke them well, to giue them heats
conuenient, and Tyllering plenty;
For thereby, they shall both get
themselues a good name, (and a
good name increaseth profit) and
also bring a singular commoditie
to the whole Kingdome; If any
man offend in this poynt, I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
they are onely those young
Iourneymen, which labor more to
make many Bowes speedily for
gaine sake, then diligently to make
good Bowes for theryr credit sake,
cleane forgetting this Prouerbe,
<q>Soone enough, if well enough.—</q>
wherewith euery honest Tradsman
should, as with a Rule, measure his
worke, hee that is a Iourney man
&amp; rideth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> another mans horse,
if he ride an honest pace, no man
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:12226:39"/>
will disallow him; But, if hee ride
post or beyond discretion, both
he that oweth the Horse, and he
that after shall buy the Horse may
peraduenture haue cause to curse
him; neither is this fault confined
to any one place, but I feare too
generally dispeirst in diuers parts
of the Kingdome, to the great hure
of that poore remnant of Archers
which yet flourish, and to the great
hinderance of the Kings seruice, if
euer the vertue of that Weapon
shall be reuiued; For belieue it as
a maxime, that the Bow can neuer
be made of too good wood, nor
yet too well seasoned or truly
made with heatings and tyllerings,
neither the Shaft of too good
wood, or too thorowly wrought,
with the best Pinion feathers that
can be gotten; especially, when a
man therwith is to serue his Prince,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:12226:40"/>
defend his Country, and saue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
from his Enemie.</p>
            <p>But to returne againe to the true
knowledge of a well Shooting
Bow, you are to vnderstand, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euery
Bow is made, either of a
Bough, a Plant, or of the Boole of
the tree. The Bough, commonly is
very knottie and full of pinnes,
weake, of small pithe, will
soone follow the string, and sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
weareth to any faire colour;
yet for Boyes and young begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
it may serue well enough.
The Plant, doth many times proue
exceeding well, especially, if it be
of a good and cleane growth, and
for the pith of it, is quicke enough
of cast, it will ply and bowe, farre
before it breake, as all other young
things doe. The Boole of the Tree
is cleanest without Knots or Pins,
hauing a fast and hard wood, by
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:12226:40"/>
reason of his full growth, strong
and mighty of cast, and is the best
of all other for the Bow, if the
Staues be euen clouen, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
well wrought, not ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thwart
the wood, but as the graine
and streight growing of the wood
leadeth a man; or otherwise, by all
reason it must soone breake, and
that in many Shiuers. These things
are to be considered in the rough
wood, and when the Bowstaues be
ouer-wrought and fashioned; For,
in dressing and picking it vp for a
Bow, it is then too late to looke for
it. But yet in these poynts (as I said
before) you must when all is done,
relye vpon the goodnesse of an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
<hi>Bowyer</hi> to put a good Bow in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
your hand; yet not forgetting
your selfe, those Characters which
I haue already shewed you; neither
must you sticke, for a Groat or a
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:12226:41"/>
Shilling more then another man
would giue, if it be a good Bow;
For a good Bow twice payd for, is
better the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an ill Bow once broken.
Thus a shooter must begin, not at
the making of his Bow like a Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer,
but a the buying of his Bow
like an Archer, and when his Bow
is bought and brought home, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he trust too much vpon it, let
him try and trimme it, after this
manner.</p>
            <p>First, take your Bow into the
Field, shoote in it, sinke it with
dead heauy Shafts, looke where it
commeth most and prouide for
that place betimes, before it pinch
and so fret, then when you haue
thus shot in it, &amp; perceiues there is
good shooting wood in it, carry it
then againe to a cunning workman
that is trusty, &amp; let him cut it shor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and pick it &amp; dresse it fitter then
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:12226:41"/>
before, let him make it come round
compasse euery where and whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
at the ends, but with great
discretion, least it whip in sunder,
or else fret before you bee aware,
let him also lay it streight if it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to cast, or otherwise need re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire;
and if the Bow be flat made
gather it vp round, and so shall it
both shoote faster for farre Shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
and also bee surer for neare
Pricking.</p>
            <p>Now albe, some lesse curious
and more thrifty, may account this
second trimming of the Bow, a
pidling and needlesse worke, and
that after a thing is once perfect
there needes no amendment, let
them vnderstand from mee, that it
is no very good token in a Bow
whereof nothing, when it is new
and fresh, need to be cut away or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended;
euen as <hi>Cicero</hi> sayth of a

Young-mans wit and style. For e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
new thing must haue more
then it needeth, or else it will not
grow better and better, but decay
and bee worse and worse. New
Ale, if it runne not ouer the barrell
when it is new tunned, will soone
loose both strength and head; and
that Bow, which at the first buying
without any more proofe or trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
is fit and easie to shoote in,
shall neyther bee profitable to last
long, nor yet pleasant to shoote
well. And therefore, as a young
Horse, full of high courage and
mettall, with artfull handling, is
brought both to a comely pace and
cunning manage; So a new Bow,
fresh and quicke of cast, by sinking
and cutting, is brought to a sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast
Shooting. And an easie and
gentle Bow when it is new, is not
much vnlike a soft spirited boy
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:12226:42"/>
when hee is young, yet as of an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly
boy, with right handling, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
commeth a well ordered man;
so of an vnfit &amp; Staffish Bow, with
good trimming, must needs fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
alwayes a stedfast and true
shooting Bow; and such a perfect
Bow, as will neuer fayle or decay.
And indeed such a Bow euery man
ought to looke for, that will at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
to the end and perfection of
perfect Shooting.</p>
            <p>Now, touching the sauing and
preseruing of this good Bow, when
you are once possest of it and haue
brought it to that perfection, of
which I formerly spake, you shall
then prepare a cloath, eyther of
fine Harden or Woollen, well wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
wherewith euery day you must
rub &amp; chafe your Bow till it shine
and glitter withall, which action
shall cause it both to carry an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:12226:43"/>
colour and complexion,
and also bring ouer it (as it were) a
crust, which will make all the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
so slippery and hard, that ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wet nor weather shall bee able
to enter or hurt it, neyther yet any
Fret or pinch be able to byte vpon
it; insomuch, that you shall doe it
more then extraordinary wrong
before you can breake it. This la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
must be done oftentimes, but
especially when you come from
Shooting; you must haue a great
care when you shoote, of the heads
of your Arrowes, of wearing Dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
Kniues, Poynt tags or Aglets,
least by any mischance they hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to raze or scratch your Bow, a
thing (as I sayd before) both vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seemely
to looke on, and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
for Frets. Also, take heed of
mystie and dankish dayes, for they
are hurtfull to the Bow, and more
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:12226:43"/>
dangerous then rayne; for in such
weather, you must alwayes bee
rubbing the Bow, or forbeare to
shoote.</p>
            <p>When your Bow is thus neatly
trimmed and ordered,<note place="margin">Of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he Bow-case.</note> you may
then put it vp into your <hi>Bow-case,</hi>
which Bow-case seeing it is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
or sauegard for the Bow, I
will speake a little thereof; First,
your <hi>Bow-case</hi> when you ride a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
must by no meanes bee too
wide for your Bowes, for then one
will beate against another and doe
mischiefe, neyther must it be too
strait, so that you shall bee forc'd
to cram them in, for that would
crowd them and lay them to one
side, which would make them to
winde and warpe; but it must bee
of a fit proportion, easily filling
and no more. A <hi>Bow-case</hi> of Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is not the best, for they are for
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:12226:44"/>
the most part moyst, &amp; hurt a Bow;
therefore our best Archers, will
haue for euery Bow a seuerall case,
made either of fine Canuase, or
woollen-cloth, but woollen cloth
is the best, for it not onely keepeth
them in sunder without hurt, but
also preserueth a Bow in its full
strength, that it will neuer giue for
any weather; when your Bowes
are thus cased vp seuerally, you
may then put them vp into your
leather case without danger.</p>
            <p>At home in your owne house,
wood cases made of dry wainscot,
are very good for your Bowes to
stand in, prouided alwayes, your
Bow stand not too neare a stone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall,
for that will make him moist
and weake, nor yet too neare the
fire, for that will make it short and
brittle.</p>
            <p>Thus, I haue shewed you the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:12226:44"/>
preseruations of the Bow,
I will now descend to those things
which are to be auoyded for feare
of breaking the Bow, and they be
foure in number, <hi>viz.</hi> The String,
the Shaft, by drawing too farre,
and by Frets.</p>
            <p>A Bow is broken by the String,<note place="margin">1</note>
(as I haue partly shewed you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
when it is either too short, too
long, not perfectly put on, when it
hath but one wappe, when it is put
on crooked, when it is shorne by
a sharpe nocke, or when it is suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to tarry too long on, any of
these make the string fayle and the
Bow break, especially in the midst,
the reason being, because the ends
haue nothing to stoppe them but
whip so farre backe, that the Belly
must needs rise violently vp and
split in pieces, as you may very ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
perceiue, when at any time you
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:12226:45"/>
will bend a Bow backward; A Bow
therefore that followeth the String
is least hurt with breaking of the
String.</p>
            <p>Secondly, a Bow is broken by
the Shaft, eyther when it is too
short, so that you set it in your
Bow or when the Nocke breakes,
for the littlenesse, or when the
String slips without the Nocke
through the widenesse, then you
pull it to your eare, and let it goe,
which must needs breake the Shaft
at the least, and puts both String,
Bow, and all in hazard, because the
strength of the Bow hath nothing
in it to stop the violence of it; This
kinde of breaking is most dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
for the standers by, for in such
a case, you shall see sometimes the
end of a Bow flie more then a score
from a man, and as I haue noted it,
is euer the vpper end of the Bow.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:12226:45"/>Thirdly, the Bow is broken by
drawing too farre, two seuerall
wayes, either when you take a
longer Shaft then your owne, or
else when you shift your hand too
low or too high for Shooting, and
misse the true midst of the Bow;
and this motion is that, which pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
the backe of the Bow in sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and maketh it flie in many pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
so then you are to obserue,
when a Bow is broken, hauing the
belly rissen vp either both wayes
or but one, then the String brake it,
when it is broken but in two pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and that in a manner euen or es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
in the vpper end, then the
Nocke of the Shaft brake it, and
when the backe is pulled in many
peices, then ouer-drawing brake it.
These tokens are alwayes most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
or very seldome doe misse.</p>
            <p>The 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, and last thing, that brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:12226:46"/>
a Bow, are Frets or Gaules, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>
prepare and make ready a Bow for
breaking by any of the three wayes
formerly spoken off; and these
Frets, are as well in the Arrow as
the Bow, and they are much like a
canker creeping and increasing in
those places where they abide,
which is euer the weakest and most
indigent: And to cure this, your
Bow must be picked &amp; trimmed by
a cunning workman, who will fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see
that it may come round in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe
euery where; For, of Frets
you must beware. If your Bow
haue a knot in the backe, least the
places which be next vnto it, be not
strong enough to beare with the
knot, or else the strong knot will
fret the weake places next vnto it.
Frets at first, are but little pinches,
which assoone as you perceiue,
picke the places about the pinch to
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:12226:46"/>
make them somewhat weaker, and
as well comming as where it pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched;
and so the pinch will dye
and neuer increase further or come
to be a fret: Againe, Bowes most
commonly Fret vnder the hand,
not so much (as some suppose) for
the moystnes of the hand, as for the
heat of the hand, for heat (as <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi>
saith) is apt to loose and not to
knit fast, and the looser the weaker,
and the weaker more apt to Fret.</p>
            <p>A Bow is neuer wel made, which
hath not plenty of wood in the
hand, for if the ends of the Bow be
staffish, or a mans hand any thing
hot, the belly must needs soone
Fret.</p>
            <p>Now, for the cure of these Frets,
I haue not heard of any to any
great purpose, more then to make
the Fretted place as strong or
stronger then any other, touching
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:12226:47"/>
the filling of the Fret vp with the
small Shiuers of a quill and Glew,
(which some hold good) yet both
by reason &amp; mine opinion it must
needs be starke naught, for put case
the Fret doe cease then, yet the
cause which made it fret before
(which is onely weaknesse) is not
taken away, and therefore conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
the place must needs fret
againe. As for cutting out of Frets,
together with all manner of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
of Bowes, I vtterly dislike
them, as things not fit for a good
Archer, for pierced Bowes, are like
olde houses which are more
chargeable to repaire, then co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
to dwell in; and againe, to
Swaddle a Bow much with bands,
how euer necessity may make it
vse full, yet it seldome doth any
good, except it be to keepe downe
a Spell in the Backe, otherwise
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:12226:47"/>
bands eyther neede not when the
Bow is any thing worth, or else
Boote not when it is spoyled. And
though I know many poore Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
will vse pieced and banded
Bowes, because they are not able
to get better, yet I am sure if they
consider it well, they shall finde it
lesse chargeable and more pleasure,
to bestow a Crowne on a new Bow
then to giue tweluepence for pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
of an old, for better is cost vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
some what worth, then expence
vpon that which is naught worth.
And this I write the rather, because
I intreat onely of the perfection of
Shooting.</p>
            <p>Againe, there is another thing
which will soone occasion a Bow
to be broken by one of the wayes
before named, and that is shooting
in the winter leason when there is
any great Frost; for Frosts are euer,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:12226:48"/>
wheresoeuer there is any waterish
humor, as is in all kinde of wood,
eyther more or lesse, and 'tis true,
that all things frozen and Icie, will
rather breake then bend; yet if any
man must needs shoote at such a
time, let him take his Bow and
bring it to the fire, and thereby a
little rub and chafe it with a waxed
cloth, which will quickly bring it
to that perfection that he may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>afe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
shoote without danger: This
rubbing with waxe (as I said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
is a great succour against all
wet and moystnesse, and as youthus
rub your Bow at the fire; so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
in the field and going betwixt
your Markes, cither with your
hand or else with a cloath, keepe
your Bow in such a temper, as the
frost may not annoy it.</p>
            <p>And thus much concerning the
Bow, how first to know what
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:12226:48"/>
wood is best, then how to chuse
a Bow, after how to trim it, then
how to keepe it in goodnesse; and
lastly, how to saue it from all harm
and mischiefe. And although ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
both can and may say more in
this Subiect then my selfe, yet
what I haue said is true, and I hope
sufficient for any reasonable know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>

Greeke or Latine, for shafts to be

common as Reeds; <hi>Herodotus</hi> in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing
the mighty hoast of

the <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> the <hi>Lycians</hi> (whose
Shafts had no feathers, at which I
much maruaile) and the <hi>Indians.</hi>
The <hi>Indian</hi> Shafts were very long,
as a yard and an halfe (according
to <hi>Apian</hi>
               <note place="margin">Apian, li. 8</note>) or at the least a full yard,

which made them giue the greater

In <hi>Creet</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> they made their

            <p>The best Reeds for Shafts grew

Woods, as namely, Fifteene in

                  <item>Sallow.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>These Woods, as they are most
commonly vsed, so they are most
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:12226:50"/>
fit to be vsed, yet some are more
excellent then others, as you shall
heare in their proper place, and in
this instrument as in your Bow, you
must repose your confidence in the
honest Fletcher. And although I
cannot teach you to make a Bow
or an Arrow, because it is the Art
of the Artificers; yet, I will shew
you those Rules and Characters,
which shall make you able to judge
and discerne the goodnesse and
badnesse of a Shaft, which is as
much, as a good Archer can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.</p>
            <p>First then, the <hi>Steele</hi> of an Arrow,
must be well seasoned for feare of
casting, and it must be wrought as
the graine goeth or else it will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
flye cleane or true; for as cloth
cut ouerthwart and against the
wooll, euer maketh an imperfect
garment; So a knotty Steele may
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:12226:51"/>
passe in a bigge Shaft, but in a little
one it is intollerable, both because
it wil neuer fly farre, &amp; also because
it is euer in danger of breaking;
It cannot flye farre, because the
strength of the shot is hindered and
stopped at the knot, euen as a Stone
cast into a smooth water will make
the water mooue and make many
circles; yet if there be any deepe or
whirling plat in the water, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
will cease, and the circles va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
so soone as they approach it, so
is it, with a knottie Shaft that cannot
flye when the ayre takes it; for eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing as it is plaine &amp; straight of
its owne nature, is fittest for farre
moouing. Therefore, a <hi>Steele</hi> that is
hard tost and in a Bow, without knot
and streight (I meane not artificial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
streight, as the Fletcher doth
make it, but naturally streight as it
groweth) is absolutely the best to
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:12226:51"/>
make a Shaft on, eyther to goe
cleane, fly farre, or to stand surely in
any weather.</p>
            <p>Now how bigge, how small,
how heauie, how long, how short
a shaft should be particularly for
euery man (because I am bound to
discourse of the generall Nature of
this Nature of this Art, and not
the hidden adiuncts) it cannot be
discouered, no more then Rethori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
can appoint any one kinde of
words, Sentences, Figures and
Tropes, for euery matter; but euen
as the man and the Subiect doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
obseruing still that the fittest
be vsed. Therefore, as concerning
these contraries in Shafts, euery
man must auoyd them, and draw e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
extremity to his meane or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
estate, which is the best in
all things; yet if any man happen
to offend in any excesse, it is better
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:12226:52"/>
to offend in want and scantnesse,
then in too much or ouerflowing;
and it is better to haue a Shaft a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
too short, then any thing too
long; some what too light, then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
lumpish; a little too small, then
a great deale too big; which thing,
is not onely true in Shooting, but in
all things else, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> a man vnderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth,
especially in eating &amp; talking.</p>
            <p>The offence of these contraryes
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth most, when a man is care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
and respecteth not of what
kinde of wood his Arrow is made;
for some wood belongs to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
part, some to the scant part,
and some to the meane. As <hi>Brazill,
Turkie-wood, Fusticke, Sugar-chest,</hi>
and the like; make dead, heauie, lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
and cobling Shafts; the <hi>Hudder,
Black-thorne,</hi> the <hi>Seruis-tree, Beech,
Elder, Aspe,</hi> and <hi>Sallow,</hi> either for
their ouer-weakenesse or lightnes,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:12226:52"/>
make hollow, starting, scudding,
gadding shafts. But <hi>Birch, Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beame,</hi>
some <hi>Oake,</hi> and some <hi>Ashe,</hi>
being both strong enough to stand
in a Bow, and also light enough to
flye farre, are best for a meane de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
which is to bee sought out in
every thing: And although I know
some men shoot so strong, that the
heauyest wood is light enough for
them; and other some so weake,
that the loose and lightest Wood
will hardly serue them: yet gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
for the most part of men, the
meane woods are the best; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to conclude, that wood is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
best for a man, which is most
correspondent to his strength. And
thus, no wood of his owne nature,
is eyther too light, or too beauie,
but according to the strength of
the Archer which doth vse it; and
that Shaft which this yeare was for
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:12226:53"/>
a man too light and scudding, for
the selfe-fame man the next yeare
may be too heauy and hobling:
Therefore cannot I expresse other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
then generally what is the best
wood for an Arrow, but let euery
one when hee knoweth his owne
strength, and the nature of euery se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall
wood, prouide and fit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
thereatrer; Yet as concerning
Sheaf-Arrowes for the Warres (as
I suppose) it were better to make
them of good <hi>Ashe,</hi> as they were
in former times, and not of <hi>Aspe,</hi> as
they be now, for of all the woods
that euer I prooued, <hi>Ashe</hi> being big
is the swiftest, and giueth the fairest
blow, by reason of its heauinesse;
both which qualities the <hi>Aspe</hi> wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth;
what the benefit of Armour
is, euery man can judge by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
therefore that which pierceth
it most, is most worthy; then <hi>Ashe</hi>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:12226:53"/>
being both swifter and heauyer, it
must be the deeper wounder, and
so fittest for the Sheafe; And thus
much, of the choyce of seuerall
Woods.</p>
            <p>Now, as no Wood can bee abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
meet for all ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of shafts,
no more can one fashion of the
<hi>Steele</hi> be fit for euery Archer; for
those that be little brested, and big
towards the head, called for theyr
likenesse Capon-fashion, Rush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>growne,
and of some merry fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
Bob-tayles, are fittest for
them which shoot vnder-hand, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they shoot with a soft loose,
and straines not a shaft much in the
Breast, where the weight of the
Bow lyeth, as you may perceiue
by the wearing of euery Shaft; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
the big-breasted Shaft is fit
for him that shooteth right before
him; as also, the Breast being weake
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:12226:54"/>
cannot possibly withstand a strong
pithie kinde of Shooting. Thus the
vnderhand must haue a small breast
to goe cleere away out of the Bow,
and the fore-hand must haue a big
breast to beare the great might of
the Bow.</p>
            <p>Euery Shaft must be made round
&amp; not flat, without Gall or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>,
because roundnesse (whether you
take example fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Heauen or Earth)
is the fittest shape or forme both
for fast moouing, and also for
soone piercing of any thing, and
therefore ARISTOTLE sayth; that
Nature hath made the drops of
Raine round, because it shall the
sooner enter through the Ayre.</p>
            <p>The nocke of the Shaft is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versly
made, for some be great and
full, some handsome and little, some
wide, some narrow, some deepe,
some shallow, some round, some
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:12226:54"/>
long, some with one Nocke, and
some with a double Nocke, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
euery one hath his seuerall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty;
as thus: The great and full
Nocke may be well felt, and doth
divers waies save a shaft from brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king;
the handsome little Nocke
will goe cleane from the hand; the
wide Nocke is naught both for
breaking the Shaft, and also for
suddaine slipping out of the string,
when the narrow Nocke avoideth
both these injuries: The deepe and
long Nocke is good in the Warres
for sure keeping of the String, the
Shallow and round Nocke is the
best of all other for our purpose in
pricking, both for cleane deline<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of a shoot, and fine sending a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
of the Arrow; and the dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Nocke is for a double suretie of
the Shaft. And this I thinke is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
touching the <hi>Steele</hi> of the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:12226:55"/>
Arrow onely in Generall.</p>
            <p>Now for the piecing of an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
with <hi>Brazill, Holley,</hi> or other
heauye Wood, it is to make the
end compasse heauie with the Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
in flying, for the stedfaster
shooting; for if the end were
plumb'd heauie with Leade, and
the Wood next it light, the head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end
would euer bee downeward,
and never flye streight. Now in
piecing, you must conceiue that
two points are euer enough for one
shaft, least the moystnesse of the
Earth enter too much into the pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
and so loosen the glew; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
many points are more pleasing
to the eye, then profitable for
vse; Some vse to piece their shafts
in the Nocke with <hi>Brasill</hi> or <hi>Holley,</hi>
to counterpoyse with the Head, &amp;
I have seene some for the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
boare an hole a little beneath
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:12226:55"/>
the Nocke, and put leade into it;
yet for mine owne part, I allow not
any of those wayes, because the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of a Feather in flying (if a man
mark it wel) is able to beare vp a wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
weight; therefore I imagine
this manner of piecing at the nocke
was drawne from this President;
when a good Archer had broken a
good shaft with which hee was
much enamoured, both in loue to
the Feathers, and out of a fancie not
to loose what he did formerly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
hee hath caused it thus to bee
pieced, which others perceiuing,
(without any examination of the
cause, but pleas'd with the gaudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse)
haue presently imitated, and
not onely cut one, but all in theyr
Quiuer; A thing, in my judgement
much more costly then necessary;
therefore let no man make himselfe
anothers Ape without argument,
without discretion.</p>

            <head>CHAP. X. Of the Feather, the Nature, excellence
and vse.</head>
            <p>THere is not any thing in all
the Art of Archerie more
seriously to be lookt into
then the Feather of the Shaft; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
first a question may be asked,
whether any other thing beside a
Feather be fit for a shaft or no; then
if a feather onely be fit, whether a
Goose Feather onely or no; if a
Goose Feather be best, then whether
there be any difference as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Feather of an old Goose or a
young, a Gander or a Goose, a Fenny
Goose or an vpi and Goose: Againe,
w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is the best Feather in any Goose
the right wing or the left, the pini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Feather or any other Feather; a
white, a blacke, or a gray Feather;
Thirdly, in setting on the Feather
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:12226:56"/>
whether it is pared or drawn with
a thicke Rib or with a thinne, (the
Ribbe is the hard quill which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uideth
the Feathers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whether a long
Feather bee better then a short,
whether to be set on neare the
Nocke or farre from the Nocke,
whether to be set on streight or
somewhat bowing, and whether
one or two Feathers must runne on
the Bow; lastly, in Couling or She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
whether it must be done high
or low, whether somewhat Swine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backed
(I must vse Archers words)
or Saddle-backed, whether round or
square shorne. And whether a Shaft
at any time ought to be plucked,
and how to be plucked; Of these
things in their order.</p>
            <p>First therefore, whether any
thing else may be vsed but a Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
both <hi>Plinie</hi> in Latine, and <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius
Pollux</hi> in Greeke doe proue, that
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:12226:57"/>
Feathers alwayes haue beene vsed;
and but onely the <hi>Lycians</hi> of whom
I reade in <hi>Herodotus,</hi> did vse Shafts
without Feathers; vnderstand then,
that onely a Feather is fit for a
Shaft, and that for two reasons:
First, because it is leath-weake to
giue place to the Bow, then because
it is of that nature that it will start
vp after the Bow, which plate,
wood or horne, cannot do, because
they will not giue place; and againe
Cloth, paper or parchment, cannot
serue, because they also will not
rise vp after the Bow; therefore the
Feather onely is meet, for it will
doe both; Now if you please to
behold the Feathers of all manner
of Byards, you shall see some so
low, weake and short, some so
course, stoore and hard, and the rib
so brittle, thinne and narrow, that
it can neyther be drawne, pared, nor
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:12226:57"/>
well set on: So that, except it be a
Swan feather for a dead shaft (as I
know some good Archers haue v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed)
or a Ducks for a Flight, which
lasteth but one shoote, there is no
Feather but onely of a Goose, that
hath all ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities in it;
&amp; for the Peacocks Feather, which
some men doe vse at a short Butt, it
seldom or neuer keeps vp the shaft,
eyther right or leuell, by reason
that it is so rough and heauie; inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much,
that many which haue taken
them vp for their gaynesse, haue
layd them downe againe for theyr
profit; So that I conclude, the
Goose of all Feathers is the best for
a compleat Archer, and he that will
goe beyond it, let him be <hi>Hercules</hi>
Scholler and not mine, who fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
his Arrowes with the
wings of an Eagle, a Fowle that
flyes so high, and builds so farre
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:12226:58"/>
off, that I had rather content my
selfe with the gentle Goose, then
search for the others Feathers. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially,
because the Goose brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
euen to a mans doore so many
excellent commodities: for the
Goose is mans comfort both in
warre and peace, sleeping and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
what praise soeuer can be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
to shooting, the Goose may
challenge the best part: how well
doth shee make a man fare at his
Table, how easily doth she make
a man lye in his Bed, &amp; how braue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
doth her quils make vs write, &amp;
record euery occurrent: I doe not
think that the <hi>Romans</hi> giue so much
honour to the Goose for sauing the
Capitoll, when they set her golden
Statue thereon, and appointed the
Censors to allow out of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Treasurie yearely Stipends
for the maintainance of those Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:12226:58"/>
they did it not (I say) so much
for that one good act, as for a world
of others, which we dayly and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
hourely receiue from them;
insomuch, that if I were bound to
declaime in the praise of any Beast
liuing, I would choose the Goose:
But leauing this digression: Now
how a Feather must bee had<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
what Feaaher is best; it followeth
now, whether of a young Goose,
or an old; the old Goose Feather
is stiffe and strong, good for a
winde, and fittest for a dead Shaft;
The young Goose Feather is weake
and fine, and are best for a swift
shaft, and it must be caulled at the
first shearing some what high: for
in shooting, it will settle very
much; The same things (although
not so much) are to be considered
both in Goose and Gander; A Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Goose, euen as her flesh is blac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:12226:59"/>
stoorer and vnwholsomner, so
are her Feathers by the same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
courser, stoorer and worse for
that purpose; whence it comes, that
I haue heard many skilfull Flet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
say, that the second Feather
in some place, is better then the
Pinion in other; Betwixt the wings
is little differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, but that you must
haue diuers Shafts of one flight,
feathered with diuers wings for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
winds; for if the Winde and
the feather goe both one way, the
Shaft will be carryed too much.
The Pinion Feathers, as they haue
the first place in the Wing, so they
haue the first place in Feathering,
this feather you may know before
it be pared, by a baight which is
in it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and againe, when it is coul'd
by the thinnesse aboue, and the
thickenesse at the ground, and also
by the stiffenesse and finenesse,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:12226:59"/>
which will carry a Shaft better, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
and further then any other Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>Touching the colour of the Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
it is the least of many other
things to be regarded, yet is it
worthy some notice; because for a
good white you haue sometimes
an ill gray, yet surely it standeth
with good reason, euer to haue the
Cocke feather blacke or gray; as it
were to giue a man warning to
Nocke right. The Cocke Feather
is that which standeth aboue in
right Nocking, which if you doe
not obserue, the other Feathers
must needs runne on the Bow, and
so spoyle the shoote.</p>
            <p>Now concerning the setting on
of the Feather, you are principally
to regard, that your Feather be not
drawne for hastinesse, but pared
with diligence and made streight.
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:12226:60"/>
The Fletcher is sayd to draw a fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
when he hath but one swap at
it with his knife, And he is said to
pare it, when he taketh leisure and
heede to make euery part of the
Ribbe apt to stand streight, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
vpon the Steele. This thing if a
man doth not take heede of, hemay
chance to haue cause to say of his
Fletcher, as we say of good meat ill
drest; the Feathersare praise-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,
but the Fletcher too blame.</p>
            <p>The Rib in a stiffe feather may be
drawne thinner, for so it will stand
cleaner, on the shaft, but in a weake
feather you must leaue a thicker Rib,
for if the Rib w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is the foundation
ground whereon Nature hath set
euery cleft of the feather be taken
away too neare the feather; It must
needs follow, that the feather shall
fall and drop downe, euen as an
hearbe doth w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> hath his Root too
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:12226:60"/>
neare taken away with the Spade.</p>
            <p>The length and shortnesse of the
feather serueth for diuers purposes
and diuers Shafts, as a long feather
for a long, heauy and big Shaft, the
short Feather for the contrary; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
the short may stand farther,
the long nearer the Nocke, your
Feather must stand almost streight
on, yet after that sort that it may
turne round in flying; Now here I
consider the wonderfull nature of
Shooting, which standeth altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by that fashion which is most
apt for quicke moouing, which is
onely Roundnesse; for the Bow
must be gathered round in draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
it must come a Round com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe,
the String must be round, the
steele round, the best nocke round,
the Feather shorne somewhat
round<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Shaft in flying must
turne round, and if it flie farre it fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:12226:61"/>
a round compasse, for either
aboue or beneath a Round com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe
hindereth the flying; More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer,
both the Fletcher in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
your Shaft, and you in Noc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
your Shaft, must take he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
that two Feathers run equally on
the Bow, for if one Feather runne
alone on the Bow, it will quickly
be worne &amp; not able to match with
the other Feathers, besides at the
loose (if the Shaft be light) it will
start, if it bee heauie it will hobble.</p>
            <p>To coule, sheare or cut the Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of a shaft high or low, it must
be done according as the Shaft is
light or heauie, great or little, long
or short: The Swine-backed fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
maketh the Shaft dead, for it ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth
more Ayre then the Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle-backed
doth, therefore the
Saddle-backe is surer for danger of
weather, and fitter for smooth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:12226:61"/>
Againe, to sheare a Shaft round,
as they were wont in former times
to doe, or after the Tryangle-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion
which is much vsed now; in
these times, both are good: For
Roundnesse is apt for flying of its
owne nature, and all manner of
Tryangles, (the sharpe point going
before) is also apt for quicke en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring;
and therefore sayth CICE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RO,<note place="margin">Ci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. de Nat. Deor</note>
That <hi>Cranes</hi> taught by Nature,
doe in flying alwayes observe a
Tryangle fashion, because it is so
apt to pierce and goe through the
Ayre.</p>
            <p>Lastly, plucking of Feathers is
naught, for there is no surety in it,
therefore let euery Archer haue
such Shafts, that hee may both
know them and trust them vpon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
change of weather; yet if
they must needs be plucked, pull
them as little as can be, for so shall
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:12226:62"/>
they be lesse constant; And thus I
haue shut vp in a straight Roome,
what can be sayd of the best Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
feathering and fashioning of
a perfect Shaft, I will now proceed
to the Head.</p>

the shape of a new Moone, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
he could cut off the head of a
bird, and not touch her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>
            <p>But letting passe the customes of
the Antients: Our <hi>English</hi> heads
which we customarily vse in the
warres, are better then either for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
heads or broad arrow heads;
for first, the end being lighter they
flye a great deale faster, and by the
same reason giue a farre more
deadly blow, and in my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
(which is no Rule) if the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Barbs or Beards which they
haue, were taken away they would
be farre better, for this euery man
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:12226:65"/>
will grant, that a Shaft so long as it
flyeth turneth, and when it leaueth
to turne, it leaueth to flye any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and that euery thing which
enters by a turning and boaring
fashion, the more flatter it is the
worse it enters, as a Knife though
it be sharpe, yet it cannot boare so
well as a Bodkin; therefore sayth
<hi>Aristotle,</hi> Nature made euery thing
round, that should pierce deepe;
so that I conclude, eyther the
Shaft doth not turne in flying, or
or else our flat heads are hinderan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to the Shafts in entering. Now
some may say, that a flat head both
makes a greater hole, and stickes
much faster: to this I say, that
both the reasons are true, yet both
insufficient; for first, the lesser the
hole is (if it be deepe) the worse it
is to heale, and a man when hee
shooteth against his enemy, desireth
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:12226:65"/>
rather that it should enter farre,
then sticke fast; for what remedy
is it I pray you, for him that is
smitten with a deep wound, to pull
out the Shaft quickly, except it be
to hasten his death; thus heads
which make a little hole and deepe,
are better in the Warre, then those
which make great and shallow;
though they sticke never so fast
in.</p>

that purpose:<note place="margin">Herod. vran.</note> 
               <hi>Herodotus</hi> speakes of
a wonderfull Stratagem done by
<hi>Xerxes,</hi> at what time he besiedged
the great Tower at <hi>Athens,</hi> where
hee made his Archers binde theyr
Shaft heads about with Towe, and
then set it on fire, and so shot them
off: which being done by many,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:12226:66"/>
set all the places on fire, which
were made of any matter that
would burne: and besides so daz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the enemy, that they knew not
which way to turne them: But to
finish these heads for Warre, I
would wish, that all the Head-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
in <hi>England,</hi> would make their
Sheaffe-arrow heads more harder
poynted then they be, or else as
they are now out of vse, so they
will bee without any power to
hurt.</p>
            <p>Now as concerning heads for
pricking, which is one of the maine
ends of this discourse, they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
into diuers kinds, some are
blunt heads, some sharpe, some
both blunt and sharpe.</p>
            <p>The blunt heads men vse, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they finde them good to
keepe a length, and it is true that
they keepe a length, because a man
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:12226:66"/>
pulleth them no further at one time
then at another, for in feeling the
plumpe end alwayes equally, hee
may loose them, yet in the Wind
and against the Wind, the weather
hath so much power on the broad
end, that no man can keepe a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
length truely, with such an
head: therefore a blunt head in a
calme or downe Winde, is very
good, otherwise, none worse.</p>
            <p>A sharpe head at the end, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any shoulders (I call that a
shoulder, which a mans finger may
feele before it come to the poynt
of the head) will pierce quickly
through a Winde; but yet it hath
two discommodities; the one, that
it will keepe no length, because no
man can pull it at a certainety, but
it will come more or lesse through
the want of the shoulder; and also,
because men are affrayd of the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:12226:67"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">

               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:12226:68"/>
sharpe poynt, for feare of setting it
in the Bow; The second discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity
is, when it is lighted on
the ground, the small point will be
euer in the danger of spoyling,
which thing of all others, will
soonest make a shaft to loose the
length.</p>
            <p>Now when men perceiued that
blunt heads were good to keepe a
length, but naught for a winde; and
sharpe heads good to pierce a wind
withall, but naught to keepe a
length, the head-makers (informed
both by the Archers and the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers)
and wisely weying the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
and discommodities of
both sorts of heads, Inuented new
files and other instruments where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
they brought heads for pric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
to such perfection, that in one
head they lodged all the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
which were in both the other,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:12226:68"/>
without any discomoditie at all.
These heads they call High-rigged,
Crested, or Shouldred-heads, or
Siluer-spoone-heads, for a resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
they haue to the knobs vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
some Siluer-spoones. These
heads are good both to keepe a
length, and also to pierce the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with all. First, to keepe a length
withall, because a man may cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely
pull it to the shoulder eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
shoote and no further, then to
pierce the wind withal, because the
point from the shoulder forward,
breaketh the weather as all other
sharpe things doe, so the blunt
shoulder serueth for a sure length
keeping, and the poynt for passing
through a rough and foule weather.
And thus much for the matter,
shape and choyse of Heads.</p>
            <p>Now touching the setting on of
the head, albe it is the office of the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:12226:69"/>
Fletcher, rather then the Archer;
yet it is within the compasse of
your owne knowledge, to aduise
him to set your head full on or
close on. Full on, is when the wood
is let hard vp to the end or stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
of the head, and close, is when
there is wood left on euery side the
shaft to fill the head withall, or
when it is neither too little nor
too great; If there be any fault in
either of these points, the head
when it lighteth on a stone or the
hard ground will be in danger ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of breaking, or some other mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe.</p>
            <p>Touching the stopping of heads
with leade or any thing else, I shall
not need here to speake any thing,
because euery Siluer-spoone or
should red head, is stopped of it
selfe.</p>
            <p>Short heads are better then long,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:12226:69"/>
because the long head is worse for
the workeman to file streight, and
more difficult to keepe in a true
compasse euery where; Againe, it
is worse for the Fletcher to set on
streight; and thirdly, it is alwaies
in more daunger to be broken: And
thus I haue done with the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Instruments, I will now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to those which be Generall.</p>

Art of Shooting: therefore he that

            <p>Yet mistake me not, for I speake

hath neglected it in his younger

that I will proue, <hi>Wisedome</hi> may
worke the same thing in a man,
which Nature doth in a Child.</p>
            <p>A child, by 3. things is brought

Desire,</hi> and <hi>Feare:</hi> First, <hi>Aptnesse</hi>

diligent heed in learning any thing,
whereof proceedeth at the least,
Excellencie and Perfection: And
as thus, so a man may by wisedome
(in learning any thing and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
to shoote) haue three like
commodities also, whereby hee
may (as it were) become young a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
and so attaine to perfection.
For what <hi>Aptnesse</hi> worketh in a
Child, that the vse of weake Bowes
will worke in a man; being vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
his strength, and so easie that
hee may come to faire shooting at

            <p>ALthough the best shooting,

and that they are such
Adjuncts as cannot bee divided;
yet <hi>Cicero</hi> tels me, that as the chiefe

<hi>Comelinesse,</hi> so this comelinesse on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
can neuer be taught by any Art
or Craft, but may bee perceiued
well when it is done, not described
wel, how it should be done. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse,
there are many wayes to
attaine vnto it, which wise men
haue assayed, and though not abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
in it, yet in other matters of
like consequence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as thus, it is
written, of <hi>Xeuxes,</hi> that taking vpon
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:12226:72"/>
him to paint <hi>Helena</hi> in all her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
chose out fiue of the fairest
Maides in all his Country, and in
beholding them, conceiued and
drew out such a Picture, that it far
exceeded all the pieces, that euer
went before it; because the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
of all those fiue, was drawn
into one portraiture: So likewise
in shooting, if a man would set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his eyes, fiue or sixe of the fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
and best approoued Archers,
that euer he saw shoote, and of one
learne to stand, of another to draw,
of another to loose, and so take fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
euery man, what euery man could
doe best; I dare be bold to say, he
should come to such perfection in
comelinesse, as neuer yet any man
attained vnto. But it may be you
will expect, because I haue chosen
that Theame, that necessarily I
ought to speake something, in the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:12226:73"/>
way of instruction thereunto, but
truely I must answer you, that I
can teach you to shoot fayre, as
<hi>Socrates</hi> once taught a man to know
God, for when he asked him what
God was, nay (sayd he) I can bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
tell you what God is not, as
God is not euill, &amp;c. Euen so can
I say of faire shooting, that it hath
not this nor that discommodity, &amp;
so drayning from it all discommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
in the end, leaue nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde
but faire shooting. And to
doe this the better, you must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member;
that in the beginning,
when I described generally the
whole nature of Shooting, I told
you that faire Shooting did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from these fiue seuerall <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures:
Standing, Nocking, Draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Holding,</hi> and <hi>Loosing:</hi> all which,
I will goe ouer as succinctly and
briefly as I can, describing the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodities
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:12226:73"/>
that men commonly
vse in all parts of theyr bodyes,
when they imploy them to these
Actions, so that at any time when
you shall erre or offend in any of
the motions, you shall both speedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
apprehend it, and with as great
diligence amend it.</p>
            <p>Faults in Archers, doe exceed
the number of Archers, and they
prodeed from the vse of shooting
without teaching; For Custome
and vse separated from knowledge,
and learning, doth not onely hurt
shooting, but the most materiall &amp;
weightiest Actions in the world;
and therefore, I wonder much at
those people, which will offer to
be the maintainers of vses and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes,
without knowledge, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
no other wordes in their
mouthes but these, <hi>Vse, Vse, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome,
Custome;</hi> which besides di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:12226:74"/>
other discommodities, brings
with it this mischiefe, that it takes
from a man all hope of amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>There is nothing more true, then
that in shooting, <hi>Vse</hi> is the onely
cause of all the faults therin; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
it comes, that Children are more
easily and sooner taught to shoot
excellently then Men; because
Children may bee taught to shoot
well at the first: Men haue more
trouble to vnlearne theyr euil Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes,
then they haue labour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
to come to good Shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>
            <p>All the discommodities, which
ill custom hath grafted in Archers,
can neyther be quickly pulled out,
nor yet soone reckoned by mee,
they are so many; For one shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
his head forward, as if hee
would byte the Marke, another,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:12226:74"/>
stareth with his Eyes, as if they
should flye after his Arrow; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
winketh with one eye &amp; ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
the other, as if hee shot in a
Stone-bow; one maketh a sowre
face, another a wry countenance;
one bleereth out his tongue, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
biteth his lip, &amp; another hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
his Necke awry; In drawing,
some fetch such a Compasse, as
if they would turne about, and
blesse the Field, others haue
their hand now vp, now downe,
that a man cannot discerne where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at
they would shoote, another
waggeth the upper end of his Bow
one way, &amp; the neather end another:
another will stand poynting his
shaft at the marke a good space, and
by &amp; by he will giue him a whip &amp;
away, ere any man is aware, another
will make such a wrastling and
strugling with his Instruments, as

               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:12226:76"/>
if he were able shoote no more as
long as he liued; Anothet draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
his shaft softly to the midst, and
by and byit is gone you cannot tell
how; Another draweth his shaft
low at the brest as if he would
shoote a rooueing marke, and
presently he lifteth vp his hand
prick-height; Another maketh a
a wrinching or cringing with his
Back, as though a man pinched him
behind; Another cowreth downe
and thrusts out his Buttocks, as if
he were shooting at Crowes; An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
setteth forward his left leg,
and draweth backe with his Necke
and shoulders, as if he were pulling
at a rope or else were afraid of the
marke; Another draweth his shaft
well vntill within two fingers of
the head, and then he stayeth a little
to looke at his marke, which done,
he pulleth it vp to the head and so
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:12226:76"/>
looseth, which manner of shooting
although some excellent Archers
doe vse it, yet it is a Fault; and good
mens faultes are not to be Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated.</p>
            <p>Once I heard of a man, which v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
a Bracer on his cheeke, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
he had torne all the skin from
one side of his face with his draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-hand,
Another I haue seene,
which at euery shoote after the
loose would lift vp his leg so farre
that he was euer in danger of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling;
Some will stampe forward
and some leape backward, and all
these faults are eyther in drawing
or loosing, with a world of others,
which any man may easily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
and so endeauour to avoide
them:</p>
            <p>Now there be other faults after
the shaft is gone from the Bow,
which onely euill custome hath
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:12226:77"/>
brought vpon men, of which the
worst is, when men will cry after
their shafts either with execrations
or other vnseemely words, much
vnfit for so honest a Recreation;
questionalesse such words are the
Symptoms of an euill mind, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play a
man that is subiect to immea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surable
affections; good-mens eares
doe abhorre them, and an honest
man will avoyd them. Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
these, there be others, which
haue others faults; as some will take
there Bow and writh and wring itto
pull in there shaft when it flieth
wide, as if he droue a cart; some wil
giue two or three strides forward
dauncing and hopping after his
shaft, as long as it flyeth; some with
feare to be too farre gone runne
backward as it were to pull their
shaft backe, another runneth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
when he feareth to be short
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:12226:77"/>
heauing after his Armes as though
he would helpe the Arrow to flye;
another runs aside to pull his Shaft
streight, one lifteth vp his heele &amp;
so holds it till the shaft be falne,
another casteth his Arme backward
after the loose, and another swings
his Bow about him like a whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ler
before a Pageant to make roome;
with a world of other errors, now
out of my remembrance. All
which, <hi>Montaigne</hi> in one of his <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayes,</hi>
cals the Discharging of passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
vpon a wrong subiect. Now
these Antick gestures, disfigure and
take away all comlinesse from this
noble action; So, that Archer which
is voyd of all these crimes, cannot
but possesse the perfection of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines
in this Art, which how soeuer
it cannot be exprest to the life, in
words, yet (I will according to my
small knowledge) giue you some
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:12226:78"/>
small Character thereof, which if
any man shall please to follow,
though I cannot make him vtterly
Faultlesse, yet his Faults shall nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

I will draw from these fiue princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
<hi>Postures; Standing, Nocking,
Drawing, Holding,</hi> and <hi>Loosing,</hi>
which being done in perfection,

            <p>THe first <hi>Posture</hi> or Poynt
which a man ought to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
when he goeth about
to Shoote, is to take such Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Standing, as shall be both
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:12226:78"/>
comely to the eye, and profitable
for the action he hath in hand, set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
his countenance and all other
parts of his body, after such a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
and port, that both all his
Strength may be imployed to his
owne most absolute aduantage, and
his Shoote made and handled to
the high contentment and delight
of euery well judging beholder;
And first, a man must not goe to it
too hastily, for that is Rashnesse,
nor yet be too tedious or make too
much a doe about it, for that is
Curiosity. Next, the one foote
must not stand too farre from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
least he stoop too much, which
is most vnseemely; nor yet too
neare together, least he stand too
streight vp, for then he shall ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
vse his strength well, nor stand
as he ought, stedfastly; the meane
betwixt both these must be kept.

Nocking.</head>
            <p>TO Nocke well, is the easiest
point in all the Art of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery,
and containeth no
more but ordinary warning, onely
it requireth diligent heed giuing;
First in putting the Nock betweene
your two first fingers, then bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the shaft vnder the String and
ouer the Bow, then to set the shaft
neyther too high nor too low, but
euen and streight ouerthwart the
Bow; For vnconstant Nocking,
maketh a man loose his length, and
besides that, if his Shaft hand bee
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:12226:79"/>
high, and the Bow hand low, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
if they be contrarily pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
both the Bow is in danger of
breaking, and the Shaft if it be lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
will start, and if it be great it
will hobble.</p>
            <p>You must obserue euer, to Nocke
the Cocke Feather vpward, as I
told you before, when I described
the Feather; and bee sure that the
String slip not out of the Nocke,
but with your Thumbe before, &amp;
a finger on each side behind, hold
it fast till it be drawne, for should
it happen otherwise, all were in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard

Drawing.</head>
            <p>DRawing well, is the best
part of Shooting; the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients
in times past, vsed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
manner of drawing then we
doe: For they drew low at the
Brest, and to the right Pap; as is
described by <hi>Homer:</hi> The noble
women of <hi>Scythia,</hi> vsed the same
fashion of shooting low at the
breast, and because their left Paps
hindered them, they caused them
to be cut away when they were
young, vpon which action, they
tooke to themselues the name of
<hi>Amazons.</hi> But now in these dayes,
contrary to that custome, we draw
to the right Eare, &amp; not to the Pap;
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:12226:80"/>
now whether the old way in
drawing low to the Pap, or the
new way to draw aloft to the eare,
bee better; <hi>Percopius</hi> an excellent
Greeke Author doth decide:<note place="margin">Percop. Hist. Pers.</note> shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that the old fashion in drawing
to the Pap was naught, hauing no
pyth in it, and therefore (sayth he)
is Artillery dispraised of <hi>Homer,</hi>
who calleth it weake, and able to
doe no good. But drawing to the
Eare, he greatly prayseth, as a way
whereby men shoot stronger, lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and deeper; drawing therefore
to the Eare, is better then to draw
to the Breast: and now I call it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
my minde, I neuer read in any
Author whatsoeuer, of any other
kinde of shooting, then drawing
with a mans hand eyther to the
Breast, or to the Eare, and yer I
haue turned ouer all <hi>Homer, Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotus,</hi>
and <hi>Plutarch,</hi> which makes

me not a little wonder, how and
when <hi>Crossebowes</hi> first came up, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they are so forgotten by the
best <hi>Historians: Leo</hi> the Emperor
would haue his Souldiers draw
quickly inward, affirming it made
a Shaft flye fast: but in shooting at
Prickes, hasty drawing is neyther
sure nor comely. Therefore to
draw easily and vniformely, (that
is to say) not wagging your hand
vpward nor downeward, but still
obseruing one time and fashion,
vntill you come to the Ridge or
shouldring of the Head, is best
both for profit, skill and Comely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>

may be perceiued better in a mans
mind and imagination, when it is

the Shaft both approacheth to the

so quicke and hard, that no gyrd

soft and gentle, that the Shaft flye
not as if it were sent out of a Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>case:
The meane betwixt both these
(which is perfect loosing) is not
so hard to be followed in shooting,
as it is hard to be described in tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching:
If you will shoot fayre, in
Loosing you must take heed of hit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

sufficiently this Theame
of faire shooting, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth
nothing now but shooting
streight, and keeping a length, to
make a man hit the marke, which is

to shoot streight, or keepe a length,

knowledge in the wind and
Weather, therefore I will ioyne
them together, and discoursing of
each in their proper places, shew
what belongs to the keeping of a
length, and what to shooting
streight.</p>
            <p>The greatest enemies to shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
are the winde and the weather,
by which true keeping a length is
chiefly hindred, which accident, if
it were not, men by ordinary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
might be brought to
wonderfull neare shooting. For it
is no maruaile if the little poore
shaft, being sent alone so high into
the ayre amidst the rage of wind
and weather, one blast hurling it
one way, and another, another. It
is I say, no maruaile if it both loose
the length, &amp; misse the place where
the Shooter had thought to haue
found it. Greater matters then
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:12226:83"/>
Shooting are vnder the rule of the
weather, and will of the winde; as
sayling on the Seas, and things of
like nature, and as in Sayling the
chiefest poynt of a good Master, is
to know all tokens, which belong
to the change of weather, and the
course of the Windes, that thereby
he may with more safety come to
the Hauen; euen so the best pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
of a good Shooter, is to
know the Nature of the Windes
with him &amp; against him, by which
he shall sooner hit the Marke. Wise
Sea-masters, when they cannot
win the best Hauen, are glad of the
next that is good; and Shooters, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they cannot hit the marke,
will be glad, and labour to come
as neare as they can. All things in
this World, are imperfect and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constant,
therefore let euery man
acknowledge his owne weaknesse,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:12226:84"/>
and onely glorifie him which is all
perfection. The Saylor that put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
forth in all weathers, seldome
escapes Shipwracke, and the Shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which maketh no difference of
Seasons, but holds all alike, shall
neyther boast of winnings nor of
vertue. Little Boates and thinne
Boards, cannot indure the rage of
Tempests, and weake Bowes and
light Shafts, cannot stand in a rough
Wind. And belieue it, what Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
soeuer shooteth ignorantly,
considering neyther fayre weather
nor foule, true or false standing,
Nocking, Feather, nor Head, Draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nor Loosing, nor yet any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe;
shall alwayes shoot short and
gone, wide and farre off, and neuer
come neare, except by chance hee
stumble on the Marke; For Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
is nothing else, but absolute
Blindnesse.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:12226:84"/>A skilfull Archer will first with
diligent vse and marking the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
learne to know the Nature of
the Wind, and will with wisedome
measure in his mind, how much it
will alter his shoot either in length
keeping, or in streight shooting; &amp;
so with changing his standing, or
taking another Shaft which hee
knoweth to bee fitter for his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
eyther because it is lower
feathered, or else of a better wing,
will so handle with discretion his
Shoot, that he will seeme rather to
haue the weather vnder his rule by
such care and circumspection, then
the Weather to rule his Shaft by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
sodaine changing. Therefore
in shooting, there is as much diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
betwixt an Archer that is a
good Weather-man, and him that
knoweth nor obserueth any thing,
as is betwixt a blind-man and him
that can see.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:12226:85"/>Moreouer, a perfect Archer must
seriously learne to know the sure
flight of his Shafts, that he may be
bold alwayes to trust them: Next,
he must learne by continuall expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
to know all kind of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
the signes when it will come,
the Nature when it is come, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersity
and alteration when it chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth,
and the decrease and dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
when it ceaseth: These things
thus knowne and obserued, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
shoot diligently pondred, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
ought our Archer to compare the
Weather and his Footing together,<note place="margin">Of Foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</note>
and with discretion measure them,
so that whatsoeuer the Weather
shall take away from his Shoot,
the same shall just footing restore
againe; This poynt well knowne,
and discreetly handled, bringeth
more profit and commendations
to the Archer, then any other se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:12226:85"/>
obseruation whatsoeuer.</p>
            <p>He that will know perfectly the
Wind and Weather, must put dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
betwixt times, and seasons,
for diuersitie of times cause the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersity
of weather. As in the whole
yeare there are foure diuersities of
times, the <hi>Spring,</hi> the <hi>Summer,</hi> the

these, both alter the weather and
change a mans Bow and Strength,
and to know that this is so, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
for an Archer, and not to
search the cause why it should
be so, for that is the office of the
learned.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XX. Principall Obseruations from
the Time of the
yeare.</head>
            <p>IN considering the time of the
year, a wise Archer will follow
a good Seaman; In winter and
rough weather, small Boates and
little Pinkes for sake the Seas. And
at one time of the yeare, no Gallyes
come abroad. So likewise, weake
Archers vsing but small and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Shafts, with Bowes of little
pith, must be content to giue place
for a time; yet I speake not this to
discourage any weake Shooter, for
as there is no Shippe better then a
Gally in a soft and calme Sea, so
no man shooteth more comely or
nearer his marke, then some weake
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:12226:86"/>
Archers doe in a fayre and cleare
day.</p>
            <p>Thus you see euery good Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
must know, not onely what
Bow and Shafts are fittest for him
to shoote withall, but also what
times and seasons are meetest for
him to shoote in. And truely in
all other Matters, and amongst all
the degrees &amp; estates of men, there
is no man that doth anything more
discreetly for his commendations,
or more profitable for his owne
aduantage, then he which doth and
will know perfectly for what mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
Action and time he is most apt
and fit; And here (were it not vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
from the discourse I haue in
hand) I could enter into a large
field of inuection, against those
which onely labour to struggle to
turmoyle themselues in those mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
and affaires which are neither
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:12226:87"/>
fit for their capacities nor conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to their bringing vp; but <hi>Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thius
Aurem vellet,</hi> I will turne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
to the Action of Shooting, in
which I will perswade all wise
Archers, alwayes to haue their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
fit and obedient for their
owne strength, and then euermore
to waite and attend for such time,
weather and seasons, as is most a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
with the action they goe
about: Therefore, if the weather
be too violent and vnfit for your
shooting, leaue of for that day and
attend a better Season, For he is a
Foole that will not goe when Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
driueth.</p>
            <p>Yet to make some larger dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription
of the weather concerning
shooting, I would haue you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
(as I told you before) that
in the whole yeare, the <hi>Spring, Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
Fall,</hi> and <hi>Winter;</hi> and in one
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:12226:87"/>
day, the <hi>Morning, Noone, After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone,</hi>
and <hi>Euening,</hi> altereth the
course of the weather, the pith of
the Bow, and the strength of the
man: And in euery one of these the
weather altereth; as sometimes
windie, sometimes calme; one
while cloudy, another cleare, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
hot, sometimes cold; the
wind sometimes moyst and thicke,
sometimes, dry and smooth, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>A little winde in a misty day
stoppeth a shaft more then a good
whistling wind in a cleare day; nay
I haue seene (when there hath bin
no wind at all) the ayre so Misty
and thicke, that both the markes
haue beene wonderfull great. And
once I heard in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> the
down-markeat Tweluescore-prick,
for the space of three weekes was
thirteenescore and an halfe, and
into the wind (not being very great
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:12226:88"/>
a great deale aboue foureteene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score.</p>
            <p>The wind is sometimes plaine vp
and downe, which commonly is
most certaine and requireth least
knowledge or circumspection, so
that a meane Shooter with meane
furniture (if he can shoote home)
may make shift to doe well.</p>
            <p>A side-winde, tryeth a good Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
and good Furniture, for some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
it bloweth a loft, sometime
low by the Ground, sometime it
bloweth by blasts &amp; sodaine gusts,
and sometime continueth all in one
manner, sometime a quarter wind
with him, &amp; more &amp; again, as much
against him; all w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>, by a man cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
vp a little light grasse or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
by his owne experience, shall
easily finde out. To see the wind
it is impossible, the nature of it is so
fine and subtill, but by carefull ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:12226:88"/>
a world of experience
may be gathered; especially in a
Snow wherein one may perceiue,
that the wind goeth by streames
and not whole together, and in this
Obseruation, though the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
will breed in a man a greater
admiration at the Nature of the
winde, then cunning in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the winde; yet thereby he
shall learne, that it is no wonder at
all, though the best Archers loose
their length in shooting, seeing the
wind is so variable in blowing.</p>
            <p>The Master of a Ship, be he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er
so Skilfull, may by the vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainety
of weather loose both life
and goods; no wonder then if a
good Archer, by the selfe same
wind, so variable in it owne nature,
and so insensible to our nature,
loose not onely a Shoote, but a
Game.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="154" facs="tcp:12226:89"/>The more deceiuable the Wind
is, the more care must the Archer
haue of those beguilings; hee that
doth mistrust, is seldome ouer-rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched:
for although hee cannot at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
to that which is best, yet hee
will be sure to auoyd that which is
the worst.</p>
            <p>Againe, besides these <hi>Winds,</hi> you
must take heed, if at any time you
see any Cloud appeare and gather
by little and little against you; or
if a shower of Raine bee approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,
for then the driuing of the
Weather and the thickening of the
Ayre will increase your Marke,
but when the Shower is gone, and
all things cleere and calme, the
Marke will be as it was at the first,
and you are to alter your shooting
new againe.</p>
            <p>You must also take heed (when
you shoot) whether one of the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:12226:89"/>
Markes or both, standeth a little
short, or vnder the couert of an
high Wall, for there you may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
be beguiled, as thus; If you
take Grasse, &amp; cast it vp to see how
the Wind stands, many times you
will suppose to shoot downe the
Wind, when you shoot cleane a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Wind, &amp; there is a strong
reason for it; because the Wind
which commeth against you, at the
wall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> reboundeth backe againe, and
whirleth euen to the Pricke, and
sometimes much further; and then
turneth againe, euen as a violent
water doth against a Rocke, or any
other high Brey; which example
of water, though it be more sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to a mans eyes, yet it is not
more true then this of the Wind:
Insomuch, that the casting vp
grasse (which should be a tel troth)
will flye that way, which indeed is
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:12226:90"/>
the longer way, and so easily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
the Archer which is not heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
            <p>To preuent this inconuenience,
it is good for you when you come
in the midst, betweene the Marks,
where the field is most open, and
the Wind at greatest liberty, and
there to cast vp eyther a Feather, or
some light Grasse, and know how
the Wind standeth, which done, to
hye to the Pricke with all speed
possible, &amp; according as you found
the Wind in the Mid-way, so to
frame your shoot at the Marke.</p>
            <p>Take heed also, when you shoot
neare the Sea-coast, although you
are two or three miles from the
Sea, for there (if you be diligent to
marke) you shall espy in the most
cleere day, wonderfull alterations,
which cause strange effects in shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting:
And as thus neare the Sea,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:12226:90"/>
so likewise take heed when you
shoot neare any Riuer side, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
if it ebbe and flow, for if then
you obserue the Tide, the weather
and accidents proceeding from
them, you can hardly be a looser.
And thus (according to my weake
knowledge) I haue shewed you the
nature of the Wind and Weather,
wherein if any man find eyther de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
or insufficiency, I shall intreat
him to amend it out of his owne
much better Experience; conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the Chapter with this admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition,
of which I spake before,
that after the knowledge of the
weather thus attained, that then our
Archer take heed to his Standing,
that hee may thereby win as much
in the Ground, as hee lost by the
Weather.</p>

and Errors.</head>
            <p>TOuching the giuing of Ayme
I cannot tell well what to
say, onely that in a strange
place, it taketh away all occasion
of foule play, which is the onely
commendations it can require:
But in my Iudgement, it hindereth
the knowledge of Shooting, and
maketh men more negligent; which
eclipseth the former glory; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
it (as men would haue it) vse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
yet (though Ayme bee giuen
neuer so) you must trust to your
owne skill, for you cannot take
Ayme at another mans Shoot, nor
at your owne neyther; because the
Weather will alter in a minute, and
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:12226:91"/>
that sometimes at one Marke, and
not at the other; and will trouble
your Shaft in the Ayre, when you
can perceiue no Wind on the
ground, as I haue seene many shafts
doe, which haue tumbled aloft in a
very faire day; There may be faults
also in Drawing and Loosing, and
many things else, which are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in the keeping of a just length;
which though your Ayme be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
so certaine, yet your error may
be vndiscouered: therefore make
vse of your Ayme and your Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
by a serious discourse with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
your selfe, and reconciling them
by the ayde of your owne experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
make them both vsefull and
profitable: This I haue brought in
as a Parenthesis, not so much for
the validity, as that I would not
leaue any thing forgotten.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XXII. Of taking true Standing, that is
aduantagious.</head>
            <p>THe next thing to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the Weather, is
perfect Footing, or taking a
true aduantagious standing: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
in a side Wind, you must stand
somewhat crosse into the wind, for
so you shall shoot the furer; when
you haue taken yuour footing, then
looke vpon your shaft, that neyther
wet nor earth be left vpon it, for
that will make it loose the length;
looke also on the head, lest it haue
had any stripe at the last Shoot, for
a stripe against a stone, many times
will both spoyle the head, crooke
the Shaft, and hurt the Feather; the
least of all which, will make a man
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:12226:92"/>
loose his length: which to repaire,
and for the auoydance of these ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
euils, which happen euery
shoot, I would haue our Archer to
carry by his side, a fine, short, close
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pact powch, in which he should
haue a Fyle, a Stone, a Hurfish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skin,
and a cloth to wipe his shafts
cleane vpon euery occasion; These
things must a man carefully looke
vnto, euer when he taketh vp his
Shaft, he must also take heed, that
the head be not made too smooth,
for that will make the Arrow flye
too farre, the meane therefore, is
best proportion; the next to these
things, followeth the Bow, the
handling whereof, I haue handled
already; as for Nocking, Drawing
and Loosing, they are not vndiscus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
I will but therefore rub your
memory ouer with this Precept,
that to looke at the head of your
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:12226:93"/>
Shaft at the Loose, is the best help
for keeping a length, yet some are
of opinion, that it hindereth excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
shooting, because a man hath
then no certainty of shooting
streight, chiefly in that he beholds
not his Marke, but for mine owne
part, were I to shoot at a Lyne, and
not at a Marke; I would alwayes
looke at my Arrowes end. But of
this I will speake more in the next
Chapter, and now conclude, that
who so marketh his Weather dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently,
keepes his Standing justly,
holds the Nocke truly, drawes and
looseth equally, &amp; keeps his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe
certainely, can neuer misse his
length.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XXIIII. Of Shooing streight, and the
Helpes.</head>
            <p>TOuching the Art to shoot
streight, I will first shew
you what Lessons old Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
haue found to attaine there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto,
and then, what wayes are best
to accomplish the same.</p>
            <p>As the Weather belongeth chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the keeping a length, yet a
side-wind appertaineth to shooting
streight; and the nature of the
Pricke also, is to shoot streight; The
length or shortnesse of the Marke,
is alwayes vnder the Rule of the
weather, yet there is something in
the Marke, worthy to bee marked
of an Archer.</p>
            <p>If the Pricke stand on a plaine
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:12226:94"/>
streight ground, they are the best
to shoote at; If the marke stand on
an hill side, or the ground be vne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
with hollownes and turning
wayes betwixt the markes, a mans
eye will take that to be streight w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ch
is crooked. The experience of this
thing, is seene in painting and other
Arts, where crookedlinesse appeare
streight by shadowes: But to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
the chiefe cause why a man
cannot shoot, is because they looke
at their Shaft, which fault com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
for want of instruction when
a man is young; for he that learnes
to shoote by himselfe, being afraid
to pull the shaft out of the Bow,
looks still at his Arrow; And cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
confirmeth this Errour, as it
doth many other, and men conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
longer in this fault, because it
hath so good a vertue in the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
of a length, therefore to keepe
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:12226:94"/>
this fault and yet shoote streight,
Some Archers haue found out this
Inuention, to espie a tree, or an hill
beyond the marke, or else to haue
some notable thing betwixt the
markes on which he might fixe his
eye &amp; his hand: And, that this is so,
there was once an excellent Archer
which tooke all his implements,
his Quiuer and other necessaries &amp;
layd them in the mid-way betwixt
the markes, which the by-standers
supposed he did for safety sake, but
the end of his drift was to make
him shoote streight; there be other
Archers which will espy a marke
a Bow wide off the pricke, and then
place himselfe on that hand the
pricke is on; which thing, how
much good it doth a man, he will
hardly bel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cue, that doth not proue
it.</p>
            <p>Others, and they no meane Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:12226:95"/>
chers, in drawing looke at the mark
vntill they come almost to the
head, then they looke at the shaft,
but at the very loose, with a second
sight, they find their marke againe.
But this way, and all the other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
rehearsed, are but shifts and
fooleries and not to be imitated in
shooting streight, the onely way
worthy pursuit is alwayes to haue
your eye vpon your marke, and as
I hold, it is the readiest and easiest
way, to come to shoote streight,
chiefly if it be practised in youth,
and confirmed in elder age.</p>
            <p>Now there is yet a scruple in
mens minds, which is the best way
to looke at the marke; as whether
betwixt the Bow and the string, or
aboue or beneath the hand, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other wayes beside. But it is
not much materiall, which way a
a man lookes at his marke, if it va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:12226:95"/>
not from comely shooting, the
diuersity of mens standing and
drawing, causeth diuers men to
looke at their markes diuers wayes,
yet they all leade a mans hand to
shoote streight, if nothing else
stoppe; so that comelinesse is the
onely iudge of best looking at the
Marke. Some men wonder, why in
casting a mans eye at the Marke, the
hand should goe streight: But sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
if he considered the nature of a
a mans eye, he would not wonder
at it: For this I am certaine of,
that no seruant to his Master, no
child to his Father is so obedient,
as euery joynt and piece of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
is to doe, whatsoeuer the Eye
bids. The Eye is the guide, the
ruler, and the succourer of all the
other parts; the hand, the foot, and
other members, dare doe nothing
without the Eye, as doth appeare in
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:12226:96"/>
the night, or darke Corners.</p>
            <p>The Eye is the very Tongue
wherewith wit and reason doth
speake to every part of the body,
and the wit doth not so soone fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisie
a thing by the Eye, as every
part is ready to follow, or rather
preuent the bidding of the Eye.
This is plaine in many things, but
most euident in Fence and fighting,
(for as I haue heard men say) there
every part standing in feare to haue
a blow, runnes to the eye for helpe,
as Infants doe to the Mother;
the foote, the hand, and all
waite vpon the Eye. If the eye bid
the hand either beare off, or strike,
or the foote either goe forward, or
backward, it doth so. And that
which is most wonder of all, the
one man looking stedfastly at the
other mans Eye and not at his hand,
will e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>en as it were read in his eye,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:12226:96"/>
where he purposeth to strike next;
for, the eye is not any thing else,
but a certaine window for wit to
shoote out her head at.</p>
            <p>This wonderfull worke of God,
in making all the members so obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
to the Eye, is a pleasant thing
to remember, and looke vpon;
therefore, an Archer may be sure in
learning to looke at his mark when
he is young, alwayes to shoote
streight. The things that hinder a
man which looketh at his mark to
shoot streight, be these; Aside wind,
a Bow eyther too strong or too
weake, an ill arme, when a feather
runneth on the Bow too much, a
bigge brested-Shaft for him that
shooteth vnder-hand, because it
will hobble; a little brested-shaft
for him that shooteth aboue the
hand, because it will start: a paire
of winding prickes, and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:12226:97"/>
things, which you shall marke
your selfe, and as you know them,
so learne <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o amend them. If a man
would leaue to looke at his shaft,
and learne to looke at his marke, he
may vse this way, which a good
shooter told me once that he did.
Let him take his Bow in the night,
and shoot at two Lights, and there
he shall be compelled to looke al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
at his marke, and neuer at
his shaft. This way once, or twice
vsed, will cause him forsake look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at his shaft, yet let him take
heed of setting his shaft in the
Bow.</p>
            <p>Thus you see, to shoote streight
is the least Mastry of all, if a man
order himselfe thereafter in his
youth, and as for keeping a length,
I am sure, the rules which I gaue
will neuer deceiue; so that there
shall lacke nothing, either of hit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:12226:97"/>
the marke alwayes, or else ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
neare shooting, if the fault be
not only in your owne selfe, which
may come two wayes; either in
hauing a faint heart, or courage, or
else with suffering your selfe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uermuch
to be led by affection; if
a mans minde faile him, the body,
which is ruled by the mind, can
neuer doe his duty; if lacke of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
were not, men might doe
more Maisteries, then they doe, as
doth appeare, in Leaping and Vaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>
            <p>All affections, and especially
Anger, hurt both minde and body,
the mind is blinded thereby, and if
the mind be blind, it cannot rule
the body aright. The body both
Bloud and Bone, as they say is
brought out of his right course by
anger, whereby a man lacketh his
right strength, and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:12226:98"/>
not shoote well. If these things be
auoided (whereof I will speake no
more, because they belong not
properly to shooting) and all the
precepts which I haue giuen, dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
marked, no doubt any man
shall shoote, as well, as euer any
man did.</p>
            <p>This Discourse handled by
me (as I know well,) not perfitly,
yet as I suppose truly, the world
must take in good parte,
wherein, if diuers things
doe not altogether
please, yet it may
pardon.</p>
