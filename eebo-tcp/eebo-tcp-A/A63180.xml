            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>May it pleaſe your Lordſhip, and you Gentlemen of this Jury, Mr. <hi>Speke</hi> and Mr. <hi>Braddon,</hi> theſe two Gentlemen, are accuſed of as High Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy as ever has or could well happen in our days, of throwing the Murther of a Perſon that killed himſelf, upon the Government. And I muſt acquaint you, their deſign was of an higher Nature than barely that; for this Gentleman, my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> was committed to the <hi>Tower</hi> for the late Plot, and being ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, when he had killed himſelf there, that was more than a thouſand Witneſſes to open the eyes of the People, and confirm the belief of the Conſpiracy: And one would have thought, after that there had been an end of the deſign, that theſe Proteſtant Gentlemen, as they call themſelves, were carrying on; when the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> a Perſon of that Quality and Worth, ſhould go to Murther him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon the ſenſe of what he was Guilty of. So that the Deſign, Gentlemen, was to ſtifle the Plot, and at the ſame time they muſt throw this ill thing that the Earl had committed upon himſelf, upon the Government, that, Gentlemen, was the main diſgrace in order to ſtifle that great Evidence of the Plot. And Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> muſt of his own head, not being put on by any of the Friends of the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> who were all very ſenſible the Earl had done this Fact, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted this Murther upon himſelf; but I ſay, he out of a true Principle to manage the Proteſtant Cauſe as they call it, but indeed it was the Plot, he becomes the Proſecutor of this buſineſs, and you will find him by the proofs in the Caſe, a man of many like Projects. For you will find him value himſelf upon theſe Titles, That he is the Proſecutor of the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s Murther, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventor of the Proteſtant Flails, an Inſtrument, I ſuppoſe Gentlemen you have all heard of.</p>
               <p>Now Gentlemen, to make this appear to the World, Letters are ſent into all Parts of <hi>England</hi> of this Bruit and Report. He himſelf goes about to find Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; for it was ſo great a truth, and there was ſuch a plain proof that the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> had killed himſelf, that he muſt labour it to get Evidence. And he goes about it accordingly, and at length he meets with a little Child of Twelve years of Age, and he prepares for him all with his own hand-writing, a Depoſition, which is a feigned Story all of it, and in every part of it will appear to be falſe, and there he mightily ſolicits this young Boy to ſign it. He comes to his Fathers Houſe, carries him in a Coach, forces him away, and forces him to ſign this Paper that he had thus prepared for him, all of his own invention and writing; and with the like confidence as he appears here, (for ſo he does appear with very great Confidence, as you may obſerve) he atteſts it himſelf. And Gentlemen, we ſhall ſhew you, that here up and down the Town he makes it his common diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, what he was in hand with, and makes his boaſt of himſelf to be the Proſecutor of the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s Murther, and he had as good a Confederate as himſelf, Mr. <hi>Speke,</hi> and he having an Intereſt in the Country, whither the news muſt be ſent all abroad, and Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> muſt go to pick up Evidence, I know not where a great way off of a Murther committed in the <hi>Tower.</hi> We ſhall prove to you, he had Letters Miſſive and recommendatory from Mr. <hi>Speke</hi> to a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man with whom Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> was to adviſe: for they looked upon it to be as dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous an Enterprize almoſt as the Plot it ſelf, as indeed it was; therefore they muſt be wary, and Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> is adviſed to go by a wrong name, ſo this Mr. <hi>Speke</hi> and <hi>Braddon</hi> were to carry on and make up this Tragi-Comedy, for I can call it nothing elſe, for the ridiculouſneſs as well as the dangerouſneſs of the Deſign. The report was to be that this Murther of the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> was committed by the Officers that attended my Lord, and to fall out in time when his Majeſty was
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41249:4"/>
in the <hi>Tower,</hi> as if the King himſelf had a hand in it. We ſhall trace it in all the parts of it by ſeveral Witneſſes, and hope you will make them an Example, firſt by finding them Guilty, and the Court afterwards by a ſevere Puniſhment for ſuch a villainous practice, to ſcandalize the Government with the Murther of a Noble Peer. We ſhall begin with ſhewing you the Inquiſition, or rather firſt with the Convictment of the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> for High-Treaſon, becauſe that is ſaid in the Record by way of inducement.</p>

               <p>How came you to be frighted then, and to be unwilling to hear of that matter, and to tell him, you thought it might be prejudicial to him and Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>?</p>

               <p>I told him I had ſeen the Coroners Inqueſt, where it was proved, that the Razour lay in ſuch a place; therefore I deſired they would not ſpeak to me of any ſuch matter, and I deſired Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> not to proceed in it, for you may do your ſelf, and Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> too, ſome prejudice.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>Why ſo? why might it not be thrown out after it was found in the place where the Inquiſition ſays? Thou art a wonderful cautelous man, Where is the danger of the Report, of a Razour being thrown out of a window? there muſt be ſomething more in it, if we could but get it out of him.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Evans.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>That is all I can ſay my Lord. It was an Accident that they came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my company. And I tell you the manner and the occaſion. That Perſon that brought me the Warrant, ſaying to Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> that I was below, Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> hearing my name named, comes down with Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> for he had told Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> I was related to him, and they both came to the <hi>Coffee-Houſe,</hi> and there they began to diſcourſe about this matter.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> began thus. Says he, Mr. <hi>Evans,</hi> this Gentleman has been at my Houſe to examin my Son concerning a Report that is ſpread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad concerning a Razour that was thrown out of the Window of the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s Lodgings, that morning he cut his Throat. I hearing of that, ſaid I, Gentlemen, I have read the Coroners Inqueſt that is in Print, and it is otherwiſe declared there: And therefore let there be no diſcourſe of any ſuch matter, for I believe no ſuch thing. And ſaid I, to that Gentleman, Mr. <hi>Braddon,</hi> pray for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear medling in any ſuch thing, for Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> is a poor man, and has divers Children, he may be ruined, and you likewiſe may be ruined your ſelf, if you proceed any further in it.</p>

               <p>And with your Favour too Sir. Pray will you hear me, I have heard you a great while I am ſure to no purpoſe. But conſider with your ſelf, and pray be pleaſed to reconcile what you ſay now with what you ſaid at firſt if you can. You ſay firſt of all <hi>Edwards</hi> and <hi>Braddon</hi> came to me to the Cuſtom-houſe, and found me out at the Coffee-houſe, and that <hi>Edwards</hi> ſhould ſay, Some body had been with his Son, in order to examine him about a Razor that was thrown out of my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s Window, and that you immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cried out, Have a care of that, for that contradicts the Inquiſition that I have ſeen in Print, which declares as though the Razor was found in the Room. And after that you ſay, It was that you ſaw the Inquiſition when <hi>Hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel</hi> came down with <hi>Braddon,</hi> and you told him of the Report at the Cuſtom-houſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> How came you if you had not ſeen the Inquiſition till then, to give out ſuch words at the Cuſtom-houſe, Have a care of medling with that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that contradicts the Inquiſition?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Evans.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>My Lord, This was ſeveral days before that?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, my Lord, this Diſcourſe at <hi>Wantſtead</hi> was before that at the Cuſtom-houſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Wallop.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>This that he now ſpeaks of is an Anſwer to Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi>'s Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, which was about a Diſcourſe that paſſed before this other at the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom-houſe. This that he ſpeaks of the Diſcourſe at a Coffee-houſe was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, but indeed he firſt ſpake of it; but theſe were two diſtinct matters at ſeveral times. This laſt of the Cuſtom-houſe was, when he had made the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of the Boy, as that Witneſs ſays.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>Therefore I think it was fit to explain it, for it looked very inconſiſtent before, what thou ſaidſt at firſt, and what thou ſaiſt now; but if thou telleſt me thy <hi>Eſſex</hi> matter was before thy Coffee-houſe matter, it is well, otherwiſe the matter I aſſure you looked very ill.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>Take the Times, my Lord, and you will ſee he does ſpeak very notably. The 13<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>July</hi> my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> murdered himſelf, the 14<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>July</hi> the Inquiſition was taken before the Coroner, pray what was the day
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:41249:7"/>
that <hi>Hatſel</hi> and this Gentleman came down to you to <hi>Eſſex?</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Evans.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>I can't tell that, Sir, truly; but it was before this matter of the Examination of the Boy.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>But pray let me ask you one Queſtion, If your matter about the Inquiſition in the Countrey was before the matter of your cautious Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe at the Cuſtom-houſe, how came you to tell them, I heard this Report of a Razor thrown out of the Window, that morning the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> cut his own Throat?</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> reported this ſame thing that very ſame morning to me and ſeveral others at the Cuſtom-houſe-Key.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſt.</speaker>

               </speaker>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Hatſel</hi> gave the occaſion by pulling out the Inquiſition.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>Pray, Sir, make your Obſervations anon, let the King's Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel go on with their Evidence.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>What Diſcourſe had Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> with you then at that time when <hi>Hatſel</hi> came down with him to your Houſe you ſay, and pulling out the Inquiſition you read it, and made Anſwer, You heard at Cuſtom-houſe-Key ſuch a Report that very morning the Earl murdered himſelf.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Evans.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> was walking up and down the Room, I did not ſpeak it to him, but I ſpake it to Mr. <hi>Hatſel,</hi> but I believe <hi>Braddon</hi> over-heard and took notice of it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Juſt. Withins.</speaker>
               <p>Did he concern himſelf about it?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Evans.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>No, not much, I did not hear him ſay any thing, but he walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up and down the Room.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>Now after all this Diſcourſe of the matter, for ought I can un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, the matter is but this: He ſays, <hi>Edwards</hi> before the meetings either at his Houſe in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> or at the Coffee-houſe by the Cuſtom-houſe, reported to him, as tho' the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> had not murdered himſelf, but ſome body elſe had done it for him. And this was reported at the Cuſtom-houſe that morning the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> cut his own Throat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and he hearing this Report at the Cuſtom houſe at that time, afterwards comes <hi>Braddon</hi> and <hi>Hatſel</hi> to his Houſe into <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and after <hi>Hatſel</hi> had ſhew'd him the Paper of the Inquiſition in Print, he ſaid, I heard ſome Diſcourſe from Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> at the Cuſtom-houſe of a quite other nature, and then he ſays, <hi>Braddon</hi> and <hi>Edwards</hi> came to the Coffee-houſe, and there it was he deſired them not to talk of that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for, ſaid he, that contradicts the Inquiſition I ſaw before. This is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of what he ſaid.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>And hereby it does appear, that <hi>Braddon,</hi> and <hi>Evans,</hi> and <hi>Edwards,</hi> and <hi>Hatſel,</hi> are all of a Gang.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>Have you the Information he gave in to the Secretary, <hi>Mr. Att. Gen.</hi> That that was given before the Councel?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, 'tis much the ſame with what he hath ſaid now.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Evans.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Yes, my Lord, 'tis <hi>verbatim,</hi> as I have declared now.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>Only this other part of <hi>Hatſel</hi> and the meeting in <hi>Eſſex</hi> was ſpoken of ſince, that was not declared before.</p>

            <sp>

               </speaker>
               <p>No, my Lord, that I did not ſpeak of, becauſe I was not exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined about it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>That was part of the Secret.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>No, it was common Diſcourſe with me. And I did not think any thing of it, what Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> ſaid at the Cuſtom-houſe, was ſpoken to a great many others as well as me, and the people ſeemed to be ſurpriſed with an accompt of the thing at the firſt news of my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s death.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:41249:7"/>
And if I had thought it material I could have brought a great manny that were by then; but <hi>Mr. Edwards</hi> is here brought himſelf, I ſuppoſe he will not deny it.</p>

               <p>Look you, Sir, you ſay that very morning my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> killed himſelf, <hi>Mr. Edwards</hi> diſcourſed, and made this Report to you at the Cuſtom-houſe, pray tell what the diſcourſe was? what he ſaid to you? and then tell us what time of day it was?</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Evans.</speaker>
               <p>To the beſt of my remembrance it was about eleven a Clock; there were ſeveral perſons ſtanding together, among the reſt Captain <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and ſome of the Searchers, and <hi>Mr. Edwards</hi> was there, and ſaid he, I am informed from home, That my Boy has been at home, and given an accompt to my Wife, that being in the <hi>Tower,</hi> he ſaw a hand throw a Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor out of a Window, and he named my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s Window; and this <hi>Mr. Edwards</hi> did not only tell me, but to a whole Coffee-houſe of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, this matter of fact.</p>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Edwards.</speaker>
               <p>The Report I have already declared before the Council.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Edwards.</speaker>
               <p>The Report of the Boy the 13. of <hi>July</hi> about 10 a Clock, as I was informed by my Family, and by the Boy afterwards by word of mouth, was this, He comes in about 10 a Clock, ſays he, I have been at the <hi>Tower</hi> (to one of his Siſters,) and have ſeen his Majeſty and the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> has cut his throat, and I ſee an hand throw a Razor out of the Window, and one came out of the houſe, a Maid, or a Woman in a white Hood and a Stuff Coat and took it up, and went in again, and then I heard a noiſe as of murder cryed out. This was the Boys Report, and more than as his Report I can't ſpeak to it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <speaker>Mr. Edwards.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, the younger of them. The two Boys were that morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing going to <hi>Merchant-Taylors</hi> School together as they uſed to do, and by the way hearing the King was in the Tower, this younger Boy that was well acquainted with the Tower, gave his elder Brother the ſlip and went into the Tower, and rambled about from place to place.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>Did not you examine him?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Edwards.</speaker>
               <p>Ay, I did examine him.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>Did not you find that he denyed it again?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Edwards.</speaker>
               <p>No, I did examine him, and I found no denyal of any thing at all that he had reported till <hi>Mr. Braddon</hi> came to make enquiry. Aſſoon as he came to make the enquiry, and <hi>I</hi> underſtood what <hi>Mr. Braddon</hi>'s buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was, <hi>I</hi> begged of him that he would not inſiſt upon it by no means; <hi>I</hi> begged of him as if <hi>I</hi> had begged for my life, but he was ſo zealous in the buſineſs, that nothing would ſatisfie him. And after <hi>I</hi> had told <hi>Mr. Braddon</hi> that which <hi>I</hi> could not deny, which was the Boys Report, <hi>I</hi> left him and went down to the Cuſtom-houſe, and ſome of my Family diſcourſed the Boy at that rate that he began to deny it, and in leſs than half an hours time recollected himſelf and began to own it again, and ſo the Boy was off and on till the time he was before the Council; and to this day he ſeems to ſtand in the denyal, whether he will do it now or no <hi>I</hi> cann't tell.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>Did you acquaint Mr. <hi>Braddon,</hi> That you had found this Boy to be a lying Boy, and detected him in Lyes ſeveral times?</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>May it pleaſe you Sir, I acquainted him with thus much: Said I, Mr. <hi>Braddon,</hi> As I have dealt ingenuouſly with you, to let you know what the Boy's Report was, ſo I muſt likewiſe tell you, that I cannot nor will undertake to aſſert the truth of it, and preſently upon that my Daughters told me, the Boy had many times excuſed his playing Truant by falſe Stories.</p>

               <p>I told him I had it from my Family, who told me the Boy had made ſuch a Report.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Edwards.</speaker>

               <p>I examined my Boy at Dinner, and I found the Boy agreed with the Report of my Daughter, and confirmed it.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Edwards.</speaker>
               <p>Truly I do not remember he ſaid any ſuch thing.</p>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Sol. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>At his firſt coming did your Son ſign his Paper then?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Edwards.</speaker>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Edwards.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, he did not tender a Paper to him to ſign till he had been 2. or 3. times there, as I have heard, it was not tendred the firſt time he came.</p>

            <sp>

               <speaker>Mr. Edwards.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I never was thought otherwiſe, nor I hope never gave any occaſion for ſuch a Thought.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Edwards.</speaker>
               <p>I hope I have done nothing to make your Lordſhip think the contrary.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, thou haſt. Thou didſt nothing but ſhuffle up and down, thou art to conſider thou art upon thy Oath, and muſt anſwer Queſtions plainly.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>Speak the truth, and nothing but the truth, that is all that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of thee; no Court of Juſtice ought to be afraid to hear truth. Let truth come out of Gods Name.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>Did <hi>Mr. Braddon</hi> ever tell you, That he had other Evidence beſides your Son?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Edwards.</speaker>
               <p>I do not remember he ſaid any ſuch thing at his firſt coming.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>I ask you, whether ever he did ſay it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Edwards.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, he did ſay ſo afterwards.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Sol. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>I muſt ask you one Queſtion more, (for I ſee 'tis very difficult to get it out of you) Pray did he tell you, that he had other Evidence beſides your Son, before he ſigned the Paper or after?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Edwards.</speaker>
               <p>It was before, as I take it. I ſpeak to the beſt of my knowledg, my Lord, I can ſay no more.</p>

               <p>If thou haſt a mind to continue the Reputation thou haſt got, as

thou ſaiſt, the way is to anſwer Queſtions, and ſpeak the truth plainly, let it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern whom it will.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Edwards.</speaker>
               <p>I labour to do it, my Lord, to the beſt of my Underſtanding and Capacity.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>I would not have thee ſay a tittle more than the truth, but let the truth come out.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Freke.</speaker>

               <p>That is a terrible thing.

               <p>Then I ask thee, who perſwaded thee to ſign it after that time that thou firſt refuſedſt it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Will. Edwards.</speaker>
               <p>My Mother was afraid to have me ſign it.</p>

               <p>Then I will tell you what he has ſaid exactly. He ſays that <hi>Mr. Braddon</hi> writ it from him; that he writ it in the Room while he was there; that after ſuch time as he had writ it, Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> read it to him: He ſays, that he had carried his Brother to ſhew him the place where he aſſigned that the Razor was found in the Tower, he ſays, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſuch time as the Writing was finiſhed, Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> offered it him to ſign, and he refuſed
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:41249:12"/>
to ſign it, and I asked him the reaſon why, and he ſays becauſe it was falſe; he ſays ſome ſhort time afterwards Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> came to him again.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>Well, the ſame time <hi>Braddon</hi> was at him again, and told him there was no harm in it, and therefore deſired him to ſign it, and becauſe he would not, he would have had his Aunt to have ſigned it; and he ſays, that <hi>Braddon</hi> telling him there was no harm in it, he did ſign it.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Will. Edwards.</speaker>

               <p>What a duſt has ſuch a trivial Report made in the world! Admit the Boy had ſaid any ſuch thing, what an Age do we live in, that the Report of every Child ſhall blow us up after this rate? It would make a body tremble to think what a ſort of people we live among: To what an heat does Zeal tranſport ſome people beyond all reaſon and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety? If ſuch a little Boy had ſaid ſo, 'tis not an half-penny matter, but preſently all the Government is to be libell'd for a Boy, which whether he ſpeaks true or falſe is of no great weight, and he ſwears 'tis all falſe.</p>

Pray, Mr. <hi>Hawkins,</hi> will you acquaint my Lord and the Jury, whether you play'd Truant that morning with this other Boy, and where you were.</p>

The Boy ſaid it was a Lye, and that upon his faith it was not true. Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> knew all this, for he was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in and informed of it; and I believe Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> will remember that he heard the Boy deny it. The whole Examination could not but ſhew that it was an Invention of his, as he ſaid it was to excuſe himſelf for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving plaid Truant that day, and that becauſe he was afraid to go home he invented that Lye. After this Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> as it appears did nevertheleſs purſue this buſineſs.</p>

               <p>I know my Lord that Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> (having been in the Country) came afterwards before the King, and was again Examined upon this matter by which it appeared that he did continue in his purſuit, though he was always informed of the denial the Boy made, and that it was underſtood to be a Lye by the whole Family of the <hi>Edwards</hi>'s, as well as from the denial of the little Boy; for they did confeſs that the Boy uſed to tell Lyes, and one of the Siſters ſaid he had denied it at firſt, but afterwards was brought to ſay it. And if I remember right the words of one of the Siſters were, <hi>BRADDON COMPELLED THE BOY TO SIGN IT.</hi> Thoſe are the words in the Minutes that I took at the Examination, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I believe it was ſo, that the Boy had denyed before to ſign it. But this I only mention as what the Siſter ſaid.</p>

               <p>My Lord, About 5 or 6 days after my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> had murdered himſelf in the Tower, I ſaw Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> at the Secretary's Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, my Lord <hi>Sunderland</hi>'s Lodgings at <hi>White-hall,</hi> with a young Woman, and a Boy about 12 or 13 years old. The Boy was juſt now in Court, I ſaw him there. He came to me, and told me, he had earneſt Buſineſs to ſpeak with my Lord <hi>Sunderland,</hi> That he came from Sir <hi>Henry Capel,</hi> and he told me, he came with an Information, That the Boy had given relating to the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s death. (The Information I believe is in Court.) He gave me the Information, and I read it, and I remember, there was ſomething in the Information of a Razor thrown out of a Window, a bloody Razor thrown out of my Lord <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s Window, and after I had read the Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I told Mr. <hi>Braddon,</hi> I wonder Sir <hi>Henry Capell</hi> had not appeared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in a Matter of that moment, wherein the Reputation of his Family was ſo much concerned, and I took the liberty to tell him, That I believed if Sir <hi>Henry Capell</hi> had thought that to be true, that was contained in that Paper, he would doubtleſs have came to my Lord <hi>Sunderland</hi> himſelf. Thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he told me, That Sir <hi>Henry Capell</hi> had not been well, and did not ſtir abroad. Then I told Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> again, as I very well remember, That I was confident, he had been abroad lately, and had been to wait upon the King, ſince the death of my Lord of <hi>Eſſex.</hi> Then, my Lord, he had little or nothing to ſay to that, but, he ſaid, what he did, he was obliged to do in Conſcience, and out of the Duty he owed to the Memory of my Lord of <hi>Eſſex.</hi> Upon that, my Lord <hi>Sunderland</hi> came by, and I went with him to my Lord <hi>Sunderland,</hi> and he gave him that Paper, as I ſuppoſe, which I read, and my Lord <hi>Sunderland</hi> took the Information, and afterwards Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> was committed in Cuſtody, and then the thing was brought before the King, and the Lords of the Council, which Mr. <hi>Blathwaite</hi> has given you an accompt of.</p>

Whereupon this Informant left his Brother, and went to the Tower to ſee his Majeſty, and his Royal Highneſs. And when this Informant had ſeen his Majeſty and his Royal Highneſs, this Informant about Nine of the Clock in the Morning of the ſame day, went to ſee my Lord <hi>Brandon Gerard</hi>'s Lodgings; and as this Informant was ſtanding almoſt over againſt my Lord <hi>Gerard</hi>'s Lodgings, between the Lord <hi>Gerard</hi>'s, and the late Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s Lodgings, this Informant ſaw a Hand caſt out a bloody Razor out of the ſaid Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s Lodgings. And this Informant was going to take up the ſaid Razor, which he ſaw on the Ground to be bloody, but before this Informant came to the Razor, there came a Maid running out of Captain <hi>Hawley</hi>'s houſe, where the ſaid Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> lodged, and took up the ſaid Razor, which he carryed into the ſaid Captain <hi>Hawley</hi>'s Houſe. And this Informant, believes that it was the ſaid Maid, who he firſt heard cry out Murder. And this Informant further ſaith, That he heard the ſaid Maid, ſay to ſome which were about the Door, after the Murder was cryed. That ſhe did hear the ſaid Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> to groan three times that Morning.

Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> I am under great grief and under a great burthen of Buſineſs in my private Family, whatſoever you have to ſay in the matter, I deſire you would go to a Secretary of State and acquaint him with it.

He went away on a ſudden hence Poſt towards <hi>Marlebrough</hi> to make ſome farther diſcovery, and what he has diſcovered he will give you a full accompt, and of all the Tranſactions hitherto above it.

thought it not amiſs to go and adviſe with you how he had beſt to proceed in it, and I did charge him not to let any body know who he was, that it might not be known that he had been with you; For I would not for the whole World that you ſhould come to any preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice in the leaſt for your kindneſs towards us.

We ſhall end here at preſent to ſee how he has improved his confidence, by what defence he will make to all this proof. Afterwards if there be occaſion, We ſhall give an account of the Earls death, how he murdered himſelf. And for that we have a Cloud of Witneſſes, tho this Gentleman has taken upon him ſo much confidence as to conteſt it.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>May it pleaſe your Lordſhip, and you Gentlemen of the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, I am of Counſel for Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> and Mr. <hi>Speke,</hi> the Defendants here. You ſee what the Iſſue is before you Mr. <hi>Speke</hi> and Mr. <hi>Braddon,</hi> they are in the Information charged, That they did Conſpire together to make the People believe, That whereas the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> murdered himſelf, and ſo it was found by the Inquiſition, yet they would have the People believe, that that Inquiſition was taken unduly, and that they did Conſpire to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure falſe Witneſſes to make theſe things out. Now Gentlemen, the only point that you are to inquire of, is this, Whether theſe two Gentlemen did malitiouſly, factiouſly, and ſeditiouſly ſet theſe things on foot. This Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port that the Earl was murdered, or whether there were ſuch intimations offered to them accidentally and caſually, without officiouſneſs or any of their own ſeeking, that might induce a good man or a wiſe man to follow the buſineſs upon ſuch Information given. For our parts that are for the Defendant we ſay this for our Clients, We are not ſo much to make any men guilty of this Murder, that is not our buſineſs, but to prove our own innocency and fair dealing in this matter. Now Gentlemen, if theſe two Perſons had no inducement to lead them on to this, but did it of their own heads, that is Criminal in them, but if they had that which might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a wiſe and good man though they were much miſtaken, yet they are not to be found Guilty of this offence, that is charged on them. I ſhall leave it Gentlemen to you, who I queſtion not have obſerved the Evidence that has been given, and whoſe proper work it is to make your Judgment upon. But in our defence the ſteps we go are theſe, and we deſire you would pleaſe to obſerve them. Firſt we ſay, that the Report of this Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was the day before, two or three days before, and that very day, ſo
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:41249:17"/>
many Miles diſtant from <hi>London,</hi> that hearing of ſuch a Report we might very eaſily be induced to make ſome inquiry after it; and of this 4 Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces we ſhall give in the Courſe of our Evidence, that this was a great many Miles off <hi>London</hi> talked of at the day, and immediately after the day, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the News could reach thoſe places after the Fact committed. Then we ſhall proceed to thoſe paſſages concerning the Boy, and produce Evidence to ſet forth the true State of that Matter, That this Boy as he ſays himſelf did tell the Family this Story that very day that my Lord murdered himſelf, immediately upon his coming home. Now this Original Story is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be contrived by Mr. <hi>Braddon,</hi> be it true or be it falſe. Then Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> coming into <hi>Eſſex</hi> to Mr. <hi>Evans</hi> houſe at <hi>Wansteed,</hi> there what was ſaid by the Boy was ſpoken of. Then Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> finding this Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Boy, which he had given merely of himſelf, and which contradicted the Inquiſition and put him upon this Inquiry. Now how far this Intimation has weight, and may be an inducement to a good and a wiſe man, as I ſay that we muſt leave to you. But beſides that, there is a Girl a ſtranger to the Boy, that at the ſame time upon the matter, and to this ſame effect and ſubſtance, delivered ſuch an Evidence as might very well ſerve to confirm us in our Inquiry, and this is the Courſe of our Evidence in the ſubſtance of it. And we ſhall apply our ſelves to your Lordſhip and the Jury after the Evidence given, and make our Obſervations upon it, and ſubmit it to you Gentlemen.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>Will your Lordſhip pleaſe to ſpare me one word that is an Objection that we would make from the Record it ſelf. The Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that does recite, That the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> was impriſoned in the Tower, and during his Impriſonment there, cut his own Throat, and became <hi>Felo de ſe.</hi> And that there was an Inquiſition taken before ſuch an one, before <hi>Edw. Farnham</hi> Coroner of the Liberty of the Tower, My Lord, I was not here when the Inquiſition was read, if I had I ſhould have made the Objection then, but this is that I ſay, If we can falſifie that part of the Record, if there be a miſtake there, that is, if <hi>Farnham</hi> was not Coroner then they fail in their proof, and we muſt be found not Guilty, for ſo it is in the Information.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>It is ſaid to be before him as Coroner of the Liberty.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Williams.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Yes, My Lord, They recite that he is Coroner, and that the Inquiſition was taken before him as Coroner, and Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> knowing of it did thus and thus.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Why is he not Coroner?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Williams.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I deſire the Inquiſition may be looked into, I cannot go to contradict the Inquiſition, but my inſtructions only are that he is Deputy Coroner, and if it be ſo they are miſtaken in their Information.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               </speaker>
               <p>Then we can't help it. But there are theſe things, that we ſay to it, one part of the Information is, That we ſhould go about to perſwade the people, that this Inquiſition was not duely taken, another part is, That we did procure falſe Witneſſes to prove it; now what proof is offered as to the matter of perſwading the people, I muſt ſubmit to you, whether it be ſuch as comes up to the Charge in the Information. There is ſome kind of proof, but what it is you ſee. Then for the other Matter which is the procuring falſe Witneſſes, that under favour I think I may affirm, that there is no proof at all of, that Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> or Mr. <hi>Speke</hi> did procure falſe Witneſſes. Gentlemen, we ſhall endeavour to acquit our ſelves of all, if we cannot of all, yet of part, eſpecially that part which ſeems to be the moſt Criminal. And I muſt needs ſay I have not heard
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:41249:18"/>
any Proof of procuring falſe Witneſſes, by either of the Defendants. Then there is a third thing charged, and indeed in the Evidence there is ſomething that looks towards it, That he ſhould go about by Papers and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe to publiſh it, That he was a perſon employed to proſecute the Murder of the Earl of <hi>Eſſex.</hi> Now as to this matter all I ſhall ſay for Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> is this, If he have done ſomething more, it may be by a tranſport of Zeal, than became him, that muſt be ſubmitted how far it is criminal. If he did what did not become a mighty wiſe and diſcreet Man, yet if he did what became a rational Man of ordinary Capacity to do, if he had this Information and ſo many other Informations, and he did ſearch innocently a little into it, if he did not do it Seditiouſly and Factiouſly with an ill mind, we hope there is no ſuch great harm done. And indeed Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, his Mind is to be tryed in this matter. And 'tis an hard matter to try a Man's Mind, <hi>quo animo</hi> a Man did ſuch an Action; that he did it, there is ſome ſort of Evidence, but if he did it not out of an ill Principle and with an evil Intention, then, under favour, we take it he is not Guilty of this Information. And we ſhall endeavour to make it out thus, This Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman hearing of this Report of the Boy, makes his Application firſt to Sir <hi>Henry Capell,</hi> who was a perſon well known to be nearly related to this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Lord, the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and he tells him what Information he had received. Sir <hi>Henry Capell</hi> puts him into an excellent Courſe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires him to go and inform a Secretary of State, and he did ſo, and if he had gone only this way, all that he had done had been innocent. Then the matter is only this; He has gone a little out of the way, and has taken ſome Informations and Examinations in Writing: why thô he has gone a ſtep or two awry, yet if it was with a deſign to prepare the matter, the better for the Secretary, by laying theſe Papers before him, we hope there is no Crime; if we did it not Seditiouſly, but only with an intention, That Mr. Secretary might receive a more clear and full Information; I hope the Jury will acquit us.</p>

               <p>I believe that <hi>Mr. Braddon</hi> in his Proſecution of this matter, went upon the ground of this Report, for he had heard the like Evidence was given in my Lord <hi>Staffords</hi> Tryal, about the News of Sir <hi>Edmondbury Godfreys</hi> being killed, before it was known here what was become of him, and that perhaps might miſlead him if he be miſlead.</p>

               <p>So Sir this Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> came on <hi>Tueſday</hi> following about one or two of the Clock and asked for my Father, and coming, my Siſter <hi>Mary</hi> went to the door and called my Father out to him. When my Father came to him, he told my Father he came from Sir <hi>Henry Capell,</hi> and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs of <hi>Eſſex</hi> to know the Truth of my Brothers Report. So my Father told him the Boy had reported ſuch a thing, but he would not aſſert the Truth of it, for he had been informed by us that the Boy was apt to tell lies to excuſe his playing Truant, ſo the Child was gone to School when Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> came, and when he came home from School they went to the Child, ſaid I, <hi>Billy</hi> will you be ſure to tell me the Truth of this Report, why Siſter ſaid he, will any harm come of it? Nay ſaid I, I do not know, for there has been a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman to inquire about it. So then the Child denied it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Did he know this before he made the Boy ſign the Paper?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sarah Edwards.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, this was on the <hi>Tueſday</hi> after Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> had been firſt there. And I ſpake to him, ſaid I, <hi>Billy</hi> ſay nothing but the Truth be ſure, and don't tell a lie to ſave your Breech. So Sir, as ſoon as ever the Child denied it Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> came in again the ſame day, and coming in found us, my Mother and all of us, daunted hearing the Boy deny it; but he asked the Child and bid him ſpeak the Truth, and told him it was a dreadful thing to be a Liar, and bid him read the fifth of the <hi>Acts,</hi> telling him he would find there two were ſtruck dead for telling of a lie, and ſeveral other ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions that I cannot remember. Upon <hi>Wedneſday</hi> about noon he comes again, and then my Brother did own it again, and he writ down what the Boy owned, and went away, ſaying he would go to Sir <hi>Henry Capell</hi> and the Counteſs of <hi>Eſſex.</hi> And on <hi>Thurſday</hi> he comes again and brings a Paper written over again, not the ſame he writ at our Houſe, and then the Child ſet his hand to it. The Child was ſomething unwilling, ſo ſays he to him, it will be no harm to you, if any danger does come of it, it will come to me and not to you.</p>

               <p>We have got ſuch ſtrange kind of notions now a days, that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth men think they may ſay any thing becauſe they are Counſel. I tell you Mr. <hi>Wallop,</hi> your Queſtions did reflect upon the Government, as though the King had a mind to turn a man out of his employment if he did not ſwear a falſity. What can be a greater reflection than that? But all the matter is, what has been done muſt be avouched and juſtifyed, though it be never ſo ill. But we plainly ſee through all. This was the deſign from the beginning, the King and the Duke of <hi>York</hi> were in the <hi>Tower</hi> at that time, and it muſt be thought and believed that they had deſigned this matter, and ſo then all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple muſt be ruined in caſe they would not ſay the Earl murdered himſelf, tho indeed others had done it.</p>

have you Read the fifth Chapter of the <hi>Acts,</hi> where a man and a woman were ſtruck dead for telling a lie. Sir ſaid the Boy 'tis true, and what I ſaid I will ſpeak it before any Juſtice of peace in the World. And then he asked him what he had reported, and the Boy made a Repetition of what he had ſeen and ſaid before, that he went into the <hi>Tower</hi>: and came to the firſt Row of Houſes that goes along. And at the firſt Houſe he ſaw no body look out at the Window, nor at the ſecond Houſe, but he looked up at the third Houſe, and he took his hand and ſhewed thus, ſaid he I ſaw, a man's hand he did not ſay, but an hand throw a Razor out, of this faſhion, and he imitated it with his hand. Said the Gentleman was it not the wrong Window, or the wrong Houſe? I will not take the thing upon this credit, take your other Brother down that was a bigger Boy than this, and ſays he, go down to the Houſe and ſhew your Brother the Window where you ſaw this. The two Boys went down, and he ſhew'd his Brother the place where he ſaw the hand.—</p>

And this Gentleman, I cannot hit his name right (he is a ſtranger to me) he and Mr <hi>Edwards</hi> went down with the Boy, to ſee whether it were the right window of the Houſe where my Lord died (which where it is I cannot tell any otherwiſe than has been reported, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be one room or two of a floor I don't know;) and when he came up again he called for a Sheet of Paper that he might write from the Boys mouth, and that he might not differ one word from what the Boy had ſaid himſelf. And when I ſaw Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> begin to write I went away, for I thought it may be the Gentleman might expect I ſhould ſet my hand to it as a Witneſs, and I did not deſire any trouble.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I have but one word to add on the behalf of Mr. <hi>Speke,</hi> who is likewiſe joyned in this Information. Truly, Mr. <hi>Speke</hi> is a young Gentleman of ſome quality, his Father is of very good Quality, Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> was of his Acquaintance, and being his Acquaintance, and thus concerned, as you have heard in the Proſecution of this buſineſs; he hearing of theſe Reports, and reſolving to go down into the Country about it, deſired Mr. <hi>Speke</hi> to lend him his Man and his Saddle, for he was going into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Mr. <hi>Speke</hi> inquires what his buſineſs was, thereupon he told him it was to inquire about ſome Perſons that had reported ſomething relating to the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s Death. And being to go into the Country where Mr. <hi>Speke,</hi> who was that Country man, had ſome Acquaintance, upon this he deſires him to write him a Letter to recommend him to ſome Perſons of Credit. He did write that Letter, but was never concerned in this buſineſs, either before or after; and this is the whole of the Caſe, as to this Mr. <hi>Speke.</hi>

            <sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Speke,</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>My Lord, One day, ſometime after Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> had concerned himſelf in this thing, I met him caſually and accidentally, and he was telling me ſomewhat of the matter. And after this, one night as I was going to Bed between 10 and 11 a Clock at night, ſome Body knocked hard at my Door. My man went to the door, and opened the door, and Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> comes in and tells me, he deſired the favour of me, that I would lend him my man, and lend him my Saddle. He being my Acquaintance, and I know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, I was willing to do him that kindneſs; and asking him, whither he went? He told me he was going down to <hi>Marlbrough,</hi> and he told me he had heard that my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s Death was diſcourſed of there in the Country, that day it was done; beſides other things of a Boy, and of a Girl, that could prove ſuch and ſuch things. Said I, this is a thing of great concernment, and I would have you take good advice in it, before you proceed, becauſe otherwiſe it may be a Reflection upon the Government; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſaid I, I would not have you proceed to concern your ſelf further in this thing, but take the Advice and Judgment of ſome prudent and diſcreet Perſon or other, that you may do nothing but what is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Law. I was never at all concerned, nor knew any thing of the buſineſs, but what I heard from Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> at firſt. And before he came into my Chamber, I knew nothing of his coming; and I writ this Letter, becauſe he ſhould not concern himſelf without the Advice of ſome Perſon, that I thought was able to Adviſe him, that he might do nothing that might bring him within the danger of the Law, or reflect upon the Government.</p>

               <p>My Lord, the Reaſon was, becauſe he was not perſonally know to Sir <hi>Robert Atkins</hi>; and for him to go down directly and to have it reported one of ſuch a name came to Sir <hi>Robert Atkins,</hi> who was a man that had retired himſelf into the Country from all publick concern, I thought not ſo well</p>

               <p>My Lord, All I can ſay for Mr. <hi>Speke</hi> is this, He did believe Mr. <hi>Bradden</hi>'s Grounds, as he told him, were probable to go upon, but he
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:41249:29"/>
knew nothing himſelf, and concerned himſelf no further. I hope the Jury will conſider of it, that there is no contrivance proved againſt him.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>My Lord, We have indeed given as great an Evidence as ever was given I think of any Offence. But to clear up the matter, that it was impoſſible for any man, unleſs the moſt maliciouſly and villanouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined againſt the Government and Peace of the Kingdom, that can be, to imagine ſuch a thing, much leſs ſpread ſuch a Report, we will call you two or three Witneſſes to prove, that the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> Murdered himſelf.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis neceſſary, Mr. <hi>Attorney,</hi> I think for you ſo to do, to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the World, tho' to a diſcerning Eye there is enough given from the Evidence this day, to make it appear to be a moſt Malitious and Scandalous Contrivance, to hawke about for every idle Rumor, to pick up Children of ſuch tender years, and make them ſwear any thing to ſerve a turn.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Att. Gen.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>My Lord, We do not call theſe Witneſſes, as if there were any doubt of it in the World.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>But we live in an Age, when Truth paſſes for nothing in the World, and Swearing and Forſwearing is taken for a thing of courſe. Had his Zeal been half ſo much for Truth as it was for Falſhood it had been a commendable Zeal. But when men are ſo zealous and fierce for ſuch vile things as theſe are, 'tis time of my word for the Government to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Att. Gen.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>'Tis not to ſatisfie the Court nor the Jury, who I believe are all of them already ſufficiently ſatisfied, but 'tis to ſatisfie the World, that may have entertained ſome prejudices from this Conſpiracy. Call Mr. <hi>Bomeney</hi> in.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Sol. Gen.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Not as if there were any doubt, whether Mr. <hi>Bradden</hi> were the malicious Inventor of this Report at the beginning, and went down into the Country to ſpread it. The Evidence has been full, and by his own management of his Defence, he has proved it himſelf, and ſeems by his Confidence to juſtifie it. But we ſhall, to give the World ſome ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, call ſome that waited upon the Earl in the <hi>Tower,</hi> and others that ſaw him when dead, that will give a plain Confutation to any thing that could be ſuppoſed, as if my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> had not Murdered himſelf.</p>

               <p>When we were at his Lodging, my Lord uſed to call for a Pen-knife to cut his Nails of his Hands and Feet, and he then had long Nails, and ſaid he to me, give me your Pen-knife to cut my Nails; ſaid I, My Lord, I have none, I came in haſte, but I will ſend to morrow for one; and therefore I ſent our Footman, one <hi>William Turner</hi>; to whom I gave a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Note for Proviſions, and among other things which I writ directions to the Steward to ſend, there was a little line; <hi>Pray ſend a Pen-knife for my Lord.</hi> He brought ſome Proviſions, but he did not bring a Pen-knife on the <hi>Thurſday,</hi> becauſe he ſaid he had none, but he would ſend one the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:41249:29"/>
morrow after; I ſent <hi>William Turner</hi> the Morning after very early, and gave him another little Note for Proviſions; and, among other things, I writ in the Note, <hi>Do not forget the Pen-knife for my Lord.</hi> He went, and when he was in the way, my Lord ſent the Warder to me to call me. I came to my Lord, and my Lord asked, Is the Footman come? Has he brought the Pen-knife? No, my Lord, ſaid I, but I hope he will not ſtay long, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I ſent him early. Then I was turning to come down from the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and I ſaw my Lord walking in the Room and picking of his Nails with the Pen-knife.—</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>How? with a Pen-knife?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Bomeney.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>No, with the Razour that I gave him. For I went to my Lord, and when my Lord asked me, if I had gotten him a Pen-knife. I ſaid, the Footman was not come, but I hoped it would come immediately, becauſe I ſent him early. And I was turning from the Chamber, thinking I had done with my Lord, and my Lord called me again, Harke you, <hi>Bomeney,</hi> ſaid he, I can do it with one of your Razours. My Lord, ſaid I, I will fetch one, ſo I went into my Cloſet and fetched one. And I went to my Lord, and when he had it, he did as if he picked his Nails with it, and was walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Chamber. I looked a little while upon him, and turned out of the Chamber into the Paſſage, where I talked with the Warder, <hi>Ruſſel</hi> his Name was, and when I looked out of the Window, His Majeſty was in the <hi>Tower,</hi> and there was a great buſtle in the Street; and when I had talked a little with the Warder, I went down into my Cloſet again, and at the ſame time that I was in my Cloſet, there came the Footman, and one with him, that brought the Proviſions, and he gave me the Pen-knife, and gave me a little Note, that he had brought with the Proviſions, which, he ſaid, Mr. <hi>Billingsly,</hi> that was our Steward, bid me to ſhew that to my Lord. I took it, and went up to ſhew it to my Lord; I found no body in my Lords Chamber, There was a Cloſet there, in which was a Cloſe Stool; and that I found ſhut, and thinking my Lord was there, I would not diſturb my Lord, but came down again and ſtayed a little while, in ſo much as I thought my Lord by that time might have been come out. I went up again and found no body in the Chamber, but the Cloſet Door ſhut ſtill, I went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Door, and knocked three times and ſaid, My Lord, My Lord, and no body anſwered: Then I looked through the chink of the Door, between the Door and the Wall, and I could ſee blood, and a little part of the Razour. Then I called to the Warder and the People of the Houſe, and they came up and found him there.</p>

               <p>A very little Cloſet, I believe, no wider than that; and the length of a Man, and a Cloſe Stool at the upper end would fill it up My Lord lay all along on his ſide.</p>

And my Lord took the Razour in his Hand, and the Door was open, and he went two or three turns in the Room with the Razour ſo. This I ſaw, the Door being open, as I ſtood in the Paſſage. My Lord, by and by Mr. <hi>Bomeney</hi> goes down, and my Lord ſhut the Door to him, and Mr. <hi>Bomeney</hi> ſtaid below a little while, and afterwards comes up again. And my Lord was gone to the Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet to Stool as he ſuppoſed. So away he comes down again, and ſtaid about a quarter of an hour or there abouts. And this I ſee all my ſelf, my Lord.</p>

               <speaker>Capt. Hawley.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord; All the account I can give, is, That about 4 or 5 a Clock in the Morning, I went to open the Gates, that being the uſual hour to open the Gates. And I was at the Gate then when a Warder came, and told me, my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> had killed himſelf, and that was between 9 and 10 of the Clock. When I came into the Houſe, I went up Stairs, and ſaw no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in the Room, nor no Blood; ſaid I, to the Warder, What do you make a Fool of me? here is nothing: Says one of the Warders, look into the Cloſet, I went to the Cloſet, and could not open the Door above this wideneſs, and I looked in, and ſaw the Razour all in Blood, and my Lord lay on his Arm in this faſhion. I could not tell, Whether he was dead or no, but I thought it was not my buſineſs to ſtir him. Then my Lord Conſtable was Ordered to come and Scoure and Examine all the Servants.</p>

               <p>The Houſe, ever ſince I came to it, is juſt as it was; and the Houſe having ſetled, the Caſement won't open above thus far; and 'tis ſo low, and the Pales are 9 or 10 Foot high, that 'tis impſſible for any one to throw any thing out of the Window 3 Foot hardly. It is one of the horrideſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports that ever was heard of, and the unlikelyeſt thing, they cannot throw any thing out of the Window to be ſeen.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I have proved it here, That I had no hand in what I am Accuſed of. It is put down in the Information, that I Conſpired, with Mr. <hi>Bradden,</hi> to endeavour to procure falſe Witneſſes. I have proved, I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had any hand at all in any thing of it. It was an Accidental thing, his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to me; and it was a great Surprize to me, when he came; and I never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned my ſelf in it more, than the Writing of that Letter: And I had no ill intent in it; I did it not deſignedly; for I knew nothing of his coming; and I had not writ the Letter, if he had not come to me. And 'tis plain, it was a Surprize, for I always give my Man notice, when I go out of Town, before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand to prepare himſelf. I thought nothing at all of ill in the Letter: I writ it late at night, when I had been with ſome Company at the Tavern. And if he made me believe that to be True, which was not, I hope the Gentlemen of the Jury will conſider that. I have nothing to ſay of the thing, I did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern my ſelf in it any further at all, than Writing the Letter, which I did not well know, what I Writ.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I have only this to ſay for my ſelf. It has not been proved directly, or indirectly, That I uſed any evil Arguments, to perſwade theſe Witneſſes to teſtify what was falſe; but I dealt with them with all the Candour, that any Perſon in the World could uſe; and uſed all the Caution that I could, to hinder them from ſpeaking any thing that is falſe. There has been nothing proved of evil Practice uſed by me; and I deſire the Gentlemen of the Jury to take no other notice of any thing that has been, or ſhall be ſpoken, but what has been Proved.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen of the Jury. The Evidence has been very long, that has been given, both for and againſt the Perſons, againſt whom this Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is exhibited. 'Tis an Information exhibited by the Kings Attorney Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, in His Majeſties Name, againſt <hi>Lawrence Bradden,</hi> and <hi>Hugh Speke.</hi> And the Information does ſet forth, That the late <hi>Earl of Eſſex</hi> Murdered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the Tower, and that thereupon there was an Inquiſition taken before the Coroner, that did find that he had ſo Murdered himſelf, he being before that time Committed for High Treaſon, in Conſpiring the death of the King, and levying War to diſturb the Government. And theſe Perſons did render that Inquiſition, as tho' it had been Fraudulently and Irregularly obtained; and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:41249:32"/>
alſo to breed ill Blood, and ſpread falſe Rumours among the Kings Subjects, by endeavouring to perſwade them to believe, That the <hi>Earl of Eſſex</hi> was Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by ſome other hand, and had not Murdered himſelf, and had procured falſe Witneſſes to teſtify ſome ſuch matter, in order to the ſpreading about that falſe Rumour. This is the Subſtance of the Information. To this Information they have both pleaded, Not Guilty; and the Evidence, as I was telling you, has been ſomewhat long; but according to the beſt of my Memory, and for the aſſiſtance of yours, I will mind you of as many things, as occur to me, that have been ſaid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, and what has been ſaid on their behalf, I mean ſo much of it, as is Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. For I muſt tell you, all Hear-ſays, and common Diſcourſes of other Perſons is not Evidence, and I will give you that Reaſon, that is ſufficient to ſatisfie any man, that is Unbiaſſed, That if in caſe the Perſon, that ſo told the Story had been here, if he had not told it upon Oath, you could not have believed that Perſon: Therefore, ſurely there is leſs credit to be given to him, that tells a Tale out of another bodies mouth. And I tell you this, becauſe there has been great Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances given and ought to be, when people are accuſed of ſuch great and weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Crimes; for theſe are monſtrous Crimes, that theſe Gentlemen are accuſed of; but 'tis you, that are to try, whether they are Guilty or not: Certainly there is ſcarce in Nature a greater Crime that can be committed, than This, that is now before you; for I think Robbery, or any other ſuch Felonies, are not ſuch monſtrous Crimes in their true real Weight, tho', in conſideration of Law, in reſpect of Puniſhment they are greater; yet in point of Crime, they are ſurely leſs, for to ſpread falſe Reports, in order to raiſe Sedition, Ill-will, Heart-burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and Jealouſies in the Kings Subjects againſt the Government, and to ſuborn Witneſſes to that evil purpoſe, is ſurely a much greater Crime, than robbing on the High-way. Now, Gentlemen, 'tis not unknown to moſt of you, what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours have been of late made, to poſſeſs the minds of the King's Subjects, of great Injuries deſigned to be done them by the King, or His Authority: And in order to foment Differences and Miſapprehenſions between the King, and his People, and among the People between one and another, all Arts have been uſed, to Proſcribe People that they are minded to Expoſe. Thoſe, they bare ill will to, muſt be called Papiſts, or Papiſts in Maſquerade; but They and their Confederates are the Sober Party, the true Proteſtants, as if there were none Sober or True Proteſtants, but ſuch, as are Factious and Troubleſom in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. But by theſe things they bring an Odium upon the Name of a Proteſtant, their aim is by diſtinguiſhing to divide us; whereas if they were Proteſtants in truth, the true Church of <hi>England</hi> Proteſtants, they would have another behaviour, they would learn to obey, and ſubmit to Authority, and not go buzzing from Houſe to Houſe, and ſpreading falſe Reports, <hi>but ſtudy to be quiet, and do their own buſineſs.</hi> And tho' Mr. <hi>Bradden</hi> made uſe of the 5<hi>th Chap.</hi> of the <hi>Acts,</hi> to the Child, he would have done well to have taken notice of ſome other parts of Scripture, that are as much Scripture, as That, that enjoyn Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and Submiſſion to the Magiſtrate; and, being quiet and minding his own buſineſs, it's odds, he had never come to that trouble, he is now likely to meet with. But the Crime he is accuſed of, carries all the Venom and Baſeneſs, the greateſt inveteracy againſt the Government, that ever any Caſe did, that I have met with. For its inſinuated, That becauſe the King and the Duke were walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the <hi>Tower,</hi> that day, and near that time, when this unfortunate thing happened, now it muſt be whiſpered, as though the King and the Duke had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned this Murder. How Baſe? How Deviliſh, and Helliſh a Deſign is this? But yet, this muſt be ſpread about and endeavoured to be diſtilled into the minds of the Kings Subjects. But beſides, Gentlemen, you are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, as was opened by the King's Counſel, to what this thing tended;
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:41249:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for in as much as there was an horrid bloody Conſpiracy to take away the life of the King, and of his Dear Brother, his Royal Highneſs the Duke of <hi>York.</hi> And foraſmuch as ſeveral perſons have been duely executed for that Conſpiracy, who were concerned along with this unfortunate Lord; (I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not help the naming of it, though I am ſorry for his misfortune, for the ſake of that Honourable Family) but rather than he would abide his Tryal, God knows what other reaſon he had, but the probability of the thing ſpeaks it, he being conſcious, the great Guilt he had contracted in being concerned in ſuch a Conſpiracy made him deſtroy himſelf. And 'tis eaſie to imagin how far that might prevail upon him, it being done immediately after my Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> who was one of the Conſpirators with him, was carried to his Tryal. It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be thought, but it was to prevent the methods of Juſtice in his own parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Caſe. And, Gentlemen, there was <hi>Digitus Dei</hi> in it, and it is enough to ſatisfie all the World of the Conſpiracy; though we live in an Age wherein men are apt to believe only of one ſide, they can believe the greateſt Lye, if it makes for the advantage of their party, but not the greateſt Truth, if it thwarts their Intereſt.</p>
               <p>But becauſe Mr. Attorney has produced his proofs to manifeſt that this Lord murdered himſelf, I will take notice a little of it, becauſe it may have ſome good effect to undeceive ſome that have been impoſed upon. Not for my own ſatisfaction, I thank God I am ſatisfied, and ſo I believe are moſt honeſt men: but that ſilly people may not be impoſed upon by every buſie fellow for the future, that takes the liberty to run about and ſpread falſe News, and that men may be aware of ſuch fellows, and may not be decoyed any more by ſuch falſe pretences; it was therefore fit that Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſhould be given of the truth of the Fact, that that Gentleman did murder himſelf. And the Evidence is this.</p>
               <p>Beſides the Inquiſition, which was taken upon the Oaths of ſeveral perſons of Quality (as you hear upon the reading their Names, ſeveral of them were Eſquires, and men of Note) 'tis here alſo proved by the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of his Servant that attended him, how he came to his untimely end. And, Gentlemen, I would obſerve, 'tis Sworn by his Servant, one that had lived ſix years with him, not an upſtart, or a wandring fellow, but one whoſe integrity and fidelity to my Lord was confirmed by ſix years experience of his ſervice. Then here is the Wardour that was at the Door, here's the Souldier, here's the Maſter of the Houſe, who are all the perſons that probably can give any account of the matter, and they tell you poſitively that no one did go up and down, but this Frenchman, who was his <hi>Valet de Chambre.</hi> And the Wardour tells you, that he coming to the Door, and knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the Door, and hearing no one Anſwer, did endeavour to open the Door, but it was ſo faſt by my Lords feet, that he could open it but a little, and looking in, diſcerned blood, and that made him make Acclamations, as the Wardour calls it, Orations, which brought all the people in the houſe thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and they gave the ſame account that he does.</p>
               <p>And 'tis likewiſe fit to be taken notice of, that the window of this Cloſet looks into a private Yard, where no ſtrangers uſually come, and where no Coach could come; and that the Pales were ſo high, that in caſe a Man were deſirous to throw any thing out, it were impoſſible to caſt it above three Foot. And if there could no Coach at all come into the Yard, as it is plain there could not (for there is no door ſave only a back houſe door)
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:41249:33"/>
then this muſt needs be a lie, that was ſpread abroad. And 'tis beyond all peradventure true that my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> did murder himſelf.</p>
               <p>Now to have ſo great a truth as this to be perverted, and to reproach the Government with falſities, is the moſt malicious thing in the World. If in caſe the Law has made it penal for any man to ſcandalize any one pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate perſon as it has; and if it be by Law, much more penal to ſcandalize a Noble Man: how much more ought it to be, when the King and the whole Government is thus ſcandalized.</p>
               <p>Now to come to the Fact, as near as I can recollect, I will give you an account of what Evidence has been given of the one ſide and of the other. But this I thought fit to premiſe, becauſe there will ſome Circumſtances fall out fit to be taken notice of in the Evidence, eſpecially about the Window in Captain <hi>Hawleys</hi> Yard and Houſe, which may be cleared this way.</p>
               <p>In the firſt part of the Evidence for the King, they call a Witneſs to prove the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s Commitment, which is part of the Inducement in the Information.</p>
               <p>But for the Information it ſelf, there is this Evidence. Firſt, <hi>Evans</hi> he comes and tells you, how that he had heard at the <hi>Cuſtom-houſe</hi> from <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> the Father of this Boy, as though there had been a report came to him from home, at ten a Clock that morning my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> cut his Throat, of a Razour thrown out of my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s Window; That he came to him in the afternoon again, and in the afternoon told him, He had exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the matter further, and his Boy confirmed the truth of it. He ſays that after this, Mr. <hi>Bradden</hi> and another man, one Mr. <hi>Hatſell,</hi> if I am not miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in his name, came to the place where he was in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and there they had ſome diſcourſe about my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s death, and there <hi>Hatſell</hi> took out of his Pocket a printed Copy of the Inquiſition; and Mr. <hi>Bradden</hi> was then in the Room, but he ſays he thinks Mr. <hi>Bradden</hi> at that time took no manner of notice of it, but walked about the Room. But he ſaies the Inquiſition was read while he was in the Room, and <hi>Evans</hi> ſaid ſomething about the report he had heard, which did ſeem to contradict that Inquiſition. But ſome time after, he ſaies that he being at the Coffee houſe, <hi>Bradden</hi> and <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> came to him into the Coffee-houſe, and there they began to talk: <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> ſaid, that <hi>Bradden</hi> had been with his Child to examine him, to bear Teſtimony about flinging the Razour out at Window. He was very full of the word [Matter], and toſſed that to and fro, but at length the Subſtance of his Matter was, that Report of the Boys, and he adviſed them to forbear talking any farther to him about the Matter, for it might do <hi>Edwards</hi> and <hi>Bradden</hi> both an injury; and he had read the Inquiſition which was quite contrary. That was all he could ſay.</p>
               <p>Then comes <hi>Edwards,</hi> and the Subſtance of what he ſays is this, That he firſt heard it from his Family, and afterwards the Boy confirmed the truth of it; but then afterwards he heard he had denyed it, which was after <hi>Bradden</hi> had been there to inquire about it. And then he ſays <hi>Bradden</hi> came to him again, and then he had got a Note dictated by himſelf and not by the Boy, but at firſt he tendred it to the Boy, and the Boy refuſed to put his hand to it, and Mr. <hi>Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> came again another time (though he was told the Boy had denyed it as he heard) and then the Boy did ſet his Hand. This is the Subſtance of what <hi>Edwards</hi> ſays. He does ſay indeed, the Boy uſed to tell lies very often, to make excuſes when he played Truant, and that his Family told him, the Boy was often guilty of telling of lies.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:41249:33"/>Then the next Evidence is the Evidence of the Boy himſelf. He it ſeems is thirteen years of Age: certainly any man that had been of an upright mind and Conſcience, as Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> pretends to be, and would have you Gentlemen think him ſo; would have it thought that he was full of honeſty and integrity to the Boy, when he baited his Hook with a Text of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, about the danger of telling a Lye, and, <hi>Have a care, Child, of telling a Lye</hi>; if he had done no more, but given him this advice, it had been wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of commendation: but when the Boy had refuſed to ſign it, for him to go and make ſuch a ſtir without examining further into the particulars, but only taking a ſlight report from ſuch a Child, and to make ſuch a diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance in the Nation, and ſuch a Noiſe not only here but abroad, as this has done, ſure argues neither uprightneſs nor Conſcience. Had the Boy ſtood in it and perſevered in it, it had become him, in regad of the tenderneſs of the boys age, to have been more inquiſitive into Circumſtances, before he gave ſuch credit to what he ſaid, as to make all this adoe.</p>
               <p>But what ſays the Boy, when he comes here, he is now upon his Oath, and he tells you, He did tell his Mother ſo at firſt, and he did tell Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> ſo at firſt; but afterwards when his Siſter ſpake to him, and bid him be ſure to tell nothing, but what was truth, then he ſaid truly, it was not truth. He tells you Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> offered him the Paper to ſign, but he would not ſign it; and being asked the Queſtion, Why he would not ſign it: He ſays, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was not true; and being asked, Whether <hi>Braddon</hi> had notice of this, the Mother and Siſters all tell you, He had notice the Boy had deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it.</p>
               <p>How came Mr. <hi>Braddon,</hi> what Authority had he to take this Examination? He is no Juſtice of Peace, no Magiſtrate, that had any authority to take Examinations. What concern had he in it more than other people? The Boy could tell him there were abundance of people there beſides himſelf, though it was a Lye he told then, and that the Girl told now. Why did not he ſtay to have it confirmed by ſome of thoſe people? Why did not he carry theſe Children before ſome Magiſtrate, or Juſtice of Peace, ſome body that had authority to take Examinations? There was a Spirit that prevailed with Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> to engage and make a ſtir in this buſineſs; and you may eaſily gueſs what a kind of Spirit it was which gave him this authority that he had not before.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, Another thing is this, 'Tis plain, and the Boy now ſwears it directly, That whereas he put it into his Information, How that he told him he was going to ſee my Lord <hi>Brandon Gerrard</hi>'s Lodgings, but now he is upon his Oath, he ſwears directly, he never told him any ſuch thing, and yet he hath put it into the Paper he made him ſign.</p>
               <p>He tells you a ſecond time, Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> came to him, which was after the Boy had refuſed and declared himſelf unwilling, and that then he was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded by Mr. <hi>Braddon,</hi> who told him there was no harm in it; if there be any harm, it would be to him, and not to the Boy, and ſo by vertue of that, he inſinuated himſelf, and got the Child to ſign that Paper, which is every Tittle of it falſe, as the Boy now ſwears directly. And he tells you, How he was impoſed upon by Mr. <hi>Braddon,</hi> pretending there was no harm to him, all the harm would come to himſelf, and by reaſon of theſe Inſinuations he was prevailed upon, to put his Name to that which was notoriouſly falſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:41249:34"/>The next Witneſs (to make it appear that it was notoriouſly falſe, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the Boy himſelf, but by other Circumſtances) is <hi>Hawkins</hi> the Miniſters Son, Dr. <hi>Hawkin</hi>'s Son of the Tower. And he tells you, I play'd Truant as well as he that day, and I ſaw the King and the Duke at the Tower, and when I had ſeen them I went about as they did, and afterwards I went home, and there came a Report, that my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> had cut his Throat, which made me go back again to the Tower, and there was I a conſiderable time gaping among other people, and there did I ſee this Boy <hi>Edwards</hi>; when he came there, I was there; I was there all the time that he was there, and we went out of the Tower together, and there was no ſuch thing, nor any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence or ground for ſuch a ſtory. And <hi>Edwards</hi> himſelf being asked the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, upon his Oath, doth likewiſe ſay, <hi>Hawkins</hi> was with him all the time there. So that that ſhews not only by what the Boy ſays, that it was falſe, but it is alſo proved falſe by the Teſtimony of this other Witneſs <hi>Hawkins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then next comes Mr. <hi>Blathwait</hi> who was preſent when Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> was before the King, and what does he ſay? He ſays there was the Boy fetched, and the Girl fetched, and all perſons examined there, and then 'tis told him, all the Boy had ſaid to him was falſe, and it was told him with all its Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. So that notice ſufficient, if you will believe Mr. <hi>Blathwait,</hi> was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to this Mr. <hi>Braddon,</hi> That the Boy had denyed it then, as he had before to his Siſter: So he knew it was falſe.</p>
               <p>But what does Mr. <hi>Bradden</hi> do now? He is ſo far from being ſatisfied in the Matter, that inſtead of ſtopping there, his Zeal tranſported him to purſue it further: And ſo he tells you, that Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> confeſſed he would have got ſome Juſtice of Peace to have the Boy examined; and he applyed himſelf to Sir <hi>Robert Clayton,</hi> and Sir <hi>John Lawrence.</hi> There were many Juſtices of the Peace beſides them, in <hi>London,</hi> to whom he might have applyed himſelf. But when he comes to Sir <hi>Robert Clayton,</hi> and acquaints him with the matter, he would not do it alone; it was thought a Matter of that Importance. Then ſays Mr. <hi>Bradden,</hi> you ſhan't do it at all. He muſt have the kindneſs of having it done in private; to have it examined when any body was by, was not ſo well for his purpoſe; which ſhews you ſtill, Gentlemen, his deſign was to contrive privately, to effect that which the light ſhould not eaſily diſcover.</p>
               <p>Then the next thing is the Evidence of Mr. <hi>Monſtevens,</hi> And he gives you an account, That he came to him, and he read the Information, and gave him a Caution, that he wondered at him: ſays he, Why do you concern your ſelf about this buſineſs, there is Sir <hi>Henry Capell,</hi> he does not concern himſelf: Then he pretended to come in his Name, but at length, when Mr. <hi>Monſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens</hi> began to diſpute it with him, why Sir <hi>Henry</hi> did not appear himſelf in it; Then truly Sir <hi>Henry Capell</hi> was very ill, and could not poſſibly come him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but I am to go to him, and give him ſatisfaction about what I do, and ſo alſo to the Counteſs of <hi>Eſſex.</hi> No, ſays Mr. <hi>Monſtevens,</hi> that cannot be, for Sir <hi>Henry Capell</hi> is not ſo ill, but that he has been with my Lord <hi>Sunderland,</hi> and with the King too, ſince the death of my Lord of <hi>Eſſex.</hi> To which he made him no Anſwer. So that that was but an excuſe and a Subterfuge; but yet notwithſtanding all this Caution, he continues on his Zeal in the thing: whereupon Mr. <hi>Monſtevens</hi> brought him to my Lord <hi>Sunderland,</hi> and what diſcourſe has paſt between them, he has given you an account of. The next
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:41249:34"/>
Evidence is Sir <hi>Henry Capel,</hi> who tells you, That <hi>Braddon</hi> comes officiouſly and tells him, He had ſome diſcovery to make about the death of the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and you hear that poor Gentleman being related to this unfortunate Noble Lord, was at the firſt time very much under ſurprize (being in ſuch great affliction as one Brother muſt needs be for another, Nature obliges Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to a great concern for ſuch Accidents) and he ſays, he is not able to give an account what he ſaid, or did, at that time, or what <hi>Braddon</hi> did particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly ſay to him. But when he came the ſecond time to him, he was a little more ſedate and calm, and then (he does remember) he told him, If you have any thing of this nature to ſay, Go to a <hi>Secretary of State,</hi> it is his buſineſs to inquire into this Affair, and 'tis not the buſineſs of every particular private man, becauſe theſe are Matters that concern the Government. But <hi>Braddon</hi> pretended (forſooth) it was his Zeal and his great Conſcience that made him to be thus tranſported, and to be ſo eager for carrying on this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution.</p>
               <p>The next Witneſs, Gentlemen, that you hear of, is the Gentleman that ſeized upon Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> in the Country; and that is Mr. <hi>Beech,</hi> who brought him before a Juſtice of Peace (one <hi>Ayres</hi> that it ſeems is ſince dead) and in his Pocket he found a Letter from the other Defendant <hi>Speke,</hi> which is the only thing indeed in the Evidence that does affect that Gentleman; and what that Letter is, you have heard it read, and for your better ſatisfaction, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Language of the Letter is pretty extraordinary, if you have a mind to have it to peruſe while you are here in Court, you may have it with you. I ſuppoſe you remember the ſubſtance of it, commending the great Integrity, Courage, and Magnanimity of this Gentleman Mr. <hi>Braddon,</hi> thanking the Perſon to whom it was writ, for his great kindneſs to him and his Friends, how they did hope to be able to get the Murder of my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> tryed before any in the Tower could come to their Tryal; That the Tide ran ſtrong againſt them: And, pray, you muſt take notice, I have given him a hint he muſt go by another Name, by the Name of <hi>Johnſon,</hi> and not by the Name of <hi>Braddon</hi>; for a lack-a-day he would be ſtabbed, in theſe dangerous times, or knocked on the head, if he be known by his own Name. Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> would be thought a man ſo conſiderable in the World for his Zeal for truth, and the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion, that there was very great hazard of his being murdered, we live in ſuch perillous times.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, This is to amuſe and affright people, and to put odd thoughts and jealouſies and fears into the minds of the Kings Subjects, which was the beginning and riſe of the late Rebellion, which we have all reaſon to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member with horrour; that Rebellion that in the Iſſue of it brought the late King of bleſſed memory to the Scaffold: And therefore we muſt have a great care of ſuch things growing upon us now.</p>
               <p>And pray, Gentlemen, mind the Stile of the Letter: <hi>We</hi> have many thanks to give you, for your care of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s,</hi> and countenance you have given to <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s,</hi> and <hi>We</hi> don't doubt <hi>We</hi> ſhall be able to carry on the buſineſs of the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> notwithſtanding that the Tide runs ſtrong againſt <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s; We</hi> hope this, and <hi>We</hi> hope that, and t'other, and ſo makes himſelf a Party. And he recommends him in particular, to Sir <hi>Robert Atkins,</hi> to whom the Letter was written, to adviſe him in the matter he went about (which by the way, you ſee, was to pick up falſe Evidence) to carry on this wicked
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:41249:35"/>
deſign. And I muſt tell you, Gentlemen, If Mr. <hi>Speke</hi> was given to believe a Lye, and did write that Letter, with a deſign to have that Lye ſpread abroad, he makes himſelf a party, and he is as guilty in every Circumſtance as the other, as to the deſign in general laid in the Information, though not equally guilty about the management of the Witneſſes: And it is the Letter only that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly affects him. But I tell you, If in caſe you think he was ſurprized in the thing, or did it ignorantly or innocently, without any Concern (though he ſeems to have a wonderful concern in his Letter, and very zealous he ſeems to be in the proſecution of this buſineſs) you are to acquit him. But, if he did contribute to the deſign of ſpreading this falſe report, he is as guilty of that part as Mr. <hi>Braddon,</hi> though he be not guilty of Suborning the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes. But the Evidence againſt <hi>Braddon</hi> goes farther; There is not only the Evidence of this Letter, which ſpeaks plain enough, as to this deſign, but you find alſo about him all the Informations that have been read. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of this Boy of thirteen years of Age; the Information of the Girle of thirteen years of Age: There was alſo taken in his Pocket a Letter from one <hi>Burgis</hi> a famous Pin-maker of <hi>Marleborough,</hi> written to one <hi>Cumpen</hi> a Poſt-Maſter at <hi>Froom,</hi> in this manner: <q>Pray call to mind ſuch a buſineſs of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a report, of my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s cutting his throat, upon <hi>Friday</hi> the thirteenth of <hi>July</hi> laſt. Pray recollect ſuch a thing, and impart it to this Gentleman the Bearer.</q> This likewiſe was intruſted with Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi>: But it ſeems the man had gone and writ his Letter, and had put in the ſixth day, which happened to be a week too ſoon, and this muſt be rectified by Mr. <hi>Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> himſelf, he being a great Companion of Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi>'s; for it ſeems he had ſuch a confidence in him, that upon his Report, he came down from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Marleborough,</hi> though now indeed, they pretend they never knew one another before: But it is proved he confeſſed he had ſuch a regard to his report, that that brought him down from <hi>London.</hi> He had (as I was ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) put it down the ſixth at his firſt writing; and I believe as to the thing it ſelf, it was as true the ſixth as any other time, and the ſixteenth and the twenty ſixth is all one to ſuch people. And this Letter he tells you himſelf was writen ſix weeks after, but Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> muſt correct it: No, ſays he, you miſtake, it muſt be the thirteenth, it muſt not be the ſixth; the ſixth would not do the buſineſs, for the thirteenth was the day that he was murdred, and ſo he was forced to interline it, the thirteenth, to make it to humour the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; for the Lye would not paſs ſo well if it had been put upon a day ſo long before: but to make the Lye a correct Lye, and to humour the reſt of the Evidence, Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> comes and informs him, it muſt be the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth.</p>
               <p>That was the next piece of Evidence that was given, and I think the ſubſtance of the Evidence of the whole matter given againſt the Defendants for the King, except it be ſome remarks out of the Evidence that has been given on the other ſide, which it will be material for you to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of.</p>
               <p>Now, Gentlemen, For the Defendants they bring this Evidence: Firſt, they bring a man, I think his name was <hi>Lewes,</hi> to whom they gave the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney before he would give his Evidence. And he ſays one day he was going up a Hill near <hi>Andover,</hi> and going up the Hill, he heard the News of my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s cutting his throat; but what Day, Week or Month it was, he cannot
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:41249:35"/>
tell that he heard this. And, Gentlemen, Let me tell you, 'tis as bad as the caſe it ſelf, and worſe if poſſible, the endeavouring to pick up Witneſſes to put a Colour and Countenance upon ſo black a Villany as this is. Then the next Evidence is <hi>Fielder,</hi> and he tells you, that at their Town of <hi>Andover</hi> the <hi>Wedneſday</hi> before my Lord murdred him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, it was all the talk about the Town, that he had cut his throat; it was in every bodies mouth, the Market people, Men, Women and Children, all over the Town had it, when the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> did it not till the <hi>Friday</hi> following. We asked him to name any one, no tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he could not, the Town was ſo full of people, and yet, he cannot remember one, whence he had it: but Gentlemen here is the malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous deſign of the matter: 'Tis to make it believed it was a deſigned buſineſs to murder my Lord, and caſt it upon himſelf, and they knew of the deſign at <hi>Andover,</hi> two days before the fact was done: As though the perſons that deſigned to murder him, would go to make it publick, as ſuch a Report was likely to do. But the deſign of this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the falſhood and baſeneſs of the thing it ſelf, does ſpeak malice and ſedition, and all the diſtempers of a diſloyal mans Heart; and to go about to get Witneſſes to ſupport the credibility of a thing that is notoriouſly falſe, is ten times worſe than the ſpreading of ſuch a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Then comes Mrs. <hi>Edwards</hi> the Mother, ſhe is the next Witneſs, and ſhe tells you at firſt, the Boy did tell this ſtrange Story, but afterwards denyed it, but ſhe likewiſe tells you, how Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> came, and how he dealt with the Boy. He is a buſie man, you ſee, a great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former that does mightily concern himſelf in the Reformation of the Government. I never knew that Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> had any great ſhare in it: He has not ſuch a prodigious Eſtate I ſuppoſe, that for fear of loſing his great Eſtate he ſhould be ſo wondrous buſie and active in reforming the Government; but I have always obſerved it for a Rule, that your beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly inconſiderable fellows are the warmeſt people in the buſineſs of Reformation, and for defending Liberty and Property as they call it; and then they put it under the diſguiſe of Religion, when alas thoſe that have no Religion are generally the greateſt pretenders of taking care of it; and thoſe that have no Eſtates nor Properties, are uſually the fulleſt of noiſe about Liberty and Property. But the meaning of it is plain, if they can but exaſperate the people into a Rebellion, that is the way to get a property: And if they can but have Liberty to do what they pleaſe, that is all the Liberty they contend for. They are ſuch mean inconſiderable fellows only that make all this ado among us: For no perſons of any intereſt or quality will offer to engage in any ſuch thing. But I hope the Snare is ſeen, and we ſhall avoid it; for God be thanked we live under a regular Government, where the Laws are duly exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted; we need not be afraid of wrong from the Government. The Courts of Juſtice are open where they may have ſecurity; and the beſt ſecurity to good Subjects, is that which the Law gives them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:41249:36"/>Mrs. <hi>Edwards,</hi> ſhe tells you, When <hi>Braddon</hi> came to inquire about it, it made them all a little concerned; and the Daughter was affrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and ſhe comes to the Boy, and ſays, <hi>Billy, Billy,</hi> here has been a Man about ſuch a thing, pray ſpeak the truth: Why, ſays he, will any harm come of it? Says ſhe, I can't tell, but tell you the truth. And then when the Boy comes to tell truth, he then ſays, All the ſtory was falſe. Beſides this, ſays ſhe, we told Mr. <hi>Braddon,</hi> before the Boy ſigned it, That he had ſaid it was falſe; and he was told it again before the King and Council, that it was falſe. But nothing would ſerve him, but he muſt have a Horſe and a Man, and he muſt go his Circuit to pick up ridiculous ſtories. Letters muſt be contrived from one to another to give a colour to the matter, and all this to ſpread about his malicious Reports and falſe News.</p>
               <p>And by this means, Gentlemen, I muſt tell you, The matter is fixed as to the ſecond part of the Information, which is the corrupting of Witneſſes; for though he did not get any Witneſſes ſworn, and ſo 'tis no Subornation of Perjury, ſtrictly, yet however 'tis a Miſdemeanor to labour any one, much more ſuch a Child, into a falſity, as apparently he did; for as the Boy ſwears now, He never did make mention of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to my Lord <hi>Gerrards</hi> Lodgings.</p>
               <p>The next Evidence is young Mrs. <hi>Edwards, Sarah</hi> the Daughter, and ſhe comes and gives an account of the ſame. That the Boy did tell ſuch a ſtory at firſt, but ſays ſhe, I knew him to be ſuch a lying Boy, and I had ſo often found him in Lies, that I did not mind what he ſaid. And he uſed to tell Lies when he had been playing Truant. Then comes Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> to inquire about the buſineſs, and when he began to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute it, the Girl began to be affrighted, and ſhe calls the Boy to her, and ingaged him to tell her the Truth, and then immediately upon that, he did ſay, it was all a ſtory, and invention of his own.</p>
               <p>And then 'tis very material to obſerve, That the Boy in that Paper of Information (which is all of Mr. <hi>Braddons</hi> hand-writing) makes the Circumſtance of the Razors falling down, to be caſt of the inſide of the Pales, and the Girl ſays, it was of the outſide, and there was a Coach, and abundance of People by, and a great many fine Circumſtances, and not one of them true.</p>
               <p>The next piece of Evidence is, ſhe does ſay, That after he told her it was falſe, ſhe gave notice to <hi>Braddon,</hi> and being asked, Whether ſhe did not frighten him by threatning his Father would be turned out of his place? ſhe ſwears, No. But all thoſe kind of Queſtions were by a ſide wind, to make Reflections upon the Government; as though the King would turn men out, becauſe they would not ſwear what was falſe. It carries, I tell you, a ſting towards the Government ſtill, and ſhews the malice of the deſign. But, Gentlemen, you hear what is ſaid about that, there was no ſuch thing ſaid; They did apprehend ſome fear, but from whom their fear came, that they can't tell. But ſhe poſitively ſwears, when the Boy had denyed it, he had notice of it; and when he refuſed to ſign it, yet he preſſed him, by telling him, there was no harm in it like to come, but only to Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> himſelf, and ſo he was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to ſign it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:41249:36"/>The next Witneſs is Mrs. <hi>Barton</hi>; She comes and tells you, that ſhe was at Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s houſe, and what ſhe tells you of her own know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, you are to take for Evidence, and nothing more. She ſays <hi>Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> did engage the Boy to tell truth, and put him in mind of that Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the <hi>Acts,</hi> of the great diſpleaſure of God againſt the two Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes that forſwore themſelves, and bid him ſpeak nothing but the truth. And after he had talked thus awhile, ſhe obſerved he was going to take Pen, Ink, and Paper, and ſhe was afraid ſhe might be drawn in for a Witneſs, and ſo ſhe went out of the Room. But before that time, Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> did go to ſee the Window, and the place where the Boy ſaid the Razor was thrown out.</p>
               <p>Then there is the Evidence of the little Girl, who is the next Witneſs, <hi>Jane Lodeman</hi> I think her name was, and that is likewiſe written by Mr. <hi>Braddon.</hi> Now you hear what that young Wench ſays. She comes and would give ſome ſort of Countenance to the thing, How ſhe was looking up at the Window of my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s Lodgings, and that there was a bloody Razor thrown by a hand out of the Window, but whether it was half bloody, or all over bloody, ſhe can't tell, but bloody it was; and it was, as ſhe ſays, thrown on the outſide, though the Boy ſaid, it was thrown of the inſide. But the Wench being asked, Whether ſhe knew that was my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s Lodgings? She an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, No, ſhe did not, when they come and make her ſwear in her Information, that ſhe ſaw the Razor thrown out of my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s Lodgings: And then ſhe ſays, ſhe heard no Souldier ſpeak a word at all: but in the Information, it is ſet down, that the Soldier cryed out to the people of the Houſe, Go and fetch up the Razor. And this was all done in open day, and there were abundance of people, but ſhe could not tell any particular body. So that of one hundred people, which, if ſhe ſay true, were there, Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> could not ſatisfie himſelf to inquire after ſome of them, but only he muſt pick up a Child of thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years of age, to practiſe upon, in this villanous manner. And it carries the greater venom, and malice, and virulency, and baſeneſs, to endeavour to corrupt young people, to that heighth, as to come and ſay, and ſwear thoſe things in the face of a Court, that are impoſſible to be true. It is impoſſible to be true, that ſhe ſaw a Coach in the yard; for you hear what account Captain <hi>Hawley</hi> gives of his houſe. It is impoſſible to be true, that there ſhould be a crowd of people, becauſe that there was a Sentinel at the door, who muſt ſee all that go out, and that come in; and there is no way to go into the Yard, but through the Back-door, and the Pales are ſo high, that nothing can be flung over, that could be eaſily diſcerned. So that the very thoughts of ſuch a thing as this are ridiculous in themſelves, and not only the falſity of the ſtory is apparent, but there is alſo apparent, a great villany, in endeavouring to get Witneſſes to prove that falſity. For you ſee who Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> employs; he gets a Barber to go along with him on purpoſe to teſtifie what idle Reports he could pick up. But this Barber, and the other Witneſſes, when they come here can't tell any thing. For the Barber, he ſays, ſhe ſaid, <hi>There lay a Razor</hi>;
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:41249:37"/>
but the Information ſays, (to which he is a Witneſs) that the Soldier cryed, <hi>Take up the Razor:</hi> and ſhe now upon her Oath denys any thing of that.</p>
               <p>The next Evidence is the Aunt, and ſhe tells you, ſhe does not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member ſuch and ſuch particulars, but ſomewhat to that purpoſe ſhe does; but whether ſhe named my Lord of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> or no, in particular, as to his Lodgings, ſhe cannot give an account.</p>
               <p>Then you have <hi>Glasbrooke,</hi> that comes to give an account concerning this Girls ſtory, and he plainly is quite different from what the others had teſtified before; for his Evidence is, That the Girl had ſaid my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> cut his own Throat, and afterwards flung the Razour out of a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow: After he had committed this horrid Murder upon himſelf, he got to life again, and threw away the Inſtrument he did it with, that is plainly his Teſtimony, that this Child ſhould ſay ſo. So that as in the Caſe of <hi>Suſanna,</hi> which I heard cited here upon another occaſion, the wicked Elders were diſcovered by the different Circumſtances of time and place; ſo here you have Circumſtances of time and place, and of all things in the World that can contribute to prove the falſity of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and to prove the malicious deſign of theſe people that were enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in this buſineſs.</p>
               <p>The next Witneſs is one <hi>Smith,</hi> and he ſpeaks much to the ſelf ſame purpoſe. He was the Barber that went with <hi>Braddon</hi> to examine this Girl.</p>
               <p>Now, Gentlemen, You are to conſider of theſe Contrivances of <hi>Braddon,</hi> in buſying himſelf to ſolicit theſe Children to teſtifie theſe ſtories, after a denial by the Boy to ſign the Paper, To tell him there was no harm could come to him, to dictate what he ſhould ſay, and put words into his mouth, about going to ſee my Lord <hi>Gerrard</hi>'s Lodgings, which he never ſpake of; for him to dictate to the other Witneſs the Pin-maker of <hi>Marleborough,</hi> what the right day ſhould be, to ſet up ſuch a ſenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſtory that he heard ſuch a thing at the <hi>Poſthouſe,</hi> but he cannot tell from whom, or name any one that heard it or ſpake it beſides himſelf: it is ſtrange how he ſhould meet with this man, for even the man himſelf tells you, he knows not who he had diſcourſed of it to; and never ſaw <hi>Braddon</hi> till that time he writ the Letter. But you may obſerve that to be ſure the report might be ſpread, it was ſo contrived that the ſcene ſhould be laid in the <hi>Poſthouſe,</hi> and then it was like to run abroad quickly; for alas it was not their buſineſs to make truth of it, but to make the diſcontented rabble believe it to be a truth. And ſo they began to conſult with themſelves where it was beſt to lodge it, and upon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation the place muſt humour the deſign as well as the time, and that muſt be at the Poſt-Maſters houſe, in order to diſperſe the noiſe of it, and then Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> takes his Circuit to <hi>Salisbury</hi> unto Sir <hi>Robert Atkins</hi> at <hi>Stow</hi> in the <hi>Hold,</hi> and to other people, filling the Country with his braded Ware; and 'tis time to look after ſuch Pedlars, for they vent the worſt of Ware.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:41249:37"/>Then, Gentlemen, you may obſerve this fellow is eaſily perſwaded to ſwear any thing, for he gives no manner of account how he came to hear what he ſpeaks of, or from whom, or how Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> came to him: He had never ſeen him before that time, he ſays; (though Mr. <hi>Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> had ſuch a value for this worſhipful Pin-maker, whom he never ſaw, that he came from <hi>London</hi> upon the leaſt intimation of this man, ſo zealous he was for the carrying on this weighty affair, which I may call this impudent and intolerable Lye).</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I muſt tell you, if any proof in the world be ſufficient to prove malice, you have ſufficiet proof of it before you now. If it had been a thing of indiſcretion only without malice, if there had been nothing of Caution given to him about it as a thing that concerned not him, there might have been ſomething ſaid to alleviate it; but for him to come as if he had Authority from the Counteſs of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and Sir <hi>Henry Capel</hi> who denies it, ſhews the malice of his deſign.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, 'tis a concern of an High nature, and if you do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live theſe perſons that are Defendants, or either of them to be guilty; ſuch as you believe to be guilty, you muſt find Guilty, and of ſo much as you believe them Guilty. And if in caſe they ſhall by you be found guilty, the Court is to take care to inflict a puniſhment, if it be poſſible, ſuitable to their Offence.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>
               <hi>Then the Court aroſe, and the Jury afterwards gave in a private Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, which the next morning was repeated in Court and recorded. And by that Verdict they found the Defendant</hi> Laurence Braddon <hi>guilty of the whole matter charged upon him in the Information, and the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant</hi> Hugh Speke <hi>guilty of all but the conſpiring to procure falſe Witneſſes, and of that they found him Not Guilty.</hi>

               <p>MY Lord, Here are two Perſons to receive your Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>Who are they?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Att. Gen.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Bradden</hi> and <hi>Speke.</hi> But it being late, I know not whether you will give it now, or appoint ſome other time.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>No, no, let them come in, They will ſay we are afraid of giving Judgment elſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>Then Mr. <hi>Bradden</hi> and Mr. <hi>Speke</hi> came into Court.</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Att. Gen.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>My Lord, We pray your Judgment for the King, that you will ſet a good Fine.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Williams.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>We are retained to move in Arreſt of Judgment.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Att. Gen.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Judgment is entered already, and there is nothing but a Fine in the Caſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Williams.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>My Lord, If it be entered, it is entered but this Term, and 'tis in the Breaſt of the Court, if they pleaſe to admit us to ſpeak in Arreſt of Judgment.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>When were the Rules out?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Williams.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>My Lord, it was put off by conſent to this day.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>But when were the Rules out, I ask?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cl. of Crown.</speaker>
               <p>The Rules were out the laſt day of the laſt Term, and then Judgment was entered.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>Well then Judgment is entered, what ſay you againſt a Fine?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M. <hi>Williams.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>We were retained to move in Arreſt of Judgment, I am ſure I was, and inſtructed to that purpoſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>I cannot tell what you were retained to do, but now Judgment is entered, what ſay you as to the Fine?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Williams.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>We cannot ſay any thing as to that, we are not inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; I am ſure, I am not.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Wallop.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>My Lord, we took it, and I was told ſo, That it was put off by conſent to this day.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>I know nothing of your Conſent, nor what you conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to. If you conſent among your ſelves at the Bar, that is nothing to the Court. Here we find Judgment entered, and we muſt proceed upon what is before us.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Wallop.</hi>

               <p>Your Lordſhip will pleaſe to remember, what the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence was.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>I do remember it very particularly.</p>

               <speaker>Counſel.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, Mr. <hi>Speke</hi> is found Guilty of nothing but Writing that Letter.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Att. Gen.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>He is found Guilty of all but the Suborning.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>We do very well know there is a difference between them.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:41249:39"/>Then the laſt Rule was read.</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>Well, Judgment is regularly entered, what ſay you to it for the Defendants?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Wallop.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>My Lord, we conceive we have very good matter upon the Verdict, to move in Arreſt of Judgment.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, no doubt what you have to ſay is extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary material, but you come too late, we cannot hear you. Sir <hi>Samu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el Aſtrey,</hi> is Judgment entered according to the courſe of the Court?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cl. of Cr.</speaker>
               <p>Yes.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>Then we muſt proceed to fine them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Bradden.</speaker>
               <p>Pray, my Lord, Let Mr. <hi>Ward</hi> be asked, whether they did not agree we ſhould move to day?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Ward.</speaker>
               <p>That was only an agreement on <hi>Saturday</hi> that they might appear to day, and I would not take them in Execution.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Bradden</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>This was the day, I was to move in, my Lord; Mr. <hi>Burton</hi> knows very well, he agreed to it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Burton.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>I know nothing more of it, my Lord, but that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I did conſent on <hi>Saturday,</hi> that whatſoever they could move then, they ſhould move on <hi>Munday.</hi>
               </p>

            <sp>

               </speaker>
               <p>That was only that they ſhould appear to day, inſtead of <hi>Bradden</hi>'s being taken up by a <hi>Capias pro Fine.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>Well, well; I know nothing of your agreements, here is Judgment entered regularly as we find it, you had beſt bring your Action againſt Mr. <hi>Burton,</hi> if he have done you any wrong, but I did not know that Mr. <hi>Burton</hi> was the Kings Attorney. But I find here is Judgment againſt you, and 'tis for a very foul Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, as notorious an Offence as any Perſon, under that which is Capital, could be guilty of; baſe aſperſions of the Government, in order to promote Sedition, and Faction, and for that End made uſe of all Villanous means to corrupt Infants, and then juſtify that Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany with a brazen Face, to that degree of Impudence as I never before ſaw, That all the Juſtice of the Nation muſt be affronted by ſuch audacious Fellows, for it ſeems his Confidence has not left him, but here he ſmiles, and ſeems as if he had done no harm:</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Bradden.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I know my own Innocency, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have no reaſon to be troubled.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>Your Innocence! your Impudence you mean. I tell you, had you been in any other Country, but this, the Innocence you brag of, would have ſent you to the Gallies.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Juſt. Wythins.</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>Ay, I aſſure you does he. And the Zeal of his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty has gone ſo far, that at <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> when I was there in the Circuit, I was told that his Doctrine had obtained ſo much in that Country, eſpecially about that place whence ſome of his Witneſſes came, I mean, <hi>Andover,</hi> that there was a Woman that was here the other day, Mrs. <hi>Drake,</hi> being at Conventicle, held forth, that my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> was murdered, while the King was in the Tower, and that God was the Avenger of Murder, and had found out a proper Perſon for the Proſecution of it, that was Mr. <hi>Bradden</hi>; and this
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:41249:39"/>
ſnivelling Cant prevailed at the Conventicle. It is no ſuch ſmirking mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as you make it, Mr. <hi>Bradden,</hi> I aſſure you.</p>

               <p>We remember what Sir <hi>Samuel Bernardiſton,</hi> in his Letter, ſpeaks of this matter. Mr. <hi>Bradden,</hi> he was got off; why they dare not meddle with Mr. <hi>Bradden,</hi> he is ſuch a dreadful man, and his Party are ſo conſiderable that we dare not meddle with them; and the TORIES are all caſt down; alack a day! becauſe theſe Fellows can't caſt down the Government, therefore all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt men muſt be caſt down, and not dare to meddle with them; but they ſhall ſee we are not ſo much caſt down, but we are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to reach the higheſt of them.

               <p>I don't know truly, that may be as falſe as any thing elſe you went about to have theſe Children Swear, but I'le under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take it, if thou hadſt told the little Girl that he had 800 <hi>l.</hi> a year, ſhe would have been as ready to have Sworn it as the other.</p>

               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>Ay, but there is a difference between them. The Crime was very great in Mr. <hi>Speke,</hi> tho' not ſo great as in Mr. <hi>Bradden,</hi> and I am ſorry that Mr <hi>Speke</hi> ſhould be concerned in it, and ſhould take ſuch care about ſuch a buſineſs, with all that Piety and Zeal for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion he expreſſes in his Letter to Sir <hi>Robert Atkyns,</hi> (Mr. Juſtice <hi>Atkyns</hi> that was) that he ſhould recommend him to have a wonderful care of him, and then thank him for his kindneſs, ſhewed to <hi>Our Party:</hi> So he makes himſelf to be of the Party, and makes this the buſineſs of the Party, and ſo makes himſelf to be a ſharer in the buſineſs; for 'tis <hi>We thank you for your kindneſs to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s, and the Tide is ſtrong againſt <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s; and We hope we ſhall be able to bring the buſineſs of my Lord of</hi> Eſſex <hi>upon the Stage, before they do any of thoſe in the</hi> Tower. So Mr. <hi>Speke</hi> makes himſelf a Party in the buſineſs. And I am mighty ſorry that when he comes to be asked the Queſtion, How he came to Write this Letter, he ſhould tell us, He had been at the Tavern, and did not know what he Writ, but does not ſay he recollected afterwards It ſeems he uſed to be often at the Tavern, and had been there when he writ this Pious Letter, and ſo his Saintſhip broke out in a fit of Drunkenneſs, for moſt of our Reformers of Religion now adays, want common Morality. And yet they are wonderfully Zealous, for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:41249:40"/>
and Religion. All the Villany that has been thought of, nay, more than ever could enter before into the Imagination of Mankind, has been wrought by theſe Men, that pretend to be Reformers of Religion, and amongſt the reſt Mr. <hi>Bradden</hi>; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I look upon <hi>Bradden,</hi> to be the Daringeſt Fellow of the Party, he and his Brother <hi>Smith.</hi> If there were any Reluctancy, or any Senſe of any Guilt they had contracted, and would ſhew it, by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging their being ſurprized into it, and teſtifyed Repentance, by a Submiſſive and a Dutiful behaviour, that were ſomething to encline the Court to Commiſſeration, but when we ſee, inſtead of that, they are more obdurate and ſteeled in their Oppoſition to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, they muſt be reclaimed by Correction, and kept within due bounds, by condigne Puniſhment, otherwiſe it will be thought by the Ignorant ſort of People, that all Courts of Juſtice are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of them.</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi>Bradden,</hi> You ſee what it is you are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed of, It was for as fowl an Offence, as any can be imagined, that is not Capital, wherein the King is very much concerned, for the Inſinuations were ſuch, as that the King was mightily concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, for in as much as you ſay the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> ſhould be mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered at that time while the King was in the Tower, it was an implied accuſation of the King, and an inſinuation, that the King ſhould deſign to take away an innocent man's Blood, and ſo down-right be guilty of murdering an innocent Perſon, which how great an Offence that is, let any man that has any Loyalty, or Reverence for the King in him conſider, and you cannot ſay you are innocent, Mr. <hi>Bradden.</hi> Your proſecution was moſt pertinacious, and you would, proceed, even after the Boy had denied it, and proceed in ſuch a manner, when Sir <hi>Henry Capel</hi> had told you, what you ſhould do; and what did you go upon? You had got a little Girl, a Child of 11 or 12 years old, to tell a ſtory of I know not what, and no body elſe knew any thing of it, and this muſt be a ground ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for you to go up and down, and ſpread ſuch a Report, when Sir <hi>Henry Capel</hi> gave you adviſe to go to a Secretary of State, and let him examine it; indeed you did go to him, but would not reſt ſatisfied with what the King and Council did; no, Mr. <hi>Bradden,</hi> you thought that would not gratify your own paſſion, and malice, againſt the King and the Government, but you muſt take ways of your own. This is to ſcandalize the whole Juſtice of the Nation, and not only make the King a Murderer, but you would have all the Plot here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:41249:41"/>
by quite loſe its Credit; and you would make it, as Sir <hi>Samuel Bernardiſton</hi> would inſinuate, a ſham Plot to take away innocent Proteſtants lives. But as to the Plot, there has been freſh proof of it beyond all contradiction this day, a man here in the Face of the whole Court has owned the whole thing, he would not take the liberty of defending himſelf, that was offered him, if he would try it, but Confeſſed that Conſpiracy, which you had a great mind to be an Inſtrument of making the World to believe was nothing but a Sham. I ſhall not make any long Speech to you, The Court for this Offence,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sets upon you,</hi> Mr. Bradden, <hi>the Fine of</hi> 2000 l. <hi>and order that you find Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for your Good Behaviour during your Life, and that you be Committed till this be Performed. And for you Mr.</hi> Speke (<hi>we have conſidered that you are not ſo highly Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as Mr.</hi> Bradden, <hi>you are Guilty of a great Offence, but not ſo Guilty as he, and therefore) we think fit to ſet upon you the Fine of</hi> 1000 l. <hi>and that you find Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for your Good Behaviour, during your Life, and be Committed till you perform it.</hi>
