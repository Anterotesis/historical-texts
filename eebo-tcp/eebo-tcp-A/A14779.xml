            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Reason were it <hi>(AEneas)</hi> that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Graues of the dead should priuiledge their bodies from the tyrannie of the liuing: but by so much the lesse doe I esteeme my preiudice, by how much the more I knowe thee vnwittingly iniurious.

But the <hi>Greekes</hi> preuayling, Auerice, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clyning State of <hi>Phrigia,</hi> imboldned my Garden (fearlesse of Reuengers) to the murthering of me: which he traytrously accomplishing on this Shoore, secretly raked me vp in these Sands, without honor of better Sepulcher: and of my bodie (so hath it peased the Gods, and Nature) are sprong these Brau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ches, in tearing of which thou tormentest me. Howbeit, in respect of my desire to profite thee by fortelling of thy De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinie, I accoumpt me happely harmed: For knowe <hi>(AEneas)</hi> that in vayne thou doest builde, where the Gods denye thyne abode: leaue therefore these defamed Costes, and prosperously plant the Remayne of <hi>Troy,</hi> and thy Posteritie, in the fertill <hi>Italian</hi> Clime.</p>
               <p>The voyce thus ceased to speake, and <hi>AEneas,</hi> without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther touch of the forbidden Shrubbes, continuing his feare

Henceforward the Quéene to be admyred, not matched for her exquisite beauty, and rather borrowing of Arte then scanting Nature, as braue in apparell, as beautifull in person, and voted, euen in her better part, to the loue of <hi>AEneas,</hi> so sorted all her deuises to his best liking, that shortly him selfe laboured with her in one and the selfe same payne of wished for pleasure.

               <p>A hunting was generally appointed: the Queene, <hi>AEneas,</hi> their Ladies, and Knights brauely mounted: the Standes were prewned: the Toyles pitched: y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Hounds vncopled: the Game rowsed a foote, and followed: when suddainly amidst the harborlesse Desart in the hottest pursute, the Skye, ouercast with blacke Clowdes, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red downe such flashes of Lyghtning, vollies of Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Haylestones, and Rayne, that glad was euery of the <hi>Tyrians</hi> and <hi>Troians,</hi> dispersing themselues, to shyft for one, <hi>Elisa</hi> and <hi>AEneas,</hi> in the meanewhile, finding a Caue that sheltred them twayne.

When this swéete Calme in the sharpe storme, was with the Tempest thus ouerpassed, then came they both out, not such as they entred in: &amp; were receiued of their Traynes, attending their pleasures, not examining their pastimes: and so hauing continued the Chace, vntill night disconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued their sport, they retyring to <hi>Carthage,</hi> were sump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuously feasted of <hi>Elisa</hi> in her Pallace.

               <p>Shouldest thou beléeue (farre be it from <hi>AEneas</hi> so to beléeue) that the Oracles of our Gods, behighting vs the Conquest of <hi>Italie,</hi> were supersticious, then beléeue also (vndeceiued maist thou so beléeue) that our effeminate abode heere is vaine and slaunderous: to attempt that former without an Oracle, yea with the losse of our liues, is honourable, because we are <hi>Troians</hi>: to entertaine this latter, inuited and daungerles, reprochfull, because we are <hi>Troians.</hi> Ah <hi>(AEneas)</hi> haue we shipped our Gods from home, to be witnesses of our wantonnesse heere? Beléeue me, better had it béene we had dyed in <hi>Phrygia</hi> men, then to liue thus in <hi>Affric</hi> like women. Consider also the place whereinto wee are nowe broughte, and then conceaue of the possibility of our héere abode: shall I tell thée, were there not (if in the meane whyle no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Accident crosse thy now blisse) were there not I say, an <hi>Elisa</hi> héere to loue thée, or were there not an <hi>AEneas</hi> to be belooued of her, no sooner should the first deceased of you be deliuered of life, then the Suruyuors of vs <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ians</hi>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:11886:58"/>
be denyed thys Land: and then, if we should prooue so vngratefull as to resist our Releuors, yet hauing num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber we want Munition: for neyther our Shyppes bee tackled, nor wee armed, but at the deliuerie and appointment of the <hi>Tyrians.</hi> Learne therefore <hi>(AEneas)</hi> after so long pleasure in loue, at the last profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and politickly to loue: and whatsoeuer thy play be in <hi>Affrick,</hi> let henceforth the Mayne be <hi>Italie.</hi> Mean-while commaunde (most humbly we desire to bee so commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded) that thy Shyppes be secretely calked, tallowed, bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laced, tackled, victled, and armed: and then (thy selfe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so reformed) wittingly or vnwillinglie to <hi>Elisa</hi> leaue her and her effeminate Cittie: with resolution neuertheles (if thou so please) at more leysure to loue her. So effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allie did <hi>AEneas</hi> lysten to this motion, that gyuing order for the readines and secrete repayring of his Fléete, hee promised a spéedie and suddaine departure: and hys men not slypping opportunities, executed the same with as ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall diligence.</p>
               <p>It happened in thys meanewhyle, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Quéene to mount the high Turrets of her Pallace royal, where looking to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes the Rhode, she perceyued how earnestly the <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ians</hi> laboured in trymming, pauashing, and furnishing theyr Nauie: then assuring her selfe not deceiued, that she should be deceiued, and discending as it were maiestically madde, méeting with <hi>AEneas,</hi> she sayd.</p>
               <p>Before <hi>(AEneas)</hi> I beheld thy shypwracks and wants, I beléeued some God aryued at <hi>Carthage</hi>: yea when I knewe thée but a man, yet hath my conceit honoured thee with a Deitie: but nowe these thy inhumaine Treche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, not worthy the vnworthyest Tytles, argue so farre of from a Godhood, as thou shewest thy selfe lesse then a Man, and worse then a Deuill. What hath <hi>Carthage</hi> not woorthy <hi>AEneas</hi>? I assure thée, if any be so much, no Cittie is more happy then <hi>Carthage.</hi> But the Queene pleaseth not <hi>AEneas</hi>: oh that <hi>AEneas</hi> had not pleased the
<pb facs="tcp:11886:59"/>
Quéene: then might I haue bettered my choyse for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, or not haue bewayled thy chaunge for the dishonor. But (vngratefull) wilt thou indéede leaue me? yea, then that thou meanest the contrary nothing more false, but to deriue thy departure from any desert of myne, nothing lesse true. If therefore the life of <hi>Elisa,</hi> the loue of <hi>Elisa,</hi> the land of <hi>Elisa,</hi> her wealth, thy want, her teares, thy vowes, her distresse, thy dishonor, the delightes of thys Shore, the daungers of those Seas, <hi>Carthage</hi> possessed, <hi>Italie</hi> vnconquered, peace without warre héere, warre without peace there, thy wracks past, the Winter to come, anie euils whereof I warne thée, anie good that I haue wrought thée, and more good that I haue wished thée, if anie thing said, or more then I can say, hath or doth want Argument to seate thée in <hi>Affrick,</hi> yet at the least for thine owne safety, stay a more temperate season: vrging in the meane-while excuses, for thine vnurged departure: and so I flattered, shall either patient my selfe, or repent thy fléeting in a mylder Extasie. I did (wel may I forethinke me so to haue doone) entertaine thée be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the degrée of an Hostesse, or the dignity of a Gueste: and yet (vngratefull Guest to so kind an Holtis) for such welcome thou hast not pretended a farewell. Thus alas finding thy loue lesse then it ought, I repent to haue lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued more then I should: and because thou appearest not the same thou wert, I am not reputed the same I am: but as the by-worde of the <hi>Tyrians,</hi> the Stayle of the <hi>Troians,</hi> and the scorne of the <hi>Affricans,</hi> howbeit (in trueth) the fayth-plyghted Wyfe of faythlesse <hi>AEneas.</hi> But who will so beléeue? nay beleeue not so who wyll, thy departure shall bée my death, my death thy sinne, thy sinne the worldes spéeche, the worldes spéeche thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe, and thy reproofe my purgation: for were thy selfe Iuror and Iudge of the more offensyue, my credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie, or thine inconstancie, the Iuror coulde not but

               <p>
                  <hi>AEneas,</hi> not lightly gauled at her impatience, whom hee styll loued more then a lyttle, howbeit lesser then hys nowe regarde of honour, thankfully acknowledged her great bounty, counterpleading to haue pretended a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture without leaue taken, vouching moreouer the displeasure of hys Gods for contempt of their Oracles, manifested by fearefull Dreames and sundry Uisions, as also the vrging of hys <hi>Troians</hi> impatient of tarriance: so that hee resting in Resolution, not to bee wonne by wooing, or reclamed by exclaiming, the Quéene became spéechles and sencelesse, and was in a swoune conuayed from his presence: In which businesse hée boording hys Shyppes, in the deade of nyght hoysting vppe sayles, left <hi>Carthage</hi> to séeke <hi>Italie.</hi>
