            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>OMPLAINT having been made unto His Majeſty, by <hi>Don Alonco de Cardenas</hi> Ambaſſador from the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> that a Ship called the <hi>Sancta Clara</hi> belonging to the ſaid King and His Subjects, hath been lately treacherouſly brought to <hi>South-Hampton,</hi> by one Captain <hi>Bennet Strafford</hi> and others, from <hi>Sancto Domingo,</hi> the ſaid Ship being laden with Silver, Cocheneale, and other Wares and Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizes to a very great value; And that the ſaid Ship and Goods, being by the ſaid Ambaſſador arreſted, and the ſaid <hi>Bennet Strafford</hi> apprehended, whil'ſt a ſuite for the ſaid Ship and Goods is depending in the Court of <hi>Admiralty,</hi> the ſilver (part of the lading of the ſaid ship to a very great value) hath been diſpoſed of contrary to Law, without any other ſecurity given for the ſame, then the empty Name of publike Faith, which without His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty cannot (as is well knowne to all the world) be engaged, or if engaged without His Majeſty, is not valid, or to be relyed on for ſatisfaction. And it is further complained by the ſaid Ambaſſador, That the Cocheneale, and other Merchandizes formerly ſequeſtred at <hi>London</hi> and <hi>South-Hampton,</hi> albeit they are not periſhable, but have rather encreaſed in their Price and Value, are likely to be ſold againſt the Will of thoſe who pretend to be the Owners, (Parties to the ſuite depending in the ſaid Court of <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralty</hi>) which is alleadged to be apparently againſt the Rules of Law, and practices of that Court in ſuch Caſes. His Majeſty well weighing what may be the ill Conſequences of ſuch injurious Procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, manifeſtly contrary to the Law, and the Articles of Treaty between the two Crownes, and plainly foreſeeing how heavily it may light upon ſuch of His good Subjects, who have Eſtates in <hi>Spaine,</hi> and how deſtructive it may prove to the Trade and Commerce of His Subjects and Kingdomes, doth here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by not only expreſly Charge and Command the Judge of his <hi>Admiralty,</hi> and all others whom it may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne, to proceed in a Buſineſſe of ſuch Value and conſequence, with Care, Expedition, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Iuſtice; But doth alſo expreſly prohibite all perſons, of what condition ſoever, upon pretence of any Order or Warrant from one or both Hoſes of Parliament, or any Authority derived from thence, to buy, meddle with, or diſpoſe of any part of the ſaid Cocheneale, or other Goods or Merchandizes belonging to the ſaid Ship, untill the propriety thereof ſhall be judicially decided and determined, Upon paine of His Majeſties high Diſpleaſure, and of being reſponſible and lyable to payment and ſatisfaction for whatſoever damage ſhall happen to any of His Majeſties Subjects, whoſe Goods or Eſtates ſhall for that Cauſe be embargued or ſeized in <hi>Spaine.</hi>
