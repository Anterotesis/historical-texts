         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

were vſed and penned by the

may iustly challenge the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination,</hi>
as the remaines
of her Deuotion, who liuing
a Religious and Peereleſſe
<hi>PRINCE,</hi> was truely <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted</hi>
(as the <hi>Wiſe-man</hi>

head; and patient, when all
others reuiled, reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
beſpitted, ſcoffed, and
abuſed thee.</p>
               <p>Oh thou that ſo patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
&amp; peaceably, mildely, &amp;
meekely, didſt carry paine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and pangfull, haynous
and heauie ſorrowes for
mee: I beſeech thee, let

didſt truely take, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
beare with ſuch po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
&amp; innocency, informe
mine ignorance, comfort
my ſadneſſe, kindle my
loue, diſcharge my feare,
and moderate my anger.
O Lord, grant me patience

yet to continue in thy

and euer-liuing
GOD, whoſe
mercy is ouer all
thy workes, and of whoſe

and Grace for grace:
I poore SAMARITANE that
haue beene holpen, healed
and honoured by thy holy
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:3155:198"/>
Hand, doe poure foorth
my heart vnto thee, that I
may neither vngratefully

vngraciouſly forget thy ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere
iudgements, who both
in the one and the other,
haſt beene beyond all mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
ſo gracious vnto mee.
I thanke thee, O Lord, for
all the externall &amp; internall
graces beſtowed vpon mee,
the Spirituall and corpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
the Caeleſtiall and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtriall
bleſſings which I
haue receiued.</p>
               <p>And in earthly matters,
ô Lord, I acknowledge my
ſelfe deeply bounden vnto
thee, for my Being, brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:3155:199"/>
life, and motion.
That thou haſt made mee
of a more noble nature
then the reſt of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
creating mee after
thine owne Image, endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
mee with reaſon, furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing
me with excellent fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
of the minde, and
perfect ſenſe.</p>
               <p>And I giue thee thankes,
O LORD, that thou haſt
giuen mee a BODIE ſo
ſound and ſo free from
great infirmities, and haſt
ſet mee in a calling ſo fit

mee ſuch a competent

mee from ſo many

harmes in ſuch dangerous
accidents: as in ſicknes,
thunder, lightning, plague,

of theeues and rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
by Sea and Land,
attempted or intended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
my bodie, houſe, or

out of ſo many troubles
and vexations as I haue
fallen into.</p>
               <p>O Lord, how am I bound
vnto thee, that thou haſt
lent me ſuch kinde friends;
and that I liue in ſuch ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt

ſuch libertie of ſeemly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation,

ſuch quietneſſe of

in all my wayes.</p>
               <p>Theſe things (O Lord)
I enioy, though vnworthy,
by thy goodneſſe: whereas
there be many that haue
not found the like fauour
at thy hands, Bleſſed be
thy Name therefore. And
yet ô Lord, thou haſt been
much more gracious vnto
me: thy Spirituall fauours
and thy Caeleſtial bleſſings
exceed all theſe. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as I am bound, ſo,
much more I bleſſe thee,
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:3155:200"/>
that thou didſt elect me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all worlds to glorie:
that thou didſt worke my
redemption by the blood
of Chriſt Ieſus in his bitter
Paſſion: that I was borne
in the light of the Goſpel,
to know thee, and through
Sanctification in thee, haue
had the grace to take vpon
mee the profeſſion of the
Truth, to abandon all Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition
and Hereſie, to
doe good vnto any, and to
doe any thing that may
doe good, either publike
or priuate, &amp; in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
to keepe my ſelfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotted
of the world.</p>
               <p>Oh, what ſhall I giue
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:3155:201"/>
vnto my Lord, that hath
done ſo great and mightie
things for mee? O Lord,
I giue thee thanks that thou
haſt giuen mee ſuch an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Calling and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of Chriſtianitie, that
thou haſt incorporated me
a member of the Church,
giuing me ſuch a gracious
portion of Faith, hope,
loue, zeale, patience, peace
and ioy, the beginnings of
Regeneration.</p>
               <p>What am I (O Lord)
that thou haſt granted mee
ſuch things? to receiue
ſuch profite by the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of thy Word, and the
Priuiledge of thy bleſſed
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:3155:201"/>
Sacraments; to bee waſhed
with thy blood, to ſit at thy
Table, and to feed on thee
the euerlaſting Bread?</p>
               <p>Theſe I thanke thee for,
and for theſe alſo; euen for
my part which I haue in
the Communion of Saints;
for the benefit which I haue
of their Prayers in the
Church militant, the ayde
of their counſels, with the
pleaſure and comfort of
their godly examples, for
the bettering of my life:
that thou haſt giuen me a

to grow better.</p>
               <p>And in fine, I cannot
forget (O Lord,) thy mercy
of longanimitie and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
towards mee: That
thou haſt granted mee ſo
long and ſo large a time
of Repentance, and haſt
vouchſafed mee therein,
to haue thy Sonne IESVS
Chriſt, for my Mediatour,
by whoſe interceſſion my
Prayers haue acceſſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vnto

               <p>I prayſe thee, I glorifie

thy bleſſed Name, O
Lord, by whoſe goodneſſe
I want nothing fitte for a
