            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the moſt reuerend Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in God, Richard Biſhop of London, my verie good Lord, health and happineſſe heere, and in the world to come.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight reuerend my verie good Lord, euerie diuine knowes, that there is a ſtore-houſe in the Church of God, into which euerie good chriſtian brings ſome affliction ſuffered, or ſome trauell vndertaken for Gods ſake. And although that from <hi>Abel</hi> to Chriſt, and from Chriſt Ieſus to this preſent day, there haue beene many prizes of both ſorts carried into this treaſurie yet will it not be full before the ende of the world, vntill which time, neither the teares nor the trauels of the Church are like to ceaſe. Therfore ſeeing it hath pleaſed God of his goodneſſe to make mee a little Naile in his Temple, to hang ſome part of his ſeruice vppon, and hath from time to time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foorded me a place among many learned men, called out from their ſtudies in the Vniuerſities, or from their particular charges in the country,


<pb facs="tcp:12769:3"/>
to the publike ſeruice of the church at <hi>Paules</hi> Croſſe, where euerie man beſtirres him like a Bee, to carrie waxe and honny to the hiue, and euerie man is profitable in his paines: I haue brought in theſe labours to the church, fitted as well as I could, both to the time wherin we liue, and to that honourable aſſemblie to which I ſpake.</p>
            <p>And becauſe <hi>S: Auguſtine</hi> confeſſes, that when he beholdes men carried away with a loue of this preſent world, he cannot tel how wiſdome ſhould come in ſeaſon to do them any good, in that people blowen vp with proſperitie deſpiſe all that is ſaide vnto them: finding a great parte of the ancient glorie of this kingdome blaſted with the breath of ſchiſme, and with an expectation of warres and troubles, and eſpying alſo with the Prophet Ieremie, that there is no taking the wilde Aſſe in the wilderneſſe before ſhe be with foale, I haue ſlept in in ſuch a time, as wiſedom may happely come in ſeaſon.</p>
            <p>The matters I intreated of are great, and I am little, but God (which when he was great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came little to preach vnto the world) hath aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted me: and what I haue deliuered, men ſhall beſt ſee to be true, when reading and preaching ſhall be remooued, the cloude of this bodie rent in peeces, and wee with purified and glorified bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies


<pb facs="tcp:12769:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſhall looke vppon the Lorde. I knowe, that whilſt wee liue here below, as preaching is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared in the <hi>Reuelation</hi> vnto thunder, ſo it is like it in the cauſe and effects of thunder Thun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der proceedes from a vapor lifted vp from the earth, and compaſſed with a colde cloude, in the motion and agitation, it catcheth fire, which breaketh out preſently where the cloude is thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, and being out, ſometime it ſtrikes the bodie of a man, and not the cloathes, ſometime the cloathes, and not the bodie. Preaching proceedes from the meditation of the heart, lifted vp from earth to heauen, cold fleſh is the cloud that keeps it in in the motion and agitation of the minde, it catches fire, while I misſed (ſaith <hi>Dauid</hi>) the fire kindled, being ſtreightned within vs, it ſtriues to vente it ſelfe, and breakes out at the lippes of the preacher where the cloude is thinneſt and being forth, ſomtime it ſtrikes the princes of the earth, and not the people that ſtand about them: ſometime againe it hittes and mooues the poore people, and not the Potentates. When theſe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes of the almightie flie abroade, a preacher muſt not be diſmaide to ſee them glaunce in the going for they ſticke not euerie where.</p>
            <p>Nay, it falleth out ſometimes, that the hearers deale with vs, as <hi>Saul</hi> did with <hi>Dauid,</hi> who threw a ſpeare at him when he plaide vppon his

harpe, to charme the eiull ſpirite that was in <hi>Saul.</hi> Of which action it was wittily deuiſed and written by him that cutte the whole Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorie of <hi>Dauid</hi> for the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and ſette it out in pictures. Dura eſt mens hominis ac ſancto ingrata labori, <hi>The heart of man is harde, and vnkinde to holie labours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſpeake not this in reſpect of any crooked meaſure laide vnto my trauailes, for then I ſhould detract from that religious auditorie which gaue me gracious hearing &amp; acceptance, the glory ſhal be Gods, which wrought it in their hearts, and I truſt, their anſweres a rewarde to them in heauen, for the heede and regard they gaue vnto me. And that my ſermon might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine ſomewhat longer with them then the time wherein it was deliuered, I haue at the request of my friendes put it foorth in print, to the view of all, dedicating it vnto your Lo. partelie to ſubmit it to your L. graue and learned cenſure, and to the cenſure of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> according to the rule of the holie ghoſt, which will haue the ſpirits of the Prophets ſubiect to the Prophets: which courſe if euerie man could be content in humilitie to take, the controuerſies of our church would quikly be compoſed: partly to giue ſome publike teſtimonie of my thankeful heart and dutifull affection to your Lordſhippe,


<pb facs="tcp:12769:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which hath enabled me to do ſome good in the church of God, in ſome inferiour ſeruices therof, according to the talent beſtowed vppon me. Thus humblie beſeeching God, which is the beginning and the ende of all things, to giue peace to his church and to our country, and to bleſſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue your honourable labors in them both, and to crowne them in heauen when your race is runne, I humbly take my leaue.</p>

fourth is, vnaptneſſe to gouerne, becauſe the heathen are barbarous and vnfit to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne, and the lawe of Nature willes that ſuch ſhoulde bée ruled by wiſer than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues; <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, that warre vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken<note place="margin">4.

                  <p>As for the inſtance of the wars of Gods people vpon Idolaters, diuers titles haue bin ſifted, and ſoght out by diuers authors to iuſtifie them, of which I will yeeld you but two, both diſcouered in the ſcriptures.

landes and dominions temporall, neither Pope nor Emperour haue any thing to do. And <hi>Caietan</hi> auoucheth, that to giue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny<note place="margin">Q. 59. a. 8.</note> ſuch right to Pope or Emperour, is to take away the diſtinction of iuriſdictions, and to bring in a confuſion into the world. Laſt of all, how vntrue and erronious the fourth title is, may eaſilie appeare, in that many pagans and infidels are more ingenious, politike, and apt to gouerne, then many chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. Neither is it inough to iuſtifie the warre, that the people vpon whome the warre is made, are inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our in witte vnto the warriour, except they be ſo poore that they liue like bruite beaſtes, or feede vppon humane fleſh. In which caſe peraduenture it may bee lawfull to inuade them, not to kill them, as the Spaniardes did the naked Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, but to bring them in order to liue<note place="margin">1.

Yet is this either ſeldome or neuer to bee admitted, except vpon ſome occaſion of innocents or wrong, and the warre rather reuoked to a defenſiue, then an offenſiue warre.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:12769:11"/>The falſe titles excluded, there remaines but one iuſt in generall, that is, Neceſſitie. <hi>Nullum bellum iuſtum niſi neceſſarium.</hi> It may be iuſt and neceſſarie twoo wayes, the one is in defence of the innocent, the other is in reuenge of iniuries.

                  <p>THe third conſideration is of the perſons that concurre to the action of warre, which in this chapter are of foure ſortes,


<pb facs="tcp:12769:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Prince, the péeres, the prieſts and the common ſouldier. As warre muſt haue a iuſt title to make it lawfull, ſo it muſt alſo be vndertaken by lawfull authoritie, that is, the authority of the Prince, who as he carries the ſworde of Juſtice to puniſh do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſticall diſturbers of the common weale, in reſpect whereof he is ſaid <hi>Rom. 13.</hi> not to beare the ſworde in vaine: ſo he defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth his people from the ſorraine enimy by the ſworde of warre, and is bound ſo to do <hi>Pſal. 82. 4.</hi> He is charged to ſaue the poore and oppreſſed, from the hand of the wicked that oppreſſeth them. The reaſon of it is this, that as in a common weale it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite there ſhould be an authoritie, to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh offences, and to kéepe the ſame in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: ſo in the wide worlde, that all king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes and commonweales might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued, it is requiſit there ſhuld be a power &amp; authority to puniſh iniuries, this power reſting in no one Prince in the worlde as ſuperiour to al other Princes, war ſteps in in the place of iuſt vindicatiue iudgement, God hath left no other meanes vnto Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to flie vnto. Howſoeuer, this may ſéeme to bée controlde by ſcripture, and reaſon, in that <hi>Rom. 12.</hi> the Apoſtles councell is,


<pb facs="tcp:12769:13"/>
                     <hi>Render to no man euill for euill.</hi> And if priuate reuenge be not to be admitted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſelfe and ſame perſon is both a Judge and an actor in his owne cauſe, it may peraduenture be thought as vnfitte for a Prince to be a Judge and an actor in his owne cauſe. Yet is not the reuenge of a Prince cutte off by this. The Scripture <hi>Rom. 12.</hi> forbids priuate reuenge, becauſe Reuenge is an acte of vindicatiue Juſtice, which is <hi>Actus iuriſdictionis</hi> an acte of iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, which no priuate perſon obtaines by reaſon of any wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g done to him: neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, if reuenge be taken by authority, it is not only not forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the apoſtle, but commended as a thing neceſſarie, in that he ſaith, Princes and Magiſtrates are the<note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Princes &amp; priuate perſons in reuenge.</note> miniſters of God to take vengeance vpon them that doe euill. The argument drawn from a priuate perſon, holdeth not in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon with a Prince. A priuate perſon hath a ſpeedie waie to redreſſe his owne wrongs, by recourſe to the authoritie of his ſuperiours: a Prince hath no ſuperior vppon earth, nor any other redreſſe than warre if ſatiſfaction haue beene expected, and denied. A priuate perſon in taking re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge in his owne cauſe may excéede the

boundes of iuſtice, there is no ſuch feare in the perſon of a Prince, his authoritie is publike and adminiſterd by publike coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, whereby the affections of Princes are eaſily reſtrained: A priuate perſon cannot reuenge himſelfe, becauſe he may not be a Judge and an actor in his owne caſe; a Prince may be a Judge and an actor in his owne caſe: Princes are gods, the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of a prince is a little arme of the broad ſea of authority which is in God, &amp; as God reuenging the iniuries done to him and his kingdome, is a Judge and an actor in his owne caſe: ſo a Prince reuenging the iniuries done to him, and his dominions, may be a Judge and an actor in his owne caſe.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond ſort of perſons are the Péers,<note place="margin">2</note> which may be diuided into two rankes, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<note place="margin">The Peers</note> they are ſuch as are called to councell of ſtate, they are all bounde to giue faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful councell, not to deale with their maſter as <hi>Huſhai</hi> dealt with <hi>Abſalon</hi> when he taught him a trick to ouerthrow himſelfe, or ſuch as be leaders &amp; commanders in the fielde, and they are all bound to the acte of fortitude, to fight manfully, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for feare, nor flattery, nor corruption,

The Prophet <hi>Hieremie</hi> bleſſes him that takes this courſe, he likens ſuch a man to a trée, his truſt to the roote, Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to the ſap that lies continually at the roote to féede it and defend it.

I will giue you twoo examples of it in the Scripture. Euen in one night, when <hi>Ezechiah</hi> ſtoode in feare of all, and <hi>Rabſakeh</hi> thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſure of all, the whole armie of <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacherib</hi> was defeated by an Angell.

them open. We haue thrée rules in Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophie, that will make this plaine vnto you.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is, that where there be two a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents, a ſuperiour, and an inferiour, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour can neuer ouercome the ſuperiour, becauſe the ſuperiour is more actiue. Wée ſay in Philoſophie, that that is moſt actiue which is moſt ſeperated from earthly parts, moſt eleuated <hi>à materia.</hi> The phiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on diſtilles his ſimples into waters, hee makes his extractions and quinteſſences, that the more they bee eleuated <hi>à materia,</hi> they might be the more actiue, and worke the better. Water is ſtronger then earth, becauſe it is more actiue, and more eleua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>à materia.</hi> Fire is ſtronger then water, becauſe it is yet more actiue and eleuated <hi>à materia.</hi> You ſhall finde it in the ſacrifice of the Prophet, where the fire lickt vp the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, burnt the wood, and conſumed the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice: Angelles are ſtronger then men, becauſe they are much more eleuated <hi>à materia.</hi> God is ſtronger then the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelles, becauſe hee is moſt eleuated, hée is aboue earth, aboue water, aboue ayre, aboue fire, aboue men, aboue An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, aboue all, and ouer all <hi>Actus purus,</hi>


                     <pb facs="tcp:12769:27"/>
ſo ful of actiuitie, that none is able to inflict any paſſion vpon him. The ſecond rule is that <hi>variante materia, forma manet eadem,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the change &amp; alteration of your diet, according to the variation of the ayre, wherin you liue, your blood, your humors, your bodies, your complexions doe change and alter, but your ſoule is the ſame ſtill. A mans ennemie may cutte off a péece of his bodye, a legge, or an arme, but hee cannot cutte off a péece of his ſoule. Looke what the ſoule is to the bodie, that is God vnto his church: all the prophets and apoſtles, thouſands of holy and learned bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and preachers haue béene cutte off, ſome by perſecution, ſome by naturall death, yet religion ſtands, and the Church ſtands to this day, which is a ſigne that it is maintained by ſuch a forme as can not varie. Séeing then that all worldly things be tranſitorie, men vary, the times varie, the pollicies of warre varie, the weapons varie, the ſquares and orders of fight vary, the places of aduantage and diſaduantage varie, it is beſt truſting to ſuch an obiect as cannot varie: ſuch a one is God that hath <hi>eſſe quoddam magnum,</hi> ſuch a great and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uariable eſſence, that a man ſafely ſay vnto


<pb facs="tcp:12769:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
him <hi>Pone me iuxta te, &amp; manus cuiuſuis pugnet contra me,</hi> Lord ſet me by thee, &amp; then let e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery hand fight againſt me, I feare no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation. The third rule is this, <hi>Animalia multa agu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; patiuntur per phantaſiam,</hi> liuing creatures here beneath, doe many things, and ſuffer many things, by reaſon of their apprehenſion of their obiect. The ſheep at the firſt ſight of the wolfe apprehends him for a terrible obiect, and naturally feares &amp; flies him: the lion quite contrary apprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds no terror in the wolfe at all, but paſſes by him, and by all the beaſtes of the forreſt, with an honourable ſcorne and diſdaine of all.</p>
                  <p>About mans apprehenſion of feare or courage, the ſituation of his eie either ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth all, or marreth all. When you ſtand here below vpon the ground, and looke vp to the top of Paules, they that ſtand vpon the ſtéeple, appéere ſmall of ſtature to you, although they be tall &amp; great, and they that are next to you ſéeme great, by reaſon of the diſtance of the one, and the néereneſſe of the other: but if you ſtood vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the top of Paules and looked downe, then they that are aboue woulde ſéeme great, and they that are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath woulde ſéeme little: So is it with


<pb facs="tcp:12769:28"/>
men in the time of trouble, if their eyes be faſtned vpon the earth, their enemies wil appeare vnto them to be great and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and God which is ſo high will appeare little. Neuertheleſſe, if their eyes be in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, as <hi>Iehoſhaphats</hi> eyes were, <hi>2. Chro. 20. 12. Our eyes are towardes thee,</hi> and looke downe from thence vppon their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, God will appeare ſtrong and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and the enemie weake and withe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. I will giue you thrée inſtances of it in the ſcriptures. <hi>Numbers 13.</hi> Eſpialles were ſent out to diſcouer the land of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, ſome of them hadde a ſhéepes eye, they no ſooner ſawe the great ſtature of the Inhabitaunts, all Giants or Giants fellowes, the high wals of their citties rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching vp to heauen, but they were afraide, they tooke the people to be inuincible, &amp; the towns impregnable. <hi>Caleb</hi> quite contrarie hauing his eie in heauen vppon Gods power and promiſe, and looking downe thence vpon the people, and the Cities, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended no terror in them at al: let vs go vp (ſaith he) without doubt we ſhall ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them. <hi>Caleb</hi> had a Lions eye, he paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the people and their Cities with an honorable ſcorne of all. <hi>2.

Eſdras 4.</hi> there was a flattering courtier, that looking vpon the royall perſon of the King, helde a paradoxe that the King is the ſtrongeſt thing in the worlde, becauſe hée ſendeth out his war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours that ſlay and kill, and ouerthrow Caſtles, Townes, and Towers, and digge vp the mountaines as they go: but <hi>Eſa. 40. 22.</hi> the man of God apprehendeth no ſuch greatnes in kings &amp; princes, when they be compared with God: and looking downe from heauen vpon the Kings of the earth he ſaieth they be crickets in reſpect of God.

Euen then when they are in their chiefeſt ruffe, with their chariots, and horſe, &amp; men at armes marching to the battell, they are but as graſhoppers trouping out, ſkipping and leaping vppe and downe the field. By theſe things you may perceue that as <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> ſerpent did eate vp the ſerpents of the Inchanters, ſo Gods power deuoures and ſwallowes vp all the power and ſtrength of man.</p>
                  <p>There may be power where there is no ſkil to vſe it: If the Oxe knew his ſtrength<note place="margin">Gods knowledge.</note> he woulde not ſuffer a childe to driue him: if the horſe were priuie to his own force, he would not ſuffer a boy to ride him. But it is not ſo with God, as he hath might, ſo hée knowes when, and where, and how to vſe it, <hi>Iob 12. 13. With him is wiſedome and ſtrength.</hi> The Schoole menne ſay that hée knowes <hi>non entia,</hi> thinges that are not. They take it out of the fourth chapter to the <hi>Romans 17</hi> verſ. <hi>He calles things that are not as if they were.</hi> Theſe are of two ſorts, either ſuch as are not now in acte, but either haue béene in time paſſed, or ſhall be in time to come. A ſecond ſort of things that are not, is ſuch, as neither are nowe in acte, nor euer were, nor euer ſhall be.


<pb facs="tcp:12769:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Séeing then it is the cowardice of man, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in the times of warres, to feare many things that neuer were, nor are, nor ſhalbe, it is good at ſuch times to make God the onely obiect of our truſt which ſees and knowes, that many things which we feare ſhall neuer fall vpon vs.</p>
                  <p>Laſt of all there may be power and ſkill<note place="margin">Gods goodnes.</note> to helpe when there is no will to vſe it: let vs ſearch then whether God be as willing to ſuccor his people as he is powerfull and ſkilfull. Surely if he were not, he might be ſaide to be leſſe kinde vnto his children, than man and beaſt is vnto their young, they cheriſh their yong, they fight for them and defend them. Gods goodneſſe towards his people can not be deliuerd vnto you by a better hand than by the doctrine of his prouidence which includes both his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and his wil. Concerning which, ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there haue béene diuers errors, and I perceiue the dayes and times require they ſhould be touched and opened, I wil deale with them as the venerable Judges of our Country deale (in care and compaſſion of the Quéenes liege people) with thoſe attur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies whom they find to be looſe in the haft, and fitte for nothing but to diſquiet a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,

There be 6 of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in number. The firſt is, the error of the Stoikes, ſetting down a kind of prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce which they call Fate or Deſtiny, which runnes thorow a ranke of cauſes, &amp; brings in an abſolute and ineuitable neceſſity that pinions the armes and the actions of God and man. This error <hi>Theodoret</hi> diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in his ſirt book of curing the affections of the Gréekes, and <hi>Alphonſus de Caſtro</hi> in his ſeuenth booke of Hereſies, in two ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall Treatiſes, one of Fate, the other of Future contingent, beates the noſe of this error flat to the face of the deuiſers &amp; amin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers of it.

<pb facs="tcp:12769:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ninth chapter of <hi>Ezechiel</hi> that his eie ſhuld not ſpare them.

The fourth is, the errour of <hi>Rabbi Moſes</hi> the Jew, laide open by <hi>Tho. 1. p. q. 22. a. 2.

the other. Gods word is a fier, mens affections are water, when fier and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ioine, they begin to rattle and biſſe one at another.

The archer firſt takes a viewe of his marke, then conſiders the diſtance of the ground, after that he carries his eye ouer all the ſhafts in his quiuer, he pulles out, and puts in one after another, vntill hee haue made choyſe of his arrow: then hee prooues it with his finger, and iudges by his eare whether it bee drie and fitte to flie vnto the marke: then he markes how the winde ſittes, to helpe him or to hinder him: when he hath put his arrow into the bow, and begunne to draw, if there come a guſke of contradiction in his way, he hath the diſcretion to pawſe and to beare with it, vntill it haue ſpent it ſelfe: when the blaſt is ouer, he ſettes his foote to the grounde, lies cloſe to his bowe, drawes his arrow vp to the head, and ſticks it vp to the feathers. Either want of yeares for the act of generation, or want of growth to draw the bowe of the Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, &amp; want alſo of ſkill to ſhoote, and care to ſhoote when wee haue taken our aime, makes vs many times to miſſe the marke, and ſo we become deſpiſed.</p>

As many of you as take our proſperitie to bee a pricke in your eies, laye this to your heartes, and thinke vpon it. It grieueth me to ſpeake it, and it grieueth me more to thinke it: you may ſee it if you will, that whileſt you are whet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of a knife for to cutte our throates, God is whetting of a ſworde to cut your throats.</p>

                     <p>I remember the Prophet <hi>Hieremie</hi> in his fourth chapter and fourth verſ. finding his ſpeach to be of little force amongeſt the common people, ſaid thus to himſelfe: ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they are poore and fooliſh, and knowe not the way of the Lorde, I will get mée to the great men &amp; ſpeake to them, for they know it. But when he had taken a view of them, he confeſſed, that they alſo had caſt away the yoke of their obedience vnto god. This was not my drift at that time, neither is it my intent now. I do rather ſet before mine eies the complaint of the Prophet <hi>Hiere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie Lament. 3.</hi> where he compareth great perſons to fine gold, and to the ſtones of the ſanctuarie, and bewailes to ſée them in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace.

Yet I muſt tel you thus much, that as euery man hath a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular end of his actions, and embraceth all the honeſt meanes hée can to attayne to it; the end of the Marchant is gaine, the end of the Souldier is victorie: ſo the ende of the Preacher is Gods glorie: the means we vſe to attaine vnto it, is preaching, and preaching is haile-ſhot; we ſend it among the thickeſt of you, deſirous to hitte you all. And if we can ſtrike, and ſtrike kindly here a Judge, and there a Magiſtrate, héere a Nobleman, there a Gentleman, héere a Courtier, there a Countrieman, héere a Lawyer, there a Client, it fareth with vs as it did with the Troians, when the ſiege was raiſed, and the Grecians returned to their ſhips, they delighted to view the void places where they fought: when our work is ouer, it doth vs good as wée come this way, to caſt vp our eyes to theſe places where we haue tried our ſtrength in Gods

By this long con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tinuance of the goſpel among you, the king<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dome of heauen is nearer to you now than when you firſt beléeued: God ſtands at the end of your race, as he did at the top of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs</hi> ladder to allure you: put your truſt in him, and you ſhall be aſſured: he hath ſent out his Prophets and Preachers to halow the game vnto you, If you cling ſomwhat cloſe vnto vs, you ſhall mooue ſpéedily to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
