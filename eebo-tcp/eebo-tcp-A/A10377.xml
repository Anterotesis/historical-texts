            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

as hee hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
beene willing to bring them before
Sunne and Moone, and carefull to satisfie
all his good people with his Intentions

as to the present, true and vndisguised De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations
of them; as iudging, that for
Actions not well founded, it is aduantage
to let them passe in vncertaine Reports;
but for Actions, that are built vpon sure

the World, his proceedings in a case of
such a nature as this which followeth is;
since it not onely concernes his owne peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,

            <p>Accordingly therefore, for that which
concerneth Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> late execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for Treason (leauing the thoughts of
his heart, and the protestations that hee
made at his death to God that is the sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher

his Maiestie hath thought fit to manifest
vnto the world, how things appeared vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
himselfe, and vpon what Proofes and
euident Matter, and the Examination of
the Commaunders that were employed
with him, in the Voyage, (and namely of
those which Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> himselfe by
his owne Letter to Secretarie <hi>Winwood,</hi>
had commended for persons of speciall
worth and credit, and as most fit for grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
employments) his Maiesties procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
haue bin grounded, whereby it will
euidently appeare how agreeable they haue
beene in all points to Honour and Iustice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:15854:3"/>SIR <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> hauing beene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
of high Treason, at his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties
entrance into this Kingdome,
and by the space of fourteene yeeres, by his
Maiesties princely Clemency and Mercy,
not onely spared from his Execution, but
permitted to liue, as in <hi>Liberâ custodiâ</hi> in
the Tower, and to enioy his Lands and
Liuing, till all was by Law euicted from
him vpon another ground, and not by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture;
(which notwithstanding, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie
out of his abundant Grace gaue him
a competent satisfaction for the same) at
length, hee fell vpon an Enterprise of a
golden Mine in <hi>Guiana.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This proposition of his, was presented
and recommended to his Maiestie by Sir
<hi>Ralph Winwood,</hi> then Secretary of State, as
a matter not in the Aire, or speculatiue,
but reall, and of certaintie; for that Sir <hi>W.
Raleigh</hi> had seene of the Oare of the Mine
with his eyes, and tried the richnesse of it.
It is true, that his Maiestie, in his owne
princely iudgement, gaue no beleefe vnto
it; aswell, for that his Maiestie was verely
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:15854:4"/>
perswaded, that in Nature there are no
such Mines of gold entire, as they descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
this to bee; and if any such had beene,
it was not probable that the Spaniards,
who were so industrious in the chase of
Treasure, would haue neglected it so long;
as also for that it proceeded from the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of Sir <hi>Wal. Raleigh,</hi> inuested with such
circumstances both of his disposition and
fortune: But neuerthelesse Sir <hi>W. Raleigh</hi>
had so inchanted the world, with his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
asseueration of that which euery
man was willing to beleeue, as his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
honour was in a manner ingaged, not
to deny vnto his people the aduenture and
hope of so great Riches, to bee sought and
atchieued, at the charge of Voluntaries;
especially, for that it stood with his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
Politique and Magnanimous courses,
in these his flourishing times of peace, to
nourish and incourage Noble and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
enterprises, for Plantations, Discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and opening of new Trades.</p>
            <p>Heereupon the late Spanish Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour,
the <hi>Count de Gondomar,</hi> tooke
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:15854:4"/>
great alarme, and represented vnto his
Maiestie by loud and vehement assertions,
vpon iterated audiences, that he knew and
had discouered the intention and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise
of Sir <hi>W. Raleigh</hi> to bee but Hostile
and Piraticall, and tending to the breach
of the Peace betweene the two Crownes,
and danger and destruction of the King
his Masters Subiects in those parts; prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
in a sort against the same. To which
his Maiesties answere alwayes was, that he
would send Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> with a limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Commission, and that hee durst not vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
perill of his head attempt any such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
and if hee did, hee would surely doe
iustice vpon him, or send him bound hand
and foot into <hi>Spaine,</hi> and all the gold and
goods he should obtaine by Robbery, and
bring home, were they neuer so great. And
for further caution, his Maiesty enioyned
Secretary <hi>Winwood,</hi> to vrge Sir <hi>Walter Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh</hi>
vpon his conscience, and alleageance
to his Maiestie, to deale plainely, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
himselfe, whether hee had any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
intention, but onely to goe to those
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:15854:5"/>
golden Mines in <hi>Guiana,</hi> which hee not
onely solemnely protested vnto the saide
Sir <hi>Ralph Winwood,</hi> but by him writt a
close letter to his Maiestie, conteining a
solemne profession thereof, confirmed
with many vehement asseuerations, and
that hee neuer meant or would commit
any outrages or spoiles vpon the King of
Spaines Subiects. But notwithstanding,
his Maiestie acquainted the Spanish Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour
with this his protestation; yet
the said Ambassadour would neuer recede
from his former iealousie, and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuning
his Maiestie to stay his voyage, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadging
that the great number of shippes
that Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> had prepared for
that voyage, shewed manifestly, that hee
had no such peaceable intent; and offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
(vpon Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> his answere
thereunto, that those ships were onely
prouided for his safe conuoy) that if Sir
<hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> would goe with one or two
ships onely to seeke the said Mine, that
hee would mooue the King of Spaine to
send two or three ships with him backe
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:15854:5"/>
againe for his safe conuoy hither with all
his gold; And the said Ambassadours per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to remaine here in pledge for the King
his Master his performance thereof. But
such were the constant faire Offers of the
said Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh,</hi> and specious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
as his Maiestie in the end reiected
the importunate Suit of the said Spanish
Ambassadour for his stay, and resolued
to let him goe: but therewithall tooke
order, both that hee, and all those that
went in his company, should finde good
securitie, to behaue themselues peaceably
towards all his Maiesties Friends and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies;
and to obserue strictly all the Articles
of the Commission, which his Maiestie
for that cause, had the greater care to haue
it well and clearely penned, and set downe.
And that his Maiesties honest intention

And because that in
such and the like enterprises
and voyages, great inconueniences
haue growne by the mutinous and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly

for want of sufficient authoritie to

We doe therefore by these pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents

               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:15854:14"/>THis Commission so drawne and fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
(as as you see) his Maiestie himselfe
did oft peruse and reuise, as foreseeing the
future euents; the tenor whereof appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
to be so farre from giuing Sir <hi>Walter
Raleigh</hi> warrant, or colour to inuade any
of the Territories, occupate and possest
by the Spaniards, as it tended to a directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
rather of commerce, then spoile, euen
towards the Sauages themselues. And the
better to containe Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh,</hi> and
to hold him vpon his good behauiour, his
Maiestie denied (though much sued vnto
for the same) to grant him pardon for his
former treasons, both to disauthorise him
with those, that were vnder his Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand,
(in case he should attempt to exceede his
Commission) and to reserue him to the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
of the Law, if by new offences hee
should make himselfe indigne of former
mercies. And as for the good securitie
which his Maiestie ordered to be taken,
for their good and peaceable behauiour in
the voyage; his Maiestie neuer heard any
thing to the contrary but that it was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:15854:15"/>
till they were vpon their parting;
and then was it told him, that euery one
of the principals that were in the voyage,
had put in security one for another, which
if his Maiestie had knowen in time, hee
would neuer haue accepted of.</p>
            <p>But howsoeuer the Commission was
penned; and whatsoeuer the cautions
were which his Maiestie intended or v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
and whatsoeuer the protestations and
promises were, that Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi>
made or exhibited, it appeareth plainely,
by the whole sequell of his Actions, that
he went his owne way, and had his owne
ends: First, to procure his libertie, and
then to make new fortunes for himselfe,
casting abroad onely this tale of the Mine
as a lure to get aduenturers and followers;
hauing in his eye the <hi>Mexico</hi> Fleete, the
sacking and spoyle of Townes planted
with Spaniards, the depredation of Ships,
and such other purchase; and making ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
that if he returned rich, hee would
ransome his offences (little looking into
the nature and Character of his Maiesties
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:15854:15"/>
Iustice and gouernment) and if otherwise,
he would seeke his fortune by flight, and
new enterprises in some forraine Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.</p>
            <p>In execution therefore of these his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes,
Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> carrying the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of an actiue, wittie, and valiant
Gentleman, and especially of a great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
at Sea, by the inticement of this
golden baite of the Mine, and the estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his owne name, drew vnto him
many braue Captaines, and other Knights
and Gentlemen of great blood and worth,
to hazzard and aduenture their liues, and
the whole, or a great part of their estates
and fortunes in this his Voyage: whose
ruines and decayes following, remaine as
sad and grieuous reliques and monuments
of his vnfortunate iourney, and vnfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
proceedings.</p>
            <p>But before hee went from <hi>London,</hi> hee
was not so reserued, nor so constant vnto
his pretence of the Mine, but that some
sparkes brake foorth of that light, which
afterwards appeared. For hee cast foorth
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:15854:16"/>
some words to some particular friends of
his Company, That hee knew a Towne in
those parts, vpon which hee could make
a sauing Voyage in <hi>Tobacco,</hi> though there
were no other spoile. Neuerthelesse, to
make the better faith of that he had giuen
out touching the Mine, he promised his
Companie at <hi>London,</hi> that when he came
to <hi>Plimouth,</hi> hee would take a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of Pioners out of the West, (where
best workemen are of that kind) and hee
maintained this his pretence so farre, as
hee billited the sayd Pioners for seuerall
ships; but when he came into the West this
vanished. For it is testified of all parts, and
by himselfe confessed, that he carried none
at all, excusing it, that there were many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
tall men of the Mariners, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Souldiers, that he would haue made
fall to worke; which is a slender excuse of
omitting so principall a point. As for
Pickeaxes, Mattockes and Shouels for the
working of the Mine, it is true he carried
some small quantitie for a shew, but by the
iudgement of all that were in his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:15854:16"/>
nothing neere sufficient for that which
had been requisite for the working of the
Mine, which be excused onely by saying,
that his men neuer saw them vnpacked,
and that the Mine was not past a foote and
a halfe vnder ground.</p>
            <p>After, when hee was once at Sea, hee
did not much labor to nourish and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
the beliefe, that be meant to make his
voyage vpon the profite of the Mine, but
fell a degree, as if it were sufficient to
bring home certainty and visible proofe,
that such a Mine there was, though hee
brought not the riches of it. For soone
after his setting foorth from <hi>Ireland,</hi> hee
professed, that if hee brought home but a
handfull or basketfull of Oare, to show the
King, hee cared for no more, for it was
enough to saue his credit; and being char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
therewith, hee confessed the speech,
with this argument and inference, that if
there had beene a handfull of the Mine, it
followed there was a Mine to be confessed;
as if so many Ships, so many liues of men,
such charge of prouisions, and such an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:15854:17"/>
Commission, had beene but for
an experiment.</p>
            <p>About the same time likewise, he began
to forget his Commission, aswell as his
pretences of the Mine; for hee did declare
himselfe to diuers of his company, that hee
meant to take St. <hi>Thomé,</hi> and that he would
make his voyage good vpon that Towne,
for that it was very rich; So as where it was
blowne abroad, that the assault of Saint
<hi>Thomé</hi> was inforced by a kinde of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
for that our Troupes were first assailed,
it appeareth manifestly, both by his speech
at <hi>London,</hi> of a Towne indefinitely, and by
this his speech earely in his voyage at Sea
of St. <hi>Thomé</hi> by name, that it was an origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
designe of his from the beginning:
And yet it is confessed by all, that the parts
of <hi>Guiana,</hi> where St. <hi>Thomé</hi> was scituate,
were planted by Spaniards, who had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
Townes in the same tract, with some
Indians intermixed, that are their Vassals,
so as it is plaine, both place and persons
were out of his Commission.</p>
            <p>And that this was well knowne to him
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:15854:17"/>
it appeares notably in a letter of his owne
hand, written since his returne from his
voyage, wherein hee complaines, that the
Spaniards of the same place did murder
diuers of his men, which came in peace to
trade with them, some seuen yeeres past;
neither doeth he in that letter, any way de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
his knowledge, that those parts Were
inhabited by the Spaniards, but stands vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a former title, which hee would needs
now haue strengthened by a new possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
notwithstanding that this his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
is no way competible with his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
and that himselfe before his going
neuer made ouerture, or allegation of any
such pretext, nor so much as intimated, or
insinuated any such designe or purpose.</p>
            <p>Againe, before hee came to the
Islands, hee made no difficultie to tell ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
in expresse termes, that hee meant to
surprise and set vpon the <hi>Mexico</hi> Fleete,
though sometimes hee would quallifie it,
by saying, <hi>If all failed, or if the Action of
the Mine were defeated.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> himselfe being
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:15854:18"/>
charged with these speaches, confessed
the words, but saith, that in time, they
were spoken after the Action of the Mine
was defeated; and that it was propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by him, to the end, to keepe his men
together, and if he spake it before, it was
but discourse at large.</p>
            <p>After, when hee began to be vpon the
approaches of his pretended designe of
the Mine, and was come to <hi>Trinidad,</hi>
hee fell sicke in some extremitie, and in
doubt of life (as was thought) at what
time hee was mooued by some principall
persons about him, vpon two points, in
case hee should decease: The one, that
hee would nominate a Generall to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
him; The other, that hee would
giue some direction for prosecution of the
Action of the Mine. To the first hee
made answere, that his Commission could
nor bee set ouer, and therefore left them
to agree of that among themselues: but
for the Mine, hee profest hee could giue
them no direction; and stayed not there,
but told them, there was another course
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:15854:18"/>
(which hee did particularize vnto them to
bee a French Commission, whereby they
might doe themselues most good vpon
the Spaniards.</p>
            <p>When hee was vpon recouerie, he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched
the Land-forces pretended for
the Mine, and had designed Captaine
<hi>Sentleger</hi> to command in that Expedition:
but by reason of <hi>Sentlegers</hi> infirmitie at
that time, he resorted to his kinseman
Captaine <hi>George Raleigh,</hi> who was his
Sergeant Maior; in whose written Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
which he gaue him, he was wary
enough not to expresse the taking of St.
<hi>Thomé,</hi> but onely inserted a clause of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement;
<hi>That they should in all things o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
him, as they would doe to himselfe in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:</hi>
yet in priuate directions and instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
hee did open himselfe to diuers of
his Company, that in case they should
not receiue some aduertisment, that the
Towne was reinforced by new supplies of
men (whereby the enterprise might bee of
too great hazard for their number) they
should take the Towne first, telling them,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:15854:19"/>
that the Mine was but three miles distant
short of the Towne, and inferring (as
<hi>Kemish</hi> expounded it afterwards) that it
was in vaine to meddle with the Mine, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the Towne were first taken, and the
Spaniards chased; for that otherwise, they
should but discouer it, and worke it for
the Spaniards: and when hee had opened
himselfe thus farre, some of his company,
of the more intelligent and duetifull sort,
did in plain terms turn it vpon him, setting
before him, that the taking of the Towne,
would breake the Peace, and that they
should goe against the Commmission:
Whereupon, most falsly and scandalously,
hee doubted not with confidence to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme,
that he had order by word of mouth
from the King and his Councell, to take
the Towne, if it were any hinderance to
the digging of the Mine.</p>
            <p>But the euent did sufficiently expound
and manifest the direction; and yet that
kinde of interpretation little needed, for
that yong M. <hi>Raleigh,</hi> (who was likest to
know his fathers secret) when he ledde his
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:15854:19"/>
souldiers vpon the Towne, vsed these or
the like words, <hi>Come on my hearts, here is the
Mine that ye must expect, they that looke for any
other Mine, are fooles;</hi> And with this did
well concurre that which followed, in the
prosecution of the Mine after the Towne
was taken; For this Mine was not onely
imaginary, but moueable, for that which
was directed to bee 3. miles short of Saint
<hi>Thomé,</hi> was after sought 30. miles beyond
S. <hi>Thomé.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All this while Sir <hi>W. Raleigh</hi> staied at
<hi>Pont degallo,</hi> by the space of some 9. weekes,
during which time it was much noted by
those that remained with him, that the
speech of the Mine was dead, (wheras men
in expectation do commonly feede them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
with the talke of that they long to
heare of;) Nay more, after he had receiued
newes of the taking of the Towne, which
had beene the fittest time to pursue the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize
of the Mine, (in regard the Towne
that might haue beene the impediment
was mastered) hee neuer entertained any
such designe, but contrariwise, hauing
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:15854:20"/>
knowledge at the same time, that his son
was slaine, (who as it seemes was his onely
care amongst the Land souldiers) he did
mooue very inhumanly, to remooue not a
little from <hi>Pont degallo</hi> to <hi>Port-hercule</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the danger of the Current (as hee
pretended) but to goe for the <hi>Charibes</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
leagues off; accompting (as it seemeth)
the land Souldiers, but as <hi>fruges consumere
natos,</hi> and hauing his thoughts onely vpon
Sea forces, which how they should haue
beene imployed, euery man may iudge.
And whereas some pretence is made by
him, as if hee should leaue some word at
<hi>Pont degallo</hi> of direction, to what place the
land Souldiers should follow him; it is
plaine, he knew them at that time so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed
for victuall, as famine must haue
ouertaken them, before they could ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
him; at which time one of his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
told him, that he had deliuered out
52. men to that seruice, which were then
at the enterprize on Land, whose liues hee
held at a deare rate, and that he would not
weigh Anchor, as long as he had a Cable
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:15854:20"/>
to ride by, or a Cake of bread to eate: So
Sir <hi>W. Raleigh</hi> finding no consent in that
which hee propounded, that cruell pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
was diuerted.</p>
            <p>It was also much obserued, that after
that vnfortunate returne of <hi>Kemish,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
Sir <hi>W. Raleigh</hi> did publique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
giue out, that hee would question him
for failing to prosecute the Mine, hee had
him at Dinner, and Supper, and vsed him
as familiarly and as kindly as before. And
to <hi>Geo. Raleigh</hi> the Sergeant Major, to
whom he did vse the like discountenances
in publique, who tooke it more tenderly,
and complained, and brake with him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
it; he did open himselfe more plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
telling him that hee must seeme to doe
as much as he did, to giue satisfaction.</p>
            <p>After all this, when the prosecution of
this imaginarie Mine vanished, and was
defeated, and that his Company cast a sad
eye homewards, finding they were but
abused, Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> called a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
of his Captaines, and helde the same
in his Cabbine, where hee propounded to
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:15854:21"/>
them, that his Intention and designe
was; First, to make to the New-found
lands, and there to revictuall and refresh
his Ships; And thence to goe to the We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterne
Islands, and there to lie in waite to
meete with the <hi>Mexico</hi> Fleete, or to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise
some Carrackes; and so hauing got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
treasure, which might make him wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
into any forreine Countrey, to take
some newe course for his future for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
valuing himselfe as a man of
great enterprise, and fame abroad; but
then and at diuers times, hee did directly,
and openly declare, that it was no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
for ENGLAND, for that he knew
not how things would be construed, and
that he (for his part) would neuer put his
head vnder the Kings girdle, except hee
first saw the great Seale for his pardon.</p>
            <p>At which time, his cogitations imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
East and West, rather then any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
into his Countrey, hee did in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
make promise to a principall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
in his Company, to giue him a
Ship to goe into the East Indies, if hee
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:15854:21"/>
would accompanie him thither. But ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his first proiect, hee went to
the New found Land, which hee needed
not to haue done, if his purpose had been
for <hi>England,</hi> (for that hee had victuals e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
and to spare, for that iourney) and
there at New found Land his other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
hauing formerly dispersed and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken
him, his owne companie which was
in his owne Ship began likewise to mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine.
And although some old Pirates, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by his inciting, or out of feare of
their owne case, were fierce and violent
for the Sea, and against the returne, yet
the far greater number were for the return;
at which time himselfe got aland, and
stood vpon the Sea banke, ànd put it to a
question, whether they should returne for
<hi>England,</hi> or land at New found Land:
Whereupon there was a diuision of voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
the one part to the <hi>Starreboard,</hi> and
the other to the <hi>Larboard;</hi> of which that
part which was for the returne for <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
was two parts of three, and would by
no meanes be drawen to set foote on land,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:15854:22"/>
but kept themselues in the Ship, where
they were sure they were masters; which
hee perceiuing, for feare of further muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,
professed in dissimulation, that hee
himselfe was for the returne into <hi>England,</hi>
and came and stood amongst them that
had most voyces; But neuerthelesse, after
that he despaired to draw his companie to
follow him further, hee made offer of his
owne Ship (which was of great value) to
his company, if they would set him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board
a French Barque: The like offer he
made, when hee came vpon the Coast of
<hi>Ireland,</hi> to some of his chiefe Officers
there.</p>
            <p>But about the time of his arriuall vpon
the coast of Ireland, the forcing and sac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of Saint <hi>Thomé,</hi> and the firing of
the Towne, and the putting the Spaniards
to the sword, was noysed abroad in all
parts, and was by speciall aduertisement
comne vnto the knowledge of the
<hi>Count de Gondomar,</hi> then Ambassador for
the King of Spaine with his Maiesty, who
therevpon prayed audience of his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:15854:22"/>
and with great instance demanded Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
against the persons, and their goods
(who had committed those outrages and
made those spoyles vpon his Maiesties
subiects) according to his Maiesties pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
and the treaty of Peace. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Maiestie published his Royall Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation
for the discouery of the truth
of <hi>Raleighs</hi> proceedings, and the aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Iustice. Notwithstanding all
which, his Maiestie vsed a gracious and
milde course towards Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh,</hi>
sending downe Sir <hi>L. Stucley</hi> Vice-admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
of the Countie of Deuon, to bring
Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> in faire manner, and as
his health would giue leaue, by easie iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyes
to <hi>London.</hi> For about this time
Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> was comne from <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
into <hi>England,</hi> into the Port of <hi>Plimouth,</hi>
where it was easie to discerne with what
good will hee came thither, by his imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
attempt to escape from thence; For
soone after his comming to <hi>Plimouth,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hee was vnder guard, he dealt with
the Owner of a French Barque (pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:15854:23"/>
it was for a Gentleman a friend of his)
to make ready his Barque for a passage,
and offered him twelue Crownes for his
paines: And one night he went in a little
Boate to haue seene the Barque that should
haue transported him, but the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
verie darke, hee missed of the Barque,
and came backe againe, nothing done;
wherein by the way appeares, that it was
not any traine laide for him by Sir <hi>Lewis
Stucley</hi> or any other (as was voyced) to
mooue or tempt him to an escape, but
that hee had a purpose to flie, and escape
from his first arriuall into <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in this his purpose, he grew to be more
resolute, and fixed, after that the Lords of
his Maiesties Councell, obseruing the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laies
in his comming vppe, had sent vnto
<hi>Stucley,</hi> some quicke letters for the haste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
thereof: But thereupon, as his desire
of escape encreased, so did the difficulty
thereof increase also; for that <hi>Stucley</hi> from
that time foorth kept a better guard vpon
him, whereof he tooke that apprehension,
in so much as (knowing <hi>Stucley</hi> to bee
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:15854:23"/>
witty and watchfull) hee grew to an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
that it would bee impossible for him
to escape, except hee could winne one of
these two points; either to corrupt <hi>Stuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi>
or at lest to get to haue some liberty,
when he came to London, of remayning
in his owne house; for guiltinesse did tell
him that vpon his comming to London, it
was like hee should bee laid prisoner in the
Tower. Wherefore he saw no other way,
but in his iourney to London, to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit
sickenesse in such a manner, as might
in commiseration of his extremity, moue
his Maiesty to permit him to remaine in
his owne house, where he assured himselfe
ere long, to plot an opportunity of an es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape:
And hauing in his company one
<hi>Mannowry</hi> a French man, a professor of
Physicke, and one that had many <hi>Chymicall</hi>
receipts, hee practised by Crownes, and
promised to draw him into his consort, the
better to make faith of his counterfeiting
to be sicke: the story whereof, <hi>Mannowry</hi>
himselfe reporteth to haue passed in this
manner.</p>

                        <p>VPon Saturday the 25. of Iuly, Sir <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Raleigh,</hi> Sir <hi>Lewis Stucley,</hi> and <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noury</hi>
went to lie at Master <hi>Drakes,</hi> where
the Letters of Commission from the Priuie
Councell were brought vnto Sir <hi>Lewis Stucley,</hi>
by one of his Maiesties messengers, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
a sudden departure, with much more haste
then was expected before: and the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of <hi>Sir Walter Raleigh</hi> was much changed
after Sir <hi>Lewis Stucley</hi> had shewed the Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
for <hi>Mannowry</hi> sawe him from the staire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
(hee beeing alone in his chamber, the
doore standing halfe open) how hee stamped
with his feete, and pulled himselfe by the haire,
swearing in these words, <hi>Gods wounds, is it
possible my fortune should returne vpon me thus
againe?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>From Master <hi>Drakes</hi> they went on their iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
to the house of Master <hi>Horsey,</hi> distant from
thence foure miles, or thereabouts. It was in
that houre that Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> began first to
cause <hi>Mannowry</hi> to bee sounded, what was in
his heart, by an olde domesticke of his called
Captaine <hi>King,</hi> who there began to discourse
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:15854:25"/>
vnto <hi>Mannowry</hi> of the infortunitie of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
and amongst other things, sayd thus; <hi>I
would wee were all at</hi> Paris, To whome <hi>Mannow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
answered, <hi>I would wee were all at</hi> London,
<hi>alas, what should wee doe at</hi> Paris? <hi>Because,</hi> quoth
King, <hi>that as soone as wee come to</hi> London, <hi>they
will commit Sir</hi> Walter Raleigh <hi>to the Tower, and
cut off his head:</hi> Whereupon <hi>Mannowry</hi> answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
That hee hoped better then so, and that
hee was sorrie for his ill fortune; and that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his small abilitie, hee was ready to doe
him all honest seruice hee could, so it might bee
done without offence.</p>
                        <p>After dinner, it being Sunday, Sir <hi>Walter Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh</hi>
departed from Master <hi>Horsey</hi> his house,
and went to <hi>Sherburne,</hi> and in the way when
hee came within view thereof, turning to <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowrie,</hi>
and shewing him the place and the
territorie about it, hee sayd vnto him sighing,
That all that was his, and that the King had vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iustly
taken it from him. Hee and <hi>Stucley</hi> lay not
at <hi>Sherburne,</hi> but were inuited to the house of
olde Master <hi>Parham: Mannowry</hi> and their traine
went to lie at <hi>Sherburne,</hi> at the signe of the
George. The next day, being Munday, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
and twentieth of Iuly, <hi>Mannowry</hi> went to
them, and from thence they tooke their way to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Salisbury,</hi> fiue and thirty miles from <hi>Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne;</hi>
and arriuing there, Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
afoote downe the hill, addressed himselfe
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:15854:25"/>
vnto <hi>Mannowry,</hi> and asked him if hee had any of
his Vomits, or other Medicines; which hee tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
him that he had, he prayed him to make one
ready against the next morning, and to tell no
body therof. <hi>I know (quoth he) that it is good for me
to euacuate many bad humours, &amp; by this means I shall
gaine time to worke my friends, giue order for my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires,
and, it may bee, pacifie his Maiesty before my
comming to</hi> London; <hi>for I know well, that assoone
as I come there, I shall to the Tower, and that they will
cut off my head, if I vse no meanes to escape it; which
I cannot doe, without counterfeiting to be sicke, which
your vomits will effect, without suspicion.</hi> For which
cause the same euening, as soone as he arriued, he
laide him downe vpon a bedde, complayning
much of his head, and blaming his great dayes
iourney from <hi>Sherborne</hi> to <hi>Salisbury,</hi> (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
he supped very well) but after supper
hee seemed to bee surprised with a dimnesse of
sight, by a swimming or giddinesse in his head,
and holding his hand before his face, hee rose
from his bed, and being ledde by the arme by Sir
<hi>Lewis Stucley,</hi> hee staggered so, that hee strooke
his head with some violence against a post of the
gallery before his Chamber, which made Sir
<hi>Lewis Stucley</hi> thinke that hee was sicke indeed;
in which beleefe <hi>Mannowry</hi> left him for that
time.</p>
                        <p>The next day in the morning, he sent his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
his wife, and most of his seruants to <hi>London,</hi>
                           <pb n="48" facs="tcp:15854:26"/>
and also Captaine <hi>King:</hi> and <hi>Cuthbert</hi> and <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowry,</hi>
and Sir <hi>Lewis Stucley</hi> being in <hi>Stucleyes</hi>
chamber, a seruant of the saide Sir <hi>Walter</hi> named
<hi>Robine,</hi> came and told them that his Master was
out of his wittes, and that hee was naked in his
shirt vpon all foure, scratching and biting the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes
vpon the Plankes, which greatly pitied Sir
<hi>Lewis Stucley,</hi> who rising in haste, sent <hi>Mannow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
to him, who when hee came, found him got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
againe to his bed, and asking him what he ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
he answered, he ailed nothing, but that hee
did it of purpose. And Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> asking
him for his vomit, hee gaue it him, who made
no bones, but swallowed it downe incontinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie:
At which time Sir <hi>L. Stucley</hi> comming in,
Sir <hi>Walter</hi> began againe to crie and raue; Then
<hi>Mannowry</hi> went out of the Chamber, and the
vomit which hee had giuen him was an houre
and a halfe before it wrought, but in the meane
time Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> beganne to drawe vp his
legges and armes all on a heape, as it had beene
in a fit of Conuulsions, and contractions of his
Sinewes; and that with such vehemencie, that
Sir <hi>Lewis Stucley</hi> had much adoe with the helpe
of others to pull out streight, sometimes an arme,
sometimes a legge; which against all the strength
they had, he would draw vp againe as it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
whereat the sayd Sir <hi>Lewis Stucley,</hi> tooke
great compassion, causing him to be well rubbed
and chafed; which Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> himselfe
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:15854:26"/>
afterwards told vnto <hi>Mannowry,</hi> laughing that
he had well exercised Sir <hi>Lewis Stucley,</hi> &amp; taught
him to be a Physitian.</p>
                        <p>This fained fitte being thus past, Sir <hi>Walter
Raleigh</hi> called <hi>Mannowry,</hi> and when he came, hee
prayed him to stay by him, and said hee would
take some rest. <hi>Mannowrie</hi> shut the doore, and
being alone with him, Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> tolde
him, That his vomite had done nothing as yet,
and said, that hee would take another more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent;
but <hi>Mannowry</hi> assuring him, that without
doubt it would worke, hee contented himselfe,
and asked <hi>Mannowry</hi> if hee could inuent any
thing, that might make him looke horrible and
loathsome outwardly, without offending his
principall parts, or making him sicke inwardly:
<hi>Mannowry</hi> studied a little, and then tolde him,
that hee would make a Composition presently,
of certaine things which would make him like
a Leper from head to foote, without doing him
any harme, which at his intreatie hee effected
speedily; at which time Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi>
gaue him the reason, why hee did it, telling him
that his beeing in that case, would make the
Lords of the Counsell affraide to come neere
him, and mooue them with more pitie to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
him. Soone after that <hi>Mannowry</hi> had put
this Composition vpon his Brow, his Armes,
and his Breast, Sir <hi>Lewis Stucley</hi> came into the
Chamber, and <hi>Mannowry</hi> went away, and Sir
<hi>Lewis Stucley</hi> perceiuing the places where <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowry</hi>
                           <pb n="50" facs="tcp:15854:27"/>
had put this Composition to be all pim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled,
his face full of great blisters of diuers co<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lours,
hauing in the middest a little touch of yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
and round about like a purple colour, and
all the rest of his skinne as it were inflamed
with heare, hee beganne to apprehend the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of the disease, that it was contagious, and
being very much astonished at the suddaine acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
he asked <hi>Mannowry</hi> what he thought there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
but <hi>Mannowry</hi> iudged it fit to conceale it from
him at that time, seeing Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> had
not yet tolde him, that hee meant to flie out of
<hi>England,</hi> but that it was onely to gaine time to
satisfie his Maiestie.</p>
                        <p>Vpon <hi>Mannowry</hi> his vncertaine answere to
Sir <hi>Lewis Stucley</hi> touching Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> his
maladie, <hi>Stucley</hi> resolued to goe to my Lord Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of <hi>Elie,</hi> now of <hi>Winchester,</hi> to relate vnto
him in what case Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> was, and
brought vnto <hi>Raleigh</hi> two Physicians to see and
visite him; who being come, could tell nothing
of what humour the saide sickenesse was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed.
There came also a third, a Bachelour in
Physicke, who all could not by all that they
could doe, discouer this disease; Onely they
gaue their opinion and aduise, that the Patient
could not be exposed to the Ayre, without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
perill of his life, and thereof they made
their report in writing, vnto which <hi>Mannowry</hi>
also set his hand.</p>
                        <p>Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh,</hi> seeing that all these things
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:15854:27"/>
fell out according to his intention, was excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
contented thereat, especially that in
the presence of the sayde Physicians, the vomit
beganne to worke both vpwards and downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.
And because he doubted that the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians
would aske to see his water, hee prayed
<hi>Mannowry</hi> to doe something to make it seeme
troubled and badde; which to content him,
(giuing him the Vrinall into his bedde) <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowry</hi>
rubbed the inside of the glasse with a
certaine Drugge, which as soone as hee had
made water therein, the Vrine euen in the hands
of the Physicians, turned all into an earthy hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
of a blackish colour, and made the water
also to haue an ill sauour, which made the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians
iudge the disease to be mortall and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
remedy, but from Heauen.</p>
                        <p>Hee made <hi>Mannowry</hi> also to tie his armes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
with blacke silke ribband, which hee tooke
from his Poyniard, to trie if it would distemper
the pulse, but that succeeded not, as hee thought
it would. The day following hee called <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowry,</hi>
and prayed him to make some more such
blisters vpon him, as vpon his nose, his head, his
thighes, and his legges: which <hi>Mannowry</hi> hauing
done, it succeeded according to his desire, for
which he was very iocund and merry with <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowry,</hi>
and sayde vnto him, that the euacuation
which his physicke had caused, had so opened
his stomacke, that he was exceeding hungry, and
prayed <hi>Mannowry</hi> that hee would goe and buy
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:15854:28"/>
him some meat secretly; for, quoth he, if I eate
publiquely, it will bee seene that I am not sicke;
so according to his request, <hi>Mannowry</hi> went to
the <hi>White-hart</hi> in <hi>Salisbury,</hi> and bought him a
legge of Mutton and three loaues, which he ate
in secret, and by this subtilty it was thought that
he liued three dayes without eating, but not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
drinke: Thus hee continued vntill Friday
the last of <hi>Iuly,</hi> seeming alwayes to be sicke in the
presence of company, and neuerthelesse, beeing
alone, hee writte his Declaration or Apology,
and prayed <hi>Mannowry</hi> to transcribe it, which was
since presented to his Maiestie.</p>
                        <p>The same euening Sir <hi>Lewis Stuckley</hi> discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
vpon his sickenesse, and whence it should
proceed, Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> saide in these words,
<hi>As God saue mee, I thinke I haue taken poyson
where I lay the night before I came to this Towne;
I know that Master</hi> Parham <hi>is a great louer of the
King of Spaine, and a Papist, and that hee keepes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
a Priest in his house; but I will not haue any of
you to speake of it, nor you Mounsier</hi> (quoth hee)
speaking to <hi>Mannowry.</hi> Also Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh,</hi>
his Chamber doores beeing shutte, walked vp
and downe, and only <hi>Mannowry</hi> with him, there
naked in his shirt, and tooke a looking glasse,
and looking vpon the spots in his face, whereat
he tooke great pleasure, and laughing, said vnto
<hi>Mannowry</hi> these words, <hi>We shall laugh well one day,
for hauing thus cozened and beguiled the King, his
Councell, and the Physitians, and the Spaniards and all.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="53" facs="tcp:15854:28"/>Vpon the Saturday that his Maiestie arriued
at Salisbury, which was the first of August,
Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> desired to speake with <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowry</hi>
in secret, and seemed to haue a verie
great apprehension of some thing, and hauing
made him shut the doores, prayed him to giue
him a redde leather coffer, which was within
another coffer, which when hee had, hee was
a good while looking in it, and then called <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowry,</hi>
and putting nine peeces of Spanish mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
of gold into his hand, hee saide thus; <hi>There
is twenty Crownes in Pistolets, which I giue you for
your Physicall receipts, and the victuall you bought
mee; and I will giue you fiftie pound a yeere, if
you will doe that which I shall tell you, and if
it happen that Sir</hi> Lewis Stucley <hi>doe aske you
what conference you had with mee, tell him that
you comfort mee in mine aduersity, and that I
make you no other answere then thus, as is here
written,</hi> which hee had alreadie written with
his owne hand in a little peece of paper for <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowries</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>And now Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> beganne to
practise with <hi>Mannowrie,</hi> and to tell him that
hee would flie and get himselfe out of England,
and that if <hi>Mannowry</hi> would aide him in his
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:15854:29"/>
escape, it was all in his power: and that Sir
<hi>Lewis Stucley</hi> trusted in no bodie but <hi>Mannowry;</hi>
whereupon <hi>Mannowry</hi> made him an ouerture,
that at his comming to London he should keepe
himselfe close in a friends house of <hi>Mannowries</hi>
in Shire-lane in London, whereunto he seemed
to encline, and found <hi>Mannowries</hi> aduise good
for a while; but in the end hee told him, that
hee was resolued otherwise, and that hee had
alreadie sent Captaine <hi>King</hi> to hire him a Barke
below Grauelend, which would goe with all
windes, and another little boate to carrie him to
it; <hi>For,</hi> quoth hee, <hi>to hide my selfe in</hi> Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
<hi>I should be alwayes in feare to be discouered by
the generall searchers that are there; but to escape,
I must get leaue to goe to my house, and being there,
I will handle the matter so, that I will escape out of
the hands of Sir</hi> Lewis Stucley <hi>by a backe-doore,
and get mee into the boate; for no bodie will
doubt that I can goe on foote, seeing mee so
feeble, as I seeme to bee.</hi> And then <hi>Raleigh</hi>
hauing mused a while, without speaking. <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowrie</hi>
asked him, <hi>Sir, wherefore will you flie?
your Apologie, and your last Declaration, doe
not they iustifie you sufficiently?</hi> Then all in
choler, <hi>Raleigh</hi> answered him in English thus;
<hi>Neuer tell mee more; a man that feares is neuer se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure;</hi>
which fashion of his put <hi>Mannowry</hi> to si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
for that time.</p>
                        <p>Now there rested nothing but his Maiesties
Licence, to permit him to goe to his owne
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:15854:29"/>
house, without which (hee sayde) hee could
nor possibly escape. This Licence was after gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him by the meanes of Master Vice-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlaine,
and Master Secretarie <hi>Naunton;</hi> which
being obtained, <hi>Mannowry</hi> tooke occasion to
say to him, <hi>That heereby one might see, that his
Maiesty had no meaning to take his life, seeing that
hee suffered him to goe to his owne house to recouer
his health. No (quoth</hi> Raleigh) <hi>they vsed all
these kindes of flatteries, to the Duke of</hi> Byron,
<hi>to draw him fairely to the prison, and then they cut
off his head; I knowe that they haue concluded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them, that it is expedient that a man should
die, to reassure the Trafficke which I haue broken in</hi>
Spaine. And thereupon brake foorth into most
hatefull, and Trayterous wordes against the
Kings owne Person, ending in a menace and
brauery, <hi>That if hee could saue himselfe for that
time, hee would plot such plots, as should make the
King thinke himselfe happy to send for him againe,
and render him his estate with aduantage; yea and
force the King of</hi> Spaine, <hi>to write into</hi> England
<hi>in his fauour.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Mannowry</hi> at that time did aske him fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
if hee escaped, what should become of
Sir <hi>Lewis Stucley?</hi> and whether hee should bee
put to death for him or not, and whether hee
should loose his Office and Estate? <hi>Not to
death (quoth</hi> Raleigh) <hi>but hee will bee impriso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
for a while, but his landes the King cannot
haue, for that they are already assured to his eldest
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:15854:30"/>
sonne; and for the rest, it was no part of his care.
Mannowry</hi> further asked him, if it were not
Treason in himselfe to be ayding to his escape;
<hi>No</hi> (quoth hee) <hi>for that you are a stranger; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse,
you must not bee knowne of any thing,
for then you will bee sure to bee put in prison.</hi> In
conclusion, <hi>Mannowry</hi> demaunded of him yet
further, <hi>But what if it be discouered, that I had any
hand in your escape? why</hi> (quoth hee) <hi>follow mee
into</hi> France, <hi>(that is your Countrey) and quit all,
and I will make you amends for all.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>After, <hi>Raleigh</hi> went on his iourney to <hi>Ando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier,</hi>
and so to <hi>Hartford-bridge,</hi> and from thence
to <hi>Staines,</hi> during which time, Sir <hi>Lewis Stucley</hi>
being made acquainted by <hi>Mannowry</hi> with <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh</hi>
his purpose to escape, vsed extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
diligence in guards and watches vpon him;
which <hi>Raleigh</hi> perceiuing, saide to <hi>Mannowry</hi>
at <hi>Staines;</hi> I perceiue well, it is not possible for
mee to escape by our two meanes alone, <hi>Stucley</hi>
is so watchfull, and sets such strait guard vpon mee,
and will bee too hard for vs, for all our cunnings;
therefore there is no way but to make him of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell;
and if wee can perswade him, to let mee saue
my selfe, I wil giue him in hand two hundred pounds
sterling worth: and thereupon drew forth a Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell,
and shewed it to <hi>Mannowrie,</hi> and gaue it
into his hand, made in the fashion of haile pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
with Diamonds, with a Rubie in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest,
which hee valued at a hundred and fiftie
pound sterling, and said, <hi>Besides this Iewell, hee
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:15854:30"/>
shall haue fiftie pound in money; I pray you goe tell
him so from me, and perswade him to it, I know he will
trust you.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Mannowrie</hi> went presently to <hi>Stucley,</hi> and told
him as before, and concluded with him, that
<hi>Mannowrie</hi> should report backe to <hi>Raleigh,</hi> that
hee would accept of his offer, and bade him
tell <hi>Raleigh</hi> also, that hee was content to doe as
hee desired; but hee would chuse rather to goe
away with him, then to tarie behind with shame
and reproach; and hee bade <hi>Mannowrie</hi> aske
him further, how hee thought hee could doe
this, without loosing his Office of Vice-Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall,
which cost him sixe hundred pounds,
and how they should liue afterwards; and to
what place they should go, and what meanes he
would carie with him, to furnish this inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
escape; which <hi>Mannowrie</hi> did, and was
answered by the said <hi>Raleigh,</hi> and prayed to
tell <hi>Stucley,</hi> that if hee would sweare vnto
him, not to discouer him, hee would tell him
his whole intent; and that for the first point,
though <hi>Stucley</hi> should loose his Office, yet
hee should bee no looser vpon the matter; and
for afterwards, assoone as hee was gotten into
<hi>France,</hi> or <hi>Holland,</hi> his wife was to send him a
thousand pounds Sterling, and that hee caried
with him onely a thousand Crownes in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
and Iewells to serue for the present in his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape.
But after supper, <hi>Raleigh</hi> said vnto <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowrie,</hi>
Oh, if I could escape without <hi>Stucley,</hi>
                           <pb n="58" facs="tcp:15854:31"/>
I should doe brauely; <hi>But it is no matter</hi> (said
hee) <hi>Ile carie him along, and afterwards Ile dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch
my selfe of him well enough.</hi> And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<hi>Mannowrie</hi> relating all that had passed, to
<hi>Stucley,</hi> brought them together, at which time
<hi>Raleigh</hi> shewed the Iewell to <hi>Stucley;</hi> and hee
making shew to bee content, prayed him a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
respite to dispose of his Office; whereupon
<hi>Mannowrie</hi> seeing them so accorded vpon the
matter in appearance, tooke his leaue of them
to goe to <hi>London;</hi> and in the morning <hi>Mannow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi>
vpon the taking of his leaue, said to <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh,
that hee did not thinke to see him againe
while hee was in</hi> England; Whereupon <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh</hi>
gaue him a Letter directed to Mistris
<hi>Herrys</hi> of <hi>Radford,</hi> that shee should deliuer him
an yron fornace with a Distillatory of Copper
belonging vnto it, and charged him to tell eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man hee mett, that hee was sicke, and that
hee left him in an extreme loosenesse that very
night.</p>
                        <p>BVt <hi>Raleigh</hi> hauing formerly dispat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
a messenger to <hi>London,</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
him a Barque for his escape,
came at last to <hi>London,</hi> and hauing wonne
his purpose, (by these former deuices of
feigned sickenesse) to bee spared from
imprisonment in the Tower, and to bee
permitted to remaine at his owne house,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:15854:31"/>
till his better recouery; there fell out
an accident, which gaue him great hopes
and encouragement speedily to facilitate
his intended designe for escape. For as he
came on his way to <hi>London, in his Inne at
Brentford,</hi> there came vnto him a French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
named <hi>La Chesnay,</hi> a follower of <hi>Le
Clere,</hi> last Agent here for his Maiesties dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
brother the French King; who tolde
him that the French Agent was very desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to speake with him as soone as might
be after his arriuall at <hi>London,</hi> for matters
greatly concerning the sayd Sir <hi>Walters</hi>
weale and safetie; as in effect it fell out,
that the very next night after his arriuall at
<hi>London,</hi> the said <hi>Le Clere,</hi> and <hi>La Chesnay</hi>
came vnto him to his house, and there did
the said <hi>Le Clere</hi> offer vnto him a French
Barque, which hee had prepared for him
to escape in, and <hi>withall his Letters recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendatory
for his safe conduct and reception to
the Gouernour of</hi> Calis, <hi>and to send a Gentleman
expresly that should attend and meete him there;</hi>
to which offer of his, <hi>Raleigh</hi> after some
questions passed, <hi>finding the French Barke
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:15854:32"/>
not to bee so ready, nor so fit as that himselfe had
formerly prouided,</hi> gaue him thanks, and told
him that he would make vse of his owne
Barke, <hi>but for his Letters, and the rest of his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
he should be beholding to him, because his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
in</hi> France <hi>was worne out.</hi> So passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onately
bent was hee vpon his escape, as
that hee did not forbeare to trust his life,
and to communicate a secret importing
him so neere, vpon his <hi>first acquaintance, and
vnto a stranger,</hi> whom he hath since con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
<hi>that he neuer saw before.</hi> And thus af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
two nights stay, the third night hee
made an actuall attempt to escape, and was
in Boate towards his Shippe, but was by
<hi>Stucley</hi> arrested, brought backe, and deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
into the custodie of the Lieutenant of
the Tower.</p>
                        <p>For these his great and hainous offences,
in actes of Hostilitie vpon his Maiesties
confederates, depredations, and abuses, as
well of his Commission, as of his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
Subiects vnder his charge, Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures,
Attempts of escape, declining his
Maiesties Iustice, and the rest, euidently
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:15854:32"/>
prooued or confessed by himselfe; he had
made himselfe vtterly vnwoorthy of his
Maiesties further mercy: And because he
could not by Law bee iudicially called in
question, for that his former attainder of
Treason is the highest and last worke of
the Law (whereby hee was <hi>Ciuiliter mortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us)</hi>
his Maiestie was inforced (except At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainders
should become priuiledges for all
subsequent offences) to resolue to haue
him executed vpon his former Attainder.</p>
                        <p>HIs Maiesties iust and honourable
proceedings being thus made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
to all his good Subiects by
this preceding Declaration, not founded
vpon coniectures or likelyhoods; but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
vpon confession of the partie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
or vpon the examination of diuers
vnsuspected witnesses, he leaues it to the
world to iudge, how he could either haue
satisfied his owne Iustice, (his honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
intentions hauing bene so peruerted
and abused by the sayd Sir <hi>W. Raleigh)</hi> or yet
make the vprightnesse of the same his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:15854:33"/>
appeare to his dearest Brother the
King of <hi>Spaine;</hi> if he had not by a Legal pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
of the Offender, giuen an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
aswell of terrour to all his other Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects,
not to abuse his gracious meanings,
in taking contrary courses for the attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to their owne vnlawfull endes; as
also of Demonstration to all other for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigne
Princes and States, whereby they
might rest assured of his Maiesties honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
proceeding with them, when any the
like case shall occurre: By which meanes
his Maiestie may the more assuredly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
and claime an honourable concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
and a reciprocall correspondence
from them, vpon any the like occasion.
But as to Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> his confession
at his Death, what he confessed or denied
touching any the points of this declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
his Maiestie leaues him and his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
therein to God, as was said in the
beginning of this Discourse. For Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
Princes cannot make a true iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
vpon the bare speeches or asseuera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of a delinquent at the time of his
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:15854:33"/>
death, but their iudgement must be foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
vpon examinations, reexaminations,
and confrontments, and such like reall
proofes, as all this former discourse is made
vp and built vpon; all the materiall and
most important of the said examinations
being taken vnder the hands of the exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates
that could write, and that in the
presence of no fewer then sixe of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties

their alike seuerall subscriptions vnder
