         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

The Vrine being red or high coloured with the Hypoſtaſie or light and equall reſidence ſignifieth the Maladie to bee longer then the precedent where there is no Hypoſtaſie, but leſſe dangerous. Alſo when there is groſſe Reſolutions as bran or duſt in the bottome of the Vrine, it is an euill ſigne, and worſe where they are like ſcales of fiſhe. The Vrine white and ſubtile is exceeding bad, albeit the forementioned is worſe where there is groſſe reſolutions. The cloude hanging in the V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine ſignifieth ſecuritie if it be white, for the black is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous:

moreouer the Vrine being yellow and very cleare and ſubtill in the Maladie ſheweth continuitie of ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, groſſe in digeſtion and crudity. Therefore it is to be feared leaſt the ſick perſon decay before the humors come to perfect concoction, and leaſt the Patient die. The Vrine ſignificatiue of certaine death &amp; vnfallible is vnſauourie, ſlimy and muddy, as dirt and myre, and is tauny, browne, black, and thick. Furthermore the blacke as well in man as woman is alwaies bad, and the ſubtle and the cleare as water is alſo mortall in little children. The Vrine being raw, cleare and vndigeſted, perſeuering ſo long in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladie without other euill ſignes, but with good and health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, ſheweth a future Apoſtume lower then the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragme or ribbes: The Vrine hauing as it were a cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>web ſwimming aboue ſignifieth that the perſon ſhall die, Dry and etick ſheweth conſumption of the body: you muſt alſo conſider the place and colour of the cloude, for if it be neere the bottome of the Vrine it is a good ſigne hauing the colour neere vnto white. And if it be ſwimming aboue and on the top and blacke, it is dangerous and vncertaine. Finally as for the Iudgement of Vrines, take heed aboue all that you be not deceiued by the Bladder: For they may appeare ſuch by the diſeaſes of it: And if the Bladder bee not diſeaſed, thy iudgement ſhalbe certaine, therefore take heed.</p>

Thou ſhalt alſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage if there be Apoſtume on the one ſide or both by this meanes: aſke the Patient if he feele dolour on the one ſide more then the other, then cauſe him to lie on the ſide which is ſound, and if he feele heauineſſe and ponderoſitie, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that the ſame ſide where the ponderoſitie is, is A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtumed, and there is the collection and matter: and if he feele dolour, heate, and heauines on both, it will follow, that both ſides are Apoſtumed: Thou ſhalt knowe the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtume and collection to be ripe and broken, and the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter retayned in the part Apoſtumed, when the feuer doth not ceaſe, and it is leſſe by day then night, and that the Patient ſweates aboundantly, and ceaſeth not to cough, and voides not almoſt any thing: likewiſe if his eyes ſinke in his head, and cheekes are red, the nailes crookes, &amp; the ends and extremities of the fingers turne, and the appetite

And if the Feuer be mortall, all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill ſignes giue notice of death in the 4. day or before the firſt period and day of iudgement or cretication, and the ende or tearme of the Feuer is (as we haue ſaid) in the 4. day: the ſecond on the ſeuenth: the ſixt on the 20 day, the which nomber doth augment by quaternaries and is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the 20. day in the Feuer and hotte maladies, and they ought to be nombred by whole quaternaries. For the yeere and moneth cannot be counted by nomber of whole &amp; complete dayes, as by this computation, wee make three weekes of 20. dayes, which is called one moneth or yeere of the Moone. So after this computation and augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, the firſt ſhall be the 20. day, the ſecond the 40. day, the third the 60. day, and it is to bee noted, that the cronile maladies are of long continuance, and of more difficill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature, knowledge and prognoſtication. Therefore it muſt be looked vnto more exactly. For their beginninges are ſecret and ſhewe no ſigne of digeſtion. If therefore you will diligently contemplate it you ſhalbe able to prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſticate to what ende the Feuer ſhall come. Likewiſe the quartan Feuer obſerueth the foreſaid matter in his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tications and iudicatures or weekes of Iudgement. For that which is done in others by nomber of dayes, in this is
<pb facs="tcp:10183:149" rendition="simple:additions"/>
done by nomber of ſittes and periods. The ſhort &amp; briefe maladies are of more eaſie preſagement and knowledge. For it chaungeth preſently, &amp; in the firſt dayes from good to better, or from badde to worſe. The healthfull ſignes are knowne by this, that the patient hath good eaſie breath and feeles no dolour, and ſleepes in the night, and other holſome ſignes. The mortall or dangerous are knowne, when the patient hath difficultie of breath &amp; great dolour, and reſteth not in the night, with other badde ſignes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by one may prognoſticate death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> To the ende thou mayeſt preſage well, thou ſhalt conſider all the ſignes of digeſtion, the time, houres and dayes in which the ſicke are moſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted. And if the Maladie happen to women in childbirth, or ſoone after they be deliuered, beginne to reckon from the day of her deliuerie, and not from the day wherein the feuer began. Alſo to ſpeake generally, when one feeles vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment dolour in the head continue with any Feuer. If there happen any euill ſigne with the foreſaide, it is a ſigne of death. But if the dolour and feuer continue and perſeuer to the 20. day, thou mayeſt preſage fluxe of bloud at the noſe or apoſtumes in the inferiour partes of the body if there be no other ſigne. Sometime alſo there happeneth in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning &amp; firſt daies fluxe of bloud at the noſe or apoſtumes principally when the dolor is in the forehead &amp; parts neere adioyning. And it is to be noted, that the ſaid fluxe of bloud happeneth moſt often to perſons of 30 or 35. yeers of age. And apoſtumes or collections to thoſe which are elder. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo if the patient in the continuall feuer hath great dolour and apoſtumes in the eare, it is a dangerous ſigne. For of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten times the perſon looſeth his vnderſtanding and dyeth. Therefore one ought well to ſpeculate the good and euill ſignes in the beginning of the maladie: for young perſons ſicke of this maladie, doe often die in ſeuen dayes: But olde perſons die not ſo ſoone. For the Feuer cannot bee ſo hotte in them, nor the alienation of the ſpirit ſo vehement. Therefore the Apoſtume commeth to maturation, ſuppu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration

And the yong die before that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtume of the eare come to maturation, except that which commeth forth be white &amp; digeſted with other good ſignes, then they recouer their health.

                     <head>The Concluſion of the whole Booke.</head>
                     <p>NOwe then for finall concluſion let the Mediciner, Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgion and Phiſitian labour to know the ſicke per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and maladies: alſo the good and holeſome, the euil and mortall accidentes of them, as well in young folks as old, and in all infirmities, eſpecially feuers, to the ende to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage life to one and death to another: alſo the breuitie and prolixitie of euery maladie and the tranſmutations and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inconueniences, collecting &amp; accumulating all ſignes good and bad, and conſidering &amp; comparing the ſuperiour and inferiour, which are able to ouerthrowe or ſaue the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, and that by vrine, fecall matter, ſpittle, ſweate and other excrements &amp; ſuperfluities comming out of the body. Moreouer let him practiſe to conſider &amp; ſpeculate or note as well the time of dayes preſent as paſt, viz. the variation of weather by winds, colde, heate, drought and humiditie, and the condition of the whole yeere and foure partes: as the Spring, Sommer, Harueſt &amp; Winter. For although that all maladies may happen at all times, yet ſome doe more commonly happen at one time then another. And ſome ſignes that be good or badde, come and happen ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in one day houre or moment rather then another. And to the ende thou mayeſt not doubt to preſage and prognoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate according to the doctrine and preſcribed inſtructions, know that we haue here experimented theſe thinges in <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopia, Mauritania, Lybia,</hi> in the Ile of <hi>Delos,</hi> in <hi>Heſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> and <hi>Scythia,</hi> briefely in the orient, occident, ſouth and north: and haue founde it true as wee haue ſhowne.

happen any malladies to thee, whereof thou mayeſt doubt, or cannot haue the knowledge of: and that by the ſaide in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, if thou doeſt vnderſtand them well, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in theſe which obſerue dayes of affliction and maner of paroxiſme, and which ende in one certaine nomber of dayes and certaine ſpace as we haue ſaid, if thou wilt ſpeculate exactly, and take mature deliberation.</p>
