            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat which in the Primitive Age of the Church
raised many Enemies to the Christian Faith,
and induced the Potentates of the Earth to
endeavour its extirpation, was a groundless
Suspition of its inconsistency with Civil Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers:
a Calumny invented, no doubt, and spread abroad
by the Devil and his Agents, on purpose to alienate the
minds of men from making profession of it, and to bring
it into the contempt and hatred of Kings and Princes; they
being thereby perswaded that the Kingdom of Christ
(howsoever it was taught not to <hi>consist of this world</hi>) was<note place="margin">Ioh. 18. 36.</note>
an encroachment upon their Dominions; that the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Gospel (howsoever it was said to <hi>be the Gospel</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 6. 15.</note>
               <hi>of Peace</hi>) carried nothing else with it but Fire and Sword,
wheresoever it was planted, that Faction and Sedition,
Conspiracies and Rebellion were the only product of its.
Doctrine; and that they who Taught and embraced it,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:51923:3"/>
were no better then common Incendiaries, Subverters of
the public Peace and quietness, Seducers of the People<note place="margin">Acts 24. 5.</note>
where they came, and even <hi>turned the world upside down.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 17. 6.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But the vanity and the falshood of this Suggestion,
both by the Practice of Christ, and of the Writings of his
Apostles, doth sufficiently appear: For our Saviour did
not only give Commandment to his Followers to <hi>render</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 22. 21.</note>
               <hi>unto Caesar the things which be Caesar's,</hi> as well <hi>as unto God</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mar. 12. 17, &amp;c.</note>
               <hi>the things which be God's;</hi> but, that he might confirm his
Doctrine by his own Example, he patiently submitted<note place="margin">Luke 20. 25.</note>
himself to the Jurisdiction of an Heathen Governour,<note place="margin">Iohn 17. 11.</note>
freely owning the Power and Authority he had over
him.</p>
            <p>Nor were his Disciples less careful to imprint the same
Doctrine in the minds of their Proselytes, strictly charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them as to live in unity and concord one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
so more particularly to be obedient to Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Governours, and to pay a just deference to
the Civil Magistrat. St. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorteth <hi>every soul to be
subject to the higher Powers,</hi> and to <hi>pay tribute to whom tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 13. 1, 7.</note>
               <hi>custom to whom custom, fear to whom fear, honour to
whom honour</hi> is due. And he chargeth <hi>Titus</hi> to <hi>put</hi> the<note place="margin">Tit. 3. 1.</note>
People <hi>in mind of being subject to Principalities and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and to obey Magistrates.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which Subject is also prosecuted by St. <hi>Peter</hi> in this
Chapter of my Text, where he exhorteth his own<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 1, 2, 13, 14.</note>
Countrymen the <hi>Iews</hi> that were dispersed here and there
throughout <hi>Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia,</hi> and <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynia,</hi>
to <hi>submit themselves to every ordinance of man, for
the Lord's sake, whether it be to the King as Supreme, or
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51923:3"/>
unto Governours as unto them that are sent by him.</hi> And
he had some special Reason for so doing; for there was
then, as there is now, a Generation of men, that under
a pretence of Christian Liberty, thought themselves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
no obligation to temporal Princes, denying to pay
them even civil Respect, esteeming all men as equal,
and vainly imagining that no mortal man ought to be
accounted a Prince or a Lord over them. It was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
but necessary for our Apostle to put these men in
mind of their Duty, and to require them <hi>so to be free as</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 16, 17.</note>
               <hi>not to use their Liberty for a cloak of maliciousness, but as
the servants of God,</hi> and <hi>to fear God,</hi> yet so as <hi>to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
the King</hi> also.</p>
            <p>And it is very considerable, that the Persons to whom
he directs this Epistle, were at that time under the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Government of the Emperour <hi>Claudius,</hi> a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane<note place="margin">Suet. in vita <hi>Claudii</hi> cap. 34.</note>
Infidel, and a cruel Tyrant; a worshipper of the
Heathen Idols, according to the custom of the ancient
<hi>Romans,</hi> a Man naturally merciless and given to bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,
and yet such an unbelieving and bloudy Oppressor
this blessed Apostle doth exhort the believing <hi>Iews</hi> to
honour. Now if such deference was to be paid to him,
how much more reasonably is it due to a Christian King?
And with what alacrity should we be ready to yield it to
our present Sovereign, who hath not only shewn him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
merciful already to a great degree, in Pardoning the
Lives of some of those Men whose hands were unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
lift up to take away his; but by his Sacred Word,
(which was wont to be more unalterable then any of
the Laws of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians</hi>) and by his repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51923:4"/>
promises, (which he hath made unconstrain'd, unaskt,
unsought for; God Almighty bless his Royal heart for
it) hath given us sufficient assuranccs that he will sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
and defend our Church?</p>
            <p>It is one great excellency of our Holy Faith that as it
is very consistent with order and civil Society, and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for the prosperity and Happiness of men of all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
So the just Rights and Priviledges of temporal
Princes cannot be better secured then by the rules of its
Doctrine, all persons by the Christian Religion being
enjoyned obedience to those in Authority <hi>not only for
wrath but also for Conscience sake;</hi> every man as he is<note place="margin">Rom. 13. 5.</note>
bound to <hi>fear God</hi> being also obliged to <hi>honour the King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And we cannot but admire and adore the Wisdom
and goodness of God, that when, for the preservation
of Order and Government in the World, he did ordain
that Power and Authority by which Kings do reign and
Princes decree justice, he did at the sametime determine
to provide for the support of it; and took great care for
the securing of their Persons from violence and their
Crowns from contempt, as by many good Laws and
precepts, so more especially by that of <hi>Honouring the
King:</hi> a Duty upon which many others do mainly
depend; a duty incumbent upon all the Kings Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
in what parts of his Dominions soever they live,
by whatsoever Titles they are distinguished, whether they
be Noble or Ignoble, whether they be Lay-men or Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
Persons; a Duty which if rightly practised
would tend to the universal good and welfare of the
whole Kingdom, and of every member of it, 'twould
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:51923:4"/>
make the King great at Home and considerable Abroad,
that we may therefore rightly understand it, that we
may all duely practise it, and carefully avoid what is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
by it, I shall by Gods assistance in my following
discourse endeavour to do these two things.</p>
            <p>1. To explain the Duty, and the several parts of it, And
<hi>2dly.</hi> To shew the Obligations we have to it.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>First,</hi> for explanation of the Duty; by Honouring
the King may in short be meant, an awful framing and
composing of the whole man respectively to his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
For it hath respect to the very cogitations of out
hearts to which none but God and our selves are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scious;
it concerns our speech, and puts a bridle upon
our tongues; it hath an eye upon our actions, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects
the regulation of them. But that we may more
fully discern what it doth positively require, what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
it doth plainly forbid, be pleas'd to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of these following particulars.</p>
            <p>1. Honouring the King doth require a Reverential
esteem of him, an inward respectiveness of the soul to
him, so as in our thoughts to have a worthy opinion of
him, and to think of him very highly according to the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of his Office, and the eminent Character he bears a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
us. Such (no doubt) was that honourable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
which the Subjects of King <hi>David</hi> had of him,
when they own'd him to be worth <hi>ten thousand of them,</hi>
as you may find in the Second Book of <hi>Samuel</hi> the <hi>18th.</hi>
Chapter and the <hi>3d.</hi> verse: as likewise when in the same
Book of <hi>Samuel</hi> the <hi>21st.</hi> chapter and the <hi>17th.</hi> verse,
they held him to be the <hi>Light of Israel.</hi> Such were the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51923:5"/>
thoughts which men conceived of <hi>Zedekiah</hi> (who yet
was no very good King) when, upon his fatal Captivity
under the <hi>King of Babylon,</hi> he was lamented by the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of <hi>the breath of their nostrils.</hi> Such every lawful<note place="margin">Lament. 4. 20.</note>
Governour that sits upon the Throne of Majesty ought
to be esteem'd, such apprehensions should every one of
us have of our King.</p>
            <p>We must have so great thoughts of his high Calling as
to look upon him to be Gods immediate Vicegerent
within his own Dominions, and to be accountable to
him only for what he doth; for <hi>where the word of a
King is there is power and who may say unto him what dost</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccles. 8. 3.</note>
               <hi>thou?</hi> we must esteem him under God to be the Supream
Governour, and not imagine that any man or any num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of men either within or without his Realms hath any
power or Superiority over him. In which respect it was
that <hi>Saul</hi> was said by <hi>Samuel</hi> to be the head of the tribes<note place="margin">1 Sam. 15. 17.</note>
of <hi>Israel,</hi> &amp; the King is called <hi>Supream</hi> in this very chapter<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 13.</note>
of my text, and by the good Lawes and Constitutions
of this Land our present Sovereign is declared to be. So
in all Causes and over all persons, to think otherwise of
him is to wrong him, and detracts from that honour
which by the Laws of God &amp; man belongs unto him. Let
the Votaries of the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> who think the <hi>Pope</hi>
to be above him, and the upstart Sect of <hi>Presbyterians</hi> or
Independents that would have him truckle under the
Cognizance of their <hi>Classical meetings.</hi> See how at the
last great day they will answer to God their denyal of
this part of his just prerogative. The Loyalty of the
Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of <hi>England</hi> teacheth us another Doctrine, we
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:51923:5"/>
all being thereby obliged to believe that the King hath
all Power both Ecclesiastical and temporal; and so long
as we are members of this Church, we must do him that
right and afford him that honour in our hearts, as to be
firmly perswaded that no humane Authority is above his,
or equal to it, that none may constrain or limit it.</p>
            <p>And as we are not to lessen his Sovereignty in our
thoughts, so neither should we think ill of him, much
less devise or contrive any evil against him. Honour is
properly an inward act of the Soul, which if it be true
and sincere cannot afford harbour for any base intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
or treacherous designs. evil purposes and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litious
imaginations can no more consist with it then
Light with Darkness, or love with hatred; and for a
man to profess that he honours the King and at the same
time to entertain thoughts and designes of harm against<note place="margin">2 Sam: 3. 27.</note>
his Crown and Dignity, is like <hi>Ioab</hi> to speak fairly and
friendly to his Neighbour, and presently to smite him<note place="margin">2 Sam; 20. 10.</note>
under the fifth rib to the very heart. The imaginations
of our hearts ('tis true) are only known to God; But, if
they be void of that due regard we should have for our
Sovereign, if they give way to any bloody intendments
and Teasonable Practices, although no mortal man that
is not made privy to them can make them known, yet
that all-searching eye that pierceth into the very secrets
of the heart can, and often doth discover them (be they
never so cunningly &amp; closely contrived) by wayes &amp; me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
sufficiently declaring his care and providence in the
protection and preservation of his Vicegerent. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:51923:6"/>
the persons of Princes are more Sacred then the
persons of private men, therefore God hath promised
in his holy word that <hi>curses tho' but in the heart con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccles: 10. 20.</note>
               <hi>against them</hi> shall be detected by the <hi>Birds of
the Air,</hi> that is, in some Notorious and Remarkable
manner if by ordinary means they cannot be revealed.
So detestable in the sight of God are but the least
intentions of evil against the <hi>Lords anointed.</hi> And may
all those Devilish devices be confounded, and those
false and evil thoughts blasted, that shall at any time
be hatched in the breast of any man against the Life or
against the Honour of our Lord the King.</p>
            <p>Now when this Reverential Esteem and Awful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
for the King is once well setled and grounded in
the heart, it will soon exert it self in real and substantial
matter in outward and visible Signes that may plainly
testifie and manifest our inward respect. Honour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in the thoughts will not rest wholly there, but
will be productive of apparent indications of it; 'tis
the <hi>root</hi> that gives life and nourishment to the <hi>branches</hi>
that sprout up from it; the Original and Spring from
whence several considerable Duties, as so many rivul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets
from the Fountain-head, do naturally flow, 'tis not
sufficient to pretend an inward respectiveness, without
giving an outward and sensible evidence thereof, for
that would be but vile mockery; as on the other hand
an outward submissiveness without an inward, hearty
and sincere reverence would be but downright hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erisy:
Wherefore,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:51923:6"/>
(<hi>2dly.</hi>) Honouring the King doth require that
we should speak Honourably of him, feldome making
mention of his name but in such a manner as may Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of respect and best express the esteem and awful
regard which we do bear or ought to bear towards
him; upon good occasions giving him his due Titles,
and such appellations as either the word of God or the
Lawes of the Land, or the Custome of the Age we
live in, do allow and approve of. Such was that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon<note place="margin">1 Sam. 24. 8. 26. 19. 29. 8.</note>
phrase which we so often meet with in the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament
<hi>my Lord the King.</hi> Such is that style which
the Acts of Parliament do commonly make use of,<note place="margin">2 Sam: 9. 11 13, 33 14. 15, 17 18, 28.</note>
               <hi>the Kings most Excellent Majesty.</hi> Such are those ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
epethites which our Liturgy hath given him,<note place="margin">Ier. 38. 9.</note>
               <hi>Our gracious Sovereign, Our Dread Sovereign, Our
most gracious King and Governour.</hi> Such expressions<note place="margin">Esther. 1. 4.</note>
as these carry with them a Specimen of respect, and
do well denote the sense we have of his high Calling
and Authority over us.</p>
            <p>Our words oftentimes are good indications of our
mind, and whosoever he be for whom we have a real
honour, we cannot but sometimes by our very speech
make a discovery of it. but to let the tongue fly out
in evil Language and bitter expressions against him
are no way consisting with it, What shall we then think
of those railing <hi>Rabshakey's</hi> and cursing <hi>Shimei's</hi> (If
there be any such now living) that make it their busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to traduce the Sacred Majesty of their Sovereign
not only with Sawcy, impudent, reproachful, and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:51923:7"/>
scandalous but false names? What shall we say of
those two Arch-Traytors the late <hi>Duke of Monmouth,</hi>
and the late <hi>Earl of Argile,</hi> that in their Traiterous
Declarations had the brazen Confidence to call His
present Majesty a <hi>Tyrant</hi> and <hi>Vsurper?</hi> Words that
our very Souls should abhor to think of; but they had
the Fate they deserv'd, and may all such revilers of
Authority fare no better!</p>
            <p>We cannot but consider, and should seriously lay it
to our hearts, how that St. <hi>Paul,</hi> having call'd <hi>Ananias</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 23. 5.</note>
a whited Wall, no sooner was told that he was the
high Priest but he retracted his word and acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his errour, saying, <hi>I wist not brethren that he was
the high Priest, for it is written, thou shalt not speak evil
of the ruler of thy people.</hi> And St. <hi>Iude,</hi> amongst great<note place="margin">Iude 8.</note>
Sins reckons up a despising of Dominion, and speaking
evil of Dignities. Should we be admitted into the
King's Presence, and had we the honour to speak to
Him face to face, doubtless our behaviour would be
profoundly reverent, and our words accordingly.
And is it then proper or becoming us to give our
tongues the liberty of speaking any ways contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
of him, or with less respect unto him behind his
back? Wherefore, O all ye that pretend to honour
the King, let it be your care that it may be known by
your words that you really do so.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3dly.</hi> Honouring the King doth require that we
should actually do such things as may contribute
to his honour, promote the grandure of his State, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:51923:7"/>
be a Means of his making a good Figure both in his
own Dominions and amongst his neighbouring Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
For the persons whom we heartily honour, we
cannot but endeavour to advance in their credit and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
in the world, and do all we can that may be
for their well-being, and make them great and happy.
Now those things that may obtain that blessed end I
conceive to be these. <hi>First,</hi> supplying of his Wants;
<hi>Secondly,</hi> assisting him against all his Enemies; and
<hi>Thirdly,</hi> praying unto God for him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Supplying of his Wants, whether it be by
paying of him his just Tribute and Custom, or by
raising a fresh Contribution for Him, as his present oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
shall require: Then the doing of which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
seems to be more reasonable; for how other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
shall he be enabled to provide for the Public, and
to maintain his People in Peace and Safety? It is he
that acts for the Public Good and Happiness of all his
Subjects, and it cannot surely be deem'd unreasonable
that he should be supply'd out of the publick Stock:
They that deny him that Justice, do as much as in them
lyeth to open a gap for any Intruder to dispossess him
of his Throne, and to work the Ruine of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms.
The fulness of the King's Treasures is next un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
God the Strength and Sinew, the main Support
and Bulwark of the Land; and if we suffer that to be
very low and remain in an ebbing condition, we then
deprive him of all Capacity of doing us good, expose
our selves to divers unavoidable Calamities. So that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:51923:8"/>
keep Him bare and Poor is in effect to be injurious to
our own selves, to cut off our ovvn hands, and disenable
us from helping and relieving our selves upon any emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
Occasion.</p>
            <p>We do usually account it unnatural for a son to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
his Father, in his Necessity, seasonable Relief and
Comfort: how much more reasonably should it be
so esteemed to withhold Supply from the <hi>King,</hi> who
is <hi>Pater Patriae,</hi> the common Father of his Country,
upon whose Happiness and Prosperity so much public
Good doth mainly depend?</p>
            <p>Besides, without such supply he cannot keep up the
Port and Dignity, the State and Majesty of a King,
so as to live with Credit, or in any tollerable Splendor
befitting the Quality and Office whereunto God hath
called him, which must necessarily expose him to
the Ignominy and Contempt of other Crown'd Heads,
who upon that account may make nothing of Deriding
and Despising him, and even Trampling him under
their Feet.</p>
            <p>Our Saviour Christ thought the payment of Custom<note place="margin">Mat. 17. 27.</note>
to be so very right and equitable, that he wrought a
Miracle to pay Tribute-money, and hath command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<note place="margin">Mat. 22. 21.</note>
us (as in the beginning of this Discourse I took notice
of) to give unto <hi>Caesar the things that be Caesar's;</hi> and<note place="margin">Mark 12. 17.</note>
the supplying of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Wants is as much <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Due<note place="margin">Luke 20. 25.</note>
as any thing whereof we have a rightful Possession may
properly be called our own.</p>
            <p>To conclude therefore this point, if we love the
King, as we are bound to do; if we value his honour
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:51923:8"/>
which should be dear unto us; if we have any regard
to our own temporal happiness which is much bound
up in his and cannot well be separated from it. Let us
then not be backward or unwilling to afford him such a
pecuniary supply as his important affairs may demand
or the great Council of the Nation may at any time
think fit to tax us with.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Assisting him against all his Enemies is
another means whereby we may promote the Kings
Honour, which if they ever prevail against him must
consequently be much impaired and eclipsed. The
Kings enemies are ours, and we should be as active
and vigorous in helping him to overcome them as if
their Swords were directy level'd at our own hearts.</p>
            <p>Now the Kings Enemies are either Forreign or
Domestick; his Forreign Enemies are the Inhabitants
of other Nations, with whom he may at any time
be obliged for his own honour or his Kingdoms good
to wage War; against whom we are bound to fight,
and ventured our Lives and Persons in his just defence,
which should be as much at his Command and Service
as our Estates and Fortunes.</p>
            <p>His Domestick Enemies of the two are the worse;
for a man can have no worse Adversaries then those<note place="margin">Mat. 12. 25.</note>
of his own Houshold. <hi>a Kingdom divided against it</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mar. 3. 24.</note>
               <hi>self cannot stand; and if an house be divided against it
self</hi> (unless the good hand of Providence intervene)<note place="margin">Luk. 11. 17.</note>
               <hi>the ruine of that house must needs be near.</hi> Now his
Majesties Domestick Enemies are those of his Natural
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:51923:9"/>
Subjects, that being instigated by the Devil, do
bear an ill will to his Person, and carry on evil
Designs, and evil Practices against his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Of which some (perhaps) may be in open Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,
and with a bare face commit Acts of Hostility
against him. And a Man would really wonder that
there should ever be such Monsters in Nature, such
unnatural bruit Beasts as thirst after the Bloud of
their own Father, endeavour to rip up the Womb
of their own Mother, and seek the subversion of the
Place of their own Nativity; the which all they
may be suppos'd to do that draw their Swords against
their Liege Lord and Sovereign, and by a civil War
disturb the public Peace. And it is but the last Years
Revolution that makes us experimentally know that
there may be Devils upon Earth in humane shape,
as well as there are really Devils in Hell, and as
these rebel against God, so do they rebel against
Gods Vicegerent. Now when Rebels are got to
such an Head, as to appear in open Arms, it is the
part of good Subjects to shew themselves for the
Kings side, by resisting and opposing them, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting
their Numbers to encrease, by cutting them
short of Relief, by Declaring openly against them,
by animating each other to withstand them, all of
them in their several Capacities contributing some way
or other to quell and subdue them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:51923:9"/>
Again, others there are of the King's Domestick
Enemies that appear not so openly, but yet covertly
manage the same mischievous and treasonable Designs.
And they are by so much the more formidable &amp; dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
by howmuch the more unperceivable and unsus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
their ways and methods of Proceeding are: such
are they who will not professedly declare and level
War against him, but they will lay cunning Plots and
privy Conspiracies to deprive him of his Life. Others
will profess an abhorrence of such a bloody Enterprize,
and declare that they have no ill will towards His Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
but yet they will not stick at seizing of his Guards,
taking Him out of the hands (as they think) of evil
Counsellers, and keeping Him under a Restraint till
he shall be forced to comply with their unreasonable
Demands, or they will endeavour (as was the Saying,
and the Design of that ungrateful Traytor the late <hi>Earl
of Shaftsbury</hi>)<note place="margin">Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the late Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his late Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's Order, <hi>Pag.</hi> 9.</note> 
               <hi>leisurely to walk His Majesty out of His
Dominions,</hi> by setting up factious Clubs, and Cabals of
disaffected and discontented People; by subtile and
crafty Insinuations, withdrawing the Vulgar from the
Duty of their Allegiance, infecting their Minds with
seditious Principles, and making them sit for any sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Assault and Insurrection: which things they do,
some for some particular disgrace, which they deserved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
received at Court, seeking to revenge their private
Quarrel, by setting the whole Nation on a Flame; some
out of Pride and Ambition, not thinking themselves
sufficiently rewarded for their former Services; some
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:51923:10"/>
out of a vain affectation of Popularity, desiring to be
esteem'd the Head of a Party; some out of a design to
fish in troubled Waters, and to become gainers by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic
Destractions; and lastly some for the meer sake of
doing Mischief, like the Scottish <hi>Ferguson,</hi> that remorse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Villain, that, when the accursed Treasons of his
Confederates were hapily detected, had notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the boldness to profess that<note place="margin">Decla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ration of the late Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy. <hi>Pag.</hi> 69.</note> 
               <hi>for his part he would
never be out of a Plot as long ashe liv'd.</hi> Now when
such men are busied upon such hellish Contrivances, it is
the Duty of all those that truly Honour the King, to be
assisting to him in counterplotting their Designs, in
suppressing their Meetings, in making (if possible)
a discovery of their Actions, and bringing their Persons
to condign Punishment.</p>
            <p>Particularly it should be the Endeavour of all inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or
Magistrats and subordinate Officers, who are to be
<hi>a terrour to evil Works,</hi> to take care that the King suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers<note place="margin">Rom. 13. 3.</note>
no wrong by such Workers of evil; that none of
His just Rights and Prerogatives be invaded and viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by them; to keep the Populacy <hi>quiet,</hi> and make
them <hi>do their own Business;</hi> to suppress seditious Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults
in time, lest by connivance and forbearance they<note place="margin">1 Thess. 4. 11.</note>
become too headstrong and unruly; and by a vigilant
Circumspection, to look well to the Trust which their
great Master hath reposed in them.</p>
            <p>Nay, it concerns all the loyal Party, when the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
grows insolent and daring, it mainly (I say)
concerns us all to be no less couragious and active ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:51923:10"/>
to our power, in asserting the King's Cause, and
vindicating his honour, and not to suffer it to be run
down by Noise and Clamour, and by Fury and Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence:
in such a Case to sit still and be afraid to own
Him, is to betray him, and quietly permit him to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a Prey to those that hate him: we should speak
our Minds freely and act boldly in the Defence of him,
and chuse rather to be buried in the Ruines of the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Family (if that must fall) then part with our Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty,
and side with their Enemies. But,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As we may be very instrumental in promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the King's honour by relieving his Wants, and by
assisting him against all his Enemies, so likewise may
we be so in praying unto God for him: which, as it is
a Duty enjoyn'd us by St. <hi>Paul, exhorting us to pray as
for all Men,</hi> so more particularly for <hi>Kings,</hi> so it is in its<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2 1. 2.</note>
self most easie and in every Mans power to perform.
For whereas all men have not wherewithal to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
towards the relief of the King's wants, all men may
nevertheless pray for Him. The poorest man in his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions
can make him this Offering, and the richest can
afford him nothing better. He that begs his bread from
door to door, and is himself destitute of present Suste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
may enrich his Prince by the Tribute of his Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and advance him higher then all the Kings of the
Earth. And again, whereas all the King's Subjects are
not, nor indeed conveniently can be actually engaged
in his Service by fighting for him, and assisting him
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:51923:11"/>
against his Enemies, yet they may all pierce Heaven
by their Prayers, and derive down showers of bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
upon his Armies, and make them Successful
and Victorious.</p>
            <p>Now those things which we should chiefly beg of
God for him are, that he may be endowed <hi>First,</hi>
With all Spiritual blessings with the Piety of <hi>David,</hi>
with the Wisdom of <hi>Solomon,</hi> and with a daily supply
and encrease of all other gifts and graces that may be
needful for him; <hi>2dly.</hi> With all temporal blessings
that he may be delivered from all dangers incident to
his place from Private Conspiracies, from Tumultuous
Factions, and from Open Rebellion; that he may
overcome and subdue all his Enemies, that they may
have no advantage over him nor the Wicked approach
to hurt him; that his Life may be long and his Reign
happy, and that all his Subjects may <hi>lead a quiet and
peaceable life in all Godliness and honesty.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>Such were the Petitions which the Primitive Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
put up to God for the Heathen Emperours, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for their very Persecutors, <hi>vitam prolixam, impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium</hi>

and so on as <hi>Tertullian</hi> tells us; the example therefore
binds much more when a King hath submitted his Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to the standard of Jesus, and maketh profession of
the Christian faith.</p>
            <p>Nor indeed can we reasonably expect that the King
should be happy and prosperous, without our sincere
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:51923:11"/>
observance of this Duty; for let us do what we can to
make him so, tho' we cheerfully assist him with our For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
and our Lives (as we are bound to do when need
so requires) yet if we do not add our Prayers to the
King of Kings to crown him with his favour and loving
kindness, in vain may all our endeavours be, for <hi>there
is no King that can be saved by the multitude of an hoast,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal: 33. 16.</note>

in vain.</hi> But if all the Kings Subjects would but most
affectionately Pray for him, and with one heart &amp; one
mind humbly beg the blessing of God upon him, we
might then have great hopes that the joynt-addresses of
a whole Nation, would be very prevalent at the Court
of the King of Heaven. Wherefore that men do not truly
Honour the King, that is negligent in this Duty of
Praying for him, forasmuch as he neglects that one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient
that may so much tend to his true Interest and
true honour. But further,</p>
            <p>(<hi>4thly.</hi>) As Honouring the King doth require that
we should do such things as may tend to his honour,
so it doth likewise oblige us to do nothing that may
lessen it, and to endeavour to prevent and suppress
whatever may be prejudicial unto it. For it is
natural for us to abhor and avoid as much as
we can whatever may tend to the discredit of those
whom we really Love and Honour; nor can that
honour which we ought to have for the King consist
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:51923:12"/>
with any thing that may defame him, or cast a ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
upon his Govenment; and those things that may
have this malevalent effectare, <hi>First</hi> Scurrilous Libels,
<hi>Secondly,</hi> Scandalous Reports; and <hi>Thirdly,</hi> the bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zoing
abroad his personal errours and failings.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Scurrilous Libels, whether they be in writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or in Print, in Prose or in Verse do not only make
the King ridiculous but contemptible too; they have
a direct tendency to the wronging of his Person, to
the lessening of his Authority, to the weakning of his
Power, and in conclusion to the very shakening of
his Throne; and that man that can find in his heart
to wound the Kings Honour by making Libels upon
him, would not stick upon a convenient occasion to
embrue his hands in his bloud he that keeps them is
as bad for he thereby approves of what the other hath
done; else why doth he keep them? why doth he
treasure them up and is so chary of them? is it for the
wit and Elegancy of speech he meets with in them?
but what wit can there be in Ribaldry invectives and
Scurrilous reflections upon the Lords Anointed? is not
that wit vilely misemploy'd and that ingenuity dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated
into folly that is spent upon such unworthy
Designs? What loyal heart can endure to see his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign
vilely abus'd and bespatter'd in the most witty,
and most elegant Language? Could a man be well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to have himself, or his dearest Friend so serv'd? and
can we then with patience and contentedness, with
pleasure and delight, behold the Sacred Majesty of our
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:51923:12"/>
King (which one would think should be exempted from
such Usages) Satyrically exposed and libelled? much
less shall we give entertainment and harbour to such
Scurrilities, and not rather with indignation and abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
reject and tear them?</p>
            <p>But then he that gives vent unto them, and makes
them public, spreads the malignity of them, and is not
perhaps well aware what great Injury as well as what
great Indignity he thereby doth the King; but if he be
aware of it, if he knows the harm and considers the
Mischief that may from thence arise, and yet forbears
not to hand them from one to another, he is a Traitor
to the King, a betrayer of His Honour, and an enemy
to his Kingdoms. In a word, they that make them,
they that keep them, they that disperse them are all
Blameable. If we do indeed heartily honour the King,
if we have any value for the preservation of His Credit
and Renown, as we should never make such Libels our
selves, so having found them, being made we should
presently seek to suppress them, and make them quite
away. So likewise should we do in reference</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> To scandalous Reports, whether they be
true or false; if true we should forthwith stifle them in
their very first birth, keep them wholly to our selves,
and prevent the farther growth of them; if false, we
should contradict them, rectifie the Mistakes, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
the Cheat and Malice of them, and not only so
but do all we can to keep them from spreading; for if
scandalous Reports do but once take air, how senseless
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:51923:13"/>
and unreasonable soever the grounds for them may be,
yet they will not only find entertainment with credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
and easie People, but also be apt to encrease in
the telling; such I make account are those that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
bad News, misrepresentation of the Kings actions
traducing of his good ones, missinterpretation of his
words, odious reflections on the Government, the
raising of Fears and jealousies, and the like. All which,
or any of them, may by degrees lessen the King in the
esteem and regard, the Love and affections of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
may make them weary of his Government, and
breed in them an aversion and hatred to his Person;
such Reports are of very pernicious consequence, and
may have a malignant influence upon the honour and
the happiness of the King and his Kingdoms. And
therefore as it should be the great concern of us all to
beware of them, so more particularly is it the Duty
of all Masters of Families to take care that neither
their Children nor Servants nor any under their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
be the broachers or the publishers of such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
let them not suffer them to have the liberty of
talking of State Affairs, or censuring the Actions of
their Superiours, or making any reflections upon them,
or shewing their islike of them, or setting themselves
up for Politicians and reformers of what their idle
fancy may think amiss; and let no man amuse him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
or others with fears and jealousies of ills to come, we
know not when nor how, to perplex our selves with
such thoughts and to vent them abroad, is not only to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:51923:13"/>
wrong the King's Justice, the King's Wisdom, and the
King's Goodness, but to distrust the Providence of God
too.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The blazoning abroad the King's personal
Errours and Failings, may also be very prejudicial to his
honour, and make some of his weak Subjects conceive
an ill Opinion of him. It is I suppose, a Saying in the
common Law, that the King can do no wrong, that is,
no wrong which any humane Law or Judicature can
call him to an account for. But as he is a Man, and
subject to the like Frailties with our selves, He may
have several deviations from the Law of God, to whom
only he is responsible for them. There is no man upon
Earth that liveth and hath not some Failings, and is not
guilty of some Miscarriages and Sins, and happy is he
that hath the fewest and the least to answer for; and
we cannot expect that the King, who is subject to
greater Temptations then other men should be wholly
without. But then for us to pass our Censure upon
them and make them the subject of our daily Discourse
is not only the height of rudeness and unmanner liness,
but a great Affront to his Sacred Person, and directly
tends to his public Defamation. We should rather en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to conceal them and not talk of them at all;
or if we do, it should only be to extenuate and lessen
them, and as far as we can make good excuses for
them. That Christian Charity which obligeth us not<note place="margin">Mat. 7. 1</note>
to judge our Brother will much less suffer us to do so of<note place="margin">Luk. 6. 37</note>
our King. What Man would be pleas'd to have his<note place="margin">Rom. 14. 10, 13.</note>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:51923:14"/>
own Failings, or the Failings of his own Father pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
expos'd, and made the common talk of the
Country? And is it fitting that we should deal less
respectively with the Father of it? The King's Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
ought to be as dear unto us as our own, or any of
our nearest and dearest Relations and Friends; and if
we have a true honour for him, we must not, nay we
cannot do any thing that may ruine it, that may but
lessen or shake it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>5thly.</hi> Honouring the King doth require, that we
should submit our selves to him, and obey all his just
and lawful Commands, readily and cheerfully without
murmuring, without regret, without repining at, or
complaining of them. We should behave our selves
towards him like the Soldiers of the <hi>Centurion in the
Gospel, to any of whom if he said go, he went, or to another
come and he came; or to another do this, and he did it.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 8. 9.</note>
Without this Submission &amp; Obedience, we shall but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly
fulfil the Duty of my Text: For to pretend
to honour the King, and at the same time to disre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
his lawful Commands is in effect a manifest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
of his Authority, a great affront to his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
Power, and a plain violation of that dutiful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
that is due unto him. Honour is that which an
Inferior ought to pay to a Superior, nor can he better
evidence the reality and sincerity of it, then by his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to what shall lawfully and justly be imposed
upon him. Whence it is that those whom we hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
honour we are ever ready to obey, cheerfully atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:51923:14"/>
upon the Execution of their will and pleasure, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing
thereby to testifie the deference and regard we
have for them: Nor can we do less towards the King's
Majesty, if indeed we sincerely and unfeignedly do
honour him. Nay, we have somewhat a greater Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
to be obedient to Him then to any other Man;
for all the King's Laws and Commands, so far forth
as they are not contrary to the Laws and Commands
of God, do bear the Stamp of a divine Sanction; and
those things that in their own Nature are purely indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
do then cease to be so when by him they are
enjoyn'd or forbidden; And he being God's Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentative
upon Earth, they do upon that account ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
and demand our just compliance with them. If in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
his Laws should plainly interfere with the Laws
of God, if he commands any thing that is manifestly
contrary to the will of God revealed in his Word, if
what he enjoyns be in it self directly sinful, we must
then say with the blessed Apostles of our Lord, <hi>that it
is better to obey God then Men.</hi> But we that live under<note place="margin">Acts 4. 19. 5, 29</note>
the happy Government of these Nations, and in the
Reign of so just a Prince, need not trouble our thoughts
with such Supposals: however neither upon such an
account, nor upon any other pretence whatsoever
should we use any violence towards him, or make any
resistance against him: but we are by Scripture, by
Reason, and the consent of Antiquity strictly obliged
either actually to perform his Will, or patiently suffer
his will to be done upon us. This is the Doctrine of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:51923:15"/>
the Catholick Church, This the Doctrine of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Church of <hi>England,</hi> this the opinion of all Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox
Loyal and good men, This was the profession
and Practice of the Primitive Christians.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>6thly.</hi> And lastly, Honouring the King doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
that we should at some certain time and in some
solemn manner celebrate the memory of any notable
atchievement performed by him, of whatsoever deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
out of Eminent dangers, or happy success in
great undertakings, or extraordinary blessing upon
his Person and Government hath through Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
befallen him, or us through him; and that we
should endeavour the best way we can to testifie the
joyfulness of our hearts and our sincere thankfulness
to God Almighty for the same. The doing of which
as it is a very good and laudable Custom (received in
all Countries, practised throughout all Ages) so it is
a direct Honouring of him; we thereby giving some
demonstration that we love and respect him, that
his Happiness and his Life are of great Concern to us.
Solemn times of Festivals and Public Thanksgivings
for the Divine favours and Benedictions confer'd upon
our Sovereign do well express the sense we have of
them and are a good Sign that we highly value and
Esteem them: and for a man upon such occasions to
give no indication of joy, no testimony of gratitude
to God for them looks as if he were discontented at
the Kings Prosperity, or not well pleas'd with it or
could heartily have wish'd it had been otherwise.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:51923:15"/>
And if any Nation under Heaven ever had a just
cause of such Solemnities, certainly we of this have not
the least. For if we call to mind what mercies and
deliverances God was graciously pleas'd to vouchsafe
our King both before and since his coming to the
Crown; how after a long and tedious Banishment
from his native Country, he was again with his late
Royal Brother brought back in Peace; how mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culously
he escaped the danger of Shipwrack in the
<hi>Glocester</hi> Frigate; how Providentially he was deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
from the Barbarous assassination intended at the
<hi>Rye,</hi> And Lastly, how wonderfully Successful his
Arms were in the Suppression of the late Rebels both in
<hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland;</hi> when (I say) we reflect upon
these things, we cannot but discern and adore the
good hand of God that out of such Perils both by
Sea and Land, hath reserved Him at last to Sway
the Scepters of these Kingdoms, and prospered
the beginning of his Reign with a Victory so Remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable
and so much conducing to the good of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.
But particularly should we affectionately upon
this Day Commemorate his quiet and peaceable Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
to the Throne of his Ancestors. For when
were consider how maliciously the Minds of ill men
were not long since set against him; what endeavours
we made use of to exclude him from his just Rights,
(Him the next Heir to the Imperial Crown of this
Realm, Him the intirely beloved Brother, the only
Brother of that most merciful Prince King <hi>Charles</hi> the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:51923:16"/>
Second, Him the Son of that Royal Martyr King
<hi>Charles</hi> the First, Him that had often hazarded his
Royal Life in the defence of this Nation, and by his
Courage and Conduct had gain'd Credit and Glory
to it,) and farther what Rumors and Stories to that
end were made of Him; what bandyings and Consultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
were held to work his Ruine and Subvertion, and
thereby to involve the whole Land in a Miserable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
and Sea of bloud; and yet that, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all this, all those restless endeavours of unreasonable
men should be quite frustrated and brought to nought,
that the Strivings of the People should so soon be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
into a joyful reception of him, and that he
should so quietly and so peaceably enter upon the
Entire Possession of his just Birthright and full Power,
without Bloudshed, without Tumults, without any
Opposition, with the joyfull Triumphs and Acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of all good men, and receive no disturbance till
the Late Unnatural Risings; when (I say) we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
all this, how great reason have we to Rejoyce
Unfeignedly, and most heartily to give the most Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful
God all Thanks and Praise who so wonderfully
and so happily brought to pass the quiet Settlement
of his Anointed, and thereby delivered him and us
from those Direful effects that must necessarily have
been the sad Consequents of that <hi>black Bill</hi> of
<hi>EXCLVSION.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor can it be any diminution of the honour or any
reflection upon the memory of Our Late most Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb facs="tcp:51923:16"/>
Sovereign to make the Day on which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased
a day of Joy and Thansgiving. For we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but at the same time gratefully commemorate the
many blessings we enjoy'd during the Reign of that
most excellent Prince; and in the midst of our Holy
Triumphs for the happy Succession of the next Heir,
we cannot but affectionately remember that it was He
next under God who by his Vigilant care and Prudent
management of affairs, allayed the heats and madness
of the People, stem'd the current of Popular fury,
brought the face of things to so good an issue, and
made the entrance to the Throne so plain and so easie
for his Lawful Successor.</p>
            <p>It was God's great mercy to us that he Lived so
long to do so great things, that he Died a quiet and a
natural Death, and after all the Storms and Tempests
he strugled with, left his Kingdoms in so serene a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, whilst we endeavour to express our
Joy and our Thankfulness to God for the King's quiet
and peaceable Succession, let us not forget him who
through God's blessing was the great cause and instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of it. So shall we honour the King that now is,
and not wrong the Memory of the King that is dead.</p>
            <p>And I beseech you my Friends, give me leave to
exhort you to celebrate the Feast of this Day thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:51923:17"/>
cheerfully, and soberly; not in Rioting and
Drunkenness, not in Licentiousness and Disorder, lest
whilst you pretend to observe it in honour of the King,
you should by your Intemperance dishonour God.</p>
            <p>Having thus at large explain'd the Duty of <hi>Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the King,</hi> and shewn you the chief Parts whereof
it doth consist, I shall in the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2d.</hi> Second place, but very briefly touch upon
the Obligations we have to this Duty, and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1st.</hi> The first of which may be taken from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of the Authority, by which he Reigns, and
that is no less then Divine; <hi>for by me</hi> (saith God)
<hi>Kings Reign and Princes decree Iustice, by me Princes</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 8. 15, 16.</note>
               <hi>rule, and Nobles, even all the Iudges of the earth.</hi>
He derives not his Power from the People, (for they
are but his Natural Subjects) nor from the Solemnity
of his Coronation, (for that is but a Ceremony of
State) nor from inherent or infused Grace, (for the
most graceless <hi>Heathens</hi> have been invested with Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Dominion,) but from the Constitution and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment
of God, <hi>for there is no power</hi> (St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells
us) <hi>but of God, the powers that be are ordained of God.</hi>
Whence it is that all Kings and Supreme Rulers are
called in Scripture the Lord's Anointed. And parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
<hi>Cyrus</hi> the <hi>Persian</hi> Monarch by Profession a
meer Heathen is in <hi>Isaiah</hi> said by God himself to be<note place="margin">Isa. 45. 1</note>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:51923:17"/>
his Anointed; and all civil Magistrates, those especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
that have the Supreme Jurisdiction are also
upon this accouut said to be Gods, of whom God
himself saith, <hi>I have said ye are Gods:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 12. 16.</note> and that
very fitly and properly, for they only act in his
name by his Power, upon his account; and as God
is the only Supream Governour over all the World,
so are these under him in their respective Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 8. 5.</note>
and so there may be as St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Gods
many and Lords many.</hi> Usurpers that by Violence
and Rebellion step into the Throne of Majesty, such
as was the Late Protector, falsly so called, have not
this Prerogative, nor is their power from God; of
such it is that God speaketh, in the <hi>8th.</hi> of <hi>Hosea</hi>
and the <hi>4th.</hi> verse <hi>they have set up Kings, but not by
me, they have made them Princes, and I knew it not.</hi>
But all Lawful Governours that come in by right and
Lawful means (such as beyond all condradiction is
Our present Sovereign) have their Character from
the God of Gods and derive their Authority from a
Divine Sanction.</p>
            <p>Wherefore looking upon the King not barely as
a Man, but as a man by Gods appointment Reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
over us, we cannot but find our selves oblig'd
to Honour him. Forasmuch as by honouring him
we Honour the Ordinance of God; and by not
Honouring Him, neither do we Honour the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of God. We should Honour him for the
<hi>Lords Sake,</hi> who hath alwayes esteem'd any affront<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 13.</note>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:51923:18"/>
or disrespect done to His Anointed as if it had been
directly offer'd to himself. And if there be some
degree of Honour due to the Kings Ambassadours
abroad as they are his Representatives, and to all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior
Magistrates at Home as they act by his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
and are sent by him, how much greater Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
doth there then belong to the King himself, who
is the Publick Minister of God and his immediate
Vicegerent?</p>
            <p>2. Another Obligation to this Duty may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from the Advantages that accrue to us through
his Government; for he is set over us for our good,
and makes it his business to take care of us and protect
us. And therefore to do him honour is but a just Retri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution
for the Benefits we receive by him.</p>
            <p>3. To which, thirdly and lastly, we are obliged
from the Principles of our Holy Catholick Religion,
as it is derived throughout all Ages from Christ himself,
and as it now stands planted and reform'd in the
Church of <hi>England.</hi> Which Church as it teacheth us
all true Faith towards God, so it obligeth us to all
true Loyalty to the King. Nor can we any longer
be good Members of this Church, nor consequently
good Christians, then whilst we remain firmly Loyal.
The <hi>King</hi> hath often Declared himself well satisfied
with the Principles of our Church, as they are for Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy
and Loyalty, and if we would not have our
actions contradict our Principles, if we would have
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:51923:18"/>
them still preserved in that good Opinion he hath of
them, we must honour him in all those particulars
which I have mention'd to belong to this Duty;
which whosoever doth not conscientiously observe
cannot be a truly Loyal Man, nor doth he well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
to be accounted (as by being Members of this
Church we all justly profess our selves to be) a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the Catholick Church.</p>
            <p>My Friends and Gentlemen, I am very sensible
that I have detained you very long; But the Subject
I have handled is Great and Noble, Copious and Seaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
nor could I have in any tollerable degree dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
my Duty had I said less of it, tho' I could say
much more. But I will make no Apology for the
tediousness of this Discourse, well knowing that a
Congregation that Loves and Honours the King,
(such as I believe this to be) cannot be displeased
tho' it may be tired with Exhortations to Loyalty:
Nor shall I detain you any longer, then till I have
Concluded with that short but comprehensive <hi>Form
of Blessing the KING,</hi> or wishing well unto Him,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 16. 16.</note>
which was so frequently made use of in Times of Old,<note place="margin">2 King. 11. 12.</note>
which is so suitable to the Day and my Text, and
wherein I doubt not but I shall have your hearty Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent;<note place="margin">2 Chr. 23. 11.</note>
