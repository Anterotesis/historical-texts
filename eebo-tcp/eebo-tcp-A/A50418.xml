            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>My Honoured Lord,</salute>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hose learned Jews and Christians,
who have been curious to find out
the reason of some Visions in the
Scripture, do affirme, That the
Bush which <hi>Moses</hi> saw unburnt
in the midst of fire, was an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleme
of the <hi>Israelites</hi> then in
bondage to the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> who were not onely preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in the midst of Persecutions, but thrived under
their Oppressions, hard Tasks and heavy Burthens;
and grew more numerous from the politick Arts which
strived to lessen and destroy them: till at length God
contrived them a miraculous Deliverance, which with
their Calamitios concluded in a Song.</p>
            <p>When I look back upon our late suffering Times,
(the saddest which I think any History hath recorded)
where Oppression backt with Power made the Ruine of
<pb facs="tcp:60020:3"/>
our Church the horrid step and ladder to the Usurpation
of the Crown; and where the name of a Bishop was so
criminal and odious, as to verifie <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s sad com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
of his brutish Times, <hi>Nominis &amp; vocabuli
rei fuimus,</hi> We were made guilty of a Word, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
for being Christians, and the style was punisht
with publick Sales and Sequestrations: and when with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
I do consider, by what unlookt-for way of Providence
your Order and Religion, like a Treasure snatcht from
shipwreck, were stupendiously restored after many years
Confusion: Methinks that Bush which <hi>Moses</hi> saw
was the Embleme of our Church, kept safe by Miracle
in the midst of hungry fire: and the Ship in the Gospel
was presented to my eyes, where Christ and his Apostles
were tost in an hideous Storm; but he waked and stilled
the Winds, and put a calmness to the Sea.</p>
            <p>In these dayes of publick Calamity, I was curious to
observe how several men behaved themselves in strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
with their dangers. I saw some take for their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern
the Prophet <hi>Jonas</hi> in a storm, who slept securely
and untroubled when his Shipwreck rolled about him.
I saw others so much Cowards, that to preserve their
wretched Fortunes they compounded with the Tempest,
and made a League and Friendship with the Winds;
nay, Servilely revived the Religion of those base timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Heathens, who worshipt every thing they fear'd,
and sacrificed to Furies, and built Altars to their
Plagues. I saw others of a nobler and more stout and
<pb facs="tcp:60020:3"/>
Christian Temper (whose just reward is now to shine
like Stars of Honour in the Church) immovably reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
to maintain their Loyalty and Conscience with the
loss of their Lives, as they had already with their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes.</p>
            <p>Yet, I hope, it will be no diminution of their Vertues,
if I say, That your Lordships Carriage in these Times
of Persecution was to me most remarkable; who by your
happy Restitution, and addition of more Honour, have
been made a greater Bishop, but not a greater Person,
then you were in your lowest ebbe of Fortune.</p>
            <p>The payment of your Vow in your building of an
Alms-house on the place where you your self so ofter sate,
not wanting of an Almes, but weeping o're the Prospect
not then pleasant to your Eye, because your proper busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
there was to aske the passers by, If ever there were
sorrows like to the sorrows of this Nation; Your large
Bounty to the College of which I am a Member, which,
if I should name the Summe, would make the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
you meant to found a new College, and not complete
an old; Your dying Liberalities bequeathed to others in
your Will, even to your meanest Servants, who were your
servants in distress, are things which do proclaim you a
great and noble Benefactor. But these are but the
good deeds of your Fortune, done by the Bishop of <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester,</hi>
the Charities of one possest with plenty and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance;
your Rents and Mannors here share with
you as Co-founders: and your new Almes-house might
<pb facs="tcp:60020:4"/>
have it written on the Walls, <hi>A poor Bishop vow'd
this House, but a great and wealthy built it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That which made you truly great and reverend in
my eyes, was to look into your noble Heart, your large
and bounteous Mind, where your Good Deeds now, were
then but Wishes and Designs. You were truly great to
me, when I saw you in your Poverty anticipate your
Almes-house, and be liberal at your door: and the poor
people in your House now, had then places at your
Gate; when being reduced to the last Cruse of Oyle,
you made the drops run to others; and when there was
but a handful of Meal left in the little Barrel, you then
dealt your Loaf to those who wanted daily bread. In
short, when you had but two Coats left, to give one to the
naked; when you had hardly more then one Dish, to
make the poor your Guests; to see you walk up your Hill
with not much money in your purse, and return back
with none; but then to think of laying up Treasures
in Heaven, when you had so little left on Earth, was a
Charity which raised in me a religious Admiration; and
lookt something like the Miracle wrought by our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
in the Gospel, where Multitudes were fed with two
fishes and five loaves.</p>
            <p>Nor may I, without some Injustice to your Vertues,
forbear to let the world know, That I never saw Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
born with a more serene and even temper then you
did yours; who in the worst of Times stood like a firme
unshaken Rock in the midst of angry waves; your
<pb facs="tcp:60020:4"/>
Courage still the same, unbroken or undisturbed with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
sad Disasters not more publick then your owne.
The old Church of <hi>England</hi> still kept up in your
House, with all its Formes and Rites, though pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
forbidden; Prayers constantly, and twice a
day, read by you for the King, at a time when such
Devotions were made Treason by the Tyrant; and
Weekly Sermons preacht before you, filled with so much
Loyalty and Truth, as would any where else have cast
the Preacher into Bonds, if not sent him from his Pulpit
to the place of Execution.</p>
            <p>To all this your Lordships continued Kindnesses
to me, by which I can compute my self almost grown
aged in your Favours; your encouragement of my youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
Studies, which grew up under your Example;
your Rescue of me from a Shipwreck in the late un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing
Times, when being tost, and stript of all, you
were the Plank to save me, and threw me out a line
which drew me safe to shore; are Reasons sufficient to
let the World know, that of most sins I think Ingratitude
the worst.</p>
            <p>Being therefore fairly invited at first to preach
this Sermon, and since by several Hearers of it to
make it this way publick, I beseech your Lordship to
allow it the shadow of your Wing; and to accept it,
not as a full payment of my Debts to you, (for this
very Dedication of it sets me deeper on your score)
<pb facs="tcp:60020:5"/>
but as a Testimony how much greater my Desires are
then my Abilities or Parts, to let the World know
how unfeignedly I am</p>

Lastly, as when the <hi>materials</hi> are all ready and

that the <hi>Workmen</hi> doe their Duties, and that all
things be done regularly as the <hi>Surveyors</hi> shall

course and method, in the designing, shaping,
forming and building of his <hi>Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon whose rude beginnings if we cast our
eyes, as it first appeared in the times before the
Law, though it began with the World, and be

wrapt up in a Mystery, and many thousand

'twas but then a Church creeping forth out of
the Quarrey, without a hand to give it its just

their Reason to discover and find out.</p>
               <p>So that in the state of Nature the case stood
with Religion, as some have observed it did
with the first Essayes in Painting; unskilful
men at first drew faces with a Coale, to which
after-times found Colours, and gave beauty by
their Pencil. Or, if you will hear me speak in
the language of a Poet, in this imperfect state

He was so rustickly adored, that a Thatcht.
Cottage was his Temple, where he stood hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an <hi>Farthen Thunder</hi> in his hand.</p>
               <p>To redeem himself from so much rudeness
of Devotion, and to contrive a Worship some
way worthy of his Greatness, in the times of
the Law he chose unto himself a select, peculiar
People, which he formed into a Church; and
placed it for some Ages like a City on a Hill, to
invite the erring World to be its Proselytes and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60020:7"/>
Converts. His Service here below was taught
to move like the Heavens above, in a well-tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
harmony and musick of the Spheres. A
<hi>High-priest</hi> was appointed, and the Miter set
upon his head; and inferiour <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi>
had their lower Orbs assigned them. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
were prescribed, and the business of the
Temple proportion'd and cut out to the several
Orders and Degrees of those, who thus distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish'd
were to wait upon the Altar: and the
distinction was so sacred, and the several
bounds so set, that as the <hi>Levite</hi> was not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade
the Office of the <hi>Priest,</hi> so those inferiour
<hi>Priests</hi> who broke beyond their bounds, and
attempted to invade the Office of the <hi>High-priest,</hi>
were not said to offer Sacrifice, but <hi>strange
fire</hi> before the Lord, and perish'd for their
boldness with their <hi>Censers</hi> in their hands: To
let us see, that God was then the God of Order,
and turn'd such mens Oblations into their
ruine and destruction.</p>
               <p>Yet the <hi>Jewish Church</hi> thus modelled by Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God himself, was but the imperfect
draught and platform of a much holier Church
to come. 'Twas but like their Tabernacle,
their House of Offerings and Oblations, a
moveable Pavilion, or Tent fitted for a march
towards a Land of Promise, not yet discovered
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60020:7"/>
to their eye; where that transitory Building,
that Temple made of threds, was to be taken
down to make way for one more lasting. In
short, as 'tis observed, (and 'tis St. <hi>Austins</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation)
That in the forming of the <hi>Jewish
Church</hi> the platform was first drawn, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
in a holy Scheme to <hi>Moses</hi> in the
Mount; so when that Scheme or Platform
was wrought into a Fabrick, when that which
was a Pattern became a bodied Truth, even
that glorious Church, in the midst of all its
splendour, was but a type and shadow of the
<hi>Christian Church</hi> to come. Some of the old lines
were indeed to be preserved, but with the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of new colours drawing nearer to the life;
a <hi>High-priest</hi> was to be retained, but with his
Robes and Miter changed; the <hi>Order of Aaron</hi>
was to pass into the <hi>Order of Melchisedeck;</hi> no
longer to remain the <hi>Priest</hi> of one private, single
People, but to be the publick <hi>Priest</hi> of all the
Nations in the World. The inferiour <hi>Priests</hi>
and <hi>Levites</hi> too were to shift and change their
<hi>Ephods,</hi> and to pass into the Christian <hi>Presbyter</hi>
and <hi>Deacon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now to hold you no longer in the
Porch and Entrance of this Sermon, but to
draw this large Circle to its intended Point
and Centre; to reduce those Shadows into
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60020:8"/>
Substance, and those Platforms into Building;
to form a <hi>new</hi> Church out of the ruines of an
<hi>old,</hi> stupendious in the raising, and eternal in
duration; to make the Scripture-Prophecy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
true authentick Story, and the Glory of
the <hi>second Temple</hi> to eclipse and drown the <hi>first;</hi>
to break down the <hi>Partition-Wall</hi> which divided
<hi>Jews</hi> from <hi>Gentiles;</hi> to square disproportion'd
Subjects, and unite all Nations in one <hi>Faith,</hi> and
by one common <hi>Gospel</hi> to bring them to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
was a Work reserved for none but <hi>Christ</hi>
the Son of God himself. Who, as he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
designed to be the <hi>Head</hi> of this <hi>new Church,</hi>
so, that he might be the <hi>Founder</hi> and <hi>Foundation</hi>
of it, the chief <hi>Corner-stone</hi> and great <hi>Master-builder</hi>
too, all the <hi>Powers</hi> of Heaven did help to
carry on the Work.</p>
               <p>I think I need not tell you, that the <hi>Gospel,</hi>
like the <hi>Law,</hi> was at first proclaimed by the
Ministry of <hi>Angels;</hi> that <hi>Jacobs dream</hi> and <hi>vision</hi>
was made by them true story; a <hi>Ladder</hi> was set
up which reach'd from Earth to Heaven, and
they <hi>ascending and descending</hi> with sacred Messa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
to Men. Nay, the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> himself, who
foretold this in the <hi>old</hi> Testament, was most
busily imployed to fulfill it in the <hi>new:</hi> every
Sermon preach'd was attended with a <hi>miracle;</hi>
and the <hi>Doctrine</hi> signed and ratified with holy
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60020:8"/>
                  <hi>prodigies</hi> and <hi>wonders;</hi> the <hi>Preachers</hi> all inspired
with <hi>gifts</hi> proportion'd to their Work, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
by those <hi>gifts</hi> to go and teach all Nations.
Nay, so sollicitous and careful was this holy <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi>
of God to provide fit <hi>Successors</hi> to those inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and gifted <hi>Teachers,</hi> that for many years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the first plantation of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> not a <hi>Bishop</hi>
was installed or admitted to his <hi>Chair,</hi> not a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor</hi>
to his <hi>Charge,</hi> not a <hi>Deacon</hi> to his <hi>Table,</hi>
which was not first designed, and named, and
qualified by him. And this I might prove to
you by several places of the Scripture, but none
more clear then this which I have chosen for
my Text; where St. <hi>Paul</hi> sayes to one of those
new consecrated Bishops, <hi>Neglect not the Gift that
is in thee, which was given thee by Prophecy, with the
laying on of the Hands of the Presbytery.</hi>

               <p>

procure a good liking and agreement, as one in
whom both <hi>parties</hi> had an equal <hi>Interest</hi> &amp; <hi>claim.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now of all the men designed by God to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish
that great Work, I know none in all
kinds so well fitted and proportion'd as this <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
man,</hi> the <hi>Bishop</hi> in this Text; whose very <hi>birth</hi>
disposed him to break down <hi>Partition-walls,</hi> and
to be a <hi>Reconciler</hi> of both parties from the <hi>womb.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For, if we enquire into his <hi>Original</hi> or <hi>Birth,</hi>
as 'tis set down in the <hi>Church-book, Acts</hi> 16. his
Mother was a <hi>Jewess,</hi> but a <hi>Jewess</hi> made a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian;</hi>
and his Father was a <hi>Greek,</hi> but well-affected
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60020:9"/>
to the <hi>Jews,</hi> as you may read in the first
Verse of that Chapter: not a <hi>Greek Hellenist,</hi> or
<hi>Jew</hi> bred in <hi>Greece,</hi> called so from the <hi>Grecian</hi>
Language which he spoke; nor a <hi>Greek</hi> in the
<hi>Grecian</hi> sense, a man opposed to a <hi>Barbarian:</hi>
but a <hi>Greek</hi> in the general acception of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
which divides the whole World of men
into two Members, <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Greeks.</hi> For, if
we may give credit to the <hi>Syriack Translator,</hi> he
was <hi>Aramaeus,</hi> that is, no <hi>Greek,</hi> but <hi>Syrian:</hi> or
as the <hi>Latine Interpreter</hi> more largely hath descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
him, he was <hi>Homo Gentilis,</hi> that is, no <hi>Jew,</hi>
but <hi>Gentile.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as his <hi>Birth</hi> did thus prepare him to
preach the <hi>Gospel</hi> to all Nations, so St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
who well knew the advantage of this <hi>mixture,</hi>
and how readily a <hi>Jew</hi> would hearken to a <hi>Jew,</hi>
and a <hi>Gentile</hi> be perswaded by one who was a
<hi>Gentile,</hi> to make his Capacity more passable
and currant, thought fit to <hi>circumcise</hi> him,
though he were before a <hi>Christian;</hi> as you may
read at the fourth Verse of that Chapter. That
by imploying one to preach who was a <hi>baptised
Jew,</hi> and one who withall was a <hi>circumcised Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever,</hi>
all prejudices might be stopt, and no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
left to hinder or obstruct the free pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
of his Sermons. For that this was the
reason why he <hi>circumcised</hi> him, namely, not to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60020:10"/>
oblige him to observe and keep the <hi>Law,</hi> but to
remove obstructions from his preaching of the
<hi>Gospel,</hi> is evident from the end and close of that
Verse, which sayes, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> in a holy pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
did it, because <hi>They all knew that his Father
was a Greek.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And certainly, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> by this <hi>action,</hi> this
<hi>politick design,</hi> gained justly to himself the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of that style, which he bestows upon
himself, of being <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>A wise Master-builder,</hi>
in the third Chapter of his first Epistle
to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> at the tenth Verse; one
who knew how to fit his <hi>Tools</hi> to his <hi>Matter,</hi> to
hew rude <hi>Subjects</hi> to his <hi>Ends,</hi> and to give them
<hi>shape</hi> and <hi>form,</hi> so as to work upon the <hi>tempers</hi> of
disagreeing <hi>Minds:</hi> so no passage more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms
that rare Description of his <hi>Art,</hi> which he
makes in the 9. Chapter of that Epistle, at the
20. Verse and forwards, where he sayes, That
he <hi>became all things to all men; as a Jew to the Jews,
and as a Gentile to the Gentiles;</hi> to them <hi>under the
Law</hi> as a man lock'd up in shackles, to them
<hi>without Law</hi> as at perfect liberty and freedom:
And all this to compass his great <hi>Catholick De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,</hi>
which was to bring, if possible, both <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
to salvation.</p>
               <p>Next then, as his <hi>Birth</hi> did much contribute
to his <hi>Function,</hi> so his <hi>Education</hi> contributed
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60020:10"/>
much more. He was bred in a <hi>Family</hi> upon
which <hi>Religion</hi> seem'd entail'd, where <hi>Piety</hi> ran
in a bloud, and lineally descended, like <hi>Vertue</hi>
of Inheritance, from the Parents to the Child.
St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaking of his Mother <hi>Eunice,</hi> and his
Grandmother <hi>Lois,</hi> in the 1. Chapter of his
2. Epistle to him, at the 5. Verse, sayes, <hi>It very
much rejoyced him to find the same unfeigned Faith in
him,</hi> which in a holy Pedegree he received and
took from them.</p>
               <p>And certainly, as <hi>ill Example</hi> hath the power
to convey <hi>hereditary Vices,</hi> to infect by being <hi>seen,</hi>
and to corrupt by <hi>imitation;</hi> nay, as <hi>Vice</hi> in the
<hi>Parent</hi> hath such an influence on the <hi>Child,</hi> as to
think it disobedience where the <hi>Parent</hi> is a <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi>
not to be as wicked and as great a <hi>sinner</hi> too:
(As the young <hi>Virgin</hi> in the <hi>Poet</hi> seeing her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chast,
lascivious <hi>Mother</hi> write <hi>Letters</hi> to her loose
<hi>Adulterer</hi> and <hi>Servant,</hi> thought her self obliged
to think <hi>Chastity</hi> a sin, and so learnt in time to
write such <hi>Letters</hi> too; or as the young <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
whose Father was a <hi>Gamester,</hi> learnt to
handle <hi>Dice,</hi> and stake whole Mannors at a
Throw) So <hi>good Example</hi> hath the like power
to infect by being <hi>seen,</hi> and <hi>Vertues</hi> may like
<hi>Vices</hi> be made <hi>hereditary</hi> too.</p>
               <p>But besides those seeds of <hi>Vertue</hi> sown in him
by his <hi>Parents,</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> himself had been his
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60020:11"/>
                  <hi>Tutor,</hi> and had the forming of his <hi>manners;</hi> he
was bred up in his <hi>School</hi> to that ripeness and
perfection, that he superscribes this <hi>Epistle</hi> to
him as to one <hi>begotten</hi> by him: <hi>To Timothy my
Son,</hi> sayes he; nay, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>To Timothy my
own Son,</hi> sayes our <hi>English Translation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in the <hi>Greek,</hi> if we may
believe St. <hi>Jerome,</hi> is a <hi>word</hi> to which no other
Tongue can find a <hi>word</hi> to match it; a <hi>word</hi>
which in all kinds signifies the <hi>Son</hi> to have such
a near resemblance to the <hi>Father,</hi> as almost to
confirm the Opinion of <hi>Andreas Dudithius,</hi> who,
in his book <hi>De Conjugio Presbyterorum,</hi> maintains
that St. <hi>Paul</hi> was married and had children,
like St. <hi>Peter.</hi> Of which, but that we know
his Father was a <hi>Greek,</hi> the <hi>word</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> might
perswade us that this <hi>Timothy</hi> was one.</p>
               <p>Indeed the resemblance between them was
so great, that as in other <hi>births</hi> and natural <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations</hi>
the marks to distinguish the <hi>true-born</hi>
from the <hi>spurious</hi> are the likeness of the <hi>child</hi> in
shape and visage to the <hi>parent,</hi>
                  <q>Sic oculos, sic ille manus, sic or a ferebat;</q>
If he have his Fathers <hi>eyes</hi> and <hi>cheeks, looks, hands</hi>
and <hi>gestures</hi> too, we may conclude him <hi>genuine,</hi>
and the Parent <hi>twice the same:</hi> So St. <hi>Jerome</hi> in
his close Interpretation of that <hi>word,</hi> proceeds by
a <hi>distinction,</hi> which holds comparatively true;
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60020:11"/>
St. <hi>Paul</hi> had many Sons, sayes he, whom he
converted to the <hi>Faith,</hi> as the <hi>Corinthians</hi> and
<hi>Ephesians,</hi> whom he vouchsafes to call his <hi>Sons:</hi>
But the style of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or <hi>Filius germanus,</hi>
the style of <hi>true-born Son,</hi> so in all things like
<hi>himself,</hi> as not to be more the <hi>Son</hi> of the Parents
that begot him, then he was his <hi>morum filius,</hi> the
<hi>Off-spring</hi> of his Mind, so furnisht with his <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,</hi>
so accomplish'd with his <hi>gifts,</hi> so zealous
in his <hi>preaching,</hi> so valiant in <hi>afflictions,</hi> so active
in his spreading the <hi>Gospel</hi> through the World,
was a style bestowed on none but this <hi>Timothy</hi>
and <hi>Titus:</hi> As if all <hi>others</hi> were his <hi>Bastard-sons,</hi>
begot upon some <hi>Hagar,</hi> and onely these <hi>two</hi>
were <hi>legitimate.</hi> It is St. <hi>Jerome</hi> sayes so.</p>
               <p>In short, as <hi>likeness</hi> in <hi>manners</hi> begets a <hi>dearness</hi>
in <hi>affections,</hi> and as a <hi>friendship</hi> in <hi>affections</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets
a <hi>likeness</hi> in <hi>engagements;</hi> so St. <hi>Paul</hi> made
him his <hi>Fellow-labourer</hi> and <hi>Associate.</hi> When the
<hi>Decrees</hi> of the <hi>Apostles</hi> were to be disperst, made
in their <hi>general Council</hi> assembled at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi>
this <hi>Timothy</hi> was chosen to assist him in his Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels;
as you may read in the 16. Chapter of
the <hi>Acts,</hi> at the 4. Verse. When an <hi>Evangelist</hi>
was to be sent to confirm those <hi>distant Churches,</hi>
which St. <hi>Paul</hi> himself had <hi>planted,</hi> but was not
able to <hi>re-visit,</hi> this <hi>Timothy</hi> was sent as his <hi>Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-Lieutenant;</hi>
as you may read in several <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles</hi>
to those <hi>Churches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:60020:12"/>
To all this, such a holy <hi>prudence</hi> shined forth
in all his actions, his <hi>Morals</hi> were so good and
so seasoned with <hi>Religion,</hi> that his <hi>Name</hi> was
like that <hi>precious Oyntment</hi> in the Scripture, still
breathing forth <hi>perfumes</hi> in all places where he
came: For, <hi>he was well reported of,</hi> he was above
all reproch and scandal; as you may read at
the 3. Verse of that Chapter.</p>
               <p>And of such <hi>Instruments</hi> as this did the Holy
<hi>Ghost</hi> make choice to be <hi>Preachers</hi> of the <hi>Gospel,</hi>
and <hi>Rulers</hi> in the <hi>Church:</hi> Men, whose <hi>Life</hi> as
well as <hi>Doctrine</hi> was still <hi>Sermon</hi> to the People;
men, who confuted <hi>Vice</hi> not more by <hi>argument</hi>
and <hi>reason,</hi> then by their blameless <hi>carriage</hi> and
vertuous <hi>conversation.</hi> 'Twas against the <hi>Oeconomy</hi>
and <hi>Discipline</hi> of Heaven, to send men into Gods
<hi>Vineyard</hi> who went <hi>drunk</hi> into the <hi>Field;</hi> and
who minded not the <hi>vine,</hi> but the <hi>vintage, grape</hi>
and <hi>wine.</hi> And the Holy <hi>Ghost</hi> himself had er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
had he given his <hi>Pearls</hi> to <hi>Swine,</hi> to the <hi>sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual</hi>
or <hi>intemperate,</hi> still wallowing in the <hi>mire:</hi>
or had he taken his <hi>holy things,</hi> and cast them
unto <hi>Dogs;</hi> no sooner eased of <hi>one distemper,</hi> but
returning to <hi>another.</hi> No <hi>cloven Tongues</hi> of fire
did sit upon their <hi>heads,</hi> whose tempers were
still <hi>cloven,</hi> still kindling <hi>Flames</hi> and <hi>Factions,</hi> still
breaking of Gods people into <hi>divisions, rents</hi> and
<hi>schisms.</hi> The <hi>gift</hi> of <hi>Knowledge</hi> was not dropt
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60020:12"/>
upon the <hi>ambitious, proud, high-minded;</hi> their

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or <hi>Gift,</hi>
here in this Text, and comes in the next place
to crave a room in your Attentions.</p>
               <p>The Saying of our Saviour Christ when he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
spoke it was so true,<note place="margin">His Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</note> in the 10. Chapter of
St. <hi>Luke</hi> at the 2. Verse, <hi>The Harvest truly is great,
but the Labourers are few;</hi> that to increase their
<hi>number,</hi> and to fit them for the <hi>work,</hi> the Holy
<hi>Ghost</hi> was fain to interest himself in the choice
of <hi>workmen,</hi> and the <hi>qualifying</hi> of them too: His
work and business 'twas to send men into the
<hi>Field,</hi> and to teach them how to manage and
use their <hi>Sickle</hi> too.</p>
               <p>The Men already chosen, if their number
had been greater, where a <hi>World</hi> was to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
were too disproportion'd for the <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest.</hi>
Besides, they wanted <hi>parts</hi> for so great an
undertaking; unless they could have done like
the man in <hi>Eunapius</hi> a <hi>Greek Historian,</hi> who tells
us of one <hi>Aedesius,</hi> who had so much the Spirit
of <hi>Divination</hi> in his power, that he would but
clap a Wreath of <hi>Lawrel</hi> on his head, and
straight speak by <hi>Inspiration,</hi> straight put himself
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60020:13"/>
in <hi>Raptures,</hi> and utter learned <hi>Oracles,</hi> to the
great amazement of the Hearers.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Apostles</hi> were not all bred at the feet of
<hi>Gamaliel,</hi> but were as yet <hi>unlearned,</hi> men called
from mending <hi>Nets,</hi> fitter to deal with <hi>Fishes,</hi>
and to put forth a <hi>Boat</hi> to Sea, then to cast their
<hi>Nets</hi> on Land, and there catch men in the <hi>Inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</hi>
Besides, being <hi>Jews,</hi> they were hardly fit
to preach to <hi>Jews;</hi> for where was their <hi>gift</hi> of
<hi>Miracles</hi> to work upon the <hi>Jews,</hi> who were onely
to be gained by <hi>Miracles</hi> and <hi>Wonders?</hi> Had they
preacht to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> where was their <hi>gift</hi> of
<hi>Tongues,</hi> to preach to all <hi>Nations,</hi> who could
speak no <hi>Tongues</hi> but one? Had <hi>Christ</hi> sent to
<hi>Athens</hi> to stock himself with <hi>Preachers,</hi> he might
have found great <hi>Scholars</hi> there, but hard to be
perswaded to forsake their own <hi>Schools,</hi> and to
list themselves in <hi>his:</hi> Nay, these for some Ages
were the greatest Enemies of the <hi>Faith;</hi> men
who measured Truth by <hi>Aristotles</hi> Precepts,
and would believe no more then what some
<hi>Plato</hi> taught: Nay, men who, like <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyrius,</hi>
called the Christian Religion <hi>Barbaram
philosophiam,</hi> A barbarous Philosophy; A <hi>new
Doctrine</hi> creeping forth into the World by the
<hi>foolishness of Preaching;</hi> affraid to enter combate
with any <hi>rational</hi> Dispute, or to endure a tryal
where <hi>right Reason</hi> was <hi>opponent.</hi> According to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60020:13"/>
that which St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath delivered in the first
Chapter of his first <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> at
22, 23. Verses, where he sayes, <hi>The Jews require a
sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom.</hi> That is, the
<hi>Jews</hi> would believe no more of the <hi>Gospel</hi> then
they saw confirmed by <hi>miracle,</hi> and proved by
<hi>signs</hi> and <hi>wonders:</hi> And the learned <hi>Greeks</hi> or
<hi>Gentiles</hi> would admit no more then they saw
confirmed by <hi>Syllogisme,</hi> and proved by <hi>Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration.</hi>
In this scarcity of <hi>Preachers</hi> then, to
win upon all parties, and to captivate both <hi>Jews</hi>
and <hi>Gentiles</hi> to the obedience of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> the
<hi>Holy Ghost</hi> pour'd forth his <hi>gifts,</hi> proportion'd to
the <hi>work</hi> which each man was to do, as Time,
Place and Countrey needed: To one was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
the Word of <hi>Wisdom,</hi> to another the Word
of <hi>Knowledge,</hi> to another <hi>Prophecy,</hi> to another
the <hi>gift of Healing,</hi> to another the <hi>gift of Miracles,</hi>
to another the <hi>gift</hi> to discern true Prophets
from the false, to another the <hi>gift of Tongues,</hi> to
another the <hi>gift</hi> to interpret the sense and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of those <hi>Tongues: And all these wrought that
one and self-same Spirit,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, for the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Church; as you may read in the
12. Chapter of the first <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi>
the 11. first Verses.</p>
               <p>Now in the distribution and imparting of
those <hi>gifts,</hi> unless it were our Saviour <hi>Christ</hi> the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60020:14"/>
Son of God himself, in whom this holy <hi>Spirit</hi>
had no limit, bound or measure, he never did
pour forth himself in such overflowing <hi>gifts</hi> as
he did on the <hi>Apostles,</hi> the first <hi>Preachers</hi> of
the <hi>Gospel.</hi> The old <hi>Prophets</hi> had him sparingly,
more sprinkled then poured forth; he was to
them a <hi>little Brook,</hi> to these a <hi>full-tide Sea;</hi> he fell
in <hi>single drops</hi> on them, on these in <hi>full-grown
showres.</hi> Besides, <hi>they</hi> had him but sometimes,
<hi>these</hi> to themselves and <hi>heirs:</hi> they were able,
like a firm Estate, to bequeath him in their
<hi>Wills,</hi> and to make him their <hi>gift</hi> to others, as
he was his <hi>own gift</hi> to them; for whereever they
laid their <hi>Hands</hi> the holy <hi>Ghost</hi> still followed.
The <hi>gift</hi> of <hi>Tongues,</hi> of <hi>Prophecy,</hi> of <hi>Miracles</hi> and
<hi>Healing,</hi> were as naturally diffused by them as
the <hi>Sun</hi> sheds <hi>light</hi> and <hi>beams.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now I speak of <hi>Miracles,</hi> methinks the
<hi>persons</hi> were the greatest, upon whom this holy
<hi>Spirit</hi> did thus pour forth his <hi>gifts.</hi> That men
not bred to <hi>Letters</hi> should suddenly grow <hi>wise,</hi>
and be every one a <hi>School</hi> and <hi>Athens</hi> to himself;
to be able to maintain <hi>Disputes</hi> with great <hi>Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars</hi>
of all <hi>Sects;</hi> to make a <hi>Sadducee</hi> confess there
was a <hi>Resurrection,</hi> and to make a <hi>Pharisee</hi> recant
his <hi>false glosses</hi> on the <hi>Law;</hi> nay, to make <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotles
school</hi> send forth <hi>Disciples</hi> unto <hi>Christ,</hi> and
to erect a <hi>new Church</hi> in <hi>Plato</hi>'s Commonwealth; to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60020:14"/>
see a <hi>Zeno</hi> or <hi>Chrysippus</hi> surrender up his <hi>Chair,</hi>
and sit at the feet of a poor <hi>Fisherman</hi> inspired;
to hear an <hi>Apollos</hi> so eloquent in Preaching, as
if some <hi>Tully</hi> or <hi>Demosthenes</hi> were got up into the
Pulpit; to hear men speak all <hi>Languages,</hi> who
had learned no <hi>Tongue</hi> but one, so as to be
thought <hi>Natives</hi> in all <hi>Countries</hi> where they
came, and who travelled through the <hi>World,</hi> yet
never went from <hi>home;</hi> lastly, to see a plain
unskilful man, who never heard of <hi>Galen,</hi> and
to whom <hi>Hippocrates</hi> was utterly unknown,
without the help of <hi>medicines</hi> do Cures beyond
the power of <hi>Physick,</hi> to cure <hi>Palsies, Fevers,
Dropsies, Gouts,</hi> by the bare virtue of a <hi>Word;</hi> to
make <hi>blind men</hi> see, and <hi>lame men</hi> walk, by virtue
of a <hi>Touch;</hi> nay, to make their <hi>shadows</hi> do the
business of <hi>Physicians,</hi> and to cure all Diseases by
their bare <hi>shadows</hi> passing by: These, these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
were <hi>gifts</hi> which bore down the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them; these changed the face of <hi>Empires,</hi>
and gave new form to <hi>States;</hi> converted <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi>
into <hi>Christians,</hi> and <hi>Idolaters</hi> to <hi>Saints.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, whether all these <hi>gifts,</hi> or any <hi>one</hi> of
these, were the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or <hi>gift</hi> here given to this
<hi>Bishop,</hi> because this <hi>Text</hi> is silent, I cannot well
determine. <hi>Grotius</hi> thinks it was the <hi>gift of
Tongues;</hi> and perhaps his reason was, because
being an <hi>Evangelist</hi> and <hi>Co-adjutor</hi> to St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:60020:15"/>
whose task and business 'twas to preach the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel</hi>
to all <hi>Nations,</hi> this could not well be done
without the Language of all <hi>Nations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Others think it was the <hi>gift of Wisdom,</hi> by
which without the help of Books he was inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with <hi>Knowledge.</hi> But then why did St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
in the Verse next before this Text, bid him im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
himself by study, and <hi>addict himself to read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and exhortation till he came?</hi> Where by <hi>Reading</hi>
sure is meant the <hi>Theory</hi> of <hi>Knowledge,</hi> by <hi>Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi>
the <hi>exercise</hi> and reduction of it into <hi>practice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Others therefore think, that here is meant
the <hi>gift of Healing.</hi> But then St. <hi>Chrysostoms</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
in his <hi>Homily</hi> on that <hi>Text, Drink no longer
Water, but use a little Wine for thy Stomachs sake and
often Infirmities,</hi> will deserve to be considered,
and to have the Question askt, Why, if he had
the <hi>gift of Healing,</hi> did he not <hi>heal</hi> himself? un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
this may be an Answer, That being but a
<hi>Novice,</hi> or <hi>young man,</hi> endued with the <hi>gifts</hi> and
<hi>parts</hi> of <hi>old,</hi> God would not give him leave to
cure this <hi>weaknesse</hi> in himself, lest his <hi>gift of
Knowledge</hi> should swell and <hi>puff him up.</hi> Since
the <hi>gifts</hi> of the <hi>holy Ghost</hi> are not so secure from
danger, but that they may degenerate into <hi>high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindednesse</hi>
and <hi>pride.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nay, this it seems was St. <hi>Pauls</hi> very case;
who though he had the <hi>gift of healing</hi> to that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60020:15"/>
degree, as to be able to raise men from
the dead; yet after his <hi>strange Rapture</hi> up into the
third Heaven, after all the glorious <hi>Visions</hi> and
<hi>Revelations</hi> of that place, lest he should be <hi>exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi>
above the <hi>measure</hi> of a man, <hi>A thorn in the flesh,</hi>
called <hi>the Messenger of Satan,</hi> was sent to <hi>buffet</hi>
him, and to humble him again: in the 12.
Chapter of the 2. Epistle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> at
the 7. Verse. Where some too injuriously, and
too unchastely too, by that <hi>thorn in the flesh</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
some <hi>concupiscence</hi> or <hi>lust;</hi> but he himself
calls it an <hi>infirmity</hi> or <hi>weaknesse,</hi> for which his <hi>gift
of Healing</hi> could not contrive a <hi>cure;</hi> as you may
gather from the 8, &amp; 9. Verses of that Chapter.</p>
               <p>But now after all this which I hitherto have
said, what if the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or <hi>gift,</hi> here mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in this <hi>Text,</hi> were none of all these, but the
very <hi>Office</hi> of a Bishop, here given him by <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy,
with the laying on of hands?</hi> Certainly, if
those <hi>ancient Fathers</hi> and <hi>great Lights</hi> of the
Church, who living near the <hi>Spring-head</hi> did
see the <hi>stream</hi> run clear, wrote not by a false
light, which deceived themselves and others;
St. <hi>Jerome, Ambrose, Haymo, Primasius,</hi> and some
others, in which number was <hi>Lyranus,</hi> were of
this Opinion. Nay, the 2. <hi>Canon</hi> of the <hi>Nicene
Council,</hi> the 18. <hi>Canon</hi> of the <hi>Council of Ancyra,</hi> the
101. <hi>Canon</hi> of the <hi>Council</hi> called in <hi>Africk,</hi> do
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60020:16"/>
speak as if those <hi>Fathers</hi> did either make those
<hi>Canons,</hi> or did inspire the pen of the <hi>Scribe</hi> or <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gister</hi>
who wrote them. And truly, if I may
joyn <hi>Historians</hi> to those <hi>Councils</hi> and those <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
Eusebius</hi> in his 6. Book and 8. Chapter,
<hi>Socrates</hi> in his 7. Book and 41. Chapter, do
make the <hi>word</hi>

                  </gap>, the last <hi>word</hi> in this
Text, bear the same sense and meaning with
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which signifies not a <hi>Presbytery of El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>
but the very <hi>Office</hi> of an <hi>Elder,</hi> ordained and
made a <hi>Bishop.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed this Text in <hi>Greek,</hi> if we transpose the
words a little, doth seem to favor this Opinion,
and may be made to run thus; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.
That is, <hi>Neglect not the gift of Eldership
which is in thee, which was given thee by Prophecy,
with the laying on of Hands.</hi> Where it would not
be hard to prove to you by the best primitive
<hi>Records,</hi> That the word <hi>Eldership,</hi> where ere 'tis
used in the Writings of the <hi>New Testament,</hi> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
the <hi>dignity</hi> and <hi>office</hi> of a <hi>Bishop.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nay, if you will hear me quote a more <hi>authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Author</hi> then all these, not for his <hi>integrity,</hi>
(for he was no <hi>friend</hi> to <hi>Bishops</hi>) nor yet for his
<hi>parts,</hi> (for St. <hi>Jerome</hi> sure had greater) but for
his <hi>authority,</hi> which ought not to be question'd,
when the <hi>Enemy</hi> of a <hi>cause</hi> bears witness to the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60020:16"/>
                  <hi>Truth;</hi> Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> himself was of this Opinion;
who in the 4. Book of his <hi>Institutions,</hi> and the
3. Chapter, hath translated this <hi>Greek Text</hi> into
this <hi>modern Latine, Fac ut gratia quam per manuum
impositionem accepisti, cum te Presbyterum crearem,
non sit irrita.</hi> Take heed the <hi>grace</hi> or <hi>favour</hi>
which was bestowed upon thee by the <hi>laying on

not given thee in vain. Where though he do

                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
a <hi>grace</hi> or <hi>favour,</hi> as the other doth a <hi>gift;</hi>
yet he did not erre when he made both <hi>words</hi>
agree in this, that in this place they signifie an
<hi>Office</hi> given by the <hi>Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what need I quote <hi>Authorities</hi> either <hi>anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent</hi>
or more <hi>modern,</hi> when I have a clear <hi>demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration</hi>
of Gods <hi>Spirit,</hi> that by the <hi>gift</hi> here in
this place is meant an <hi>Office given?</hi> For doth
not St. <hi>Paul</hi> remove all Clouds, and lend a <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beam</hi>
to this Text, in the 4. Chapter of the <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians,</hi>
from the 8. to the 12. Verse? Doth he not
there strike one of the chief strings in <hi>Davids
harp,</hi> and say, That <hi>Christ ascended up on high, that
he led captivity captive, and that he gave gifts to men?</hi>
And what were those <hi>gifts?</hi> The 11. Verse re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves
you; they were the several <hi>Offices</hi> and
<hi>Orders</hi> in his <hi>Church: He gave some Apostles, some
Prophets, some Evangelists, some Pastors,</hi> and <hi>some
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60020:17"/>
Teachers;</hi> as you may read in that place. And
all this <hi>for the perfecting of the Saints, for the work
of the Ministry, for the building of his Church;</hi> as the
End is exprest in the 12. Verse of that Chapter.</p>
               <p>Onely by the way I cannot but observe,
That in the bestowing of those <hi>gifts,</hi> those
Church-<hi>Offices</hi> and <hi>Functions,</hi> as none were to
partake them without <hi>commission</hi> from the
<hi>Church;</hi> so lest the <hi>Church</hi> should erre in the <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission</hi>
of the persons, they still brought their
<hi>Letters Testimonial</hi> from Gods <hi>Spirit.</hi> He first by
some <hi>Prophet</hi> designed and named them to their
<hi>Office,</hi> before the <hi>Church</hi> drew up their <hi>Patent,</hi> by
the Imposition of their <hi>Hands.</hi> Which is the
<hi>Conge D'Eslire,</hi> or third part of this Text, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the <hi>Prophecies</hi> which markt out this <hi>Bishop</hi>
for his <hi>See.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> What <hi>Prophet</hi> 'twas,<note place="margin">His Desig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</note> or whether <hi>one</hi> or <hi>many,</hi>
by whom the <hi>holy Ghost</hi> design'd this <hi>Bishop</hi> to
his <hi>Office,</hi> is wrapt up in a Cloud which affords
no light to see by. But sure 'twas none of the
<hi>old Prophets,</hi> who though they were called <hi>Seers,</hi>
yet this <hi>person</hi> stood too distant to fall within
their <hi>view.</hi> And because the name of the <hi>new
Prophet</hi> is not set down in particular, the most
we can do is to seek for him by conjecture.</p>
               <p>In the 21. Chapter of the <hi>Acts,</hi> at the 8, 9.
Verses, 'tis said, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his Travels with
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60020:17"/>
this <hi>Disciple</hi> in his Train, came to <hi>Caesarea,</hi> where
dwelt <hi>Philip the Evangelist; Into whose house they
entered, and abode there many dayes:</hi> And that <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip
had four daughters, Virgins, which did prophesie.</hi>
Again, 'tis said at the 10, 11. Verses of that
Chapter, that <hi>Whilest they staid there, a certain Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
named</hi> Agabus <hi>came down from</hi> Judaea, <hi>who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesied
against</hi> Pauls <hi>going to</hi> Jerusalem. Now
the circumstances of Persons, Time and Place
thus laid together, have made it probable to
some, that some one of these <hi>She-prophetesses,</hi>
conversing daily with him, or that <hi>Agabus,</hi> who
<hi>forewarned</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> of his <hi>imprisonment</hi> and <hi>bonds,</hi>
were opportunely moved by Gods <hi>Spirit</hi> in that
place, to nominate this <hi>Timothy</hi> to his <hi>Bishoprick</hi>
and <hi>Charge,</hi> of which St. <hi>Paul</hi> no longer could be
an <hi>Over-seer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And great reason there was why the <hi>Prophets</hi>
should have a hand in all such sacred <hi>Nominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</hi>
who standing next to the <hi>Apostles</hi> in the <hi>Bill</hi>

out his <hi>Diocese</hi> where he was to reside, with the
full power of an <hi>Apostle</hi> fixt and seated to his
<hi>charge.</hi> So that the business of those <hi>Prophets</hi>
was partly to <hi>foretell</hi> the contingent future acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
which were to happen in the <hi>Church,</hi> part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to <hi>provide</hi> fit <hi>Guides</hi> and <hi>Rulers</hi> for it.</p>
               <p>But whoe're the <hi>Prophet</hi> was (for 'tis but Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity
to search) the same holy <hi>Spirit</hi> which did
consecrate our <hi>Saviour</hi> to be the <hi>Head</hi> of the
<hi>Church,</hi> and to publish his own <hi>Gospel,</hi> in the
4. Chapter of St. <hi>Luke</hi> at the 18. Verse, where
he sayes, and quotes the Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> for it, <hi>The
spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed
me to preach the Gospel;</hi> and the same holy <hi>Spirit</hi>
who commissioned the <hi>Apostles</hi> to go and plant
a <hi>Church</hi> in all <hi>Nations</hi> of the World; the same
holy <hi>Spirit,</hi> I say, did direct and guide the <hi>Church</hi>
in the choice of the <hi>persons</hi> who were to <hi>follow</hi>
and <hi>succeed</hi> them.</p>
               <p>For here if I may draw waters from the same
<hi>Fountains</hi> and <hi>Spring-heads</hi> from whence others
have poured forth their <hi>Discourses</hi> on this <hi>subject,</hi>
In the first Age of the <hi>Church,</hi> when 'twas but
yet a tender <hi>plant,</hi> the first businesse of the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles</hi>
was in their Travels through the World, to
convert it from <hi>Idolatrie,</hi> and to gain <hi>Proselytes</hi>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:60020:18"/>
to <hi>Christ.</hi> When the number of <hi>Believers</hi> was
every where increast, and the name of <hi>Christian,</hi>
which at first began at <hi>Antioch,</hi> was every where
disperst as far as Words were <hi>Names</hi> of <hi>persons;</hi>
the next business of the <hi>Apostles</hi> (whose <hi>commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi>
like the <hi>Sun</hi>'s was never to stand still or
settle in one place, but still to move like him
from one Countrey to another) was to mould
their new <hi>Believers</hi> into <hi>well-form'd</hi> and <hi>govern'd
Churches,</hi> especially in great <hi>Cities,</hi> such as <hi>Ephesus</hi>
and <hi>Corinth;</hi> and to appoint them <hi>Over-seers,</hi>
who should both <hi>teach</hi> and <hi>rule</hi> the <hi>Flock:</hi> lest
being left like <hi>Sheep</hi> without a <hi>Shepherd</hi> to o're<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look
them, they either should be swallowed up
by their own <hi>Heresies</hi> and <hi>Schisms,</hi> or should
break out of the <hi>Fold,</hi> and relapse back again to
<hi>Heathens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These <hi>Overseers,</hi> or, as the Scripture calls
them, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>These Bishops of the
Flock,</hi> they were compelled to chuse out of their
new <hi>Converts</hi> and <hi>Disciples;</hi> who in that infancy
of time, that famine of great Parts, were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
men whose <hi>Faith</hi> was far greater then their
<hi>Knowledge;</hi> men not bred in <hi>Schools,</hi> unskilled
in <hi>Tongues</hi> and <hi>Arts,</hi> especially the Art <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
the <hi>Art</hi> of <hi>Ruling</hi> well. Indeed they
were such men as St. <hi>Paul</hi> describes in that
mean and humble Map which he drew of those
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60020:19"/>
                  <hi>Times,</hi> in the first Chapter of his first Epistle to
the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> at the 26. and 27. Verses, where
he sayes, <hi>Ye see your calling, Brethren, how that not
many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not
many noble are called: But God hath chosen the foolish
things of the World to confound the wise, and weak
things of the World to confound the mighty; and base
things, and things despised, and things that are not,
hath God chosen, to annihilate and bring to nought the
things that are.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To supply this great Defect, the <hi>holy Ghost</hi> was
fain to assist the very <hi>Apostles</hi> in the making of
their <hi>choices,</hi> and to furnish men with <hi>gifts</hi> and
<hi>parts</hi> which might fit them for <hi>Elections.</hi>
Nay, the persons generally were so <hi>ungifted, raw,
unlearned,</hi> in all kinds so unfit to <hi>rule</hi> or <hi>govern</hi>
in the Church, that he was fain to qualifie
them in a way of <hi>new creation,</hi> to make <hi>Things
which were not bring to nought the things that were;</hi>
to give <hi>form</hi> to <hi>shapelesse</hi> matter, to change their
<hi>Ignorance</hi> to <hi>Knowledge,</hi> to make <hi>unwise men wise,</hi>
and to raise their <hi>Wisdom</hi> out of <hi>nothing;</hi> to call
<hi>Light</hi> out of <hi>Darknesse,</hi> and then divide it into
<hi>Stars;</hi> to make those learned <hi>Shepherds</hi> who
were but lately <hi>Sheep,</hi> able to defend their <hi>Flocks</hi>
from the most <hi>fierce</hi> and <hi>learned Wolves:</hi> In short,
to call a <hi>Church</hi> out of a <hi>Chaos,</hi> and give a beauty
to <hi>confusion;</hi> to dispose the several parts into
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:60020:19"/>
well-tuned <hi>Orbes</hi> and <hi>Spheres;</hi> to place <hi>great
Lights</hi> in this new <hi>Firmament,</hi> which were to <hi>rule
the Day,</hi> and <hi>lesser Lights</hi> to drive and chace away
the <hi>Night;</hi> was a Work which required the <hi>Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination</hi>
of Gods <hi>Spirit,</hi> to hold a Torch to those
who had else stood in the dark.</p>
               <p>And this is that which St. <hi>Chrysostom, Oecume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,
Theodoret, Theophylact,</hi> and many other anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Writers have very well observed. For
St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> in his Comment upon this very
Text sayes, that in this <hi>childhood,</hi> this <hi>nonage</hi>
of the <hi>Church,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, That no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
was done as <hi>Mans Wisdome</hi> did direct;
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, but by the <hi>direction</hi> of Gods <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit:</hi>
whose business 'twas not onely <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
to foretell things to <hi>come;</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
but to reveal things <hi>present</hi> too, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in the choice of fit <hi>Rulers</hi> in the <hi>Church.
Clemens Romanus</hi> speaking of those Rulers sayes,
That the first <hi>Bishops</hi> which were made were
made by the <hi>Apostles, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, having
tryed them by the Spirit. Oecumenius</hi> also speaks as if
the other held his pen, and sayes almost in the
same form of words, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
<hi>The first Bishops were made Bishops by the appointment
of Gods Spirit.</hi> Thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> were
of <hi>Preachers</hi> made <hi>Apostles, Act.</hi> 13. 2. thus <hi>Titus</hi>
was made <hi>Metropolitane</hi> of <hi>Creet, Tit.</hi> 1. 5. and thus
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:60020:20"/>
                  <hi>Timothy</hi> in this Text was made the first <hi>Ephesian
Bishop,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, by the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of him by the <hi>Prophets.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nay, <hi>Eusebius</hi> in the third Book of his <hi>Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical
History,</hi> taking <hi>Clemens</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> for his
Chronologer and Warrant, sayes, That this
way of making <hi>Bishops,</hi> by the <hi>Appointment of Gods
Spirit,</hi> was observed in the <hi>Church</hi> till the <hi>death</hi> of
St. <hi>John,</hi> who after his return from his <hi>banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
to <hi>Ephesus,</hi> being intreated by the <hi>Church</hi>
there to provide for <hi>succession,</hi> went through all
the Regions near in a holy <hi>Visitation,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
and <hi>ordained such
a Clergie as the holy Ghost revealed.</hi> So that they
who have been curious to compute St. <hi>Johns re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,</hi>
which was in the Reign of <hi>Nerva,</hi> the 98.
<hi>year</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> 30. years after St. <hi>Pauls martyrdom,</hi>
do reckon, That from the day of <hi>Pentecost,</hi> in
which the <hi>holy Ghost</hi> descended on the <hi>Apostles</hi>
in <hi>cloven Tongues</hi> of fire, to the time of St. <hi>John</hi>'s
death, which was in the 100. <hi>year</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> this
way of making <hi>Bishops</hi> by the <hi>designation</hi> of Gods
<hi>Spirit,</hi> continued in the Church 66. years com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete.</p>
               <p>At which time the <hi>Church</hi> having taken ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
root, and from a grain of <hi>Mustard-seed</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
become a spacious <hi>Tree,</hi> able to diffuse it self
without <hi>Miracles</hi> and <hi>Wonders,</hi> those <hi>gifts</hi> of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60020:20"/>
Gods <hi>Spirit</hi> which had brought it to this
Growth, and had every where furnisht it with
<hi>Rulers</hi> sent from <hi>Heaven,</hi> like the <hi>Manna</hi> in the
Scripture, ceast to fall on those who had
now the <hi>Promised Land</hi> given to them in pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session.</p>
               <p>But yet though all this be true, we are
not to suppose that Gods <hi>Spirit</hi> did so whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ingrosse this <hi>businesse</hi> to himself, as to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude
those <hi>new Rulers</hi> on the <hi>Church</hi> without
their <hi>Allowance</hi> and <hi>Approbation</hi> too. He one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
did <hi>direct</hi> and <hi>name</hi> and <hi>recommend them;</hi>
'twas left to the <hi>Church</hi> to <hi>admit</hi> them to their
<hi>Cures:</hi> he but <hi>designed</hi> the Persons, the <hi>Church</hi>
gave them <hi>Ordination,</hi> by the <hi>laying on of the
Hands of the Presbytery.</hi> Which describes to
us the <hi>Forme</hi> of this <hi>Bishops Consecration,</hi> and
comes in the fourth place to be considered and
examined.</p>
               <p>'Tis observed, that the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God, who <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
in the <hi>Jewish Church</hi> spoke by the several spark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
of those <hi>precious stones</hi> or <hi>Jewels,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The form of his Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration.</note> which

where a <hi>Diamond</hi> and <hi>Amethyst</hi> gave <hi>Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi>
and <hi>Answers,</hi> and an <hi>Agate</hi> might be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned
into the number of the <hi>Prophets,</hi> remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
those <hi>precious stones</hi> into the <hi>twelve</hi> Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
and made them twelve Foundation-<hi>stones</hi>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:60020:21"/>
in the <hi>new Building</hi> of <hi>Christs Church;</hi> as you may
read in the 21. Chapter of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> at the
18, 19. Verses.</p>
               <p>Certainly, whatever in that <hi>Church</hi> condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Order,</hi> whatever might be
made a <hi>patterne</hi> for <hi>religious Imitation,</hi> the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Church</hi> transcribed as holy <hi>Platformes</hi> of
their <hi>building.</hi> The Waters of <hi>Baptism,</hi> the
Bread and Wine in the other <hi>Sacrament,</hi> the
Distinction of their <hi>Hierarchie</hi> into <hi>Higher
Priests</hi> and <hi>Lower,</hi> and the <hi>Ordination</hi> of those
<hi>Priests</hi> by the <hi>laying on of Hands,</hi> were bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
and translated from the <hi>old Temple</hi> to
the <hi>new.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the pursuit and handling of which <hi>last,</hi>
namely, the <hi>laying on of Hands,</hi> (which is the
proper <hi>Theme</hi> and <hi>Subject</hi> of this Text) two
things I will observe to you: First, the <hi>several
Ends</hi> and <hi>Uses</hi> to which it was <hi>applied:</hi> next, who
the <hi>Persons</hi> were who were commissioned to
<hi>apply</hi> it.</p>
               <p>First, as for the <hi>several Ends and Uses of this
Ceremony,</hi> in the times of the <hi>Old Testament</hi>
'twas sometimes made use of in a way or
forme of <hi>Blessing.</hi> Thus <hi>Jacob laid his hands</hi>
upon the two <hi>sonnes</hi> of <hi>Joseph,</hi> and <hi>blest them</hi>
on his Death-bed; in the 48. Chapter of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesis,</hi>
at the 14. Verse. Nay, in this way of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:60020:21"/>
                  <hi>blessing,</hi> if we may believe <hi>Lipsius</hi> in his Book
<hi>De Cruce,</hi> or <hi>several sorts of Crosses,</hi> the same
holy <hi>Spirit</hi> who revealed the <hi>Shiloh</hi> to him,
the promised <hi>Messias, Christ,</hi> who suffered on
the <hi>Crosse,</hi> did direct and guide his Hands
to do something like a <hi>Christian:</hi> for in lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his <hi>right hand</hi> on the <hi>younger</hi> Son, and his
left hand on the <hi>elder,</hi> the <hi>crosse postures</hi> of the
Children on whom he laid his hands, made his
<hi>Imposition</hi> bear the <hi>figure</hi> of a <hi>Crosse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next, this <hi>laying on of hands</hi> was sometimes
made use of in the making and <hi>creation</hi> of a
great Minister of <hi>State.</hi> Thus <hi>Moses</hi> did chuse
<hi>Josuah</hi> to succeed him in his Power, in the 27.
Chapter of <hi>Numbers,</hi> at the last Verse. And thus
<hi>Senators</hi> were admitted into the great <hi>Sanedrim</hi>
or <hi>Council, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, by the laying on of the
hands</hi> of some of the elder Senators; as the <hi>Thal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mudists</hi>
report.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>New Testament</hi> this <hi>Ceremony</hi> was
as diversly applied. Our Saviour <hi>Christ laid
his hands upon the little children brought unto him,
and blest them,</hi> sayes the Text, of which this
was the <hi>mark</hi> and <hi>signe;</hi> in the 10. Chapter
of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> at the 16. Verse. 'Twas also
made use of in the <hi>Visitation</hi> of the Sick; in
the 16. Chapter of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> at the 18. Verse.
But it never was omitted in the <hi>Consecration</hi>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:60020:22"/>
of a <hi>Bishop, Ordination</hi> of a <hi>Priest,</hi> nay, of a
<hi>Deacon</hi> too. Onely to make it the more <hi>so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne</hi>
and <hi>effectuall,</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> added usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
their <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Fastings</hi> too. Thus Saint
<hi>Paul</hi> was made a <hi>Preacher</hi> by the <hi>laying on of
hands,</hi> in the 9. Chapter of the <hi>Acts,</hi> at the
12. Verse. And thus Saint <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas</hi>
were of <hi>Preachers</hi> made <hi>Apostles:</hi> the <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
and Prophets which were at</hi> Antioch <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
fasted, and prayed, and laid their hands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, sent them away;</hi> in the 13. Chapter of
the <hi>Acts,</hi> at the 3. Verse. And thus <hi>Timothy</hi> in
this Text was made the <hi>first Bishop</hi> of <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, by the laying on of
Hands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But why by the <hi>laying on of Hands?</hi> some
disputing men have ask'd. Why by such a
<hi>Forme,</hi> such a <hi>Ceremony</hi> as this? Why not by
a <hi>Licence</hi> drawne up in Writing from the
<hi>Church?</hi> Nay, sayes the <hi>Independent Preacher,</hi>
by a <hi>Licence</hi> from the <hi>State?</hi> I must confesse
the Question is not so hardly answered as
his, who askt what God did before he made
the World, what kind of <hi>Fruit</hi> 'twas by
which our first Parents fell, where they had
the <hi>Needle</hi> which stitch'd their <hi>Leaves</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
or where they had the <hi>Thred</hi> before the
Art of <hi>Spinning</hi> was found out. For here
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:60020:22"/>
suppose I should reply, and give this for
an Answer, That 'twas Gods Will to have it
so, so directing by his <hi>Spirit:</hi> Who then <hi>art
thou, O Man, who darest dispute with God?</hi> Must
the <hi>Potter</hi> give a Reason of his Actions to his
<hi>Clay?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But God, who made the World in <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
Weight</hi> and <hi>Measure,</hi> who never did a
thing superfluous or vaine, but made <hi>Order</hi>
to distinguish his <hi>Creation</hi> from a <hi>Chaos,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which his six dayes <hi>Works</hi> had still lain in a
<hi>confusion,</hi> proceeded by a <hi>Reason,</hi> nay, a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of <hi>Reasons,</hi> in this way of giving <hi>Order</hi> to
his <hi>Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For, First, what would men have him
do? Issue forth <hi>commissions</hi> to the <hi>Rulers</hi> of
his Church, as he did to the <hi>Apostles,</hi> in <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles</hi>
nad <hi>Wonders?</hi> Had he gone no further,
he must have still wrought <hi>Wonders,</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
the doubting World that they were
<hi>Rulers</hi> sent by him. And so when such <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,</hi>
such <hi>Signes</hi> and <hi>Wonders</hi> ceast, the Church
for want of <hi>Miracles</hi> must have wanted <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,</hi>
and then for want of <hi>Rulers</hi> must have
ceast to be a <hi>Church.</hi> The <hi>Gifts</hi> of the <hi>Holy
Ghost,</hi> which I mentioned to you before,
though they made men fit, and prepared
them to be <hi>Rulers;</hi> yet being <hi>invisible, secret,</hi>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:60020:23"/>
and <hi>unseen,</hi> without some outward <hi>mark</hi> to
make them <hi>own'd</hi> and <hi>knowne,</hi> to those who
knew them not would but have past for <hi>private
Spirit,</hi> not able to gain <hi>publick faith</hi> to the persons
thus <hi>commission'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some <hi>outward Mark</hi> was needful then to
let the People know who the <hi>Persons</hi> were
whom God designed to be their <hi>Guides.</hi> As
to let the <hi>Jews</hi> know that <hi>Christ</hi> was to be
their <hi>Head,</hi> the Holy <hi>Ghost</hi> descended on
him in the <hi>figure of a Dove;</hi> and to let all
<hi>Nations</hi> know who were to be their <hi>Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,</hi>
in the sight of all Nations then assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> the Holy <hi>Ghost</hi> fell on the
<hi>Apostles</hi> in <hi>cloven Tongues of fire:</hi> So to let
after-Ages know who were to be their <hi>Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>
the same Holy <hi>Ghost</hi> appointed the <hi>lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on of Hands,</hi> as the way and <hi>forme</hi> of issu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forth his <hi>commissions</hi> by the <hi>Church.</hi> And the
Reasons of this <hi>Ceremony</hi> were yet more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
these.</p>
               <p>There be two wayes, sayes the Civil Law,
by which men take <hi>possession,</hi> and so gaine
a <hi>propriety</hi> in a thing which was not theirs.
If it be a <hi>thing immoveable,</hi> as Lands, Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
or Houses, by treading on the Soyle
they take Possession by their <hi>Feet;</hi> if it be
a <hi>moveable,</hi> as Goods, Money, Ware or Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:60020:23"/>
to gaine to themselves a <hi>property,</hi> they
take possession by their <hi>Hands.</hi> So when
God called a Man to be his <hi>Minister</hi> or <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,</hi>
as to <hi>preach,</hi> or beare some <hi>publick Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice</hi>
in his Church, by the <hi>Hands</hi> of his <hi>Church</hi>
he took <hi>possession</hi> of him, and the person
thus <hi>laid Hands on</hi> was no more his <hi>owne,</hi> but
<hi>Gods.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next, this <hi>laying on of Hands,</hi> as it was a
forme of <hi>Alienation,</hi> by which the person thus
<hi>ordained</hi> did quit all <hi>Interest</hi> in himself, and
past himself away to the <hi>Service</hi> of <hi>Gods
Church;</hi> so it was a <hi>forme</hi> of <hi>Hallowing</hi> and
<hi>Consecration</hi> too. The Case stood with men
<hi>ordained</hi> as it did with other things made <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi>
As for Example, In the Old Testament,
a Beast in the <hi>herd</hi> was but a <hi>common crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
of the Field, indifferent for the <hi>Sham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles</hi>
or to be made a <hi>Sacrifice:</hi> But being
fetcht from thence and brought into the
<hi>Temple,</hi> when the <hi>Priests</hi> which waited there
had <hi>laid their hands upon him,</hi> he was no more
one of the <hi>herd,</hi> but an <hi>Oblation</hi> for the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar;</hi>
and of a <hi>Beast</hi> became the <hi>Expiation</hi> of a
Sinne. The Stones in the <hi>Quarrey</hi> are but
vulgar, <hi>common stones,</hi> indifferent to be wrought
into a <hi>Kitchin</hi> or a <hi>Temple:</hi> But being fetcht
from thence, and made a <hi>consecrated Building,</hi>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:60020:24"/>
that which was a <hi>common heap</hi> becomes a <hi>house
of Prayer.</hi> Once more: The Waters run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in the <hi>Streame,</hi> or drawne out of the
<hi>Well,</hi> are but a <hi>common Element,</hi> no holier then
the <hi>Streame:</hi> But being poured into the <hi>Font,</hi>
and there applied to <hi>Baptisme,</hi> that which
was <hi>common Water</hi> puts on the nature of a
<hi>Sacrament.</hi> And I might say as much of the
<hi>Lords Supper</hi> too; The <hi>bread</hi> in the common
<hi>lump</hi> is indifferent for all Tables, no holier
then the Sheafe, or Corne ungathered in the
Field: But being made into a <hi>Loafe,</hi> and
set upon the <hi>holy Table,</hi> and there being tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
and <hi>hallowed</hi> by the <hi>Priest,</hi> that which
was a <hi>Loafe</hi> becomes the <hi>body</hi> of our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</hi>
In short, as <hi>Holinesse,</hi> in the best and
strictest Definition of it, is nothing but the
<hi>separation</hi> or <hi>apartment</hi> of a thing from a <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
use</hi> to a <hi>religious</hi> and <hi>divine,</hi> (as the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath</hi>
was called <hi>holy,</hi> because a <hi>common</hi> part of
Time was divided from the rest, and allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to <hi>Gods service:)</hi> so a man thus <hi>ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
by the <hi>laying on of hands,</hi> became a person
<hi>separated</hi> from the <hi>common heap</hi> of Men, a person
<hi>hallowed</hi> for a <hi>Work</hi> whose Institution was
<hi>divine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>how shall men preach except they be
sent?</hi> sayes Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> in the 10. Chapter of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:60020:24"/>
the <hi>Romans,</hi> at the 15. Verse. Where the
Question is not put as if it were <hi>physically</hi>
impossible for men to preach to others with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>Authority</hi> or <hi>Licence</hi> from the <hi>Church.</hi> In
our late licencious Times, where Men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired
themselves, the Cobler, Weaver, Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,
and Lay-preaching Souldier did it, and
went up into the Pulpit with a Sword by
their Side, or with an Awle, or Shuttle, or
Trowel in their Hand. But <hi>Quo Jure?</hi>
Where was their <hi>Warrant</hi> or <hi>Commission</hi> to
do so? Who signed and sealed their <hi>Patent</hi>
by the <hi>laying on of hands?</hi> Certainly, if Men
have not power to <hi>preach</hi> without this <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorizing
Forme,</hi> I am not <hi>Erastian</hi> enough to
believe that they may assume the <hi>power</hi>
and <hi>usage</hi> of the <hi>Keyes, Excommunicate, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine,
Confirme, Deliver up to Satan, and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicially
passe Censures upon Schismes, Heresies and
Scandals.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This then being clear, the next thing to
be enquired is, who the <hi>Persons</hi> were who
were <hi>commissioned</hi> to do this. If we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<hi>Irenaeus, Eusebius</hi> and <hi>Tertullian,</hi> the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles</hi>
singly did it by their <hi>laying on of hands.</hi>
Thus <hi>Polycarp</hi> at <hi>Smyrna</hi> was made a <hi>Bishop</hi>
by Saint <hi>John,</hi> thus <hi>Euodius</hi> at <hi>Antioch</hi> was
made a <hi>Bishop</hi> by Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> and thus by
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:60020:25"/>
the same hands were <hi>Linus, Cletus, Clemens
Romanus</hi> made at <hi>Rome.</hi> Nay, in the first
Chapter of the second Epistle to <hi>Timothy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> at
the sixth Verse, 'tis said, That by Saint
<hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>hands alone</hi> this <hi>Bishop</hi> was <hi>ordained;
Stir up the Gift of God which is in thee,</hi> sayes the
Apostle in that place, which was given thee <hi>by
the putting on of my hands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Why is there mention made then in this
Text of a <hi>Presbytery?</hi> What means this <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery,</hi>
with their <hi>laying on of hands?</hi> Do you
not wonder, <hi>holy Fathers,</hi> that the same Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
<hi>Calvin,</hi> who took this Word <hi>Presbytery</hi>
for the <hi>Office</hi> of an <hi>Elder,</hi> should from the
same Word set up his <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, his
<hi>compounded mixt Presbytery</hi> of <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Lay-Elders?</hi>
A thing of which <hi>Aërius</hi> the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
never dreamt, nor did <hi>Iscbyras</hi> or <hi>Collu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus</hi>
ever receive into their Fancy. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
those famous <hi>Lights</hi> and <hi>Fathers</hi> of the
Church, Saint <hi>Chrysostome, Theodoret, Theophy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lact,</hi>
and others, were so far from allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Lay-Elders</hi> in this Work, that they
would not allow a <hi>Presbyter</hi> to <hi>lay hands</hi> upon
a <hi>Bishop; <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
Inferiour Priests assisted not at this higher Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration.</hi>
'Twas still done by an <hi>Apostle,</hi> or
by some other <hi>Bishops<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> at least by <hi>two</hi> or
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:60020:25"/>
                  <hi>three,</hi> say the <hi>Canons</hi> called <hi>Apostolick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which cleares the <hi>seeming contradiction</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
this <hi>Text,</hi> which sayes, That <hi>Timothy</hi>
was <hi>ordained</hi> by the <hi>hands</hi> of the <hi>Presbytery;</hi>
and that other Text 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. which sayes,
That Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ordained him by his <hi>lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on of hands:</hi> Both Texts joyned together
are thus fairly reconciled; he was <hi>ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
by Saint <hi>Paul</hi> assisted by the <hi>Bishops,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
here the <hi>Presbytery</hi> or <hi>Elders</hi> on the
place.</p>
               <p>And now, <hi>holy Fathers,</hi> if you will heare
me draw your Pedigree from the <hi>Spring-head</hi>
downe the <hi>Streame,</hi> your <hi>Order</hi> and the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Church,</hi> with its <hi>Religion</hi> too, had the
same divine <hi>Original,</hi> and derives it self from
<hi>Heaven; God</hi> sent his <hi>Sonne,</hi> his <hi>Sonne</hi> sent
<hi>Apostles,</hi> the <hi>Apostles</hi> made <hi>Bishops,</hi> and those
<hi>Bishops</hi> made their <hi>Successors:</hi> And all this
by one and the same authentick <hi>Patent, As
my Father sent me, so send I you,</hi> sayes Christ
in the 20. Chapter of Saint <hi>John,</hi> at the 21.
Verse. An <hi>Order</hi> which hath stood out all
the <hi>Injuries</hi> of Time, <hi>Persecutions</hi> of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,
<hi>Opposition</hi> of Philosophers, <hi>Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
of Hereticks, even all the <hi>Powers</hi> of Hell,
which have strived to shake it by their <hi>vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence</hi>
and <hi>stormes.</hi> An <hi>Order</hi> which hath fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

our <hi>Calendars</hi> with Saints, our <hi>Histories,</hi>
with Fathers, Holy Confessours and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs.
An <hi>Order</hi> which is promised to be as
lasting as the Sun; for, <hi>Lo, I am with you to
the end of the World,</hi> sayes our Saviour Christ
the <hi>Founder</hi> of your <hi>Order,</hi> in the 28. Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Saint <hi>Matthew,</hi> at the last Verse. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
an <hi>Order</hi> in our <hi>English Church</hi> recovered
out of <hi>Ruines,</hi> made <hi>glorious</hi> after <hi>Shipwreck,</hi>
victorious over the <hi>Rage</hi> and <hi>Sacrilege</hi> of
those who raised a Storme in hope to enrich
themselves with <hi>Spoyles.</hi> In short, an <hi>Order</hi>
which nothing can eclipse, endanger or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to the <hi>Malice</hi> or <hi>Designs</hi> of those who
would destroy it, but the <hi>Negligence</hi> or want
of <hi>care</hi> in those whose <hi>Order</hi> 'tis. Which
should be the last part of this Text, exprest
to us in these words, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Do not
neglect your Gift.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this being a piece of holy Counsel,<note place="margin">The Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</note>
much fitter for Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to preach out of
this Pulpit to Men so like <hi>himself,</hi> then for
<hi>me</hi> so much <hi>inferiour</hi> in <hi>Gifts</hi> and <hi>Station</hi> to you:
For <hi>me</hi> to teach a <hi>Bishop</hi> how to over-look his
<hi>Charge,</hi> to prescribe him <hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>Government,</hi> or
to hold a Candle to him in his <hi>laying on of hands,</hi>
or Work of <hi>Ordination;</hi> for <hi>me</hi> to instruct
him how to admit fit <hi>Pastors</hi> to their <hi>Cures,</hi>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:60020:26"/>
fit <hi>Shepherds</hi> to their <hi>Flocks;</hi> where to let
loose his holy <hi>Thunders,</hi> and to call them
back againe; where to use the <hi>Rod,</hi> and
where to poure in <hi>Oyle;</hi> lastly, how to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
himself with all <hi>Gravity</hi> in publick, and
how to demeane himself with all <hi>Piety</hi> at
home, would be an undertaking like the
foolish Orator's in <hi>Tully,</hi> who in a Speech
to <hi>Hannibal</hi> taught him the <hi>Art</hi> of War; for
which by that great <hi>Souldier</hi> he was accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
mad. Having therefore, <hi>Reverend Fathers,</hi>
profest my <hi>Submission</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi> to those
Rules and Orders which you shall prescribe
to <hi>me,</hi> but my very great unfitnesse to preach
<hi>Lawes</hi> and <hi>Rules</hi> to you; I hope my <hi>Modesty</hi>
will gain me your pardon and excuse, if I
here put a <hi>period</hi> and <hi>conclusion</hi> to this Sermon.</p>
