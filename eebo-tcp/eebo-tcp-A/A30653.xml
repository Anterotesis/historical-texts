            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

particular remark, and are digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the ſpecial obſervation of the Princes eye. While the inferior ſort, that make up the crowd, think it ſufficient for them, that they carry on the common joy, and be obſerved in groſſe, with a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall approbation and acceptance of their well-meaning.

thought rather a means to hinder than advance learning: yet both are tolerated becauſe commonly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to flow, the one from a loyall affection to the Prince, and the other from a well-wiſhing to learning.

To preſent to your moſt ſacred Majeſty a thing of ſo mean worth, is an act (I confeſſe) of great preſumption: yet in regard, that books which but pretend uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe no the ſubjects, have ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily addreſſed themſelves to the patronage of Princes; I want not precedents for ſuch a boldneſs, and

The air is mixt, and unconſtant (as in all Iſlands,) but for the moſt part mild and temperate, not exceeding hot in Summer, nor immoderately cold in Winter.</p>

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56873:7"/>
miſcheifs, (the only means to make the people either more wiſe, or at leaſt leſſe fooliſh,) they were at length happily reduced under the Government of <hi>Alcidruinus,</hi> who by a prudent and dexterous managing of his affairs very much corrected their inſtability.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alcidruinus</hi> was a Prince ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete and abſolute, as there wanted nothing to make him a valiant Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in War, and a wiſe Governor in peace: The times he lived in put him to the tryall in both; the Wars he had occaſion to be involved in were upon juſt and honorable grounds, the reſcuing his Dominions from a ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and turbulent party, which had for many years enthralled them, and diſpoſſeſt him of his Right, forcing him to ſeek for refuge in Forreign parts, a ſad and diſmall fate to the Nation, and as diſmall to him; could his enemies have inherited their wiſhes as they did his Revenues; but God, who miraculouſly preſerves whom he intends to bleſſe, raiſed up the dying hopes of the Nations, and by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of <hi>Piſiſtratus,</hi> a valiant and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56873:7"/>
Commander in the War, brought <hi>Alcidruinus</hi> to the Throne: who by this occaſion had one advantage to enable him above other Princes, that beſides the bountifull endowments of Nature, a ſtately body, majeſticall, Countenance, powerfull Eloquence, and Heroick ſpirit, which he enjoyed in ſo high a degree, that whoſoever was able truly to obſerve him, would judge him worthy of an Empire; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides his Princely Education, which he enjoyed in his Fathers Court, a pious and judicious (but unhappy) Prince: His prime years were exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in adverſity and hard encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, without which men ſeldom ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at any eminent degree of virtue, no mans abilities are put to the tryal, or fully diſcovered, till he hath been proved in the occaſions of good and evil: the way to honour lies through the confines of danger, and none is ſo happy as he that hath ſurvived his miſeries.</p>
            <p>To give a true character of him is beyond my ſkill, and no part of my intention, yet meeting in my paſſage with ſo illuſtrious a perſon, good
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56873:8"/>
manners obliges me to afford him this reſpect. When this noble Prince was inveſted with his Regall Dignities, when War with many ſtruglings and hard labour had brought forth peace, (<hi>A curſt mother hath ſometimes a quiet child</hi>) his care was to procure Alliance and friendſhip with neighbouring Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Enact Laws for the ſafety of his own, in order to the eſtabliſhing of theſe, he had the happineſs to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy a loyall and true hearted Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, conſiſting of men of able parts and liberall education, the Nation had learned, by ſad experience, that illiterate and inferiour perſons were nimble and ſkilfull enough in demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing, but very bunglers in erecting or ſupporting a Government.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not recite either the Laws he made, or the acts he performed, which cannot be compriſed in ſuch a compaſſe as my thoughts have limited out for this whole ſtory. Onely his prudent care and proviſion for the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation of Children muſt not be paſt over in ſilence, being a thing ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable in a Prince. For whereas great perſons uſually take the leaſt
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56873:8"/>
care for this, (though reaſon obliges them to take the greateſt) he vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed to ſuffer his care to condeſcend even to thoſe, who though at preſent but uſeleſs, are yet the future hopes of a Nation, and his Succeſſors Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in reverſion, being aſſured that Education prudently eſtabliſhed by Laws would by degrees make them ſo accuſtomed to vertuous deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that there ſhould not need ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Laws to reſtrain them from Vice: their own inclination would be ſo efficacious, as to conduct them to good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. It's true, ſo long as there are men in the World there will be Vices, but where good Laws are eſtabliſhed for habituating every one from his Cradle to induſtry and good manners before they know how to he lazy, or vitious, this is the certaineſt way to prevent (at leaſt many) miſchiefs, which neglected Education inevitably produces.</p>
            <p>As for Schools (the Country being ſufficiently ſtored in moſt places) he did not much increaſe their number, only he was pleaſed to commit the Government of them to prudent and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56873:9"/>
virtuous perſons, whom he dignified with peculiar favors and priviledges, to incourage them in that moſt uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, but tedious) profeſſion; which in other Nations is uſually thruſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the moſt trivial and deſpicable part of men, and theſe commonly take it only for a ſhift, to be laid aſide when better preferment falls; while thoſe whom a liberall fortune raiſes to a good opinion of themſelves, paſſe it by in ſcorn, and aſpire at thoſe higher profeſſions, which are attended with more ſplendour and wealth. Firſt, he provided that every man ſhould bring up his Children to a Profeſſion (only with ſome exception of Nobles and Gentlemen of ample Eſtates) ſo as he might ſerve his Country either as a Scholar, if he were found fit for any of the Liberall Sciences, or in ſome other profeſſion uſefull to the Nation, and ſuitable to his extraction and abilities. By this he nipt Idleneſs in the very bud, which wherever it prevailes is the ringleader of all Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and the ruine of Families and Countries, being a great error in the politicks of ſome Nations, that by not
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56873:9"/>
ſecuring and providing for the Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of their Youth, nor appointing every man to ſome ſervice and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, they make them Thieves, or Vagabonds, and then are forced to hang them for being ſo.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Beſides, ſuch as were active and induſtrious (if depreſſed by poverty) were encouraged and aſſiſted; and on the contrary, ſuch as were able and ſkilfull, and yet refuſed to imploy themſelves, were as ſurely puniſhed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And certain daies were appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for Sports and Recreations, a piece of prudent and cautelous pollicy. It's eaſie for any man to obſerve, (who hath not made his obſervation alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy) that ſedentary and melancholick perſons, who are either by nature or cuſtom averſe from merriments and recreations, are inclined to malice, peeviſhneſs, diſcontent and envy; fit to deviſe villainy and miſchiefe; and that ſportive Recreations, with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient motion, clear his ſpirits, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipate his dumpiſh and ſullen humors, make him briſk and ſociable, adap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate him to love and kind heartedneſs, and therefore <hi>Alcidruinus</hi> prudently
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56873:10"/>
appointed ſuch meetings, as a means to promote peace, procure hoſpita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and good Neighbourhood, beget friendſhip and alliance among the people, and prevent many mutinous diſcontents which retired and ſullen thoughts might hatch in their work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brains.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, but every man was not permitted to breed his ſon to Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, only ſuch as were tolerated and approved of by Magiſtrates appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for that purpoſe: As to other Profeſſions there was no ſuch reſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but in this, it was thought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to prevent ſome inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences which the unwarineſs of former times had procured; as the peſtering the Nation with inſufficient Parſons, and the exceſſive number of Scholars, which had been found injurious to the publick.

The Furniture competently rich and ſuitable to the quality of his perſon; the Rules of Expence agreeable to his Eſtate, the <hi>Oeconomy</hi> grave and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; all things managed with order and decency.</p>
            <p>His Mother was <hi>Timoclea,</hi> a Lady of an ancient and religious Family not far diſtant, who being dignified with a brave cleer ſpirit, allayed with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Modeſty, a ſound Judgment, ſublime Vertue, and incomparable grace in her expreſſions, was highly valued by all that knew her. Nor did ſhe want thoſe exteriour Ornaments which might partly commend her to <hi>Charinus</hi>'s choice: a rare beauty and becoming preſence; her complexion was exactly and equally compoſed of White and Red; her Viſage round, a light brown hair, with a cleer Eye,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56873:12"/>
but fixt and ſteady. Although in this important affair of Marriage, (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he knew there was no redreſs to be procured by ſecond thoughts; nor can a man erre twice as to the ſame adventure) I preſume he uſed much circumſpection, and prudently made virtue and Wiſdom his principal aim, as being aſſured theſe would highly conduce to his own particular content, the repute of his Family, the ſupport of his Eſtate, and (as far as humane prudence can ſecure men in ſuch a matter) entail Wiſdom and Vertue upon his Poſterity; yet to ſay beauty had no ſhare in his deſires, were to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent him either better or worſe than Man: eſpecially if we conſider the time when he was affianced to <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clea,</hi> which was about thirty years of age, <hi>Timoclea</hi> not much leſs than eighteen.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Charinus</hi> (to give a brief, but true Character of him) was a perſon truly Religious, conſtant and reſolute in the defence of the ſubſtantial principles of Religion, wherein all men (at leaſt the wiſeſt) were obſerved to agree; but lived altogether unconcerned in
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56873:13"/>
thoſe vain and nice controverſies, toy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh and <hi>Phanatick</hi> Opinions, which were now and then deviſed by ſome buſie and pragmatical brains, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to the giddy multitude; whoſe cuſtom is to ſtare and admire at any thing that is new, ſoon love and ſoon diſlike: their indiſcretion (as ill as it is, yet) herein proves lucky; their beloved novelties, like Childrens Rattles, never pleaſe long; that Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion which at one time is ſo fiercely aſſerted, that ſome would (only not) ſuffer Martyrdom, rather than diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vow it, perhaps continues not in cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit one mans age, and Poſterity will ſcarce vouchſafe to enquire after it. In the mean time a pious and truly-zealous man beſtows himſelf in belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in, and ſerving God, lives peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably and deals juſtly with all men, wherein the ſum of true Religion is comprized, while unquiet ſpirits are miſerably intangled in ſuch endleſs controverſies, as are of no importance to premote Religion, but very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to the peace and charitable converſation of men. It is not impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, but that the moſt pious and wiſe
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56873:13"/>
may, even in matters of Religion, have ſome fond erroneous and impertinent thoughts, ſuch as are uſually produced in a ſcattered and uncollected mind; but they are ſo far Maſters of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as to reſtrain them; they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them not to arrive at any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable growth: whereas men of ſmal knowledge, but great confidence, not onely give way to abſurd Opinions, but (as men in ſome peſtilent diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers are obſerved to do) eagerly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to propagate their contagion to the great diſturbance of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Charinus</hi> in his geſture and deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment obſerved a becomming gravity, his garb decent, his countenance ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and ſerious, not over ſad and lowring, nor petulant and effeminate; the one uſually paſſes for a token of ſelf-conceit, the other of ſmall wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. His addreſſes as free from af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected Complements, as rude blunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; neither ſneakingly meal-mouth'd, nor over-bold: his diſcourſe was ever profitable and to the purpoſe, yet modeſt, and without any affectation of applauſe. A wiſe man's diſcourſe
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:56873:14"/>
is alwaies adorned with three remark-properties, Truth, Conciſeneſs, and perſpicuity. Lies and ſlanders are Vices incident to ignorant, peeviſh, and cowardly perſons, who like que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulous Curs make a noiſe at a diſtance, inſult over the abſent, and at hand pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to lick them whole by ſome faint commendation, or ſhew of pity, mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing worſt when they ſpeak faireſt. Multitude of words was ever ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as an inſtance of ſmall wiſedom; ſome that have but a ſcant ſtock of knowledge endeavour to dilate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by multiplicity of words, as thoſe that have ſhrimpiſh bodies and yet would fain appear proper men, eke them out by ſome advantagious dreſs. He that puts men to the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of gueſſing and his meaning, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſpeaks as if he meant not to be underſtood, or intended to be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, is not in this particular a wiſe man, but either a fool, or as ill.</p>
            <p>However his actions and deſigns were Heroick and Noble, they were managed without any glorious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, and his demeanour in the mean time humble: he never ſpread
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:56873:14"/>
his ſails to receive the gales of popular air, which ſwell ſome men into a ſtrain of pride, and make them as big in their own conceits as they are in the eyes of the Vulgar. His beloved de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign was to acquire Vertue, which is ſufficient of its ſelf to ennoble a man among the wiſeſt and moſt intelligent part of men. Glory is a ſhadow that follows him who declines it, flees from him that purſues it, and a wiſe mans minde carries the ſame relation to it that the body doth to the ſhaddow, retains its dimenſion; is not extended into a greater, or cramp'd into a leſſer compaſs, according to the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous alteration of the ſhaddow.</p>
            <p>That he was generally well-beloved you will preſently gueſs, when I have told you that he was free from pride and envy: an humble and curteous man is the World's Darling, whiles a proud man, one meerly enamoured of himſelf, hath commonly the luck to be troubled with few Rivals: and that he was free from theſe appeared by his liberal bearing witneſs to other mens merits; they that have this piece of Ingenuity you may be ſure they
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56873:15"/>
are furniſhed with true worth of their own. Some choice and peculiar Friends and Privadoes he had, whoſe converſation and counſel he found uſeful in many emergencies, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in matters of counſel and advice, when one hath occaſion to adventure upon ſome deſign not uſuall and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary to him, in ſuch caſes a man's underſtanding is wonderfully enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and his Reſolutions quietly ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the concurrence of other mens counſel: for, though every intelligent man is beſt able to take the dimenſion of himſelf, and no wiſe man will make himſelf a Slave to the dictates of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; yet becauſe the Rules which our own thoughts ſuggeſt to us in ſudden encounters are commonly troubled, it is not amiſs to make the lives of other men our Looking-glaſs, the reſults of whoſe adventures in matters of like nature may much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten us, and their counſels guide us; two eyes ſee more that one, and he that will always be his own Tutor hath a fool to his Scholar.</p>
            <p>Whatſoever was commendable in his friends or occaſional Companions,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:56873:15"/>
he was ſtudious to imitate: what was amiſs, (provided it were not impious) he was willing to bear with for quiets ſake; if he diſcovered any impiety, or pernicious error, he forbare not to admoniſh them of it, avoiding always reproachful language, the uſual ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient of ſome mens reprehenſions, who endeavour not ſo much to amend o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as by vexing them to gratifie their own humor. His friendſhip was therefore permanent, becauſe well grounded; for in the choice of friends he principally ſet his thoughts on men that were of known integrity, and his equals. True Friends ſhould reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the fixed ſtars, alwayes at a like diſtance; Inferiors with Superiors are upon terms of diſadvantage, one is loath to ſtoop, the other cannot riſe.</p>
            <p>If frailty or inadvertency had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed him into an error, he thought it no ſhame to acknowledge it; it's a piece of humane frailty to err, but very unmanly to perſiſt in an error. If ſlanders and cloſe cavillations (wherewith cowardly and degenerate perſons uſually endeavour to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:56873:16"/>
the reputation of the braveſt men) were at any time raiſed againſt him, he neither troubled the quiet ſtate of his mind by a childiſh impatience, nor betrayd his innocence by a cowardly ſilence. He alwayes laboured to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure his Reputation with men of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved worth and integrity; for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, by a prudent neglect he permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to weary themſelves with an imaginary conceit of ſubverting his fame, till ſeeing their error (which they would ſoon do, when they found their Adverſary careleſs) they learn'd at length to be wiſe and ſilent.</p>
            <p>As for pleaſures, if conſiſtent with reaſon, they were ſometimes admited into his Entertainment as things that give an agreeable reliſh to vertuous actions: there's no man to be found of ſo warrented a conſtancy, that can purely for the love of Vertue perſiſt in well-doing; the pleaſure and content that reſults from thence hath a great energy to ſecure our perſeverance. Vertuous actions, though in the mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of them they be attended with ſome harſhneſs, yet they end in a moſt
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:56873:16"/>
ſincere and indiſturbed content: but the moſt exact pleaſures without this have a loathing and faſtidious nauſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting immediately ſubſequent. Thoſe Objects that have moſt ſharp and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible impulſions upon our ſenſes at the firſt, which arreſt, and violently captivate our reaſon, and make us ſo pertinaciouſly intent upon the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of them, terminate in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain: their ſatiety begets an hatred in us. The moſt glorious colours and pleaſant pictures recommend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to us under the notion of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty, we cannot endure to be conſtant ſpectators of them. The moſt raviſhing Notes of Muſick at laſt prove tedious. The Taſt, the moſt voluptuous of all the Senſes, is affected with ſweet things, and theſe ſooneſt offend it. Indolency and freedom from pain is the greateſt pleaſure men ordinarily acquire; that active impulſion where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they find themſelves affected in ſome ſenſual pleaſures, is a kind of reſtleſneſs, a pain which they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to expel or allay, that ſo they may be at eaſe. So that a wiſe man receives more content by not deſiring,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:56873:17"/>
than any can do in the fruition of them, and placing his happineſs in that which is permanent, piety and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; he is ſure to avoid that grand infelicity, which is to have been happy.</p>
            <p>If we look upon <hi>Charinus</hi> in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his Diet, we find him a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Obſerver of temperance, a ſure Pillar to preſerve and ſupport the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick of the body; but he never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaved and confined himſelf to any preciſe and fantaſtical Diet, which ſome men affecting more out of oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation than reaſon, make their bodies unapt for ſuch mutations and digreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, as one muſt of neceſſity encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter withal. He never uſed to eat till his ſtomach craved, conſulting rather to relieve the neceſſities of Nature, than indulge voluptuouſneſs. At his meals although he was not a nice Obſerver of order, yet uſually he eat moiſt and laxative meats in the firſt place, more firm and ſolid afterwards: nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments extream hot and of a biting quality (which without great caution devour the ſpirits) he uſually avoided. At great banquets which are frequent
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:56873:17"/>
among the people of that countrey, and thoſe ſet forth with great variety of diſhes; he uſually conſidered what was agreeable to his conſtitution, and the rules of temperance, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites a man to denie his own deſires, and fortifie himſelf againſt the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of affections, rather than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with the cuſtom of the people, who being generally Lovers of good cheer, think themſelves at their mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings obliged to ſome kind of exceſs, upon pain of being accounted uncivil. Hereupon he ſo ordered the matter, that by pleaſant diſcourſe, and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable table-talk, his company was ever acceptable, and redeemed him both from Intemperance, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of incivility or ſingula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p>He uſed moderate Exerciſe, which very much conduced to the clearing of his ſpirits, and maintaining the healthful conſtitution of his body, by diſcuſſing ſuch noughty humours as ſedentarineſs cauſeth to reſide in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>active bodies. Thoſe wherein he principally delighted were walking, riding, leaping, and ſhooting with the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:56873:18"/>
long-bow, in which the <hi>Alycians</hi> were generally expert. If happily he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times deviated from theſe good Rules of health, and contracted any diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, he uſed abſtinence and reſt in the firſt aſſault of it; Reaſon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed him, that Nature had then enough to do to wraſtle with the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croaching diſeaſe, and could neither ſo vigorouſly labour about concoction, nor aſſiſt him in accuſtomed exerciſes, which at ſuch a time would exhauſt the ſpirits and enfeeble the body.</p>
            <p>He was look'd upon as a thriving man, one that encreaſed his Eſtate; but ſtill by honeſt ſincere and generous courſes; he knew well enough that Goods ill gotten ſoon decay; Iron breeds its own Conſumption, ruſt; Braſs ingenders its Canker, and Wood corroding Worms, which without any outward violence, or impreſſion, cauſe them to decay: and Goods ſcraped up by ſacriledge, robbery, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, though ſome endeavour not to believe it, conſume away no body knowes how, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the provident care, indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, and penurious ſparing of the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:56873:18"/>
pretended profeſſors. In all times, and among all Nations honeſty hath been attended with a Bleſſing, either of proſperous adventure, or ſome coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervailing content. Villainy and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice have been made exemplary by ſome remarkable vengeance, and ſooner or later come to ruine.</p>
            <p>His eſtate though plentifull did not tranſport him beyond the bounds of aequanimity; ordinary calamities he alwayes entertained with a generous and ſedate ſpirit, proſperous adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures with a gratefull recognition of divine providence; nor did it raiſe him to ſo fond a conceit as to eſteem himſelfe above the cognizance of Lawes and Juſtice; if therefore he had occaſioned or procured any inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and treſpaſs to his neighbours, (which at one time or other will hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen among ſuch as have any dealings in the World) he willingly afforded them ſuch recompence as was equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent to the wrong ſuſtained, and the ſame dealings he accepted of from others if occaſion were offered. By this means he avoided all peeviſh quarrels and tedious Law-ſuits, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:56873:19"/>
the people of thoſe parts were exceedingly addicted, inſomuch that many times for a very ſmall matter they would eagerly purſue theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, till one or both of them were reduced to beggery.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Charinus,</hi> though derived from a noble ſtock, whoſe many branches for a long tract of time had been renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for valour and wiſdom, was never obſerved to boaſt of his Pedegree, as ſome will do with a ſupercilious often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; he eſteemed that only to be true Nobility which proceeded from a mans own worthy actions. It ſeem'd to him a matter of ſmall commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (as he was often heard to ſay) for one to boaſt of a fair Coat of Arms, and to relate how his great Grandfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther acquitted himſelf valiantly in ſuch a battel, when himſelf is of a cowardly and ignoble ſpirit, not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturing upon any brave act for the renown and protection of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. No leſs folly he eſteemed it for another to relate how his Progenitors were wiſe Stateſ-men, ſerved their Prince and Countrey with much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and ſincerity, who hath nothing
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:56873:19"/>
to diſtinguiſh him from the ordinary ſort of men, but an imperious dialect and fantaſtical garb, or ſome ſkill in hawking and hunting, things very commendable nevertheleſs when they are not the All of a man: with as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle credit doth another boaſt of great Mannors, and ample Poſſeſſions which his Anceſtors purchaſed, if he conſume them in pleaſures and riot: ſuch men, like Cyphers in books of accompt, are nothing of themſelves, but derive their value from ſome figure going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>To ſpeak what is right concerning theſe exterior appendages; Nobility, Wealth, Honour, ancient Families, great Relations, they are like rich Drapery in a Picture, which is an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament to an handſom Countenance, an ugly viſage deforms it: they add Confidence and Reſolution to a man, whereas Poverty duls the courage, fruſtrates many a noble deſign, and proves a clog to ingenious mindes. They acquire obſervance, authority, and reſpect, while Poverty renders men contemptible. The Vulgar pay reſpect to a man, not for his Wiſdom,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:56873:20"/>
(which they cannot judge of) but according to the rate of his outward Luſtre and Magnificence. Theſe, or the like conſiderations ſo inflamed the generous minde of <hi>Charinus,</hi> that he thought himſelf peculiarly obliged ſo to acquit himſelf, that his Family and his Eſtate ſhould not be ſo great Ornaments to him, as he to them.</p>
            <p>He never was ambitious in ſeeking after great places, to ſay the truth he did not affect them; wiſely conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that men of high aims, mounting to the top of honour are like ſuch as ſtand upon a <hi>Precipice</hi> with the Sun in their faces, the dangerouſneſs of their ſtation and ſplendor of their greatneſs conſpire together to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw them. Yet his known wiſdom and Integrity had ſo deſervedly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended him to <hi>Alcidruinus,</hi> that he alwaies had a ſpecial reſpect to him, and uſed him in the managing of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny conſiderable affairs. So that he did not like that auſtere and ſullen Roman,<note place="margin">Cato apud Mart. lib. <hi>1.</hi> Epig. <hi>3.</hi> Senec. Ep. <hi>97.</hi>
               </note> only come into the Theatre and ſo go out again, paſs away his time without any remarkable exploits, his whole life was a ſeries and reitera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:56873:20"/>
of famous and worthy Actions, (too many to be related here, and too good to be defaced by an imperfect and overbrief recital, therefore whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly omitted) which made him gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally beloved in his life, and honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble after his death.</p>
            <p>But as the moſt exquiſite beauty may have a mole, and the moſt exact piece of limning an overdeep ſhadow, whereof one may ſeem to diſparage Nature, and the other Art; both ſerve but as a foil to ſet off the other parts with the greater luſtre: ſo the moſt abſolute and exact man is not without his paſſions and diſtempers. It's poſſible to frame an <hi>Idea</hi> of an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute happy Common-wealth, mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with ſuch decency, ſuch an even diſtribution, that every man ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive full content, and none be ever annoyed with the leaſt grievance: To ſet forth the pattern of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Prince, ſuch a one as ſhould give full content and ſatisfaction to all his Subjects; to contrive the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del of an exact man, of a golden temper, an unwearied champion in the liſts of Virtue and honour: Art
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:56873:21"/>
will preſcribe a platform for all theſe, give punctuall rules how they may be atchieved, becauſe it conſiders the deſign its ſelf apart from all <hi>remora</hi>'s, but he that attempts to put theſe in practice, ſhall finde his endeavours check'd and controlled by variety of paſſions and diſtempers, divers inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening circumſtances of perſons, times, and places, the ſtrange obliquity of mens manners, the unobſerved con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingency of humane things commonly called Fortune, (which is ever obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to raiſe ſome countermine againſt the beſt endeavours) theſe all, or ſome of them interpoſing in his way, cannot but interrupt his proceeding, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inherit him of his expectation. It is honour enough for a wiſe man that he never loſes all, but couragiouſly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing himſelf againſt theſe Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, arrives at ſo much perfection as is attainable by humane induſtry. While I have briefly recorded the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of renowned <hi>Charinus,</hi> nothing hath been ſaid concerning his paſſions, and vitious inclinations: I mean not to abuſe the Reader into a belief that he was free from theſe; certainly he
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:56873:21"/>
was free from theſe, certainly he was not unconcerned in the ordinary fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and miſcariages of men, but have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing omitted the particular recitation of his beſt actions, it were unhand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to goe about to gratifie you with a relation of his worſt: I ſhall therefore omit them; and, as a more lovely and uſeful advertiſement, tell you by what meanes he reſcued himſelf from the tyranny of diſorde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red paſſions, and though I cannot ſay they were ſo forcible as totally to ſubdue them, yet they preſerved him from being ſubdued by them.</p>
            <p>It will be eaſily granted that the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineſt preſervative againſt vice is not to be acquainted with it, not ſo much as know the very name of it too ſoon, to have the mind habituated to piety in the youth, which <hi>Charinus</hi>'s was; and beſides, being of a brave &amp; couragious ſpirit (and ſuch are generally moſt free from baſe vices) he conſidered the dignity and prerogative of his ſoul, which he ſcorned to debaſe by putting it under the wardſhip of uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping vices. Without doubt a ſerious and ſolid conſideration of our ſelves,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:56873:22"/>
as it would elevate our thoughts to a due contemplation of our Maker, the main end of our being, ſo would it intice the mind to much reſolution i<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> vertuous actions, and retract our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires from purſuing ſuch trivial de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, as reſult from things inferior to our natures; but this muſt not be an idle and careleſſe meditation, ſuch as men ordinarily entertain, when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving ſome ſublime dictates of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſuggeſted to them by their own thoughts, or the writings or diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of learned men, they write them in the ſand; give them a ſhort ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe in their thoughts: whereas if they were entertained with ſerious reſolutions to act according to them, they might leave a deep impreſſion upon their judgement and will, and by practice become as it were natural to them, were the mind ſo induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as to improve them to their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt extent and latitude. Beſides this, a ſerious converſe with our ſelves would contribute no ſmall aſſiſtance to the diſcovery of real and ſolid truth, refined from the ſuperfluities of ſo many diſtinctions, formalities,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:56873:22"/>
and nice criticiſmes, as rather obſcure than illuſtrate it. We need not ſuffer our thoughts to range into ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancies as uſually we do, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in ſuch ſciences as may be digeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into axioms and aphoriſms, a few clear principles naturally deduced from reaſon, would ſtate our mindes in the handling and managing of them; without that multitude of curious queſtions and vain niceties, which like to brambles, intricately perplex us, but afford no fruit.

In the next place we muſt take notice that he was not indulgent to (or ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mored of) his own paſſions, but deſired and reſolved to ſubdue them; without
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:56873:23"/>
a prejudice againſt them all faint in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours are ineffectual. He avoided the company of ſuch men as were ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to thoſe paſſions: he attempted to ſubdue, and abſtracted himſelf from the interview of provoking objects. Objects that tempt &amp; incite our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons reſemble an eccho, the further one drawes himſelfe from them, the leſſe repercuſſion they make. If we expoſe them to our view, and behold them with content, the reflection which the preſent object darts, as it were, upon us inſnares our mind preſently, but vaniſheth and loſeth its ſelf by a little abſence, and though at firſt to abſent our ſelves from a beloved object, be a perplexing torment, if we have but patience and reſolve to endure, the time will come when it will be a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
            <p>To prevent anger, he was alwaies cautelous leſt he ſhould by any means make other men his enemies, he would not willingly diſoblige the meaneſt perſon leſt he ſhould provoke them to offer indignities, and ſo he might be provoked to revenge: he alſo avoided much earneſt buſineſſe, and exceſſive
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:56873:23"/>
ſtudy, wherein if one be interrupted, that uſually procureth ſome vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; curioſity alſo and coſtly things, the one as it may now and then find out ſomewhat that pleaſes, ſo it often encounters with diſcontents, the loſſe of the other ordinarily procures vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. If he were at any time ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by this churliſh paſſion, he did not undertake of a ſudden totally to ſuppreſſe it, but by degrees averted his thoughts from that which diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him, till time gently allaid the commotion which was raiſed in the blood and ſpirits.</p>
            <p>Drunkenneſſe (the bane of many a man of great parts and prodigious wits) which as they have an advantage for the attainment of vertue, ſo are they inclined to the greateſt vices, he avoided by ſometimes changing his ſeat, binding himſelf by a ſolemn vow and reſolution for a ſhort time at firſt, and afterwards for a longer, ſetting himſelfe to perform ſome task, and till that were finiſhed, reſolved upon a retired courſe: by theſe honeſt cheats he defrauded his appetite of that bewitching thing called compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny-keeping,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:56873:24"/>
and for his paines found a moſt ſincere pleaſure in abſtinence, to the utter diſparagement of volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſneſſe.</p>
            <p>There is a reſtleſſe and lingring paſſion called love, I never heard he was ſurprized (at leaſt not baffled) by it, but to ſuch as were, he princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally diſſwaded them from ſolitude and recluſeneſſe, which cauſe ones thoughts to be pertinaciouſly fixt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that he loves; adviſed them to frequent and viſit their friends, and be ſure to impart their thoughts, and open their diſtemper to ſome prudent and diſcreet perſon, whoſe counſel and perſwaſion they ſhould find mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellouſly efficatious in ſuch an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <p>Sadneſſe, Melencholy, and dejecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſpirit are very incident to ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and ingenious men, who at the emergency of croſſe accidents more earneſtly ruminate upon their ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, uſe a kind of skill in tormenting themſelves, and though company, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment and ſuch divertiſments may ſomewhat allay the diſtemper for a time, yet their minds are very
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:56873:24"/>
acute in retriving their grievances, and amplifying their ſorrowes by a tedious and irkſome remembrance. To ſuch men he recommended (what he had with good ſucceſs experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,) ſuch directions as theſe, to avoid ſolitarineſſe, vigorouſly to ſnatch their thoughts from that which trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled them, and fix them upon ſome other thing, never to let their thoughts be too cloſly confined, but as it were ſcattered and at liberty, by which means they would not receive ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable annoyance: if their calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty were the product of their own er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour or wickedneſſe, no remedy (he told them) but repentance, and a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry reſolution againſt the like miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage for the future; if it proceeded from poverty, exile, loſſe of freedom, and the like, whereunto they were not conſcious that any remarkable miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage of their own contributed oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion; he conceived it expedient for them to put off their preſent grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, with the hope of better adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, though hope it ſelfe be but a kind of pain, yet it's more gentle than deſpair. It is not impoſſible for a
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:56873:25"/>
man ſo to model and order his will, that it ſhall buckle and comply with any condition, the will can of its ſelf act either way, will, or refuſe; chuſe, or reject; without the impulſion of exterior objects. A man (if he will labour about it) may curb his appetite with a repetition of paſt delights, or antedate and foreſtal future pleaſures and what felicity his condition de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, frame it for himſelf. It's confeſt, this may ſeem but a pittiful ſhift, to be put off with an immaginary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, a feigned and ſuppoſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, yet it may ſerve to avocate the minde at the preſent from worſe meditations, and prevent deſpair. He that will take the pains to obſerve, may find that the mind is ſometimes willing to deceive its ſelf, by framing a falſe and fantaſtical ſubject, though againſt its own conceit, rather than not be buſy at all.

I fore-ſee the Reader will ſmile at this narrative of <hi>Charinus</hi>'s imaginary and conceited happineſſe, I have told him it is ſo; but in good earneſt joy and ſorrow are but artificial devices, and atchei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable by induſtry, they are the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts of our will; it is not proſperity alone can make men joyful, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py; but a confidence to believe that they are ſo. Nor can adverſity alone make a man miſerable; miſery its ſelf is no miſery, but a man imagins it to
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:56873:26"/>
be ſo. There's neither infelicity no felicity in things, but only as we entertain them with a miſguided or rectified opinion. But beſides this Stoical reſoluteneſſe, let a man in adverſity, aſſure himſelf of the undoubted good ſucceſſe which will at laſt reſult from honeſt indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, and further conſider that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity tries him as the furnace tries mettals, not to conſune but refine and clear. It makes men look into themſelves, puts them upon action, unfolds many clandeſtine diſtempers, which in a firme and ſetled condition lurked and were not noted, like tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtuous weather it clears and purges the aire, and as the Sun is moſt wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, after it hath broke through the clouds and miſts that ſmothered his beauty from the world, ſo is that joy moſt welcom, which ſucceeds a tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous infelicity. And the recollection of ſorrowes amplifies the preſent joy; nothing is here permanent, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly particular men, but families, Cities and Countries have their viciſſitudes and returns of proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and adverſity, ſickneſſe and

            <p>Joy is that which every one ſeeks and aims at, and thinks he can never have too much of it, yet at ſome times there is need of more prudence in the managing of it than men conjecture; for, if it be exceſſive and ſudden, it tranſports a man beyond himſelf; a man is rather oppreſſed than relieved by a ſudden encounter of felicity, as the fire is often extinguiſhed for want of fewell, ſo is it ſtifled and choaked by too much; the heart is not onely oppreſſed by grief when the bloud and ſpirits are chill and ſtagnant, and flow not freely to it, but alſo by the impetuous agitations of joy, when they flow with ſuch violence, that the heart is not able to tranſmit them ſo faſt into the Arteries, ſo that they choak and damp its natural heat, which they would preſerve if they flowed in a convenient quantity. In ſuch a caſe as this, he found it condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible to meditate on the inconſtancy of humane felicity, and that Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity may ſuddenly happen; to ſkir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh

There is hardly a man to be found ſo wretched, but his condition may adminiſter ſome matter of content: and that of his ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours is not ſo abſolute, as to be excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from all inconveniencies; the ſcale of Providence ſtands at a more even counter-poiſe than the querulous World would ſet it; we cannot be all Great, Honour is diſtributed to one, Riches to another, Wiſdome to another: to ſome all theſe, and to others none at all; who yet in reſpect of their ſecure ſedate, and peaceable condition, may be happier than the greateſt; the ſkill is to know their own good, and not other mens ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitively.</p>

The moſt brave and generous way to curb
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:56873:28"/>
them all, is a noble reſolution not to yeild to them: but for a man to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer himſelf, deny his own deſires in deſpight of contrary inclinations, to fortifie his minde againſt all the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of Pleaſure, Profit, Honor, Self-conceit, that would almoſt force his conſent, and extort a compliance. If this ſeem too difficult to be done on a ſudden, all at once; a man may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh it by degrees, binde him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by a reſolution to avoid all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions for a ſhort time at firſt, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward for a longer ſpace. By cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome bruit beaſts are many times taught to forget their natural incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations; by cuſtom the hardeſt things become eaſie: A Spaniel by nature is carried on with an eager and furious purſuit after a Partridge, and queſts at the ſpringing of it; yet is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily taught to diſobey this forcible command of nature, and to couch quietly down at the finding of it. What a tedious thing is it for a Childe at firſt to frame a Letter? to manage the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Flouriſhes, curſory and intricate knots in writing? or for a man to bring his tough and ſtiff fingers to
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:56873:29"/>
bend and reach the Stops or Frets in a Lute? which by practice cloſe in with them of their own accord: the repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of the action produces a facility in working, renders it familiar to the Organs, imprints an habit, a kinde of remembrance (as ſome call it) in the hand, without our perception or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation. It's true, we have a deſign for the principal Action, writing, or playing on the Inſtrument; the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſtrokes and touches are managed oft-times, we not adverting them, yet regularly and with certainty, becauſe the imagination readily moves and directs the Organs. Nor is it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in the exerciſes of the Minde, in the actions of Vertue; the entrance preſents ſome difficulty, uſe will make them eaſie: It will be worth our pains to perſevere in them, for where en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours bring advantage, it's a brave refreſhment to have been wearied.</p>

(and did himſelf improve) others in matter of Learning; ſo was he very ſerviceable to his Country through his Dexterity, in managing thoſe Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments in which he was conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant. Some very knowing and able men for want of Imployment, ſink in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to themſelves, converſe meerly with their own Thoughts, either their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>harmony with the humour of the Times they live in, multitudes of men of the ſame profeſſion; Poverty, (the uſual clog to brave Actions) or their over-much modeſty, (the uſual pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of a wiſe man) retard their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, and afford them not any Stage to act upon. But no ſuch Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles were offered to <hi>Charinus</hi>'s Proceedings, for beſides that he lived in peaceable Times, the civil Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions being ſedated; and under a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious and prudent Prince: he alſo wanted not Wealth, Opportunities, Materials, wherewith to maintain his Enterpriſes: and without which, no man (though of an unhappy Wit and Ingenuity) can raiſe himſelf up to any conſiderable eſteem.</p>
            <p>In his old Age he was not moroſe
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:56873:31"/>
and untractable, but commonly quiet and cheerful; his care was to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to future Ages a Pattern worthy of imitation: he was pious himſelf. and earneſtly invited others to be ſo. Piety reſembles the fire, which not only hath heat in itsſelf, but a power and inclination alſo to communicate heat to other Bodies: the efficacy of his Piety, and pious Inſtructions, were evidently ſeen in <hi>Eriander,</hi> as ſhall be ſhewed, who lived <hi>Charinus</hi>'s life o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver again, and made the World to ſee that his Vertues were not dead, but tranſplanted: good Counſel operates on a reſolved Minde, as the Light on a cloſe compacted Body, which by u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niting and reflecting the viſive Rayes becomes luminous; whereas ſlight and thin bodies (wherein the rayes are abſorpt and loſe themſelves) ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or tranſmit them, ſo as they evade the eye, or become obſcure.</p>
            <p>He died in the ſixty third year of his Age, which is the great Climacte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical year, reſulting from the multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Seven, and Nine; for where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as every ſeventh and nineth year, men ſuſtain ſome remarkable alteration in
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:56873:32"/>
their bodies, either through the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion and agitation of Humours, which in ſuch a period of time gain a conſiderable augmentation; or from the peculiar influence of the Planets, eſpecially <hi>Saturn,</hi> which every ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth year is ſaid to exerciſe domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on over mens bodies: So eſpecially when theſe Climacterical years con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur, the effects do more powerfully diſcover themſelves, that he died in much tranquility and quietneſs of minde, is without all diſpute: having ſecured himſelf of that only content and peace of minde which this world affords, that is, the content which flows from doing good; and alſo by his Piety foreſtalled Eternity, and gained ſuch an aſſurance (as is here attainable) of that Happineſs which is compleat hereafter. That his death was lamented, and his Name renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after death; though I ſhould not relate it, every man may therein be his own Intelligencer: for it is very well known, that he who lives piouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, cannot but die honourably: whilſt a man lives, Flattery may over-much enhaunce, or Envy may debate the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:56873:32"/>
rate of his Worth, but after death theſe are ſilent; and Poſterity (which is leaſt concerned in mens actions) is willing to do right to Illuſtrious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, whoſe Vertues are ever moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſplendent after their Funerals.</p>
            <p>The Eſtate deſcended to <hi>Eriander</hi> according to the Laws of the Nation, but a plentiful proviſion was made for a Daughter which he left, as alſo for <hi>Timoclea,</hi> of whom I cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſo large and exact a Character, as her Merits call for, but am forced to tranſcribe the Painters way, who being to draw a vaſt Gyant in a ſmall Table, preſented only one of his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, whereby the Spectators might gueſs at the proportion of his body. This may not be omitted, That ſhe was a Lady ſincere in her Devotions, charitable in her Actions, peaceable in her Carriage, and temperate in her Diet; a loving and loyal Wife, a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable Neighbour, and a prudent Governeſs in her Family. It was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that while <hi>Charinus</hi> and ſhe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved together in a Conjugal ſtate, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and moderate Gravity hath ſuch influence upon all that were related
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:56873:33"/>
to them, as domeſtick Servants; that they were ſufficiently inſtructed as in the diſcreet and frugal ordering of buſineſs, ſo in piety and ſober demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure. They alwaies made choice of ſuch Retirements as were free from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Vices, eſpecially Riot, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſention, and Idleneſs, the diſgrace and ruine of a Family: of ſuch as were honeſt and ſparing; ſuch as took de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in Frugallity, not to ſay penu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious; preſuming that theſe would be provident and careful in their truſt. If happily they had entertained ſuch as were otherwiſe, they laboured to make them ſo; to which purpoſe they treated them ſo indifferently with mildeneſs and ſeverity, and the one ſhould not make them deſperate, nor the other remiſs: above all, their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample hath ſuch powerful influence upon them, as they accounted it a ſhame not to be good, having ſuch precedents. Neither did <hi>Charinus</hi> or <hi>Timoclea</hi> ſo look upon their conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Servitude, as to forget their condition of Nature; the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the firſt cauſed them to keep them ſtrictly to convenient Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:56873:33"/>
and the latter to be tender of their Welfare, and afford them ſuch reſpect and accommodations, as are due to people of their condition.</p>
            <p>And now it is time to come to <hi>Eri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> the ſubject of this Hiſtory; from which a great part of the former Narrative may ſeem to have been a digreſſion, which yet I conceive hath not been impertinent, conſidering of what importance it is to the compleat inſtitution of a man, that he be born in a Country where commendable Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is obſerved, under the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a noble Prince, and of pious and worthy Parents. And that I may here prepare an Apology for ſomwhat that ſhall immediatly enſue, I hope the Laws of Method will allow me to proceed as neer as I can from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant of his Conception, which was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Month of <hi>May,</hi> (for he was born in <hi>February</hi>) which Seaſon Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſeems to deſign more peculiarly for the production of Creatures. To the evidencing of this, we are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that as the perpetual dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and continuance of things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon (and is guided by the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:56873:34"/>
motion of the Sun from Eaſt to Weſt; ſo Generation and Corruption are promoted by the oblique courſes of the Sun and other heavenly bodies, through the Zodiack, which alter the affections and qualities of inferiour things, according to their ſcituation and Aſpects, the acceſs or receſs of their Rayes: when the Sun draws neer its vertical Point, and the Rayes are received by the Earth in more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and right Angles, it dilates and rarifies the Aire, recludes the pores of the Earth, draws out the Seeds of things into a greater latitude, ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons forth the lurking Spirits and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites the prolifical Vertue. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary is ſeen when the Earth admits its Sun-beams in oblique Angles, for then the Aire becomes cold, the ſuperficies and body of the Earth cloſe compact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; bodies are ſhrunk into a cloſer conſiſtency, and all active Faculties are more benummed: That heat doth agitate the parts, rarifie and dilate bodies that are capable of relaxion, appears by the Seeds of Plants caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Earth, as into their proper Womb, where having convenient moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:56873:34"/>
(for moiſture makes a body apt to receive the vigorous impreſſion of heat, and yeild it ſelf obedient to that deſign Nature is about to work upon it) Tumefy, break the outward Rinde, and diſcloſe with an Orifice; whereby the ſeminal Neb, or Bud, ſhoots its ſelf upward, and being by little and little dilated, it branched at length into a perfect Vegetable; and the heat ſtill ſublimes up moiſture through certain fibrous ſtrings, for the nouriſhing of every part. In that ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial device of making Malt, we ſee that Barley macerated with water to make it more capable of relaxation, and layd into a Couch, the ſuperfluity of water that would choak it, being removed, Nature preſently advances her ſelf to Generation, the parts by their contiguity gather heat, this heat dilates every ſeveral Grain, excites and puts in action the generative ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and labours after a production of more individuals: But the Artiſt, (who hath no further intention than only to excite and advance the ſpirits of his Malt) deludes Nature all this while, and to fruſtrate her intentions,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:56873:35"/>
turns and tumbles about the Barley, leſt having a fixt ſcituation, and being incloſed in a Congeries, (which might ſerve inſtead of a womb for Nature to work in) the whole pitch ſhould branch forth into a Plant, and at laſt by help of fire, he removes the moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture that might help to promote the generation. In the production of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, a concrete or coagulated juyce (which as a Seed of the metal is wrapt up in the womb of the earth) rarified and extended by a certain heat (ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inbred, or peradventure derived from the Sun, and darted through the Earths pores into the Mine) and when it is augmented by ſuperaddition of new matter, this heat concocts and converts it into the ſubſtance of ſuch a Mineral, whoſe form and eſſence it is apt to receive; and thus it is brought from its looſe principles, into a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect conſiſtency.</p>
            <p>In the generation of living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of all ſorts, Nature proceeds in ſuch a kinde of method, though with much more curioſity and ſtatelineſs: but as there, ſo here; ſhe requires three principal things: A Matter qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified

            <p>And now let the Reader allow him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a little leiſure to conſider upon how ſlender a foundation the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Fabrick of this little World is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected; from how pitiful (yet admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable) Original, the greateſt Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees of the World, (that ſwell ſo big in their own, and other mens eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) are extracted the wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it, rebates the ſharpneſs of all Eloquence, and puts it beyond the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of expreſſion: and this may partly be the cauſe of that vain care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs whereof we all have a ſpice; we ſeldome take the pains to look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our ſelves, nothing earneſtly affects us, but what comes under the notion of Novelty, Cuſtome and Familiarity with things blunts the edge of our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration: The intricate and curious contrivance of our own Bodies, is a work ſurpaſſing all the Mechanical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions in the world; yet either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are lazy and dull in our ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations,

            <p>The ſcope of this ſtory (as I have deſigned it,) obliges me to ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what concerning this ſubject, before I proceed any further; becauſe many things which are to follow cannot o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe be well underſtood by Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Readers, to the Learned I ſhall not need to write any thing concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Man, who are ordinarily no ſuch ſtrangers to themſelves.</p>
            <p>Man conſiſts of a Body and a Soul, an Inviſible part, and a Viſible; by the purity and energy of the Soul he is enabled to diſcern and know him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and things different from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: the groſs compoſure of the body renders him an object of Senſe; and both together make him ſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. So he fals under a three-fold conſideration, <hi>viz.</hi> that of the body
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:56873:38"/>
alone, the Soul alone, and both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The firſt is managed by Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers and Phyſicians; the ſecond by Divines and Philoſophers; and the third by Moraliſts, Divines, Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryans, &amp; Writers of policy; in whoſe elaborate writings may be found am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple diſcoveryes of what I ſhall only glance at.</p>
            <p>The body conſiſts of parts, either contayned, which being tenuious and fluid, are therefore bounded and kept in by ſuch as are more tough &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted, ſuch are all the humors of the body, Blood, Choler, Melancholy and Flegme with the ſpirits, which are nothing elſe but the purer part of the blood, as the other humors are the groſſe and ſedimentary part of it; ſo as the various humors in the body are no more but blood diverſifyed; or ſomewhat percolated from the blood as Urine, Sweat, Choler, Melancholy, and all ſeroſe humors. The parts contayning, which limit and confine others, are either ſimilar, of like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and compoſure, as fleſh, veins, nerves, arteries, and bones: or diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar, made up of other particles of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:56873:39"/>
a different nature, ſuch are the Brain, Heart, Liver, Lungs, Kidneys, Spleen, &amp;c. and all Muſcles: for in theſe there is a mixture of fleſh, Veins, Arteries, Blood, and ſpirits, (or thin agile par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles) according as the office of every member requires.</p>
            <p>The Soul as it reſides in the body, (for in that ſtate alone it ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered here,) exerciſes divers fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, as Vegetation, whereby the body lives, is nouriſhed and augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the ſpecies propagated by generation; to accompliſh which, the meat and drink we receive, being ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticated and reduced into ſmall parts in the mouth, is conveyed downe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſtomach, where a certain ſharp and hot humor piercing into it, redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces it into ſmaller parts, and makes it ſlippery; ſo that it may eaſily ſlide into the ſmall whitiſh veines, (called from their colour <hi>Lacteal,</hi>) theſe lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teal veins intercepting the pureſt and juicyeſt part of it, convey it into the hollow vein, in which paſſage it receives much tranſmutation; the excrementitious and leſſe uſeful parts (by vertue of certain glandulous ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:56873:39"/>
which make an attrition upon it, and ſever the pureſt part from the leſſe pure,) are conveyed to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per receptacles; For that which we call Choler is conveyed into a little bag called the Gall, hanging at the Liver; Urine is conveyed by the Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyes to the Bladder, the groſſer ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cremements ſlip through the entrals or Guts; That which paſſeth through the veins ſtaies not till it arrive at the heart; where it receives a more perfect concoction and purifying; and from the heart part of it is carried from the right Ventricle of the heart, (through a vein called the arterial vain,) to the Lungs; whence it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes through the venal Artery into the left Ventricle of the heart, thence with the reſt of the blood, (for ſo it is by this time) it flowes into a great Artery called by Anatomiſts <hi>Aorta.</hi> This Artery ſpreading it ſelf into ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny branches, diſtributs it to every part of the body, that it may nouriſh, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liven &amp; move every member. <hi>Teſticuli interim (neſi omiſſi, &amp; quaſi caſtrati, e noſtra microcroſmi hiſtoriola exulent) partem dicti alimenti allicientes, in</hi>

            <p>As all parts of our body partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate of this kind and active influence of the blood, ſo the Brain ſeemes to ingroſſe the pureſt portion of it, the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:56873:40"/>
thicker part cannot arrive there by reaſon of the narrow paſſages through which it is percolated; the Brain di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſts it into a thin ſubſtance called animal ſpirits, which are diſperſed in the nerves, contributing ſenſe and motion to the whole body. The moſt remarkable motion, and of moſt abſolute neceſſity, is reſpiration, and is thus accompliſhed; The animal ſpirits which take their way to the Muſcles of the Breſt through the nerves that are branched thither, move and dilate the great Muſcle called <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> which by conſequence extends the parts of the Breſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Lungs (which accomodate themſelves to the motion of the breſt) are alſo dilated, as a pair of bellowes; ſo is alſo the ſharp Artery, and the contagious aire (which is ready to fill any concave or fiſtular body that hath nothing elſe to fill it) is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded, one part rejecting the other, till that next to the mouth and Noſe enters; but after a little pauſe the Lungs contracting themſelves, when the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> is erected in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vex figure and preſſes upon them,

ſend it forth and inſtantly receive a new ſupply. This alternate motion is of manifold uſe, for the intromiſſion of cool and freſh aire, and it ſerves to refreſh the heart, Lungs, and Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, in caſe they be too hot: ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially it contributes to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of vital ſpirits, which parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate of an aiery nature, and may probaly ſomewhat aſſiſt the heart in that motion whereby it conveyes the blood into the Arteries, and in this reſpect is of abſolute neceſſity of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve life.</p>

But in ſpeaking there are more little engines ſet on work, the ſharp Artery alternately dilates &amp; contracts its ſelf, the larynx or upper part or lid of it intercepts, or gives free paſſage to the aire, the parts that conſtitute the orb of the mouth, the Tongue, Teeth, Palat, and Lips make various ſtops, daſhes and calliſions upon it, the various extention of the ſharp Artery contributes to the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſifying of our voice into ſhrill or low, acute or flat: for if the artery be much ſtreightned and compreſſed, the voice becomes flat; if freely dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, it proves accute; the larynx by its motion ſerves to make the ſtops or diſtances between our words, the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans of the mouth make it articulate and ſignificative. For as in a Pipe, the ſound extending its ſelf in a right line, would be uniform and of one tone, did not the artiſt intercept it,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:56873:42"/>
ſo would our breath cauſe an uniform and uſeleſſe noiſe, if it ſhould freely convey its ſelf in a direct progreſſe, but encountering the Mouthes cavity it is obliged to aſſume various figures, and conform its ſelf to the configura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the mouth. The five vowels <hi>a, e, i, o, u</hi> ſeem to be made only by the different emiſſion of the breath; and require not any obſerveable acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the parts of the mouth, but ſeem to be accompliſhed by the different extentions of the ſharp Artery; for as in a pipe ſo in our artery, the ſame proportion of aire may yeeld a vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſound, according as the paſſage is either widened or compreſſed, ſtill, or quavering; But the Conſonants are formed with more extant and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernably motion, when the Lips en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ſtop and intercept the aire in its paſſage, <hi>b</hi> and <hi>p</hi> are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; when the baſis of the tongue ſtrikes at the palate, <hi>c</hi> and <hi>g</hi> are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, when the point of the tongue ſtrikes at the teeth, and daſhes the emergent aire againſt them, you may hear the ſound of <hi>t</hi> and <hi>d</hi>; If the Lips be ſhut and the breath mount

upward toward the noſe, the letter <hi>m</hi> is framed; when the tongue ſtops the breath by clapping it ſelfe to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, this motion gives being to the letter <hi>n</hi>; If the breath ſo ſtopped makes an eſcape by the ſide of the Cheekes, then it appears in the ſound of <hi>l</hi>; ſomtimes the breath is as it were preſſed, either through the teeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and <hi>ſ</hi> is ſqueezed out, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the tongue or Palate, and thence <hi>r</hi> comes ſnarling forth: or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the tongue and fore-teeth, and ſo we pronounce <hi>z</hi> and <hi>jod.</hi> When a ſoft puffe is emitted between the fore-teeth &amp; lips almoſt compreſſed, if we be troubled with a deafneſs, yet we may ſee <hi>f</hi> and <hi>vau</hi> pronounced.

object, which if preſent, produceth Joy; if abſent, Hope. In averſion they contract and retire themſelves, and lurk in a kinde of fixation, upon the apprehenſion of a diſpleaſing Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, which, if it be preſent, cauſeth Grief; if abſent, Fear.</p>
            <p>But I am not yet arrived at that ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream faculty, whereby Man is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from Bruit beaſts; thoſe which have been hitherto recited, are moſt of them as eminent (ſome more exact) in them, than in Man: that they have life, motion, and ſenſe, the moſt ignorant are able to obſerve; that they have eſtimation of things appears by their choice of Meats, ſeeking of ſubterfuges, and cautelous avoiding of dangers. That they have a natural Dialect, or way of communicating and imparting their Deſigns, or Thoughts, one to another ſufficient for them, and proportionable to their neceſſities, is diſcovered by their various tones, actions, and geſtures, which they uſe according to the ſeveral occaſions they encounter with, their nutations and careſſes wherewith they ſalute one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother at their meeting. Their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:56873:45"/>
is diſcovered by their certain and ready finding out their uſual haunts, their ſtarting and ſhrinking from any thing wherein they have found inconvenience, and their impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous purſuing of that wherein they have found content. Their Phantaſie appears by their quick and lively ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions, their docility, their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaging of future events; their ſpeedy recourſe many times to ſuch remedies as have power to eaſe their diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers. How admirably is their Will guided, their appetite and averſion, by an ingenuous foreſight, in mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging their deſigns, their ſleights and ſubtilties, their regular choice of means to avoyd that which they fear? Though the ſtory of the Dog ſeems to have too much of the Fable in it, which to get the drink out of a deep pot caſt ſtones into it, till it advanced to the top: yet the ſtratagems of a Fox, which he uſes to ſurprize his prey, or contrive his eſcape, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable. Hiſtoryes and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience afford variety of Inſtances. To ſay that theſe acute contrivances and ſubtilties proceed from a natural In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:56873:46"/>
or an apiſh imitation of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, is to multiply words, which upon the matter ſignifie nothing. When the actions are of like nature, and the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans by which they are performed not at all different, the faculties ſurely are the ſame. But herein Beaſts do fall ſhort of Man, in that they cannot but reflect upon their own knowledge; they know not that they know a thing, they underſtand not the particular reaſons of things, ſo as from thence to deduce an univerſal concluſion. They have ſingle conceptions of things, as appears by their prompt and ready taking notice of them; they modifie, compound, and divide ſingle appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions, judge of them as pleaſant or diſtaſtful, which appears by their inclinations to, and averſions from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers objects, and that in the abſence of the objects, and when their ſenſes are obſtructed, as is evident by their dreams, in which they will by their alacrity expreſs their content; and their fear, by ſhivering and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling. Thus far they proceed in the contexture of Diſcourſe; but they give us no Inſtance of their ſkill in the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:56873:46"/>
laſt action, which is to draw conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences from antecedents, to argue from Cauſes to Effects, to proceed from ſignes to things ſignified. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though a Dog, in queſt of his game, or purſuit of his Maſter, ſeems to uſe a Logical trick, a kind of arguing, (and other beaſts ſeem to do the like upon ſeveral occaſions;) for, having ſcented firſt one way, then another, he ſeems to make two Negative Propoſitions concerning two Pathes, becauſe he findes not the Tract; and earneſtly purſues the third: which hath paſſed for a piece of <hi>Cynical</hi> Logick among ſome ſuperficial Wits; yet if we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert it well, in this Action, the Dog draws not any concluſion by regular diſcourſe, but purſues the third Tract, only becauſe ſome habituous ſteam (familiar to him) ſtrikes upon the olfactive Nerve, which in the other Tracts did not.</p>
            <p>For the operations of the rational Faculty, they are theſe: Firſt, Simply and barely to apprehend an Object. Secondly, To frame in our mindes a notion of it, diſtinct from the notion we have of other things, to compound,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:56873:47"/>
or ſever. And thirdly, To derive a Conſequence or concluſion from what the firſt Actions ſuggeſted to us. Let the inſtance be a Tree: Firſt, We ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend in our mindes a real thing. Secondly, We frame in our mindes an Idea, or notion of a Tree, different from the notion we have of other things; we frame in our mindes a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Tree, different from that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we have of a Bird, and by a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, or orderly introduction of Thoughts, we compound or ſever our Notions, wherein conſiſts truth or fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity; for Truth is a connexion of things whoſe nature and eſſence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, or a ſevering of things which dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer: Falſhood a connexion of things inconſiſtent, or a ſevering of things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable; there being no falſity in things themſelves, nor in our notions of them ſingly: when I conſider theſe notions ſingly and apart in my minde; A Bird, a Tree, to fly in the Ayre, to bear Fruit: here's no errour, nor fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity. But when I joyn two agreeing notions together, and think, or ſay thus; A Tree beareth Fruit, or a Bird flyeth in the Ayre: there is truth in
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:56873:47"/>
this Compoſition and Connexion of the terms: but if I ſay, a Tree flyeth in the Ayre, I joyn things inconſiſtent, and frame a falſe Propoſition. Upon this ſecond Act of the Underſtanding, the impoſition of Names ſeems to have been grounded; for a Name is nothing elſe but a note of diſtinction, an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary ſign whereby we intend no more, than only to impart to another man a notion which we have of a thing named, different from the notions we have of other things. Proceeding on another ſtep, we arrive at the third Operation of the rational Faculty: we finde that ſomthing will follow from what we gathered before; as thus: If a Tree beareth Fruit then it grows, and this we call diſcurſion.</p>
            <p>Some aſſiſtance may be afforded us in ſearching out the nature of the Underſtanding, or rational Faculty, if we reflect upon the notions we had of things when we were Children, and by what ſteps and aſſiſtances our knowledge advanced its ſelf. A Childe when he hears of a Tree, he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands the word, becauſe it hath been (as we take it for granted) often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcated
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:56873:48"/>
to him, the thing ſignified by it pointed at, and ſhewed to him; and becauſe it is a generally received word, whereby all men (ſo far as he knows) mean ſuch a thing. But he cannot frame in his minde any Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophical conception of it, only he fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies ſome particular Tree which he hath ſeen and remembers. But after a competent obſerving of ſeveral Trees, which he obſerves all of them to be erected with a full and ſtrong ſtem, to be ſtretched and ſevered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to divers branches, to bear Leaves and Fruit in their ſeaſon; he lets ſlip the notion of a particular Tree, and frames an univerſal notion of it in ſuch like thoughts: A ſolid bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy growing out of the earth, with boughs and branches ſtretched out, and bearing Fruit. So after he hath view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed divers particular men, perceives them all to be of an erect body, and to talk one with another, he abſtracts (or conſiders not) their individual properties, or appurtenances, their complexion, temper, cloathing, height of body, or the like; and when he thinks of a man, he frames in his minde
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:56873:48"/>
ſuch a deſcription of him, a living Creature of an erect body, and that can tell others what he means. So this reiteration of Senſe, called by ſome the ſpeculation of Phantaſms, is one ſtep whereby we creep on to knowledge.</p>
            <p>But for incorporeal things, which we obſerve not to make any vibration, or preſſion upon the Organs of Senſe; or (as ſome expeſs it) have no <hi>Species</hi> waſted over from their utmoſt Orbe to our Senſes, in theſe it is a great while before we can advance our thoughts any further, than the bare importance of the words by which they are expreſſed. God, Angels, Spirits, and our ſouls, we have very unſatisfying notions of them, the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects and remarkable operations which all men neceſſarily attribute to them, ſatisfie us that they are; but when we go about to conceive what they are, we are loſt, and content our ſelves to ſay they are incorporeal, immortal, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible; as much as to ſay, we know what they are not, we know not what they are.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:56873:49"/>Generally received Axioms, and clear fundamental Propoſitions, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived already to our hand, common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly finde eaſie admiſſion into our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings, yet with ſome diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; for that truth which to one man ſeems very cleer, another cannot perſwade himſelf to believe it: and to the ſame man ſome propoſitions ſeem credible, others not. Many times he ſuſpends his conſent, and then he is ſayd to doubt; if he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents warily and weakly, he is ſayd to have an opinion: or firmly, and then he is ſayd to believe. If this belief be procured by the evidence of the thing its ſelf, then it is called demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration; if by rational arguing, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction; if by humane teſtimonies, we may term it perſwaſion: if by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible and divine authority, Faith. Which degrees of Knowledge (if we conſider rightly) proceed not from any difference in the things, but from our Underſtandings, which look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them with a different aſpect. And ſo much concerning a ſecond ſtep or help to our Underſtandings, which is a borrowing of aſſiſtance from others.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:56873:49"/>When any thing is offered to a mans diſquiſition, a ſingle Notion, a Propoſition, or dubious Queſtion, what does he then do? but (as the uſual phraſe is) caſt about in his minde, rally his Thoughts, and put his Underſtanding into ſuch a poſture that it may finde it, and irradiate it: for the Underſtanding is of the nature of Light, the more or leſs it illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates a thing, the clearer or obſcurer is the reflection and repreſentation of it to us. Then if the Truth be of ſuch a nature, that it correſpond with that in-bred Light, thoſe innate Notions which Nature (by which I mean, the power and working of God in his Creatures) hath imprinted in his minde, which in ſeveral men are very various, of different degrees and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities; how ſoon does he own it? he cannot perſwade himſelf but that he had ſome labouring apprehenſions of it before, and wonders he ſhould be ſo long before he ſhould finde it out: and ſo here ſeems to be diſcovered a third means of procuring and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing our Knowledge, which (to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyd new fangled terms) may be

called the light of Reaſon. That there is ſuch a thing as this, will be eaſily granted; if we conſider, how that the firſt Inventer of any Science, <gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

Education and Inſtitution infuſe not any new quality into the Soul, but only excite and draw forth the latent Notions; as the Sun by its influence draws forth the Earth to its utmoſt fertility. There is in our Souls a natural harmony or conſent to the Principles of Sciences, but yet with a difference; for one man is more incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to this, or that Science, than an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; not from any real difference in the nature and ſubſtance of the Soul its ſelf; but from the various aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects

it carries with things; and the ſeveral poſtures men put themſelves into to purſue their ends.</p>
            <p>By theſe admirable faculties and opperations through which we have traced the ſoul, it will appear, that it is. To apprehend exactly what it is, and where it peculiarly reſides, is a matter of great obſcurity; yet to procure ſome ſatisfaction to our cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curioſity, let us ſuppoſe that there is in every living creature a pure and agile ſubſtance, compoſed of (or at leaſt reſembling) aire and fire; ſuch a ſubſtance as this will be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of projecting, and expanding its ſelf, will have an active quick motion, and eaſie penetrability, eſpecially through the Veines, Arteries, and Nerves, into every part of the body: and withall be capable of perceiving any vibration or preſſion made upon the parts of the body to which it is expanded; and ſuch a ſubſtance is the ſoul of a beaſt: Again, ſuppoſe ſuch a ſubſtance dignified with a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peraddition of power from God, and a command to exerciſe ſuch faculties as have been recited, and ſo we have
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:56873:51"/>
a tolerable and convenient account of the ſoul of man.</p>
            <p>But to reaſſume my method, <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clea</hi> (as alwaies ſo eſpecially) du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time ſhe was with child, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved good order in her diet, which was of meats of good nouriſhment, but ſparing and moderate, and in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, without which no body can enjoy a convenient ſtate of health, no not that of Infants unborn; ſedenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſs in the Mother begets a dull un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>activeneſſe in the Babe, moderate walking prevents it: Nor was ſhe leſs ſedulous to avoid all diſordered paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and perturbations of the mind; which, as they excite ſome unbecom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſymptomes in the Mother, ſo they operate upon the Child; of ſo great importnance is it to the framing of a well ſhaped and well tempered babe, to prevent annoyances before he be born; many perturbations of mind and indecent geſtures of the body may probably owe their original to ſome indiligences of their Mothers before they were born.</p>
            <p>Being born they adminiſtred unto him a ſmall quantity of refined Sugar,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:56873:51"/>
to clear the bowels of ſuch ſlimy hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors as uſually reſide there, and cree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping into the veins might produce convulſions, or other dangerous ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms; they waſh'd him in clear fountain water with a ſmall quantity of ſalt, thereby to dry &amp; conſolidate the fleſh, and ſtrengthen the ſinewes. After they had firſt carefully cut the umbilical vein, leſt the parts thereabout ſhould prove ill proportioned and irregular. <hi>Vracus enim (ut perhibent) nimis co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arctatus, &amp; conſtrictus, genitalia mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bra comprimit et ſterilitatem plenumque inducit, idem praeter juſtum laxatus, &amp; diſtentus, veſicam ei annexam quaſi poudere quodam iiſdem partibus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbere ſinit; unde penis in maſculo, uteruſve in foemina ſupra modum au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getur &amp; cafeſit, non ſine priapiſmi &amp; immodicae ſalacitatis periculo.</hi> Nor were they leſs ſedulous in wrapping and ſwathing his little body to fortifie it againſt the cold, and keep the parts from wringing and ſwerving aſide, and retain the hot exhalations from breaking out of the body.</p>
            <p>But neither did they ſwath him too ſtreight, nor immure him up too warm;

the firſt by cruſhing in the breaſt and ribs (which are then but cartilagine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and flexible) hinders the free paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of humors, and may beget dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous obſtructions: the other may contract a weak and effeminate tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, unfit to encounter with variety of air and weather, to which he muſt afterward of neceſſity be expoſed. But as they cheriſhed him by conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient heat, ſo as his condition might by degrees, and not on a ſudden, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline from that he enjoyed in the womb; ſo by degrees they prudently inured him to the ſeveral qualities of the air, when no exceſs prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Timoclea</hi> her ſelf was his Nurſe, this ſhe accounted her duty; and beſides, more conducing to the good of the child, that ſhe ſhould receive nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from her whoſe temper was fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar to him, than from a ſtranger, which cannot but alter the childes temper more or leſſe: although in ſome caſes it be prudence to admit of a ſtranger, as if the mother be of an infirm or depraved conſtitution; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided that ſuch an one be choſen, as
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:56873:52"/>
is of a good temperature, and a vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous elocution, which is of great effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy to make the child lively, and be preparative to his good pronunciati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Timoclea</hi> accuſtomed him to eat often, but ſparingly, becauſe too much nouriſhment makes little ones groſs and thick, the ſtomach full ſtuft, muſt needs thruſt forth the parts ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent, as every one will eaſily ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, but it hinders their growth in height. The meates ſhe gave him at firſt, were moiſt, and of eaſy dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, agreeable to his preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and ſuch as were uſually given to children; more firm and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid meats afterwards, as he grew in ſtrength. All theſe diligences uſed about him, I have not collected as things remarkable and extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; but only to ſhew that nothing conſiderable was omitted. But in this ſhe obſerved ſome ſingularly, that ſhe did not (as it is uſual with Nurſes to do) terrify him with bugbares, <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mera</hi>'s, and ſuch ſeemingly inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent fooleries, which they will often inculcate to them, and pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the ſtarting and averſion
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:56873:53"/>
the little ones expreſſe at the ſight or hearing of ſuch things as they uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſcare them with; for indeed every motion, action, or geſture of a Child carries a becomingneſſe with it, and is pleaſing to the beholders. This lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſory aſtoniſhment of Infants ſeems to carry no great appearance of harm, yet may inſenſibly leave ſuch an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion upon the fancy, that after reaſon and diſcreſſion obtain force, they find ſome trouble to correct &amp; undeceive themſelvs: ſome indecent tripidation and commotion invades them at their incountring with ſuch objects: and hence may proceed that ſecret averſion men find in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from ſome things, (commonly called antipathy) a diſtaſt they took againſt it in their infancy, though no body obſerved how, or at what time; terror and ſadneſſe acquired in infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, cauſe one ever after to be penſive and low ſpirited, and the ſame may be underſtood of any other paſſion of the mind: So true is the obſervation of a grave and wiſe author, that we own the well and evil being of our lives, to the diſcreet or ill managing
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:56873:53"/>
of our infant years; Crying is a thing which in infants cannot be avoided, and (if moderate) wants not its bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, it vents forth drowſie humors, which would make them unactive, purges the brain, dilates the paſſages about the breſt, ſtirs up the natural heat, and makes them lively; but if exceſſive, exhauſts the moiſture and ſpirits too much, makes them diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to peeviſhneſſe, and laies the foundation of a cholerick and fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward diſpoſition.</p>
            <p>When he began to walk about and prattle, he was entertained with ſuch toyes as not only pleaſed his mind, but ſomewhat buſied the memory and fancy, by numbering, ordering, and regular contriving: Although his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents love and indulgence was very great, yet they were ſo diſcreet as not to diſcover it to be ſo; they would not have him treated as a little Prince, or exerciſe a petty Monarchy in the family; but taught him to be obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent betimes, and courteous to all though never ſo mean, aſſuring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, he would be ſo much the more fit to govern with diſcreſſion when
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:56873:54"/>
time ſhould be, he was not accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to too much pleaſure and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to have his mind fulfilled in all things, but a reſtraint ſometimes put upon him, to teach him contentedneſs, and the skill of willingly wanting ſomething; all inimical affectation of geſtures, and pomp of words was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned; commendations and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements when he did well, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and rebuke for doing amiſſe, were not forgotten: the latter are as uſefull as the former, where there is need; but for him they were not of much neceſſity, his Parents example and mild inſtructions were ſufficient to keep him in good order; and I have formerly told the Reader, how prudently the family was governed, and what manner of ſervants retained; a thing very conſiderable, for there are no ſuch pernicious enemies to good education, as rude and uncivil ſervants who condeſcending to the humors of children more than the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and Maſters ought to do, cauſe them to affect and learn their geſtures and diſcourſes, how rude ſoever; and many times they will endeavour to
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:56873:54"/>
vilifie and bring into diſlike him that inſtructs them otherwiſe. Many Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents buſying their thoughts about the limiting of their Fortunes and future Eſtates, take no notice of theſe Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs. But in a Family where no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Vice is tollerated, nothing but good actions ſeen, not an uncivil expreſſion heard, (as it was in <hi>Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>'s houſe) where ſhall a Child learn evil? if at any time his Parents were undecent in their paſſions and expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, (as ſome forcible occaſion might urge them) they would not (if it might be avoided) let him obſerve it; much reverence and grave reſpect is due to an old man,<note place="margin">Juven.

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:56873:55"/>
I intend to ſhew, if God permit. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, this ocular way of teaching is the certaineſt, where it may be had; one may ſooner learn to ſteer a ſhip in the Sea by ſeeing it often done, than by a great many tedious Precepts and Rules; not only Children, but Men are led more by Examples than Precepts; thoſe elaborate Diſcourſes and earneſt Exhortations to Piety and Goodneſs, wherewith ſome think to work wonders in reforming the World, have not ſo forcible an operation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on men, as the example of one eminent Perſon. The People are as much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by the eye as by the ear; and therefore he that hath the intention to make them irreligious, need but only aſtoniſh them with ſome ſtrange ſublime notions, take away their Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies and religious Services, which have ſomething of viſible in them, and the work is done.</p>

               <hi>Eriander</hi> was rather of a round than long viſage, his eyes of a Hazle or Cheſnut colour, equally fixt, ready and vigorous in motion, neither prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, nor ſinking in their <hi>orbits,</hi> his hair a bright yellowiſh colour, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:56873:55"/>
by degrees to brown: his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head ſomewhat high and ſmooth, and of a convenient bredth: his comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion florid and ruddy, mixt with a convenient bluſhing: his exterior li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neaments of an exact ſymetry, his ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture ever keeping a correſpondency with his years, ſo that it was conjectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red he would prove of a convenient middle ſtature: his ſkin betwixt ſmooth and rugged; his veins of a fit dimenſion, and his pulſe moderate. His lovely countenance and ſweet diſpoſition cauſed him to be beloved of all Children; ſuch as were of equal age and bigneſs would ſtrive to ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate themſelves into his favour, to keep him company, to ſtudy to imitate him, to pleaſe him, to be pleaſed and delighted with him. Comlineſs is of its ſelf attractive; how much more when it is joyned with good condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? it wins the love of people that are not rude and barbarous, diffuſes a kind of hilarity to all that behold it. Indeed all the Characteriſms and <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea</hi>'s of the Countenance are conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, (the word may be taken in a good as well as in a bad ſenſe) they
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:56873:56"/>
faſcinate, and at a diſtance infect the Beholders; whether it be by certain rayes, ſteams, or emanations emergent from them, which make a preſſion or light motion upon the nerves; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of ſuch perſons as are of a deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and tender complexion: or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be by ſome other occult means; but ſo it is, that one cheerfull man in a Company, one of a free dilated ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, more or leſs irradiates the whole company with his preſence into a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renity of countenance; one ſad per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon infects a whole company with ſome contagion of ſadneſs.</p>
            <p>Before <hi>Eriander</hi> was put abroad to School, they taught him to read and write at home, as it were by way of recreation, they had a ſmooth and ſquare plate of braſs, and of conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient bigneſs for a child to handle and carry about; in this Plate, or Table, the draughts and effigies's of all the letters in the Alphabet were ingraven exactly; they acquainted him with the true ſhape and diſtinct names of them, and cauſed him to follow the draughts of them with a little Stile, or Penſil provided for that purpoſe; by
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:56873:56"/>
this running as it were in the Channels, and following the ſtream of every letter, while the hollow ſtrokes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained his hand from going awry, he gained a dexterity in it, and was not a little aſſiſted to write with pen and ink, becauſe his hand was habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated by this luſory way of writing; but in ſpelling, or forming of ſylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, (to which the eye contributes no advantage) they took the opportunity of all vacant hours to inculcate them by often repetition, endeavouring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all things to procure a clear and diſtinct pronunciation, to which no more was required but practice; for nature had ſo framed all the Organs ſerving to ſpeech, that none of them was mutilated, or irregular. They ſtill prae-poſſeſs'd him with a love of Learning, and a deſire of his Book and the School; contrary to the indiſcreet practice of many people, who pleaſe themſelves in terrifying children with the Rod and <hi>Ferula,</hi> whereby they bring them into a diſlike of Learning, before they have diſcretion to know what it is. His Father obtained a good aſſurance of his proficiency, not only
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:56873:57"/>
from his comly lineaments of body, ingenuous aſpect, vigorous elocution, and the like exterior characters of a towardly nature, but from thoſe more immediate and ſignal tokens which are leſs obvious, but afford more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and infallible preſages. 1. A ready Wit, which appeared by his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent anſwers to any queſtion within the bounds of a childs capacity. 2. A faithful Memory, which diſcovered its ſelf, by giving an ingenuous ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of any remarkable paſſage he had heard of. 3. He was patient and induſtrious, not like thoſe haſty and volatile wits, who having a nimble apprehenſion, and confidence withal, perform all they go about with little pains, and in a ſhort ſpace raiſe great expectations concerning themſelves; but ſoon ſpend their ſtock, become Bankrupts, and, like a nine-dayes wonder, are ſoon forgotten. 4. He had an earneſt affection and deſire to Learning; a thing ſo conſiderable that without a kind of love and earneſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire men ſeldom thrive in any profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. 5. He was attentive, and would expreſs a kind of exultation and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:56873:57"/>
at the recital of any remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and ingenuous paſſage. 6. He was inquiſitive, even to importunity; which in a child is commendable; and although it may ſeem to proceed from overmuch boldneſs, yet if it ariſe not to downright ſaucineſs, it is not to be blamed; ſuch a one will grow ſedate as he proceeds in years. 7. He was very ready in imitating (not the Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtical geſtures and expreſſions of vain but) the decent ſpeeches and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes of diſcreet and well-bred per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. 8. He modeſtly affected com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations, a powerful incentive to goodneſs, if it meet with an ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous nature; and a touchſtone to try ones temper, whether he incline to Pride or Humility. Commendations for well-doing, and rebukes for an offence prevail more with a good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, than blows; which alſo to one of a bad nature oft-times do more hurt than good; for obdurate ſpirits are ſo far from being cudgelled into goodneſs, that thereby they gather ſtrength in naughtineſs. Theſe eight tokens meeting together in any child, promiſe good ſucceſs, and (if due
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:56873:58"/>
culture and inſtruction be adjoyned) ſilence all doubt of his proficiency in learning; but he that is not in ſome tolerable ſort thus qualified, (though we ought not raſhly and haſtily to deſpair of any, what is now latent Time may reveal) is not fit to be a Student in the Liberal Arts.</p>
            <p>At the age of ſeven years <hi>Eriander</hi> was admitted into the famous School of <hi>Entaphia,</hi> where we muſt now leave him at his book in earneſt; that lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſory and recreative way of teaching (which ſerved as a preparative to make Learning ſeem delightfull) muſt bear date no longer; it will not ſuit with the diſcipline of a School. Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the orders and manner of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment obſerved in this little Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, were ſomewhat diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from ſuch as are uſually obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in other Schools, it will not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs to ſet them down. It was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by a Preſident or Provoſt, whoſe charge was to take Inſpection of the Maſters and inferior Officers, to inſtruct the Scholars in the principles of Religion and Manners, at certain times appointed for their inſtruction
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:56873:58"/>
and examination; and eſpecially to give order and direction, that every one ſhould be fitted for that profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and employment, to which, after due examination, he found him moſt incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: the firſt or loweſt Maſter (for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one was abſolue Maſter over thoſe that belonged to him) taught them to read and underſtand the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the Country; the next taught them to write and caſt up ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, that ſo ſuch as were not found fit to proceed to the nobler Sciences, might in due time be qualified for ſome other Profeſſion, according as their peculiar <hi>Genius</hi> and their Parents deſires invited them. The third taught the Latine; and the fourth the Greek tongue. Beſides they had a Steward or Purveyer, which provided dyet &amp; other accomodations for ſuch as were remote from their Parents, and gave up his account to the Preſident at the end of every three months.</p>
            <p>The Preſident and Maſters had their convenient lodgings private and apart, as alſo a room to teach their Schollars in, but in the publick Chappel they all met together twice in a day;
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:56873:59"/>
and in the <hi>Refectory</hi> or Dining-room: which being very capacious, ſerved the Schollers as a Cloiſter to walk or recreate themſelves in rainy or tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtious weather: In fair and clear daies they were injoyned to diſport them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves abroad in the open ayr, in a large Court provided for that purpoſe, and ſo ſcituated that the Preſident might eaſily ſee from his Chamber and obſerve their carriage. The num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Schollars under the firſt Maſter (by the ſtatutes of the houſe) was not to exceed 30, and the ſame num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber was alloted to the ſecond; but the third and fourth might entertain 50, becauſe ſuch as they dealt with could be conveniently digeſted into formes, and ſo be taught together: but with the conſent of the Preſident, any of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> might ſomewhat exceed that number.</p>
            <p>After that <hi>Eriander</hi> had been reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent there about a year, it was thought fit by the Preſident, (having alſo conſulted with his Father about it,) that he ſhould be committed to the tuition of <hi>Amalthaeus,</hi> who was then Maſter of the Latine School; not
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:56873:59"/>
as if the learning of a language were ſuch a choice piece of breeding, (as ſome imagine, who derive all their hopes concerning their Children only from their nimbleneſſe in learning the Latine or Greek tongue, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair of ſuch as prove dull at them; whereas many become excellent at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sciences, who for want of a good memory and patience can never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer the difficulties of Grammer:) but they know that the Latine tongue and Greek (which he alſo learned,) being the receptacles of all Arts and Sciences, would be an incomparable advantage to him, whatſoever faculty he ſhould apply himſelf to. They in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended not he ſhould be a plodding Student in the tongus, but having once made ſome Art his aim, ſhould timely quit himſelf of the ſollicitous ſearch &amp; critical inquiring into words. Though ſome drowſy braines can; (yet noble and ingenious minds cannot) perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally confine themſelves to ſuch ſtudies, but having gained the principles of that Art which they intend to profeſſe, and being fit to appear with ſome cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit; make uſe of their knowledge:
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:56873:60"/>
which they every day increaſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine by converſation, diſcourſe, and practice: whereas they that pleaſe them ſelves meerly in ſpeculation, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce not their knowledge to practice, applauding themſelves with a brave conceit that they are learned men, the World puts them off with the homely title of meer-Schollars: and ſteems them as things of ſmall uſe.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Amalthaeus</hi> was a learned man and ſtudious; but ſo diſcreet in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of his ſtudies, that they hindred not his employments, nor diſpoſed him to a <hi>Cynical</hi> moroſneſſe, whereby one becomes unfit for ſociety. He made profeſſion only of Grammer, but was not a ſtranger in other Arts, by help whereof he was the better able to il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate what he read to his Schollars; there is a league between Arts, and they mutually contribute help one to another. He was of a moderate tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and winning carriage, could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend to the capacities and diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Children, and ſo gain their love and attention, a dexterity which every learned man cannot attain to; Teaching is a skill by its ſelf, in which a man of mean parts and no great
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:56873:60"/>
learning, many times out-does the greateſt Schollars. The moſt acute and ingenious men are uſually fierce and impatient in teaching, they vex and torment themſelves when they find that ſo hardly perceptible by another, which to them ſeem ſo eaſie; and in ſuch a caſe (if diſcretion be wanting) they tyrannize over the wretched Children, &amp; correct them not ſo much for their benefit, as to expiate their own fury. But <hi>Amalthaeus</hi> would not be angry except it were upon an ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent occaſion; nor then without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion: he never corrected any for dulneſſe, forgetfulneſſe, and the like effects in nature, and was ſo diligent in admoniſhing, and exacting a ſtrict account of their ſtudies at ſet and known hours, and ſo conſtant with them, as they ſeldom gave him occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to correct them for negligence: but for palpable and ſtubborn care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſſe, vicious and leud behaviour, he corrected them with ſeverity.</p>
            <p>It is a great queſtion whether mild or ſevere diſcipline be beſt; the firſt place Children gratifie indulgent Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and acquire the reputation of a kind nature to him that uſed it; but
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:56873:61"/>
the latter obtains ſucceſſe with more certainty; procures obedience and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, beſt curbs and reſtrains pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulant and ſtubborn natures, as mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe without caution degenerates into remiſneſſe, and begets carleſneſſe in thoſe that are under government; ſo ſtrictneſſe without diſcretion, advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces it ſelf into a furious tyranny, and begets a loathing; but where ſeverity hath prejudiced one, it may truely be ſaid that remiſneſſe hath undone a hundred. Thoſe times, and thoſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions wherein indulgence hath been in faſhion, have produced men of ſpruce and ſpritely parts, commonly called wits: but they who have uſed ſtrict diſcipline have ever bred the braveſt men, witneſſe the <hi>Spartans,</hi> ancient <hi>Romans,</hi> and ſome ſocieties in our time; the ſum of all is this, prudence accommodating its ſelf to the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar tempers of Children, obſerves a middle way betwixt both extremes, and deales with every one ſo as is convenient. This prudent obſerving of every Childs temper and capacity, is a thing eſpecially to be commended to ſuch as have the tuition of youth;
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:56873:61"/>
but it cannot be brought within the compaſſe of any rules, being the reſult of many reiterated experiences, and much practice.</p>
            <p>But to proceed, he invited and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lured modeſt Children with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations, good words, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with gifts: the bold and ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born he terrifyed with a ſtern look, &amp; ſharp correction. Such as were over-talkative were kept from company, they ſtill invited to it; frolick diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions allayed with a grave and ſerious look, the ſad and penſive treated with a cheerful aſpect. The induſtrious had their ſupernumerary hours of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty freely allowed them; for he knew that ſedentarineſs produceth ill humors, which make them unactive, and hinder their growth; which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient exerciſe diſperſes, and cauſes them to returne to their books with the greater alacrety and vigor: The careleſs and ſlothful were kept ſtrictly to their tasks, over nimble wits (for ſome ſuch there are) were ſtopt in their careere, yet with a ſpecial care that they might not be diſcouraged; He found that a merry ſharp conceit,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:56873:62"/>
or handſome rebuke prevailed with ſome, divers might be laughed or ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med out of their naughtineſs, others afrighted out of it; and accordingly he treated them. Sullen and Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick natures are of all others the moſt hard to be won; to humor and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mone them, makes themſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited and pleaſed with their folly: ſeverity makes them deſperate; his way was to let them alone, and ſeem to take no notice of them for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, till ſuch time as the humor had conſumed its ſelf and was vaniſhed; this done, he found ſeaſonable rebuks and advice as effectual unto theſe, as unto any other: in this he imitated the prudent Phyſician, who firſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares and concocts ill humors, then attempts to remove them.</p>
            <p>As to his exteriors, he was of a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming ſtature and perſonage, a ſtout ſpirit, and manly elocution: theſe contributed ſomething towards the gaining of reſpect, and keeping in awe the little people, who are ready to diſeſteem one of a low ſpirit, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh behaviour, or unhandſome li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neaments of body, though otherwiſe
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:56873:62"/>
of abilities to teach them.</p>
            <p>He had the happy vein of making his inſtructions pleaſing, by couching and intermingling them with perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent fables and ingenious compariſons and examples; which inſinuate into the minds of Children ſooner, than ſerious diſcourſes, that are not ſo quickly adverted by them. And that they might perfectly underſtand what he read or dictated to them, ſuch or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was obſerved, as that which went before induced that which followed by a natural conſequence; and too great ſpeed (which confounds tender wits) carefully avoyded: yet with an uninterrupted conſtancy. For, as in filling narrow-mouth'd veſſels, if we powre a full ſtream upon them, more ſlips beſide than runs in: So in tumultuous and precipitated teaching, many inſtructions are loſt, becauſe the intention of the hearer cannot comprehend them all: If any exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe were to be performed, which they had not uſed before, he would firſt do it himſelf, cauſing them to look on and obſerve; ſo guiding their hands, and as it were directing their
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:56873:63"/>
ſteps, that they might afterward make tryall of themſelves.</p>
            <p>The method which he obſerved in teaching the Latine tougue, was not any new-fangled device of a private man, but ſuch as was generally appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of and allowed by learned men, and enjoyned by ſtatutes to be uſed in that place. It proceeded by theſe ſteps. 1. They taught them to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the Letters diſtinctly, and to know the difference. Then 2. They acquainted them with the nature of ſyllables: And 3. with the ſeveral kinds of words, and their manner of declining; omitting the ſcrupulous and leſſe-neceſſary exceptions, till they had learned all the Grammatical Rules. Then 4. They proceeded to the uſual and ordinary rules of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; reading withall ſome eaſie Latine-book. And to imprint the rules of Grammer more firmly in their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, they were obliged to call them to account by examinations once in three daies at leaſt. Proceeding on to Authors, they 5. taught them the nature and differences of accents, and the points of diſtinction in ſentences,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:56873:63"/>
that in reading they might know when to ſuſpend and ſtop their voice, when to raiſe or depreſſe it; and beſides that, They 6. cauſed them to parſe every ſentence, giving an account of words and points of conſtruction, according to the rules they had lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. It was 7. their office to ſhew the Schollars the order obſervable in conſtruing; as if in the ſentence there were a Vocative caſe, that to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken firſt. If a queſtion were asked, the interrogative is firſt to be conſtrued; If theſe be not in the ſentence, (or if they be; then next to them) the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minative caſe, and whatſoever agrees with it; the Verb, and whatſoever is governed of that, as an Infinitive mood, or caſual word; but becauſe practice and obſervation are the beſt guides in theſe things; therefore 8. they cauſed them to make frequent tryal; 9. So ſoon as they had through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly learned the ordinary Rules of <hi>Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tax</hi>; they ſpake Latine not only in the School, but in the <hi>Refectory</hi> and at their play. 10. They uſed double tranſlations 2 or 3 daies in a week; turned a ſentence or two in ſome La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:56873:64"/>
Author into the vulgar tongue, and laying aſide their books, into La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine again: which was a means to make them exact in the <hi>Orthography</hi> of both tongues, and prepared them for making Epiſtles, Themes, Verſes and ſuch School-exerciſes by way of Imitation, and ſuch Exerciſes they made twice in a week.</p>
            <p>This method (though diſliked by ſome new-fangled perſons, which ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil at every thing themſelves deviſe not, becauſe it was an old way of teaching, and thought too tedious by ſuch as loved their eaſe) was ſo hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomely managed by the dexterity of <hi>Amalthaeus,</hi> that the School very much flouriſhed in his time, and bred up many excellent Wits; for, deliberate proceedings, &amp; ſedate advancements, accompanied with certainty, produce better effects in teaching, than over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haſty and precipitate courſes: which make a great ſplendor for a while, but conſpire with time to betray their own vanity. Some have adventured to comprize the whole Latine tongue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a portable <hi>Enchiridion,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing throughly learned, they conceive
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:56873:64"/>
the children thereby ſufficiently ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated, and able to manage their ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of themſelves, without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther expatiating in Authors; a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne very plauſible; and pitty it is, it anſwers not expectation: for if it did, it would free the Teachers and Schollars of much trouble incident to the known way of learning a language by reading of Authors. It is probable that they who firſt recommended it to uſe, had formerly learned the Latine tongue by reading of divers Authors, and at laſt meeting with, or contriving ſuch an abridgement, as comprized the moſt remarkable words and phraſes, found a marvelous aſſiſtance afforded to their memory; which in ſmall ſpace retrived what they had ſo long queſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after in many volumes: whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they fancyed that it might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a quick diſpatch in teaching of young Schollars. Indeed to a man that hath ſpent ſome compentent time in the ſtudy of any Art, or language, a <hi>Compendium</hi> is a ſingular help to his memory: but one that comes raw and unfurniſhed, will never prove ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Maſter of it, if he trades only
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:56873:65"/>
in abridgements. To ingratiate this compendious method, they alledge by way of compariſon, that a man may ſoon take a view of divers creatures incloſed in a room, ſuch as <hi>Noahs</hi> Ark; whereas it would be a long and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry labour to travel into ſeveral parts to take a view of them: So to peruſe variety of words and phraſes in an <hi>Enchiridion,</hi> contrived on purpoſe to exhibit them, is a work of ſmal labour and ſhort time: True; but as he that views thoſe creatures ſo incloſed, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not take a particular view, or make ſo diſtinct obſervation of their natures as by traveling abroad and taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of their haunts, feedings, actions, and the like; becauſe the very crowd obſtructs his animadverſion, &amp; deprives him of a leiſurable obſervation, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry neceſſary in the exerciſes of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory. So he that attemps to gain a language crampt into a <hi>Compendium,</hi> whereby the ſenſe becomes forced and obſcure, ſhall never attain to it with ſo much certainty, as he that will take the paines to travel over the choiceſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, where he may find his pains re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited with a knowledge of the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:56873:65"/>
and ſincere meaning of words; the genuine uſe and extent of <hi>phraſes</hi>: beſides the knowledge of many excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent things on the by, which ever leave ſome impreſſion upon the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>functory and careleſs Reader, and will be uſeful in the ordinary tranſlations of his life. Our progreſſe in learning reſembles the motion of the ſhaddow of a Dial, the ſhooting forth of graſſe, or (to take a compariſon nearer,) the advancement of the mind in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge reſembles the growth of the body in ſtature; the moſt ſcrutinous eye is not able to diſcover each minute degree of augmentation: but it may eaſily be obſerved at convenient diſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of time. In which particular there is nevertheleſſe a great diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity; ſome after a ſmall continuance at their books are able on a ſudden to utter all they know, and make ſhew of more. Others are unready upon ſudden encounters, who yet after a convenient reſearch, can deliver (a leſſe ſpecious, but) a more ſolid ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of ſuch things as ſeemed to be <hi>latent</hi> in them. And the ſame is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable in men who lay claim to wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:56873:66"/>
or Religion, about which many will diſcourſe with taking expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and great ornament of words: whilſt others cannot give a ſudden ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of them, yet upon any occaſion when they come to practice, clearly diſcover that they are guided by ſuch rules that occur not at preſent to their remembrance. This is ſo well known to the wiſe, that whereas men of vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar underſtandings admire the firſt ſort, they juſtly prefer the latter: and if ſuch quick dilated wits ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times deceive wiſe men, it is but as gloſed wares or counterfeit jewels im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon men at the firſt view, which when exactly looked into loſe their grace; or, as many <hi>Romances</hi> and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etical ſtories, which the oftener they are read, the leſs we are affected with them; whereas men of ſedate and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found minds ſo thriftily manage their diſcours, that the oftener we converſe with them, the more we may learn of them. Beſides what hath been ſaid concerning thoſe compendious waies of teaching, it is very well known to the learned that ſuch abridgments are uſually made up of the <hi>Radical</hi> and

chief words of a language looſly tackt together. But the learned know very well that an exact underſtanding of the particles and ſmall words is excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding neceſſary, becauſe in the uſe of theſe the <hi>idiom</hi> and propriety of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages is chiefly ſeen: In which thing ſuch abridgements being defective, cannot but fall ſhort of what they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</p>
            <p>Their method for the Greek, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was not different from this for the Latine Tongue, I ſhall not need to deſcribe: So it was, that <hi>Eriander</hi> proved a good Proficient in both lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages; inſomuch that at the age of ſeventeen years, he was judged fit for the Univerſity; neither was he ever removed from that School, but kept cloſe to the ſame method: a great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage doubtleſs to his proficiency, for young Wits, like young Trees, by being often tranſplanted are robb'd of their ſtrength, and become unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. The reaſon is evident, for to omit that ſeldom any two Maſters ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the ſame method punctually in every reſpect; ſo that by changing the mindes of children are diſtracted,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:56873:67"/>
and the former notions diſturbed: It is a great while ere a perfect alliance and correſpondence betwixt the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> of the Maſter and Schollar can be acquired; which, though it ſeem a nicety, a kind of myſterious conceit; yet indeed is a principal matter to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance his proceeding. This conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is worthy to be recommended to thoſe new-fangled and unconſtant Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, who upon any ſmal occaſion of diſlike, poſt their Children from one Maſter to another, ſeldom for their good, though they change for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. It is a bold aſſertion, and yet very true, and grounded upon ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient obſervation; that a Maſter, or Tutor, of mean and ordinary parts, may teach a Schollar well enough, if he be diligent, and the Schollar capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: (preſuming the Schollar ſhall not be admitted under the tuition of one more ignorant than himſelf) for, by a continued diligence both will do themſelves good, there being no ſuch way for a man to improve his ſkill, as by communicating it and teaching o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>And now that <hi>Eriander</hi> was to lanch
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:56873:67"/>
forth into the world, and appear more publickly at the Univerſity, and ſuch places of concourſe and frequency; care was taken to put him under the tuition of a grave and learned man, and withall to procure him the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance of ſuch young Students, as, beſides their conference and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, which contributed much to him in relation to learning, might al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by their civility of manners induce him to courſes of Honeſty and Manli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. There are not wanting in ſuch places many that take occaſion from their unripe years, good-nature, and unwary judgements, to make a prey of young Gallants; to whom (as they ſay of Harlots) they wiſh all good things except Diſcretion. It is certain that from ſeventeen to ſeven and twenty is the moſt fickle and dangerous part of a mans life; Before that time the Parents or Maſters Authority, fear, or the want of occaſions prevent or keep under many diſorders, which then, if ever, will begin to appear; and are not ſo eaſily remedied, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are become more ſturdy and inflexible, like ſtiff and tough
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:56873:68"/>
bodies, which may by violence be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed and drawn into ſuch a Figure as their nature abhors; but ſo ſoon as the maſtering violence leaves them at liberty, they return with a nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble jerk unto their natural ſtate.</p>
            <p>One thing I had almoſt forgot; his Father would never let him know what eſtate he intended to ſettle upon him, till he ſhould arrive at ſuch a pitch of diſcretion as to ſet no more than a due eſtimation upon it; he had obſerved, that the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of riches to children often made them remiſs in their ſtudies, inſolent in their behaviour, and not ſo tracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and obedient as thoſe which are under diſcipline ought to be; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if ſome Flatterer be ready at hand to tickle their ears with a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing conceit, that they are born to an eſtate which will maintain them and their retinue bravely, without labour; a long worſhipful title, which it is pitty to blemiſh with the name of a Schollar: theſe will ſupply all defects, cauſe the people to magnifie them, and ſhadow over all the ſtains of their nature and manners. But <hi>Charinus</hi>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:56873:68"/>
ſtill told his Son, he muſt endeavour to apply himſelf to ſo me Science for his ornament and accommodation, though not meerly for his ſupport, though his eſtate ſhould be never ſo plentifull, yet to be brought up to an Imployment would be neither burden nor diſpargement, but an advanage many waies. If an Eſtate fails, Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry may ſupport a man; If his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion incline him to any particular vice, the wit of man never deviſed a better remedy againſt it than Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; the thoughts of vain pleaſures and the penſive remembrance of cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities privily ſteal away from an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt or Student, whoſe mind is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſt in the contemplation of his Art: whilſt he that for want of Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment knowes not how to give his thoughts entertainment, or keep com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with time, is almoſt neceſſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſome vain or degenerate courſe, and having nothing to do, learnes to do ill.</p>
            <p>For the choice of his ſtudy, or particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar faculty to which he ſhould be deſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, it was now thought fit to conſider of it; &amp; provide that he ſhould apply
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:56873:69"/>
himſelf to ſuch a courſe as was moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to his diſpoſition; not forced upon that from which he might ſeem averſe. It is true; a man of good parts &amp; rare ingenuity, may by diligence at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a competent inſight into any Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſo far at leaſt as concerns the <hi>Theory</hi>; and to give a rational account of moſt Sciences is expected in a Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar: yet there is a peculiar <hi>Genius,</hi> or propenſity of mind in every man, whereby he is more vigorouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to one Science than to another, and an infinite variety there is in mens wits, and natural faculties; the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal cauſes whereof are theſe.</p>
            <p>1. The appointment and deſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, who having placed men in a world adorned with variety of objects, diſtributes to them diverſity of notions and conceits to apprehend; different humors and affections to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, ſome one thing, ſome another: thereby to maintain a general inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe among them. But in regard that God works by ſecond &amp; ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate cauſes, which fall more evidently under our obſervation, and many of them are manageable by us: We muſt
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:56873:69"/>
ſecondly, conſider the poſitions and aſpects of the Stars; For experience (the only rule in theſe matters) ſeem to make it appear, that at the inſtant of a childs birth, (or rather more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful at his conception,) he receives an influence from the Planets, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Coeleſtial bodies, which at that juncture of time have dominion over the place where the conception or birth is made. Such then as have <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi> for the Lord of their genitures, ſhall be quick-witted, merry and of a gentle nature. Where <hi>Mercury</hi> is Lord of the <hi>horoſcope,</hi> his influence produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces (they ſay,) a quick wit, but ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatile and unconſtant. <hi>Mars</hi> cauſeth fierceneſs and temerity. <hi>Saturn</hi> makes men ſlow, but commonly ſure. The <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon,</hi> according to their various aſpects, produce ſeveral alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations in our bodies, in our ſenſitive faculties, (and accidentally in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, which often conforms its ſelfe to the ſenſitive part,) is clear by dayly experience, and it is probable that the other Coeleſtial bodies may in their degree produce divers admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble effects, though they be not ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:56873:70"/>
and apparent, 3. The temper of the body hath a remarkable influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon the operations of the mind; for, as water ſliding through a Mine grates off ſome part of the matter through which it ſlides, diſſolves it into its ſelf, and ſo admits a tincture and taſt of the Mineral; or as rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water which is of its ſelf of an uniform taſt and ſavour, is diverſified when ſucked into plants of a different tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; in Rue it is bitter, in Sorrel ſowre, and ſweet in <hi>Glycyrrize</hi>: ſo the Soul neceſſitated to move and act in a body full of ſeveral humors, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it receives no ſubſtantial alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; yet by its operations it clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcovers an alliance contracted with thoſe humors, eſpecially the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial blood and ſpirit which are the Souls chief inſtruments; ſo that men of a hot temper (agreeable to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of that quality) are active, ſprite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, of a ready conceit, quick diſpatch, &amp; (if the heat exceed) peeviſh, or fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick. The cold are ſlow, reſerved, tenatious, and (if the quality exceed) diſpoſed to Melancholy, ſadneſſe and deſpair. Moiſture (if conveniently
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:56873:70"/>
temper'd) cauſes a good remembrance; if otherwiſe, it makes men dull, heavy and ſottiſh. A clear drineſſe makes men diſcreet, of a clear wit, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern or illuminate things. Next to this 4. the different habitude and proporiton of the body may be of ſome force, for ſuch as are of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence ſtature, through the diffuſion of the ſpirits, are obſerved to be (for the moſt part) dul and heavy in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes of the mind: the little (through the combining and cloſe uniting of the natuarl heat,) peeviſh, fierce and froward, and the middle ſtature is moſt commendable. But 5. a more remarkable and immediate cauſe may be derived from the various faculties of the ſoul, of which all men have not an equal ſhare; ſome enjoy a good me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, and thoſe are fitteſt to deal with ſuch Arts wherein are many names, words, and rules. Such as have ſtrong fancies, quick imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, are fitteſt for ſuch Profeſſions in which there is required quaintneſſe of diſcourſe, handſome contrivances, ſymmetry or proportion. They who excel in depth of underſtanding, are
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:56873:71"/>
beſt able to ſearch out the nature and cauſes of things, to determine doubts and decide controverſies, to make choice, and judge of things, to make ſubtil and deep inquiries, and are therefore beſt qualified for ſuch Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences as are guided by theſe exerciſes of the mind.<note place="margin">Jo. Huar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes &amp; Anton. Zara.</note> And to this <hi>Triplicity</hi> I find all variety of wits reduced, by thoſe that have formerly written con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them; and not inconvenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; becauſe theſe three faculties are of ſuch remarkable effecacy in the gaining of learning. But in theſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties there is much variety, which deſerves our remark: for if we look upon the judgement or underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-faculty, we find this man quick, the other ſlow in the exerciſes of it; one man reſerved and cloſe, another free, open, and communicative: And the like differences appear in ſuch as excel in the faculty of imagination, ſome are nimble, others deliberate, ſome of a recluſe, others of a dilated <hi>genius.</hi> And as for the memory, ſome are readieſt in remembring of words; ſome ſooneſt remember places, others the names of men, but moſt mens me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories ſooneſt retain ſentences orderly
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:56873:71"/>
placed, few hath ſuch vaſt memories as to recollect a multitude of indige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted unconnexed words, neither would it be a thing of any great uſe, but words duly ordered and comprized, contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute a great advantage to the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; this variety which is diſcovered in theſe three faculties ſhall be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice of in due place. 6. The different paſſions and ſeveral ends, to which mens appetites lead them are to be conſidered, a covetous man uſually applies himſelf to ſome lucrative Art; an ambitious man to ſuch as is moſt in eſteem, and may further his promoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and is content to be a ſtranger in the reſt, which are not ſubſervient to his deſign. 7. And laſtly, Education, for the mind as it receives an impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from thoſe objects it hath been moſt acquainted with in youth retains them very firmely, by degrees falls in love with them, &amp; by conſequence with ſuch Arts as have relation to them.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the principal reaſons of that variety which is found in men in relation to the gaining of Arts; there are divers other, which becauſe they have power to alter their complexion,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:56873:72"/>
humor and inclination, may occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally diſpoſe them to ſuch Sciences as be moſt agreeable to the temper they have contracted: As 1. the Lawes, and 2. the Cuſtomes of Nations, which if good and wholſome, diſpoſe people to induſtry and honeſty; if corrupt, deprave their minds, blind the eyes of many men, ſilence the voice of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and raze the dictates of reaſon out of their affections, ſo as the moſt pernicious vice being tolerated by cuſtom, will ſoon be approved and beloved by men, and gain the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a kind of Vertue; Wantonneſſe will be accounted Good-breeding, and Licentiouſneſſe a generous Liberty, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance Liberality, Impudence Courage, &amp; valour; Drunkeneſs will u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurp the leſs-diſtaſtful name of Good-fellowſhip, Adultery loſe its leſſe-pleaſing name under the title of Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; nay, Inceſt its ſelfe, and other unnatural vices, have through the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency of a corrupt cuſtom paſſed without control among ſome whole Nations. On the contrary, Vertue is often traduced, and good qualities defamed by odious names; Modeſty
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:56873:72"/>
is accounted ſillineſſe, or want of wit and breeding: Temperance called co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſſe, gravity and thrift clow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhneſſe. 3. Somthing may be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the different forms of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment men live under; in an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtocracie,</hi> we may obſerve the fervor, arrogance, and ambition of the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees; their engines and intricate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances to raiſe monyes, to advance their families, to purchaſe great Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, to live in ſplendor, to ſubvert their equals, and keep under their inferiors; the publick concernments alwaies pretended, but never regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; publick Revenues horded up in private Coffers; Vertue is diſcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced, diſcipline neglected; weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy men in great power, the inferior people ſlaviſh &amp; beggarly: hence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed factions and animoſities, trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous attempts againſt great men, and the like. In a popular govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the rich ſlaviſhly court the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in order to the acquiring of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, the people grow inſolent and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited: True and cordial Honeſty is condemned, airy and frothy opinions of knowledge altogether in faſhion,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:56873:73"/>
with a vaunting bravery concerning their own, and contempt of former times: a general licentiouſneſs and toleration of all enormities prevails; youth is given over to all voluptuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and debauchery; which they miſcal a free and generous liberty: and this the great men many times ſmooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and cloſly connive at, becauſe thereby an advantage is offered them of engroſſing the Eſtates of young Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digals. (Such miſcheifes may and do happen in the beſt government, but in this they ſeem more naturally to grow up;) Through this general to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration and liberty every man begins to have a good conceit of himſelf, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemes himſelf not inferior to any, but as good as the beſt: Inferior per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ariſe by degrees to ſuch a height of inſolence, that they contemn their ſuperiors; ſervants prove diſreſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to their Maſters, and children to their Parents; youth growes imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and ſtubborn; factions and diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders prevail among the people, who wanting means to ſecure their own quiet, and lay theſe diſorders which they have conjured up; ſome cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:56873:73"/>
popular Grandee peradventure offers himſelf, or is made choice of to be their Guardian and <hi>Protector,</hi> who (to carry on his deſign with leſſe ſuſpition) ſalutes and courts the ſilly multitude; is their ſervant, and will ſacrifice his Intereſt, his life and all, to promote theirs: but once advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced beyond their reach, makes a prey of them, keeps them poor, that ſo if they have the will, yet they may not have the power to reſiſt him: To all men who are eminent either for Wealth, Wiſdom, or Courage, he is in a manner neceſſitated to be an Enemy; and it ſhall go hard but he will charge them with ſome crime, that he may have ſome color to deſtroy them: but none ſooner taſt of his fury, than ſuch as have been inſtrumental to his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancment, if (as it commonly happens) they once begin to grumble at his greatneſſe. And this is the original and nature of a Tyranny, which (if we believe <hi>Plato</hi>) ever ariſes out of a <hi>Democracy.</hi>
               <note place="margin">De repub. Dialog. <hi>8.</hi>
               </note> But in a well ſetled <hi>Monarchy,</hi> the fore-mentioned diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and corruptions of manners are not ſo often occaſioned; Arts are
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:56873:74"/>
more encouraged and eſteemed, obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and order punctually obſerved; men better reſtrained from naughty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and not ſo much inclined to pernitious Arts. Among other cauſes we may 4. reckon Company, and 5. Example, eſpecially of great men, whoſe practice is thought a ſufficient warrant for inferiors to do the like; vulgar perſons readily comply with the humors of great men, as little Wheels are regulated by the motion of the greater. Beſides 6. men incur manifeſt alterations by Age, not only in body, but in mind too: young men are generally frolick and kind heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, old men moroſe and tenacious, a covetous young man (they ſay) is a Monſter in nature; and as theſe hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors prevail in men, ſo do they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly bend their ſtudies to ſuch things as ſuit beſt with their humors. 7. Dyet is of no ſmal importance, whether we reſpect the quantity, or the quallity of it: for although our Stomach macerate the meat and turns it into the very ſubſtance of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, yet doth it not ſo ſubvert the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of it, but that of cold meats (<hi>viz</hi>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:56873:74"/>
meats of a cold quality) cold blood and humors are generated; ſo that our blood and ſpirits (by help of which we exerciſe all the operations of life, ſenſe, and underſtanding) are varied according to the diverſity of meats we feed upon; light and tenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous meats ſparingly feed upon, cannot but convey ſome perſpicuity to the Brain, and a full and groſſe diet cloud and dull the Spirits. 8. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey adminiſters much alteration, and produces manifeſt differences in this particular, Northerly people through the denſity of their blood and ſpirits are ſtern, ſtout, and fierce. The Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern having more thin <hi>evanid</hi> ſpirits become hereby more active. <hi>Iſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> becauſe of that influence a mixt and unconſtant Ayr hath upon their humors, are obſerved to be more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetled in matters of Religion and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, than ſuch as inhabit the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent.</hi> 9. Alſo particular ſcituations in the ſame Countrey are to be noted, For people that live by the Sea-ſide are more generally diſpoſed to traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick, than they of the Inland-coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey; ſuch as border upon ill neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:56873:75"/>
give their minds to quarreling, either in Suits of Law or open War. And 10. the nature of the Soil, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Ayr altered by the Soil; as we ſee, that people who live in Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanous and dry places, with a pure and clear Ayr, are for the moſt part, not alwayes, (ſome powerful cauſe may intervene) more acute, and pregnant than ſuch as live in Fenny and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh places, where they ſuck in a groſſe and <hi>concrete</hi> Ayr. 11. The <hi>Genius</hi> of the Age is not to be omitted, for ſometimes ſeem peculiarly bent to feats of Armes; in another age learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing flouriſhes; and of the parts of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, ſometimes one kind ſeems to be in faſhion, and in the next Age ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. 12. And laſtly, the ſucceſs and event of things, much alters the minds and affections of men, eſpecially the common ſort, who are eaſily cheated into a beliefe that whatſoever hath obtained ſucceſſe is lawful, and to be practiſed: So that if any wicked deſign (for example Rebellion) obtains ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe in a Countrey, it will ſoon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire reputation among the vulgar; a vein of rebellion will diffuſe it ſelf
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:56873:75"/>
into ſervants and all ſorts of inferiour people, encouraging them to ſhake off the yoke of Authority: On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, many men are reſtrained from wickedneſſe, more by obſerving the ill event that attends it, than out of any inclination to goodneſſe; many incouraged to vertue and wiſdome, Arts and Sciences only by the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and eſteem they carry in the World; the good ſucceſſe and profit that attends them. To theſe cauſes I ſhould have annexed our Parents, and Nurſes, the four Elements, and ſome other; but their efficacy is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernable by what hath be ſaid concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the reſt. As for the four humors and Complexions (to which all men are uſually reduced) it is ſufficient to ſay that the Sanguin are ſpritely and active in the exerciſes of the mind; except there be a ſuperfluity of blood, for that makes men dul and heavy. The Cholerick are prompt and haſty. The Flegmatick lazy and unready. The Melancholick reſerved, and commonly underſtand more than they can readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly utter.</p>
            <p>To put every one upon that imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:56873:76"/>
he moſt affects, and to which his particular <hi>Genius</hi> inclines him, (which was deſigned and much promoted by <hi>Euphorbus</hi> the Preſident of <hi>Entaphia</hi>) is a work very beneficial; for it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be convenient for a Nation, either that perſons unfit ſhould be deſigned to ſerve their Country as Schollars, or that one man ſhould engroſſe divers employments, and undertake the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctick part of ſeveral Arts, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps have no alliance with (or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon) one another. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon obſervation diſcovers what miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheifes ariſe in a ſtate, what diſgrace accrues to learning, when divers emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhallow fellowes drive a trade in the moſt noble Sciences; which might have been more ſerviceable to their Country in inferior Trades, all which are uſeful in their degree, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly to be reſpected; but becauſe they fall within the reach of every or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary capacity, and fitteſt for ſuch as aim only at mean and contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble deſignes, the purchaſing of wealth and their private content, that care not for the improving the faculties of
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:56873:76"/>
the ſoul, and raiſing it above the pitch of ſenſe.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Mechanical</hi> Profeſſions and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures, he commonly adviſed that the Son ſhould be brought up to his Fathers profeſſion, if nothing had occaſioned him to diſlike it. But if Parents had reſolved before hand upon a profeſſion for their Child, (wherein all Parents think themſelves wiſe enough to be their own guides) then he gave order that occaſion ſhould be taken to acquaint him with ſome paſſages tending that way, ſo as the frequent meditation of them might beget a liking and prepare him by degrees for it. The exterior viſage afforded but ſmal help to this diſcovery of Childrens wits, being of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes no ſufficient ſurety to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant the ingenuity of the mind; it is confeſt that the perturbations and affections of our minds are diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with ſome probability by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine extant motions, and obvious repreſentations which they make in the Veines and Muſcles of the

Further ſome by compar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the various Figures and Poſtures of mens countenances with thoſe of Beaſts, thence conclude an alliance in their natures and diſpoſitions: thus a broad Breſt, great Shoulders, Sterne look, hair curled towards the end, and glaring eyes, argue a man fierce and hardy as a Lyon: and it's uſual to ſay of ſuch a one, he looks like a Lyon: he that hath a demiſs countenance,<note place="margin">Jo. Bapt. Portae Phiſiog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom: human: lib. 1.</note> and fixt eyes, with the ball of the eye ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what broad, we call him a Sheeps-head, as being of a tame and humble nature. One that reins in his neck, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with an erect and lofty head, we probably conclude him to be proud,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:56873:77"/>
ſtately and contemptuous as the horſe; a prying ſharp countenance argues one wily and ſubtil as a Fox, eſpecially if there be alſo a reſemblance in the Eyes, which give the ſureſt judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment concerning the affections of the mind, and are cheefly to be regarded in theſe conjectures. But to diſcover by the countenance mens manners, is a thing that cannot be done with any certainty, much leſſe their aptneſs or ineptitude to learning, leaſt of all their particular propenſities to this or that Art; becauſe many bely their Phiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ognomy, cancel thoſe promiſes to which nature hath ſet her hand in their countenances, ſo that (as the proverb ſaies) their good faces were ill beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on them; others whoſe rude and ill favoured lineaments of body might preſage ſome obliquity in manners, or dulneſſe of capacity; by education, ſtudy &amp; converſing with wiſe men, waſh away the ſpots and ſtains naturally incident to their temper. For whereas three things conduce to the making of a man compleat, Nature, Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Example: where the firſt is deficient, the other may fix deep im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:56873:78"/>
of vertue upon the mind, to which if practice be added it produces a real habit, and cuſtome becomes a ſecond nature. But from the manners and behaviour of Children pregnant conjectures may be raiſed concerning their wits, therefore he earneſtly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved whether a Boy were courteous or moroſe, honeſt or given to cheating, juſt or partial, which may be diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by putting him into an Office, though but Monitor in a School: in theſe particulars notwithſtanding, he cautelouſly diſcerned, whether they proceeded from nature, or were acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: eſpecially he obſerved how one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved himſelf when angry, nature irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated will bewray it ſelf in the moſt recluſe minds. In their ſtudies he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved whether they were vigorous or remiſs, cheerful or drowſie, ſpeedy or ſlow; In their carriage whether they were bold or modeſt, in their apparel whether ſpruce or careleſſe: and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in their play whether they expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a dexterity and ingenuity in it, or were blunt and unready: from all which put together, many uſeful mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may be collected; though many
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:56873:78"/>
men cannot obtain of themſelves ſo much humility as to condeſcend to the obſervation of ſuch mean things.</p>
            <p>To learn a Language in a ſhort ſpace, to remember Stories and Tales, to be ready in anſwering queſtions, which one hath been formerly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with, are arguments of a good memory.</p>
            <p>They which excel in the faculty of Imagination, ſoon learn to write fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, no draw intricate flouriſhes and Pictures: are cunning in childiſh Architectures, and Carving: play readily at any game, delight in ſpruce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, love to be praiſed, and are ſoon ſurpriſed with admiration.</p>
            <p>But to reſolve a ſtrange and new queſtion, to render a pertinent reaſon, to delight in ſerious matters, to love Meditation, Solitude and Retiredneſs, are probable inſtances of a ſolid judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Such are likewiſe modeſt, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe in wearing their apparrel, (at leaſt not fantaſtical in it) and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly appear very unready at play and Toyes.</p>
            <p>But two things he chiefly uſed whereby to aſſiſt his diſcovery.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:56873:79"/>1. When a Child was advanced to ſome competent diſcretion, he demanded of him what Calling he cheefly deſired, and upon what grounds? If he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved his affection to any Art procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not ſo much from appetite as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, not becauſe he obſerved ſuch a man of that Calling to live in ſplendor and wealth; but that he was moved to it by the peculiar bent and inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his mind; then he eſteemed his anſwer as prophetical, aſſuredly concluding, that an earneſt affection, and impetuous inclination to any Art ſeldome proves unſucceſsful. If he judged him fit for any learned Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, then 2. he propounded ſome material queſtions in ſeveral Sciences, in ſuch plain and familiar termes as fitted a Childs capacity, obſerving wherein he gave the beſt account: or elſe he repreſented the nature of them in ſhort axioms and propoſitions, to which if he gave a ready aſſent, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be taken with them, and could out of his own notions ſomewhat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large upon them, It was not to be doubted but that he might attain that Science which he could ſo readily
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:56873:79"/>
apprehend. Truth is of a marvellous winning nature, and invites one to correſpond with it though he never heard it before, and therefore the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental principles of Arts win be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief with moſt men; but now when a very youth not only grants ſuch a thing to be true, (which is not much to be regarded in this matter) but is marvellouſly affected and taken with it, ſupplies and makes up more than the words import, by his own ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, <gap reason="illegible: blotted" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd gives ſome reaſon of his ſo doing; this turns our conjecture into a certainty, at leaſt ſuch a certainty as can be attained concerning future things. And becauſe this is a materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al point to know the grounds upon which the cheif Sciences (at leaſt) depend, before we can arrive at a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect diſcovery how and by what fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of the ſoul they are attainable: See a very breef account of ſome of them; and firſt concerning the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God.</p>
            <p>If we attentively and with delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion conſult our own thoughts, we ſhal meet with this primary and origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal truth, that 1. There is a <hi>God</hi>; a
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:56873:80"/>
propoſition naturally imprinted in the mindes of men, as it appears even by the univerſal conſent of all Nations, not excepting thoſe who are remote from the civiliz'd part of the world; If we recollect the thoughts that attended us in our Infancy, when our minds were not tincted with any corrupt opinion, we may remember that the bended Knees, and earneſt invocations we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved others to uſe, ſuggeſted ſome apprehenſions of a Divine power, ſome inviſible Agent whoſe help w<gap reason="illegible: blotted" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> ſtood in need of; and if one ſhould goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to raze out this thought, to bribe and corrupt his mind into a contrary perſwaſion, he would find his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience very tenacious and reſolute in bearing witneſſe to the truth.</p>
            <p>I ever thought that the teſtimony of mens conſciences was the moſt ſubſtantial argument to evince the truth of this firſt maxim,<note place="margin">Ren. Des Cartes medit. 3. de prima Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoph.</note> and am ſince confirmed in this opinion, becauſe I find it to be the only argument uſed by a moſt acute Philoſopher of this Age, though obſcurely (as one may ſay) illuſtrated by him with Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſical terms; the ſum of whoſe diſcourſe amounts to thus much; that
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:56873:80"/>
reflecting earneſtly upon his own mind, he finds an <hi>idea</hi> or notion of a being intirely-perfect: now of whatſoever we have ſuch a notion it is neceſſarily conſequent, that the ſame muſt exiſt, not that our <hi>Idea</hi> or notion cauſes its exiſtence; but its exiſtence is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of our notion of it, and that not in poſibility but reality: To ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt in poſibility only agrees not with the nature of that which is moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, becauſe to ſuch an exiſtence there's ſomewhat wanting, <hi>viz.</hi> real exiſtence: ſo that in the very notion &amp; <hi>Idea</hi> of a nature wholy-perfect a rea exiſtence is neceſſarily included.</p>
            <p>If this propoſition ſeems latent in ſome mens minds, (as it happens to ſuch as ſeldom or never converſe with their own thoughts) it may be exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in them and confirmed in others: 1. By obſerving the wonderful frame and Fabrick of the World in general, and the curious contrivance of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particular body: It's granted by all men that lay any claim to reaſon, that the particular bodies of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe (conſidering them in the ſtate they do enjoy) were made of ſome prae-exiſtent matter, which certainly
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:56873:81"/>
could not digeſt its ſelf into the ſhape of a Plant, Mineral, or living creature, no more than a heap of ſtones and mortar can erect themſelves into the ſhape of an Houſe, or a multitude of Letters by any fortuitous concuſſion digeſt themſelves into a complete Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence; therefore we muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that this firſt matter was regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>d and put into motion by a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme and primary Agent. 2. Some again are confirmed in this truth by conſidering the erection and conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Empires: and on the other ſide, the ſtrange methods of ſubverting them in deſpite of all the counter-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances of men.</p>

By obſerving that natural bodies being reſtrained &amp; limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to uniformity in their motions and actions, ſometimes make an excurſion beyond their ordinary bounds, and act beyond themſelves, whereby it appears that they are ſubdued to yield obedience to a ſupreme Agent.</p>
            <p>If the Opinion that there is no God hath committed a Rape upon ſome mens judgements, thoſe perſons are ſo few, that it is no prejudice to this firſt propoſition. 1. Some perverſe men, out of a bravery of ſpirit, or a fond deſire to become the talk of the World after their deaths, have wran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled about it, and made it a diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble point. 2. Others, to acquire a full complacency and freedom in their beloved pleaſures, or the reſolute ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying of their mindes in ſome vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent paſſion, have peradventure at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to deceive themſelves as much as they could, and to imagine there
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:56873:82"/>
was no God; leſt the fear of him ſhould abate the eagerneſs of their deſires which they laboured to ſharpen, to the end they might ſecurely attempt that to which their affections promp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them. 3. An interrupted fruition of all things deſired may choak the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural notions concerning God in ſome men, and ſuperinduce a forgetfulneſs of him. 4. Perpetual and ſordid Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty without any viciſſitude and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of competency and content, ſtarves the thoughts of God in many abject and low ſpirits, which crave the taſte of indulgent goodneſs. 5. Many ſtumble and perplex themſelves with doubts by obſerving the meanneſs of pious men, and ſucceſs of wickedneſs, and the like inequalities of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; for, though it be a certain truth, that Piety is ſucceſsful, and Wickedneſs unhappy; yet common experience and obſervation objects, that pious men (at leaſt ſo reputed) are oft-times miſerable and unhappy, prodigiouſly wicked men, Murderers, Tyrants, and irriligious perſons live in ſplendor and wealth, to a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent age, and ſometimes die in their
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:56873:82"/>
beds of a natural death in great quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of mind. To undeceive our ſelvs, and reſcue us from the injury theſe Obſervations do to the truth, It may be ſafely affirmed that the infelicity of pious men is laid upon them either as a means to render their patience, and other Virtues more conſpicuous, or elſe as a puniſhment for ſome crime, which though men have not obſerved, yet God, who purſues ſin through paths not adverted by us, will be ſure to chaſtiſe men for evil doing. But then the proſperity of wicked men puzzles us far more; to ſay that God raiſes them up on purpoſe to expoſe them to a more remarkable ruine, doth not fully take away the doubt; for, beſides that it ſeems to argue a kinde of envy and fury in the courſe of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence; the event of things doth not alwayes favour this aſſertion: The ſafeſt way to reſolve it is this, that God who made all men obligeth himſelf to maintain all indifferently; to the beſt he affords the beſt bleſſings, Virtue, Wiſdom, a competency of all things with contentedneſs, a good name in their life and after death:
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:56873:83"/>
If to vitious men he allowes honour and wealth, victory and proſperity, it may be for ſome good which he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves in them, and which he will bleſs wherever he findes it: or elſe to bring about ſome remarkable work, as the puniſhing and plaguing of a Nation, for which the worſt of men are the fitteſt Inſtruments; or the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing ſome other deſign, to which this ſeeming irregularity in provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence may conduce, although it be not eaſie for men to diſcover it. 6. And laſtly, the abſurd and diſhonorable abuſes which many that lay a great claim to Religion put upon God, may cauſe ſome unſettled ſpirits to reject Religion its ſelf, and become <hi>Atheiſts.</hi> The World is often peſtred with ſuch Vermine, as being about to commit ſome huge piece of impiety, ſome hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Villainy, which in its proper co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours would affright the people, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe it very ſprucely with a Vizard of Holineſs, and recommend it to the unwary multitude under the notion of a pure religious work, tending to the intereſt of Religion, and advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Godlineſs; by which means
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:56873:83"/>
Religion its ſelf, the moſt illuſtrious ornament of mankind (when rightly uſed,) is ſometimes made an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to undo them.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Maxim in natural The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ology is, That there is one God; nor hath this met with ſo much contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the World as ſome may ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine; for although the magnifying of benefits received from Creatures, the inordinate love to ſome things, or fear of others, may have cauſed men to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain reverend thoughts of (and pay a kind of adoration to) them; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as not only renowned men, but ſeveral ſorts of Beaſts, Birds, and Fiſhes have been worſhipped: and a numerous generation of Deities ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded upon the faith of a credulous World, yet the wiſeſt part of men have in all Ages acknowledged onely one God.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Nature informs us that God manages all theſe inferior things by his Providence: and 4. That he is to be worſhipped, every Nation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtudious to preſcribe Rules, and inſtitute ſome ſuch ſignificant and powerfull Ceremonies, as might heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:56873:84"/>
their affections in their religious ſervices. Thus far Nature guides men in this Science concerning God; theſe Propoſitions a man may make out by retiring into himſelf, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into a right poſture of Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. What propoſitions are over and beſide theſe, are either conſequences drawn from theſe, or the dictates of Faith.</p>
            <p>Such as take upon them to aſſert and maintain points of Divinity, and to confute Oppoſers; that ſearch into the grounds and cauſes of things, infer, diſtinguiſh, and draw concluſions, have need of a ſollid judgement and much diſcurſive learning. But to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold &amp; deliver precepts to the people is a work accompliſhed by the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and imagination, ſo that many who have no great depth of judgement taking ſuch aſſertions upon truſt as they find delivered by others, order and contrive them into a method, according to their fancy, offer them to the people with fluent perſwaſive expreſſions, a pleaſing elocution, and winning geſtures: whereby they erect to themſelves the ſame power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:56873:84"/>
Orators, becauſe the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple (who are the greateſt part of men) are more affected with the ſpeech and exterior preſence of a man, than with his reaſons: a confident affirming of any thing prevails more with them than a demonſtration. The dictates of Faith find admiſſion ſooneſt into the minds of ſuch men as are of a tracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Modeſt, and Obedient temper, free from curioſity, prejudice, ſelf-conceit and pride.</p>
            <p>The Principles by which <hi>Moral</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are guided, are not to be found ſo ſincere among the ſpruce &amp; polite Nations, whoſe judgements through cuſtome, ſelf-love, or ſome other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centive, are eaſily perſwaded to call that a dictate of reaſon, which makes for their own pleaſure or advantage, as among the poor naked <hi>Barbarians,</hi> among which we may ſuppoſe one, neither illuminated by an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary indulgence of Divine Grace, nor depraved by perſuing of any baſe ends. Such a one limits his actions ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to theſe few Rules. 1. I muſt indeavour to preſerve my ſelf, &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I cannot do this, unleſſe I be in
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:56873:85"/>
a league and hold community with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men (every particular mans pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation being wrapt up and includ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the general concernments of mankind) Therefore 2. I muſt nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate a free commerce, and traffick with others indifferently; and in the managing thereof, 3. Deal with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers as I deſire they ſhould deal with me. To extend the Rule of ſelf-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation ſo far, as that by vertue thereof every man ſhould claim what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever might make for his emolument, and ſeek to cut others ſhort, would be as erronious as dangerous; for if I aſſume ſuch a Latitude of power to my ſelf, and deny it to others, I am not onely unjuſt, but by arming my ſelf againſt all men, arme all men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me. If I allow it to all men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently, I goe about to deſtroy humane ſociety, and therein my ſelf, by inſtructing men to prey upon one another, and me among the reſt: ſo that inſtead of ratifying, this would diſannul the firſt &amp; grand law of ſelf-preſervation. 4. I muſt maintain peace with all men. 5. Be courteous to all men. 6. Accomodate others as far as
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:56873:85"/>
may ſtand with convenience. 7. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme Covenants. 8. Gratify others for curtiſies received. 9. Pardon any man that hath injured me, upon his ſubmiſſion and ſufficient caution for the future. 10. Preſerve my ſelf in ſuch a ſtate of mind and body, by curbing my paſſions &amp; intemperances, that I may not be deprived of the uſe of reaſon. Theſe Rules (by what hath been ſaid) will eaſily appear to be not onely conſiſtent with the Law of ſelf-intereſt and preſervation, but ſo interwoven with it, that without theſe that cannot be in force: and though theſe Rules be general, yet from them may be derived punctual directions to guide men in the carrying on of all particular affairs; for, if the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding be rightly ſeaſoned with theſe, the Inclinations and Motions of the Will preſently become tractable and obedient.</p>
            <p>The knowledge of right and wrong is natural to all men, it is as regent o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all our actions. I grant it is very often uſurped upon by factious paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by corrupt opinions which men unwarily admit, and ſuffer themſelves
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:56873:86"/>
to be governed by them. Yet I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that he that is profeſſedly wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, if he allows himſelf any leiſure to conſider what he doth, cannot commit an evil action without ſome diſſatisfaction and reluctancy; but his unhappineſs is, that being tranſported and prepoſſeſt with a corrupt paſſion, or opinion, he furiouſly purſues that which his appetite deſires, and admits not any leiſurable arguing or delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, as the vertuous man doth; who when any thing reducible to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice holds his mind in ſuſpence, and incumbers it with difficulty, frames in his thoughts the contradictory to it, making two practical propoſitions; this is lawfull. It is not lawfull: which being contradictory, cannot both be true; he examines them judiciouſly and warily, diſtinguiſhes which is to be aſſerted, which rejected. Or (as ſome obſerve) there is a Syllogiſm contrived in mens thoughts. All vice is to be avoided; This is a vice, Then it is to be avoided. A vertuous man concedes the whole Argument. An incontinent, or wavering man, grants the <hi>major</hi>; but being placed in a
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:56873:86"/>
middle ſtate between virtue and vice, is unreſolved in the <hi>minor.</hi> A deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately wicked man regards neither, his furious appetite prevents all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions his reaſon would collect from the premiſſes.</p>
            <p>Although I made a ſuppoſition, that the principles of morality were to be found moſt ſincere among the ſimple and illiterate, yet relating the qualifications of an exact morall man; one ſhall be, that he be of good parts, well bred, and have a ſolid judgment: for ſuch a one will manage his actons according to the rules of Reaſon, more dexterouſly and judiciouſly, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them with more advantage and ſplendor. 2. Then it is required that he have a command over himſelf, be able to ſubdue his paſſions, and make them ſtoop to his Lure. Freedome from all paſſions is a ſtate of mind not attainable, and (if it could be attained) uſeleſs and unſerviceable. Paſſions are of themſelves things indifferent, unreſtrained they diſturb the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the mind, and put men out of courſe, by repreſenting various ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects under the notion of good or bad,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:56873:87"/>
pleaſant or unpleaſant; the ſoul up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the apprehenſion thereof is ready to move the bloud and ſpirits raſhly and diſorderly: inſomuch as the light of Reaſon is obſtructed and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed, and the Actions of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding become irregular. As Vapours in a full ſtomach fume into the head, diſorder the viſive ſpirits, and produce error in the ſight: but prudently managed, they become ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable and advantagious. Anger may make a man heroick, valiant and hardy. Joy adds ſpeed and reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and inforces a man oft-times to go beyond himſelf in diſpatch of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs. Fear and grief (though they ſeem to be ſluggiſh and unactive) may ſometimes do a Curteſie by making men circumſpect and wary: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a kind of fear ariſes from an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuperable neceſſity, or huge danger, that wings the Reſolution, and begets courage; neceſſity of action quickens the ſluggiſh ſpirits, enforces a man to volour and eloquence, and makes him ready to attempt any enterprize. Meer neceſſity makes ſome men active, and Deſpair its ſelf begets Hope.

Love widens and inlarges the minde, inclines men to do favours and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, from which flowes the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt pleaſure that can be. Ambition and love of honour, (though often ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant in compaſſing its ends) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines men to gallantry of ſpirit, to hate baſeneſs, to be mercifull to Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliants.</p>
            <p>The Law of Nature is a Rule re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting from the light of Reaſon, and directs men in the managing of their actions, eſpecially as they are Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of a Common-wealth; and being written with indelible characters in their mindes, invites them to corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpond with ſuch poſitive humane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions as are agreeable to it. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick and municipial Laws are but as a Commentary upon this original Law, and the more conformable they are to that, the more free reception they meet with among men.</p>
            <p>It commands 1. Self-conſervation; and 2. Multiplication of the kind. 3. Equality to be allowed among men. 4. That God is to be worſhipped.
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:56873:88"/>
5. Good to be choſen, evil to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided. 6. A greater good to be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen before a leſs. 7. Parents to be honoured. 8. That we ought to deal by others as we deſire to be dealt by. 9. That we reſtore things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to our truſt. And 10. Deſire peace and reſt. 11. That we uſurp not the privilege of being our own Judges. 12. That we be ready to pardon And divers other Rules which a man may collect by Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. There is in the mindes of all men, not brutiſh, a Rule of Reaſon, which avouches what is good, what bad: what is right and wrong; for Humane Laws do not define or decree that; neither can they. A Tyrant may conſtrain men by perverſe Laws, to do that which is unjuſt; but he cannot conſtrain them to judge and eſteem that which is unjuſt to be juſt, that freedom they will have in diſpite of him.</p>
            <p>Could this law of nature be univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally received and obſerved, it might ſufficiently ſecure the Peace and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of men; but in regard that paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:56873:88"/>
and error overſway reaſon, and wreſt the dictates of natures Law, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing them to ſerve baſe ends; and ſo long as men are what they are, men; theſe corruptions and exorbitances cannot but obtain: Leſt ſome men under a pretence of the law of Nature ſhould incroach upon too great a power to the prejudice of others who could be content with a calmneſſe and moderation to be ruled by reaſon: Therefore to ſecure the general quiet, men put themſelves under the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of humane Lawes, which as occaſion ſerves, abridge and reſtrain the law of Nature. For Example, whereas Nature teaches and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands ſelf-preſervation, and propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the kind: If one man goes about (under a colour of ſufficiency and proviſion for himſelf) to defraud and deſtroy others; it is thought fit to conſult for the good of the whole body politick, by cutting off ſuch a dangerous member: Nature teacheth us to do no leſſe in the natural body. Nature allowes equality among men, but they have found it convenient and neceſſary to decline from this rule,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:56873:89"/>
and for their more commodious coha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation and government, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that one man ſhould be inveſted with a greater ſhare of Sovereignty than the reſt. It is agreeable to the law of Nature, that a thing committed to my charge ſhould be reſtored upon demand; But if I receive a Sword from a man, who afterwards in a fury or rage ſhould demand it; and (I ſtrongly perſume) with an intent to kill an other; ſhould I deliver it, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to gratify Nature by obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her law, I ſhould become acceſſary to the breach of another law, and commit a greater injury. So that it is neceſſary ſometimes to reſtrain the generality and latitude of the law of Nature, by humane Lawes; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of infinite variety and number ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to ſeveral Countries and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of government, it will not be required that I ſhould ſpeak any more concerning them upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.</p>
            <p>Thoſe that deal in the Lawes, are Law-makers, Judges, Pleaders, Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates, Solliciters, and the like, in a Law-maker; (leaving all controverſies
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:56873:89"/>
concerning the power of enacting Lawes, the extent of them when en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted, the concerment of the people in their enacting, or the repealing of them, and the like to wiſer men:) I think it ſufficient to ſay, that he be judicious, and impartial: Humane Lawes ſhould be fitted to the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution &amp; temper of the people, with a regard had to the circumſtances of times and places, to penetrate into which requires a reaching judgement: nor ought there to be any gratifying of particular men, Parties, or Factions in the making of Lawes: the puniſhing of men for averſneſſe in opinion, or diſaffection to ſuch a party, which hath been owned among ſome divided States, hath more of peeviſh cruelty than prudent caution in it. A Judge ſhould enjoy a good memory and underſtanding, for he muſt not only know the particular Lawes, but be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to interpret them, and know which particular law will decide and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine every Caſe that is brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him; that he ought to be of competent age and gravity, free from partiality, covetouſneſſe, and paſſion,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:56873:90"/>
every one will imagine young men fall ſhort of that experience and maturity of judgement, which are the products of age, therefore they who bring the election of Judges and other Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, within the compaſſe of Rules, admit not of any to Offices of ſuch high concernment until above 30 years of age. Such elegant perſons as talk finely, complement fluently, and delight altogether in ſpruceneſſe, (uſually called pretty men) are of all other moſt unfit for Government and Magiſtracy; where gravity is ſo requiſite. Nor ſhould he ſuffer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be carried aſide by friends and relations, peculiar inclination to ſuch a Perſon or faction, and Sympathy of affection: nor ought he on the other ſide to fear a prevailing party, or ſuffer any ſpiteful humor inſenſibly to ſlip into his mind, whereby he may be induced to ſtrain his judgement, palliate or aggravate a crime, and ſway the ballance of juſtice beyond its courſe, for he ought to be impartial. And though in criminal cauſes it be ſaid, that without anger a Judge can never puniſh home; yet to be peeviſh
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:56873:90"/>
and froward, to have returnes of manſuetude or ſeverity, as a humor may be predominant, to doom a poor wretch to death in his thoughts before tryal, becomes not a perſon of ſo high an Office, a Pleader is not permitted to fix an interpretation upon the Law, but it is requiſite that he be well read in the particular Lawes, and know whence an argument may be drawn, pertinent to his Clients cauſe, and therefore ſhould be dignified with a good memory.</p>

perſons and men of ready expreſſions though their addreſſes be pleaſing, yet they gain not authority without a temperature of gravity; and becauſe the frequency of the moſt ſplendid object blunts the eyes, and begets a leſſe eſteem in ſuch as behold them, therefore ſome caution is uſed by pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Magiſtrates in this particular; though they be never ſo humble and courteous, yet they will ſometimes take ſtate upon them, and be at a convenient diſtance, when they pleaſe to appear abroad, they carry it out with a becoming magnificence, but are not laviſh of their preſence; they are quick in diſpatch when the matter is ready for action, but cautelous and circumſpect, yielding to occaſions and emergent obſtacles; and therefore to a compleat Magiſtrate a good judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is required.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Warre</hi> two things are conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but ſeldome concur in one man, Valour and Policy: Such as are of an high implacable ſpirit, ſtout in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining their reputation, blunt in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, careleſſe in their garb, and (if
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:56873:91"/>
a negative may be admitted) of no deep underſtanding, (a thing imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent in the heat of a battle) are fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt for combate, and down-right va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. But they that are ſubtle in fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſting and contriving, peculiarly cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in miſchief, cloſe in concealing their deſigns, ſpeedy in execution, and provident to foreſee and prevent what may happen; are beſt for ſtratagems. Men indued with ſuch a kind of wit, are by the common people called luc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ky: becauſe they diſerne not the means and waies by which they bring their deſigns about, and therefore when they ſucceed, aſcribe all to For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune: Whereas wiſe men admit of no other fortune, beſides Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and mens indeavours.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hiſtory</hi> waites and attends upon Government, and the affairs of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: they that deal with it, are either ſuch as read and relate without any further aime, or ſuch as write; to the firſt a great memory is all that is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; but the other ſhould enjoy a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrating judgement, by vertue whereof they may be able to diſcover
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:56873:92"/>
the Motives, Occaſions, and Grounds of every deſign, by what Agents and means it was managed, the event and ſucceſſe of it, with an impartial vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of the truth, nor ſhould a dexterous imagination be wanting, to adorn the matter with a good ſtile, a great grace to Hiſtory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Logick</hi> is an Art which inquires into, (and judges of) Truth; the firſt ſtep to this inquiſition is a right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of ſingle notions and names; and therefore Logicians bound and confine things under certain gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral heads, called by them <hi>Praedicables</hi> and <hi>Praedicaments</hi>; to the end that no <hi>aequivocation</hi> may draw the mind to a double meaning, and bring men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an error; our thoughts are ſubject to waver, and frame looſe apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of things: but the reducing of things to a right <hi>ſeries</hi> and ranck, fixes and reſtraines them. Next, the mind joynes ſingle notions, and thereof frames propoſitions, which are either true or falſe; true, when ſuch things are compoſed whoſe nature admits of a compoſition, ſuch things ſevered
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:56873:92"/>
whoſe natures diſagree: falſe, when the contrary is done. To diſcover when a propoſition is true or falſe; 1. Let a man take the contradictory to it, ſo he ſhall have two propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; whereof one muſt be true the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther falſe: after a ſerious and leiſura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble comparing of them together, (if he be not void of that which they call natural <hi>Logick</hi>) reaſon wil inſtruct him to reject one, &amp; admit the other. Or 2. Let him turn the propoſition into a queſtion: for example; Whether In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance be hurtful? This queſtion hath two parts; firſt the <hi>Subject,</hi> or thing it ſelf concerning which the queſtion is made, that's intemperance: and ſecondly the <hi>Praedicate,</hi> or that which is attributed to it, namely to be hurtful: Then to aſſiſt his diſcovery he muſt aſſume a third or middle term; which may be this, to impair the health, and joyne it firſt with the <hi>Praedicate</hi>; thus, Whatſoever impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the health is hurtful; next with the <hi>Subject</hi>; Intemperance impareth the health: So finding the <hi>Subject</hi> and <hi>Praedicate</hi> to agree in a third or middle terme, in imparing the health; the
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:56873:93"/>
concluſion offers its ſelf; Therefore In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance is hurtfull. The reaſon of the conſecution is this, Whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver things agree in one third, agree alſo in themſelves. Whatſoever parts of a Propoſition agree in the <hi>middle terme,</hi> agree alſo in the concluſion: Whatſoever may be affirmed concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning an univerſal, may be affirmed concerning all particulars that are contained &amp; comprehended under it. Intemperance and Hurtfull agree in a third, in impairing the health; therefore they agree in themſelves; they may be combined together in the premiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, therefore they may be joyned in the concluſion. If I may ſay in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral whatſoever impayreth the health is hurtful, I may truly affirm ſo much of Intemperance in particular, becauſe it is comprehended in the number of thoſe things which impair the health. If one would inquire the truth of this propoſition, whether Pleaſure be mans cheefe felicity? let him (to promote his inquiry) ſelect a convenient <hi>middle terme,</hi> let it be permanent; and the diſcurſion may run thus; all true fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity is permanent; Pleaſure is not
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:56873:93"/>
permanent; Pleaſure then is not true felicity: Pleaſure and felicity agree not in being permanent, therefore the concluſion ſevers them; the reaſon of the conſecution here is, that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever things diſagree in the third, or <hi>middle term,</hi> diſagree in themſelves. Or, 3. A Propoſition may be put into a disjunctive form, wherein two things being layd down, to which a third cannot be added, if an Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Negation paſs upon one of them, the other is exempted: or, if more than two, they being fully enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merated, an Affirmation or Negation attributed to one exempts the reſt: as he that preciſely affirms a thing to have been done in the day, exempts the night. He that of the four parts of the year exempts Spring, Summer, and Harveſt, muſt needs mean Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>This is all that I conceive needfull for diſcovering the nature of Logick, in order to this deſign: for I take not upon me to give an exact account of any Art. The works that a <hi>Logician</hi> hath to do, are, 1. to reduce every thing to its due <hi>ſeries:</hi> 2. to define,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:56873:94"/>
or compriſe the nature of a thing in apt and pertinent terms. 3. To com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe things which admit of compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſever ſuch as diſagree; whence Truth or Falſity reſult, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as this operation is well or ill performed. 4. From ſome propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions probable or granted, to deduce ſomething that is diſputable. To the two firſt a quick and clear fancy is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite; to the ſecond and third a good judgment, and a minde ſetled, which is ever moſt advantagiouſly prae-diſpoſed to this art: and he that proves a cloſe Student at it, if it find him not ſo, it will help to make him ſo. <hi>The ſtudy of Arts is the culture of the minde, and ſerves to correct the errors of our natures.</hi> The <hi>Opponent</hi> ſhould enjoy a quick invention, that he may excogitate Arguments againſt his Adverſaries tenets. The <hi>Reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> ſhould have a ſolid reaching judgement, to know when an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment concludes, when not: and frame his Anſwer as occaſion requires. In the <hi>Sophiſticall</hi> part he carries the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit that can lay on tongue and wrangle, which moves the Students in coeleſtial
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:56873:94"/>
Sciences (as they call them) to ſay, that in the geniture of a Logician, <hi>Mars</hi> muſt be Lord of the <hi>Horoſcope,</hi> and view <hi>Mercury</hi> in a Trine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oratory</hi> endeavours to excite the Appetite and Will, by recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome florid and plauſible notions to the Fancy; therefore an Orator in the firſt place attempts to illaqueate the fancy to win the affections of his Auditory by an inſinuating Preface, pleaſing geſture, and inchanting lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. Then he perſpicuouſly ſtates the matter, and ſo proceeds to prove what he intends by popular Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (for conciſe and ſubtle diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations are ineffectual with the people) and that which might make againſt him, if it be not too manifeſt he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceals it: like that Painter who being to draw the picture of a man who had but one eye, concealed that blemiſh by repreſenting onely the perfect ſide of the countenance, as the poſture is in ſuch as they call half-faces.</p>
            <p>If he go about to demonſtrate the goodneſs or vileneſs of a perſon, or thing, thereby to procure liking or
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:56873:95"/>
diſliking; he deduces Arguments from ſuch qualities, or circumſtances which have contributed ſome ſhare of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation or diſcredit: the reſt he conceals by a handſome praeterition. The Country, Parents, Family, Birth, Actions, Honours, Virtues, Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature, Death, and Fame after death, are the uſual Ingredients into the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comium</hi> of a Perſon. The nature, qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, antiquity, pleaſantneſs, uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and goodneſs of things make them commendable. Exploits, or actions of men derive their glory from their lawfulneſs, utility, the occaſion of undertaking them, the manner of managing them, the time when, the place where, and motives by whoſe inſtigation they were attempted: and the contrary qualities are urged in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuperation. In which kind of <hi>Pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyricall</hi> diſcourſes, deviſed for the moſt part to procure delight, it is eaſie to obſerve of what force their cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning tranſitions, handſome digreſſions, and intermixing of acute ſentences, and pertinent ſtories, have with the people. As the fore-ſhadowing in Pictures cauſes the utmoſt Verges to
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:56873:95"/>
fall round upon themſelves, and ſo knit up in the end, that they promiſe more than we ſee; and cauſe us to diſcern ſome part to be included and folded under that ſhadowing, which by not being diſcovered is diſcovered the more: So in an Oration, when we are told, that there are many things, which for want of time cannot be recited; or, that the ſuperlative excellency (of I know not what) puts the Orator to a loſs of expreſſion; this detains our mindes in ſuſpence, and many times cauſes us to believe the matter greater than it is, or than he could otherwiſe perſwade us to believe it to be. On the contrary, when he would procure a loathing and hatred in the mindes of the Auditory, he cunningly fore-ſhadows the matter at which he darts the weapons of his <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> and tels them it is ſo hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible, ſo odious, ſo enormous, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, will not, dares not utter it. By this trick he leaves ſomewhat for their thoughts to ſupply, and raiſes their indignation to a higher pitch, than a tedious diſcourſe would do. You may imagine, that the Painter
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:56873:96"/>
who drew <hi>Agamemnon</hi> at the ſacrifice of his lovely Daughter, with a vail over his face, did not thereby con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal, but rather more clearly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſuch a poſture of inexpreſſible ſorrow.</p>
            <p>In ſwaſive and diſſwaſive diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes or deliberations, the Arguments muſt ariſe to a higher ſtrain of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and decline from the popular mode to a more ſerious compoſure; alwayes provided, that they be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated to the perſons whoſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections are to be raiſed or abated. If an Orator go about to perſwade men to the undertaking of any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploit, he tels them that it is poſſible to be atchieved, honeſt, pleaſant, and profitable: and the contrary in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading; not omitting examples and teſtimonies of learned men: For, though in natural Philoſophy and Mathematicks (where the exquiſite truth of things is ſearched out) Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments from Teſtimony, Tradition, and Example are of ſmal account: yet in Civil and humane Tranſactions they are of great weight; but with a regard had to the quality and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:56873:96"/>
of the perſon whoſe authority or example is alledged. Love is ſtirred up by an high exaltation of ſome good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſon, or thing. Hatred by ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravating the indignity of ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or action. Pitty, by opening the miſery of ſome perſon well eſteemed of by the Hearers, whoſe condition they will reſent as if it were their own; and (as occaſion ſerves) the Orator tacks about, and lies at trye, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve which way mens humors, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and inclinations move, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly ſpreads the ſails of his Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick to meet them.</p>
            <p>In Judicial proceedings, whoſe aim is to gain favour or ſeverity of juſtice, by examining matters of fact; the chief perſon of the auditory is the Judge, who being a perſon inveſted with Authority, and preſumed to be a Maſter of Reaſon, much acuteneſs, and ſolidity muſt appear in them: If the Orator aſſumes the perſon of the Accuſer, he ſums up the impulſive cauſes which might probably move the party accuſed to the commiſſion of the fact; as anger, malice, fore-thought, and formerly evidenced, occaſion,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:56873:97"/>
opportunity, hope of gain, avoiding of ſome apparent Evil; eaſie conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Conſternation, and the like, the Defendent argues from contrary <hi>Topicks,</hi> and indeavouring to refute his adverſaries Arguments, if any thing be ſo obvious, that it cannot be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by a handſome praeterition; he endeavours to diminiſh the validity of it. Unleſſe he peremptorily ſtands upon his vindication, and then he argues the fact to be Lawfull from the Law of Nature, Equitie, Covenant, Cuſtome, Example; or craves pardon, becauſe it was done involuntarily, upon neceſſity, forcible impulſion, perturbation, and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mind; which extenuating cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances have a great influence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on mens mindes, where free diſcepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions find place: but yet in ordinary legal tryals (where the bare matter of fact is conſidered) they do not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten procure favour. Above all it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry material that in all addreſſes the Orator ſhould bring into publick view a Carriage, Elocution, and Action ſuitable to his intended diſcourſe; and ſuch as may contribute a lively re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:56873:97"/>
of what he endeavers to imprint in the minds of his Auditory. In inſtructing he ought to be earneſt, grave, and ſerious, with a voice and pronuntiation ſuitable; A quick, live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and pleaſant ſtile ſooneſt moves men to joy. Sorrow is cauſed by a low paſſionate ſtile, the voice flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and interrupted; In ample mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters the diſcourſe ſhould be lofty, bold, and manly; the voice undiſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, and without artificial interrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: In mean occaſions conciſe, acute and elegant: In <hi>Panegyricks</hi> ſtately, flouriſhing, and full of ornament. In narrations clear, and perſpicuous; in asking or excuſing, modeſt and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſive; In commendations officious, and full of reſpect: In mirth and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous encounters luxuriant and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and not to nicely crampt into a method. In ſorrow and fearfulneſſe, a grave, compendious, and leiſurable ſtile is moſt pertinent; the voice low, flattering, and arteficially interrupted. Anger and Indignation requires a rough, trouble, and uneven ſtile, ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the nature of ſuch impetuous paſſions. So that an Orator ought to
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:56873:98"/>
tune and modify his voice, as a Luta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt doth his ſtrings, that it may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe all the ſeveral motions and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the mind; provided that he order the matter ſo dexterouſly as to redeem himſelf from the ſuſpition of affectation: For <hi>it is the part of an Artiſt to conceal his Art.</hi> The va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious modifications of words and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, <hi>Figures,</hi> and <hi>Tropes,</hi> whereby they are drawn from their proper meaning to a pleaſing and more em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatical ſignification, add much orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to an Oration, tickle the eares, and recreate the mindes of the hearers, through the handſome contrivance of words, and pleaſant cadences in the periods of ſentences; But if there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear a manifeſt affectation in them, they prove like womens paint when diſcovered; they deface and diſcredit while they ſeem to beautify.</p>
            <p>By this time it appears that <hi>Oratory</hi> derives its perfection from invention, Elocution and action or geſture. The firſt is advanced by help of a well ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red memory, the other come by pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, but are cheefly promoted by a bold and ſelfe-pleaſing fancy. In one
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:56873:98"/>
deſigned for an Orator, a luxuriant and ranck wit is not to be rejected, a ſuperabundance is better then defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency; trees that have ſome ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous branches are ſooner corrected, than thoſe that are dry and withered can be advanced to fruitfulneſſe. 2. His voice muſt be ſtrong, but ſo as he have a command over it, to raiſe or depreſſe it, tune it to a gentle or harſh ſtrain, a ſweet or ſevere accent, as occaſion requires. 3. He muſt be induſtrious. And 4. deſirous of praiſe, (not to ſay ambitious.) 5. Of a good preſence and perſonage. 6. Of a ſtrong conſtitution, and habitude of body. 7. Active. 8. Bold, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times the confidence of an Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate helps out the evidence, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies adds effecacy to his arguments. 9. He muſt be practiſed and trayned up in company, for we ſee, that ſuch as affect ſolitude, and addict them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves wholely to ſtudy; though they may perchance have their minds fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with ſublime notions, and refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned contemplations, wherewith they pleaſantly entertain their thoughts, and fix a period to their content, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citely
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:56873:99"/>
applauding their own felicity: yet when they come abroad, they are like people long accuſtomed to a cloſe and obſcure room, whoſe eyes are dazled at the light: A frequency of people aſtoniſhes them, overmuch ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy hath made them low ſpirited, and unfit for ſociety; they have been ſo long love-ſick with the Muſes, that they are emaſculated; become ſneak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and meal-mouthed, not couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous enough to bare the Checks and Affronts wherewith men that adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon manly imployments muſt ſometimes expect to incounter. 10. It wil be a great ornamant to him if he be facetious, of a jocular fancy, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive witty Jeſts, elegant reſemblan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, apt compariſons, Superlative ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, and ſometimes Satyricall laſhes. 11. Which is as neceſſary as any thing elſe, let him be graced with a good memory, the ſtore-houſe of words and matter. Laſt of all (but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all) he muſt be converſant (though not criticall) in all (or moſt) Arts, and material pieces of learning, whereby he may be furniſhed with plenty of matter, without which
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:56873:99"/>
his Rhetorick-pipe will make but dull Muſick, and his volubility of expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſignifie nothing; but thus accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed (as hath been ſet down,) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions cannot be wanting, but will flow in ſpontaneouſly.</p>
            <p>By <hi>Speech,</hi> we tranſmit our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, and communicate our thoughts one to another. And this is a priviledge pecular to men alone: For as much as thoſe geſtures and various accents uſed by Beaſts, which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teligible among themſelves, and ſerve to manage the negotiations where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they have to do, arrive not at the Nature and dignity of a language, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſerve to communicate only ſome few notions, or to expreſſe ſome paſſions without any regard had to circumſtances; the preſent found af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects them, (but ſo far as we can ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve) leaves no laſting impreſſion, when we attempt to advance their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage to a further improvement, as to imitate ſome of our vulgar words, that deſign arrives at no further parfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction than only to make a little ſport, as in Poppinjayes taught to warble
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:56873:100"/>
out ſome word, the ſenſe whereof they never comprehend, much leſs any diſtinct notice of the things named: When we teach a Dog to come or go at our call, or practice ſome trick at the repeating of certain words, we may obſerve, it is the briskneſſe of the pronuntiation that excites him, not the world it ſelf; for if it be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo often repeated in a calme and ſtill diſcourſe, he ſeldom or never adverts it.</p>
            <p>It is probable that in the Primative or firſt language that ever was, the words had ſome congruity with the things named; this obſervation will appear to have ſome probability, from this ſuppoſition: A man brought up from his infancy in an obſcure place, ſequeſtred from all ſociety, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards brought into company, would uſe ſome induſtry to acquaint men with his notions and conceptions of ſuch things as were preſented to his view, either by ſignes, or ſpeech; if by ſignes, he would (for example) expreſſe ſomewhat that is high by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting his eyes and hands; ſomewhat
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:56873:100"/>
that is low by raſing his hand a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle from the Earth; and ſuch like congruous ſignes. If by Speech, then would he uſe ſuch ſounds and accents as have ſome congruity with the things named: In expreſſing ſmall things, the letters <hi>e</hi> and <hi>i</hi> ſhould be moſt heard; which men even at this day ſtrive to do in ſome languages,<note place="margin">Plat. in Cratyl.</note> (and I believe in other,) as <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>brevis tenuis, minimus,</hi> litle, leettle; ſad mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters would be repreſented with the frequent ingemination of the letter <hi>m,</hi> as <hi>me miſerum! <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, hei mihi</hi>; in expreſſing ſlippery things the ſound of the letter <hi>l</hi> ſhould be of moſt force, as <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>laevis lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricus</hi>; the letters <hi>b</hi> and <hi>r</hi> in loud and violent things, as Bellowing, Brauling, Roaring, Rumbling, Tumbling, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>bombus, fragor,</hi> &amp; the like. It is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that (at leaſt) many primative words were diviſed upon this occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and diverſe radical names in the firſt language were fictitious, coined from the ſound, or ſome ſuch quality: but in deriving and compounding of words, men have ſtudied ſo much either for fineneſſe or loftyneſſe of
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:56873:101"/>
pronuntiation that they have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times added letters, and ſometimes taken them away, as beſt pleaſed their fancy; whereby it is become a matter of impoſibility to trace down words to their Original, now in this multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city and confuſion of languages, which though they be dialects one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet (as it happens in families) a long tract of time hath quite extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed all marks of their alliance, ſo as we cannot tell whence they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended. However he that would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire out the primative and ancient <hi>Idiom</hi> of any language now in uſe, he ſhall be ſure to have the beſt account from the plain Country-people &amp; wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, which being commonly confined to their homes preſerve their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage more ſincere and unmixt, than the ſpruce and Stirring part of men doe.</p>
            <p>Words (conſidering the preſent ſtate of languages) ſignifie not naturally, but arbitrarily: for beſides the conſiderable alteration that languages undergo with in the compaſs of one mans obſevation) we ſee that things of a very different
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:56873:101"/>
nature are often expreſſed by the ſame name: ſo that the minds of children being unacquainted with their double meaning, catch at that interpretation which is moſt familiar, though wrong: for inſtance, the word <hi>Church</hi> leads their thoughts to an Edifice ſo called: Hearing a Diſcourſe of Wars, Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers and Arms, they fancy ſuch Arms as belong to the body. If one ſpeak of the Acts of <hi>Alexander,</hi> their thoughts are preſently fixt upon ſome one of that name whom they know, or have heard of: and if they never heard the word before, then their Fancy ſuggeſts to them ſome word of like ſound: whence it may be infer'd, that a certain and compleat under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of a language is not attaina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, till ſuch time as cuſtom, conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, and going abroad hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd a competent knowledge of the nature and difference of things.</p>
            <p>He that deſires to learn a language onely for commerce and traffick, may ſooneſt accompliſh his deſire by imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and practice, by ingratiating himſelf with perſons of all ſorts, by
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:56873:102"/>
frequenting the company of ſuch as traffick abroad and manage buſineſſe: by this means (if he enjoy a good memory) he ſhall learn the language by degrees, and as it were unawares: &amp; be more tenacious of what he thus gains occaſionally, than if he attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to conquer it by plodding ſtudy. But he that would throughly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand and be Maſter of a language, muſt lay a ſure foundation in <hi>Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar-rules</hi> that he may throughly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the nature and differences of words, whereof ſome expreſſe perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent things, ſome denote tranſient a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and relations, ſome ſerve only to connect and join others together. This ſtudy of <hi>Grammar</hi> requires a good memory and patient induſtery; but to the commendable uſe of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage a good imagination is requiſite, which united with a ſtrong memory will inable to diſcourſe fluently, ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, and confidently concerning any ſubject: But yet ſuch men as are ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome notable for any great depth of underſtanding; but for him that would write an accurate and well compacted ſtile, ſolidity of judgement is requiſite,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:56873:102"/>
to the end that his expreſſions and ſtile may be judiciouſly ſuited to the matter in hand, in as much as every ſubject is not capable of the ſame ſtile of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, Philoſophical matters require one kind, Hiſtorical another; the ſtile of an Epiſtle muſt be different from that of an Oration.</p>
            <p>Voice is two-fold, either 1. conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued without any artificial intervals, which we call ſpeaking, Or 2. Segre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated by migrations, extentions and abatings, with convenient diſtances, and this is vocal <hi>Muſick</hi> or ſinging. The intent of <hi>Muſick</hi> is to improve the ſound or quality of words by ſome ſweet notes of voice or inſtrument, with a due regard had to meaſure, time, and prolation. Sound proceeds from motion, therfore according to the celerity or tardity of the motion, it is either ſharp or flat, according to the concord or diſcord of the Notes it is harmonious, or diſharmonious; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſpeedy returnes or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of time, (which prepare and diſpoſe the eare to receive the ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent notes) it is ſaid to conſiſt of
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:56873:103"/>
ſhort or long time. We may obſerve, that men to expreſſe ſeveral paſſions emit their breath by various degrees, making divers manners of eruption, and tune their voice to ſeveral keyes: in imitation whereof Muſick may ſeem to have been invented, and the kinds of it in old time diſtinguiſhed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to mens ſeveral paſſions, and as a ſilent eloquence was uſed to raiſe or allay them in the hearers. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently the <hi>Dorick</hi> Muſick (which had a grave and ſolemn ſtrain) was thought to excite men to prudent and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick actions, and to reſtrain them from looſneſſe and effeminate wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſſe; the <hi>Jonick</hi> meaſures were contrived to promote mirth and jol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity: and the <hi>Lydean</hi> accommodated to ſadneſs and mourning, for we muſt know, the Ayr ſmitten and modula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by voice or inſtrument, moves and affects the contiguous Ayr, this the next; till by a continued ſucceſſion it arrives at the organ of hearing; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuates and mingles its ſelf with the ſpirits of the Nerves, and ſo is traje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to the heart, where entring calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and gently it ſedates and allaies
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:56873:103"/>
the ſtirring Spirits; or briskly and with vehemence it exſuſcitates them.</p>
            <p>There are ſome (not only men but) Children which expreſſe a particular kind of acuteneſſe in imitating the ſpeeches and geſtures of others. Theſe (whoſoever will take the paines to obſerve it) will be found generally apt to learn <hi>Muſick,</hi> for that being (as was ſaid) but a kind of imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, carries an alliance with their <hi>Genius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Poetry</hi> illuſtrates the matter about which it is converſant, by words du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meaſured, and aptly joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: the original of it was only the caſting of a company of words into a kind of form and proportion; as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed all Arts at firſt were but mean trivial things; Painting no more at the firſt, but the circumſcribing the exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior limites of a body with ſingle lines, as the ſhadow thereof was project<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on a Wall: The skil of illuſtrating one part or making it more clear by the thinneſſe of the lines, another more darke by caſting a deep ſhadow on it; the dexterity of cauſing ſome parts to appear at a diſtance, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:56873:104"/>
and extenuating the lines; others at hand above the ground of the table, by making the lines eminent and bearing out; theſe knacks were added aftewards. And its probable, Poetry at its nativity only pratled out ſome harſh incompoſed verſes, in a rude method and plaine meaſure, with ſome kind of conſonancy to pleaſe the eare. And we ſee that many illiterate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and ordinary country clowns by ſtudying of conſonancies and cadencies of words accompliſh thus much: you may imagine ſome jolly poeticall ſwaine in the ſpring-time dedicating this morning Carol to his <hi>Amaryllis:</hi>

            <p>A Poem (they ſay) is a vocal picture, the meer deſigne of it is to repreſent to the Readers fancy a lively <hi>Idea</hi> or picture of the thing in cleare expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, flowriſhing elegancies, a copious and luxuriant ſtile, adventurous and lofty language: to preſent every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in his proper colours; with ſuch ſpeeches, paſſions, humors and carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages as becomes his age, ſtate, condition and temper.</p>
            <p>The Art of <hi>Poetry</hi> ſo far depends upon the ſtrength of a quick natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:56873:105"/>
wit; that (according to the true maxime) a Poet is born, not made: he that is born a Poet, may be much mended and improved by ſtudy; he that is not born with a <hi>genius</hi> fitted for it, wil never be made one. To deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in few words a peculiar and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing character of a poeticall wit: He muſt enioy a quick and ranging fancy which contrives <hi>antique</hi> fictions, imaginary <hi>Chimera's,</hi> perplexed fables, unexpected encounters; leads the reader into inchanted groves and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, builds imaginary caſtles, palaces, and a thouſand ſuch devices; he is uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſublimed up with a confident ſelfe-admiring imagination. A Poet is firſt highly inamored of his owne ingenious conceits, and that gives him the confidence to publiſh them: pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming that others will be as much taken with them as himſelf; which if it happen (as in all probability ſome that are of the ſame humor and <hi>Genius</hi> will extoll and applaud them) then he thinks himſelf a happy man, and this applauſe, if it be not the onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward he aimes at; yet it is commonly the richeſt he can catch.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="199" facs="tcp:56873:105"/>The axioms which are generally admitted in naturall Philoſophy, are chiefly theſe. 1. That all bodies, ſubſtances and motions are produced by ſome efficient cauſe, or primary a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent: whereupon the common people (who have more truth in their notions than every one obſerves, but want ſkill to diſcover it) compendiouſly reſolve themſelves concerning all the effects in nature, by ſaying that ſuch a thing happens according to the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and appointment of God; which is true, and as much as need be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from them, and a kind of arguing more allowable, than if they ſhould attribute things to fortune, chance, or ſuch kind of nothings: but a <hi>Philoſopher</hi> who thinks himſelfe obliged to give a more immediate reaſon of things, grants this to be right, as being aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that he which layes not ſuch a foundation in his method of <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,</hi> will find himſelf miſerably puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led about many apparances. Yet makes not this a ſubterfuge for igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or lazineſs, but proceeds fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: that 2. All natural bodies (as to the ſtate they now enjoy) were formed of
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:56873:106"/>
ſome prae-exiſtent matter, which to diſcover plainly hath poſed all, both ancient and modern enquiries, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced various Opinions: &amp; no marvel; for the firſt production of things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a matter ſo far out of our diſcovery; all the knowledge we can arrive at concerning it is but conjectural, and various too according to the ſeveral methods which men have uſed to ſearch it out. It hath paſſed a long time as a certain truth, that Earth, Water, Fire and Air were firſt formed and contrived out of a confuſed ſhapeleſs lump, and of theſe being variouſly tempered together, all mixt bodies reſulted. Others diving more ſcruti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſly and curiouſly into the originall of things, tell us, that the firſt matter conſiſted of minute parts and ſeveral configurations, which fortuitouſly meeting together, produced all ſolid bodies; their tenuity making them fit for mixtion, whereas craſſitude hinders their coaleſcence. Latter times have ſtill contrived more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined notions, and perſwade us that the firſt and originall matter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of particles, ſome very ſubtile,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:56873:106"/>
fluid, and capable of penetrability: ſome ſpherical, or globulous; which by their various motions, mutual col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſion, and attrition, daſht themſelves into ſeveral <hi>Schematiſmes.</hi> For they take it for granted, that the original and prae-exiſtent matter, being by the Creator made up of ſmall parts, and thoſe of various ſhapes, and put into motion: theſe parts muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily wear off their extancies and corners; that which was ſo worn off would become a ſubtil tenuious and agile matter; the reſt minute globes or ſpherical particles, the ſmaltenuious &amp; ſubtil particles being ſomwhere en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vironed and preſſed together, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ſuch figures, as the next or contiguous bodies were apt to imprint upon them. So that figures ſeem not to have been wrought in bodies by any foreconceived deſign, or intelligent aime; but only by the concurrence of accidental cauſes, and are nothing elſe but the bodies themſelves, limited by the circum-obſeſſion of other bodies from being extended beyond thoſe dimenſions they enjoy. For example, A <hi>Cube</hi> ſeems to receive its figure by
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:56873:107"/>
being equally environed on all ſides. A <hi>Lamine</hi> or thin plate by being daſht powerfully on two ſides only, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying the liberty of extention on the edges. A <hi>Spherical</hi> body either by rolling every way, by which motion all the extencies or little corners are grated off: (as it will happen in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of time, although it move in an Orb or Sphere, where every contigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous body ſeemes to be leſſe hard) or elſe by winding of many filaments into ſuch a form, as in a botome of yarn, and the like. It is certain 3. Earth, Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and Ayr are the Wombes and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacles to comprehend, nouriſh and preſerve mixt bodies. And that 4. all bodies have <hi>effluvia</hi>'s or atomes darted from them, whereby they act at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; and make a preſſion upon any other body that is within their Orb of emanation, and fit to imbibe them: and ſo the atomes or minute particles which are wafted over to us from hot bodies, heat us; thoſe of cold bodies benum us; the Nervous parts of our bodies being capable of receiving a preſſion by them. 5. That all, or moſt bodies, are Radious more or leſſe;

and that array expands its ſelf in the forme of a <hi>Pyramid</hi> whoſe baſe is in the object, and its vertical point in the eye. It is generally granted, that 6. there is ſo ſtrict a connexion and combination in the Fabrick of the World, that no vacuity or divulſion can be in the continuity of Nature; And yet 7. every compounded body hath many Cavities or pores, apt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>receive ſmal and ſubtil particles which are trajected through them; mixion is but a compoſure or juxtapoſition of parts, whoſe ſuperficies's, though they touch one another, yet their coal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſcence is not ſo cloſe, but that theſe Atomes or ſubtil parts of matter find convenient pores through which they paſſe, and by vertue of theſe it is that, 8. All bodies reſcue themſelves into their native dimenſion and figure, if they be by any overmaſtering violence compreſſed out of, or diſtracted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond it; As it is ſeen in a Bow, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in if the pores be (for example) round before the bending; by the tenſure they are crampt and preſſed into a <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical</hi> figure: but when the bow is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain unbent, theſe active particles in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:56873:108"/>
the diameter of their pores, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore them to their former round fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure; &amp; by preſſing the adjacent parts reduce the bow to its wonted figure.</p>
            <p>9. All Natural bodies are ſubject to diſſolution and corruption, yet ſo as that bodies of a different nature a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe from them: Inſomuch that if we reſpect the whole frame of nature, diſſolution and corruption of bodies imports no more than the aſſuming of a new ſhape: no annihilation ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds, but a kind of circulation in the works of Nature. For after many changes and revolutions a body may re-aſſume the ſame figure and Nature it had before: as appeares by that common inſtance of an Oxe; that feeds upon graſſe, which is converted into fleſh; this fleſh after it hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone ſome changes turnes to the Earth; and in proceſſe of time is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limed up into graſſe again.</p>
            <p>To find out the qualifications re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to a <hi>Natural Philoſopher,</hi> we may obſerve that for him that aimes at no more, but onely to underſtand what reaſons other men give of things, how they ſtate the matter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:56873:108"/>
natural effects; and ſo gives up himſelf to be guided by their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates: there's no more required but a good memory. But he that wil in good earneſt examine the truth of other mens reaſons; or ſearch out reaſons of himſelf, ſhould enjoy a peircing judgement.</p>
            <p>In health there is an exact compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of all the exterior and inward parts of the body; but in every diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe ſome diſorder or diſlocation (not of the exterior and ſuperficial alwaies, but) of ſome inward part, as Spirits, Blood, or humors: as appeares by that ſtrugling which men uſe to reſcue themſelves into a poſture of reſt, which if they cannot accompliſh by that agitation, then they have recourſe to ſuch meanes as by experience have been found conducible: For although reaſon in general inſtructs men, that a healthfull body muſt have nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments agreeable to its Nature; and that a diſeaſed body ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to its natural and healthful tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per by medicaments that enjoy a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary nature and quality to the prae-dominant humor, thereby to qualifie
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:56873:109"/>
and moderate it, that nature may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel it with more eaſe: yet the diſtinct knowledge of what things are agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and what noxious, (wherein the ſpeculative part of <hi>Phyſick</hi> chiefly conſiſts) and to aſſigne peculiar re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies to every particular diſeaſe, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout which the practical part is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant, theſe are but the products of experience; ſo that practical <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick</hi> took its firſt riſe from a bold ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturing upon remedies, which as they were obſerved to be ſucceſsfull or unlucky, were accordingly either recommended to poſterity or rejected.</p>
            <p>Now it is very certain that to gain the rules and method of curing, as they are already collected and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by Authors; the hiſtory of Plants, Minerals, and other particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars uſed in Phyſick; and the hiſtory of parts, or Anatomy of mans body are accompliſhed by the memory. But the practical part, whereby one is obliged to judge of ſignes and Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptomes, and thence to judge or prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſticate of danger or ſafty, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance or ſpeedy recovery, and from the indications of a diſeaſe to know what
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:56873:109"/>
remedies are ſuitable is a work of a ready imagination.</p>
            <p>There is a vaſt difference between the Theory of any Art, and the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of it; the firſt belongs either to memory or judgement, the laſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly to the imagination. And it is obſerved that the learnedeſt men in any faculty, who are immerſt in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, and buſy themſelves to be very knowing in all the intricacies of their Art, ſeldome prove ſo plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible in the practice, as thoſe who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting themſelves with the common and ordinary rules, (which are eaſy and ſoon learnt) apply themſelves wholely to the profeſſory and lucra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive part. This is ſeen in nothing ſo evidently as in the practice of <hi>Phyſick</hi>; (although it be true in other Arts) wherein many adventurous empiricks, and prating Mountebancks, by help of a few aſtoniſhing words and ſome experimented remedies ſoon raiſe themſelves a great fame: eſpecially if aſſiſted by the credulity of the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar and leſſe intelligent ſort of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. But one uſual engin whereby they ſcrew up their fame among theſe, is
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:56873:110"/>
their cheapneſſe; the ſureſt device to catch the common people who are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally hidebound, and ſordidly par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimonious. Sometimes (I confeſs) it fals out, that a man whom Nature meant and intended for a Phyſitian; by the iniquity of fortune, unskilfulneſſe of Parents and Tutors, or ſome other ill luck is thruſt upon a meaner profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: which being irkſome and unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to him (as it commonly happens when the natural bent and inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the mind is thwarted) afterwards following the conduct of his <hi>Genius,</hi> applies himſelfe to the Study of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, and proves more lucky at it, than many which by a tedious and charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able education have been trained up to it.</p>
