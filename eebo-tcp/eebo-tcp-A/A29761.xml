            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>In the <hi>year</hi> 1660, it was my lot, first, to apply and improve this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Contrivance of Mr. <hi>Samuel Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi> on a <hi>Quadrant,</hi> to a joynt Rule or Sector; and did, in 1661, publish my present Thoughts thereof, in a small Discourse, under the name of the <hi>Ioynt Rule.</hi>

            <p>Since then, through my perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and assistance, another Piece was published 1667, by <hi>I. T.</hi> under the name of the <hi>Semi-Circle on a Sector:</hi> But neither of these, that is to say, neither my own nor his, spoke what

            <p>So for the present, I rest and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, ready to serve you in, and supply defects by well making of these Instruments, at the <hi>Sphear</hi> and <hi>Sun-Dial</hi> in the <hi>Great Minories.</hi>

               <head>The Description thereof.</head>
               <p n="1">1. FIrst, it is a joynted Rule (or Sector) made to what Length or Radius you please, (as to 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 30, or 36 inches Length, when it is folded or shut together; the shorter of which Lengths is big enough for Land uses, or Paper draughts; the four last for Sea uses, or Observations.) To which is
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61037:10"/>
added, a third Piece of the same length of the Sector, with a Tennon at each end, to fit into two Mortice-holes at the two ends of the inside of the Sector, to make it an Aequilateral Triangle; from which shape, and its use, it is properly called a <hi>Triangular Quadrant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, as to the Lines graduated thereon, they may be more or less, as your use of them, and as the cost you will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow, shall please to command: But to make it compleat for the promised Premises, these that follow are necessary to be inscribed thereon, as in the Figure thereof.</p>
               <p>And first you are in order hereunto to consider, The outer-edges of the (Sector or) Instrument, the inner-edges, the Quadran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal-side, the Sector-side, and the third or loose-piece, also the fixed or Head-leg, the moving-leg, the head, and the end of each leg, also the head and leg center; of which more in its proper place.</p>
               <p n="1">1. And first, on the outer-edge is placed the Lines of Artificial Numbers, Tangents, Sines, and versed Sines, to as large a Radius as the Instrument will bear.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, on the in-side or edge, on short Rules is placed inches, foot measure, the line of 112, or such-like. But on larger Instruments, a Meridian line to one inch,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61037:10"/>
or half an inch (more or less) for one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of the Aequinoctial, for the drawing of Charts, according to <hi>Mercator,</hi> or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more useful Line you shall appoint for your particular purpose.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, in decribing the Lines on the two sides; first I shall speak to the Sector-side, where the middle Lines all meet at the Center at the head where the Joynt is: the order of which (went the head or joynted end lyeth toward your left hand, the Sector being shut, and the Sector-side upermost) is thus:</p>
               <p n="1">1. The first pair of Lines, and lying next to you, is the Line of Sines, and Line of Lines, noted at the end with S, and L: for Sines and Lines, the middle Line between them that runs up to the Center, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Brass center pricks be, is common both to the Sines and Lines in all Parallel uses, or entrances.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Line next these, and counting from you, is, the Line of Secants beginning at the middle of the Rule, and proceeding to 60 at the end, and noted also with <hi>Se</hi> for Secants, one of which marginal Lines con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, would run to the center as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The next Lines forward, and next the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner-edge on the moving-leg are the Lines of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61037:11"/>
Tangents; the first of which, and next to you, is the Tangent of 45, being the largest Radius, (as to the length of the Rule:) the other is another Tangent to one fourth part of the length of the other, and proceeds to 76 degrees, a little beyond the other 45: the middle Line of these also is common to both, in which the Center pricks must be. At the end of these Lines is usually set T. T. for Tangents.</p>
               <p n="4">4. On the other Leg of the Sector, are the same Lines again, in the same order counting from you; wherein you may note, That as the Lines of Sines and Lines on one Leg, are next the outward-edge; on the other Leg, they are next the inward-edge: so that at every, or any Angle whatsoever the Sector stands at, you have Lines, Sines, and Tangents to the same Radius: and the Secants to just half the Radius, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to the same Radius by turning the Compasses twice; Also any Tangent to the greater Radius above 45, and under 76, by turning the Compasses four times, as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards will more appear: Which contrivance is of excellent convenience to avoid trouble, and save time; and happily made use of, in this contrary manner to the former wayes of ordering them.</p>

               <p>IN the first place it will not be amiss to hint a few words, as to the reading the Lines, or (more properly) Numeration on the Lines; wherein take notice, That all Lines of Equal Parts, or Lines applicable to Arithmetick, as the Line of Lines, the Line of Numbers, the Line of Foot-measure, and the like; wherein Fractions of Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are requisite: they are most commonly accounted in a Decimal way, and as much as may be, the small divisions are numbred, and counted accordingly.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:61037:15"/>But in the Lines of Sines, Tangents, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants, and Chords; being Lines belonging properly to a Circle: in regard that the Sexagenary Fraction is still in use, the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Divisions are, as much as may be, fitted to that way of account, <hi>viz.</hi> by whole degrees, where they come close toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, (or the Line of no great use.) And if more room is, to half degrees or 30 minuts, and sometimes to quarters of degrees or 15 minuts; but toward the beginning of the Line of Natural Sines, or the end of the Natural Tangents and Secants: where the degrees are largest, they are divided to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very 10th minute in all large Rules, as by considering and accounting you may plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceive.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Take two or three <hi>Examples</hi> of each kind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. First, On the Line of Lines, to find the Point that represents 15. In the doing of this, or any the like, you must consider your whole Scale, Radius, or length of the Line, may be accounted as 1, as 10, as 100, as 1000, or as 10000; and no further can be applicable to any ordinary Instrument.</p>
               <p>Wherein observe, That if the whole Line be one, then the long stroke by every Figure doth represent one tenth of that Integer: and the next shorter without Figures, are
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61037:16"/>
hundredth parts of that one Integer; and a 1000th part is estimated in smaller Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and sometimes exprest in larger: But the hundredth thousand part is alwayes to be estimated by the eye in all Instruments whatsoever.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But if the whole Line of Lines shall represent 10, as it usually doth, and as it is figured, then the long stroke at every Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure is 1, and the next longer are tenths, and the shortest are hundred parts, and the thousand parts as near as can be estimated.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But if the whole Line represents a hundred, as here in our present Example, then the long stroke by every Figure repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents 10, and every shorter stroke is one, and the shortest strokes are tenths, and the hundredth parts as much as can be estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But if the whole Line shall represent a 1000, then the long stroke by the Figure shall represent a hundred, and every shor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter 10, and every of the shortest strokes is one Integer, and a 10th part as near as can be estimated.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But lastly, if the whole Line represent 10000, then every long stroke is 100, and every shortest cut is ten, and every single Integer is as near as can be estimated by any ordinary Instrument.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:61037:16"/>Now our present Example will properly come under the third Rule, by conceiving the whole Line to represent 100; then the first long stroke by 1 is 10, then the next shorter is for 11, the next 12, &amp;c. to 15; which is cut up a little above the Line, for the more ready reckoning without telling the parts: which 15 is the Point required to be found.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Example the second, to find out <hi>1550</hi> on the Line.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This will come under the Notion of the 5th Rule, wherein the whole Line is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to represent 10000; then the first 1 is for the 1 thousand, then the fifth longer stroke next is for the 500; and lastly, the middle between the 500 stroke and the 6000 stroke is for the 50, being a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Point for 15 in the first Example.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A third Example of <hi>5025.</hi>
                  </hi>

                  </gap>fice for this work, being so plain after a little due con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration: For first, the whole Line is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to represent 10000, then the long stroke by 5 is for 5000, then there is no hundreds, therefore the Point required must be short of the next longer stroke, which signifies hundreds, and being it is just 25, which is ¼ of an hundred, the true Point readily sheweth it self; If you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire

               <p>Also if it should be a Number with a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>git, two ciphers and another digit, as 2.005, this Number would be found close to the long stroke, by the figure 2: and may represent either two thousand, and 5 of 1000 more; or 20 and 5 of a hundred; or 2 hundred and 5 of another 10 more, or plainly as it is set down, two thousand, no hundred, but five: Thus you see the manner of expressing whole Numbers, or whole Numbers and Decimal Fractions, which on the Lines is one and the same thing; and thus all Decimal Scales are to be accounted, and in the same manner is
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61037:17"/>
the Line of Numbers to be read, as you may see more at large in the two Books be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned.</p>

                  <p>But for Numerateon on all Circular Lines, it is much easier: For first, very few Instruments, unless at one part of the Line, can express nearer than minutes of a degree.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The whole Radius or Line of Lines is but 90 degrees, or but 45 of the Tangents, or 60 of the Chords or Secants: So that in Instruments of 12 or 18 inches Radius, you may express very well every tenth minute, to 60 on the Line of Sines: and every half degree to 75, and whole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees to 90. And on the Tangents or Chords, every 10th minute quite through: and the Secants as the Sines.</p>
                  <p>So that any degree or minute being na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>First, every 10th degree is noted with a long stroke, and figures set thereunto. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, every whole degree is cut between two, or three Lines, and sometimes with a Point or Mark on the end of the stroke; and every 5th degree cut up higher than the rest, and sometimes with three Points, on the end
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61037:18"/>
of the Line, or some other convenient di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction, for readiness sake: and every 10th, 15th, or 30th minute, is cut only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two Lines and no more; as will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear very plain with a little practice.</p>

                  <p>To find the versed Sine of an Ark or Angle, or the Sine of an Ark or Angle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 90 degrees, or the Chord above 180 degrees, observe these Rules.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:61037:19"/>1. First, a right Sine, is the measure on the Line of Sines, from the center or begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of that Line, to the Point that doth represent the Ark or Angle required.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The right Sine of an Ark or Angle above 90 degrees, is equal, to the right Sine of the Complement thereof to 180 degrees, being readily accounted, thus; Count the excess above 90 backwards, from 90 toward the Center; then the measure or distance from the end of the account to the Center, is the Sine of the Ark above 90 required: <hi>Example.</hi> Let the Sine of 130 be required, first, if you take 130 from 180, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder is 50; then I say that the right Sine of 50, is also right Sine of 130; for if you count backwards from 90, calling 80, 100; and 70, 110; and 60, 120; and 50, 130; the measure from thence to 00, or the Center, is the right Sine of 130 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The versed Sine of an Ark or Angle, is the measure on the Line of Sines from 90 toward the Center, counted backwards, as the small figures for Complements shew, counting 90 for 00, and the Center for 90, (as the Azimuth Line is figured) opening the Line of Sines to a strait Line, and then counting beyond 90 for the versed Sines a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 90, as on the versed Sines is plainly
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:61037:19"/>
seen in the figure of the Rule.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. For Chords of any Ark or Angle, do thus:</p>
                  <p>Halve the Ark or Angle required, and take the right Sine thereof, and that shall be the Chord thereof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Example.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I would have the Chord of 40, the half of 40 is 20; then I say the right Sine of 20 is the Chord of 40, to that Radius that is equal to the right Sine of 30 degrees, at the Radius the Rule stands at.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. To find a Chord to an Ark or Angle above 180 degrees, you must count as you did the right Sines; for note, the Chord of 180 is equal to the right Sine of 90 dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, which is the full Diameter of a Circle: and a longer right Line than the Diameter cannot be taken in a Circle; therefore it must needs follow that Chords of above 180, are shorter than the Diameter which is the biggest Chord; therefore the Chord of 260, is equal to the Chord of 100 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, or right Sine of 50, the Sine of 30 being Radius.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. In using the Artificial Sines and Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents, or Secants; if you are to use a Sine above 90, then count 80 for 100, 70 for 110, 60 for 120, &amp;c. But for Secants,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:61037:20"/>
then count after the manner of versed Sines: Thus the Secant of 60 is as far beyond 90, as it is from 30 to 90; so that when you have occasion to use an Artificial Secant, which is not often, Then set the end of the Rule against a Table, and counting back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards from 90 to the number of the Secant required, turn that distance beyond 90 on the Board or Table, and that shall be your Secant required, as will be afterward hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as they come in use.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II. A brief Description of the Lines of a Circle, and the Explanation of some termes used in the following Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</head>
               <p>FOR the better understanding of the following discourse, it is needful to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand these Elements or Principles, as the Letters are necessary to be known before reading.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A Circle is a figure enclosed in one cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Line, called the Circumference; in the middle whereof is a Point called the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:61037:20"/>
From which Point all right Lines drawn to the Circumference, are equal one to another; as in the Circle ABCD, E is the Center, ABCD the Circumference, the Lines EA, EB, EC, ED are equal.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Any right Line crossing the Circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and passing through the Center of a Circle, is called the Diameter; and it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides the whole Circle into two equal parts, called Semi-circles (or half-Circles.) And the half of that Line is called the Semi-diameter or Radius to that Circle. As the Line AC is the Diameter, and EC the half-Diameter or Radius.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Any other Right-line crossing the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference is called a Chord, or Subtence, as the Line FG, which divides the Circle into two unequal parts: And note, that this Subtence belongs both to the lesser, and also to the greater part of the Circumference; that is to say, the Chord of 90 deg. is also the Chord of 270 deg. so that FG is Chord to the Ark FBG 90 deg. and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to the Ark FDG being 270 deg. much more than half the Circle.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Half the Chord of any Ark, is the right Sine of half that Ark: thus the right Line HG, the half of FG, is the right Sine of the Ark BG the half of FBG.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Sine Complement or Cosine of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61037:21"/>
any Ark is the nearest distance from the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference to the Diameter: Perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler to that Diameter from whence you coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the degrees and minutes of the Ark or Angle. As thus, GI is the Cosine of the Ark BG; and the Right Sine of any Ark is the nearest distance from the Circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Diameter you counted the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees from, as GH is the Right Sine of BG.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The versed Sine of any Ark or Angle, is the Segment of the Diameter between the right Sine of the same Ark and the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference.</p>
               <p>Thus HB is the versed Sine of the Ark BG, and HD the versed Sine of GD. So also is GH the right Sine of the Ark GCD or the Angle GED 45 degrees above 90, <hi>viz.</hi> 135 degrees.</p>
               <p n="7">7. A <hi>Tangent</hi> is a right Line drawn per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendiculer to the Diameter, beginning at one extreme of the given-Ark, and termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated by a right Line drawn from the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the other extreme, of the given-Ark in the Circumference, till it inter-sect the perpendiculer; Thus CK is the Tangent of the Ark CG, or the Angle CEG, 45 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees.</p>
               <p n="8">8. A <hi>Secant</hi> is a right Line drawn from the Center thorow one extreme of the given-Ark,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:61037:21"/>
till it meet with the Tangent rais'd per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicularly from the Diameter, drawn to the other Extreme of the said Ark; Thus the Line EK is the Secant of the Ark CG, or the Angle GEC.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Note, as in a (Natural) Sine, the nearest distance from the Ark to one Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, from whence you counted the degrees o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the Ark or Angle, was the Right Sine; and the nearest distance from the same Point to the other perpendiculer Diameter, is the Cosine of that Ark or Angle.</p>
               <p>So likewise the nearest distance from the Point where the Tangent and Secant meets, to one of the Diameters aforesaid, is the Tangent of the Ark or Angle; so the nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest distance from the meeting Point of the same Secant-line is the other Tangent-line to the other Diameter abovesaid, is the Co-Tangent of the Ark or Angle abovesaid.</p>
               <p>Thus the Right-line KC is the Tangent of 45, and the Right Line KB the Co-Tangent of 45; Also the Line LC is the Tangent of 53, 30; and the Line MB is the co-Tangent thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> the Tangent of 36, 30.</p>
               <p>Also the nearest distance from L to EB, is the Tangent of 36, 30, to the Radius LC.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Every <hi>Circle</hi> is supposed to be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61037:22"/>
into 360 degrees; the Semi-circle into 180, the Quadrant or Quarter into 90.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Every <hi>Degree</hi> is supposed to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into 60 minutes, and every minute into 60 Seconds, and every Second into 60 Thirds, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="12">12. A <hi>Radius,</hi> or <hi>Semidiameter,</hi> is in our Instrumental Practice, supposed to be divided into 10000 parts, and every Chord, Sine, Tangent, or Secant, is to be divided by the Parts of the same Radius, or Radius and Parts more.</p>
               <p n="13">13. An <hi>Angle</hi> is the meeting of two Right Lines, as GE, and EC, meeting at E, do constitute the Angle GEC, called a Right-lined Angle; or when two Circles cross one another, it is called a Spherical Angle, the Anguler Point being noted al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes by the middle Letter of three that shew the Triangle.</p>
               <p n="14">14. A <hi>Plain Triangle</hi> is the meeting of three Right Lines crossing one another; and a <hi>Spherical Triangle</hi> is constituted by the crossing of three Circles, as in the two Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures noted II and III, you may plainly see.</p>
               <p n="15">15. All <hi>Angles,</hi> Plain and Spherical, are either Acute, Right, or Obtuce.</p>
               <p n="16">16. An <hi>Acute Angle</hi> hath a sharp Point containing an Angle less than 90 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,

               <p n="18">18. An <hi>Obtuce Angle</hi> is alwayes more than 90 degrees, as the Angles at D in both Figures shew.</p>
               <p n="19">19. A <hi>Parallel Line,</hi> is any Line drawn by another Line in such a way, that though it were infinitely produced, yet they would never meet or cross one another, as the Lines AB, CD.</p>
               <p n="20">20. A <hi>Perpendiculer Line,</hi> is when one Line so falleth on another Line, that the Angles on each side are equal, as CA falls of the Line BA, Figure VI.</p>
               <p n="21">21. All <hi>Triangles</hi> are either with three equal sides, as Figure IIII, or two equal sides, as Figure V, or all unequal sides, as Figure VI; the first of which is called <hi>Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateral,</hi> the second <hi>Isosceles,</hi> the third <hi>Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="22">22. Again, they may be sometimes na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med from their Angles; thus: <hi>Orthigonium,</hi> with one Right Angle, and two Acute Angles. <hi>Ambligonium,</hi> with one Obtuce Angle, and two Acute Angles. <hi>Oxigoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> with three Acute Angles only.</p>
               <p n="23">
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:61037:24"/>23. The three Angles of every <hi>Plain Triangle,</hi> are equal to two Right Angles.</p>
               <p n="24">24. All <hi>Four-sided Figures</hi> are either Squares, with four sides, and four right Angles all equal; or long Squares (or Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs) with the two opposite sides equal, or the same crushed together, or not Right-Angled, as the <hi>Rombus,</hi> and <hi>Rombords,</hi> or else with four unequal Sides, called <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peziaes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="25">25. Lastly, many sided-Figures, are some Regular, having every side alike, as 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, &amp;c. Or else unlike, as Fields, and Woods, and Meadows, which being infinite, cannot be comprehended un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any Regular Order or Rule.</p>
               <p n="26">26. <hi>Multiplicator,</hi> is a term used in Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication, by which any Number is to be multiplied, as is saying 5 <hi>times</hi> 6, 5 is the Multiplicator of 6.</p>
               <p n="27">27. <hi>Multiplicand,</hi> is the Number to be multiplied, as 6 by 5, as above named.</p>
               <p n="28">28. The <hi>Product,</hi> is the Issue or Result of two Numbers multiplied one by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as 30 is the Product of 6 multiplied by 5; for 6 times 5 is 30.</p>
               <p n="29">29. <hi>Divisor,</hi> is a term used in Division, and is the Number by which another Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is to be divided; as to say, How many times 5 in 30? 5 here is the Divisor.</p>
               <p n="30">
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:61037:24"/>30. <hi>Dividend,</hi> is the Number to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, as 30 abovesaid.</p>
               <p n="31">31. <hi>Quotient,</hi> is the Answer to the How many times (as in the abovesaid) 5 is in 30? 6 times: 6 then is the Quotient.</p>
               <p n="32">32. <hi>Square,</hi> is the Product of two Numbers multiplied together, as the Square of 6 multiplied by 6, is 36.</p>
               <p n="33">33. <hi>Square-root</hi> of any Number, is that number, which being multiplied by it self, shall have a Product or Square equal to the given Number; thus the Square-root of 36 is 6; for 6 multiplied by 6, is 36, equal to the first given Number.</p>
               <p>But if it be a Number that cannot be squared, as 72, the content of half a Foot of Board; whose near Square-root is 8: 4852811 of 10000000, then is the Square-root to be exprest as near as you may (or care for) as here the Square-root of 72, which is called a Surd Number, that will not be squared.</p>
               <p n="34">34. <hi>Cube,</hi> is a second Product, or power of two Numbers increasing or multiplied together, as thus; the Square of 6 is 36, the first power: and the Cube of 6 is 216, that is to say 6 times 36, the second power.</p>
               <p n="35">35. <hi>Cube-root</hi> of any Number, is a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Quotient decreasing between the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber given to be cubed and 1, as thus; the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:61037:25"/>
                  <figure/>
Cube-root of 216, is to be found out by the Line of Numbers, the third part of the distance between 216 and 1, is at 2 repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions found to stay at 6; for if you should have 216 Cubes or Dies, which is a proper Cube, you shall find that 36 laid together one by another, making a Square repeated 6 times, will use or take up 216, the just number, and make one great square Die; and no other Number whatsoever, except 6, will do the like; therefore 6 is the Cube-root of 216.</p>
               <p>In Mr. <hi>Windgate's</hi> Book of <hi>Arithmetick,</hi> is the way of doing it by Numbers or Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, being one of the hardest Lessons in Arithmetick.</p>

Also, when the Sun or Stars come to the South, or North-part of the Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, their Altitudes are then highest, and lowest. And the difference of Meridians is the difference of Longitudes of Places, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Circle ZHNS in the Analem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma; and NZ ♋ S in Horizontal-projection.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Equinoctial</hi> is a great Circle, every where 90 degrees distant from the two Poles of the World, dividing the Sphear into two halfs, called the North and South Hemisphear; and is called also the Aequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, because when the Sun passeth by it twice a year, it makes the day and nights equal in all places; noted by WAEE, and AEEAE in both.</p>

                  <p>Note also, that this looking up toward the Sun, is only then when the Sun is in a cloud, and may be seen in the Abiss, but will not give a clear shadow: Or else you must use a piece of Red, or a Blue, or Green Glass, to darken the luster that it offend not the eyes.</p>
                  <p>But if the Sun be clear and bright, then you need not look up toward it, but hold the <hi>Trianguler Quadrant</hi> so, that the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of the Pin in the Center may fall just on the shadow of the Pin in the Rectifying-point, and both those shadows on your

                  <p>Let 8 be given to be multiplied by 6; If you set one Point of the Compasses in 1, (either at the beginning, or at the middle, or at the end, it matters not which; yet the middle 1 on the Head-leg, is for the most part the most convenient) and open the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to 6, (or 8, it matters not which, for 6 times 8, and 8 times 6, are alike; (but yet you may mind the Precept if you will) the same Extent, laid the same way from 8, shall reach to 48, the Product required;

which, without these Parenthesis, is thus:
<list>
                        <item>The Extent from 1 to 6, shall reach the same way from 8 to 48. Or,</item>

                     <hi>By the Natural-Lines on the Sector-side, or Trianguler Quadrant with a Thred and Compasses, the work is thus;</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. For the most part it is wrought by changing the terms from the Artificial way, as thus;</p>
                  <p>The former way was, as 1 to 6, so is 8 to 48; or as 1 to 8, so is 6 to 48; but by the Sector it is thus: As the Latteral 6 taken from the Center toward the end, is to the Parallel 10 &amp; 10, set over from 10 to 10, at the end counted as 1; so is the Parallel-distance between 8 &amp; 8, on the Line of Lines taken a-cross from one Leg to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to the Latteral-distance from the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to 48, the Product required.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Or shorter thus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As the Latteral 8, to the Parallel 10;</p>
                  <p>So is the Parallel 6, to the Latteral 48.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>See Figure</hi> I.</p>

                     <pb n="80" facs="tcp:61037:50"/>2. Another way may you work without altering the terms from the Artificial way, as thus, by a double Radius; Take the Lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral-Extent from the Center to 1, (or from 10 to 9, if the beginning be defective) make this a Parallel in 6 &amp; 6, then the Latteral-Extent from the Center to 8 of the 10 parts between Figure and Figure, shall reach a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cross from 48 to 48, as before. <hi>See Fig.</hi> II.</p>
                  <p>The same work as was done by the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, is done by the Line of Lines, and Thred on the Quadrant-side, that if your Sector be put together as a Trianguler Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drant, you may work any thing by it, as well as by the Sector, in this manner; (or by the Scale and Compass, as in the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure I.) and first, as above, Sector-wise.</p>
                  <p>Take the Extent from the Center to 6 latte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, between your Compasses; set one Point in 10, and with the other lay the Thred in the nearest distance, turning the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass-Point about, till it will but just touch the Thred, then there keep it; then set one Point of the Compasses in 8, and take the nearest distance to the Thred; this distance laid latterally from the Center, shall reach to 48 the Product.</p>
                  <p>Or as Latteral 6, to Parallel 10; so is the Parallel 8, to the Latteral 48, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct required.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="81" facs="tcp:61037:50"/>Or the last way by a double Radius, or a greater and a smaller Scale, as the Latteral Extent from the Center to 1, is to the Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel 6, laying the Thred to the nearest di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance; so is the latteral Extent from the Center to 8 parts, less than the 1 before ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, carried parallelly along the common-line, till the other Point will but just touch the Thred, it shall on those conditions stay only at 48, the Product required. Observe and note the Figure, by protraction, with Scale and Compass.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But if you have an Index and a Square, as is used in the Demonstrative Work of <hi>Plain Sayling,</hi> as you shall have afterwards, then the representation of this Natural-way will most evidently appear, as thus:</p>
                  <p>Set the edge of the Square to 1; on the Line of Lines, counted from the Center downwards, where the Figure 1 is, then move the Index till the edge cut 8 of the small parts, counted on the Square, from the Line of Lines toward the end of the Square, and then there keep the Index; then remove the Square downward to 6, on the Line of Lines; then there holding it square, you shall see the Index to cut 48 on the Square, counting after the same rate that the 8 parts was accounted. Note the
<figure/>
                     <pb n="82" facs="tcp:61037:51"/>
Figure III. for illustration sake.</p>
                  <p>From hence you may observe, That the first and third Numbers must alwayes be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted alike, and on like Scales; and the second and the fourth in like manner on like Scales and counting; and the Latteral-first Number, must alwayes be less than the Parallel-second, in length or quantity, or you cannot work it; which you must make so, either by changing the terms, or using a less Scale, to begin and end upon.</p>
                  <p>Here you must except a Decimal grada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as thus; sometimes the same place which is called 10 in the first, may be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted 100 in the third, and the contrary; or more or less differing in a Decimal Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
                  <p>But if you would see a Figure of the Sector-way of operation, then it is thus; Let the Line C 6, represent one Leg of the Sector; and the other Line C 6, represent the other Leg of the Sector; then take 1 out of any Scale, as 1 inch, or one tenth part of a foot, or what you please: or the distance from the Center to 1, or 2, on the Line of Lines between your Compasses: put this distance over in 6 &amp; 6, of the Line of Lines. Then is the Sector set to its due <hi>Isosocles</hi> Angle.</p>
                  <p>Then take 8 parts, or rather 8 tenth
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:61037:51"/>
parts of the former 1, from the Scale from whence you took the first Latteral distance, and carry it parallel between the Line of Lines till it stay in like parts, which you shall find to be at 48, the Product requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
                  <p>Or to get the Answer in a Latteral-line, is generally most convenient, by changing the terms; work thus: Take the Latteral-distance from the Center to 8, on the Line of Lines, make it a Parallel in 10 &amp; 10; then the Sector being so set, take the Parallel-distance between 6 &amp; 6, and lay it latteral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the Center, and it shall reach to 48, the Product required. <hi>See Fig.</hi> IIII.</p>
                  <p>Thus you see that the way of the Sector-side, and of the Quadrant-side, is in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner all one; and the laying of the Thred, or Index to the nearest distance, is the same with setting the Legs of the Sector to their Angle; and the taking the nearest distance from any Point or Number to the Thred, is the same with taking parallelly from Point to Point, or from Number to Number: So that having thus fully explained the Lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral and Parallel-Extent, and laying of the Thred, and setting of the Sector, the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Propositions will be more easie, and ready; and to that purpose, these brief Marks for Latteral, Parallel, and Nearest-distance,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:61037:52"/>
will frequently be used; as thus, for Latteral, thus —; for Parallel, thus =; for Nearest-distance, thus |, or ND, thus: for the Sine of 90, or Radius, or Tangent of 45, thus R; &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>In all which wayes you may see, that for the want of several Radiusses, which do properly express the unites, tens, hundreds, and thousands, and ten thousands of Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, there must a due and rational account, or consideration, go along with this Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental manner of work, else you may give an erroneous answer to the question pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded; to prevent which, observe, that in Multiplication there must be for the most part, as many figures in the Product, as is in the Multiplicator and Multiplicand, put together; except when the first figures of the Product, be greater than any of the first figures of the Multiplicator, or the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicand, and then there is one less;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>As for Example.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2 times 2 makes 4, being only one fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, because 4 is greater than 2; but 2 times 5 is 10, being two figures; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in 1, the first figure, is less than 5. Again, in a bigger sum; 52 multiplied by 23, makes 1300, consisting of four figures, as many as
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:61037:52"/>
is in the Multiplier and Multiplicand put together; but if you multiply 42 by 22, it makes but 924, which is but three figures; because the first figure 9 is greater than 2 or 4, as in the former, the first figure 1 was less than 5 or 2: And this Rule is general, as to the number of places, or figures, in any Multiplication whatsoever; but note, that no Instrument extant, and in ordinary use, is capable to express above 5 or 6 places: Yet with this help you may come true to 5 places, with a good Line of Numbers.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>Suppose I was by a Line of Numbers to multiply 168 by 249; the extent from 1 to 168, will reach the same way from 249, to 41832: Now by the Line of Numbers, you can only see but the 418, and estimate at the 3; but the last figure 2, I cannot see by any Line usually put on two foot Rules, therefore the 168, and 249 being before you, say (according to the vulgar Rules of Multiplication) 9 times 8 is 72; therefore 2 must needs be the last figure; and if you can see the former 4, you have the Product infallibly true: if not, multiply a figure more: But by this help you shall be sure
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:61037:53"/>
to come right alwayes to 4 figures, or pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, in any Multiplication whatsoever.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Also, by these operations, you may plainly see, That the Line of Numbers, or <hi>Gunters</hi>-Line, as it is usually called, is the easiest and exactest for Arithmetical opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, being performed with an Extent of the Compasses only, without any opening or shutting of the Rule, or laying a Thred or Index: But in Questions of <hi>Geometry,</hi> where a lively draught or representation is required, as to the reason of the work, there the Natural-Lines are more demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strative.</p>
                  <p>In which Natural Work, Note, That the Parallel-distance must alwayes be the greatest, or you cannot work it, unless you make use of a greater, and a lesser Scale; to which purpose, this Instrument is well furnished, with three or four Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diusses, bigger and less, both of Sines, Tangents, and Secants, and Equal-Parts, as in their due places shall be observed; and taken notice of, in the <hi>Astronomical</hi>-Work.</p>
                  <p>And note also, That if the Line of Lines were repeated to 4 Radiusses, or 400 instead of 10, you might work right-on to 4 figures; but then the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diusses
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:61037:53"/>
must be very small, or the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment very large.</p>
                  <p>Therefore this of 10, being the most usual, I shall make use of, and work every Question the most convenient way; that by a frequent Practice, the young Beginners, for whom only I write, may see the Reason and Nature of the Work, and the sooner understand it.</p>
                  <p>For a Conclusion of this Rule of Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, take three or four Examples more, both by the Line of Numbers, and Equal-Parts also;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. First 15 foot, 8 tenths, multiplied 9 foot and 7 tenths, by the Line of Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; the Extent of the Compasses from 1 to 9 foot, 7 tenths, shall reach the same way from 15—8, to 153, 26.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>By the Line of Lines, or Equal Parts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As the Latteral — 15—8, to the Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel = 10, at the End counted as 1;</p>
                  <p>So is the Parallel = 9—7, to the Lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral — 153—26.</p>
                  <p>Where you may observe, that the first and fourth, are measured on like Scales; and the second and third, also on like Scales.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="88" facs="tcp:61037:54"/>But note; that as you diminished the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count in the third = work, counting 9—7 less than 10 reckoned as 1:</p>
                  <p>So likewise in the — fourth, you count 153—26, which is less in Extent than the 15—8, first taken Latterally; yet is to be read as before, <hi>viz.</hi> 153—26, because 9 times 15, must needs be above 100.</p>

                  <p>The Cubick-root of a Number, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes the first of two mean proportionals between 1, and the Number given; coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the unite with the following cautions: Set the Number down, and put a Point un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the 1st, the 4th, the 7th, and the 10th figure; and look how many Points you have, so many figures shall you have in the Root.</p>
                  <p>Then if the last Point fall on the last Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, then the middle 1 must be the unite, and the Root, the Square, and Cube will fall forwards toward 10.</p>
                  <p>But if the last Point fall on the last but one, then the unite may be placed at ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end, <hi>viz.</hi> at 1 at the beginning, or at 10 at the end; and then the Cube will be one Radius beyond the unite, either for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards or backwards.</p>

                  <p>So that by these Rules, the Cubick-root of 8 is 2; for putti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>So likewise in 1331, there is two Points, therefore two figures in the Root; and the last Point being under the last Figure, the middle 1 is the unite; and the space be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween 1 and 1331, being divided into three equal parts, the first part doth end at 11, the Cubick-root of 1331.</p>
                  <p>Again, for 64 there is one Point, and it falls on the last figure but one; therefore the Root contains but one figure, and 1 at the beginning, or 10 at the end, which you please, may be the unite.</p>
                  <p>But yet with this Caution, That the Cube must be in the next Radius beyond that which belongs to the unite; so that dividing the space between 10 and 64, beyond the

middle 1, towards the beginning, into three equal parts; the first part falls on 4, the Cubick-root required: Or, if you divide the space between 1 and 64, near the 10, into three equal parts, the first part falls on 4 also.</p>
                  <p>Again, for 729, there is but one Point; therefore but one figure: Again, it falls on the last but 2; therefore 10 at the end is the unite; and between 10 and the middle 1 backwards, you shall have both Root, Square, and Cube, for the Number required, which will be at 9; For if you divide the space between 10, and 729, into three equal parts, the first part will stay at 9, the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick-root required.</p>
                  <p>Note, if it be a surd Number that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be cubed exactly; yet the Number of figures to be accounted as Integers is as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and the residue discoverable by the Line, is a Decimal Fraction.</p>

                  <p>Thus you have a very good and ready way for this hard question in Arithmetick<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and will come near enough for most uses.</p>
                  <p>But to perform this by the Natural-lines, at the best it is very troublesome, and cannot come to no such exactness, as by the Line of

                  <p>
                     <hi>Example.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let 4 and 32, be two extream Numbers (or the measure of two extream Lines) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween which I would have, two mean pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portional Numbers (or Lines) required.</p>
                  <p>In dividing the space on the Line of Numbers, between 4 and 32, into three e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual parts, you shall find the Compasses to stay first at 8, secondly at 16; the two mean proportionals, between 8 and 32, the two extream Numbers first given.</p>
                  <p>For the Square or Product of 4 and 32, the two extreams, 128, is equal to the Square

                  <p>As the diameter of the Globe, whose con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent is also given, is to the diameter of the Globe whose content is required; so is the content given, to the content required; by repeating the Extent the same way three times. <hi>Example.</hi> Suppose the capassity or content of a Globe, whose diameter is 10 inches, be 523 inches solid, and 80 parts; what shall the content of that Globe be whose diameter is 20 inches? the Extent from 10 to 20, being turned three times from 523-8, the content of a Globe of 10 inches diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, shall reach to 4190 10/1, the Cubick inches contained in a Globe of 20 inches diameter, being 8 times as much as the former.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>First, by the 4th last past, find the Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude of the side, or Diameter of the Sphear, having equal weight; and note that down, or keep it.</p>
                  <p>Then find out two mean proportions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the weights given; and setting this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, on the Line of Numbers, the right way, either increasing, or diminishing from
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:61037:71"/>
the side given, shall shew the side or dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter required.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Example.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Suppose I have a Bullet of Iron weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 60 pound, and the diameter thereof is 7 inches, 57 parts; I would have a Bullet of Lead like unto it, to weigh one third part more; what must his diameter be?</p>
                  <p>First by finding out of two mean propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionals, between the Points, on the Line of Numbers, for each Metal; and laying it the right way from the side of the body given, it gives the diameter of the other bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of equal weight, with the first given bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; as the Iron Bullet being 7 inches, 57 parts diameter, the Leaden Bullet of the same weight is but 6 inches, and 70 parts.</p>
                  <p>Then find two mean proportionals be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween 60, the weight given; and 80, one third part more: and repeat this the right way (<hi>viz.</hi> increasing) from 6 inches, 70 parts, and it shall shew on the Line of Numbers 7-37, the diameter of a Leaden Bullet, that shall weigh one third part more than an Iron Bullet of 60 pound weight, <hi>viz.</hi> 80 pound.</p>
                  <p>The performance of these Propositions by the Sector, without the help of a Line of Superfecies, and solids, is very troublesome to do: And if you have a right <hi>Gunters</hi> Sector, you may have also his Book of the

Use thereof, but this way by the Numbers is as quick, and more certain, having your proportional Points or Numbers true; but the way by the Pen is best.</p>

                  <p>To part, or divide a Line or Number, by extream and mean proportion, is to part it so, that the greatest part shall bear such proportion to the lesser, as the whole doth to the greatest part; so that the square of the greater part, shall be equal to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the whole, and the lesser part mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied together: Or, if you add the Square of the whole, and the square of the lesser-part together, it is 3 times as much as the square of the greater-part. <hi>See Dig's Theorems.</hi>

                     <hi>To find this by Arithmetick, do thus;</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, square the given Number (that is, multiply it by it self) then multiply the Product by 5, and divide this Product by 4; then find the Square-root of the Quoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and from it take half the given Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, the residue is the greater portion, then the greater part taken from the whole, leaves the lesser-part.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>By the Sector, work thus;</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Open the Sector to a Right Angle, in the Line of Lines (making Latteral 10, a Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel in 8 and 6) or else make the Latteral 90, a Parallel Sine of 45 (or the Latteral Sine of 45, a Parallel Sine of 30) then upon both Legs count the given Number; then take the Parallel Ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ent from the whole Number on one Leg, to the half on the other Leg, and lay this from the Center Latterally; and whatsoever the Point reacheth beyond the whole Number, must be added to the half Number, to make up the greater Number; or taken from the half to make the lesser.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Example.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let the Number given be 12, which may be represented at 6 on the Line of Lines;
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:61037:73"/>
then the Sector standing at Right Angles, take the Parallel-distance from 3, the half of 6 (counted as 12) on one Leg, to 6 on the other Leg, and you shall find it reach to 6-71, which doubled is 13-42; from which if you take 6, the half sum, rest 7-42 for the greater part: and if you take 7-42 from 12, there remains 4-58, the lesser-part.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But by the Line of Numbers work thus: following the Arithmetical way.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Extend the Compasses from 1 to 12, and that extent shall reach from 12 to 144; then next the extent from 1 to 144, shall reach from 5 to 720; then the extent from 4 to 1, shall reach from 720 to 180: then to find the Square-root of 180; the half-distance between 180 and 1, you will find to be at 13-42, as before; which used as abovesaid, gives the extream, and the mean proportional parts of 12 required.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Another Example of <hi>26.</hi>

                  <p>Extend the Compasses from 1 to 26, and repeat the same again forward from 26, shall reach to 676.</p>
                  <p>Again, the Extent from 1 to 676, shall reach from 5 to 3380.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="127" facs="tcp:61037:73"/>Lastly, the Extent from 4 to 1, shall reach from 3380, to 845; and the Square-root of 845, is 29-07: from which Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber or Root, if you take half the given Number, <hi>viz.</hi> 13; then there will remain 16-07, one extream: then 16-07 taken from 26-0, rest 9-93, the other extream required.</p>
                  <p>For the Extent from 26 to 16-07, will reach from 16-07, to 9-93.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Another way by the Line of Sines, Geometrically.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The best and quickest way is by the Line of Sines, thus; Make the given Line a Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel-Sine of 90; then take out the parallel-Sine of 38 degrees, 10 minutes, and that shall be the greater part.</p>
                  <p>Also, take out the Parallel-Sine of 22 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, 27 minutes, and that shall be the lesser extream required: Or, according to Mr. <hi>Gunter,</hi> use 54 for the whole Line, 30 for the greater part, and 18 for the less.</p>
                  <p>Also by consequence, having the mean, or greater part, make it a parallel-Sine of 38 degrees, 10 minutes; then Parallel 90 shall be the whole Line, and Parallel 22 degrees, 27 minutes, shall be the lesser part.</p>
                  <p>And lastly, having the least part, make
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:61037:74"/>
it a Parallel in 22 degrees, 27 minutes; then Parallel 90 deg. 10 min. shall be the whole Line; and Parallel 38-10, the greater part.</p>
                  <p>The Use whereof, you shall have after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in the 11<hi>th Chapter,</hi> about the cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off the <hi>Platonical Bodies.</hi>

                  <p n="3">3. Of the three termes propounded, (in direct proportion) that of Demand is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes the third term, and one of the terms of Supposition, <hi>viz.</hi> that of the same Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, with the term of Demand, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes the first; then the other of Suppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on left, must needs be the second term in the Question.</p>

                  <p n="5">5.

                  </p>
                  <p>If one pound cost two shillings, what shall 30 ounces cost?</p>
                  <p>Here you see that the term of Demand, 30 ounces<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>viz.</hi> the third term, is not direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the same Denomination with one pound, the first term; but is thus to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to ounces: <hi>Saying</hi>;</p>
                  <p>If 16 ounces cost 2 shillings, what shall 30 ounces cost? 3 <hi>s</hi> — 9 <hi>d.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus the first and third terms, are brought to one Denomination: Also you see that the Demand or Question, <hi>viz.</hi> What shall 30 ounces cost? is joyned to the third term; and also that 16 ounces the first term, is of the same Denomination; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the 3 <hi>s.</hi> must needs be the second term, and the Answer to the Question is the fourth.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VII. The use of the Line of Numbers in measuring of any kind of Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial Measure.</head>
               <p>THe Measure that is commonly used in this Work, is a Foot-Rule, divided into 100 parts; or else into 12 inches, and those inches into halves, and quarters, or 8 parts; or inches and 10 parts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but in regard that the Numbers do most fitly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to the 100 parts of a Foot, it will be convenient here to shew how to reduce them, or any other Fraction, from 12 <hi>s.</hi> to 10 <hi>s.</hi> or any other whatsoever, from one Fraction to the other, which by the Line of Numbers is quickly done; as thus, from 12<hi rend="sup">•</hi> to 10<hi rend="sup">•</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reduction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Extend the Compasses from one Denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nator to the other, the same Extent shall reach the same way from one Numerator to the other.</p>
               <pb n="155" facs="tcp:61037:87"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Example.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As 12 to 10, so is 6 half of 12, to 5 half of 10.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Again.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As 120 to 100, so is 30 a 4th of 120, to 25 a 4th of 100.</p>
               <p>Which two Lines of Inches, and Foot-Measure, are usually set together on Rules, for the ready way of Reduction by Occular inspection, only in this manner, <hi>as in the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure</hi>; And the like may be for any thing whatsoever, as Mr. <hi>Edmond Windgate</hi> hath largely shewed in his Arithmetick. Which Line being next to the Line of Numbers on your Rule, will be very plain and ready in the use of the Line of Numbers for feet and inches, or shillings and pence; and the same Rule of Reduction, serves for all manner of Fractions: For as the Denominator of one Fraction is to the Denominator of the other, (which in the Decimal work is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes a unite, with one, two, or more Cyphers) so is the Numerator of one, to the Numerator of the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And Note,</hi> That the operation of Decimal Numbers, and their Fractions, is no other than whole Numbers, except only the cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off so many Figures as there is Fracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

                  <p>But to find the Area say, As the fixed Diameter 10, is to the given Diameter 30; so is the fixed Area for 10, <hi>viz.</hi> 78-54, to 707 — by turning the Compasses two times.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>As 31-42, the fixed Circumference, is to 94-26 the given Circumference; so is 78-54, the fixed Area, answering the fixed Circumference 707, the Area

                  <p>Thus by having five Centers at the five fixed Numbers; or four Centers answering to the four fixed Numbers; for a Circle whose Diameter is 10, having any one of those 5 given, you may find any of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther required.</p>

                  <p>As 272 ¼ (the feet in one Rod) is to 40 foot, the breadth of the House; so is 70 foot, the whole height of every several Story, (reduced) to 10 Rod and 29 parts; which 29 parts you may call a quarter of a Rod, and 10 foot and a half.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The reason whereof is apparent thus:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As 100 is to 272 ¼; so is 29 to near 79; of which 79-68 is a quarter of a Rod, or 25 of 100 is a quarter likewise, which by the Line of Numbers is apparently seen; then every 10th part is 2 foot, and 72 of a hundred, which is near two and three quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; so that here 25 being a quarter of a
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:61037:101"/>
Rod, there is 4 hundred parts more in 29: <hi>Then thus</hi>; the double of 4 is 8, or, twice 4 is 8, and four times three quarters is three foot more; of which you must abate some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what (because 72 ¼ is not 75, which is just three quarters) and all put together, make ten rod, one quarter, ten foot and a half: for if you shall divide the Product of 40, multiplied by 70, which is 2800 by 272 ¼, you shall find the Quotient to be 10 rod, 78 ½, which is, as before, 10 rod, 1 quarter and 10 foot and a half.</p>
                  <p>But note also by the way, That when you come to take out the deductions for the doors and windows, if any happen in a Wall of two Bricks and a half, or in two Bricks; you must add two thirds, or one third more to the length or bredth one way; and then casting them up severally, when they be of several lengths or breadths, you shall do no wrong to the Work-master nor Work-man: For true <hi>Arithmetick</hi> and <hi>Geometry</hi> will lie for no man, or use any kind of partiality.</p>
                  <p>This I conceive is as near a way, as any such business can be performed. But if you will measure every Story severally, taking account of each Story severally in their thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses; then, after it is cast up, the best way, by the Rule, to reduce it, is <hi>thus</hi>;</p>

                  <p>The Extent from 272 ¼, to 100; or 1, shall reach the contrary way from 10 ½, to 29 foot, the feet above ¼ of a Rod.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Observe, That the Tyling, the Roof, the Floors, and Partitions, are measured by the Square; which is 10 foot Square every way, or 100 foot in Area. The Chimneys are usually done by a certain rate for a Chimney; or if to be measured, thus are the height and breadths taken, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>If a Chimney stand singly and alone, not leaning against, or in a Wall, the usual way is to girt it about; and if the Jaumes are but a brick thick, and wrought upright over the Mantle-tree to the Floor; then I say, girt it about for a length, and the height of the Story is the breadth, at a brick thick, because of the gathering together, to make room for the next Hearth above in the next Story.</p>

                     <pb n="187" facs="tcp:61037:103"/>But if the Chimney-back be a Party-Wall, the Wall being first measured, then the brest and the depth of the two Jaumes is one side, and the height of the Story ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side, to be multiplied together, at a brick and a half thick, or a brick thick, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the Jaumes be, and nothing to be abated for the want between the Hearth and the Mantle-tree, because of the Withs and thickning for the next Hearth.</p>

                  <p>In measuring of Ceiling a foot broad, and the length of the Vallies is alwayes to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, more than the whole Roof; Also the length of the Rafter feet, above or beyond the Roof.</p>
                  <p>When Rafters have their usual pitch, which is, when the breadth of the House is 12 foot, the Rafter is 9 foot long, which is 3 quarters of the Floors breadth, be it more or less; then, I say, that the Content of one Floor, and half so much, is the Area of the whole Roof in Squares; to which is to
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:61037:104"/>

                  <p>As 6666, is to the length of the House;</p>
                  <p>So is the breadth to the Content in the Roof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Example.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A House 30 foot long, and 20 foot broad, is 900 foot, or 9 square.</p>
                  <p>For the Extent, from 6666, to 20, shall reach the same way from 30 to 900.</p>
                  <p>Also in measuring of the Roof, as to Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters work, by the Square, there is to be allowance for those Rafters in the Dormers, and Gable-ends, on which no Tiles are laid, as over-work for a particular use and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience, more than need be in a bare Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering, or Roof.</p>
                  <p>Also in measuring of Plasterers work in Partitions and Walls; the Timbers and Quarters, are not to be deducted out of the rendring for Work only, except when the Workman finds the Work and Stuff also, then substract a 6th part for the Quarters in the rendring Work: But in Ceilings, the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:61037:104"/>
Summers which are seen, are alwayes abated<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Doors and Windows also, unless by a due considerate (or an unconsiderate) bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain of running measure.</p>
                  <p>Thus you have a brief account of the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual order, used among Workmen, in taking the Dimentions of a House, <hi>viz.</hi> Brick-work by the Rod; Tileing and Carpenters-work by the Square; Chimneys usually by the Fire; And Plasterers and Painters-work by the Yard; Glasiers, by the Foot.</p>
                  <p>There are many other things to be taken notice of in the Carpenters Bill, as Lintels, Mantle-trees, and Tassels; Luthern Lights, and other Lights, both Architrave and Plain Lights, Sky-lights, or Cubiloes, Modillean Cornish, and guttering Penthouse Cornish, Timber-Front-Story, Cellar-doors, and Door-cases; the Plank and Curb at the Cellar-stairs, Dogleg-stairs, and Open-Newel-stairs, Canted-stairs, counted either by the step or pair; together with the half Spaces on the Corners of the open Newel-stairs, the Rayles and Ballasters, small and great Cornish, Outside-work and Partiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Ceiling Joysts, and the Ashlering, Boarded Partitions, and Chequer-work; back-Doors, and Door-cases; Window-boards, and Wall-timber; Planks in the Foundation, Palcing, Penthouse-floors, and
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:61037:105"/>
Penthouse-roof, furring the Platform, Centerings for the Chimney, Trimmers, Girders-ends, Ends of Brest-summers, and Plate; and more the like, which will come in Accompt to be remembred and set down according as the Building is.</p>
                  <p>Also, with due allowance into the Wall that way the ends of the Joysts are entred or laid in the Wall, <hi>as thus</hi>;</p>
                  <p>If it be Framing Work is only mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured, then 9 Inches ought to be allowed into each Wall, that way the Joysts ends are laid; because every Joyst, if well laid, should have 9 inches, at least, hold on the Wall.</p>
                  <p>But if it be Timber, and Boarding, both to be measured, then 6 inches only is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent allowance; because the Timber is usually vallued at one third part more than the Boarding is.</p>
                  <p>Also, As the Workman doth think on this, the Work-master may not forget to deduct for Stairs, and Chimneys also, where Work and Stuff are both measured; though for Work only it may be very well allowed, unless the better Price make an allowance for it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Note also,</hi> That by the Line of Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, you may readily find the length of the Hips and Rafters, in a Roof of any large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,

                  <p>As 12, the inches in a foot, is to the breadth in inches;</p>

                  <p>As 1 foot to the depth in inches;</p>
                  <p>So is the breadth to 36 inches, which is 3 foot also.</p>
                  <p>But altering the Order in the beginning, alters it in the issue, though the same truth, yet in or under divers denominations; for 48 inches, and 4 foot, are the same; yet sometimes one way is more convenient than another.</p>

                  <p>This is sufficient for the Mensuration of any solid body, in a square, or Cillender-like form, as Timber or Stone usually is, after the true quantity of a foot, or 1728 Cubical inches; but there is a custome used in buying of Oaken-Timber, and Elm-Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, when it is round and unsquared, to take

                  <p>Also in measuring Elm, and Beech, and Ash, whose bark is not peeled off, as Oak usually is; to cast away 1 inch out of the 4th part of the Circumference, which may well be allowed when the Bark is 3 quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of an inch, or more in thickness, and the Tree about 40 inches about, or the 4th part, 10 inches; but if the Bark is thinner, and the Tree less, then 8 inches-square; then an inch is too much to be allowed.</p>
                  <p>Also, if the Tree is greater than a foot-square, and the Bark thick, an inch is too little to be allowed, as by this Rule you may plainly see, by the 7<hi>th Problem</hi> of Superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial-measure in the 7<hi>th Chapter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Suppose a Tree be 48 inches about, the Diameter will be 15 ¼, the 4th of 48, for the square is 12.</p>
                  <p>Now if I take away 1 inch ½ from the Diameter, then the Tree will be but 43 inches and 1/<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> about, whose 4th part is under 11; so that here I may very well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate 1 inch from the 4th part of the Line;
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:61037:132"/>
So consequently, if the Rind be thinner, and the Tree less, a less allowance will serve; and if the Rind be thicker, and the Tree large, there ought to be more, as by cutting the Rind away, and then taking the true diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, you may plainly see.</p>
                  <p>This measuring by the 4th part of the Circumference, for the side of the Square, and allowance for the Bark being allowed for, as before, I say will prove to be just one 5th part over-measure.</p>
                  <p>Especially considering this, That when it is hewed, and large wanes left, then the Tree is marked for more measure, sometimes by 10 foot in 60, than there was before it was hewed; the reason is, because when the Tree is round and unhewn, the girting it, and counting the 4th part for the side of the Square, is but very little more than the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed Square; and then being hewen, and that scarce to an eight Square, and measur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a pair of Callipers, to the extremity of that, doth not then allow the Square e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to the Circle for the side of the Square, as by the working by those several Squares, will very plainly appear, which being fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told and warned of, let those whom it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns look to it.</p>
                  <p>But this being premised, and the Parties agreeing, the difference being as 4 to 5, the
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:61037:133"/>
best way to measure round Timber, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, is by the Diameter taken with a pair of Callipers, and the length; which for the just and true measure is largely handled al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But if this allowance be agreed on, then the Proportion for it is thus;</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As 1-526, to the Diameter;</p>
                  <p>So is the length to a 4th, and so is that 4th to the Content in feet.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Example.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Extent from 1-526 to 15-26, shall reach, being twice repeated from 10 foot, the length, to 10 foot the Content required, being all at one Point.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Or, another Example.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Extent from 1-526, to 20 inches the Diameter, being twice repeated the same way from 10 foot, the length, shall reach to 17 foot ¼ the Content.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Or, if you have the Circumference and length.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then the Extent from 48, to the inches about, being turned twice the same way from the length in feet, shall reach to the Content required.</p>
                  <p>The Extent from 48, to 62, the inches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, being turned twice from 10, the same

way, shall reach to 17 foot ¼, the Content in that measure.</p>
                  <p>Thus you have full and compleat Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections for the measuring of any round Timber by the Line of Numbers, by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Diameter and length given, after any usual manner, there remains only one general and natural way, by find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the base of the middle, or one end, by the 7<hi>th Problem</hi> of Superficial measure; and then to multiply that base by the length, will give the true Content in feet or inches.</p>

               <p>GAging of Vessels, is no other than the Measuring of Solid Bodies; and the former directions for solid Measure, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently and aptly applied, is fully suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient; only observing this difference, That the result or issue of the Question is to be rendred in proper terms, according to the
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:61037:160"/>
demand of the Question, as thus; in mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring of Timber or Stone, the Question is, <hi>How many Feet, or Inches, is there in the Solid Body?</hi> But in Gaging, the Question is, <hi>How many Gallons, Kilderkins, or Barrels is there in the Vessel to be measured?</hi> For which purpose there are fit Numbers, or Gage-Points, requisite to be known, for the more speedy attaining the Answer to the Question, of which in their order, as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth;</p>
               <p>First, You are to remember, That the solid capacity of a Wine-Gallon, is 231 Cube Inches; a Corn-Gallon 272 ¼ Cube inches; an Ale or Beer-Gallon, is 282 ¼ Cube inches; or as some say, 288 Cube in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; So that when you have found the Content of any Vessel in Cube inches, if you divide that sum in inches, by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective Number for the Gallons you would have, the Quotient shall be the Content in Gallons required.</p>
               <div n="1" type="problem">
                  <head>Problem I. To measure a Square Vessel.</head>
                  <p>From hence it follows, That to measure any Square or Oblong Vessel, you must multiply the length and breadth taken in inches, and tenth parts, together; that is to
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:61037:160"/>
say, The one by the other; and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct shall be the Content of the Base in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, superficially: Then multiply this Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial Content of the Base, by the inches, and tenth parts deep, and the Product shall be the solid Content in Cube inches; then divide this Product by 282, gives the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in Ale-Gallons in the Quotient, and the remainder, if any be, are Cube inches.</p>
                  <p>But if you divide by 10161, the Cube inches in a Beer Barrel; or, by 9032 the Cube inches in an Ale Barrel; the Quotient sheweth the Number of Beer or Ale Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, (and the remainder Cube inches.)</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Example of a Brewers Cooler.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The length let be 78 inches and 1 tenth, the breadth let be 320 inches and 5 tenths, and the depth 9 inches and 5 tenths, or half an inch; by multiplying and dividing, as above, you will find 843 Gallons, and 68 Cube inches, to be the solid Content of that Cooler; which work is very readily done by the Line of Numbers, in this manner;</p>
                  <p>Extend the Compasses from 1, to the breadth or length; and the same Extent shall reach from the length or breadth to a 4th, which is the Superficial Content of the Base, or bottom, in Superficial inches.</p>
                  <pb n="298" facs="tcp:61037:161"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Then,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Extent from 282 ¼, to the last Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber found, shall reach the same way from the inches, and tenths deep, to the Content in Gallons.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Example.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Extent from 1, to 78-1, shall reach the same way from 320-5, to 25031; then the Extent from 282 ¼, to 25031, shall reach the same way from 9-5, to 842-68, the Solid Content in Gallons required.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, you must <hi>Note,</hi> You cannot see so many Figures on the Line, as the Product of 4 figures multiplied by 3; yet by the Rules (in <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. <hi>Sect.</hi> 3.) you have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections as to the number of Figures, which here is 7; the two last (next the right hand) being Fractions, or parts of an Inch, and is therefore neglected.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Again,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In dividing the Product of 25031, and 9-5, multiplied together, which makes 6 Figures beside the Fraction by 282, there must needs be three Figures in the Quotient, which are the Gallons: This artificial help you have, beside the present view of the Vessel, which will direct you not to call 842 Gallons, only 84 ½, nor 8420, as you must needs do, if you mistake as to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination.</p>

                     <hi>Again,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You need not to trouble your self, to know what the 4th Number is; but having found the Point representing it, keep the Compass-point fixed there, and open the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to 282 ¼, where you may have a Brass Center-pin for more readiness; but let your account go as 282 ¼ to the 4th, for methods sake, and not as the 4th to 282 ¼; for then you must say, so is the depth the contrary way to the Content in Gallons. All this is hinted for plainness and caution sake, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit to young Learners.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Also Note,</hi> That if you would have had the Answer in Ale or Beer Barrels; then in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stead of 282 ¼, you must use the Point at 9032, for Ale Barrels; or the Point at 10161 for Beer Barrels, being the number of Cube inches in those Barrels, as 282 ¼ is the number of inches, in a Gallon of Ale or Beer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Example for the same Cooler.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Extent from 1 to 78-1, shall reach from 320-5, the same way to 25031; <hi>then,</hi> the Extent from 10161 to 25031, shall reach the same way from 9-5 to 23 ⅓, the true number of Beer Barrels required. <hi>Or,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Extent from 9032, to 25031, shall reach to 26 Barrels, and near 1 third: which

is as quick and ready a way as can be for Square Vessels.</p>

               <div n="2" type="problem">
                  <head>Problem II. To Gage or Measure any round Tunn or Vessel.</head>
                  <p>The plain and natural way for measuring of a round Tun, is this; Measure the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter in inches and tenths, and set down half thereof; Measure also, the Compass round about the inside, and set down the half of that also, in inches and tenth parts; and multiply those two Numbers together, the Product shall be the Content of the Base, or bottom, in Superficial inches; then this Product multiplied by the depth in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, gives the solid Content in inches; then lastly, this Product divided by 282, or by 10161, or by 9032, gives the solid Content in Gallons, or Beer, or Ale Barrels, as before.</p>
                  <p>For, half the Diameter, and half the Circumference, doth reduce the round Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel to an Oblong Vessel, equal to that round Vessel.</p>
                  <p>Which Vessel, when it is brought to a Square, by taking of half the Diameter, and half the Circumference; then the Rule
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:61037:162"/>
last mentioned, for Square Vessels, performs the work exactly, to Gallons, or Barrels, as you please.</p>
                  <p>But when the Vessel is Taper, that is to say, the bottom and top of different Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as generally they all are; then the chief care is to come by the true Diameters, which is best done by a sliding Rule applied to the inside, whose regular equal computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is thus to be ordered;</p>
                  <p>When the Vessel is taper, and the Sides go streight, like the Segment of a Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>; then you may add the Diameters at top and bottom together, and count the half sum for the mean Diameter of that taper Vessel, and multiply half the Diameter, and half his proportional Circumference, as before; and multiply and divide, to get the solid Content in Gallons, or Barrels.</p>
                  <p>But when the Staves are bending, as most of your close Cask are, then the readiest way to come to a mean Diameter, is thus;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Say,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As 10 to 7, or as 10 to 6 &amp; 3/10, 4/10, 5/10, 6/10, 7/10, 8/10, 9/10; according as you shall find most true for several Cask:</p>
                  <p>So is the difference of Diameters to a 4th Number, which is to be added to the least of the Diameters, to make up a mean Diameter.</p>
                  <pb n="302" facs="tcp:61037:163"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>As for Example.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the Sides be round or arching, and the less Diameter be 30 inches, and the greater 40 inches; then, As 10 to 7; So is 10, the difference to 7 inches; which makes (being added to 30, the least Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter) 37, for a mean Diameter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But Note,</hi> It is hinted by Mr. <hi>Dary,</hi> That Vessels, usually, are between a Sphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roid and a Parabolick Spindle; then, if as 10 to 7, be too much to add to the least Diameter; <hi>You may say,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As 10, to 6 ½; <hi>Or,</hi> As 10, to 6 6/10, 7/10, 8/10, 9/10;</p>
                  <p>So is the difference of Diameters to a 4th Number, which you must add to the least Diameter, to make a mean Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter.</p>
                  <p>Having thus gained a mean Diameter, you may work as before; or rather thus more readily and easily, by the Line of Numbers, <hi>thus</hi>;</p>
                  <p>As the Gage-point is to the mean Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter;</p>
                  <p>So is the Length to a 4th, and that 4th to the Content required.</p>

                  <p>The Gage-point of any Solid Measure, is only the Diameter of a Circle, whose Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial Content is equal to the Solid Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the same Measure.</p>

                  <p>The Solid Content of a Wine Gallon is 231 Cube inches: Now if you have a Circle that contains 231 Superficial inches, the Diameter thereof will be found to be 17 inches, and 15 of a hundred; as by the 7th <hi>Problem</hi> of the 7th <hi>Chapter,</hi> is well seen.</p>

                  <p>As 231 (for Wine, or 282 ¼ for Ale-Gallons), is to the sum of the two 4ths added together;</p>
                  <p>So is the length to the Content in Wine-Gallons.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Example, at <hi>18</hi> inches at head, and <hi>32</hi> at bung, that old Example.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Square of 32, is 1024;</p>
                  <p>The Square of 18, is 324:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Then,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Extent of the Compasses from 1, to 0-5236, shall reach from 1024, the Square of 32, to 536-4, two thirds of the bung-Circle.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Again,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Extent from 1, to 0-2618, shall reach from 324, the Square of 18, the Diameter at head, to 84-9, the sum of 536-4, and 84-9, is 621-3.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Then lastly,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Extent from 231, the 621-3, shall
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:61037:165"/>
reach from 40 the length, to 107-58, or 107 Gallons and a half, and better, the Content in Wine-gallons, as briefly as can be done this way.</p>
                  <p>But if you take the Diameters at head and bung, with a Line called <hi>Oughtred's</hi> Gage-line; and set the measure found at the bung by that Line, down twice; and the measure found at the head, found by the same Line, once, and bring them into one sum; then multiply that sum by the length of the Vessel in inches, and 10 parts, and then the Product shall be the Content in Wine-gallons required.</p>
                  <p>As if I should measure a Cask of 18, and 32, as before: right against 18 inches on <hi>Oughtreds</hi>-Line, you find 0-367; and right against 32, you shall find 1-161; this last set down twice, and 0-367 once; added, makes 2-689; and then this sum multiplied by 40, makes 107-56, being very near to the former operation, but dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering about 2 Gallons, from the way set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by the mean Diameter and Gage-point, by reason of the extream swelling of the Cask; But if this way should prove the truest in the Book of <hi>the Carpenters Rule,</hi> you have a <hi>Table</hi> to rectifie this difference, which you will very seldom have occasion to use.</p>

                     <hi>Note also,</hi> That this Line, called <hi>Ough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred</hi>'s Gage-Line, is very excellently impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to find the Content of Great Vessels, either in the whole, or inch by inch; which you will find at large in the Book before mentioned.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>This Problem I shall resolve <hi>two wayes,</hi> either of which is experimented to come
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:61037:167"/>
near the truth, and will very well serve, till a better comes to light.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>One,</hi> by a Line of Segments, joyned to the Line of Numbers, as before in the measuring the Fragments of a Globe; But,</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Other,</hi> is by a way found out by Mr. <hi>Bennit,</hi> a Cooper, that hath long exercised the way of Gaging, which is by comparing a Cask known, and its quantity of empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, to a Cask unknown, and its inches of emptiness, as followeth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First, by the Line of Numbers, and Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Line of Segments, to find the quantity of Gallons that any Vessel wants of being full, at any number of Inches, from the inside of the bung-hole, to the superficies of the Liquor, which is usually called Inches dry.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Extend the Compasses, on the Line of Numbers, from the inches and tenths diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at the bung, to 100 on the Line of Seg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the same extent applied the same way from the inches and parts dry, shall reach to a 4th Number, on the Line of Artificial Segments; which 4th Number you must keep. (Or, if you will, you may use the inches wet, laying the same extent from the inches wet, and that also will on the Seg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:61037:167"/>
give a 4th Number, which you must likewise keep.)</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Then secondly,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As the Extent from 1, to the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the Vessel in Wine or Ale-gallons; So is the 4th Number kept to the Gallons of emptiness, or fullness, that it wants of being full, or the quantity of Gallons in the Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Example, of a Canary-Pipe, whose Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter at bung, is <hi>28</hi> inches and <hi>7,</hi> and full Content is Gallons <hi>116 ½,</hi> at <hi>12</hi> inches dry, or <hi>16</hi> inches, and <hi>7</hi> tenths wet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Extent of the Compasses from 28-7, to 100, (at the end of the Line of Seg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) shall reach the same way from 12, the inches dry, to 39 ½ on the Line of Seg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for a 4th; or from 16-7 wet, to 60 2/10 on the Segments, for his 4th also, which two 4ths keep.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Then secondly,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Extent from 1, to 116 ½, the whole Content in Gallons, shall rea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h from 39, the dry 4th, on the Line of Numbers, to 46 3/10, for the gallons dry or wanting: or the same extent shall reach the same way, on the Line of Numbers, from 60 2/10, the 4th Number for wet, to 70 gallons, and 2 tenths
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:61037:168"/>
in the Vessel, at 16 inches and 7 tenths wet; which two Numbers put together, makes up 116 gallons and a half, the full Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</p>
                  <p>The like manner of working serves for any Cask whatsoever, and the nearer the Vessel wants of being half empty, the more near to the truth will your work be, and the most errour in very round and swelling Cask, when the emptiness is not above one or two inches; but in Vessels near to Cil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenders, it will give the Answer very true, and as readily as any way whatsoever.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Observe also,</hi> That if you use the Seg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in taking the wants, you must abate of the gallons found, till you come to the 2 thirds of the half diameter; that is to say, the Rule sayes, there is more wanting than indeed there is; and that somewhat con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable about the first 6 inches in a vessel of 30 inches diameter: So that I find a <hi>Table</hi> made as a mean between the Superficial and solid Segments, would do the work the truest and best of any other; Or else, use the mean diameter and mean parts of empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; found thus.</p>
                  <p>Take the equaded diameter, from the diameter at the bung; and note the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence: then half this difference taken from the inches and parts empty gives the mean
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:61037:168"/>
emptiness; then use the mean diameter, and mean emptiness, instead of the other, and the work is more exact.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The other way of Mr. <hi>Bennits</hi> inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is thus;</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, you are to fill an ordinary Cask, of a competent magnitude, as 60 or 100 gallons, of a mean form, between a Spheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ord (or roundish form) and a Cillenderi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal form; or else fill two Casks of each form, and learn the true Content, and Diameter of that mean Vessel, or rather of both those Vessels; and the Vessel being full, draw off with a true gallon-measure, and on the drawing off every gallon, take the exact quantity of inches and 10th parts, that the drawing off of every gallon makes in the emptiness or driness of that mean Vessel, or rather both those Vessels, at least until you have drawn off the half quantity of the Vessel, which number of gallons drawn off, and the inches and tenth parts of emptiness, or fulness, or driness or wetness, you must draw into a <hi>Table,</hi> or insert them on a Rule, making the inches as equal parts, and the gallons, and his proportional part of a gallon, the unequal parts; then with the Line of Numbers, and this mean <hi>Table,</hi> or rather two <hi>Tables</hi> or <hi>Scales,</hi> which you may
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:61037:169"/>
put on a Rule, as Mr. <hi>Bennit</hi> hath done, you may find out the wants of any Cask what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever; either Spherioid, or Cillender-like, as followeth.</p>
                  <p>This measured Cask on the Scale, or Table, for methods sake, and avoiding tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tologie, I shall call the first Cask, and the Vessel or Cask, whose wants you would know, I shall call the second Cask; then the proportion is thus.</p>
                  <p>As the Diameter at the bung of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Cask, is to the bung diameter of the first Cask (which is always fixed);</p>
                  <p>So is the inches dry of the second Cask to a 4th (on the Line of Numbers) which 4th Number sought on the inches of your Table, or Scale, on the opposite-part of your Scale or Table, gives a 5th Number, which you must keep.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Then,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As the whole Content of the first Cask, is to the whole Content of the second Cask;</p>
                  <p>So is the first Number kept, to the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Gallons the Vessel wants of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing full, at so many inches dry.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Example.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is such a Scale made on purpose for Victuallers use, to measure what they want of a Barrel of Ale, being put into a Beer-barrel,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:61037:169"/>
which Scale I shall here use, to try this former <hi>Example</hi> by.</p>
                  <p>Suppose, as before, a Canary Pipe want 12 inches of being full, and the Content 116 ½ gallons, and 28 inches and 7 tenths diameter at bung; The Extent on the Line of Numbers from 28-7, to 22-5, shall reach from 12, to 9-4; then just against 9 inches and 4 tenths, on that Barrel Scale, I find 14 gallons of Beer, which is 17 gallons and a half of Wine, being the 5th Number to be kept.</p>
                  <p>Then the Extent from 44, the Content of a Barrel in Wine-gallons, to 116 ½, the Content of a Canary-Pipe in the same gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons, shall reach the same way from 17 ½ the Number kept, to 46, and near a half, the gallons wanting at 12 inches dry, in the Canary Pipe, and 46 gallons, and 3 quarts, is the Number Mr. <hi>Bennit</hi> finds in a Canary-Pipe, by measuring at 12 inches dry.</p>
                  <p>Thus you have an account of the two easie Mechanick wayes, to discover the wants of Cask, very applicable, and ready, and experimented to be <hi>Propè verum.</hi>

                     <hi>Note,</hi> That in doing this, you ought to be very precise, in taking the first Extent from 100, to 106; but to cure the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty thereof, you have this very good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy: If you have a Diagonal Scale, equal

                  <p>First, to find the Principal for 10 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> at the rate of 8 <hi>l. per cent. Say,</hi> If 8 <hi>l.</hi> have 100 for his Principal, what shall 10 <hi>l.</hi> have? The Answer will be 125; for the Extent from 8 to 100, shall reach from 10, the same way, to 125; then by the 2d Problem of this Chapter, 125 <hi>l.</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born for four years, will come to 170 <hi>l.</hi> which is 170 <hi>l.</hi> 0 <hi>s.</hi> 0 <hi>d.</hi> from which sum, if you substract 125 <hi>l.</hi> there remains 45 <hi>l.</hi> the Arrears for 10 <hi>l. per annum</hi> forborn four years, at the rate of 8 <hi>per cent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if you would have the profit of these Arrearages, supposing 2 <hi>l.</hi>—10 <hi>s.</hi> the 4th part of 10 <hi>l. per annum</hi> to be paid quarterly, and to count Use upon Use at the rate above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said,

                     <hi>Also,</hi> you must have the measure from the place where you stood observing, to the Point exactly right under the object, whose height you would have in Feet, Yards, Perch, or what you please, to Integers, and Fractions in Decimals, if it may be.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Also Note,</hi> That in all Right-Angle-Triangles, one Acute Angle is alwayes the complement of the other; so that observing or finding one by Observation, by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence you have the other, by taking that from 90.</p>
                  <p>These things being premised, the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion followes, by the Artificial Numbers, Sines and Tangents, and also by the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Note also by the way,</hi> That in regard the complement of the Angle observed is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently used, if you count the degrees the contrary way, that is to say from the Head, you shall have the complement required; as hath been oftentimes hinted before.</p>

                  <p>Also, the measure from C to A, is found to be 218 foot.</p>
                  <p>

                  </p>
                  <p>As the sine of 48-15, the Angle at B, being the complement of the Angle at C, is to 218 on the Line of Numbers;</p>
                  <p>So is the sine of the Angle at C, 41-45, to 195 the Altitude of AB the height required, found on the Line of Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</p>
                  <p>To which you must add the height of your eye from the ground, in the time of Observation; or on rising grounds from a mark on the Building, or any other object that is level with your eye in time of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation.
