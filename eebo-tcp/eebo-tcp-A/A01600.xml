            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Hence it hath bene euer a laudable custome of liuing Christians to report and make knowne to the world, the noble actes of Gods Saints departed cut

of this vale of miseryes. But is this the onely good, that ariseth of such endeavours? No, for the historyes of the Liues of Saints doe confirme our fayth, stirre vs vp to imitate them, and haue sundry other most profitable effects. And although these motiues may suffice to perswade any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian to penne, and publish the famous actes of holy Martyrs: yet not onely these, but others also mooue me to vndertake this labour, touching the life and death of <hi>Edmund Geninges</hi> Priest, who amongst many others, in defence of Christs Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Apostolique Church, not many yeares since hath in this our Iland most gloriously shed his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent bloud, and lost his temporall life, to gayne eternall.</p>
            <p>Of which motiues, one is my owne exact knowledg of many particulers,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Motiues that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor to wryte this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</hi>
               </note> concerning this Blessed man, wherof others, better able to performe this matter then my selfe, perhaps are ignorant: which parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culers being memorable, would peraduenture therby be buryed in perpetual obliuion, if I should not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer them thus in writing to posterity. Another motiue is, my particuler loue, and deserued affection to the party of whom I am to treat. The third is, the perswasion and intreaty of some speciall friends,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:3207:5"/>
whose requests in such a matter I cannot well ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neglect or withstand. Finally some secret mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues haue often assaulted my mind, and inuited me to this enterprize, which in mature consideration seeme to me to haue proceeded from God himselfe, who would not haue the memory of his Saints so long obscured &amp; forgotten.</p>
            <p>These reasons as they vrged me forward, so o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers also contrariwise hitherto kept me backe,<note place="margin">

               </note> &amp; disswaded me from such proceedinges. First a feare or suspition of being accounted ouer partiall, by reason I haue bene so much linked vnto him in friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippe and fauour, for which cause my Relation perhaps vnto some, might seeme in part faygned through affection, and consequently of doubtful truth. Secondly my owne insufficiency and want of experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in penning such a worthy discourse as this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serueth. These two conceits haue hitherto kept me backe from publishing of this intention. But now the former motiues are demeed by me more forcible, and weygh downe these opposit obiections, especially seing that both these letts &amp; obstacles in the sight of an indifferent Reader, may after a sort be eyther much weakened, or altogeather remooued. The one by a protestation of truth and sincerity. The other

by another meane of like quality.</p>

These thinges (I say) I knowe. VVhat then will it profit me to seeke to honour a Martyr, by faygning and forging a lye? Doth the glory of Gods Saints need any such foule and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honest helpes? No surely. But I will say, as holy Iob sayd:<note place="margin">

            <p>Therfore to cleare my selfe from this suspition, I protest, that I will make mention of no one thing, which I haue not eyther knowne to be true my selfe, or heard from his mouth whose life and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome I write, or haue not receyued as true, by relation from very honest, vertuous, and sufficient persons, whose tender and Catholike consciences (as may iustly be thought) could not beare the burthen
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:3207:6"/>
of vttering such vntruthes.</p>
            <p>Now touching mine owne insufficiency, I hope that the best minded Readers, whom principally I desire to profit and pleasure, will not so much exact, or expect at my handes (discoursing of such a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) Eloquence and Rhetoricall figures, as truth and the playne deliuery of thinges, tending to Gods glory, and theyr owne edification.

I had thought to haue declared at large the birth, and education of this our thrice happy Martyr, leauing the world to iudge of his miraculous alteration; but for diuers respects, perswasion forceth me to silence at this time. And behold <hi>in limine,</hi> at the very first, I will not say a miracle, yet at least a wonder; for scarce had Nature cleansed his sylly corps from such vncleanes as it brought <hi>Ã  maternis visceribus,</hi> from his mothers bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ells, but presently within an houre or two appeared a signe of the magnanimity and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:3207:8"/>
great courage which he was afterward to set forth to the view of the whole world. And this it was.</p>
            <p>The Midwyfe and other women hauing accomplyshed euery thing belonging to theyr office in the birth of the infant; the Nurse sate her downe by the fire, to giue the child his first food; and directing her dugge into his mouth, he presently bitt the same. At which vnexpected payne, the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple woman sent forth loud scrikes and cryes, which she no sooner had done, but the child bitt her agayne. Which vnwonted acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent so bereft the Nurse of all patience, that she was ready to haue done the child some mischiefe had not the women then accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying his mother ranne to succour him;<note place="margin">He was borne with a tooth in his head.</note> who inquiring the cause, they perceaued the lambe to haue played the lyon, and sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching his mouth they found him to haue a very faire white tooth in the forepart ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Which strange spectacle worthily put them all into admiration: and after a day or two, when his weake mother had some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what recouered strength, they related vnto
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:3207:9"/>
her the whole matter which had happened, who what with griefe and wonder was so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed, as being not able to conteyne her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe within the limits of temperate mother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, she brake forth into deepe passions.</p>
            <p>At which time it chanced that a venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble old man, a Doctour of Diuinity lodged in her house, a Catholike (as I my selfe haue heard her say) who hearing and seeing what had happened, and grieuing for her im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience came in to visit her, or rather to comfort and content her. The Doctour was no sooner entred the chamber, but she be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to relate the whole discourse,<note place="margin">A pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall speach foreshe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing his end.</note> as if he had knowne nothing therof. Which done, the graue Doctour began to vse many spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall and comfortable wordes, and in the end vttered (if I may so terme it) these pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall speaches. Be of good cheere (sayd he) your Sonne is, and shall be very well: and concerning his tooth, assure your selfe it doth foretell, that he shall trauayle further, then the Queene hath any land, &amp; at the length retourne agayne to the vnspeakeable ioy and comfort of all that loue him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:3207:9"/>These wordes of the Doctour were often rehearsed in the hearing of many, long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his going ouer the seas, by his mother: the effect of which saying I leaue to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different Reader to consider, whether it be not altogeather accomplished, and whether his glorious Martyrdome, and great courage in the same, foreshewed by his tooth, was not a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>fort to all that loued him or fauoured the Catholike cause. But let vs returne to our Infant, who vntill he was two yeares old had the same tooth in his head, but then he lost it, and it vanished away without payne, trouble, or any aduertisement.</p>
            <p>With no lesse admiration may I report vnto you his admirable ripenes and grauity euen in his infancy,<note place="margin">His grauity in his child<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>hood.</note> who was neuer deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with childish playes, or any thing that might seeme toyish: no, he would neuer be inticed to play at any time with like aged children, but loued greatly to behold the heauens, and therfore he vsually went forth in the euening to delight himselfe with the sight of the skies bedecked with starres. And on a tyme in these his tender yeares going
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:3207:10"/>
forth at night according to his custome, this stra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ge spectacle appeared to him in the ayre. He saw, as it were, armed men with weapons kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and murthering others that were disar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and altogeather destitute of like furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and great store of bloud running eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where about them.</p>
            <p>This strange sight put the child into a great feare,<note place="margin">A vision fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telling our Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>untryes persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> which caused him to runne in hastily to tell his mother, being then a Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, what he had seene, and she presently went forth with three or foure of her neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, who that night had supped with her, and they were all eye-witnesses of the same spectacle. Thus much I my selfe haue heard them report, who also affirmed, that my self was then present, but being very yong, I cannot remember it. This happened in the beginning of our chiefest persecution, not long before the glorious death of B. Father <hi>Campian,</hi> and the rest, about the yeare 1581.</p>

            <p>Now I cannot heere but much admire the prouidence of Almighty God, who by his secret and vnexpected meanes bringeth euer that to passe which he hath preordayned. This youth during all this time, was no member of the Catholike Church, but frequented the Protestants Conuenticles, with the rest of his friendes. How then was he drawne to the true fayth and religion? Oh God, that ordereth all thinges sweetly, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed this accordingly: for it happened that a Gentleman comming to the place where he was taught, and lodging at his Scoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maisters fathers house,<note place="margin">How he became <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
                  </gap> to Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Gen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tlemen</note> who kept an Inne in the same Citty, and by chance, or as God would haue it, meeting the Schoolmayster there at supper, after other ordinary communication, inquired of him, whether it were not possible to get in that Citty a handsome youth to ride with him as his page, whom (quoth he)
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:3207:12"/>
I will mantaine like a gentleman, if he haue learning, nourture, and behauiour beseeming such a person. To which the Schoolmaister made answere: Such a youth there is heere, <hi>Qui virtutem in vultu gerit,</hi> who carryeth ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in his very countenance: but (sayth he) he is the child of a widdow, who I much feare will not easily be perswaded to depart from him.</p>
            <p>Whereupon the Gentleman much desiring to haue a sight of the youth, obtayned that he should be sent for to his lodging, at whose comming he found the Scoolemaisters wordes most true,<note place="margin">His lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of his Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ends.</note> and therfore would not cease his suite vntill he had obtayned his mothers consent, which by long intreaty and large promisses, and an assured speedy retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne (the Iunekeeper and Schoolmaister being his suretyes) at length he enioyed. And so this our yong man being aged about 16. ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ares, vpon a sodayne willingly left both mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, friends, and Country, and with all alacrity put himselfe into the gouerment of a maister, that was vnto him a meere stranger. But heere I must aduertise my
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:3207:12"/>
Courteous Reader, that this good Gentleman was a Catholike, and very much persecuted for his religion in his temporall fortunes,<note place="margin">M Rich. Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood.</note> and therfore made seldome any long aboad in one place, for the better preseruation of his liuing. The same man afterwards went beyond the seas, and was made Priest, so that the man became fellow and brother to his mayster, as shall be related hereafter.</p>
            <p>This Gentleman at the first had a watchfull eye ouer his new seruant in all his actions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he knew all his friendes to be earnest Protestants, but in short time he found him so trusty, so secret,<note place="margin">Hi fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity to his mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</note> and so diligent in all his busines and affayres, that he began to deale with him touching religion for the saluation of his soule: and perceyuing him both tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctable, capable, and willing to heare, he so far instructed him, that at length the youth blushing at his owne ignorance, earnestly desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be reconciled, and made a member of the Catholike Church, from which he promised he would neuer swarue, <hi>Deo adiuuan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te,</hi> with Gods assistance. Which pious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest was not long denied him to his excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

comfort and consolation.</p>
            <p>Behold heere his first entrance into the way towards heauen, his first stepp to his glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous martyrdome,<note place="margin">His first step to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards heauen.</note> whose deuout beginning made him gratious both to God and man. For as before he was diligent in all his mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters affayres; so now he was most fortunate in what he tooke in hand, which caused him to be loued of euery one, with whom he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersed. I cannot heere let passe one thing amongst many which this our pious yong Man did in the seruice of his foresayd Mayster, which I relate the rather, because the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man himselfe, being a Priest in <hi>Bruxells</hi> of <hi>Flanders,</hi> told it afterward vnto me; and this it was.</p>
            <p>The foresaid Gentleman hauing dealt in matters of great importance with many Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusants of our Countrey, it so fell out, that one of them (whom for many respects I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare to name) was taken &amp; committed close prisoner in <hi>London</hi>; and because waighty mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters had passed betwixt the prisoner and the foresayd Gentleman touching landes, and other affayres, and therby was like to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue

And (thus resolued) he sent <hi>Edmund</hi> who was not yet 17. yeares of age, to effect that enterprize which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe could not performe; and this he only im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed vpon him, not directing him how it was possible to be atcheiued.</p>
            <p>The youth hauing his charge, went with all readines, committing his cause to God, <hi>Quia non erit impossibile apud Deum omne ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bum,</hi> for that nothing is impossible to God.<note place="margin">His hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse in his Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse.</note> Determining therfore to do (as a trusty ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant) what did lye in him, and thinking on no other meanes, he tooke vp his lodging neere to the prison, hoping in time to get ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quayntance
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:3207:14"/>
with the keeper or his man, and so to bring to passe his intended purpose. Neyther was his hope frustrate, for within few dayes he so ordered the matter, as he fell into great familiarity with the said keepers man, who (as God would haue it) had the charge of the forsaid close prisoner: and to be briefe, in short time he dealt so iudiciously in his busines, that he did not only procure to speake with the said prisoner, but also to haue accesse vnto him three or foure times with paper and incke, to write his mind; and in the end concluded all thinges so effectually, as if his mayster had beene present, which was no small meruayle to all those that were in daunger, or priuy to the same.</p>

This
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:3207:15"/>
his purpose he disclosed vnto his man <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund,</hi> with good counsayle and perswasion to remayne firme in his fayth and religion.</p>
            <p>But when our youth vnderstood his Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters resolution, he cryed out with like wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des to those of S. <hi>Laurence, QuÃ² vadit Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster sine seruo? quÃ² Pater sine Filio?</hi> Whither go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth my maister without his man?<note place="margin">In vita Sancti Laurent</note> Whither goeth my father without his sonne? And with teares distilling from his eyes he humbly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated he might go togeather with him; Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as it were with <hi>S. Peter; Domine,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luc. 22.</note> 
               <hi>tecum pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratus sum, &amp; in carcerem, &amp; in mortem ire:</hi> Mayster, I am ready to go with you any whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to prison, yea to death. But the good Gentleman forecasting his future ability,<note place="margin">His gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>efe that he must forsake his Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</note> as also to try his spirit yet a little further, made him answere, that it was impossible. To which our <hi>Edmund</hi> replyed. Alas! and is it impossible? Shall my natiue soyle restrayne freewill? or home-made lawes alter deuout resolutions? Am I not yong? Can I not stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy? May I not in time get what you haue gotten? learning for a scholler? yea vertue for a Priest perhaps, and so at length obtayne
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:3207:16"/>
that, for which you are now ready? Direct me the way, I beseech you, and let me (if you please) be your precursor. Tell me what I shal do, or whither I must go, and for the rest, God, who knowes my desire, will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide and supply the want. Can it be possible that he that clotheth the lyllies in the field, and feedeth the foules of the ayre, will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake him that forsaketh all to fulfill his diuine precept. <hi>Seeke first the Kingdome of God, and his iustice,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matt. 6.</note> 
               <hi>and all other thinges shall be giuen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you?</hi> Finally he ended (to the admiration of his mayster) recyting the wordes of our Sauiour: <hi>Qui reliquerit domum, vel fratres, aut sorores, aut patrem, aut matrem &amp;c. propter me, centuplum accipiet,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matt. 19 Luc. 18.</note>

            <p>By these motions repeated with great fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of spirit, his Mayster well perceyued God Almightyes calling in him, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore willingly condescended to let him take his aduenture. And so procuring him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:3207:16"/>
to the English Seminary at <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and furnishing him with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney sufficient for such a iourney,<note place="margin">His pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing ouer the seas.</note> he dismissed him to shift for himself, his maister being not able to warrant his owne passage. And thus in all loue and affection, the maister and man parted. At which time he was little aboue 17. yeares of age, and presently without the knowledge of his other friendes, he went to <hi>Grauesend,</hi> and ther he vsed such diligence (God Almighty withall concurring) that he passed the seas, and safely arriued at his intended port, from whence he trauayled to <hi>Rhemes,</hi> being the shelter of all his comfort; so forcible was the hand of God. And there he found that Right Worthy President <hi>D. Allen</hi> (afterward Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall) ready to intertayne him with all fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly affection.</p>
            <p>No sooner was he receyued into the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, but with all diligence and alacrity,<note place="margin">His ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation at Rhemes.</note> he applyed his studyes, mixing with his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious thoughts great desires and endeauours to obtayne vertue, and religious deuotion. Neyther laboured he in vayne, for in short time he so much profited, that as of many
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:3207:17"/>
he was affected for his amiable and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward behauiour; so was he for his true zeale, and inward vertues, of most intirely beloued and admired, but of none misliked. It were too long to shew in particuler his perfect o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience and resignation of himself to the will of his Superiours, his humility annexed with his exceeding patience, as I my selfe haue heard his sayd Superiours make report of him; one amongst others by occasion tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of him in writing, gaue this Censure.</p>

               <hi>humilis ad obediendum: erat in Christo deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, in fide firmus, in bonis operibus promptus, in sermone verissimus, in bonitate conspiouus, &amp; in charitate praeclarus: Vexabatur frequenter, tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat patienter: Erat in eo in cunctis operibus dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretio, &amp; imitabilis erga omnes dilectio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Edmund Geninges was prouident and wise to giue or aske counsell, humble to obey: he was deuout to Christ, in fayth firme, prompt in good workes, most true in his worde, in goodnesse conspicuous, and in charity ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent: he was often vexed and sicke, he suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered all patiently; there was euer in him, in
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:3207:17"/>
all his actions discretion, and towards all sorts of people loue, worthy of Imitation.</p>
            <p>He was indeed of a very weake constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of body, and not able therby to endure any great hardnes, by meanes wherof at the first, by taking some extraordinary paynes, partly in his study, and partly in his spirituall exercises, he fell into great sicknes, for which visitation he was much pittyed,<note place="margin">His sic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knes at Rhemes.</note> and his case greatly lamented by many. And being not able to go forward in his Course by reason therof, by the direction of his Superiours, he had thought to haue abridged his longer Courses of study, and onely haue heard Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Diuinity and Cases of Conscience. But as he changed his mind, so did a continuall ague, and other infirmityes still molest him, which at length brought him into a most dangerous consumption; in so much as the Phisitians despayred of his recouery. This when the President vnderstood, he thought it best, and for the youths greatest good, to send him into England, in hope that change of ayre would worke some new effect. And so resoluing, he furnished him with all thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:3207:18"/>
necessary for his iourney.</p>
            <p>The younge man yielded willingly to the aduise of his Superiour for obedience sake, but with much griefe, and anguish of mind, that through want of age and learning,<note place="margin">His de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture towards England.</note> he could not enioy so great a benefit, as was holy Priesthood, the only thing he came for. He also much feared his owne weakenes, least his Protestant friendes should by theyr daungerous snares, and allurements intangle him in his Religion. Neuerthelesse he depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted towards <hi>England,</hi> and came to <hi>Newhauen,</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> where finding 2. or 3. banished English Priests (to whome he was commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded) he stayed with them expecting passage.</p>
            <p>But listen I pray you a while, what befell vnto him. Did he attayne <hi>England,</hi> the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended scope of his trauaile? No verily, for then had not the Doctours Prophecy bene veryfied,<note place="margin">His lying sick at New ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</note> to witt, that his returne should be a comfortable ioy, and a ioyfull comfort to all that loued him. But what befell him? These religious Priests laboured earnestly to obtayne passage, the passenger prayed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoutly for health, or safe conduct: and thus
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:3207:18"/>
spending the restlesse time for the space of one fortnight, at the length they chaunced vpon a shippe fraught for <hi>London,</hi> in which they procured him passage, and preparing him victualls, and all thinges necessary for his iourney, acquaynted him therwith, that he might be ready, when the Maister of the ship should call.</p>
            <p>But on the other side, although whiles he made his abode in this place, he had bene assaulted with diuers fitts of intolerable griefes, as themselues had bene eye witnesses, yet now vpon the suddayne he desired a little longer respite to debate and waygh the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for that he himselfe (as he sayd) greatly amended: and if (quoth he) there be any hope of recouery, I would be very loth to hazard my selfe in so great ieopardy, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially being not armed with the armour of proofe, which I came for,<note place="margin">His ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire not to go back in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland.</note> to wit Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. These vertuous men aforesaid hauing bargayned with the shipper for his pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, halfe displeased, perswaded him earnestly to take that good opportunity: but he with bashfull modestye, craued theyr patience,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:3207:19"/>
declaring what extraordinary motions had caused that vnaccustomed kind of dealing, protesting that he found himselfe at that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant greatly amended, and almost aswell as euer he was. Which strange speaches not without great admiration, inforced them to cease theyr suite, and breake out into these termes: <hi>Digitus Dei hic: haec mutatio dextrae Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celsi.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 8. Psal. 76.</note> The finger of God is heere: this change comes from the right hand of the Highest.</p>
            <p>Hence admiring his Saintely affability, and mild behauiour, with all contentment they condescended to his desires.<note place="margin">His sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den reco<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uery of a langui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing di<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sease.</note> And he truly on the very next day, made such a shew of recouery, that he was able with a stomake to eate his meate, to go a good long walke, and such like tokens he gaue of health, by doing much more then he was able to do before, that it was wonderfull. Wherupon the sayd good Priests resolued to cherish him a while, and so to send him back agayne to <hi>Rhemes.</hi> And finally, within another fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, he was so strong, that he departed towardes <hi>Rhemes,</hi> where not long after he arriued to his owne vnspeakeable ioy, and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:3207:19"/>
the comfort of his Superiours, and friendes in the Colledge.</p>
            <p>O that I could heere declare, or as it were <hi>rudi Minerua</hi> expresse the inscrutable determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation &amp; proceedings of God Almighty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards this his chosen Martyr! Is it not true that holy Dauid sayth, <hi>Behold the eyes of our Lord, are euer ouer those that feare him,</hi>

               <hi>and such as hope in his mercy?</hi> And is not that of the Wiseman veryfied,<note place="margin">Sap. 81.</note> 
               <hi>VVisedome disposeth all thinges sweetly?</hi> Who euer saw, or heard of a disease so incurable as was his, being that he was farre spent with a long consumption, recouered naturally without a miracle in so short a time, and altogeather cured without any help of physicke? But, <hi>Opera Dei admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio nostra,</hi> Gods workes are our wonders. Well let vs returne to our new recouered Champion,<note place="margin">His zeal towards his affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>untrey.</note> who shaking of all feare of a new fall into sicknes, and hauing expelled all the cold fits of a shiuering feauer, with other languishing griefes of body, began now in soule to burne with exceeding cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and religious zeale towards his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys good. Wherfore taking to himselfe a
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:3207:20"/>
strong resolution he determined to arme him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe with such furniture, as time and place would affoard, and so to giue a present onsett to his enemyes, neyther fearing theyr new-made Lawes, nor other torments whatsoeuer, but blazing this for his poesie, <hi>Si Deus nobiscum, quis contra nos?</hi> If God be with vs, who can be agaynst vs?</p>
            <p>O how often haue I heard his Collegian fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes recite vnto me his euer vsed phrase when occasion was offered him to talke of <hi>England,</hi> and Martyrdome therin, which was, <hi>Viuamus in spe, Viuamus in spe</hi>: let vs liue in hope, let vs liue in hope! But his inward sweet inspirations being vnknowne to his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours, they now agayne began by all me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anes to perswade him to take his whole time in the course of his studies, shewing him that want of yeares must needs be his hinderance from being Priest so soone as he desired,<note place="margin">His ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</note> which impediment being by him perceyued, his intention of a speedy course (proceeding from his fiery flames of burning charity towards his Countrey) was therby a little asswaged, yet the cause being not extinguished, it brake
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:3207:20"/>
forth agayne within a while after with such ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemency, as being not able represse it any longer, he began a new, and more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest suite to the President, to obtayne Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. And to excuse his want of yeares he alledged such reasons, that the sayd President with the Seniours of the Colledge debating and discussing the matter maturely, thought it expedient, considering on the one side his decayed body, &amp; on the other his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quencheable thirst of mind to gayne soules to God in our vnfortunate Countrey, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure him a dispensation to be made Priest, which in short time they performed to his vnspeakeable comfort.</p>

            <p>Now he began more carefully to gather vp fragrant flowers of diuers colours, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decke his English garland. Humility by due desert chalendged the first place. Patience inflamed with burning Charity possessed the next.

of Priesthood, of the great charge he was to vndertake, and of the exact account he was to render; yea he shaked and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at the wordes of the Prophet <hi>Malachy, Labia Sacerdotis custodient scientiam,</hi>

This office he very thankefully vndertooke, and hauing now matter to worke vpon, he so laboured about the sicke Students, euen in the basest offices, that he was called the very patterne of piety, and humility: his commiseration was so great, as he might well haue sayd with holy <hi>Iob, Miseratio ab infantia mea creuit mecum</hi>:<note place="margin">Iob. 31.</note> mercy and pitty hath growne and increased with me euen from my infancy.</p>

               <note place="margin">His ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of shippe.</note> where presently they endeauoured to procure a speedy, and (if it might be) a safe passage. And behold after two or three dayes aboad there, they found an vnexpected and alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether vnwonted vessel fraught for England, whose maister was a Frenchman, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion well affected. This man imagining (as it may be supposed) what they were, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered them vnrequested safe passage, and to set them a shore by night, if they so pleased: who with ioyful harts accepted of his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yielding harty thankes to God for his goodnes, and care towards them, as also to him for his friendly offer.</p>
            <p>On the next day committing themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:3207:25"/>
to the tuition of theyr high Protectour God Almighty, they tooke shipping; and wind and weather being both prosperous, they sayled along the coast of <hi>England,</hi> and meant to haue landed on <hi>Essex</hi> side: but for theyr sakes the Maister of the Barke lingered that euening, vntill it was two houres within night, and being come neere vnto <hi>Scarbrough,</hi> there came out a little boate with diuers Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, or Pyrates in it, to haue surprised them, who shot at them diuers tymes with muskets, but had no harme; for the wind being then somwhat contray, the maister turned his ship and sayled backe into the mayne sea, where in foule weather they remayned three dayes; and so at last being driuen Eastward, they landed neere vnto <hi>VVhitby</hi> in <hi>Yorkeshire,</hi> on the side of a high Cliffe, with great danger of theyr liues. At last they came to <hi>VVhitby,</hi>
               <note place="margin">How he was set on shore</note> where going into an Inne to refresh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>selues, they found there one <hi>Ratcliffe</hi> a Purseuant, who after an exact view of them all, questioned with them about their ariuall in that place, whence they came, and whither they would? They answered, that comming from <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>castle,</hi>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:3207:26"/>
they were by tempest driuen thither. And so after refreshing of themselues, they went all to a Catholike Gentleman his house (whose name for diuers respects I suppresse) within 2. or 3. myles of <hi>VVhitby,</hi> by whome they were directed some to one place, some to another, according to their owne desires.</p>
            <p>Being thus ech one sent to seuerall places, <hi>M. Geninges</hi> with one other kept togeather, who trauayling by the way,<note place="margin">How they sepa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rated the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>

And whiles they thus resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, they came to two fayre beaten wayes, the one tending Northeast, the other South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>east: &amp; euen then, and there (it being in the night) they stayed, and fell both downe on their knees, making a short prayer togeather, that Almighty God of his infinite mercy would vouchsafe to respect his hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ble Seruants, and send them peaceable passage into the thickest of his vineyard. Then rysing vp, they imbraced one another with teares trick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling downe their cheeks. Thus <hi>Edmund</hi> tooke
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:3207:26"/>
his leaue.</p>

And also as we began, so wee may end together in Christ Iesus. Thus being not able to speake one word more for griefe and teares, they departed with mutuall silence, the one directing his iourney towards <hi>London,</hi> because he was borne there, the other North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, because he was affected that way.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>LMIGHTY GOD the authour of all good motions, by his holy spirit, first directed this our blessed Priests will &amp; purpose to draw neare to his owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Countrey, that he might profit and take some care of his owne particuler friendes,<note place="margin">His re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payring to his owne Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.</note> &amp; kinsfolkes. Comming therfore to the Citty where he was borne, halfe a yeare after his ariuall, he found most of his nearest friends and allyes to be all dead, except one brother,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:3207:28"/>
whom he heard to be in <hi>London,</hi> but in what place he could not at that time conueniently learne. And though he feared least that too much enquiry should breed suspition, yet brotherly charity could not forbeare, but prouoked him forward to seeke his lost-sheep whom he well knew to be infected with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious disease of his soule. Hence presently he we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t to <hi>London,</hi> where like a good sheepheard he left no place vnsought, where he might suspect his said Brothers aboad. And thus spe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ding a moneth at the least, &amp; seing no hope to preuayle, he resolued to leaue the Citty for a season. But God whose secret proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence passeth all human vnderstanding (when the time of his departure drew neere) vnex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly, and as it were <hi>digito,</hi> with his finger, directly pointed him to the obiect that he so long sought to behold, yet very strangely: and thus it was, as I haue heard from his owne mouth.</p>
            <p>Hauing (as I haue sayd) a determination to leaue <hi>London</hi> for a while, he walked forth of his Inne one morning (certayne dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had purposed to trauayle) to visit
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:3207:28"/>
a friend of his on the other side of the Citty, he lying then in <hi>Holborne</hi>; and passing by <hi>S. Paules</hi> Church, when he was on the East side therof, he suddaynly felt a great distempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in his body, in so much as his face glowed, and as he thought his hayre stared, and all his ioynts trembling for feare, his whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy seemed to be bathed in a cold sweat.<note place="margin">A sudda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine feare came v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon him as he went in the streets at the sight of his Brother.</note> This strange accident of the alteration of his body causing him to feare some euill to be immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent towards him, or daunger of taking, he looked backe to see if he could espy any to pursue him: but perceyuing no body to be neare, but only a yong youth in a browne coloured cloake, making no reflexion who it should be, he went forward to his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded place, to say Masse that day; taking co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in that saying of the Psalmist, <hi>Iacta co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitatum tuum in Domino, &amp; ipse te enutriet</hi>: put thy trust in our Lord, and he will nourish and protect thee.</p>
            <p>Behold heere the loue of Almighty God, who gaue him a sight of his brother whome he sought for, though he passed by him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out salutation, the one of them not knowing
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:3207:29"/>
the other. But was this all the fauour that God shewed to this his elected Martyr? Had he only a bare sight without knowledge? No, no. Attend the sequele. Not long after, the very morning before he purposed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part out of the towne, the blessed man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collecting himselfe in his deuotions, serious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prayed, that his departure without fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of his desired brother might increase his patience: and although it grieued him sore yet did he cry, <hi>Fiat voluntas tua,</hi> my will is thy will,<note place="margin">The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of the same feare.</note> sweet Lord, thy will be done. His deuotions being finished, he went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad to another place where he had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to celebrate Masse that day before his departure: which done, as he was retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning homewards towards his Inne, vpon <hi>Ludgate</hi> hill, suddaynly as he was going, he felt the same motions as he had done the time before: for heat striued to expell cold, and cold heate, all his ioynts trembled, as dreading some great trouble, or misfortune to ensue: and as alwayes the silly lambe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally feareth the rauening wolfe; so his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency fearing the worst, looked backe to see
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:3207:29"/>
who followed him. And behold no man of marke, but a youth in a browne coloured cloake: and at the same instant reflecting on the time past when he suffered the like per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity, and stedfastly viewing the yonge man, presently he was stroken with this cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>This</hi> (quoth he) <hi>may be my brother.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And let no man meruayle that he could not know him by his fauour, for he had not seene him in the space of eight or nine yeares before,<note place="margin">His first know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> and he left him a very little boy in the Countrey, and then was much al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered (as I haue heard) almost from white to blacke. Well, the aforesayd apprehension was so vehement, that it caused him to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the youth, &amp; being come vnto him he courteously saluted him, and enquired what Countrey-man he was; and hearing he was a Stafford-shire man, gently demaunded his name? Who made answere, his name was <hi>Geninges,</hi> by which he knew certaynly he was his brother so long looked for. Then with a glaunce towards heauen, in lieu of louing thankes, and with a smiling coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance vpon the party, he told him he was
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:3207:30"/>
his poore kinsman, and was called <hi>Ironmon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> and that he was very glad to see him well: and thus they walked downe <hi>Ludgate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill,</hi> he questioning of al his friends, and in particuler about himselfe, asking what was become of his brother <hi>Edmund.</hi> The youth not suspecting him to be the same man, told him, he had heard he was gone to <hi>Rome</hi> to the Pope, and was become a notable Papist, &amp; traytour both to God and his Countrey, and that if he did returne and were taken, he would be hanged infallibly.</p>
            <p>Our sweet Martyr hearing this, and smi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at the boyes folly, told him, <hi>Edmund</hi> was his eldest brother,<note place="margin">His com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>munica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with his brother.</note> &amp; therfore (quoth he) you ought to speake well of him: he added, that he himselfe had heard, that he was a very honest man, &amp; loued both the Queene and his Countrey, but God aboue all: yet tell me good cosin <hi>Iohn</hi> (quoth he) do you not know him if you see him? To which <hi>Iohn</hi> answered, No, he could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member eyther visage or stature. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing then he began to suspect and feare that he was his brother, and a Priest: yet
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:3207:30"/>
neuerthelesse not knowing what a Priest was, boldly told him, he could not tell what he was, yet that he greatly dreaded, he had a brother a Papist Priest, and that he was the man; swearing withall, that if it were so, he would discredit himselfe and all his friendes, if he were so proued, and protesting in that he would neuer follow him, although in other matters he would greatly respect him.</p>
            <p>Which wordes <hi>Edmund</hi> hearing, could no longer conceale himself from his suspitious brother, but told him truely, he was his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther indeed, and for his loue, had taken great paynes to come to seeke him, perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him to keepe in secret the knowledge of his arriuall. To which the youth answered, he would not for a world disclose his returne,<note place="margin">His bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers fea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur the law for not reue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ling him</note> but yet he desired him to come no more vnto him, for that he feared greatly the daunger of the law, that being he was his brother, he should incurre the penalty of the Statute newly made in concealing him. The good Man hearing this, thought it neyther time nor place conuenient (being then in a tauerne) to talk of religion, he being
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:3207:31"/>
but a waggish youth: only he told him he was deceyued, for that he was no such man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of man as he tooke him for: neyther was I (sayth he) euer at <hi>Rome,</hi> or with the Pope, but only haue trauayled in other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys, for which fact there is no such punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment appoynted by the law.</p>
            <p>To conclude, much talke they had about diuers thinges, by which the good Priest well perceyued his poore brother farre from any good affection to Catholike religion, but rather wilfully giuen to persist in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testancy, withour any hope of a present re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couery. And therfore declaring vnto him his present departure out of towne, tooke his leaue, assuring him, that within one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth or little more he intended to returne, at which time he would see him agayne,<note place="margin">His de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from his brother, and fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well.</note> and conferre with him more at large about some necessary affayres which concerned him very much. And thus the two brethren par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the one to do his function, in conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of soules, the other to meditate how to corrupt his owne; and so the one went to spend his time in studying how to perswade;
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:3207:31"/>
the other how to withstand: the one purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to make hast backe agayne hoping to saue a soule, brothers loue him therunto prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king; the other wished his brothers neuer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, through feare of conuersion, licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious liberty brothers loue peruerting.</p>

and other deuout people who came thither on that day for the same purpose, <hi>M. VVelles</hi> himself being from home, and out of the towne.</p>
            <p>But behold when he was euen at the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration of the holy body and bloud of our Sauiour, one M. <hi>Topliffe</hi> with other officers knocked at the dore.

            <p>He also firmely fixed in his tender hart, the memory of our Lords wrongfull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation,<note place="margin">His pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience in suffering iniuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des.</note> and bitter Passion, as a sure bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warke for his defence agayinst the assaults of all their bitter accusations. I cannot here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite all the occasions of merit offered to these blessed Confessours by the Iuges. Neyther is it my purpose to set downe in particuler, all the taunts, threats, calamniations, and exaggerations which agaynst euery one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> they thundered out. But any man, but of a meane vnderstanding may easily imagine them to be great, seing that they who vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them were throughly practised in such like exercises.

            <p>On the morrow, the prisoners were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed through the streetes with a great trayne, euery one being led betweene two men with

But now began a new combat. <hi>M.

            <p>They were no sooner departed, but the glorious Confessours all imbraced one the other,<note place="margin">His en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes in the Com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bat</note> and mutually encouraged themselues to sustayne the future assault, as they had done the combat already past, to the great edification of many standers by. But <hi>M. Geninges</hi> especially perswaded them all with a pleasant sweet speach (in the hearing of

many Catholikes) not to yield one iote to any of theyr enemyes allurements, animating them with the saying of <hi>S. Iames, Appropin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate Deo, &amp; appropinquabit vobis:</hi> Approach to God, and he will approach to you. And so they passed all the time of the Counsells dinner within the barre in prayer and exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to perseuerance. In the meane time their aduersaryes hard harts affoarded them not one bit of bread, or drop of drinke for theyr sustenance, so that they stood all that day without any refreshing, or bodily nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment.</p>

To be briefe the verdict was giuen vp, and the Priests were all found guilty of high treason for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning into the Realme, contrary to the law prouided in that behalf; and all the lay peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple both men and women were found guilty

remembrance the saying of <hi>S.

calling <hi>M. Geninges</hi> from forth the dungeon where they had layd him, they promised him both life and liberty, if he would go to theyr Church, and renounce his Religion. And although they found him euer in his answeres both then and at the barre, very constant and resolute; yet they ceased not still to pursue their intentions, hoping at length to gayne him, because they imagined his tender yeares could not still withstand their forcible charmes: forcible I say, for what sweet allurements can be more forcible then life, liberty, liuing, &amp; promotion to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned captiue?</p>

Hence he resolued and was able to withstand a million of like batteryes, if they could had happened. At length they finding him so constant, and immoueable, waxing angry, they furiously put him into a certayne hole within the prison, whence he could neither get vp, nor downe without hazard of breaking his necke, which was also so darke that he could not see his owne handes. There he remayned in prayer and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation without all food or sustenance to the hower of his death, desiring God of his infinite godnesse to giue him constancy &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seuerance (as he had done in his former co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>

If to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne into England Priest, or to say Masse be Popish treason, I heere confesse I am a traytour; but I thinke not so.

were very little astonished, in so much that the Hangman was forced to trippe vp his heeles from vnder him to make him fall on the blocke. And being dismembred, through very payne, in the hearing of many, with a lowde voyce he vttered these wordes, <hi>Oh it smartes</hi>; which <hi>M.

            <p>But now attend, I beseech you, how the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his martyrdome was declared and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by an euident signe,<note place="margin">The ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques.</note> shewed by the hand of Almighty God, who by diuine testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony manifested to the world the truth of his cause, &amp; the greatnes of his reward, making knowne also how acceptable a thing it is in his sight to esteeme highly and reuerence the sacred reliques of his chosen Saynts.

            <p>Amongst the rest there was a Virgin who had wholy dedicated her selfe to the seruice of God.

Verily whosoeuer readeth it, shall find the intercession of this Saint to haue bene the only cause (next after God)

of all his good. I haue declared already how little hope there was of his Conuersion, when his brother was liuing: for although he was young, yet was he obstinate, and rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clyned to a Puritanicall spirit, then any way fauouringe the Catholike doctrine, nay he was euer brought vp where he neuer heard any good report of a Catholike, no not so much, as that they were honest men.</p>
            <p>I haue likewise shewed the great desire the blessed Martyr had to bring his Brother to be a member of the Catholike Church,<note place="margin">The ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinacy of his brother before his Con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uersion</note> &amp; the great care he tooke for his conuersion. I haue further sett downe the Martyrs strange manner of finding him; and being found, the vnbrotherly salutation he gaue the finder, whose behauiour was such, as time and place would not giue leaue once to speake of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Finally I haue mentioned, that the cause of the holy Martyrs co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ming to <hi>London</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> he was taken, specially was his brother <hi>Iohns</hi> loue: but indeed he was martyred before euer he could see him, and so he neuer vsed vnto him any perswasions or reasons for Religion, nor yet commended he him to any one friends
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:3207:50"/>
care, so hastened was his vnexpected death. Now I will truly relate the manner of his Conuersion, being it cannot but redound highly to the glory of God, and honour of the blessed Martyr, who by his prayers ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned that in heauen, which he himselfe could not effect on earth. Thus then it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened.</p>
            <p>This Martyrs Brother called <hi>Iohn Geninges</hi> being in <hi>London</hi> at the very time of our Cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons apprehension, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>demnation, &amp; execution, hearing of the same, rather reioyced, then any way bewayled the vntimely &amp; bloudy end of his nearest allyed, hoping therby to be rid of all perswasions, which he mistrusted he should receyue from him touching Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique religion.<note place="margin">The oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>uer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</note> And through blind wilfulnes intending to withstand all spirit of grace, he therfore neglected, yea rather scorned to go to see his brother, eyther imprisoned, arraigned, or martyred; such was the fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward blindnes of his heresie. But about ten dayes after his execution towards night, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing spent all that day in sport and ioylity, being weary with play, he resorted home,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:3207:50"/>
where to repose himselfe he went into a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret chamber. He was no sooner there set downe, but forthwith his hart began to be heauy, and his head melancholy, and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to waygh how idlely he had spent that day. When he was entred into such conceits, there presently was represented vnto his mind a strange imagination, and apprehension of the death of his Brother, and amongst other thinges, how he did forsake not long before all worldly pleasure, &amp; for his Religion only indured intollerable torments.</p>
            <p>Thus within himselfe he made long dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses concerning his Religion and his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, comparing the Catholike manner of liuing with his, and finding the one to desire payne, the other pleasure, the one to liue strictly, the other licentiously, the one to feare sinne, the other to runne into all kind of syn, being stroken with exceeding ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and remorse, he wept bitterly, desiring God, after his fashion, to illuminate his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, that he might see and perceyue the truth. O what great ioy &amp; consolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on felt he at that instant! Nay what reuerence
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:3207:51"/>
on the suddayne began he to beare to the B. Virgin and the Saynts of God, which before he had neuer scarse heard talke of! What strange motions, as it were inspirations, with exceeding readines of will to chaunge his Religion, possessed his soule! And what a heauenly conceipt had he now of his deare brothers felicity! He imagined then he saw him;<note place="margin">His bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers vow and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fomance</note> he thought he heard him. In this extasy of mind he stayd not long, before he vowed, as he lay prostrate on the ground, to forsake kinred and Countrey to finde out the true knowledge of his brothers fayth, which he soone after performed (although with much difficulty) and departed England without aduertising anyone of his friendes, and went beyond the seas to performe his former promise. Finally he attributed his Conuersion wholy (next after God) to the intercession of his blessed brother.</p>
            <p>And truely no man according to reason can otherwise imagine, seing of a Protestant he became a Catholike in fayth, without perswasion or conference with any one man in the world.<note place="margin">His fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>

               <p>He was the youngest sonne of <hi>Thomas VVelles</hi> Esquire, and brother to that Worthy Confessor <hi>Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert VVelles</hi> Esquire, whose immoueable constancy a midst so many,<note place="margin">His birth &amp; family</note> &amp; so great persecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>s vnder the late Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> hath beene highelie Honorable vnto the Cath. Cause, establishing a happy poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity behind hym, enriched with the ample inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of his approued vertues.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Swithune</hi> being vertuously educated from his infancy, &amp; carefully instructed in all manner of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning fitting that age, as he was very pregnant of wit &amp; vnderstanding; so by his especiall industry and diligence he became so singularlie qualified, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the studies of humanitie,<note place="margin">His ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation</note> as he not onely equalled, but far excelled most of his fellowes.

               <p>From studies he fell to other laudable exercises fitting his degree, but being now growen to some riper yeares, hee tooke to wife a vertuous Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman, who togeather with himselfe being most vniustely condemned to death, after a longe and hard imprisonment yielded her blessed soule into the handes of her Creator, in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>stant confession of our Holy Fayth, in the prison of <hi>Newgate,</hi> in the yeare of our Lord 1602.</p>
               <p>In this estate as he grew more mature in age, so
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:3207:54"/>
he did in vertues. To the prouident care of a good maister of a family he adioyned many other excellent imployments, highlie to his prayse and honour. For although he were much delighted in hauking, hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and other such Gentleman-like sportes, yet he so soberly gouerned his affections therein,<note place="margin">His ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise in riper yeares.</note> that he was content to depriue himselfe of a great part of those pleasures, &amp; retire to a more profitable im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of trayning vp young Gentlemen both in vertue &amp; learning: wherin he had such happy suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse, that his Schoole hath byn as it were a fruitfull Seminary to many worthy members of the Catholik Church, whereof one hath already gayned the crown of martyrdome, others yet remaine, some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious &amp; paynefull workmen in the happy har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest of soules, &amp; some continue stro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>g &amp; immoueable pillars to support the Cath. Cause agaynst to many grieuous stormes, and tempestes as are daily raysed agaynst it.</p>
               <p>I shall not need heere to speake how temperate hee was in prosperitie, how contented in aduersitie. Yow shal heare himself an vndoubted witnes heer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, excellently expressing the same in his owne wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, taken out of a letter of his, directed vnto a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Gentleman <hi>M.
