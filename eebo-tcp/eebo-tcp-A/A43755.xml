            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The Text (as you ſee falls within the compaſs of Solomons bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing upon the repreſentatative body of the People of Iſrael.</p>
            <p>From the whole you may pleaſe to take notice of this Obſervation in the generall, which I ſhall but briefly touch upon.</p>
            <p>Doct. <hi>The Lords gracious preſence with his people inclining their hearts to keep his Commandements, and maintaining their cauſe; is a Sufficient means to Eſtabliſh the welfare of ſuch a people, even at their own hearts can wiſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For thus did Solomon bleſs the heads of the Tribes of Iſrael, and he had the hearts of the whole Congregation going along with him, that if the Lord would but grant his preſence with them, his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of them, and his protection over them, they had enough, they
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:96918:4"/>
could have no more, they could be no better in this world.</p>
            <p>And if we our ſelves now might have our wiſh, if the Lord ſhould ſay to us as <hi>Ahaſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

            <p>For, doth not <hi>Immanuel, God with us,</hi> comprehend our whole good? and the <hi>keeping of Gods Commandements</hi> containe our whole duty<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and is not the Lords maintaining the cauſe of his People enough to keep off whatever might interrupt or hinder us in the performing this duty, and enjoying that good wherein the utmoſt happyneſs of a People on this ſide Heaven doth conſiſt? Let theſe requeſts (there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) dwell upon the hearts of all the Lords People, let us bear them continually upon our hearts before the Lord, that as hitherto, ſo ſtill, he may graunt unto all his Servants, both Magiſtrates, Miniſters, and People, his Gracious preſence, divine aſſiſtance, and divine protection in the times that are come upon us. This is the Summe of all that we need or can receive, or can deſire whileſt we are here toſſed in the troubleſome ſea of this World, paſſing to the Haven of eternall reſt.</p>
            <p>But I ſhall not further inſiſt upon this. It is another Doctrine which I mainly intend from the latter part of the 59 <hi>verſe. That he maintaine the cauſe of his People at all times as the matter ſhall require.</hi> There are two things need a little opening here.</p>

            <p>Now the very ſame was the cauſe of his People Iſrael, for the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall end of the great aſſembly mentioned in this Chapter, it was to bring in the <hi>Ark of the Covenant</hi> into the houſe of the Lord: by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of which Covenant the Lord was their God and they were his people; and, the cauſe of God was theirs, and their cauſe was his; the cauſe of God &amp; his People Iſrael was one and the ſame, and that was the cauſe of Religion according to the word of God. Therefore in the Text here Solomon prayes that the hearts of his People might be <hi>enclined to walk in Gods wayes and to keep his Commandements.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againe, it is obſervable, the word rendred <hi>cauſe</hi> here in the text is tranſlated <hi>[right]</hi> in the Margine of the 45. <hi>&amp;</hi> 49. <hi>verſes,</hi> that he <hi>maintain the right of his People,</hi> there is a right unto houſe and land and the like, but there is a <hi>jus divinum,</hi> a ſpeciall divine right which the People of Iſrael had unto the one true Religion, and a liberty annexed unto that right that none could lawfully hinder them from enjoying all that belonged to the ſervice of God.</p>
            <p>So that (in one word) the <hi>cauſe of his people Iſrael</hi> was right from God, and liberty from God, to keep Gods Commandements in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion. This was the cauſe of God and Iſrael then, and I hope it will appear anon, that the very ſame is the cauſe of God and his people now.</p>
            <p n="2">2. What is meant by [the Lords maintaining this cauſe at all times as the matter ſhall require] He had made the ſame requeſt twice before <hi>verſe</hi> 45. <hi>&amp;</hi> 49. that he <hi>maintain his Peoples cauſe;</hi> here he mentions it againe the third time, that he <hi>maintain the cauſe of his People Iſrael,</hi> with an addition of this further expreſſion, <hi>at all times as the matter ſhall require.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He had before in his large Prayer comprehended all the common caſes which might fall out; but becauſe there might be other caſes which he could not foreſee, or they might be otherwiſe circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, when the cauſe of Iſrael might be ſo endangered, as there
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:96918:5"/>
would not be any help in the ey of reaſon in the ſight of Man, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he commends the cauſe of his People Iſrael to the Lord himſelfe, and leaves it with him, and beſeecheth him, that he by his preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive would maintain <hi>the cauſe of his people, even as the matter ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thoſe words in the Text <hi>[at all times]</hi> are in the Margine rend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red [<hi>the thing of a day</hi> in his day] <hi>i. e.</hi> not onely in the day of proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity when things go <hi>ſmoothly on;</hi> but in the dayes of adverſity, in the <hi>Hirracano's</hi> of tempeſtuous times, when it is a day <hi>of trouble and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke, and Blaſphemy,</hi> as is was in Hezekiahs time, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 37.3. in a day of perplexity and treading down, <hi>Iſai</hi> 22.5. in ſuch a day as this, the cauſe of God and Iſrael is Committed to the Lord himſelf that he would <hi>maintain it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And there is an Emphaſis to be obſerved in that word <hi>[He]</hi> that He <hi>maintain it,</hi> when there is none elſe that will, or can, or knowes how: implying the need (the extream need) that the people of Iſrael might ſometimes have for the Lord himſelfe <hi>to maintain their cauſe</hi> above all that themſelves, or any elſe ſhould be able to doe.</p>
            <p>So that the point of Doctrine which I would commend unto the conſideration of this preſent Aſſembly from hence, is this.</p>
            <p>

            <p>There is a mixture of Hypocrites amongſt the ſincere Servants of God, who pretend unto this cauſe as well as they; and hence many times not onely weakneſs but wickedneſs is inter-woven into the faireſt pretences to the cauſe of God.</p>
            <p>There are various apprehenſions, affections, and paſſions, amongſt good men. <hi>Moſes the Servant,</hi> and <hi>Aaron the Saint of the Lord,</hi> are ſometimes unadviſed: and when they are moſt upright, when they lead the People according to the <hi>

            <p>Sometimes <hi>(alas)</hi> there is a ſharp contention between <hi>Paul</hi> and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:96918:6"/>
               <hi>Barnabas:</hi> and Godly <hi>Peter doth not ever walk with a right foot:</hi> and bleſſed <hi>Paul</hi> when moſt faithfull and true, is under evill ſurmiſes, as a <hi>deceiver.</hi> There is names and parties of men, dividing Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them: ſome <hi>departing from the Faith,</hi> others led aſide from the ſimplicity of the Goſpel, <hi>on the right hand, and on the left,</hi> and many (in the laſt dayes very many) that <hi>have the form but deny the power of Godlyneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence the cauſe of Religion much obſcured and ready to be ſpoyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the hands of thoſe that profeſs to be the lovers of it. That is the firſt Reaſon.</p>

            <p>Thus in the ſtory of <hi>Exodus,</hi> Pharoah at firſt works, wiſely to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine, afterwards he works proudly to overtake and deſtroy the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael of God.

            <p>And if you look into <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.12. you ſhall find there in relation to the laſt times, it is ſaid, <hi>Wee to the inhabitants of the Earth, and of

            </p>
            <p>Now from hence (againe) the cauſe of Religion is much endang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered by the haters of it. That is the Second Reaſon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. The laſt Reaſon is taken from <hi>afflicting Providence,</hi> He (the great God) <hi>changeth the times and the ſeaſons, Dan.</hi> 2.21. the Hiſtory of the Church in all ages hath informed us of this, that after a time <hi>of peace,</hi> comes a time <hi>of trouble,</hi> after a time <hi>of l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And though it hath been queſtioned whether <hi>Diocleſians perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> or <hi>Julians Toleration</hi> were more pernicious to the Church of God, yet without queſtion neither of theſe was without the Providence of God.</p>
            <p>When the People of God know not how to uſe their peace and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, when they have contracted the guilt of the Sins of ſuch times, it is but righteous with the Lord to bring them into bondage, that they may know the ſervice of the Lord with ſuch a kind of Knowledg as <hi>Adam</hi> had after his fall, to know good by the want and evil by the feeling of it, <hi>by terrible thing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But from hence alſo the cauſe of Religion comes to be in the ſame condition as the ſhip in which the diſciples went when <hi>Chriſt</hi> was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep, there came down ſuch a <hi>ſtorm upon the L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">

               <hi>Gather up the Reaſons briefly.</hi>

            <p>If the lovers of the cauſe of Religion be ſo unable to preſerve it, if
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:96918:7"/>
the haters of it be ſo ſedulous to deſtroy it, and if the Lord himſelfe ſeem to withdraw from it; then it is no wonder if the times be ſuch, and the caſe be ſuch, as the maintaining of the cauſe of Religion doth need and require more then ordinary help from the Lord himſelfe.</p>
            <p>By this time you ſee the truth of the Doctrine. Now let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the good of it in <hi>Application to our ſelves,</hi> and that but in a couple of Uſes.</p>
            <p>The one for the <hi>Information of our Judgments.</hi>

            <p>The end of our comming hither was a reformation only of what was amiſs or defective in the churches we came from: from which we

            <p n="1">1. <hi>Not a toleration of all Religions,</hi> or of the <hi>Hereſies &amp; Idolatries</hi> of the age we live in.

How inconſiſtent would ſuch a toleration be, with the love of the one true Religion revealed in the word of God? would not ſuch a ſtate be guilty of having <hi>other Gods,</hi> where ſuch a toleration is? is it not the end of Civill Authority, that men may <hi>live a quiet &amp; peaceable life, in godlineſs as well as honeſty?</hi> but not in the wayes of ungodlineſs, no more then in the wayes of diſhoneſty: in a word, the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt hath a <hi>right para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount,</hi> all rights in the world, it hath a <hi>Divine &amp; Supream</hi> right to be received in every Nation, and the <hi>knee of Magiſtracie</hi> is to bow at the name of <hi>Jeſus.</hi> This right carryes <hi>liberty along with it,</hi> for all ſuch as profeſs the Goſpel, to walk according to the <hi>Faith &amp; Order of the Goſpell.</hi> That which is contrary to the Goſpel hath <hi>no right,</hi> and therefore ſhould have <hi>no liberty.</hi> But the Lawes which have been made by the Civill Government here, with reſpect unto Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, whereby you have declared your <hi>profeſſed ſubjection to the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,</hi> and your <hi>non-toleration</hi> of that which is <hi>contrary thereunto;</hi> this will be a name and a glory to New-England <hi>ſo long as the Sun and Moon endure.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:96918:9"/>There was Religion in the Churches from whence we came, but New-Englands deſign in this vaſt undertaking, it was Reformation <hi>i. e. the avoyding of ſome ſpecial corruptions, and the Vigorous profeſſion and practiſe of every thing, in Doctrine, worſhip and diſcipline, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Scripture patterne:</hi> as in <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.5. when Moſes was about to make the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> he was admoniſhed of God, <hi>ſaying, ſee that thou make it in all things according to the pattern ſhewed thee in the mount.</hi> And our Saviour ſaid unto his diſciples, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.20. <hi>teach them to obſerve all whatſoever I have Commanded.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This was and is our Cauſe, that Chriſt alone might be acknowledged by us, as the onely head, Lord, and Law-giver, in his Church, that his written word might be acknowledged as the onely Rule, that onely and all his Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions might be obſerved and enjoyed by us, and that with puritie and libertie, with peace and power.</hi> This was the end of our coming hither, this is our Cauſe, hence I humbly conceive that the conſent of the Synod here to the confeſſion of Faith by the Aſſembly of Weſtminſter, and the platform of Diſcipline publiſhed in the year 49 theſe for the ſubſtance of them, have carryed with them a declaration of the Faith and order of theſe Churches, and are ſo looked upon by the reformed Churches abroad, unto which may be added many other books of our divines of the ſame import: and the practiſe of theſe Churches ſo farr as we have attained.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>A progreſs in Reformation.</hi> I conceive our cauſe is, not barely, a Reformation, but a progreſs in reformation; it was the charge of our Saviour to the Church of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> hold faſt what thou haſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.11. it is alſo the duty of the People of God to go on unto Perfection, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1.</p>
            <p>A conceit of having allready attained a perfect reformation ſhould be farr from us: a true endeavour after a full reformation in the ſenſe of our many defects, is the duty and Spirit of ſincere Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians that advance the Word of God, as the onely perfect rule, not that we have already attained or are already perfect, (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks of himſelfe, <hi>Phi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Hence what we have attained in Doctrine, Worſhip &amp; Diſcipline, according to Gods Word, we muſt hold faſt and then go forward
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:96918:10"/>
unto any of the things of Chriſt, we are defective in, <hi>we muſt go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſtill, but not backward,</hi> I ſay not backward, <hi>at for Inſtance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Fathers fled into this Wilderneſs from the face <hi>of a Lording Epiſcopacie, and humane injunctions in the Worſhip of God: now if any of us their Children ſhould yeild unto, or be inſtrumentall to ſet up in this Country, any of the wayes of mens inventions, ſuch as Prelacie, impoſed Leiturgies, humane Ceremonies in the Worſhip of God, or to admit igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and Scandalous Perſons to the Lords Table, this would be a backſlide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing indeed:</hi> it would be a backſliding to the things which we and our Fathers have departed from, and have openly teſtified againſt, to be not of God, as in the Platform of Diſcipline, and many other wayes. Inſtance againe, if after ſuch a publick witneſs as hath been given amongſt us againſt a toleration of all Religions, there ſhould be a <hi>graduall yeilding to a toleration</hi> of any falſe Religion, (either by Law, or againſt Law, for want of the Execution of Laws,) this alſo would be a heinous backſliding which the Lords jealouſy will not bear. <hi>And for our Civil Government to put forth any act of conſent unto either of the former, would be a thing to be trembled at, and Prayed againſt, that the Lord would keep them from.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But on the other ſide: it is our duty to preſs forward ſtill to the mark; and to make a progreſs in reforming what ever is amiſs or defective a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, as in thoſe the late Synod hath pointed unto, about the ſubjects of Baptiſme, and conſociation of Churches.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That Baptiſme be adminiſtred to the Children of Church Members who have right thereunto. And that the Communion of Churches be better im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved amongſt us.</hi> Theſe are things we have been defective in, and therefore ſhould be reformed in a practicall way.</p>
            <p>And that we be very carefull there be no ſuperſtition amongſt us, nothing <hi>ſupra ſtatutum, in diſcipline</hi> no more then in worſhip <hi>that nothing be Impoſed as neceſſary unto Church-Memberſhip, which God hath not made neceſſary in his word; that there be no arbitrary way of Judging according to the private ſatiſfaction or dis-ſatisfaction of mens Spirit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The People of God ſincerely endeavouring Reformation, (yet
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:96918:10"/>
through inadvertencie, are ſubject to erre, either in defect or exceſs; and while they would avoyd one extream, to fall into another: the way of God in his word is a narrow way, there are extreames on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, the Lord requires it of us, that we neither turne to the right hand, nor to the left, that we neither add unto, nor take from, what he hath Commanded concerning the order of his houſe, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.26, 27. <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.32. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.5. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.20.

            <p>This was Holy counſell given to <hi>Job</hi> in the midſt of his plunges and diſtreſſes, <hi>Iob</hi> 5 8, 9. <hi>I would ſeek unto God, and unto God would I commit my Cauſe, which doth great things, and unſearchable, and mervel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous things without number, who diſappointeth the devices of the crafty, to ſet up on high thoſe that are low, that ſuch as mourne may be exalted unto ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> Say (Brethren I beſeech you) is not this that you would have, <hi>that the Cauſe of Religion, and thoſe that love it, may be in ſafety?</hi> then here is the way, for all the ſervants of God, to <hi>commit this cauſe unto him which doth great things and unſearchable, and marveilous things without number,</hi> unto him who hath maintained, who doth maintaine, and will maintain <hi>his Own and his Peoples Cauſe</hi> according to the Counſel of his own will, for the Praiſe of his Glorious Grace.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Now if it be demanded. But now ſhould we commit this Cauſe unto him, that he may be engaged in the maintaining of it, above all that we can aſk or think?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I Anſwer breifly in this one direction, (which will be uſeful to the Honoured worthies of the <hi>General Court,</hi> and yet will alſo reach the meaneſt in the Congregation) <hi>that you commit the ſafety

of this cauſe to the Lord himſelfe, in the ſame way as you do commit unto him the Salvation of your own ſoules,</hi> I ſay, that we do all commit this cauſe unto the Lord even in the ſame way as we do every one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit unto him the Salvation of our Soules.

            <p>As David in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.3, 5, 6. <hi>into thy hands I commit my Spirit, thou haſt redeemed me O Lord God of truth, for thou art my rock and my fortreſs, for thy name ſake lead me and guide me in thy way, for I hate lying Vanities, but I truſt in the Lord.</hi> Now in the very ſame way we ſhould all commit the ſafety of the Cauſe of Religion to the Lord himſelfe.</p>

And I doubt not but the <hi>General Court</hi> will take the caſe into Serious Conſideration after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, but for the preſent all ſhould be carefull that there may be a <hi>peaceable tranſaction</hi> of the <hi>publick affaire,</hi> and a <hi>peaceable Subjection</hi> to the <hi>Government</hi> here, and that all the People as one Man doe manifeſt their due ſenſe of the many, Bleſſings they have enjoyed under the preſent <hi>Government</hi> for ſo many years, that there may be conjoyned Prayers and endeavours for the continuance of it, according to the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:96918:14"/>
Patent, which under God and the King is to be acknowledged as the foundation of the civil <hi>Government</hi> here.</p>
            <p>It is now 35 <hi>year</hi> ſince I well Remember, in the <hi>year</hi> 28 that one of the firſt Miniſters that came over into this Wilderneſs, giving ſome account of his grounds in a great Aſſembly of many Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands at Leiceſter in Old-England, he mentioned this as one, the mercy of the Patent, and the largeneſs of the Patent, from the roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Authority of England, for the people here to chuſe their own Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, and to admit unto freedom ſuch as they ſhould think meet, and that Religion was the Principall end of this Plantation in his Majeſties Royal intention and the adventurers free poſſeſſion. This whole generation hath ſeen how good the Lord hath been unto us in this Wilderneſs for ſo many years under the <hi>Government</hi> ſetled here by the Patent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And therefore at in the matter of Religion we are to keep to the Word of God, ſo in the matter of the Civil Government keep to the Patent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus to <hi>be peaceable &amp; faithful in Iſrael,</hi> is the way of well doing, wherin we are to <hi>commit the maintaining of the Cauſe of Religion to the Lord our God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall now diſpatch the other two directions very breifly.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>In the way of humble Prayer,</hi> commit this Cauſe unto God by humble fervent and frequent Prayer as we are directed in the text: <hi>let theſe my Prayers be nigh to the Lord our God, that he maintain the Cauſe of his People Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the matter requires more then ordinary help from the Lord himſelfe, and yet the Lord ſeems to withdraw and to be aſleep, then the Servants of God muſt awaken him by their Importunate Prayers, as the diſciples in the ſtorm did awaken our Saviour, ſaying; <hi>Lord ſave us or we Periſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the People of God are faithfull to own his Cauſe, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, neither to fall ſhort of their duty nor to go beyond it, but keep in the narrow way of wel-doing and yet meet with ſuch ſtormes of Providence as they are at their Wits end what remaines then but Prayers &amp; tears? <hi>O our God we know not what to doe, but our eyes are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, Ariſe O Lord and plead thy own Cauſe.

            <p>When the Cauſe of Religion ſeemes ready to be ſpoiled by the profeſſors of it, and ready to be mined by the oppoſers of it, yet there is one in heaven that is able and faithfull, and watchfull, and ſkilful, for the preſervation of it, and therefore <hi>in quietneſs, and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, in returning and reſting ſhall we be ſaved,</hi> as the Prophet ſpeaks, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 30.15. we ſhould not onely ſubmit unto, but <hi>acquieſce</hi> and reſt in the Infinite Wiſdom and good pleaſure of God, that he may doe it in his own way, rejoicing in this, that <hi>the Lord Reignes over all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Give unto the Lord the Glory due unto his name, that he will not forſake his People,</hi> (he may afflict his People, and there may be need of it and Cauſe for it, but he will not forſake his People) for his <hi>great names ſake,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.22.</p>
            <p>And be comforted in this, that the ſafety of the Church Militant lyes upon the hand, and belongs to the care of Jeſus Chriſt; the ſhip of the Church may be endangered, it cannot be drowned ſo long as the Lord lives, he hath a thouſand wayes (that we know not of) for him to maintain his own and his Peoples Cauſe.</p>
            <p>Now unto him be Glory in the Church by Chriſt Jeſus throughout all ages, world without end. Amen.</p>
