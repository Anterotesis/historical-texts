         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

which was had on both sides in this royall mariage;
which religion began, and piety &amp; vertue hath

performed, is like this melodious modulation, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by

that with our earnest prayers and desires wee helpe

hath ioyned in matrimoniall affinitie diuers times,
with other adioyning countries, with Germanie,
France, Spaine: but with the two latter vnhappily:

wee see to all our comforts, the hopefull fruit of
matrimoniall amitie with Denmarke, which is

graunt vnto your Excellencies: The Lord Christ
turne your water into wine (with which miracle the

            <p>Among the Grecians, it was a fashion, when they

tooke away the gall from the rest of the sacrifice, sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying
thereby that there should be no bitternes
in mariage. But our holy Apostle much better dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth
husbands not to be bitter to their wiues, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loss.

grace God will send, we trust, to this sacred mariage.
<pb facs="tcp:20718:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Lastly, this most happie mariage we hope to see fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished,
and accompanied with store and plentie of
all blessings: which Christ our Lord decreed in
heauen: the King our Soueraigne ratified in earth:
The most worthie Archbishop as a spirituall father

            <p>And so I conclude, wishing vnto both your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies
that blessing, which the Elders of Israel
gaue vnto Boaz and Ruth, <hi>The Lord make thy wife,
that commeth into thine house like Rachel, and like Leah,
which both did build the house of Israel,</hi> Ruth. 4. 11. And
as the Lord promised that <hi>Abrahams</hi> seed should be
as the starres of heauen, Gen. 22. 17. as <hi>Hierome</hi> well
saith, <hi>Abraham pro filijs claritas ostenditur astrorum:

first of the Bridegrome to vers. 10. and then of the Spouse
and Bride, vers. 10. to vers. 16. the Bridegroome is set forth,
first, by his beautie and eloquent speech, vers. 2. then by his

            <p>In the second part, first, the dutie of the Bride is prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,

by her companie and attendants, vers. 14. Fourthly, by her

here set foorth is threefold: her loyall <hi>obedience</hi> in harke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
vers. 10. her faithfull remembrance of her spouse in

is obedience, as the Apostle exhorteth, <hi>Wiues submit

they must doe it, <hi>as to the Lord:</hi> and it is a comely thing
<hi>as it is comely in the Lord,</hi> Coloss. 3. 18. it is both profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and seemely, or pleasant, that there should bee amitie
and concord betweene the man and wife: as it is in the
Psalme: <hi>ecce quam bonum &amp; iucundum: Behold how good
and pleasant a thing it is brethren to dwell together in vnity,</hi>
Psalm. 133. 1. many things are good and profitable, but
not pleasant, as affliction and chasticement, <hi>which at the
first seemeth not to be ioyous, but grieuous, but afterward it
bringeth the quiet fruit of righteousnesse,</hi> Heb. 12. 11. But
this domestical concord, is both fruitful &amp; delightful, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
and amiable, it bringeth gaine without paine. This
was imposed as a perpetual law in the beginning vpon we
man, <hi>Thy desire shall be subiect to thine husband, and he shall
rule ouer thee,</hi> Genes. 3. 16. Those women then inuert the

ciuill things, in that they went away with him, being sent
for into the field, not returning to take their leaue of their
father, Genes. 31. 3. and in spirituall, in giuing vnto <hi>Iacob</hi>
their images and strange gods with the rest of the familie,
(as is most like) to be made away, Genes. 35. 2. <hi>Zipporah,</hi>
though very loth, yet was content, by direction from her
husband (as is most probable) to circumcise her child, <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
being weake, and not able himselfe to do it, Exod. 4. 25.
But <hi>Iobs</hi> wife seemeth to haue been a peruerse and refracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
woman, who dispised his counsell in framing her selfe to
patience, (wishing her husband to curse God and die) that
he was faine to take her vp roundly, giuing her the terme
of a foolish woman, Iob 2. 10.</p>

bodie should spurne against the head, so is the opposition
and gainesaying of a woman to her husband: as the Moone
applieth it selfe, and turneth to the Sunne, and borroweth
of his light; so should a woman be guided by her head: as
the earth drinketh in the raine, that falleth from heauen; so
should the wife receiue the good counsell of her gouernor.
And as she is compared to a vine, Psalm. 128. 2. so should
she shew her selfe as plyable and tractable, as the vine,
which is apt to be bowed and turned euery way:<note place="margin">

man and wife should be as when two parts are sung in one,
so should they accord, as a melodious harmonie toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
<hi>Tertulliane</hi> speaking of the sweet exercises, which
men and wiues among the Christians vsed together, saith:

by the helpe of a pipe: so should a <hi>woman speake by an others</hi>
(that is her husbands) <hi>tongue, as a piper</hi> by his instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
which is the Apostles precept to women, not to speak
in the congregation, that is in the presence of men.</p>
            <p n="7">7. But though obedience be required in wiues, yet it is
with a double limitation: both for the matter, wherein, and
the manner how this obedience should be performed:<note place="margin">Wherein a wife ought to be obedient.</note> for
first a woman is bound but onely in things lawfull: if any
thing be commanded, either against charity or piety, this
bond holdeth not: <hi>Abigaile</hi> is a president for the one, and
<hi>Michol</hi> for the other: for the one sent releefe vnto <hi>Dauid,</hi>
against churlish <hi>Nabal</hi> her husbands mind, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. and
the other saued her husbands life against her Father the
Kings mind, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 19. 17. And the like case is, if the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
should enioyne his wife any thing against the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of God: for if in the case of wilfull desertion, when the
husband departeth from his wife, shee is no longer bound.
1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 15. Much lesse is shee in subiection, when as the
man manifestly forsaketh God: and so <hi>Hierome</hi> saith well,
<hi>In coniugio constituta non solum conings placere debet, sed ei,
qui indulsit coniugium:</hi>

it must be sociable and amiable. God made woman to bee

            <p n="13">13 For such is the ordinance of God, that man and wife
are counted one flesh, Genes. 2. 24. To diuide then and

so the neare coniunction of the woman with the man,

that <hi>hee was the vaile of her eyes,</hi> Genes. 20. 16.
that shee should not looke vpon any other: so mutually
the husband and wife are each to other, both a vaile to
their eyes, and a couer to their affections, not with the eye

26. Now whereas, as is before obserued, this incuruaton
and bowing of the body was vsed both in religious ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of God, and in the ciuill obseruation of men: as here
this text first historically was verified in <hi>Salomons</hi> Queene,
that shewed reuerence vnto him, so is it spiritually perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in the Church, in adoring of Christ. Hence is it gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that there are two kinds of adoration, one that is ciuill
yeelded to the creature, the other religious onely peculiar
to God the Creator: this distinction is taken out of the
Scripture: for <hi>Peter,</hi> when <hi>Cornelius</hi> fell downe at his feet
and worshipped him: Act. 10. 25. forbad him to doe it:
But when the Shunamite tooke <hi>Elisha</hi> by the feet, falling
downe before him,<note place="margin">Of two kinds of worship re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious and ciuill.</note> 2. King. 4. 27. as <hi>Abigail</hi> did at <hi>Dauids</hi>
feet, 1. Sam. 25. 24. hee did not forbid her so to doe, but
checked his seruant for thrusting her away from his feete:
the reason of this difference is, that the one was a religious
worship, which is not to be accepted, the other ciuill,
which cannot be excepted against, <hi>Gregorie</hi> noteth this
difference well, vpon those words, Genes. 49. 8. <hi>Thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
sonne shall worship thee. Iste sermo paulo durius refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur
ad Iudam, nisi abusiue dicamus, adoratos esse quasi reges
afratrib. This is somewhat harsh, if it be referred to Iuda,
vnlesse wee say,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Homil. 17. in Genes.</note> 
               <hi>that abusiuely, the Kings were adored of
their brethren.</hi> Adoration then is either properly so called,
and it belongeth onely vnto God, or it is so called by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
abuse of the word, and so it may be giuen vnto men.
These two kind of worships are distinguished three waies:
by the conception of the vnderstanding, the intention of
the will, and the disposition of the bodie: so in diuine
worship, first, the iudgement is informed of some diuine
presence,<note place="margin">How the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious and ciuil worship are distinguished.</note> as <hi>Ioshua</hi> was, after he vnderstood who it was that
appeared vnto him, Iosh. 5. 14. then he framed his affection
to an humble kind of reuerence. And lastly his deuotion
shewed it selfe in the outward action, he fell on his face to
the ground. But they are not so well discerned, by the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
gesture of bowing, kneeling, falling downe, and such
like, as by the other two: for these externall actions are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently
vsed in both kinds of worship, sauing that in the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:20718:18"/>

bodie striueth to shew it selfe: as both S. <hi>Peter, Act.</hi> 10. and
the Angell, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 21. knew by the outward preparation
of the body, what <hi>Cornelius</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> intended to doe. This

Church is heere taught to adore Christ in his humanity, as

<hi>I haue prepared you for one husband to present you as a pure

<hi>Hezekiah,</hi> when idolatrie was expelled, and the true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship

            <p n="15">15. So then the true worshippers of God must bee as
virgines, to refuse all other louers, and to keepe them onlie
to God; and the Lord must haue the virginitie and first of
their seruice: he will not take anothers leauings, but will
be the first: euen as the Lord was first serued vnder the law
when they brought vnto him the first fruites of all things:
so God will haue the first oblations of our seruice;<note place="margin">Ambeos. lib. 3. de vergin.</note>

seene in the publique ioy of the people in their triumphs,
at the coronation of Kings, celebrating of marriage feasts
and such like, as <hi>Laban</hi> gathered together all the men of

So the daughters of <hi>Shilo</hi> vsed to come forth in daunces to

procession is, when it is done only for vaine pompe and

as at the dedication of the wall of Ierusalem, <hi>Nehemiah</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided

rich shewes of gold and siluer and pretious stones, causing
the people to bow downe and kneele to a peece of bakers

thinking by them the communion to bee kept vndefiled,
wee by no meanes admit, as preferring a dead matter, and

could be more directly said against the carying of their host
in vessels of gold, vnder canopies of cloth of siluer, with
rich &amp; costly attire, and all to adore a wheaten cake: These
gorgeous shewes they borrow of the heathen Romanes
their predecessors, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> saith: <hi>Hoc ritu habitu et

            <p n="24">24. Now to returne to the historicall sense, heere this
goodly company of virgines doe accompany this glorious
Queene into the Kings pallace: they are attired as virgines,
their behauiour, progresse, walking is, as becommeth vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines.
Heere then such maides as do serue Princes, are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monished
in all their carriage and behauiour to be virgin-like;
<hi>Isay</hi> reprooueth the daughters of <hi>Zion</hi> for three speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all

strange formes of apparell, as their head-tyre, slops,

very fashion and guise of wanton maides and Virgines in
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:20718:30"/>
these times. First, concerning their minsing and affected
gate, see how <hi>Ambrose</hi> checketh the women of his time;
<hi>Cernis vt pomparum ferculis similis incedit,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lib. 1. de virgin.</note>

it were against her will, shee quickly hideth that againe,
which shee wittingly had vncouered, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But how much
more vnseemely is it to vncouer them of purpose, and make
them bare altogether. Now for the third vse, the strange fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion
of womens apparell, in conforming the same to mans
attire: but specially for women in maskes and showes to be
apparelled as men, and men as women, hath alwaies been a
distasteful thing to them, which were more sober minded:
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:20718:31"/>
as <hi>Tertullian</hi> condemneth it directly:<note place="margin">Lib. de idolat.</note> 
               <hi>Nullum cultum a Deo

And lest we might thinke that he speaketh only against or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie
wearing of such apparrell, and not in shewes and
plaies,<note place="margin">Lib. de spectat.</note> he saith in another place thus: <hi>No<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> amat falsum auctor

then alleaging the former place out of <hi>Deutronomie</hi> hee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth
thus: <hi>Quid de pantomimo iudicabit, qui etiam mulie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bribus

occasion lawfull for this changeable vse of men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
garments, which <hi>Ambrose</hi> speaketh of, and it was this:
A certaine virgine of Antioch being condemned to the
stewes, because she would not sacrifice to the idols, prayed
thus vnto God: Lord, which couldest stop the mouthes of
the Lions against <hi>Daniel;</hi> thou also canst bridle the raging
lusts of men:<note place="margin">A virgine put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on a soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers apparrell saued her virginitie.</note> and hauing thus prayed, there came in a soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier,
and changed garments with her, vsing these wordes;
<hi>Quasi adulter ingressus, si vis, martyr egrediar: vestimenta mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temus:
tua vestis me verum militem faciet, mea te virginem,
sume tibi habitum,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lib. 2. de virgin.</note>

I came in as an adulterer, and if thou wilt, will go out
as a martyr; let vs change garments, thy vesture shall make
me a true souldier, mine shall keepe thee a virgine: take
thee an habit, which shall hide thy womanhood, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrate
my martyrdome, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And by this meane the virgin
escaped, and saued her virginitie. The summe is this, that
our virgines and maides of honour, and of all sorts, should
in their solemnities and feastes, be like vnto these virgines,
that is, in their behauiour, apparell, fashion, to carrie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
as it becommeth virgines attending vpon this

So <hi>Heuah,</hi> being so called, because shee was the mother of

            <p n="28">28. There are three vsuall expositions of this place, which
are receiued of the fathers. The first is that of <hi>Ambrose,</hi>
who by the fathers here vnderstandeth the Gentiles:<note place="margin">Lib. 2. in luc. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquit

who by the fathers, vnderstandeth the Patriarkes and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
by these sons the Apostles, which were sent to preach
through the world: he hath other expositions, but hee see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
most to insist vpon this, which <hi>Lyranus</hi> followeth.
The third is <hi>Augustine,</hi>
               <note place="margin">In Psalm. 44.</note> 
               <hi>Pro Apostolis constituti sunt Episcopi;</hi>
who by the fathers vnderstandeth the Apostles, and by the
sonnes Bishops and Pastors: but all these expositions are
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:20718:33"/>
somewhat to streight, in restraining the name of children
onely to pastors and teachers, whereas all the faithfull are
the sonnes of the Church; therefore there is a fourth inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
more agreeable to the Scriptures: that we heere
vnderstand all the faithful people and beleeuers, which spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually
are made Kings and Priests vnto God by Christ,
Reuel. 1. 6. and in this number specially are comprehended
also such Kings and Princes,<note place="margin">How children are borne to the Church in stead of her fathers.</note> which through the world
should professe the faith of Christ, and so <hi>Isay</hi> may inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret
this place, chap. 49. 23. 60. 16. which places are at large
cited before, where expresse mention is made of beleeuing
Kings and Queenes. And lest this exposition might be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused
of noueltie; <hi>Hierome</hi> alloweth of it; for thy fathers

               </note> is not <hi>penes principes seculares sed Episcopos,</hi> is not
in the power of secular Princes, but of Bishops: whom hee
supposeth here to be vnderstood by Princes: 1. I haue shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that this is not the meaning of this Scripture: or if they
will needs haue it meant of spiritual Princes, I say with <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome,
intelligamus Apostolos,</hi> let vs vnderstand the Apostles,
whom Christ sent to preach to the end of the world: but
ordinarie Bishops haue not such a large commission to goe
ouer the world, neither can arrogace to themselues that au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
which the Apostles had. 2. Allow it to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
of Bishops, how are they Princes? <hi>in spiritualibus,</hi> in
spirituall things, as their owne <hi>Lyranus</hi> saith, and as <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi>
well expoundeth, <hi>Thou hast made them Princes,</hi> that is,
<hi>in populis fecisti praeceptores,</hi> thou hast made them teachers
among the people: who denieth, but that it belongeth to
Pastors to giue precepts to the people? that is not to raigne
as Princes in the Church, and so superiour to Kings. 3. And
if <hi>Bellarmine</hi> may haue his saying, then is euery Bishop a
spirituall prince, and absolute in his Diocesse: the Pope
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:20718:33"/>

in diuers other places: yea hee giueth this reason, why hee
putteth his trust in God: <hi>I trusted in thee O Lord, I saide
thou art my God, Psalm.</hi> 31. 14. Therefore our trust must be
onely in God: If then they will make the Virgine <hi>Marie</hi>
our hope, consequently she must be God. And to be a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of mercies, is a title peculiar to God. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 3. They
then in calling the Virgin Mary the mother of mercies,
therein make her equall vnto God. And Christ saith of
himselfe: <hi>I am the way, the truth and the life. Iohn.</hi> 14. 6. In
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:20718:34"/>
making her then our life, they rob Christ of his due: And

of vs as a blessed Saint, yet is not to bee worshipped toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with Christ, but is together with the Saints to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
Christ: her carnall prerogatiue in being the mother of
Christ was not so great, as her spirituall priuiledge of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
in Christ: as hee himselfe saith: when a certaine wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
had cried out vnto him, <hi>blessed is the wombe that bare
thee, and the paps that gaue thee sucke,</hi> hee answered, <hi>yea
rather blessed are they, that heare the word of God, and keepe
it. Luke</hi> 11. 28. So also in another place he saith: <hi>my mother,
and my brethren are those which heere the word of God and doe
it. Luk.</hi> 8. 22. vpon which words <hi>Tertullian</hi> thus obserueth:
<hi>Non matris vterum et vbera negans, sed feliciores designans,

            <p n="31">31. Now in the last place for the application of this text,
both touching the mysticall, as also the historicall sense:
first we see all this heere spoken of by the Prophet, to be
verified in the Church:<note place="margin">In Psal. 44.</note> The Lord hath made the Princes
of the world,<note place="margin">The great mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence of Christian prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces &amp; Nobles toward the Church.</note> the sonnes of the Church: and hath giuen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

thereby the gifts of charity, which the rich a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Gentiles being conuerted should bestow vpon
the Church, this was done, when by the bounty of Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
and other Nobles, Churches, Colleges, Almeshouses
were founded: The like fruits the Gospell hath brought
foorth in <hi>England:</hi> where within the space of fiftie yeares

who hath made his Gospell to abound in such fruits, the

enabled, to shew the like effects and testimonies of their
