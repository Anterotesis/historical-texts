            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Gentlemen,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOU are here presented with the <hi>Life</hi>
and <hi>Reign</hi> of a Prince whose <hi>Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes</hi>
render his Story perhaps as <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable</hi>
as any in our <hi>English An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals.</hi>
Concerning which I shall only assure you,
that the <hi>Compiler</hi> (for he as little <hi>affects,</hi>
as deserves the <hi>Title</hi> of an <hi>Author)</hi> has made
it his Business truly to set down naked <hi>Matters
of Fact</hi> as he finds them Related by the <hi>best
Authors,</hi> without obtruding his own <hi>Fancies</hi>
or <hi>Dreams</hi> under the Notion of <hi>History.</hi>
Which that it may more evidently appear, he
thinks fit to give you an Account of <hi>Two</hi> of the
<hi>Authors</hi> whom he hath principally followed;
Because <hi>One</hi> of them living in <hi>that very time,</hi>
and the <hi>other</hi> either then, or not long after,
they may rationally be supposed to have the
most <hi>certain knowledge</hi> of those <hi>Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first is <hi>Henricus Knighton,</hi> whose
Work <hi>De Eventibus Angliae,</hi> in <hi>Latin,</hi> is
Printed amongst divers other ancient <hi>Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>
in that large and accurate <hi>Collection,</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled,
<pb facs="tcp:99794:3"/>
               <hi>Historiae Anglicanae Scriptores De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem:</hi>
First brought into Publick Light from
<hi>Authentick Manuscripts,</hi> by those two learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Antiquaries,</hi> Sir <hi>Roger Twysden</hi> Knight
and Baronet, and the Famous <hi>John Selden</hi>
Esquire, (who both prefixt their <hi>Epistles</hi>
thereunto.) Nor was that <hi>Miraculous Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury
of all solid Learning,</hi> the most Reverend
<hi>Usher</hi> Primate of <hi>Armaugh,</hi> wanting in
Advising and Promoting that <hi>Edition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Great <hi>Selden</hi> in his <hi>Preface, Fol.</hi> 46.
tells us, That this <hi>Knighton</hi> was a <hi>Canon</hi>
of the Abbey of <hi>Leicester,</hi> and that he <hi>flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risht</hi>
in the time of this King <hi>Richard</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
the most part of whose Reign he wrote, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
his <hi>History</hi> from <hi>William</hi> the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour,</hi>
until within Four years before the
<hi>Deposition</hi> of the said King <hi>Richard, viz.</hi>
To the year 1395. At which time we may sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
that <hi>Author</hi> was himself snatcht away by
Death, or disabled by some <hi>Disease,</hi> for else
he would not so abruptly have discontinued his
<hi>Book.</hi> Which Conjecture is confirmed by what
Sir <hi>Roger Twysden</hi> in his <hi>Epistle</hi> tells us,
That in the <hi>Manuscript</hi> in the Renowned
<hi>Cotton</hi>'s <hi>Library,</hi> (which he conceives to be
the very <hi>Autographon,</hi> or Original Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing
of the <hi>Author,</hi> and from which the
same was exactly Printed) there is in the
<hi>first Page</hi> an <hi>Inscription,</hi> Intituled, <hi>Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
<pb facs="tcp:99794:3"/>
Compilatoris, <hi>The Compilers Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint,</hi>
               </hi>
beginning thus;
<q>
                  <l>Sum Caecus factus subitâ Caligine tactus.</l>
                  <l>Blind I am grown, with sudden darkness
struck.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And thus concluding:</p>
            <q>
               <l>Me Deus allisit, cum vult sanare, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebit.</l>
               <l>In Domino semper stat quod relevabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur
Aeger.</l>
               <l>Smitten I am by God, who when he please</l>
               <l>Can help me, and alone cure each Disease.</l>
               <l>—And so much for <hi>Knighton.</hi>
               </l>
            </q>
            <p>The other is <hi>Thomas Walsingham,</hi> a
<hi>Benedictine Monk</hi> belonging to the <hi>Abbey</hi>
of S. <hi>Albans;</hi> who for ought appears might
likewise live in King <hi>Richard</hi>'s days, for he
is said to have <hi>flourisht,</hi> that is, to be grown
famous by his Labours, about the year 1440.
And <hi>Leland</hi> gives this Character of him,
<hi>In Historiis Colligendis studiosus atque di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligens,</hi>

His History (herein made use of) begins,
<hi>An. Dom.</hi> 1273, and ends <hi>Anno</hi> 1432.</p>

            <head>THE
Life and Reign
OF
KING RICHARD
The Second.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">K</seg>Ing <hi>Richard</hi> the Second was born at
<hi>Burdeaux</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> in the Year
1366. His Father was that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned
Hero <hi>Edward,</hi> commonly
called <hi>The Black Prince,</hi> eldest
Son of the Great and Victorious
King, <hi>Edward the Third,</hi> His Mother <hi>Joan</hi> Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the Earl of <hi>Kent,</hi> for her exquisite Beauty,
styled, <hi>The fair Maid of Kent.</hi> And if he were so
unhappy, as not altogether to Inherit his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers
<hi>Prudence,</hi> and his Fathers <hi>Spirit and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,</hi>
yet it cannot be denied but he retained some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of his Mothers <hi>Handsomness,</hi> being celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for the <hi>goodliest Personage,</hi> and most <hi>amiable
Countenance</hi> of any King that had been before him
since the Conquest.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:99794:6"/>
His Father, after he had filled both <hi>France</hi> and
<hi>Spain</hi> with terrible Trophies of his <hi>Valour,</hi> (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
taken the King of the <hi>former Prisoner,</hi> and
in the <hi>latter</hi> generously by his Arms restored <hi>Peter</hi>
King of <hi>Castile</hi> and <hi>Leon,</hi> when injuriously dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
out of those <hi>Realms</hi> by the <hi>Arragonians</hi> and
<hi>French)</hi> was in the Forty sixth year of his Age,
snatcht away by death (some say hastened by <hi>Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son)</hi>
during the Life of his Father King <hi>Edward;</hi>
who having then <hi>three other Sons</hi> still surviving,
<hi>viz. John</hi> of <hi>Gaunt</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaster; Edmund</hi> of
<hi>Langley</hi> afterwards Earl of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and Duke of
<hi>York;</hi> and <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Woodstock,</hi> afterwards Duke
of <hi>Gloucester:</hi> For preventing any Quarrels after
his own decease, and all <hi>Pretensions</hi> which any of
them might make to the Crown, to the prejudice
of his Grandchild, (this our Prince <hi>Richard,</hi> to
whom as Son of the eldest Brother it was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged
to belong:) He resolves to see his Right
declared and settled in <hi>Parliament;</hi> Creating
likewise the said <hi>Richard</hi> first Earl of <hi>Chester</hi> and
<hi>Cornwall,</hi> and then <hi>Prince of Wales;</hi> and taking an
<hi>Oath</hi> of all the <hi>Lords</hi> of the <hi>Realm</hi> to accept him
for their <hi>King</hi> as his lawful <hi>Heir,</hi> when ever him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
should expire.</p>
            <p>Being thus put into the immediate Prospect of
a <hi>Crown,</hi> the <hi>over-burdensom Glory</hi> came <hi>too fast<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his <hi>tender head,</hi> for <hi>King Edward</hi> having over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liv'd
his <hi>Fortune,</hi> and the better part of himself,
his Conquests abroad being daily ravisht back, and
<hi>Alice Price</hi> his Concubine shamefully ruling both
Him and most Affairs at home, oppressed with
<hi>Grief</hi> and <hi>Age,</hi> (though some say much more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitated
by the Caresses of that <hi>petulant Strumpet)</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:99794:6"/>
resign'd his last Breath at <hi>Richmond,</hi> the One and
twentieth of <hi>June, Anno Dom.</hi> 1377, in the Sixty
fourth Year of his Age, having Reigned Fifty
Years, four Months, and odd Days.</p>
            <p>Upon the first notice of his Death, the City of
<hi>London</hi> sent <hi>Deputies</hi> to Prince <hi>Richard,</hi> (who
with the Princess his Mother lay then at <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone)</hi>
to acknowledge him their lawfull Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign,
and request that he would please to honour
them with his Presence and nearer Residence:
Which Message was kindly received, and the
<hi>young King</hi> soon after came to his Palace at <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster,</hi>
and on the Sixteenth day of <hi>July</hi> was so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
Crowned; the Citizens sparing no Cost to
express their <hi>Loyalty</hi> and <hi>zealous Affection</hi> to his
Person, both in his Passage through the Town, and
at his Coronation; As by several <hi>Triumphant Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi>
Conduits running with <hi>Wine,</hi> and all other
Demonstrations of a transporting Joy; Insomuch
that by some of the <hi>Nobility</hi> he was Ironically cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>The Londoner's King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His tender Age (being at his Grandfathers
Death but eleven years old) required some <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector,</hi>
or <hi>chief Managers</hi> of <hi>Publick Affairs,</hi> but
to whom to commit so weighty a <hi>Trust,</hi> is the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty:
If to <hi>One, Ambition</hi> joyned with <hi>Power,</hi>
may tempt to <hi>Vsurpation;</hi> Nor wanted they a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
at home, whilst they remembred how King
<hi>John</hi> justled out his Nephew <hi>Prince Arthur.</hi> If
to <hi>several,</hi> then it might be feared, that diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
private Interests, Factions, and By-ends,
(from which scarce any of the <hi>Grandees</hi> were
free) might intangle or retard their Proceedings,
so as to obstruct their acting unanimously and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:99794:7"/>
chearfully for the Publick Weal: At last hoping
to please all Pretenders, and considering that from
a multitude of Councellors most safety might be
expected; They intrusted first the Kings <hi>Three
Vncles;</hi> but <hi>Lancaster,</hi> whether discontented to
have any <hi>Partners,</hi> or that he cared not much to
intermeddle, because he had contracted both the
Enmity of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> and the dissatisfaction of the
<hi>Londoners:</hi> Or whether having a pretence to
the Crown of <hi>Castile,</hi> by the Marriage of <hi>Constance</hi>
Daughter of the before-mentioned King <hi>Peter,</hi>
that he might better pursue his Claim thereunto,
warily withdrawing himself from that Charge; se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
other Lords both <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Temporal</hi>
were added, till at last being found <hi>too many,</hi> the
same was Conferr'd wholly upon the Earl of <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi>
who discharged the Office with good sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Scotch</hi> and <hi>French</hi> promising themselves
Advantages from the Kings Minority, began to
make Attempts upon his Territories, almost be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he was in possession of the Crown. The <hi>first</hi>
surprized the Castle of <hi>Berwick,</hi> the <hi>second</hi> the
<hi>Isle of Wight,</hi> and burnt and pillag'd several Towns
and Villages on the Coasts, but were both quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
repuls'd and beaten out again.</p>
            <p>About two Months after the Coronation, a
Parliament is called, which sate from <hi>Michaelmas</hi>
to S. <hi>Andrew</hi>'s Day, and Banished <hi>Alice Price,</hi>
King <hi>Edward</hi>'s <hi>Mistress;</hi> for that whereas for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
being complained of as a <hi>Grievance</hi> in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
she had sworn never to come again into
the Kings <hi>Court</hi> or <hi>Presence,</hi> (which the King
had likewise confirmed with his Oath) yet after
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:99794:7"/>
the death of the <hi>Black Prince,</hi> she had returned
and misgovern'd the King, presuming to fit in
judicial Courts, and by her Presence and Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to wrest <hi>Justice,</hi> and in his sickness flattered
him with hopes of Life, so that he neglected ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Provision for his Soul, till he was quite <hi>speech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,</hi>
whilst she in the mean time purloyned away
the choicest things in the Palace, and stole even
the very <hi>Rings</hi> off his Fingers, and then (like a
<hi>Right Harlot)</hi> left him gasping for Life, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to speak one word, in the Company only of
one poor Priest. My Author says, when she
came now to be questioned, she had with <hi>Money</hi>
corrupted many of the <hi>Lords,</hi> and <hi>all the Lawyers
of England,</hi> who did not only secretly but pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
plead and use all their Interest in her behalf;
yet she was so vigorously prosecuted by the
Knights in Parliament, that being by her own
Mouth Convicted, she was <hi>Banisht</hi> the Land, and
all her Estate moveable and immoveable, forfeited
to the <hi>Exchequer;</hi> from whence by the late Kings
Favour, or rather <hi>Dotage,</hi> it had unduly been
obtain'd.</p>
            <p>There was also by this Parliament given to the
King <hi>Two Tenths</hi> of the Clergy, and <hi>Two Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenths</hi>
of the <hi>Temporalty,</hi> to be paid the same
year; but on this Condition, <hi>viz.</hi> That the King
for the future should not burden them with more
Requests of that kind, to draw away his Subjects
Money, but would live on his <hi>Demeasns,</hi> and
continue his War; for that (as it was there an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd)
His proper <hi>Royal Revenues</hi> were <hi>sufficient</hi>
both to maintain his <hi>Court,</hi> and carry on his
<hi>Wars,</hi> if the same were but manag'd by <hi>fit</hi> and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:99794:8"/>
               <hi>trusty Ministers:</hi> And therefore it was agreed,
that this Money so given, should as it was raised,
be deposited in the hands of <hi>two Citizens</hi> of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
William Waller,</hi> and <hi>John Philpot,</hi> who were
to see it bestow'd for the Defence of the Realm.</p>
            <p>[1378.] This <hi>John Philpot</hi> was an <hi>Alderman</hi> of
<hi>London,</hi> a Person of no less <hi>Courage</hi> than <hi>Prudence,</hi>
as appears by the following Exploit: Sometime
after the <hi>Parliament</hi> broke up, and the Money
collected; the Duke of <hi>Lancaster</hi> (to whom no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
almost could be denied) was very Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
to have the same delivered to his Dispose,
promising therewith to free the Nation from all
<hi>Invasions</hi> and <hi>Pyracies,</hi> wherewith it was lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
infested, and to perform other very advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous
Services for the Publick: Whereupon he
obtained an Order for the same, notwithstanding
the <hi>Proviso</hi> in the Act, so impossible it is <hi>de facto</hi>
to bind up the Hands of <hi>Power:</hi> But though some
<hi>Naval Preparations</hi> were made, yet little was ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
to repel or prevent those Injuries and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>predations,
which the Nation suffered by Sea from
the <hi>French</hi> on the one side, and the <hi>Scottish Picka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roons</hi>
on the other; so that by the common neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
of securing the Coasts, and scowring the Seas,
our <hi>Merchants</hi> durst not Traffick abroad for fear
of <hi>Pyrates,</hi> who hovered in every Corner, but
especially of one <hi>Mercer,</hi> a bold and potent <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish
Rover,</hi> who having drawn together a consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Fleet of <hi>French, Scots</hi> and <hi>Spaniards,</hi> daily
committed insufferable Outrages, spoiling all they
met: Hereupon the said <hi>Alderman Philpot</hi> first
complained of these <hi>Grievances</hi> to the <hi>Kings Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,</hi>
humbly Remonstrating the Damages sustained,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:99794:8"/>
and imploring <hi>Redress;</hi> But receiving from them
only fair <hi>Promises,</hi> and no <hi>Relief,</hi> full of <hi>grief</hi> and
<hi>disdain,</hi> to see his Country-men thus devoured by
those insolent <hi>Water-vermin;</hi> He at length Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided,
Victualled, and Man'd forth at his <hi>own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Costs and Charges,</hi> a competent Fleet of tall
Ships, himself in <hi>person,</hi> putting forth with them
to Sea, where he soon encountred the Pyrates,
<hi>took</hi> the said <hi>Mercer,</hi> destroyed his Ships, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
most of the Prizes formerly taken, with
Fifteen <hi>Spanish Bottoms</hi> well fraught with Riches,
besides many <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Scottish</hi> Ships, and so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
with <hi>Triumph</hi> and the general <hi>Acclamations</hi>
of the People: But <hi>Envy</hi> is always the Attendant
of extraordinary <hi>Vertue,</hi> instead of Thanks or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
several of the <hi>Nobles</hi> from whom he seemed
to have snatcht by this his fortunate Attempt, the
Glory of that Service, which their Country justly,
though in vain expected from them, passed harsh
Censures on his forwardness; and particularly
the Earl of <hi>Stafford</hi> called him in question at the
<hi>Council-Table,</hi> for presuming (being but a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
man) for to levy Arms, and equip a Fleet
without Authority: But <hi>Philpot</hi> with a <hi>prudent
Gallantry,</hi> composed of an undaunted Innocency,
and an humble Merit, gave such a justifiable Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the Act, as satisfied the <hi>Board,</hi> or at least
silenc'd his Accusers: For thus in particular to that
Lord, he is said to have answered, <hi>I would have
your Honour undoubtedly know, that I did not adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
my Money, my Person, and my Men to the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
of the Sea, and hazards of War, with any
design to Rob your Lordship, and your Collegues, of the
Glory of Chivalry, or Fame of Military Atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:99794:9"/>
and gain it to my self. But condoling the losses
of my fellow Citizens, and misery of my Country
which by your sloth from a most noble Kingdom, giving
Laws to all her Neighbours, is sunk into so deplored a
state as to ly open to the Insolencies and Pillagings of
the vilest of Nations and men, whilst yet not one of you
lent a hand her defence, I freely exposed my self
and mine for her deliverance, and the publick safety,</hi>
to which the Earl had nothing to reply.</p>
            <p>About the same time, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Second Year
of the King, there happened a Fray which (not so
much for the importance of the Quarrel, as a <hi>rare
Example</hi> of Fidelity and honesty attending it)
I cannot but Relate; Though even the thing it self
in those ignorantly zealous times, wanted not its
ill Influence on the <hi>Publick,</hi> and the <hi>Monkish Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi>
cry out about it as Tragically, as if Heaven
and Earth were ingag'd, all Christianity at Stake,
and the Pillars of Religion in danger. The busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
thus; Two valiant Squires, <hi>Robert Haule,</hi> and
<hi>John Schakel,</hi> in the late Wars in <hi>Spain</hi> under
Prince <hi>Edward,</hi> chanc'd to take the <hi>Count de Dena,</hi>
a <hi>Spanish Don</hi> of great Quality and Estate, who
was fairly by the Law of Arms adjudg'd their
Prisoner, and brought into <hi>England,</hi> where
he left his Eldest Son with them as a Pledge,
whilst he went home to raise his ransome, the
Son swearing to continue with them till it came;
but the Father being got into <hi>Spain,</hi> never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
to send the Money, but in little time
<hi>dies,</hi> whereby the Honour and Estate devol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves
to the <hi>Young Hostage;</hi> which being under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
by King <hi>Edward,</hi> (for in his days hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
this first part of the Story) both he and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:99794:9"/>
Prince <hi>Edward</hi>'s Son, were very importunate with
these two Gentlemen, to release the <hi>Spanish Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leir,</hi>
which they desired either in favour to the
Duke of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> who thought by the help of
this Nobleman to faciliate his pretentions to the
Crown of <hi>Castile,</hi> or else with an intent to Match
him to <hi>Mathilda</hi> Relict of the Lord <hi>Courtney,</hi> the
Kings Sister; but no matter what their Design was,
the Squires were so far from parting with him, that
they would not discover where he was, and so were
sent to the <hi>Tower,</hi> whence making their escape
they took <hi>Sanctuary</hi> in <hi>Westminster Abbey,</hi> and
there continued, till now the Duke of <hi>Lancaster</hi>
resolved to ferret them out, to which purpose Fifty
men at Arms were sent thither, who entring the
<hi>Sanctuary,</hi> put a trick upon <hi>John Schakel,</hi> and soon
got him out and hurried him to the <hi>Tower;</hi> but as
for <hi>Haule,</hi> he was more strongly <hi>Ensconc'd</hi> in the
Church amongst the <hi>Monks,</hi> and at <hi>Mass,</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
thither they went, and after a little expostu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
why he would so refractorily disobey the
Kings Command, when even Majesty had conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended
to a request? they tell him, he must go with
them, which he peremtorily refuses, and draws a
short Sword and makes at them; whereupon they
resolve to force him away, who still making resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
was at last knockt on the Head amongst them
which our Author calls <hi>Crown'd with Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:</hi>
the <hi>Monks</hi> would fain have rescued him, but
drust not, because they saw the Souldiers <hi>too strong</hi>
for them, however the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi>
presently thundred out an <hi>Excommunication</hi> against
these Violaters of the <hi>Sanctuary</hi> and all their abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
the King and his Mother, and his Uncle
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:99794:10"/>
               <hi>Lancaster</hi> only excepted; And the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
did the like for several days together, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
a Year after by the mediation of divers grave
and venerable Persons, the matter was composed
on these terms; that the said <hi>Schakel,</hi> who was so
sent to the <hi>Tower,</hi> should discover and deliver up
the said <hi>Count de Dena,</hi> aud so be set at liberty,
upon consideration, that the King should settle up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him Lands, to the value of an <hi>Hundred Marks
per annum,</hi> and pay him down Five hundred <hi>Marks</hi>
ready Money, in lieu of the expected <hi>Ransom,</hi> and
also that his Majesty for satisfaction to the Church,
should at his proper Charges erect a <hi>Chauntry</hi> of
<hi>Five Priests</hi> for ever, to <hi>pray for the Soul</hi> of him
whom his Officers had so slain, though one would
have thought dying, in their Opinion, a Martyr,
he might have had no great <hi>need</hi> of such everlasting
<hi>Orisons.</hi> But still the more surprizing Intrigue of
the <hi>Tragedy</hi> is behind, when <hi>Schakel</hi> came to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
his Captive, he shew'd them <hi>his man</hi> that wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
on him; for the brave <hi>Spaniard</hi> had that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to his Word which he had passed, that he
scorn'd to discover himself without his leave, but
on the contrary had all along both in the <hi>Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary,</hi>
and in the <hi>Tower,</hi> faithfully and submissively
serv'd him in disguise, neglecting both his <hi>Quality</hi>
and <hi>Interest,</hi> when they stood in competition with
his <hi>Honour;</hi> a piece of <hi>Gallantry</hi> and <hi>generous Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty,</hi>
scarce to be parallel'd in Story.</p>
            <p>About the Feast of S. <hi>Luke,</hi> a <hi>Parliament</hi> was
held at <hi>Glocester,</hi> with an intent as was thought to
have alipp'd the Wings of the <hi>Towering Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi>
but finding their Interest too strong, nothing of
that kind was offered, but for the <hi>Kings</hi> further
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:99794:10"/>
supply, it was granted, that he should have of the
Merchants for every Sack of <hi>Wool</hi> Exported, a
<hi>Mark,</hi> and for every Twenty shillings of Wares or
Merchandizes whatsoever Imported from beyound
the Seas, <hi>Six pence,</hi> to be paid by the <hi>Buyer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>[1379.] The next year another <hi>Parliament</hi> was
called at <hi>London,</hi> where the Priviledges of the <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary</hi>
at <hi>Westminster</hi> were regulated; for whereas
before great numbers of Persons when they were
got in <hi>Debt,</hi> would shelter themselves, and waste in
Revelling and Debauchery their Revenues, which
could not be touched for their <hi>just Debts,</hi> to the
grievous prejudice of their Creditors; it was now
Ordained, That if upon Proclamation made, they
should not surrender themselves, them their <hi>Goods</hi>
should be sold and their <hi>Lands</hi> extended, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
found, till their <hi>Debts</hi> satisfied. There was
also a new <hi>Tax</hi> granted, but because the Commons
were already much impoverisht, it was laid only
on the Nobility, Gentry, and Clergy, by way of
<hi>Poll;</hi> Viz. <hi>Dukes</hi> and <hi>Archbishops,</hi> Ten Marks a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece;
every <hi>Earl, Bishop,</hi> and <hi>Mitred Abbot,</hi> Six
Marks, besides each <hi>Abbot</hi> to pay Forty Pence <hi>per</hi>
Head for all his <hi>Monks;</hi> and so <hi>Justices, Sheriffs,
Knights, Esquires, Rectors, Vicars,</hi> and even down
to simple <hi>Chaplains,</hi> every one his <hi>Allotment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Summer there was a most <hi>dreadful Pestilence</hi>
in <hi>England,</hi> especially in the <hi>Northern parts,</hi> inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that whole Families were swept away. Nay
Towns and Villages left without Inhabitants: Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Heat of which Calamity, the <hi>Scots</hi> took
their Advantage to enter the <hi>Land,</hi> and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
great Spoils in small Parties, but durst not stay
for fear of the Infection, and yet (as our Author
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:99794:11"/>
relates) they had got a wonderful <hi>Preservative</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it: for asking some <hi>English,</hi> the reason of so
great a Mortality amongst them, and being told it
came by <hi>the Grace of God,</hi> they therefore every
Morning with great solemnity used this <hi>Charm,</hi> or
(if any body will call it so) Prayer—<hi>God</hi> and <hi>Saint
Mango, Saint Roman,</hi> and <hi>Saint Andrew, shield
us this day</hi> from <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Grace, and the foul Death
that English men die upon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>[1380.] The next Year in <hi>Jan.</hi> the <hi>Parliament</hi>
was again Assembled at <hi>London,</hi> and continued till
<hi>March,</hi> wherein to avoid unnecessary Charge it
was agreed, that the <hi>Tutelage</hi> of the King, should
be committed but to one, and by unanimous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
<hi>Thomas Beuchamp,</hi> Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> was pitch'd
upon for the Man, an Honourable allowance being
assign'd to him out of the Royal <hi>Exchequer</hi> for his
pains and care therein to be taken; but the Young
King though a <hi>Minor</hi> as to the Publick Affairs,
thought himself of Age sufficient at least to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
himself in his private and personal concerns;
for though for want of ripening experience; his
Wisdom had not time to Bud, yet his <hi>Will</hi> was
grown to full <hi>Strength:</hi> being already Plunged in
the Gulf of pleasure, and Vanities of Youth, he
set himself to Promote such as most pleased him
with <hi>Flatteries,</hi> rather than such as were truly
qualified to serve him with solid Council and able
conduct; whence arose Three <hi>fatal mischiefs:</hi> for
First, his Affairs were indiscreetly managed, and
without success, by reason unfit Ministers were
imploy'd about them, Secondly, debauchery was
increased, First, in the <hi>Court,</hi> and next throughout
the Kingdom; for many of the <hi>Young Nobility,</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:99794:11"/>
observing the secret <hi>favours</hi> and <hi>distastes</hi> of the
King, studying in all things to gratifie his pleasure,
gave up themselves to dissolute and <hi>dishonourable</hi>
courses; which <hi>ill precedents</hi> descended like an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
amongst the Gentry and Commonalty; for
<hi>Vice</hi> always finds too many followers, even when
it hath no incouragers, but much more doth it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease,
when flusht with <hi>Great Examples,</hi> and made
the <hi>Scale</hi> or perferment. And lastly the King by
thus misplaceing his favours impaired the <hi>Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
due to Majesty, became <hi>Cheap</hi> in the Eyes of his
Subjects, and less respected, for it is almost as dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
to a Prince to have evil and <hi>despised Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites</hi>
and Adherents, as to be evil or despicable him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
In this Parliament was granted a Tenth from
the <hi>Clergy</hi> and a Fifteenth from the <hi>Laiety,</hi> but on
condition, that from thence, which was <hi>March
1380.</hi> to <hi>Michaelmas</hi> 1381. there should be no
more Parliaments; that is, no more Money rais'd.</p>
            <p>This Summer the King and Council sent a strong
<hi>Army</hi> to assist the Duke of <hi>Bretaigne,</hi> under the
Command of his Unckle <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Woodstock,</hi>
Sir <hi>Thomas Peircy,</hi> &amp;c. who landing at <hi>Calice,</hi> forced
their passage through the Body of <hi>France,</hi> leading
their <hi>Troops</hi> to and fro, and laying the Countrey
waste at their pleasure, without any resistance, till
they came to the Borders of <hi>Bretaign,</hi> where they
were joyfully received, but the very <hi>Terror</hi> of their
March, had disposed the <hi>French</hi> to an accomodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
so that they made peace with the Duke of
<hi>Bretaign,</hi> whereupon our Army without any
other advantages, but those of <hi>Renown</hi> and Glory
returned home.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding it was agreed in the last Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:99794:12"/>
to the contrary, yet by the too great preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of some Counsellors, a <hi>Parliament</hi> against
the will and consent of almost all the <hi>Great Men</hi> of
the Land, was this same Year about the Feast of
S. <hi>Martin,</hi> (which is <hi>Novemb.</hi> 10th) Conven'd at
<hi>Northampton,</hi> a place most unfit for such an <hi>Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,</hi>
as well for that it was <hi>Winter,</hi> and scarce any
Fewel for <hi>Firing</hi> there to be procured; as also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it afforded not <hi>Lodgings</hi> enow to entertain
those that should have resorted thither: but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
so much the <hi>more fit</hi> for the design of the <hi>small
Politicians;</hi> for here they got past a very <hi>severe
Tax,</hi> or <hi>Poll bill.</hi> Whereby every <hi>Priest, Secular</hi>
or <hi>Religious,</hi> was to pay a <hi>Noble,</hi> and every <hi>Nun</hi> as
much, and every Man and Woman, Married or
unmarried, being of the age of Sixteen years,
<hi>Twelve Pence,</hi> (Beggars onely excepted) the
paying whereof was esteem'd very grievous by the
People, especially of the poorer sort. And that
which aggravated their misery, was, that when it
came into the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> it was so handled by those
imploied about it, that it amounted not to so much
as some former <hi>Taxes,</hi> which were given in less
proportion: whereupon some of the <hi>Kings Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters</hi>
complained that it had not been duly Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted;
and one <hi>John Legg,</hi> and three of his Asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates,
obtained a Commission to inspect and review
the Levy, bargaining to give the <hi>King</hi> a great
Sum of Money for the same: But indeed on that
pretence committing horrible <hi>Oppressions, Exacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
and <hi>Insolencies</hi> in divers parts, especially in
<hi>Kent, Norfolk,</hi> and the adjacent Counties.</p>
            <p>Hence immediately after, <hi>viz.</hi> In the Spring of
the Year 1381, arose one of the most formidable
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:99794:12"/>
and mischievous <hi>Insurrections</hi> that had been heard
of almost in any Age; the old <hi>Bellum servile</hi> of
the <hi>Romans</hi> was acted in <hi>England,</hi> but with greater
Impudence and mischief; the <hi>Slaves</hi> are in Arms,
and the very <hi>Dregs</hi> of the people will be Lords
and Masters. The true <hi>Causes</hi> or <hi>Occasions</hi> of this
unexpected Confusion are very differently related,
some <hi>Monkish Historians</hi> (followed, blindfold by
some later Authors) out of hatred to <hi>Wickliffe</hi>
and his <hi>Tenets,</hi> (which now began to be much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seminated,
and of which we shall by and by give a
further account) attributed it chiefly to his <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine:</hi>
for 'tis an ordinary thing to proclaim all
Evils, concurring with any Attempts of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in Religion, to be proper <hi>fruits</hi> thereof; as
the <hi>Heathens</hi> of old imputed all their Calamities
to the then new and rising Sect of the <hi>Christians:</hi>
But as we find nothing in that good mans real Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
(for several of his <hi>Works</hi> are yet extant)
to foment such a lewd Rebellion; so neither do
the more impartial Authors of that Age lay it
at his Door: though 'tis agreed, one <hi>Ball</hi> a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious
Clergy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>man was an Incendiary of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bustion,
which seems in its Original ascribable
to the natural desire of <hi>Liberty,</hi> and pride of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Nature, impatient of Superiority, since the
<hi>Villains</hi> or <hi>Bondmen</hi> were chief in the Tumult;
and partly to the heavy <hi>Taxes</hi> and <hi>Insolencies</hi> of
the Collectors, and especially of these New Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
of the Subsidy, or Commissioners, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asperated
the common people into a Mutiny. But
whatever were the <hi>Provocations,</hi> dismal were the
<hi>Effects,</hi> and might have prov'd fatal to the utter
ruine of the Kingdom, had not the Providence of
God wonderfully prevented it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:99794:13"/>
Nor is it less disputable where the Uproar be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,
some say in <hi>Essex,</hi> some in <hi>Kent;</hi> for the
<hi>Flame</hi> w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s so suddenly spread into divers places,
that they could scarce tell where the <hi>Fire</hi> broke
forth, and who first headed them, is also uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain;
some speak of one <hi>Thomas</hi> a Baker of <hi>Fob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hyngges;</hi>
others of <hi>Walter Tyler</hi> at <hi>Deptford</hi> in
<hi>Kent,</hi> to be the Ringleader: but the most recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Tradition is thus. That one of the said Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectors
of Poll-money, coming to the house of the
said <hi>Tyler</hi> (so called from his Trade) and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of his Wife to pay for a Daughter of hers,
whom she affirmed was not of age to pay, the rude
Fellow told her, he would presently see whether
she were so or not, and forceably turn'd up her
Coats, whereupon the Mother made such an
Out-cry, that her Husband being at work hard
by, heard her, and came running with his <hi>Lathing
Staff</hi> in his hand, wherewith he beat out the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectors
Brains, and knowing that for the same he
must be hang'd, endeavoured to secure himself by
greater Crimes, drawing together the Rabble,
and incensing them, (who of themselves were
but too ready) unto a <hi>Rebellion:</hi> Thus Multitudes
flockt together, broke open the Goal at <hi>Maidstone,</hi>
where the before-mentioned <hi>Ball</hi> the Priest was
then a Prisoner, who having gain'd his Liberty,
marched along with them; and they growing still
more numerous, (some write an Hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
strong) came to <hi>Blackheath,</hi> where he made
a seditious Preachment to them, taking for his
Text or Theme the old Proverb;
<q>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:99794:13"/>
                  <l>When Adam Delv'd, and Eve Span,</l>
                  <l>Who was then a Gentleman?</l>
               </q>
From thence telling them, <q>That by Descent
from <hi>Adam,</hi> all men were of one Condition;
That the <hi>Laws</hi> of the <hi>Realm</hi> were injurious to
<hi>Christian Liberty,</hi> and unjust by making such
difference of mens Estates, preferring some to
be <hi>Peers</hi> and <hi>Potentates,</hi> with great <hi>Authority</hi>
and large <hi>Possessions,</hi> whereby they took advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of the humble plyable Condition of others,
to keep them in slavery, hardly affording them
Sustenance; whereas there ought to be an equal
sharing of all things, and that in common, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Doctrine</hi> was extreamly pleasing to these
<hi>Raggamuffins,</hi> who animated thus with Multitudes,
and holding Correspondence with others as mad as
themselves in other Counties, they Arrested all
<hi>Strangers</hi> that they met with, making them swear
<hi>to be true to King</hi> Richard, <hi>and to the Commons, and
never to own any King that should be called</hi> John:
which they did out of spight to the Duke of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caster,</hi>
against whom they had an implacable Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice.
They likewise beheaded all <hi>Lawyers</hi> they
could catch, saying, Till they were rooted out,
the Land would never enjoy free liberty.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Black-heath</hi> they sent for the King to hear
their Grievances, but the <hi>Archbishop</hi> of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>
and the <hi>Lord Treasurer,</hi> disswaded him from
venturing his <hi>Royal Person</hi> amongst them, which
being understood by the <hi>Commons,</hi> they were
thereupon more enraged against those two, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
them <hi>Traytors;</hi> and to be revenged imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:99794:14"/>
march towards <hi>London;</hi> in <hi>Southwark</hi> they
discharge all Prisoners, and when the <hi>Mayor</hi> of
<hi>London</hi> would have pull'd up the Draw-bridge,
and shut the Gates against them, the Rabble of
the City would not suffer him, so that all that
Night they came in and out at their pleasure, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the more favoured, because hitherto they
spoiled no man, but honestly paid for all they had,
saying, They came not as Robbers, but to bring
Malefactors to justice. The <hi>King</hi> to prevent
Mischief, sent them word to meet Him at <hi>Mile-end,</hi>
where he would hear their Complaints, and
part of them accordingly went thither, where the
King gave them a <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

they forthwith Beheaded, carrying their Heads

with both Wine and Blood, they march to the

Palace, (the best House in <hi>England)</hi> with all its
<hi>rich Furniture</hi> to Ashes, breaking in pieces all his

Plate and Jewels of inestimable value, and flinging
them into the <hi>Thames,</hi> and when one of their
Fellows was spy'd to thrust a piece of Plate into his

<hi>fire</hi> to be destroy'd together<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> saying, They came not
like <hi>Thieves</hi> to enrich themselves. But of Liquors
they were not so scrupulous; for two and thirty

Tippled so long till the Rafters of the House on
fire, fell down, and stopt the passage, that they
could not get out, but were heard to cry seven
days after, and so perished. From the <hi>Savoy</hi> they
came back to the <hi>Temple,</hi> and burnt the <hi>Lawyers</hi>
Lodgings, Books, Papers, and all Records they
could meet with: The house of S. <hi>John</hi>'s by <hi>Smith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,</hi>
they set fire to, so that it burnt seven days;
Nor had they any regard to <hi>Churches<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> but forc'd
out such as fled thither for Sanctuary, and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed
them, for they used no other manner of
Execution to high or low.</p>
            <p>That Night wearied with spoil, and generally
Drunk, they lay sleeping like Swine in the open
Streets and under the <hi>Walls:</hi> and the next day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
routed together again, the King with a small
Guard coming to <hi>Smithfield,</hi> offered a Pardon to all
such as yet after all these Outrages would cease
from the like for the future, and go quickly home.
Whereupon <hi>Wat Tyler</hi> declared, That he was for
Peace very willingly, provided it were on such
Terms as he should approve of: Therefore to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
what he would have, one Sir <hi>John Newton</hi> is
sent to Invite and desire (for so they were glad in
that Juncture of Affairs to compliment his Sawci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness)
<hi>Wat</hi> to come and Treat thereof with the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:99794:15"/>
King; and when the Knight urged him to make
haste, he answered with some Indignation; <hi>If thou
art in such haste, go back to thy Master the King;
I'le come when I see mine own time.</hi> However he soon
followed him on Horse back, but slowly for the
greater State, and being come near the <hi>King,</hi> the
same Knight was commanded to go to him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
and bring back his Proposals. <hi>Tyler</hi> offended,
because this Messenger came to him mounted, told
him it became him to alight from his Horse in his
Presence; and therewith drew out his Dagger to
strike him: But the <hi>King</hi> to pacifie him, made him
alight. The <hi>Demands</hi> which <hi>Tyler</hi> made, besides a
general Enfranchisement of the Bond men, (which
the <hi>King</hi> had already granted) were, That all <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens,
Parks,</hi> and <hi>Chases,</hi> should be made common
and free to all, so that as well the Poor as the Rich,
should have liberty to Fish, Fowl, and Hunt in all
places throughout the Kingdom, with several
other the like extravagant Demands: In which
<hi>Tyler</hi> behaved himself so insolently, that the <hi>Kings</hi>
Attendants could not but represent to his Majesty
that it was insufferable, and the before celebrated
<hi>John Philpot,</hi> according to his usual Courage, told
the <hi>King,</hi> That if his <hi>Majesty</hi> would but command
his Lieutenant; <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Mayor</hi> to Arrest the <hi>Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi>
he would lose his Life if it were not happily
accomplisht; Whereupon the <hi>King</hi> was prevailed
with to give such a Command, or rather leave to
<hi>William Walworth,</hi> then <hi>Mayor</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> who
waiting an Opportunity, and observing <hi>Tyler</hi> to
play with his Dagger, tossing it from hand to hand,
as if he meant some mischief, and that at last (to
what intent is not known, whether out of rude<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ness,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:99794:16"/>
or design) he laid one of his hands upon the
<hi>Kings</hi> Bridle, fearing the <hi>Ruffian</hi> might attempt his
<hi>Royal Person,</hi> instantly executed his Arrest, by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
him a Blow on his Head with a Dagger;
which was seconded with <hi>Philpot</hi>'s Sword and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
in his Body, so that immediately he fell down
dead on the ground: When the Rabble saw this,
they began furiously to cry out, <hi>O our Captain is
slain, our Captain is murdered: Let's revenge the
Death of our Captain, &amp;c.</hi> But the <hi>King</hi> with a Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
and Ingenuity beyond any thing could be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
from his Years, (for he was not yet above
Fifteen) Clapt Spurs to his Horse and rod to the
Head of them, crying aloud, <hi>What mean you my
Men? Or what do you do? Will you shoot your King?
You shall have no cause to grieve for the Death of that
Traytor and Ribauld; I that am the King, will be your
Captain and your Leader: Follow me into the Field,
and you shall have whatever you will?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon which words, amaz'd, and not certainly
resolv'd either of one anothers minds, nor indeed
each man of his own, they followed awhile, till Sir
<hi>Richard Knolls,</hi> with a Thousand armed men raised
in the mean time by the <hi>Mayor,</hi> came upon them
out of the City, at whose approach (being now
headless, and all in confusion) they were so terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd,
that they forthwith flung down what Arms
they had, and begg'd for Mercy; which the <hi>King</hi>
granted, and withal gave them a <hi>Charter</hi> of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
in form as before recited; but proclaim'd,
that no Citizen should have any Correspondence
with any of them, nor suffer them to come within
the Liberties: And so this dreadful rout from the
height of Insolence was in a moment scattered and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:99794:16"/>
reduced to the depth of misery and fear, sneaking
back by stealth into the Country: many in their
passage slain or perishing for want, and multitudes
of them soon after Executed.</p>
            <p>For this good Service, the King upon the place
conferr'd the Honour of Knighthood upon the
said <hi>John Walworth</hi> Mayor, and <hi>John Philpot,</hi> as
likewise on <hi>Nichol. Brembre, John Land,</hi> and <hi>Nicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las
Twyford,</hi> Citizens of <hi>London.</hi> And in memory
of so Honourable an Exploit, perform'd by the
Mayor, the Dagger hath ('tis said) ever since
that time been added in the City-Arms, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
bore only the Cross.</p>
            <p>But though things were thus appeas'd at <hi>London,</hi>
there was still no less Hurley-burley in several
Counties: At St. <hi>Albans</hi> they committed many
Out-rages, and Cancell'd the Ancient Charter of
the <hi>Abbot</hi> and <hi>Monks.</hi> In <hi>Suffolk</hi> there were swarm'd
together Fifty thousand <hi>Villains,</hi> under the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of one <hi>John Straw,</hi> a lewd <hi>Priest,</hi> who behea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Sir <hi>John Cavendish,</hi> Lord Chief Justice of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>et his Head on the Pillory in S. <hi>Edmunds<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury.</hi>
The like Commotions also there were at the
same time in <hi>Norfolk, Cambridge-shire,</hi> and the <hi>Isle</hi>
of <hi>Ely,</hi> at the Instigation of one <hi>Littester,</hi> a Dyer,
who called himself King of the Commons, and
forc'd several Lords, and Persons of Quality to be
sworn to them, and ride along with them to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
their Proceedings; but these were for the
most part subdu'd and dispers'd, by the active va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of <hi>Hugh Spenser</hi> Bishop of <hi>Norwich,</hi> who ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
an Army together, set upon the Rebels
with incredible fury, pursuing them from place to
place, and giving no Quarter to any of them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:99794:17"/>
It is to be noted, That these Rebels in several
Shires held correspondence, and their Leaders sent

            <p>The <hi>Storm</hi> being thus happily over-blown, the
Rebels suddenly master'd, and a competent Force
raised to secure the Peace of the Kingdom, it was
quickly thought fit to revenge such an Affront, and
bring the <hi>Delinquents</hi> to justice. In order to which,
the King as soon as he could do it with safety to
Himself and the Publick, revokes his former Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

                     <hi>RICHARD,</hi> by the Grace of God,
King of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> and
Lord of <hi>Ireland;</hi> To all to whom these <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents</hi>
shall come, Greeting: Although in the
late detestable Disturbance, horribly made by
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:99794:19"/>
divers of Our Liege People and Subjects rising
up against Our Peace, certain Letters Patent
of Ours were made at the importunate Instance
of the <hi>Rebels,</hi> containing, <hi>That</hi> We have
freed all Our Leige People, Common Subjects,
and others of the several Counties of Our Realm
of <hi>England,</hi> and them, and every of them dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
and acquitted from all Bondage and
Service. <hi>And also,</hi> That we have pardoned
them all manner of Insurrections by them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Us made, and all manner of <hi>Treasons,
Felonies, Transgressions,</hi> and <hi>Extortions,</hi>
by them or any of them committed. <hi>As also,</hi>
all <hi>Outlawries</hi> Publisht against them, or any
of them, on those Occasions; Or that we have
granted to them and every of them Our firm
Peace: And that Our Will was, That Our said
Liege People and Subjects should be free to buy
and Sell in all Cities, Burroughs, Towns, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets,
and other Places within the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of
<hi>England;</hi> and that no Acre of Land which
holds in Bondage or Villenage, should be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
higher than at Four Pence; And if
any were before held for less, that it should not
be raised for the future. <hi>Yet</hi> for that such Our
Letters did Issue without Mature Deliberation,
and unduly, We well weighing, that the Grant
of the said Letters, doth manifestly tend to
the very great prejudice of Us and Our Crown,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:99794:19"/>
and to the <hi>Disinherison</hi> as well of us, and the
Prelates and Nobility of Our said Realms, as of
the <hi>Holy Anglicane Church,</hi> and also the
the <hi>Damage</hi> and <hi>Incommodity</hi> of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.</hi>
Therefore by the Advice of
Our <hi>Council,</hi> We have <hi>Revoked, made void,</hi>
and do <hi>utterly annul</hi> the said Letters, and
whatever hath been done or follow'd thereupon,
willing that none of what state or condition so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he be, shall any way have or reap, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
any liberty or benefit whatsoever, of or by
the said Letters. For We will, and 'tis our
intention, by the Advice of Our sound Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
for the future, to impart such Grace and
Favour to all and singular, although they have
grievously forfeited their Allegiance, as shall
be well-pleasing and profitable to Our Realm,
and with which Our faithful Subjects may
reasonably hold themselves contented. And this
we do notifie to all persons concern'd, by these
Presents, Commanding the same to be Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
in all Cities and Towns, Villages, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
And further We strictly require and command,
That all and singular as well Free as Bond-men,
shall without any contradiction, murmuring, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
or difficulty, do and perform the Works,
Customs, and Services, which to us or any
other their Lords they ought to do, and which
before the said Disturbance were used to be
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:99794:20"/>
done, without lessening or delaying the same.
And that they do not presume to require, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
or claim any other Liberties or Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
than what they reasonably had before
the said Tumults. And that all such as have
any of Our said Letters of Manumission and
Pardon in their Custody, shall immediately
bring and restore the same to Us and our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
to be Cancelled, upon the Faith and Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance
in which to Us they are bound, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
pain of forfeiting All that to Us they can
forfeit for the future. <hi>In testimony where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi>
We have caused these Our Letters to be

During these Uproars, the Duke of <hi>Lancaster,</hi>
(very happily for the preservation of his Person,
against whom the Commons had so great a spite)
was gone into the <hi>North</hi> against the <hi>Scots,</hi> but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Tidings of the Insurrection, thought fit to
clap up a Truce for Two years, which he got ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
upon Oath some days before the <hi>Scots</hi> had
any notice of the Troubles in <hi>England;</hi> but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
himself in danger, for the general (though
false) report was, that the King to pacifie the <hi>Rebels</hi>
had consented to abandon him to their pleasure,
when ever they could seize him, and having recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
some Affronts in that distress from the Earl
of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> he desired of the <hi>Scots</hi> a safe
Conduct, and to reside for a time amongst them,
who honourably entertain'd him, till he was sent for
by the <hi>King,</hi> and then a new cause of grudge hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
between him and the Earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi>
for in his return he was denied passage through the
Town of <hi>Barwick,</hi> by the Captain Sir <hi>Matthew Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
by vertue of a Command from the said Earl
Lord <hi>Warden</hi> of the <hi>Marches,</hi> not to suffer any
from <hi>Scotland</hi> to enter the same, which indeed the
King had specially ordered, forgetting the <hi>Dukes</hi>
being then in that Kingdom. However this bred
such an Animosity in the <hi>Duke</hi> against the Earl,
that being come home, he charged him with seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
things, which the Earl as stoutly answered, and
great numbers of armed men followed each of
them, but the King taking their Differences into
his own ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>About <hi>All-hallontide,</hi> began a <hi>Parliament,</hi> but
had not accomplisht any thing of moment before
they were adjourn'd till after <hi>Christmas,</hi> by reason
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:99794:21"/>
of the arrival of the new Queen, Sister of <hi>Wynce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus</hi>
King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and elected Emperor: an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance
of some <hi>honour,</hi> but little <hi>profit</hi> to the <hi>Realm,</hi>
she being followed with a multitude of <hi>insatiate
Bohemians;</hi> who by the <hi>Kings</hi> facility, drain'd abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of Wealth out of the <hi>Kingdom.</hi> It was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
that as soon as ever she set foot on shore at
<hi>Dover,</hi> an horrible Storm arose at Sea, which so
tossed the Ships in the Harbour, that the same
which her Majesty came in, was immediately dasht
to pieces; which some then lookt upon as Omi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous,
presaging Tempests of State to follow her.</p>
            <p>[1382.] The Nuptial Solemnities, which were
very splendid and costly, being over, the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
meets again, to begin the <hi>New Year,</hi> in which
several wholsom Laws were ordain'd; as to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
Merchant-strangers freely to sell their Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizes
here, to regulate Excesses in in the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel
of inferiour people, to settle the price of
Wines, and many other matters. But, <hi>what</hi> (saith

Practices) <hi>signifie Acts of Parliaments, when after
they are made, they take no effect, or are nothing regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,

                  </gap> aside all things, that by ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
consent had in Parliament been established.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of the truth whereof, there were too many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
Instances, as amongst the rest, in this very <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi>
upon the request of the Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
Sir. <hi>R. Scroop</hi> was by the <hi>King</hi> appointed Lord
Chancellor as being a Person of known Judgment,
Learning, and inflexible Integrity; but within few
Months he was turn'd out of that Office, (which
he had laudably and prudently administred) meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:99794:21"/>
because to do the King faithful Service he had
displeased some of his unworthy <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nors:</hi> the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of which, I shall set down in <hi>Walsinghams</hi>
own Words. <hi>Edmund Mortimer,</hi> Earl of <hi>March,</hi>
and several other Lords, being lately dead, certain
greedy and ambitious Knights and Squires, and
others of inferior Rank, that were Servants to the
King, had begged of him Grants of divers Lands
and Lordships, lately belonging to the deceased,
that they might have the profits thereof, for so
long time as the King by the Custom of the <hi>Realm,</hi>
was to hold them in his Hands; which the King,
not minding the value, nor considering any reason
they had to desire, or merit to deserve, such Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues,
presently consents to, ordering them to the
Chancellor to have their Grants confirm'd under
the great Seal; but the prudent and honest Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor,
who zealously desired the prosperity of the
Kingdom, and just profit of the King, absolutely
refused to do it; telling them, the King was much
in debt, and 'twas most necessary he should reserve
such Contingencies to himself, therewith in part to
satisfy his Creditors; and that since they well knew
such the Kings urgent occasions, they could be no
good Subjects to his Majesty, that consulting their
own advantages more than his service, and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
private lucre before publick necessities, should
go about to circumvent, and further impoverish
him, by such prejudicial Requests, from which
they should do well to desist, and be content with
his Majesties former Largesses, which were suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
for them.</p>
            <p>Nettled with this repulse, these Courtiers resort
back to the King, grievously complaining of the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:99794:22"/>
Chancellors Obstinacy, that he contemned his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
Command, and that it concerned his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
suddenly, and with due severity, to Chastise
such an affronted disobedience; for otherwise the
Royal Authority would become contemptible to
all his People, and his Command be accounted of
no value, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The young King therefore more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding
the false suggestions of these self-design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
flatterers, than the faithful allegations and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of his Chancellor, sends in his fury messengers
to demand the Seal of him, but the Chancellor
would deliver it to no hands but the Kings. To
whom having surrendered it, he was pleased to
retain it for many days in his own Custody, Seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Grants therewith himself, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Till at length
the keeping of it was conferr'd on <hi>Braibrook</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this last mentioned <hi>Parliament, John Wickliff</hi>
exhibited a certain Complaint, or <hi>Articles,</hi> chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
against the Abuses of <hi>Monks, Fryars, &amp;c.</hi> An Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract
of the substance whereof is as follows.</p>
            <q>
               <p>1. <hi>Article,</hi> That all Persons of what Kind, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
Sect, or singular Religion soever, made or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
by men, may freely without any let or pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishment,
leave the same at their pleasure, and are
only bound stably to hold the Rule of Jesus Christ,
taken and given by him and his Apostles, and far
more profitable than such new Religions founded by
sinful men.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Art.</hi> That those things which men have unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably
and wrongfully condemned; As, <hi>That the
King cannot take away the Goods of Prelates,
Monks,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>misbehaving themselves, or the like;</hi>
may be vindicated and asserted, and the contrary
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:99794:22"/>
Errour condemning them Exposed: For that nothing
ought to be condemned, unless it savour of Errour or
unrighteousness against Gods Law.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Art.</hi> That both Tythes and Offerings be given,
paid, and received, with and to the same intent only,
as by Gods Law they ought; that is, that what is
more than sufficient to serve the Priests, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaries,
be given to the Poor: And that if they be
abused to luxury or covetousness, then they may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
be taken away.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>Art.</hi> That Christs Doctrine, and the Belief
touching the Sacrament plainly delivered by him and
his Apostles, be openly taught in Churches, and the
contrary Teaching and false Belief, brought up by cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Hypocrites and worldy Priests, exploded.</p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>Wickliff</hi>'s preferring these Articles (which he
at large Confirmed both by <hi>Authorities</hi> and
<hi>Reason)</hi> stirred up fresh hatred against him in
the <hi>Ecclesiasticks,</hi> and procured him much
trouble.</p>
            <p>Wherefore because <hi>all Papists</hi> so furiously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn

and <hi>Blindness</hi> of the Age he
lived in. And since his Story,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:99794:23"/>
is one of the <hi>Remarkables</hi> of this King <hi>Richard</hi>'s
Reign, it will not be impertinent briefly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
the same.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wickliff</hi> is said to be descended of an <hi>ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily</hi>
in the <hi>North,</hi> but the exact year of his Birth
we do not find Recorded; he was Educated in
<hi>Merton Colledge</hi> in <hi>Oxford,</hi> became first <hi>Divinity
Reader</hi> in that Famous University, and afterwards
<hi>Rector</hi> of <hi>Lutterworth</hi> in <hi>Leicester shire:</hi> Touching
his Parts, his Contemporary <hi>Henry de Knyghton,</hi>
Cannon of <hi>Leicester,</hi> (and by consequence none of
his Friends) does yet give this Honorable Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter,
<hi>That he was the most eminent Doctor of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of those times, second to none in Philosophy, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable
for School learning, and transcending most
both in subtilty of Science, and profoundness of Wit.</hi>
These great Abilities enabled him quickly to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
the <hi>Falsity</hi> of the Doctrines, and the <hi>Cheat</hi> of
the Practices then in vogue in the Church: For in
his Studies, he had run through the whole Course
of the <hi>School-men;</hi> and amongst them was a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
Follower of <hi>Occham,</hi> by reading whose
Works, and others that lived about the same
time, or not long before, such as <hi>Bradwardine,
Marsilius, Gulielmus de Sancto Amore, Abelardus,
Armachanus,</hi> and the Learned <hi>Grosthead</hi> Bishop of
<hi>Lincoln:</hi> God gave him Grace to see the Truth
of his Gospel, and by seeing it, to <hi>loath</hi> Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Popery. By <hi>Occham</hi> and <hi>Marsilius</hi> he
was informed of the Popes Intrusions and Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations
upon Kings, their Crowns and Dignities.
Of <hi>Gul. de S. Amore</hi> and <hi>Armachanus,</hi> he learned
the sundry Abuses of the <hi>Monks</hi> and <hi>Fryars</hi> in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
this Usurped Power. By <hi>Abelard</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:99794:23"/>
he got a Prospect of the <hi>Right Faith</hi> touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of the <hi>Lords Supper.</hi> By <hi>Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardine</hi>
he was instructed in the nature of a true
<hi>Sole Justifying Faith,</hi> against <hi>Merit-mongers,</hi> and
<hi>Pardoners, Pelagians, &amp;c.</hi> Finally by perusing
<hi>Grosthead</hi>'s Works (in which he seemed to be
most conversant) he descryed the <hi>Pope</hi> to be <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist,</hi>
by hindring the Preaching of the Gospel,
and placing unfit men in the Church, only to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
his own <hi>Tyranny.</hi> And being thus enlightned,
his Zeal to Truth would not suffer him to Conceal
his Candle under a Bushel: And therefore those
that assign'd his being depriv'd of a <hi>Benefice</hi> in <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
to be the occasion of first spreading his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
and would attribute all to <hi>Resentment</hi> and
<hi>Revenge,</hi> speak either <hi>rashly</hi> or <hi>maliciously,</hi> no such
provocation being so much as mentioned by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
of best Credit, to occasion his preaching a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Corruptious of the Times; nor is it
likely that he would have so inveighed against
<hi>Clergy-covetousness and Pride,</hi> if they could have
retorted on him any such cause of his Discontent;
or how can we but imagine, that if he had affected
any such small Business as the <hi>Headship</hi> of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury
Colledge,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Lancaster</hi> (who was
his Great <hi>Patron)</hi> could have helpt him to it.
For indeed the Fame of his Learning, his unwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
diligence in Preaching and Writing, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with his pious exemplary <hi>Life,</hi> procured him
many <hi>Disciples</hi> amongst the People, and several
Favorers of the first Rank: The rather, for that
he justly opposed the Ambition and Avarice of
the Clergy, a <hi>Theme</hi> no less grateful than ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary;
for the Temporal States-men already
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:99794:24"/>
found it to be an insufferable Grievance, though
they wanted Skill or Courage to abate it. King
<hi>Edward</hi> the Third (though a great <hi>Doter</hi> on Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticks)
is supposed not to have been his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy;
and 'tis certain the pious Duke of <hi>Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi>
(so our Author <hi>Knyghton</hi> always calls him)
and several of the Nobles were much his Friends,
and Protectors against the Rage of the Prelates;
for <hi>Wickliff</hi> being in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s days Cited to
Answer before the Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the
Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> and others in <hi>Pauls,</hi> the said
Duke, and Sir <hi>Henry Piercy</hi> Lord Marshal, were
pleased to attend him thither, and would needs
have him <hi>sit</hi> in presence of the Court, alleaging
he had much to answer, and therefore needed
convenient ease; which favor the Bishop of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
refusing to grant, hard words arose between
the Temporal and Spiritual Lords; insomuch that
the Duke threatned he would <hi>pull down the pride
of all the Bishops of</hi> England: And by reason of
their Contest, <hi>Wickliff</hi> for the present got off, and
little was done against him.</p>
            <p>But in the beginning of King <hi>Richards</hi> Reign,
the Pope sent a <hi>Bull</hi> to the University of <hi>Oxford,</hi>
upbraiding them with suffering and countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
<hi>Wickliff</hi> and his Doctrine, and charging them
on pain of being deprived of all their <hi>Priviledges</hi>
and <hi>Indulgences,</hi> that they should no longer tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
the same. But the <hi>Heads</hi> of the University
were so well satisfied with <hi>Wickliffe</hi>'s Integrity,
that they were at a stand whether they should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the said <hi>Bull,</hi> or reject it with Contempt:
However the Pope plyed both the King and the
Arch-bishop, and Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> with seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:99794:24"/>
other Letters and Bulls to the same effect; So
that at last, <hi>Wickliff</hi> was again Conven'd before
them; but on the Day assign'd for his Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Sir <hi>Lewis Clifford</hi> came into their Court, and
in the Name of the <hi>Princess Joan,</hi> the Kings Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
peremptorily Commanded them to proceed
no further in that Affair; with which being ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified,
they desisted their prosecution, and once
more he got out of their Clutches.</p>
            <p>But now by reason of the before-mentioned Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
offered to the King and Parliament, the
Bishops soon after summoned him again before
them, but whether he appeared or not, is uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain:
However they proceeded against the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
and Conclusions following, as <hi>His,</hi> which

            <p>About these Positions the Bishops first met at
<hi>Oxford</hi> (where they had taken such impression, that
<hi>Riggs</hi> the Vice-Chancellor, and many others had
imbraced them) and after that at the <hi>Gray-Fryars
London,</hi> on the Seventeenth of <hi>May,</hi> 1382. on
which day after Dinner, about Two a Clock, just
as they were going to proceed in this Business,
happened a Wonderful and Terrible <hi>Earthquake</hi>
throughout all <hi>England;</hi> whereupon divers of the
Suffragans being affrighted, would have desisted,
but the Arch-bishop otherwise interpreting the
Omen, they went on, and at last solemnly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
all the said Propositions, there being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Eight <hi>Bishops,</hi> Nineteen <hi>Monks</hi> and <hi>Fryars,</hi>
Fourteen <hi>Doctors</hi> of Law, and Six <hi>Batchellors</hi> of

            <p>However Mr. <hi>Wickliff</hi> himself (whether be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they could not find him: or that they were
afraid to meddle with him) or rather because they
were much distracted by reason of the Feuds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
two <hi>Popes</hi> then in being at once, escaped their
malice; and in the Year 1385. dyed peaceably
in his Bed, having been Doctor of Divinity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
Thirty Years, and of such industry and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that he Translated the whole Bible into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish;</hi>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:99794:27"/>
one Copy whereof written with his own
Hand, lately was, and I suppose still is extant
in Saint <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Colledge</hi> in <hi>Oxford:</hi> He lived in
a time, when the <hi>Fryars</hi> Orders by their mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
disorders were become exceeding odious,
and the <hi>Popes</hi> jurisdiction by provisions, Reservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and Collations very intollerable, which made
way for those excellent statute Laws about this
time enacted, of <hi>Premunice,</hi> against <hi>Provisors,</hi> and
the abuses of <hi>Begging Fryars;</hi> which so bridled and
restrained the <hi>Popes Rampant</hi> Usurpations, that he
could but little prevail here in <hi>England,</hi> during the
Reign of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, and King <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi>

<hi>Wickliffe</hi>'s Doctrine struck a great stroak, he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining

all kind of Encroachments, by the Laws, <hi>Civil, Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi>
and <hi>Common,</hi> of which last especially he made
great use, and was well skill'd therein. But for full

                  <p>Wherefore we signify unto you by these presents, that
his Conversation (even from his youth upwards, unto
the time of his death) was so praise-worthy and honest,
that never at any time was there any note or spot of sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion
noised of him, but in his answering, reading,
preaching, and determining, he behaved himself lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
and as a stout Champion of the Faith, vanquishing
by the force of the Scriptures, all such who by their wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

himself.</p>
               <p>That none is truly a Prelate, nor capable of a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoprick,
unless he be a Teacher and Preacher.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:99794:28"/>
That Money got by Confessions is accursed, and as
well the giver as receiver Excommunicate.</p>
               <p>That Preachers carrying about Baggs and Scripps,
are false Teachers, since Christ in his Gospel Commands
the contrary, and the true Disciples of Christ never
practised it.</p>
               <p>That for those to Begg, who are able to work is
Condemned by the Law Civil, and no where approved

               <p>That Christ Converted many of divers States and

            </q>
            <p>These Opinions spreading so fast, and the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
perceiving that yet they had not sufficient
Authority by any Law, or Statute of this <hi>Realm,</hi>
to proceed unto Death or Imprisonment, against
any for matters of Religion, they therefore so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited
the King for the power of the Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Sword, who overcome with their importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
or perhaps incited by hopes of some Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidy
to be given him by the Clergy was content
to give his Assent to an Ordinance, bearing the
name of an Act, made in the Parliament hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den

from Town to Town, in certain Habits under
dissimulation of great Holiness; and without the
License of the Ordinaries of the places, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sufficient Authority, Preaching daily, not
only in Churches and Church-yards, but also in
Markets, Fairs, and open Places, where a great
Congregation of People is, divers Sermons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
Heresies, and notorious Errors, to the
great emblemishing of Christian Faith, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of thr Laws, and of the Estate of Holy
Church, to the great Peril of the Souls of the
People, and of all the Realm of England, as
more plainly is found, and sufficiently proved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Reverend Father in God the Archbishop
of Canterbury, and the Bishops, and other Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates,
Masters of Divinity, and Doctors of the
Canon, and of Civil Law, and a great part of
the Clergy of the said Realm, specially assembled
for this great cause; which Persons do also
Preach divers matters of slaunder, to ingender,
discord, and dissention betwixt divers Estates of
the said Realm, as well Spiritual as Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
in exciting of the People to the great Peril
of all the Realm, which Preachers cited or sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned
before the Ordinaries of the places, there to
answer to that whereof they be impeached, they
will not obey their Summons and Commands,
nor care not for their Monitions, nor Censures of

moreover by their subtil and ingenious
words do draw the People to hear their

It is ordained and assented in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Parliament, That the Kings Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions
be made, and directed to the
Sheriffs, and other Ministers of our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign
Lord the King, or other sufficient
persons learned, and according to the Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications
of the Prelates thereof, to be
made in the Chancery from time to time,
to arrest all such Preachers, and also their
Fauters, Maintainers, and Abetters,
and to hold them in Arrest and strong
Prison, till they will justifie to them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the law and reason of Holy
Church. And the King willeth and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth,
that the Chancellor make such
Commissions at all times, that he by the
Prelates, or any of them shall be certified,
and thereof required as is aforesaid.</p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>This was the first pretence of Statute
against the true Professors of Religion, and
indeed was no Act of Parliament duly
made, but onely by the King and the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
for at <hi>Michaelm.</hi> following, in the sixth
year of the King, a Parliament being as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled
complain'd thereof, and having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:99794:30"/>
the same—Add</hi>—<q>The which was
never agreed nor granted by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons;
but whatsoever was moved
therein, was without their Assent; and
therefore prayen the Commons, that the
said Statute be disannulled, for it is not
in any wise their meaning, that either
themselves or such as shall succeed them,
shall be further justified, or bound by the
Prelates, than were their Ancestors in
former times. Whereunto it is answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>Il plaist au Roy,</hi> The King is pleased.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Yet though the supposed Law of the Fifth were
hereby so repealed, and the fraud thereof discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
the Prelates ordered matters so, that this Act
of Repeal was never published, nor since printed in
the Statute Book with the rest of the Acts of that
Parliament, as Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> in his Acts and Monuments
well observes.</p>
            <p>The Year 1383 was famous for a Warlike Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition
undertaken by the <hi>English Clergie,</hi> called a
<hi>Croisado,</hi> or going forth to fight the <hi>Lords Battels</hi>
(as they pretended) under the Banner of the <hi>Cross.</hi>
The occasion thus:</p>
            <p>After the death of Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the Eleventh,
which happened in the Year of our Lord 1378,
one <hi>Bartholomew</hi> Bishop of <hi>Barri</hi> in <hi>Apulia,</hi> by the
undue acts hereafter mentioned got into the
Chair, by the name of <hi>Vrban</hi> the Sixth; who as
he entered by force, so he proceeded with so much
pride and insolence, that most of the Cardinals for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sook
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:99794:30"/>
him, and retiring to <hi>Avignion</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> chose
one <hi>Robert</hi> Bishop of <hi>Cibbo</hi> in his stead, who took
upon him the style of Pope <hi>Clement.</hi> Now to destroy
him, and all that own'd and took part with him,
was the meritorious design. And that the Reader
may the better perceive the nature of the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel,
and what mighty reason people had to venture
their Lives, and murder their Neighbours, for this
<hi>Vrbans</hi> Interest, I shall insert a Copy of the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals
Letter to him, as <hi>Walsingham</hi> recites it.</p>

that none should own or obey <hi>Vrban</hi> on pain of

Letters to King <hi>Richard</hi> and the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
and his honouring our Bishop of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
with a Cardinals Cap, <hi>England</hi> was altogether
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:99794:34"/>
at his devotion; for in the second year of King
<hi>Richard</hi> an Act was made, declaring him to be

into the Kings hands, and the King to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered

within this Realm should procure or obtain any
Provision or other Instrument from any other Pope
than the same <hi>Vrban,</hi> should be out of the Kings
Protection.</p>
            <p>And this year 1382, the said <hi>Vrban</hi> sent over
his Bull to <hi>Henry Spencer</hi> Bishop of <hi>Norwich</hi> (a
young bold Prelate) to raise a <hi>Croisado,</hi> that is,
to levy Forces who should be all mark'd with the
Cross, as engag'd in an Holy War, to fight with
and subdue his Enemy the said <hi>Clement,</hi> the Anti-Pope,
and all his Followers and Favourers, whom
thereby he did excommunicate and depose from
all Honours, and forbid any Conversation with
them living, and burial of their bodies when dead,
&amp;c. In which Bull were (amongst other things)
granted the Powers and Privileges following.</p>
            <q>
               <p>1. That the said Bishop of <hi>Norwich</hi> may use
the Sword against the Anti-Pope and all his Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,

               <p>2. That he hath full power to inquire of all and
singular such <hi>Schismaticks,</hi> and put them in prison,
and to confiscate all their Goods moveable and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable.</p>
               <p>3. That he hath Power and Authority to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
all Laymen that are such <hi>Schismaticks,</hi> of
all manner of Secular Offices whatsoever, and to
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:99794:35"/>
give their Offices to other fit and convenient Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</p>
               <p>4. To deprive all such Schismatick Clerks, and
bestow their Benefices either with or without
Cure, their Dignities, Parsonages, or Offices to
other Persons more meet for the same, having
power over Lay-persons that are exempt, Clerks
both Secular and Regular, yea though they be
Fryars Mendicants.</p>
               <p>5. That he may dispense with any Dignified or
Beneficed Clerks, so that they may be absent from
their Cures or Benefices, under the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Cross, without leave of any of their Prelates,
and yet take and receive the entire Profits, as
though personally resident.</p>
               <p>6. There is granted to all that pass the Seas in
this Cause, either at their own Expences, or at
the Expences of any others, <hi>Full Remission of
all their Sins,</hi> and besides as large Priviledges
as to any that pay their Money, or go to Fight for
the Holy Land.</p>
               <p>7. That all such as shall with their proper
Goods and Substance give sufficient Stipend to
able Souldiers at the discretion of the aforesaid Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
mustred, or by any other his Deputy, although
themselves be not personally engaged, yet shall
they have the like Remission and Indulgence, as
they which in person go to the Expedition.</p>
               <p>8. That all they shall be Partakers of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
who shall give any part of their Goods to
the said Bishop, to Fight against the said Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks.</p>
               <p>9. That if any shall chance to die in the Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
or be kill'd, that are Souldiers under the said
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:99794:35"/>
Standard of the Cross, they shall fully and wholly
receive the said Grace, and shall be Partakers of
the aforesaid Forgiveness and Indulgence.</p>
               <p>10. The said Bishop hath Power to Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate,
Suspend, and Interdict all persons whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
that shall be Rebellious, or Disturbers of him
in the Execution of the Powers and Authority
hereby committed unto him, of whatsoever Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
or Condition they be, whether Kings, Queens,
Emperors, or of any other Quality Ecclesiastical or
Temporal.</p>
               <p>Lastly, That he may compel and inforce any
Religious Persons whatsoever, to go in this Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
and send them over Sea, if he think good
so to do, and this although they be Professors of
the Fryars Mendicants.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Being thus furnisht the Bishop to spread his
Authority, and the more effectually carry on the
Work, publisht the Ordinances following.</p>
            <q>
               <p>1. IT is Ordained for the Honour, the Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment
of Holy Church, and the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of the Realm, that sufficient Preachers
be sent into all the Country, to Declare and
Publish the <hi>Croisado,</hi> and the Right Estate of
Holy Church, and of our most Holy Father
Pope <hi>Urban,</hi> whom God (of his benign Grace)
pity and redress, according to his good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>
               <p>2. That to every such Preacher or Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor
throughout <hi>England,</hi> there shall be joyned
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:99794:36"/>
a Clerk, who shall receive and register the
Names of all such as shall offer their persons to
this Holy War; and also all money that shall be
given, over whom the said Confessors shall be
Controllers.</p>
               <p>3. That no Woman shall presume to go this
voyage without special Licence from the Bishop
of <hi>Norwich</hi> under his Seal.</p>
               <p>4. That no man by the way shall rob, or by
any kind of Extortion take the goods of any till
they come upon the Enemies, where they may
do it by right of War, on pain of losing all share
in the said Pardon.</p>
               <p>5. That the said Preachers shall press the
people to say Prayers and make Processions for
the safety of the Church, and the prosperity of
this V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rage.</p>
               <p>6. That all Curates on pain of Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
shall encourage, and by all means they
can (especially in Confession) press and engage
their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>arishioners, as well poor as rich, to come
into and contribute to this pious Expedition, so
much for the good of the Church, and advantage
of their own Souls.</p>
               <p>7. That every one that will go in person for
the Absolution, shall before such Absolution be
given him, swear to come to the said Bishop or
his Deputy, and make his Indentures touching
the time that he purposes to serve in the <hi>Croi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sado.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:99794:36"/>
8. That if any will find a man, that is,
hire another to go in his name, and upon his
costs and charges, that he must either provide
and able sufficient Souldier that shall nor refuse
the Service, or else allow so much for his Pay
to the Bishop, and let him provide one him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
               <p>9. That every one that sends such a Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
in his own stead, shall enroll in the Bishops
Registry both his own and his Souldiers name
before he takes Absolution, otherwise to lose
all benefit of the Pardon.</p>

            <p>The business being thus published with all the
<hi>zeal and art</hi> of the Clergy, the Bishop thereupon
collected an innumerable and incredible Summe
of Money, besides abundance of Plate both Gold
and Silver, <hi>Jewels, Rings, Dishes, Spoons, Brace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets,</hi>
(they are all our Authors own words, who
lived at that time) <hi>Necklaces, and other ornaments,
especially of Ladies and others of the Female Sex;</hi>
for 'twas said, one Lady gave an hundred pounds,
and so others some more some less, and many
even beyond their ability as was believed, so fond
were they to obtain the imaginary benefit of <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution</hi>
for themselves or their Friends; (for by
this they might not onely save their own Souls,
but free whom they pleas'd that were dead from
pains of Purgatory, or ensure the Salvation of
any Child or Relation living.) And so all the
secret Treasure of the Kingdom, that was in the
custody of these foolish weaker Vessels was endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger'd,
for otherwise they were not to be absol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
if they did not contribute to their power
and ability. Many men went in person at their
own charge, others that were old, or weak, or ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous,
sent Souldiers and bore their expences.
For the Bishop had got most admirable Indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
both for the quick and dead, and could ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
<hi>&amp; à poena &amp; à culpa,</hi> as well from the guilt
or offence, as from all punishment due for sin. And
'twas said, that some of his Commissioners did as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:99794:37"/>
               <hi>That at their commands Angels would descend
from Heaven, and snatch Souls from out of the pains
of Purgatory, and without delay carry them to rights
into heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whilest the <hi>warlike Bishop</hi> was making these
<hi>Preparations</hi> comes a <hi>Parliament,</hi> where it was De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated,
whether it where <hi>safe</hi> to hazard so consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

Quarrel, and under the Conduct of a rash

the <hi>Interest of Religion</hi> urg'd <hi>Reason of State
That now was the time for the King to recover his
Right in</hi> France, <hi>and weaken the French King, when
he lay under Pope</hi> Urban's <hi>Curse, for siding with Pope</hi>
Clement, <hi>during which he could expect no Success
on his Armes.</hi> Thus for some time very doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
it was which way the <hi>Parliament</hi> would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline;

               <hi>May,</hi> the Bishop
was ready to put to Sea with his Army lying
in <hi>Kent</hi> waiting for a Wind, the King (whether
designing quite to forbid the Voyage, or think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Bishop had got too much Money, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

know not) sent him a <hi>Writ</hi> to come back and
speak with his Majesty and know his pleasure; but
the <hi>proud Prelate</hi> mistrusting the worse, was so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
upon the Affair of his Lord and Master the
<hi>Pope,</hi> that he had no leisure to obey his <hi>King</hi> and
therefore to avoid any stops, presently hastned
over to <hi>Calice,</hi> leaving his Army to follow him,
which being arriv'd, he set up the Standard of
the <hi>Cross,</hi> and besiges <hi>Graveling,</hi> and takes it
and several other places, using great Cruelties,
and destroying all they could Master: For as the
Episcopal Generall was a person rash and daring,
and inflam'd with mad Zeal, so his Soulders con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiding
in their <hi>Absolutions,</hi> adventur'd upon the
greatest dangers without fear, esteeming, says
<hi>Walsingham,</hi> it <hi>Glory</hi> to overcome, but <hi>Gain</hi> to
die in this Cause<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where they thought themselves
sure to go directly to Heaven, and to enjoy so
much the greater Bliss the more they butcher'd of
the <hi>Schismaticks:</hi> But these first Fervours were
quckly cool'd by hard Service, and having in vain
laid Siege to <hi>Ypres,</hi> they are at last forc'd to quit
it, being all in Confusion amongst themselves,
and in great want of Provisions; whence they come
back to <hi>Graveling,</hi> and therein are besieg'd by
the <hi>French King</hi> with a powerfull Army; In
which Distress our Bishop wrote to King <hi>Richard,</hi>
That if ever he intended to try his Fortune against
the <hi>French King,</hi> now was the time, or at least that
he should send some Forces to give him Battle, and
force him to abandon the Siege: King <hi>Richard</hi>
was then at <hi>Daintry</hi> in <hi>Northamptonsheire,</hi> and on
the receipt of this News being at Supper, instantly
arose from Table, and in mighty rage and fury
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:99794:38"/>
               <hi>took Horse,</hi> riding Post with such speed, that he
came to Sant <hi>Albans</hi> at Midnight, where having
borrowed the Abbots Guelding (which <hi>Walsing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
a Monk of that Abbey complains he never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor'd)
he hastned to <hi>Westminster,</hi> making shew
as if he would never rest till he had Routed the
<hi>French King</hi> and all his Host, but being some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
weary with Riding, at <hi>Westminster,</hi> he went
to Bed, and having <hi>taken council of his Pillow, was</hi>
nothing so fierce next Morning, but resolv'd to
lay aside the thoughts of going himself, and to send
some body else: To which purpose, the Duke of
<hi>Lancaster</hi> was nominated, but so tedious in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Preparations, that the Bishop in the mean
time was glad to leave <hi>Graveling,</hi> having first dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantled
and destroyed it, and so return'd home
to <hi>England,</hi> after a vast Treasure dissipated,
and many thousand Lives lost, and more Souls
cheated, with as <hi>little Glory,</hi> as he set forth with
<hi>mighty Expectation,</hi> the <hi>Success</hi> of his <hi>Armes</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
suitable to the <hi>ridiculous occasion</hi> of them. And
what was yet worse for the haughty Prelate, soon
after his coming home in a <hi>Parliament,</hi> held at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
about <hi>Alhallontide,</hi> all his <hi>Temporalities</hi>
were seized into the Kings hands, for his Contempt
in disobeying the Kings <hi>Writ,</hi> when His Majesty
sent to him to come back just as he was putting to
Sea on this piece of <hi>Ecclesiastical Knight-Erran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi>
and he refused to come as aforesaid.</p>
            <p>In this Parliament also was granted to the King
half a <hi>Fifteenth</hi> by the <hi>Laity,</hi> and half a <hi>Tenth</hi> by
the <hi>Clergy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Year 1384, a <hi>Truce</hi> was made with

               <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Woodstock</hi> entred <hi>Scotland</hi> with a

with Want and cold Weather, they return'd, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
very small Advantages by that expensive Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition.</p>
            <p>Soon after which, an <hi>Irish Carmelite Fryer</hi>
made a discovery in Writing to the King of a

and cleared, or seemed to clear himself so much
to the Kings satisfaction, that the poor <hi>Fryer</hi> was
committed to Custody; and 'tis said, on the Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

Treasons,</hi> than to <hi>act them,</hi> which yet should dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
no good Subject from the discharge of his
Duty. But possibly this whole Accusation, or the
Relation of such a thing might be a <hi>Contrivance</hi>
of the Duke's Enemies, to render him suspected
to the King and odious to the People; for it 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
they entred not many Months after into a
<hi>formal-Design</hi> against his Life: the occasion where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
I do not find mentioned by Authors, but only
that the King by the Instigation of his young <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal-Council</hi>
had conceiv'd displeasure against him;
and that they had conspired to take away the
said Duke's Life. In order whereunto certain
<hi>Crimes</hi> were suggested, <hi>Appellors</hi> prepared, and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:99794:39"/>
twas agreed that he should be suddenly Arrested,
and brought before the <hi>Lord Chief Justice Trysi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi>
who had boldly untertaken to pronounce Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
upon him according to the quality of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
to be objected (though by Law he could not be
tryed but by his <hi>(Peers)</hi> and so <hi>Execution</hi> should
immediately have followed. But the Duke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fore warn'd of these Contrivances, hastned
to his Castle of <hi>Pomfret,</hi> and there stood upon his
Guard: And the King's Mother considering the
Dangers that would ensue such a <hi>Rupture,</hi> took
great pains by riding (notwithstanding her Age
and corpulency) to and fro between the King
and him, to pacifie each side, and at last brought
them to such a <hi>Reconcilement,</hi> that all appearance
of <hi>Displeasure</hi> on the one part, and <hi>Distrust</hi> on the
other, was for that time removed.</p>
            <p>About the Feast of S. <hi>Martin</hi> was held a <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment</hi>
at <hi>London,</hi> wherein the Earl of <hi>Nothum<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>berland</hi>
was Condemn'd for the loss of the Castle
of <hi>Barwick</hi> Surprised by the <hi>Scots,</hi> through the
Treachery of one that he had put in there as his
Deputy: But the King after Judgment was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to <hi>Pardon</hi> him, who went forthwith down and
retook the said Castle.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1385 the <hi>French</hi> made great Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations
for the <hi>Invading of England,</hi> and to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitate
the Attempt by a <hi>Diversion,</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>end the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral
of <hi>France</hi> with a considerable <hi>Force</hi> into
<hi>Scotland,</hi> the Common <hi>Back-door</hi> at which they
were wont to Infest us: Of which King <hi>Richard</hi>
having notice, raises a mighty Army, and by
speedy Marches pierces into the Heart of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
and reduc'd their chief City <hi>Edenburgh</hi> into Ashes
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:99794:40"/>
as a <hi>Bonfire,</hi> to give the whole Kingdom notice
of his Arrival, and Challenge them to Battel: But
they declined it, and Victuals growing very scarce,
the King thought fit to return homewards, the
rather for that the <hi>Scots</hi> in the mean time had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
<hi>Nothumberland,</hi> and besieg'd <hi>Carlile;</hi> but
hearing of the Kings approach, fled back into
<hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>During this Expedition, the Lord <hi>John Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
the Kings Brother by the Mother side, near
<hi>York,</hi> Killed the eldest Son of the Earl of <hi>Stafford,</hi>
for which he fled, and the King was so highly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed,
that he caused all his <hi>goods</hi> to be Confis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated;
the <hi>King's Mother</hi> interceded for him, but
could not be heard, and resented the denial so
heavily, that soon after she <hi>died.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At a <hi>Parliament</hi> the latter end of this Year the
<hi>Laity</hi> granted the King one <hi>Fifteenth and an half</hi>
upon condition that the Clergy would give a
<hi>Tenth and an half,</hi> who took this <hi>Articulating</hi> of
the <hi>Commons</hi> in grievous dudgeon, protesting,
that the <hi>Laity</hi> should not <hi>Charge them;</hi> and the
<hi>Archbishop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury</hi> was <hi>so hot,</hi> as to declare,
he would rather venture his Head in this <hi>Cause,</hi>
than that the <hi>Holy Church of England</hi> should thus
Truckle: whereupon the <hi>Commons</hi> and many of
the <hi>Temporal Lords</hi> began to bid Battel to the
<hi>Clergies Temporalities,</hi> saying, they were grown
to that excess of <hi>Pride,</hi> that it would be a <hi>Work</hi>
of <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> to clip their <hi>Wings,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
them to an <hi>Humility</hi> suitable to their <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession.</hi>
The <hi>Clergy</hi> at this were not a little <hi>Alarm'd,</hi>
and to prevent the worst, make a voluntary offer
of a <hi>Tenth</hi> to the King, and so the Dispute is
rock'd to sleep.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:99794:40"/>
Also during this <hi>Parliament,</hi> the King Confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
several <hi>Honours,</hi> Creating his Uncle <hi>Thomas</hi>
of <hi>Woodstock</hi> (who before was Earl of <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham)</hi>
Duke of <hi>Gloucester,</hi> and his other Uncle
<hi>Edmund</hi> of <hi>Langley</hi> (before the Earl of <hi>Cambridge)</hi>
Duke of <hi>York:</hi> With whom too he prefer'd his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
Favorites, as <hi>Robert de Vere</hi> Earl of <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
to be <hi>Marquess</hi> of <hi>Dublin</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> (the
first man within the Realm that was Enobled with
that Title; and Sir <hi>Michael de la Pole</hi> (the Son
of a Merchant in <hi>London)</hi> was made Earl of <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk,</hi>
and Lord Chancelor of <hi>England.</hi> But these
last grew in Hatred faster then they did in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour;
the <hi>Ancient Nobility</hi> disdainfully resenting
their undeserved (as they deemed) Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Nor were the People better satisfied, but
grumbled heavily, for they durst not speak out
against these <hi>Court Ear-wigs,</hi> as Seducers of the
King, and occasion of all misadministrations of
Affairs.</p>
            <p>In this <hi>Parliament</hi> likewise, the Duke of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caster</hi>
desired <hi>Leave</hi> of the <hi>King Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi>
to go into <hi>Spain</hi> to recover that Kingdom
belonging to him in the Right of his Wife; which
was granted, and Forty thousand Marks promised
him for his aid therein; and accordingly on <hi>Easter-Day</hi>
he came to take his <hi>Leave</hi> of their <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties:</hi>
The King commanding that he should be

<hi>That the frequency of granting such Pardons

framed a <hi>wonderful Wall of Wood,</hi> three Miles in

of <hi>Calice,</hi> took three of their Ships laden with

caused to be set up about <hi>Whinchelsea,</hi> for securing
that Town; and also he took another Ship full of
Guns, Gunpowder, and other Instruments of
War: With which Losses, and especialy by the

so excessively he doted on him; <hi>Non sina nota (utfertur)

            </p>
            <p>On <hi>Monday</hi> the morrow after the Feast of S <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom,</hi>
the <hi>King</hi> held a <hi>Parliament</hi> at <hi>Westminister,</hi>
which ended on the Feast of S. <hi>Andrew;</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:99794:42"/>
whereof <hi>Henry Knyghton</hi> (who lived at
that very time) Relates as follows:</p>
            <q>
               <p>[P. 2680.] The King (saith he) for the most
part staid lingering at <hi>Eltham</hi> whilest the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
sate; the nobles therefore of the Realm,
and the Commons with joynt Assent, sent this
Message to the King; <hi>That the Chancelor and
Treasurer ought to be removed from their Offices,
because they were not for the good of the King and
Kingdom, and because also they had such matters
to treat of with</hi> Michael de Pole, <hi>as could not be
treated of whilest he remain'd in the Office of Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor.</hi>
The King hereat incensed, return'd his
Command, <hi>That they should mention no more those
things, but that they should proceed to the Business
of</hi> Parliament, <hi>aud hasten to a conclusion;</hi> adding,
<hi>That he would not for them, or at their instance, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
the meanest Scullion boy in his Kitchin out of
his place.</hi> For the Chancelor in the Name of the
<hi>King,</hi> had desired of the <hi>Commons</hi> Four Fifteenths
to be paid in one year, and as many Tenths from
the <hi>Clergy;</hi> alledging that the King was so
much in debt, that he could not otherwise be
freed from his Debts and other Burdens lying
upon him, as well upon the account of war, as
of his Houshold and other Charges; But they
by joynt Assent of <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons,</hi> returned
this Answer to the King; <hi>That they neiher could,
nor by any means would proceed in any Business of
Parliament nor dispatch somuch as the least Article,
till the King should come and shew himself in his own
Person amongst them, and remove the said</hi> Michael
de Pole <hi>from his office.</hi> Upon which the King
sent back this Command to them, <hi>That they
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:99794:42"/>
should order Forty Knights of the most substantial
and wisest of the Commons to come unto him, and
declare the Votes of all the rest.</hi> But then were
they more afraid, every man for his own safety:
For a secret Rumor had privately come to their
Ears, That the death of these Forty was design'd
by Treachery. For it was said, <hi>as appeared after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
unto them,</hi> That as these should be going
to speak with the King, a multitude of Armed
Men should <hi>set upon and murther them:</hi> Or that
being invited to a Feast by the King, some Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Ruffians should rush in upon them and kill
them, or that they should be murther'd in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
in their <hi>Lodgings</hi> in <hi>London.</hi> But <hi>Nieolas
de Exon</hi> Mayor of that City refusing, and by no
meanes consenting to so great a <hi>wickedness</hi> the
Villany was deferr'd, and the cursed Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
by degrees brought to light. Making use
therefore of wholsom Advice, they by common
consent of the whole <hi>Parliament,</hi> sent the Lord
<hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Woodstock,</hi> Duke of <hi>Glocester,</hi> and
<hi>Thomas de Arundel</hi> Bishop of <hi>Ely,</hi> to the King at
<hi>Eltham,</hi> That they should on the behalf of the
Lords and Commons of his <hi>Parliament,</hi> Salute
him, and deliver their Votes or desires to him,
under such a Form or Sense of words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir King!</hi> The Prelates Lords, and whole Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

or Errors are to be redress'd; where, with the
most prudent Councill, the state and Goverment of
the Kingdom is to be treated of: That the King and
Nations Foes within, and their Enemies abroad, may
be discovered, and repulsed by such means as most
conveniently and honourably it may be done; and
also with wholsom deliberation therein to fore see and
order how the necessary Burdens of the King and

since they are to support publick Charges incumbent,
they should have the Supervisal too how and by whom

moreover, that this is their Priviledge by ancient

That then from that time it shall be or is
lawfull for all and every of them, without any da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
from the King, to go home, and every one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
into his own Country. And <hi>Now,</hi> You for a
longer time have absented <hi>Your Self,</hi> and for what
Cause they know not, have refus'd to come amonst

            <p>To this, the King.</p>
            <q>
               <p>Now do We plainly discover, that our
People and the Commons intend to
resist, and are endeavouring to make In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrections
against us; and in such case
nothing seems better to us, than to [call
in] our Kinsman the King of <hi>France,</hi> and
from him to ask Advice and Aid; nay
even to submit Our Self to him, rather
than to Truckle to our own Subjects.</p>
            </q>
            <p>To which they answered thus.</p>
            <q>
               <p>THis Council is not sase for You, but rather
tends to inevitable destruction; For the King
of <hi>France</hi> is your Capital Enemy, and the much
greatest Adversary to your Kingdom, and if be
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:99794:44"/>
should once get footing on your Land, would sooner
endeavour to dispoil you of it, to invade your King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and to drive you from your Throne, than
in the lest to lend you his assisting hand, if at any
time (which God forbid) you should stand in need
thereof: Rather therefore recall to your Memory
how your Grandfather King <hi>Edward the Third,</hi>
and in like manner your Father, a Prince of the
same Name and Renown, with Sweat and Hazards
during their whole Lives, through innumerable La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors
indefatigably contended for the conquest of the
Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> which by hereditary Right ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertained
to them, and after them to you by Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
Remember, how many of the Nobles, what
innumerable Troops of the Commons of <hi>England,</hi> as
well as those of <hi>France</hi> lost their Lives, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went
the peril of Death in that Quarrel: Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
the inestimable Treasures the People of <hi>England</hi>
freely parted with for the maintanance of that War.</p>
               <p>And yet what is more to be lamented, they have
in your time sustained so many <hi>Taxes</hi> for the support
of your Wars, as that now they are reduced to such
incredible Poverty, that they can neither pay their
<hi>Rents</hi> for their <hi>Livings,</hi> nor assist their <hi>King,</hi> nor
afford themselves even the <hi>Necessaries</hi> of <hi>Life.</hi> Thus
The <hi>Royal Power</hi> is impoverished, and an unhappy
condition brought upon all Great Men and Nobles
of the Kingdom, as well as the Commons weakned and
undone; <hi>For a King cannot be poor that has a rich
People nor that King be rich whose Subjects are
Poor.</hi> Nor do these <hi>Ills</hi> redound alone to the King, but
to all the Nobility and Great Men, every one in his
Rank and degree. And all this is brought to pass by
the <hi>evil Ministers</hi> of the King, who have ill-Governed
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:99794:44"/>
both <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Kingdom</hi> to this day; and unless we
do quickly set our helping hands to the Work and raise
the healing Prop, the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> will in
less time then we think of, be miserably subverted.</p>
               <p>But there is yet one part more of our
Message remaining on the behalf of your
People to be imparted to you, <hi>That</hi> we
have an ancient Constitution, and it was
not many Ages since experimented; it
grieves us that we must mention it, That
if the King through any evil Council
whatever, or through a weak Obstinacy
or Contempt of his People, a perverse fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Will or irregular Course, shall alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
himself from his People, and refuse to
Govern by the Laws and Statutes of the
Realm, by the laudable Ordinances and
and faithful Advice, If he shall throw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
headlong into wild Designs, and stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornly
exercise his own singular Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Will; That from that time it shall be
lawful for his People by their full and
free Assent and Consent, to Depose that
King from his Throne, and to establish
some other of the Royal Stock upon the
same in his stead. Which grievous and
unhappy Dissention, That it may never
spring up amongst your People; That

and above all the Nations in the
World, from your Fathers days hitherto,
most famious in War, may not now in

That the Title and Inscription of these
Miseries may never be placed as a scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous

Councils; and whatsoever they are
that suggest such matters to you, do not

                        <p>

Lord the King, Lands, Tenements, and

<hi>Chancellor</hi> at the time of such <hi>Purchase</hi>
made, did cause the said Lands and Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to be Extended at a much <hi>smaller
value</hi> than really they were worth by the

                        <p>And for that he purchased the said Lands

                        <p>2. <hi>Item,</hi> Whereas Nine Lords were As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed

            <p>
               <hi>WAlsingham</hi> tells us, That all these <hi>Articles</hi>
were so fully <hi>proved,</hi> that <hi>de Pole</hi> could
not deny them; insomuch that when he stood upon
his Answer, and had nothing to say for himself,
the King Blushing for him, shook his Head, and
said, <hi>Alas! alas,</hi> Michael, <hi>see what thou hast done!</hi>
And when the King desired a Supply, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
answered, <hi>That he did not need the Tallage of
his Subjects, who might so easily furnish himself of
so great a sum of Money, from him who was his just
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:99794:48"/>
Debtor.</hi> But at last, upon his Majesties yielding to
have him turn'd out of the <hi>Chancellorship,</hi> and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
the <hi>Articles,</hi> (which he was very unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to suffer) they freely gave him <hi>half a Tenth,
and half a Fifteenth;</hi> only providing, that it might
be necessarily Expended: To which purpose it
was to be deposited in the hands of the Earl of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rundel,</hi>
who was then going to Sea with a Fleet,
to secure the Coasts.</p>
            <p>They likewise gave the <hi>King</hi> on every Pipe of
Wine Imported or Exported, Three shillings; and
on every Twenty shillings worth of all sorts of
Merchandize Foreign or Domestick, brought in or
carried out, one shilling; Wool, Hides, and Pelts,
onely excepted. And also at the <hi>King's</hi> Instance
granted, that the Heirs of <hi>Charles de Bloys</hi> should
for <hi>Thirty thousand Marks</hi> be permitted to sell <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taigne</hi>
in <hi>France</hi> to the <hi>French,</hi> and that <hi>Robert de
Vere</hi> the new Duke of <hi>Ireland,</hi> the <hi>Kings</hi> most dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
Favourite, should have the said <hi>Thirty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Marks,</hi> (a prodigious sum of Money in those
days) wholly to his own use; provided he would
be gone before next <hi>Easter</hi> into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and there
make use of it to recover the Dominions that the
<hi>King</hi> hath given him in that Kingdom: so pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionately
did both Lords and Commons desire his
<hi>Absence,</hi> that they would rather want so much
Treasure, than have him here to Seduce and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatuate
the King. As for <hi>Michael Pole,</hi> he was
committed to <hi>Windsor</hi>-castle.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, the <hi>Parliament</hi> observing that
by the Covetousness of the <hi>King's Ministers,</hi> the
publick Revenue was <hi>vainly consumed,</hi> the <hi>King</hi>
insufferably <hi>defrauded</hi> and <hi>abused,</hi> the Common
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:99794:48"/>
People of the Realm by continual and grievous
Burdens miserably impoverished, the Rents and
Profits of the Nobles and Great Men much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired,
and their poor Tenants in many places
forc'd to abandon their <hi>Husbandry,</hi> and leave their
Farms empty and desolate: And yet still by all
these things the Kings Officers only becoming un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>measurably
<hi>Rich;</hi> They therefore chose Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
Lords of the Realm, and gave them leave
and power to Inquire into, Treat of, and Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
all Affairs, Causes, and Complaints arising
from the Death of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, to
that present time: As also of the King's Expences
and his Ministers, and all other matters whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
happening within the time to them Assigned;
and caused the said Lords so chosen to be <hi>sworn</hi>
on the <hi>Holy Evangelists,</hi> well and truly to regulate
all Burdens and other Affairs incumbent on the
King and Kingdom, and to <hi>do Justice</hi> to every
one requiring the same, according to the Grace
and Understanding given them by God. And
also the <hi>King took an Oath</hi> to stand to their <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi>
and to encourage them in their <hi>Actings,</hi>
and <hi>not to revoke any Article of their Power,</hi> but to
confirm and hold good and stable whatsoever the
said Counsellors should do or order during such
time; of whom Six, with the Three Officers of
the King appointed by consent of <hi>Parliament,</hi> viz.
The <hi>Chancellor,</hi> the <hi>Treasurer,</hi> and the <hi>Lord
Privy Seal,</hi> should at any time make a <hi>Quorum.</hi>
And it was also <hi>Ordained by Act of Parliament,</hi>
That if any one should Advise the <hi>King</hi> to make
any <hi>Revocation</hi> of their Power, though the <hi>King</hi>
should not <hi>Revoke</hi> it, yet the Person probably
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:99794:49"/>
Convicted only of such ill Counsel, should for the
same forfeit all his Lands and Goods; and if he
attempt it a second time, be drawn and hang'd
as a Traytor.</p>
            <p>Whereupon the King issued forth his <hi>Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi>
under the <hi>Great Seal of England,</hi> Confirming
the said Lords in such power, in the words follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;

               <hi>BUT notwithstanding all these</hi> Provisions, <hi>no
sooner was the</hi> Parliament <hi>Dissolv'd, but the</hi>
King <hi>look'd upon all they had done to be</hi> Dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<hi>likewise; or at least</hi> De facto <hi>he esteem'd as
nothing all their Complaints against</hi> de Pole, <hi>the
Duke of</hi> Ireland, <hi>the Archbishop of</hi> York, <hi>and
the rest; for he soon received them into</hi> greater
Favour and Confidence <hi>(if it might be) than ever
before: Who being full of</hi> Revenge <hi>themselves,
were not wanting to blow their</hi> Poyson <hi>into his
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:99794:52"/>
Royal Breast; for thus their fatal Whispers and
Suggestions are exprest by</hi> Trussel, <hi>in his</hi> Continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Daniel's</hi> History of <hi>England,</hi> Fol. 9.—<q>These
Triumvirs <hi>(saith he)</hi> incensed the King a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Nobles that were best deserving, partly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Disgraces desertfully done unto them; partly upon
malicious Emulation to see others so generally Belov'd,
(except of the King) and themselves so Contemptible.
And that their private Spleen might carry some shew
of Publick Respect, they suggested to the King, he
was but half, yea, not half a King: For <hi>(said they)</hi>
If we respect matters of State, you bear the <hi>Sword,</hi>
but they <hi>sway</hi> it; you have the <hi>Shew,</hi> but they
have the <hi>Authority</hi> of a <hi>Prince;</hi> using your Name as
a colourable Pretext to their Proceedings, and your
Person as a <hi>Cypher</hi> to make their Number the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
by the Addition thereof, without which they could
be nothing; neither are you any thing <hi>more</hi> by being
so placed. Look to the Duty of your <hi>Subjects,</hi>
and you shall finde it is at their Devotion: For you
cannot <hi>Command</hi> nor <hi>Demand,</hi> but with such Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitations
and Exceptions as they please to propose.
And for your private Actions, your Bounty (the
most to be Celebrated Vertue in a Prince) is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained,
your Expences measured, and your Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
confined, to Frown or Favour, as they shall
please to prescribe you. What <hi>Ward</hi> is so much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Government of his <hi>Guardian?</hi> Wherein will, or
can they more abridge you, except they should take
from you the Place, as they have done the Power of a
Prince? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus these <hi>Scycophants</hi> whisper'd their <hi>venomous
Suggestions</hi> to <hi>exasperate</hi> the <hi>King</hi> against his best
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:99794:52"/>
Subjects, whose <hi>Youth</hi> and <hi>Weakness</hi> rendred him
too much disposed for such Impressions, and fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
his conscious Mind to a full but <hi>needless fear.</hi>
He was much incensed at the Removal of his <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor</hi>
and <hi>Treasurer</hi> out of their <hi>Offices,</hi> and that
the Duke of <hi>Ireland</hi> (rather than part with whom
he would hazard All) must go out of the <hi>Realm;</hi>
supposing it a Restraint to his <hi>Regal Authority,</hi> not
to have <hi>Absolute Power</hi> in all things, to <hi>give</hi> and
<hi>forgive</hi> at his pleasure.</p>
            <p>Now when these private Incendiaries perceived
the King's Humour once <hi>sharpned,</hi> they so ply'd
him with plausible perswasions, that (though
naturally he was not of any <hi>cruel Disposition)</hi> yet
they drew him into many <hi>violent</hi> and <hi>indirect cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
partly through <hi>negligence</hi> to search out the
Truth, partly through delight to be flattered,
and a vain resolute humour to support those be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
<hi>Reason,</hi> whom he had Advanced without
<hi>Merit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the beginning of <hi>March,</hi> 1387. the Earls of
<hi>Arundel</hi> and <hi>Nottingham</hi> (pursuant to the <hi>Order</hi>
of the late <hi>Parliament)</hi> put to Sea with a Fleet,
which they manag'd with such Courage and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
that before <hi>Midsummer-day</hi> (besides other
famous Exploits) they had taken about One hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and sixty <hi>French Ships</hi> richly laden: But the
<hi>Court-Ear-wigs,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the rest,
enviously <hi>misrepresented</hi> all their <hi>Services</hi> unto the
King, whispering, That they had onely undone a
few Merchants, which it would have been more
for our Honour and Interest to have let alone; so
that at their Return, instead of <hi>Respect</hi> and <hi>Thanks,</hi>
the King (whose equal <hi>unhappiness</hi> it was to grace
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:99794:53"/>
               <hi>undeserving men,</hi> and <hi>disgrace</hi> the <hi>deserving)</hi> lookt
upon them but <hi>ill;</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Ireland</hi> would
not look upon them at all: Whereupon the Earls
in <hi>discontent</hi> retir'd from Court to their own
Country-houses.</p>
            <p>And still more to exasperate both Nobles and
People, the said Duke of <hi>Ireland</hi> would now
needs be divorced from his Wife <hi>Philippa</hi> (Grand-daughter
to King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, by his
Daughter <hi>Isabel</hi> and the Arch-Duke of <hi>Austria)</hi>
a Lady of sufficient Beauty, and irreproachable
Vertue; and in her stead preferred to his Bed one
<hi>Lancerona,</hi> a mean <hi>Bohemian</hi> that waited on the
Queen, Daughter (some say) of a <hi>Vintner,</hi> or (as
others will have it) of a <hi>Joyner.</hi> The King took no
notice of this Affront offered to his <hi>Cousin-german,</hi>
but the Duke of <hi>Gloucester</hi> her Uncle. resented it
highly, and waited for an opportunity to Revenge
it; which the other well perceived, and was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to <hi>strike first. Easter</hi> was now come and
past, the time limitted by <hi>Parliament</hi> for the Duke
of <hi>Ireland</hi>'s being <hi>gone;</hi> but he (though so large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hired to it as aforesaid) cared not for that
<hi>Voyage;</hi> Onely to <hi>wheadle</hi> the People, the King
went down with him into <hi>Wales,</hi> on pretence of
seeing him take <hi>Shipping,</hi> but in truth, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there remote, they might more securely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
how to circumvent and destroy the Duke of
<hi>Gloucester,</hi> the Earls of <hi>Arundel, Warwick, Derby,
Nottingham,</hi> and other faithful Subjects of the
Kingdom: For there were with the King, <hi>Michael
de la Pole, Tresylian</hi> the Chief Justice, and many
others that were conscious of their own Deserts,
and feared to be brought to Justice, as well as the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:99794:53"/>
said Duke of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and therefore readily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired
with him against the Lords. Having thus
laid their Plot, and agreed the manner of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
it in execution, back comes the King to <hi>Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingham,</hi>
and as if <hi>Ireland</hi>'s Voyage had been <hi>quite
forgot,</hi> brings him and the rest of the <hi>Cabal</hi> with
him. Thither they summon divers <hi>Citizens</hi> of
<hi>London,</hi> the <hi>Sheriffs</hi> of the several Counties, and
all the <hi>Judges</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> The <hi>Londoners,</hi> because
several of them having lately confessed themselves
guilty of Treason, had been <hi>pardoned</hi> by the
King, were call'd; that in return of that Favour,
they might <hi>accuse</hi> the Lords of such Crimes as the
King with his Counsellors in <hi>Wales</hi> and <hi>contrived
against them.</hi> The <hi>Sheriffs</hi> were advised with,
what <hi>Forces</hi> they could raise for the Kings Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
against the Barons; and also commanded, that
they should not permit any to be returned as
<hi>Knights of the Shire,</hi> or <hi>Burgesses for the next Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
but such as the King and his Council should
direct, or nominate:</hi> To which the Sheriffs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd,
That the Commons generally favoured the
said Lords, so that it was not in their power to
raise an Army in this Case; and as <hi>for Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-men,
the People would hold their ancient Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms,</hi>
which require that they be <hi>freely chosen by
the Commons:</hi> Nor could the same be hindered.
These Answers were not very agreeable to the
Court-designes. But the <hi>Judges</hi> were more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliant;
for not onely <hi>Tresylian</hi> the <hi>Chief Justice</hi>
had about the same time <hi>indicted two thousand per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi>
at <hi>Coventry,</hi> and he and <hi>John Blake</hi> an <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentice
of the Law,</hi> perused and approved under
their Seals, the <hi>Indictment</hi> against the Lords; but
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:99794:54"/>
also the better to colour Proceedings with a Form
of Law, several <hi>Questions</hi> were propounded to
them touching the late <hi>Act of Parliament,</hi> giving
the fourteen Lords power to inspect and punish
miscarriages of the Kings Ministers
as aforesaid: To the end (as<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Sir</hi> W. Ch. p. 247.</note> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
Author observes) <hi>That what the
Duke of</hi> Ireland <hi>and the rest thought
fit, might pass for Law out of the Judges mouths; the
Questions being so fram'd and propos'd, as it was ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier
to understand what the King would have to be
Law, than what in truth was so.</hi> For it seems they
proceeded against their Consciences, in that se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
of them, and particularly <hi>Belknapp</hi> Chief Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
of the <hi>Common Pleas,</hi> did (as <hi>Knyghton,
Col.</hi> 2694. assures us) very earnestly refuse to
signe the <hi>Resolutions,</hi> till <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>de Pole</hi> forced
him to it, by threatning him <hi>to kill him</hi> if he refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed:
Whereupon having put to his Seal, he burst
forth into these words before them,—<hi>Now want
I nothing but a Ship, or a nimble Horse, or an Halter
to bring me to that death I deserve: If I had not done
this, I should have been kill'd by your hands; and now
I have gratified the Kings pleasure and yours in doing
it, I have well deserv'd to die for Treason against the
Nobles of the Land.</hi>—Which last words were like
to have prov'd fatally Prophetick; for not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in the next <hi>Parliament</hi> he was indeed condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to die, though not executed for the same.
Some Authors say, That <hi>all the Judges</hi> of <hi>England,</hi>
(except <hi>William Skipwith</hi> absent by reason of sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness)
joyn'd in answering these Questions; which
seems probable, because they were afterwards all
question'd and punish'd for the same: yet in the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:99794:54"/>
               <hi>Record</hi> there are but five named; possibly the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
might consent, though only these set their
Seals to it.</p>

made and published in the last Parliament held at
<hi>Westminster,</hi> be not derogatory to the <hi>Royalty</hi> and

                        <p>To which they unanimously answered, That the

same <hi>are derogatory</hi> thereunto, especially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they were against his <hi>will.</hi>

who <hi>moved the</hi> King to consent to the making of the
said Statute?</p>
                        <p>Whereunto they answered with one accord, That

                        <p>To which Question they unanimously answered, That
they are to be punished as Traytors.</p>
                        <p>6. <hi>Quaery</hi> of them, Whether after in a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
assembled, the Affairs of the Kingdom, and
the cause of calling that Parliament, are by the Kings
Command <hi>declared,</hi> and certain Articles limited by
the King, upon which the Lords and Commons in

Lords and Commons will proceed altogether upon <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

shall have first answered them upon the Articles and

the Kings <hi>Command</hi> be to the contrary; <hi>whether</hi> in
such case the King ought not to have the Governance
of the Parliament, and effectually <hi>over-rule</hi> them,
so as that they ought to proceed <hi>first</hi> on the Matters

Lords and Commons ought first to have the Kings An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
upon their Proposals before they proceeded fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</p>
                        <p>To which Question they answered unanimously,
that the King in that behalf his the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
and may appoint what shall be <hi>first hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,</hi>
and so gradually what next in all Matters
to be treated of in <hi>Parliament,</hi> even to the end

the Lords and Commons to depart from thence, or
not.</p>
                        <p>To which they unanimously answered, That he can;

justifie or punish them for their Offences; Whether
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:99794:56"/>

                        <p>9. <hi>Quaery</hi> of them, How he is to be punisht who
moved in <hi>Parliament,</hi> that the <hi>Statute</hi> should be sent
for, whereby <hi>Edward</hi> the Second (the Kings great
Grandfather) was proceeded against and deposed in
<hi>Parliament;</hi> by means of sending for and imposing
which <hi>Statute,</hi> the said late <hi>Statute, Ordination,</hi>
and <hi>Commission,</hi> were <hi>devised</hi> and brought forth in
<hi>Parliament.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To which they answered, That as well he that so
<hi>moved,</hi> as he who by pretence of that <hi>Motion</hi>
carried the said <hi>Statute</hi> to the <hi>Parliament,</hi> are
<hi>Traytors</hi> and <hi>Criminals</hi> to be punished with
Death.</p>
                        <p>10. It was demanded of them, Whether the <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
given in the last <hi>Parliament</hi> held at <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi>
against <hi>Michael de Pole</hi> Earl of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> was
<hi>Erroneous</hi> and <hi>Revocable,</hi> or not.</p>
                        <p>To which <hi>Question</hi> they unanimously answered,
That if that <hi>Judgment</hi> were now to be given,
they would not give it; because it seems to them,
that the said <hi>Judgment</hi> is <hi>Revocable,</hi> as being
<hi>Erroneous</hi> in <hi>every part</hi> of it.</p>
                        <p>In Testimony of all which, the Judges and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant
aforesaid, to these <hi>Presents</hi> have put their <hi>Scals,</hi>
in the presence of the Reverend Lords, <hi>Alexander</hi>

Archbishop of <hi>York, Robert</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Dublin,

and <hi>John</hi> Bishop of <hi>Bangor, Robert</hi> Duke of
<hi>Ireland, Michael</hi> Earl of <hi>Suffolk, John Rypon</hi>
Clerk, and <hi>John Blake</hi> Esquire: <hi>Given the

            </q>
            <p>But though they had thus resolv'd the <hi>Law</hi> to
their Minds, there was a greater Difficulty how
to arm themselves with <hi>Power</hi> enough for <hi>Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
In order to which, they privately sent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
to <hi>Levy Men,</hi> but found them come in very
<hi>slowly,</hi> because the Lords were generally <hi>beloved,</hi>
and these Favourites of the King equally <hi>hated.</hi>
Nor could they manage their Designs with such <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy,</hi>
but the Lords had notice; whereupon, to
take off all ill Impressions made against them in the
Kings Mind, his Uncle the Duke of <hi>Gloucester</hi>
(chief of the Lords against whom the Courtiers
had combin'd) voluntarily before the Bishop of
<hi>London,</hi> and many Nobles of the Realm, did make
Oath, <hi>That he had never imagined any thing to the
prejudice of the King, but had studied and performed
to his power, what tended to the Kings Honour and
Advantage, and what also was well pleasing to him;
except only that he could not kindly regard the Duke
of</hi> Ireland, <hi>whom the King immoderately lov'd, and
who had dishonoured one that was not only a near Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of him the said Duke of</hi> Gloucester, <hi>but also
of the King's, which it was fit should be reveng'd,</hi>
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>With the Contents of which Oath, the Bishop
acquainted the King, who seem'd inclinable to
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:99794:57"/>
credit the same; till <hi>Michael de Pole</hi> began to
exasperate him against the Duke: To whom the
Bishop smartly reply'd,—<hi>Be silent, Sir, it becomes
not you to talk, who stand condemned in Parliament,
and are now alive only by the Kings Grace and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</hi>
Which so offended the King, that he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the Bishop out of his presence, bidding him
be gon home <hi>to his Church;</hi> who at his return in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
the Duke what had pass'd, and how much
the King was <hi>sway'd</hi> by those wicked Councellors:
So that it was high time for him to <hi>provide</hi> for his
own safety, and obviate that destruction which
was prepared for him.</p>
            <p>Hereupon the Duke of <hi>Gloucester,</hi> with the Earls
of <hi>Arundel, Warwick,</hi> and <hi>Derby,</hi> (who were all
designed to the same Condemnation, if not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented)
advising together, resolve to stand upon
their <hi>Guard,</hi> and Treat with the King concerning
the premisses, and that favour which he afforded
to them, who were <hi>Traytors</hi> both to him and the
publick, and the <hi>imminent hazard</hi> of the Kingdom
thence arising. The King endeavoured to have
surprized them <hi>singly,</hi> before they had united their
Retinues, but failed therein; so that with a very
considerable force they assembled together at <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryngey-Park.</hi>
The King was just then preparing
(as it was said) for a Journey to <hi>Canterbury,</hi> to
pay, as was pretended, his Devotions at the <hi>Shrine</hi>
of S. <hi>Thomas Becket,</hi> but indeed from thence to
have pass'd into <hi>France,</hi> and delivered up to the
<hi>French</hi> King <hi>Calice,</hi> and several other important
Places, which by the <hi>fatal Counsel</hi> of his <hi>pernicious
Flatterers,</hi> he had sold unto that King. But this
News of the Lords being in Arms, diverted that
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:99794:57"/>
               <hi>Voyage,</hi> and put King <hi>Richard</hi> into great Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
not knowing what measures to take: Some
of those about him were for <hi>reconciling</hi> the
Lords with <hi>fair promises;</hi> others were for raising
the <hi>Londoners,</hi> and what other <hi>Forces</hi> could be
procured, and <hi>fighting</hi> them; of which opinion
especially was the Bishop of <hi>York:</hi> But this the
more prudent <hi>disapproved,</hi> alledging the Disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and Damage would accrue to the King if
worsted.</p>
            <p>Whilst these <hi>wise men</hi> could not agree what
course to take, there was a <hi>Fool</hi> stumbled on an
<hi>Expression,</hi> which if duly considered, might have
done the King more <hi>Service</hi> than all their <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates:</hi>
This was a certain Knight called <hi>Hugh de
Lynne,</hi> who had been bred in the Wars, but by
an accident lost his Understanding, and now as a
<hi>Natural</hi> was maintained by the Charity of several
of the Nobles and Retainers to the Court: The
King meeting him during these Consultations, and
being willing to divert himself by hearing his foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
discourse, askt him jocularly, <hi>What he should
do with the Lords that were Assembled together in the
before-mentioned Park.</hi> To which the said <hi>Hugh</hi>
very melancholy answered,—<hi>March forth, Sir!
and let us fall upon them, and kill every Mothers Son
of them: which being done, by God's Eye you will gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantly
have destroyed all the faithful Subjects you
have in your Kingdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time, <hi>Mediators</hi> for Peace posting
to and fro between the King and the Lords; it
was at last by their Intercession concluded, that
the Lords should come before the King at <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster,</hi>
and receive the Kings Answer to their
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:99794:58"/>
Grievances: The Bishop of <hi>Ely</hi> and divers other
persons of Honour and Credit, giving their Oaths
on the Kings behalf, <hi>That no Treachery or ill pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
should be used, but that they might come and go
with safety; and if any were designed, that they
would admonish them of it.</hi> A Caution that in the
Event proved not <hi>unnecessary:</hi> For on the day they
should appear, they had Intelligence that there
was an <hi>Ambuscade</hi> laid for them about the <hi>Mews;</hi>
whereupon they delayed their coming; and the
King (who had waited an hour or two for them
beyond the time appointed) enquiring the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
was told by the said Bishop of <hi>Ely,</hi> that it
was because he did not keep his word, for there
was secretly planted above a thousand Armed
Men to <hi>cut them off</hi> in their passage. The King
seemed much offended at this Treachery, and
swore that he was not <hi>privy</hi> to it, and therefore
commanded the Sheriffs of <hi>London</hi> to search the
<hi>Mews;</hi> and if they found any persons assembled
there for such a purpose, to <hi>kill</hi> them. But in
truth, the <hi>Contrivance</hi> was not there, but in a
place at <hi>Westminster,</hi> where Sir <hi>Thomas Trivet</hi> and
Sir <hi>Nicholas Bramber</hi> had to this intent got toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
great numbers of their Faction in Arms,
whom upon this discovery they dismist, and reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
into <hi>London.</hi> And now the King promising
again <hi>safe Conduct</hi> to the Lords, they soon after
arrived in his Royal presence, whom they found
in <hi>Westminster-Hall</hi> in his Robes of State, and with
his <hi>Crown</hi> on his <hi>Head,</hi> and <hi>Scepter</hi> in his hand;
To whom they presented themselves on their
<hi>Knees;</hi> and the Bishop of <hi>Ely</hi> Lord Chancellor on
the Kings behalf made a Speech, blaming them for
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:99794:58"/>
their raising Forces, and demanding the Cause;
withal, recommending the Kings <hi>Goodness,</hi> who
chose thus graciously to Treat with them, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than to <hi>Chastise</hi> them by <hi>Arms;</hi> which he
told them his Majesty wanted not <hi>power</hi> easily to
have done.</p>
            <p>To this the Lords answered, That they had As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled
together for the <hi>good of the King and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and to remove Traytors from the King:</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
particularly <hi>Robert de Vere</hi> Duke of <hi>Ireland,
Alexander Nevil</hi> Archbishop of <hi>York, Michael
de Pole</hi> Earl of <hi>Suffolk, Robert Tresylian</hi> the false
Chief Justice, and <hi>Nicholas Bramber</hi> the false Knight
of <hi>London;</hi> whom they <hi>averr'd to be Traitors,</hi> and
(flinging down their Gloves) that they were
ready to <hi>prove them to be such by Battle;</hi> [a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Tryal not unusual in those times.] To
which the King himself answered, <hi>That it shall not
be determined in that manner, but in the next Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi>
which We appoint to be the Morrow
after the <hi>Purification of the blessed Virgin</hi> next;
where both Parties coming, should have Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
done according to Law: And in the mean
time all of them to be in the Kings protection,
without injuring one another.—And so after
some friendly Discourse, and <hi>Drinking</hi> with the
King, they departed thence. And two days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
the King (the more to appease the Lords,
and satisfie the people) caused <hi>Proclamation</hi> to
be made in <hi>London,</hi> seeming in Excuse of the
Duke of <hi>Gloucester</hi> and his Associates, but indeed
to amuse them, and preserve his dear <hi>Favourites</hi>
from threatned <hi>Violence;</hi> the Tenour whereof
was to this effect.</p>

            <p>But for all these <hi>fair words,</hi> the Popular Lords
knowing the Kings <hi>Mutability,</hi> and as well the
<hi>Influence</hi> those his ill Counsellors had over him, as
their malice and perfidiousness, thought it the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
course not to <hi>separate</hi> themselves, but with a
vigilant Eye to observe the <hi>Motions</hi> of <hi>Affairs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Ireland</hi> and the rest accused, did
not appear with the King at this Meeting, and
'twas their wisest course to be absent; for 'tis be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
the Kings Presence would scarce have been
able to protect them: Nor had they any mind to
hazard themselves on the Justice of the next Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament;
but rather resolv'd, if they could, to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
themselves by Arms. To which purpose the
Duke of <hi>Ireland</hi> was all this while raising of Men
in <hi>Cheshire</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> either by the Kings <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission</hi>
or <hi>Connivance;</hi> and that it was more than
the <hi>latter,</hi> may justly be suspected, because when
he had made considerable Levies, the King com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<hi>Thomas Molineux,</hi> a man of great Courage
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:99794:60"/>
and Conduct, Constable of the Castle of <hi>Chester,</hi>
to <hi>accompany</hi> and <hi>safe conduct</hi> the said Duke with
all <hi>the Forces</hi> he could make, to his Majesties Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.
The Adverse Lords being <hi>Advertis'd</hi> of
these Preparations, and that they were upon their
<hi>March,</hi> beset the Ways by which the Duke should
pass to <hi>London,</hi> resolving to encounter him before
he should have encreas'd his <hi>Power,</hi> and <hi>counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanc'd</hi>

was lost on both sides, before the Duke (who

being disheartened, and Sir <hi>Thomas Molineux</hi> slain,
the Earl of <hi>Derby</hi> obtain'd a <hi>cheap,</hi> but <hi>intire</hi> Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory,
allay'd with nothing but the <hi>escape</hi> of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
who having mounted a <hi>fleet Nag,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to pass a River, cast away both Gauntlet and
Sword to be the <hi>lighter,</hi> and so <hi>swam</hi> over, and
got first into <hi>Holland;</hi> where finding but cold
Entertainment, he went to <hi>Vtrecht;</hi> and after
two or three years rambling up and down as a

<hi>War-horse</hi> and <hi>Armour</hi> being found on the Brink of
the River, raised a general Report that he was
<hi>Drown'd;</hi> which probably might facilitate his
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:99794:60"/>
escape. Amongst his Baggage was taken a very
considerable sum of <hi>Gold,</hi> and (what was of greater
value) <hi>the Kings Letters,</hi> ordering his present Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
to <hi>London,</hi> and promising <hi>to live and die with
him</hi> against all Opposers.</p>
            <p>But this <hi>Disaster</hi> Thunder-struck the whole <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal;</hi>
The Earl of <hi>Suffolk</hi> in disguise flies to <hi>Calice,</hi>
where his own <hi>Brother</hi> being Governour of the
Castle, refused to <hi>harbour</hi> him without the consent
of the Lord <hi>William Beauchamp</hi> Governour of the
Town, who return'd him back as a Prisoner into
<hi>England</hi> to the <hi>King:</hi> But the King not onely let
him go at <hi>large,</hi> but sent for over, and for some
time <hi>Committed</hi> the said <hi>Beauchamp</hi> for such his

his <hi>pleasure:</hi> for on the late Bargains and <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Intrigues</hi> with <hi>France,</hi> King <hi>Richard</hi> having
as aforesaid, sold <hi>Calice</hi> to the <hi>French</hi>
King,<note place="margin">Knyghton, Col. 2698.</note> sent a Knight with Letters un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his <hi>Privy-Signet,</hi> commanding
<hi>Beauchamp</hi> to deliver up the Town to him, and
one Sir <hi>John Golofre</hi> with other Letters to the
<hi>French</hi> King: but he knowing the vast <hi>Importance</hi>
of the place, and believing the King <hi>imposed</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by wicked Councel, resolutely answered, <hi>That
the Custody and Government of the Town was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to him in the Presence and by the Authority of
the King and the Nobles of the Realm openly and
publickly, and he would not surrender it in Hugger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mugger,
nor part with his Command but in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.</hi>
And also he took <hi>Golofre</hi>'s Letters to the
<hi>French</hi> King from him, and privately <hi>transmitted</hi>
them to the Duke of <hi>Gloucester.</hi> For which Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:99794:61"/>
fronts the King waited an opportunity to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veng'd,
and had proceeded 'tis thought more <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely,</hi>
but that the said <hi>Beauchamp</hi> was a person
extreamly beloved, and the King was not at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
in a condition to use rigours; and so by the
Mediation of Friends he was quickly discharg'd.</p>
            <p>The rest of the <hi>hated Faction,</hi> as the Archbishop
of <hi>York,</hi> Justice <hi>Tresylian,</hi> and others, ran every
man like Coneys to their <hi>Covert,</hi> and were not to
be heard of: Nay the <hi>King</hi> betook himself to the
<hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> and there made Provision for
his Winter-Quarters; all his Designes being fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated,
first by <hi>Rashness</hi> in taking Arms, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
by <hi>Cowardise</hi> in using them. And to
adde to his <hi>Confusion,</hi> about the same time an <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy</hi>
from the <hi>French</hi> King was taken with Letters,
whereby the <hi>French</hi> King Licens'd King <hi>Richard,</hi>
the Duke of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and some others, with Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants
to such a number, to come into <hi>Boloign,</hi>
where he would be ready to receive them with
great <hi>Pomp,</hi> and from them receive the <hi>Possession
of</hi> Calice, <hi>and other strong Holds;</hi> for which he
had (says <hi>Walsingham,</hi> fol. 332.) <hi>already paid
King</hi> Richard.</p>
            <p>The Lords therefore perceiving such consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Territories ready to be <hi>lost</hi> abroad, as well
as Extravagancies practised at home, hasten'd their

with an Army of Forty thousand men, they Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
on S. <hi>Stephen</hi>'s day; the Citizens furnishing
them with Victuals; and whether more out of
<hi>Fear</hi> or <hi>Love.</hi> I cannot say, offered to let them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:99794:61"/>
               <hi>personal Conference with the King,</hi> which at last he
granted; permitting them first to search the <hi>Tower,</hi>
to prevent any Surprize. The Duke and Earls then
waited upon him, and after a few <hi>cold Complements</hi>
laid before him, the Confederacy against their
<hi>Lives</hi> at <hi>Nottingham,</hi> his Letters to the Duke of
<hi>Ireland,</hi> contrary to his <hi>Royal Word,</hi> together
with his <hi>dishonourable Treaty to deliver up</hi> Calice
<hi>to the</hi> French King, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The King heard them
at first with <hi>silence</hi> and <hi>patience,</hi> and afterwards
with a dejected Countenance, and not without
some <hi>Tears,</hi> seemed to acknowledge that he could
neither <hi>deny</hi> or <hi>justifie</hi> what they complain'd of;
and certainly the Stomachs of the Lords must
needs more Relent to those <hi>luke-warm drops,</hi> than
they would to his greatest violence. So <hi>agreed it
was,</hi> that he would meet them next day at
<hi>Westminster,</hi> there to treat of these and other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
Affairs of the Realm. But no sooner were
they gone, but some Abusers of the <hi>Royal Ear</hi>
suggested, that his going thither would be nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Honourable nor safe, but bring both his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
into <hi>present danger</hi> and <hi>contempt,</hi> and occasion
a future Abridgment of his Authority: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the Kings Mind turned, and began to <hi>Retract</hi>
his promise. This heated the Lords so much,
that being <hi>flusht</hi> with opportunity and power,
they sent him peremptory word, <hi>That if he did
thus faulter with them, and would not appear to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
the good of the Realm, they would take other mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures:</hi>
Intimating no less than the <hi>Election of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</hi>
This so work'd upon the King, that he was
pleased to meet them, and to consent (though
not without some Reluctancy) that several of
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:99794:62"/>
his <hi>Minions</hi> should be banisht the Court; as <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi>

of several <hi>High Treasons</hi> by them committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

                        </p>
                        <p>And whereas shortly after, by the Assent of

have by many false Contrivances, by them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>Loyalty</hi> or <hi>Good Faith</hi> imagined and sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted,
endeavoured wholly to <hi>Ingross</hi> his Majesties

Affection, and to make him intirely give Faith

whereas the King ought to be of a <hi>free</hi> condition

Honour, Estate, and Royalty, contrary to their
Allegiance, and as Traytors unto him.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi>Item,</hi> The said Traytors, by the Assent and
Councel of <hi>Robert Tresylian</hi> the false Justice, and
<hi>Nicholas Brember</hi> the false Knight of <hi>London,</hi> by
their false Covin would not at all suffer the great
Persons of the Realm, nor the good Subjects of

to them, unless in the <hi>presence</hi> and hearing of them

the said Duke of <hi>Ireland,</hi> &amp;c. or two of them, at

they thought fit, to the great <hi>disgrace</hi> of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
and good Counsellors of the King, and to the
preventing of their good will and <hi>service</hi> towards
the King, thereby encroaching to themselves the
Royal power, and a Lordship and, Soveraignty o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the person of the King, to the great <hi>dishonour</hi>
and peril of the King, his Crown and Realm.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi>Item,</hi> The said Archbishop, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by such their
false devices and <hi>pernicious Councels,</hi> have diverted
the <hi>King</hi> from shewing <hi>due countenance</hi> to his great
Lords, and Liege People, so that they could not be
<hi>answered</hi> in their Suits and Rights, without the
<hi>leave</hi> of them the said Archbishop, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thereby
putting the King besides his <hi>Devoir,</hi> contrary to
his <hi>Oath,</hi> contriving to <hi>alienate</hi> the Heart of our
Lord the King from his <hi>People,</hi> that they might
engross amongst themselves only the Government
of the Realm; whereby they have caused our
Lord the King, without the Assent of the Realm,
or any <hi>desert</hi> in them, to have given away by their
Abetment many Lordships, Castles, Towns, and
Mannors, as well annexed to his Crown, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
As particularly the Land of <hi>Ireland</hi> and
<hi>Okam,</hi> with the Forest and Lands which did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to the Lord <hi>Dandelegh,</hi> and great quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of other Lands, to the said Duke of <hi>Ireland,</hi>
and divers others, whereby they unworthily are
<hi>vastly inriched,</hi> but the King rendred, <hi>poor,</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to sustain and defray the Charges of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi>
unless by <hi>Impositions,</hi> heavy <hi>Taxes</hi> and
<hi>Tributes</hi> laid upon his People, to the disinherison
of his Crown, and the destruction of the Realm.</p>

5. <hi>Item,</hi> By such Encroachment of the said
Archbishop, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and by the <hi>Counsel</hi> of that false
Justicer <hi>Tresylian,</hi> and <hi>Brember</hi> the false Knight
of <hi>London,</hi> they have caused our Lord the King
to have <hi>given away</hi> divers Mannors, Lands, Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nements,
Offices, and Bailywicks, to divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
persons their <hi>Creatures,</hi> and such as they
could <hi>confide</hi> in, and to others, of whom they
have taken great <hi>Gifts</hi> by way of <hi>Brokage</hi> for
that purpose, and to stand by them in their false
<hi>Suits</hi> and ill purposes, to the great prejudice of
the King and Realm, such as Sir <hi>Robert Mansel</hi>
Clerk, <hi>John Blake, Thomas Vsk,</hi> and divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
                        <p>6. <hi>Item,</hi> The said Duke, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Encroaching to
themselves the Royal Power, have caused the
King to give very great <hi>Gifts of Gold and Silver,</hi>
as well of his <hi>proper Goods</hi> and <hi>Jewels,</hi> as of the
<hi>Goods</hi> and <hi>Treasure</hi> of the <hi>Realm;</hi> as <hi>Tenths, Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teens,</hi>
and other <hi>Taxes</hi> granted by divers <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
to be expended for the defence and safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard
of the Kingdom, which yet to the value
of <hi>One hundred thousand Marks</hi> have been <hi>lavisht</hi>
away upon the said Duke of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and others.
And though many good <hi>Ordinances</hi> and <hi>Laws</hi>
have been made in <hi>Parliament,</hi> as well for main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
and carrying on of <hi>Wars,</hi> as for the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of the Realm;</hi> yet they have been by them
<hi>disturbed</hi> and <hi>defeated,</hi> to the great dishonour and
damage of the King and Realm.</p>
                        <p>7. <hi>Item,</hi> By such Encroachment, and the great
<hi>Gifts</hi> and <hi>Brokages</hi> taken by the said Duke of
<hi>Ireland,</hi> &amp;c. it came to pass that divers <hi>unfit</hi> and
<hi>insufficient</hi> persons were preferred to, and intrusted
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:99794:65"/>
with the keeping and government of divers <hi>Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
Castles,</hi> and <hi>Countries</hi> involved in <hi>War,</hi> as in
<hi>Guyen</hi> and elsewhere, both beyond and on this
side the Sea; whereby the said <hi>Strong-holds</hi> have
been lost, the Countries wasted, and the People,
faithful Subjects to the King, destroyed, and great
<hi>Seigniories</hi> newly rendred into the hands and
possessions of <hi>Enemies,</hi> without the <hi>Assent of the
Realm,</hi> as the <hi>Marches</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> &amp;c. to the
disinherison of the Kings Crown, and the great
loss of the Kingdom, as in <hi>Harpeden</hi> and <hi>Crad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dock,</hi>
and divers others.</p>
                        <p>8. By the same means, the said Archbishop and
his <hi>Fellow-Traytors</hi> have caused divers people to
be disturbed and deprived of <hi>Right,</hi> and the
<hi>Common Law</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and put to intolerable
<hi>delays, losses</hi> and <hi>costs;</hi> and the <hi>Statutes</hi> and <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
which rightfully for necessary Causes have
been made and given in <hi>Parliament,</hi> have been
<hi>reversed</hi> and <hi>annull'd</hi> by the procurement of the
said <hi>Malefactors</hi> and <hi>Traytors;</hi> and all this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the great <hi>Gifts</hi> and <hi>Brokages</hi> by them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
of <hi>Parties,</hi> to the grand mischief of the
King and Realm.</p>
                        <p>9. <hi>Item,</hi> The said Archbishop and other Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
have <hi>caused</hi> and <hi>counselled</hi> our Lord the King
to grant <hi>Charters</hi> of <hi>Pardon</hi> of horrible Felonies
and <hi>Treasons,</hi> as well against the <hi>State</hi> of the <hi>King,</hi>
as of the Person injured and prosecuting; which
thing is against the King, and the <hi>Oath of the
King.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>10. <hi>Item,</hi> Whereas the said <hi>Seignories</hi> of the
Land of <hi>Ireland</hi> are, and time out of mind have
been parcel of the <hi>Crown of England,</hi> and the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:99794:66"/>
People of <hi>Ireland, Liege Subjects</hi> to our Lord the
King, and his Royal Progenitors Kings of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
who in all their <hi>Charters, Writs, Letters
Patents,</hi> and in their Seals, have for the Aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation
of their Renown and Royalty, been
intituled, <hi>Lords of Ireland;</hi> yet the said Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> as false Traytors, by their said En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachment,
have caused and counselled our Lord
the King as much as in him lies, to have granted
and fully assented and accorded, that the said <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert
de Vere</hi> Duke of <hi>Ireland,</hi> should be made
<hi>King of Ireland.</hi> And to compleat such their ill
purpose, have advised and excited our said Lord

<hi>the Pope,</hi> to <hi>grant, ratifie,</hi> and <hi>confirm</hi> this their
<hi>trayterous Designe,</hi> without the <hi>privity</hi> or <hi>assent</hi> of
His <hi>Realm of England,</hi> and of the said <hi>Land of
Ireland,</hi> to the dividing the Liegance of the
<hi>King</hi> between his <hi>Realm of England,</hi> and the
said <hi>Land of Ireland;</hi> in <hi>diminution of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
honourable Stile,</hi> and open <hi>disinherison of the
Crown of England,</hi> and full <hi>destruction of the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Liege Subjects of our Lord the King, and of the
said Land of</hi> Ireland.</p>
                        <p>11. <hi>Item,</hi> Whereas by the <hi>Great Charter,</hi>
and other good <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Vsages</hi> of the <hi>Realm of
England,</hi> No man is to be <hi>taken,</hi> nor any <hi>Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
put to death, without the due process of Law;</hi>
The said <hi>Nicholas Brember</hi> the <hi>false Knight of
London,</hi> did take <hi>by night,</hi> certain Prisoners, to
the number of 22, out of the Gaol of <hi>Newgate,</hi>
some of them being <hi>Indicted</hi> and <hi>Appealed of
Felony,</hi> and some <hi>Approvers</hi> in <hi>cases of Felony,</hi>
and some on <hi>suspition of Felony,</hi> and carried them
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:99794:66"/>
out of <hi>London</hi> into <hi>Kent,</hi> to a place called <hi>Foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoke;</hi>
and there encroaching on the <hi>Royal Power,</hi>
and in <hi>Defiance</hi> of the said <hi>Laws,</hi> as a <hi>Traytor</hi> to
the <hi>King,</hi> did without any <hi>Process of Law,</hi> cause
them all to be <hi>Beheaded,</hi> except one who was
<hi>Appealed</hi> of <hi>Felony</hi> by an Approver, whom he
set at large the same time.</p>
                        <p>12. <hi>Item,</hi> The aforesaid <hi>Archbishop</hi> and other
<hi>Traytors</hi> have in small Causes taken <hi>great Gifts</hi> in
the <hi>Name of the King,</hi> of divers Parties, to <hi>main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi>
and <hi>abet</hi> them in their <hi>Suits</hi> and <hi>Quarrels,</hi>
and sometimes have play'd the <hi>Ambo-dexters,</hi> and
taken Money of both sides.</p>
                        <p>13. <hi>Item,</hi> Whereas divers of the great Lords,
Loyal Subjects to the King, in divers <hi>Parliaments,</hi>
seeing the dangers, and apprehending the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction</hi>
threatning the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Realm,</hi> by
means of the Mischiefs of these Malefactors, have
<hi>moved</hi> to have good Governance under the <hi>King,</hi>
to avoid the said Perils; The forenamed <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop</hi>
and other <hi>Traytors</hi> by their Encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and fatal Influences have so ordered Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
that the <hi>King</hi> has not onely been <hi>deaf</hi> to
all such Perswasions, but also has <hi>Commanded
some of those that moved it, to depart from his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
and to speak no more of such Matters;</hi> Nor
<hi>touching the good Governance of the King and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
on pain of Death,</hi> to the great prejudice of
the King and Kingdom.</p>
                        <p>14. <hi>Item,</hi> Whereas in the <hi>last Parliament,</hi> all
the <hi>Lords</hi> and other <hi>Sages</hi> there assembled, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>loss</hi> and <hi>destruction</hi> of the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Realm,</hi>
and the <hi>perils</hi> and <hi>mischiefs</hi> aforesaid: and that
the <hi>King</hi> was <hi>departed from the Council of the Realm,</hi>
                           <pb n="124" facs="tcp:99794:67"/>
and wholly <hi>abandon'd himself to the Counsels of the
said Malefactors and Traytors:</hi> By means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the <hi>French King</hi> had Ships, and a Royal Power
on the <hi>Sea,</hi> ready to have arrived in <hi>England;</hi>
and the said <hi>Realm,</hi> and the very <hi>Language of
England to destroy:</hi> And yet no Provision was
made, or good Governance taken for the <hi>safety
of the King,</hi> nor of the <hi>Realm.</hi> Finding no other
<hi>Remedy,</hi> did <hi>Remonstrate</hi> to the <hi>King</hi> very fully,
how he was <hi>Ill-advised,</hi> and Affairs most <hi>pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously</hi>
manag'd by the aforesaid <hi>Traytors</hi> and <hi>Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors,</hi>
declaring to him their <hi>wicked Conditions;</hi>
and most humbly beseeching him for the safety of
himself, and of all his Realm, &amp; avoiding the said
<hi>impending dangers,</hi> to <hi>forsake</hi> and turn these <hi>Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi>
from his <hi>Presence</hi> and <hi>Company,</hi> and no longer
to conduct himself after their <hi>evil Counsel;</hi> but
to hearken to the <hi>sage, loyal, and discreet persons</hi> of
his Realm. Whereupon the said <hi>Archbishop</hi> and
other <hi>Traytors,</hi> to defeat this wholsom <hi>Advice</hi> of
the <hi>Parliament,</hi> by their false <hi>Counsel</hi> did then
cause the King to command the <hi>Mayor of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
suddenly to levy a great <hi>Power of the People
of that City,</hi> to <hi>attaque</hi> and <hi>put to death</hi> all the said
<hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons,</hi> except such as were of their
<hi>Cabal:</hi> At the <hi>Execution</hi> of which <hi>Villany,</hi> the

of the <hi>King</hi> and his <hi>Realm.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>15. Item, <hi>When the said</hi> Archbishop <hi>and other</hi>

the saids</hi> Lords <hi>and</hi> Commons: <hi>They then by such

many days, and did certifie them,</hi> That he would
never Approach the said Parliament, nor Commune
with the said Lords and Commons touching the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of the Realm, for any danger, loss, or mischief
that might happen to him or his Realm, unless he
were first assured by the said Lords and Commons,
that they would not say or act any thing in that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
against any of the said Malefactors, save on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the Process which was began against <hi>Michael
de la Pole: All which was to the great disservice
of the King and of his Realm, and contrary to
the <hi>Ancient Ordinance and Liberties
of Parliament.</hi>
                           </hi>
                        </p>

would not suffer any thing to be commenced,

And afterwards in the said <hi>Parliament,</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

                        <p>20. <hi>Item,</hi> The said <hi>Malefactors</hi> and <hi>Traytors,</hi>
after they had <hi>Estranged</hi> both the <hi>Person</hi> and <hi>good

and that he esteem'd them <hi>Traytors</hi> and

<hi>Brember</hi> and <hi>Blake</hi> carried to the <hi>Mayor</hi> the said
<hi>false Indictment,</hi> commanding him on behalf of

the same. And also they ordered, that a <hi>strong

<hi>Lancaster</hi> upon his first Arrival.</p>
                        <p>21. <hi>Item,</hi> The said <hi>Traytors</hi> having <hi>trayterously</hi>
informed the King, that he should believe that
the said <hi>Ordination, Statute,</hi> and <hi>Commission,</hi> were
made in <hi>derogation</hi> of his <hi>Royalty</hi> and <hi>Prerogative;</hi>
did further perswade him, that the same was
made with an intention to <hi>degrade,</hi> and finally to
<hi>depose</hi> our Lord the King: And perceiving that
thereby he lookt upon his Loyal Lords as <hi>Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi>
and <hi>Enemies,</hi> They yet further advised Him,
that by all means possible, as well by the <hi>power</hi> of
his own <hi>Liege People,</hi> as by the <hi>force</hi> of his <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi>
the <hi>French</hi> and others, he should destroy
and put to death the said Lords and others that
assented to the making of the said <hi>Ordinance,</hi> and
that the same might be done so <hi>privily</hi> that none
should know of it till it was done.</p>
                        <p>22. <hi>Item,</hi> In order to these <hi>Treasons,</hi> by their
<hi>Counsels,</hi> they caused the King to send Letters to his
<hi>Enemy</hi> the <hi>French King,</hi> some by <hi>Nicholas South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi>
Groom of his Chamber, and others by other
persons of <hi>base condition,</hi> as well <hi>Aliens</hi> as <hi>Deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zons,</hi>

                        <p>23. <hi>Item,</hi> That usurping to themselves <hi>Royal

for such his <hi>Assistance</hi> to accomplish the said
<hi>Treason</hi> and <hi>Murder,</hi> to <hi>give</hi> and <hi>surrender</hi> to the

                        <p>24. <hi>Item,</hi> That after this <hi>trayterous Contrivance,</hi>
it was agreed between our <hi>Lord the King</hi> and the

And that they should be ready to <hi>destroy</hi> all <hi>those</hi>

and by the false <hi>Answers</hi> of the <hi>Justices,</hi> did

to the making of the said <hi>Ordinances, Statute,

endeavoured to stir up the said <hi>People of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>

                        <p>27. Item, <hi>They also caused it to be</hi> Cryed <hi>and</hi>

                        <p>8. <hi>Item,</hi> The said <hi>Archbishop, Chief Justice,</hi>
and other <hi>Traytors,</hi> caused the <hi>King</hi> to command
his <hi>Council</hi> to make certain persons throughout

to him by them the said <hi>Traytors,</hi> with
an intent to <hi>get such persons as they should name re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
for Knights of the Shire to serve in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi>
And to keep out from thence Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<hi>good and loyal,</hi> against the good Laws and

                        <p>29. <hi>Item,</hi> The said <hi>Traytors</hi> during the time
that the King had so taken both Parties into His
<hi>Protection</hi> as aforesaid, did falsly counsel and
prevail with the <hi>King</hi> to command by His Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
divers <hi>Knights</hi> and <hi>Squires, Sheriffs,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Ministers</hi> of several Counties, to <hi>Levy Men

them.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>30. Item, <hi>During the time of the same</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection,
<hi>they caused the</hi> King <hi>by His</hi> Royal Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<hi>to signifie to the said Duke of</hi> Ireland, <hi>Not
onely that he and others were</hi> Appelled <hi>of</hi> Treason
<hi>as aforesaid; but also that he should have suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient</hi>
Power to guard him, and come with him to

again to the said Duke of</hi> Ireland, <hi>That he should</hi>
take the Field with all the Forces he could assemble;
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:99794:71"/>
And that the King would meet him with all his
Troops, and would expose and venture his Royal
Person: And that the King was in great peril for
Himself and his Realm, unless succor'd and aided
by the said Duke: And that the said Duke should
shew and declare to all the people assembled with
him, That the King would bear and pay all Debts and
Costs of the said Duke of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and all that joyn'd
with him. <hi>By vertue of which Letters, and the
evil and trayterous</hi> Instigation <hi>as well of the said</hi>
Duke, <hi>as of his</hi> Adherents <hi>and other</hi> Traytors,
<hi>The said</hi> Duke <hi>of</hi> Ireland <hi>did actually Levy and</hi>
Assemble great numbers of Men at Arms, and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,
<hi>as well of the Counties of</hi> Lancaster, Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,
<hi>and</hi> Wales, <hi>as of other places of the</hi> Realm,
<hi>in Warlike manner,</hi> to destroy and put to death the
said Lords, <hi>who had consented to the making the
said</hi> Ordinance, Act of Parliament, and Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
<hi>in</hi> Defence of the King and Realm.</p>
                        <p>31. <hi>Item,</hi> That having thus <hi>Trayterously Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied
Forces,</hi> the said <hi>Duke marched</hi> with them
through the midst of <hi>England,</hi> and usurping the
<hi>Royal Power,</hi> did cause the <hi>Kings Banner</hi> to be
<hi>Displayed</hi> before him, contrary to the Estate of
the King, and of his Crown. In which <hi>March</hi>
the said Duke and his <hi>Accomplices</hi> were by the
<hi>Grace of God</hi> disturbed, and prevented from their
<hi>evil purposes.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>32. <hi>Item,</hi> That the said Duke of <hi>Ireland,</hi> by
the Counsel and Abetment of the rest of the
fore-named <hi>Traytors,</hi> encroaching to himself the
<hi>Royal Power,</hi> without the usual <hi>Commission of the
King,</hi> or other <hi>sufficient Warrant,</hi> Did make
himself <hi>Justice of Chester,</hi> by him and his <hi>Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
                           <pb n="134" facs="tcp:99794:72"/>
to hold there all manner of <hi>Pleas of the
Crown,</hi> and thereupon to give <hi>Judgment,</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Execution:</hi> And also caused divers <hi>Original</hi>
and <hi>Judicial Writs</hi> to be Sealed with the <hi>Great
Seal</hi> of the King in that behalf used: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
compelled a great part of the people of those
Counties to joyn with him, or otherwise put
some of them to grievous and tormenting Death,
Imprisoned others, and Seized the Lands of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> And all this to make <hi>War,</hi> and destroy
the said Lords, and other Loyal Subjects of the
<hi>King,</hi> and against the <hi>Defence</hi> of the <hi>Realm.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>33. <hi>Item,</hi> That the said <hi>Traytors</hi> have caused
the <hi>King</hi> to grant great <hi>Retinues</hi> to divers people,
and give them <hi>Badges and Ensigns</hi> otherwise than
ever was used in the time of any of his <hi>Progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors;</hi>
and <hi>this</hi> with design to gain greater power
to accomplish their <hi>Treasons.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>34. <hi>Item,</hi> Fully to compleat all such their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-mentioned
and other <hi>Treasons,</hi> and to make
the King wholly confide in, and relie upon them
and their Councels, they caused the King to call
before him divers <hi>Justices</hi> and <hi>People of the Law,</hi>
that is to say, <hi>Robert Tresylian, Robert Belknap,
John Care, John Holt, Reger Fulthorp, William
Burgh,</hi> six Justices, <hi>John Lockton</hi> Serjeant at
Law, and <hi>John Blake:</hi> Of whom he did by the
contrivance of the said <hi>Traytors</hi> demand, Whether
the before-mentioned <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> and
<hi>Commission</hi> were made in <hi>derogation</hi> of his <hi>Royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
and <hi>Prerogative,</hi> or not? and several other Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions;
to which they <hi>Answered</hi> in manner and
form before set forth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <hi>These were the Articles</hi> Exhibited; but
the prime <hi>Delinquents,</hi> as the Duke of <hi>Ireland,</hi> the
Archbishop of <hi>York,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> were
fled, and the rest <hi>absconded:</hi> The Chief Justice
<hi>Tresylian</hi> having <hi>disguis'd</hi> himself, lay hid at an
<hi>Apothecaries</hi> House near the Gate going into the
<hi>Old-Palace</hi> at <hi>Westminster.</hi> But on <hi>Wednesday</hi> the
11th <hi>Calends</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> being discovered by his
Servant, he was taken and brought by the Duke
of <hi>Glocester</hi> to the <hi>Parliament,</hi> who immediately
Awarded Execution against him; so that he was
the same day <hi>drawn from the</hi> Tower <hi>through the
midst of the City of</hi> London <hi>to</hi> Tyburn, <hi>and there
hang'd:</hi> That Judgment having formerly been
pass'd upon him, when ever he could be found,
in the same <hi>Parliament.</hi> The very next day
they met with Sir <hi>Nicholas Brember,</hi> whom the
King had often before preferred to be <hi>Mayor</hi> of
<hi>London, against the will of the Citizens,</hi> and who
had been the occasion of many Oppressions and
Seditions in that City: It was reported of him,
that whilst he was in power, he had caused a <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Hatchet</hi> to be made, wherewith to cut off
the Heads of all that opposed his Exorbitant do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and caused a <hi>List</hi> to be made of a vast num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the <hi>Citizens Names</hi> whom he designed for
<hi>destruction,</hi> of whom he had procured <hi>Eight thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
five hundred and upwards to be already Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted;</hi>
But was now before he could bring to pass
such his malicious bloody purpose, Himself <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed
with the very same Instrument;</hi> the King in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceding
for him with the Parliament, that he
might not be <hi>Hang'd.</hi> This <hi>Gentleman</hi> if he had
lived was to have been made <hi>Duke of Troy,</hi> mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:99794:73"/>
thereby <hi>London,</hi> which anciently was said to
have sometimes been called by that Name.</p>
            <p>Shortly after <hi>Vske</hi> the <hi>under Sheriff</hi> of <hi>London,</hi>
and the before-mentioned <hi>John Blake</hi> the <hi>Lawyer,</hi>
were likewise drawn from the <hi>Tower</hi> to <hi>Tyburn,</hi>
and there Hang'd and Beheaded, and the Head of
the said <hi>Vske</hi> placed upon <hi>Newgate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the beginning of <hi>May,</hi> Sir <hi>Simon de Burlee</hi>
was Condemned for <hi>High-Treason;</hi> but the King
dispensing with his <hi>Drawing</hi> and <hi>Hanging,</hi> he was
<hi>Beheaded</hi> on <hi>Tower-hill.</hi> This person by his ill Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises
had in few years increas'd his small <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi>
of 20 <hi>Marks,</hi> to an Estate of above <hi>Three
thousand Marks per annum;</hi> and was grown to that
excess of pride, that at a <hi>Christmass</hi> he would give
<hi>Liveries</hi> to a great number of Knights and Squires
of the Court, and others, bestowing therein some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
an hundred and forty, or an hundred and
sixty, nay sometimes two hundred and twenty
<hi>Broad Cloaths,</hi> and these of great price, as being
Embroidered with Gold, and some of <hi>Scarlet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About the same time Sir <hi>John Beauehamp</hi> was
Condemned to be Drawn, Hang'd, and Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd;
but by the <hi>Kings Mercy,</hi> he had only his
Head sever'd from his Body on <hi>Tower-hill.</hi> The
same punishment was inflicted on Sir <hi>John Berneys,</hi>
a Knight belonging to the Court Condemned for
<hi>Treason</hi> and <hi>Sedition;</hi> but Sir <hi>John Salisbury</hi> was
drawn from the <hi>Tower,</hi> and <hi>Hang'd</hi> at <hi>Tyburn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now the <hi>Judges</hi> are brought to Judgment,
which in the beginning of the <hi>Parliament</hi> were
taken into Custody; <hi>viz.</hi> Sir <hi>Robert Belknappe,</hi> Sir
<hi>John Care,</hi> Sir <hi>John Holte,</hi> Sir <hi>Roger de Fulthorp,</hi>
Sir <hi>William de Burgh,</hi> and <hi>John Locton</hi> Serjeant at
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:99794:73"/>
Law, who were all condemn'd to be <hi>Drawn,
Hanged,</hi> and <hi>Quartered:</hi> But by the <hi>Mediation</hi> of
the <hi>Queen,</hi> the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and
other Bishops, the King by the consent of the
Lords, against whom they had offended, pardon'd
the <hi>Sentence of Death:</hi> But they were Out-law'd
and Banisht for ever into <hi>Ireland,</hi> Two and two to
be kept in a place, limited within certain Bounds,
which if they should presume to go out of, they
were immediately to be <hi>Executed on their former
Judgment.</hi> And for their <hi>Maintenance</hi> were allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out of the <hi>Kings Exchequer,</hi> as follows; <hi>viz.</hi>
To <hi>Fulthorp 40 l. per annum,</hi> to <hi>Burgh 40 Marks,</hi>
to <hi>Belknappe 30 l.</hi> to <hi>Holt 40 Marks,</hi> and to <hi>Care</hi>
and <hi>Locton 20 l. per annum</hi> apiece.</p>
            <p>This being done, a <hi>General Pardon</hi> is pass'd for
all <hi>Treasons</hi> and <hi>Seditions</hi> whatsoever, and an <hi>Oath</hi>
(saith <hi>Walsingham)</hi> exacted not only of all the
<hi>Inhabitants</hi> of the Land, but of the <hi>King too,</hi> to
stand to the <hi>Regulation</hi> of the Lords, (meaning, as
I conceive, <hi>those so Commissioned and Authorized</hi>
for one years space by King and Parliament as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid:)
And then the Parliament broke up in
the Month of <hi>July.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After <hi>Whitsontide</hi> the Earl of <hi>Arundel</hi> again puts
to Sea, and <hi>burns-sinks, and takes Fourscore French
Ships;</hi> And likewise Seizes the <hi>Isles of Ree</hi> and
<hi>Oleroon</hi> (the latter famous for the <hi>Laws Marine,</hi>
there said to be Compos'd and agreed upon)
with the City of <hi>Rochel</hi> and divers other places.
About the same time the <hi>Scots</hi> entred <hi>England</hi> as
far as <hi>Newcastle,</hi> in which young <hi>Peircy,</hi> Son of
the Earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and for his Valour
and Fury in Arms, Surnamed <hi>Hot-spur,</hi> being
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:99794:74"/>
them Ingarrison'd, he with a small Party fought
with them, and with his own hand slew <hi>W. Dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glass</hi>
their Commander in Chief; but being at last
over-powr'd by the coming in of the Earl of <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar,</hi>
was himself taken Prisoner, though at the
same time he <hi>set free his Countrey:</hi> For he had first
so weakned them by the <hi>destruction of their Men,</hi>
that they durst not stay longer, but in hast and
disorder retreated into <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>After Harvest a</hi> Parliament <hi>was again held at</hi>
Cambridge, <hi>in which many</hi> wholsome Laws <hi>pass'd;
As against</hi> Beggars, Riding Arm'd, giving Liveries
to excessive Retinues: <hi>Touching</hi> Labourers, <hi>and</hi>
Apparel <hi>suitable to peoples Ranks: And especially,</hi>
That none should go out of the Realm to the Pope to
procure the Grant of any Benefices in <hi>England</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Kings leave, on penalty of being put out of the
Kings protection. <hi>Also a</hi> Tax <hi>was granted to the
King, being a</hi> Tenth of the Clergy, <hi>and a</hi> Fifteenth
of the Laity.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1389, a grievous <hi>Discord</hi> happen'd
at <hi>Oxford</hi> between the <hi>Welsh</hi> and the <hi>Northern
Scholars,</hi> wherein several were slain, and further
mischief threatned; but by the Mediation of the
Duke of <hi>Glocester,</hi> the <hi>Broil was composed,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of the <hi>Welshmen</hi> dismiss'd the <hi>Vniversity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>In</hi> May <hi>the King held a</hi> Great Council <hi>at</hi> West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster,
<hi>and on</hi> Holy-Road-day, <hi>being led by the</hi>
Advice of certain Whisperers, <hi>entred suddenly into
the</hi> Council-Chamber, <hi>and taking his</hi> Seat, <hi>Deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,</hi>
How old they took him to be? <hi>Being answered,</hi>
Somewhat upwards of One and twenty years: <hi>Then
(replyed He)</hi> I am of full Age, and capable to
manage my Inheritance my self; for sure 'tis unjust
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:99794:74"/>
that I should be in a worse condition than any other in
my Kingdom; for every Heir after the death of his
Ancestor, comes to his Estate, and takes it into his
own hand at one and twenty years of age. <hi>This the
Lords perhaps might be unwilling to Grant, but
more unable and afraid to deny: And therefore
the King went on with his Speech;</hi>—'Tis well
known, that for many years I have lived under your
Tutelage and Governance, and for the pains therein
We thank you; but now having attained to Our Legal
Age, We are resolved to be no longer in Ward, but to
take into Our hands the Government of Our Realm,
and to appoint such Officers and Ministers as We think
fit, and remove others at Our pleasure.</p>
            <p>Accordingly he forthwith commanded the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of <hi>York,</hi> then <hi>Lord Chancellour,</hi> to Resign the
<hi>Seal;</hi> which being done, the King put it up in his
Bosom and went away, but soon after returned,
and gave it to <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Wickham</hi> Bishop of <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester,</hi>
making him <hi>Lord Chancellor:</hi> He likewise
turn'd out the Bishop of <hi>Hereford</hi> from the Office
of <hi>Treasurer,</hi> and put in another in his room; and
chang'd several other <hi>chief Ministers of State,</hi> partly
to shew his <hi>Authority,</hi> partly to satisfie his <hi>Displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure;</hi>
As particularly he <hi>suspended</hi> his <hi>Vncle</hi> the
Duke of <hi>Glocester,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> and
others from his <hi>Privy Council,</hi> and admitted others
in their stead, that <hi>Humour'd</hi> him more, but <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd</hi>
him less. The Earl of <hi>Arundel</hi> likewise was
removed from the <hi>Admiralty of the Sea,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
he had been entrusted by the <hi>Parliament,</hi>
and the same given to the Earl of <hi>Huntington.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Soon after this, certain <hi>Detractors</hi> circumvent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the King, had so far prevail'd, as to make him
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:99794:75"/>
believe, That the Duke of <hi>Glocester</hi> was contriving
some <hi>Designs</hi> against him: But upon the Dukes
Examination, the <hi>falshood</hi> and <hi>Malice</hi> of those <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports</hi>
did appear; And the King <hi>blusht</hi> to consider
his own <hi>Credulity</hi> against so near and eminent a
<hi>Relation;</hi> yet though some of the <hi>Spreaders</hi> thereof
were there present when the Duke would have
questioned them for the same, the King charged
him, <hi>as he lov'd him,</hi> not to stir farther in the
<hi>matter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Summer the King being at his <hi>Mannor</hi> of
<hi>Sheen,</hi> in <hi>July,</hi> on a sudden there appeared such
innumerable <hi>Swarms</hi> of <hi>Gnats,</hi> that all the Air was
darkned with them, who skirmisht and fought one
with another, till the <hi>Slain</hi> fell down in <hi>heaps,</hi> and
being swept together with Brooms, amounted to
the quantity of many <hi>Bushels-full,</hi> and the rest who
seem'd to come off, and were reckoned about a
third part of the whole, flew away; which was
by many esteem'd as an <hi>ill-boding Prodigy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About the same time the <hi>Disciples</hi> of <hi>Wickliff</hi> (in
those days called <hi>Lollards)</hi> being very numerous,
their <hi>Presbyters</hi> took upon them after the manner
of <hi>Bishops,</hi> to confer <hi>Holy Orders,</hi> Asserting, that
every Priest had as much power of <hi>Binding and
Loosing,</hi> and <hi>Administring other Ecclesiastical Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctims,</hi>
as the <hi>Pope himself</hi> either had, or could be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow:
And though the <hi>Prelates</hi> had notice hereof,
yet out of <hi>negligence,</hi> or rather <hi>fear,</hi> they did not
much concern themselves to suppress them; save
only the stout Bishop of <hi>Norwich,</hi> who swore, That
if any of that <hi>Sect</hi> should presume to Preach in his
<hi>Diocess,</hi> he would either <hi>Burn</hi> or <hi>Behead</hi> them.</p>
            <p>In <hi>November,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Lan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

years absence return'd into <hi>England</hi> from <hi>Spain,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
matcht his Daughter to the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Castile</hi>'s
Son. And the King of <hi>England</hi> having summon'd
a <hi>Council</hi> at <hi>Reading,</hi> the said <hi>Duke</hi> understanding
that his Majesty had conceived <hi>Displeasure</hi> against
divers great Lords, to prevent the <hi>Mischiefs</hi> that
might thereby arise, immediately after his <hi>Arrival,</hi>
posted thither; by whose <hi>good Offices</hi> the <hi>King's
Resentments</hi> were diverted, and <hi>Matters</hi> for the
present pacified.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1390, (being the 13 year of King
<hi>Richard</hi>'s Reign) on <hi>Munday</hi> after the <hi>Feast</hi> of
St. <hi>Hillary,</hi> a <hi>Parliament</hi> was called at <hi>London,</hi>
wherein amongst other things it was Enacted, That
the <hi>King</hi> should not extend his <hi>Pardon</hi> to any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
convicted of <hi>Murder,</hi> and a Penalty <hi>Awarded</hi>
against any that should importune the <hi>King</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto;
<hi>viz.</hi> That if it were a <hi>Duke</hi> or <hi>Archbishop,</hi>
he should forfeit to the <hi>King 100 l.</hi> If an <hi>Earl</hi> or
<hi>Bishop, 100 Marks,</hi> &amp;c. There was also granted
to the <hi>King 40s.</hi> of every <hi>Sack of Wool,</hi> of which
<hi>10s.</hi> to go to the <hi>Kings</hi> present occasions, and the
other <hi>30s.</hi> to be <hi>reserv'd</hi> in the hands of <hi>Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners</hi>
appointed by <hi>Parliament, Not to be expended

Henry</hi> Earl of <hi>Derby,</hi> eldest Son to the <hi>Duke</hi> of
<hi>Lancaster,</hi> with a choice Company of a thousand
Knights and Squires, and their Servants, went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Prussia,</hi> where they signalized themselves by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
brave and valorous Actions; and return'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
with Honour in <hi>April</hi> following.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1391, the <hi>French</hi> Courted <hi>King
Richard</hi> very earnestly to a <hi>Treaty</hi> of <hi>Peace;</hi> and
in order thereunto, desired that there might be an
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:99794:76"/>
               <hi>Amicable Interview</hi> of the two Kings neer <hi>Calice:</hi>
To which King <hi>Richard</hi> seem'd inclinable; and
that he might appear more <hi>splendid</hi> on such an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
sent to most of the <hi>Abbeys</hi> to furnish him with
the best <hi>Horses</hi> they had: Amongst whom the
<hi>Abbot</hi> of S. <hi>Albans</hi> sent him <hi>One,</hi> which <hi>(Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>singham</hi>
tells us) was worth <hi>Four and twenty Marks,</hi>
no small price in those days; and yet not content,
he demanded 50 <hi>Marks</hi> besides in Money: Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
from most of the Cities and Burroughs of
<hi>England,</hi> he got divers considerable Sums to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quip
him for this Voyage.</p>
            <p>But about the same time, by order of the <hi>King
and Council,</hi> there was a <hi>Proclamation</hi> set forth,
Requiring all those that had any <hi>Benefices</hi> in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and were then beyond the Seas, as in the
<hi>Roman Court,</hi> (it being a thing not infrequent in
those days, for the <hi>Pope</hi> to gratifie his <hi>Favourites</hi>
and <hi>Followers</hi> with the best <hi>Preferments,</hi> though
perhaps never in <hi>England</hi> in their lives) immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately

<hi>Realm,</hi> by expending their <hi>Revenues</hi> in other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
on pain of <hi>forfeiting</hi> all their said <hi>Benefices.</hi>
This, together with the late Statute of <hi>Provisors</hi>
and <hi>Praemunire,</hi> and the <hi>Overture</hi> of a <hi>Peace</hi> like
to advance with the <hi>French King,</hi> (who at that
time joyned with the <hi>Antipape, Benedict</hi> the 13th)
much troubled <hi>Pope Boniface</hi> the 9th: (For now,
and for neer the space of <hi>forty years</hi> together, there
were <hi>two Popes</hi> in being at once, each <hi>Cursing</hi> the

<hi>One,</hi> and part his <hi>Adversary.)</hi> Therefore the said
<hi>Boniface</hi> (whom the <hi>English</hi> own'd for their
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:99794:76"/>
               <hi>Ghostly Father</hi>) forthwith sent a <hi>Nuncio</hi> to King
<hi>Richard,</hi> with great Complements to commend
his <hi>Devotion,</hi> and that of his <hi>Predecessors</hi> towards
<hi>Holy Church,</hi> but withal to complain of these <hi>Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions</hi>
(as he was pleased to call them) of the <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
Liberties;</hi> and to urge him as well to
<hi>Repeal</hi> the said <hi>Laws,</hi> as by no means to make
<hi>Peace</hi> with the <hi>French King,</hi> unless he would dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own
and no longer assist the <hi>Anti-Pope,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The <hi>King</hi> received the <hi>Nuncio</hi> kindly, and
heard his <hi>Tale,</hi> but for Answer put him off to the
Meeting of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> which was in <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi>
and then the <hi>Business</hi> was <hi>bandied</hi> about; and
though the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Lancaster</hi> seem'd
willing to gratifie the <hi>Pope,</hi> the <hi>Commons</hi> would by
no means consent that people should go to <hi>Rome</hi> to
acquire any <hi>Benefices</hi> in <hi>England;</hi> only that they
might not seem too much to slight his <hi>Holiness,</hi>
they yielded that it might be suffered, but not
without the <hi>Kings License,</hi> and no longer than till
the next <hi>Parliament.</hi> But though they held <hi>their
Pope</hi> to <hi>hard Meat,</hi> they were not wanting in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
their <hi>kindness</hi> to their <hi>King,</hi> giving him a
<hi>Half-tenth,</hi> and an <hi>Half-fifteenth;</hi> which they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to make <hi>whole Ones,</hi> on condition the <hi>King</hi>
would next Summer make an <hi>Expedition</hi> against
the <hi>Scots.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Anno</hi> 1392. The <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Lancaster</hi> is sent over
into <hi>France,</hi> and most magnificently entertain'd
by the <hi>French King:</hi> But instead of a Peace,
brought back only a <hi>Truce</hi> for a year; to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
saith <hi>Walsingham,</hi> That during that time, the
<hi>collected wisdom</hi> of <hi>England</hi> might consider whether
it were more expedient to conclude a <hi>final Peace,</hi>
or <hi>prosecute</hi> the <hi>War.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:99794:77"/>
About this time, a certain <hi>Matron</hi> in <hi>London</hi>
having one <hi>onely Daughter,</hi> had instructed her to
<hi>Cele<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Furniture in a private Room, and there for many
days caused her to Accouter herself in <hi>Priestly Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit,</hi>
and <hi>Officiate;</hi> onely when she came to the
words of the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> she <hi>Prostrated</hi> herself, and
durst not <hi>Consecrate;</hi> but rising again, would go
on with the rest of the <hi>Mass</hi> to the end, her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>helping</hi> her and <hi>encouraging her Devotion.</hi> But
at last a <hi>Neighbouring Gossip</hi> whom she had call'd
to this <hi>private Mass,</hi> discovering her Practice, the
Bishop of <hi>London</hi> heard of it, and being much
grieved (as he had reason, to see his <hi>Trade</hi> usurp'd
by the other <hi>Sex)</hi> call'd her before him, and made
her shew <hi>her Crown shaven exactly like a Priest,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all the people, and caused both her and her
Mother to do <hi>Penance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Guelderland,</hi> a most <hi>active Prince,</hi>
and related to King <hi>Richard,</hi> sent him a Letter
full of <hi>great Complements,</hi> (but in one expression
too <hi>profane)</hi> stirring him up to War and Military
Actions becoming his Royal Dignity, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
dehorting him from the designed dishonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Amity with <hi>France:</hi> The Tenor whereof,
was as followeth.</p>
            <q>
               <p>MAgnificent Prince! Both your Innate Genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity,
and the prudent Counsels of your Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
will we conceive effectually provide, that all your
Hereditary Rights, which by your Birth render your
Royal Majesty Great and Glorious, may by the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight
of your deep Wisdom be preserved Inviolable;
And that if any unjust Force does Invade or offer to
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:99794:77"/>
Diminish them, your Kingly Industry will valiantly
defend the same with the Shield of Military Prowess:
And since we have the Honour to be <hi>Related</hi> to your
Royal Person by Affinity, <hi>God himself cannot hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
but that we will ever be ready to assist you in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
such your Rights with <hi>Two thousand Laun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>
when and as oft-soever as you shall be disposed to
engage in a War: Nor ought you to decline the same
to your prejudice, for any Words or Promises that
may be made you, from the restless <hi>subtilty of the
French.</hi> 'Tis certain, most Serene Prince, your
<hi>Fame</hi> is spread throughout the World: Nor is it doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
but for your great plenty of <hi>Wool,</hi> and innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
other Commodities (without which neither the
<hi>East</hi> or <hi>South</hi> can subsist) all Kingdoms daily salute
you with their Treasures; so that God himself has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
upon you Wealth an hundred fold more in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison,
than on other Kings. Besides the tried <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour</hi>
of your people, and the sharpness of their <hi>Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Bowes,</hi> have so far advanced the Fame of your
Magnanimous Nation, above any of the <hi>West,</hi> that
<hi>Terror</hi> and <hi>Dread</hi> cannot but Invade your Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;
for evermore to this day, as oft as the <hi>Gallant
English</hi> have fought the <hi>French,</hi> so oft have they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<hi>Victory</hi> with them from the Field. Let not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
most Potent Prince! the Heart of the <hi>Lion</hi>
slumber longer against Nature in Pusillanimity: But
vouchsafe to apply that matchless Strength which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
has conferr'd upon you, to warlike Actions, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of your <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> the maintenance of
your Hereditary Rights, the encrease of your <hi>Merit,</hi>
and perpetuating the Renown of so incomparable great
and Magnanimous a King.</p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:99794:78"/>
               <hi>Walsingham</hi> says, That this <hi>Prince</hi> came also in
person into <hi>England,</hi> to perswade the King against
making <hi>Peace</hi> either with the <hi>French</hi> or <hi>Scots,</hi> and
that he was very honourably entertain'd. But it
seems his motion was not much regarded, for
the time was spun out in further <hi>Truces,</hi> and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
done.</p>
            <p>And now the <hi>Citizens</hi> of <hi>London</hi> fall into the
Kings grievous displeasure, the Causes whereof
are said to be <hi>Two:</hi> The <hi>first,</hi> Their not only
<hi>denying</hi> to lend the King a <hi>thousand pounds</hi> (which
he desired) themselves; but also affronting a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Lombard,</hi> who was willing to accommodate
him: and abusing him (some Authors say, they
beat and half kill'd him) for his <hi>forwardness.</hi> The
<hi>other</hi> an <hi>Accident</hi> which hapning just in the <hi>neck</hi>
of this, seem'd, or perhaps was <hi>made</hi> a far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Offence than otherwise it need have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted,

            <p>A <hi>Baker</hi> carrying his Bread along the Street,
one of the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Salisbury</hi>'s Servants took a <hi>loaf</hi>
out of his Basket; which the <hi>Baker</hi> demanded to
be restored, but the <hi>Bishop</hi>'s man instead thereof
broke his head; for which Injury the people
would have <hi>seized</hi> him, but he fled into his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
house: Thither the <hi>Constable</hi> came, and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
desired he might be surrendred up to Justice.
But the <hi>Bishop</hi>'s Servants shut the Gates, and made
resistance. This more exasperated the people,

having notice, they immediately repaired thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and by their <hi>Presence</hi> and <hi>Authority,</hi> sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
the Multitude, and preserved the Kings
Peace; so that hitherto the harm was but <hi>small:</hi>
and all this <hi>Combustion</hi> might easily have been
<hi>quenched</hi> and <hi>forgot,</hi> had not the <hi>Bishop</hi> (whose
<hi>ill-govern'd</hi> Servant was the Beginner and Cause
of all the <hi>Broil)</hi> kindled the <hi>Fuel</hi> afresh: And
'tis said, he the rather stirr'd in it, out of an old
<hi>grudge</hi> which he had against the <hi>Citizens,</hi> because
they were generally lookt upon to be <hi>Favourers
of Wickliffs Doctrine.</hi> But whatever the Motive
was, <hi>a loud Complaint</hi> was made by him and other
<hi>Prelates</hi> to the King, affirming, That if upon
every <hi>paultry pretence</hi> the <hi>Citizens</hi> should be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
thus to <hi>Affront the Bishops without Chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
they would endanger not only the <hi>Dignity,</hi>
but the <hi>Liberty of the whole Church.</hi> The King was
so incens'd hereat, (being prepared by former
Provocations) that he was once resolv'd to have
raised an Army, and <hi>utterly destroyed the City, and
made spoil thereof.</hi> But being perswaded by more
<hi>moderate Councils,</hi> he only sent for the <hi>Mayor</hi> and
<hi>two Sheriffs,</hi> and <hi>Four and twenty Aldermen,</hi> and
<hi>Four and twenty others</hi> of the ablest <hi>Citizens,</hi> to his
<hi>Court</hi> then held at <hi>Nottingham,</hi> where the said <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult</hi>
and divers other <hi>Offences</hi> were laid to their
<hi>Charge;</hi> As that they had forfeited their <hi>Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
formerly given to the King, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They at
first resolv'd to justifie their <hi>Innocency,</hi> and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
engaged to stand by one another: But it
seems there was <hi>falshood</hi> in <hi>Fellowship,</hi> and as it of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
happens in such Cases, some timorous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons

hoping to <hi>curry favour, Impeach'd the rest,</hi> who
again recriminated upon them, and so <hi>all</hi> were li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to be undone, and therefore left themselves
wholly to the <hi>Kings Mercy,</hi> who committed the
<hi>Mayor</hi> to <hi>Windsor</hi> Castle, and the rest to several
other places of Confinement, seizes the <hi>Liberties</hi>
of the <hi>City</hi> into his own hands, and Annuls all
their <hi>Priviledges,</hi> commands there should be no
more any <hi>Major</hi> be chosen, but that he would
himself appoint one who should be called <hi>Keeper
of the City;</hi> and accordingly did qualifie one Sir
<hi>Edward Dalyngrygge,</hi> (other Authors call him
<hi>Balerygge)</hi> with that Title, who being thought
too favourable to the <hi>Citizens,</hi> was quickly remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and Sir <hi>Baldwin Radington,</hi> a person of a

<hi>Terms</hi> and <hi>Courts</hi> of <hi>Justice,</hi> were removed to
<hi>York.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time, the Duke of <hi>Glocester</hi> and
others were not wanting to <hi>Intercede</hi> with the
King on behalf of the <hi>Londoners,</hi> of whom the
<hi>Principal,</hi> on <hi>Sunday</hi> next after the <hi>Assumption</hi> of
S. <hi>Mary,</hi> waited on him at <hi>Windsor,</hi> and submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to him, <hi>Themselves and their Fortunes:</hi> With
which he seemed somewhat well pacified, and on
the <hi>Wednesday</hi> following came towards <hi>London,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
met from the <hi>City</hi> with four hundred Men on
<hi>Horse-back,</hi> clad all in one <hi>Livery,</hi> an innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
multitude on foot, a <hi>solemn Procession</hi> of the
<hi>Clergy,</hi> and Five hundred Boys in Surplices: The
Fronts of the Houses adorned with <hi>Tapestry</hi> and
<hi>Pictures,</hi> the Conduits freely running <hi>Wine, &amp;c.</hi>
Besides, they presented the King with a <hi>Crown of
Gold</hi> of great value, and another of the same <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal</hi>
               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:99794:79"/>
to the <hi>Queen;</hi> together with a <hi>Picture</hi> of the

And so they obtained their <hi>Priviledges</hi> restored
and confirmed to them, the <hi>Election</hi> of a <hi>Mayor,</hi>
and all things as before: And having been at all
this <hi>Charge,</hi> doubted not but to be quiet and free
from further <hi>Fine</hi> or <hi>Penalty.</hi> But herein they
were deceived; for notwithstanding all their <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents,</hi>
the King yet upon such <hi>submission</hi> before
made, demanded and forced them to pay after all
this, <hi>Ten thousand pounds,</hi> or else they must have
ventured the <hi>Effects</hi> of his new <hi>Displeasure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Glocester</hi> having been furnisht

            <p>The Year 1393, a <hi>Parliament</hi> at <hi>Winchester</hi>

<hi>Conclusions</hi> touching <hi>Ecclesiastical Persons,</hi> and
the <hi>Sacraments</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> At which the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi>
were much disturb'd, and according to their
usual Method, instead of clearing themselves, and
confuting their <hi>Adversaries</hi> by <hi>Scripture</hi> or <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>
endeavoured to silence them by <hi>Club-law,</hi>
dispatching away the <hi>Archbishop</hi> of <hi>York,</hi> and <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi>
of <hi>London,</hi> into <hi>Ireland</hi> to the King, intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him to hasten his return, to succour <hi>Faith</hi> and
<hi>Holy Church,</hi> that were both like to be undone
by the <hi>Hereticks,</hi> who were contriving how to
take away the <hi>Possessions</hi> of the whole Church, and
overthrow all the <hi>Canonical Sanctions.</hi> Upon this
News, back comes the King from <hi>Ireland,</hi> and
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:99794:81"/>
takes several of the Chief Favourites of the <hi>Lol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lards</hi>
to task, threatning most terribly if they
shew'd them any Countenance for the future.
But the <hi>Hereticks</hi> were not the onely <hi>Afflicters</hi> of
the <hi>Clergy</hi> at this time; but Birds of their own
Nests began to pluck their feathers too: for <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi>
Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> got a <hi>Bull from the
Pope,</hi> Impowering him to levy throughout all the
<hi>Diocesses</hi> of his <hi>Province, Four pence in the pound
of all Ecclesiastical Goods and Revenues,</hi> as well of
those Exempt, as not Exempt; and this without
so much as <hi>pretending any true or lawful Cause for
the same.</hi> However, the Execution of this <hi>Bull</hi>
being committed unto the Archbishop of <hi>York,</hi> and
the Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> though many of the inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
<hi>Clergy</hi> grumbled not a little, and complained
thereof as unreasonable, yet they were generally
forced to submit unto it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno Domini</hi> 1396, the Duke of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> to
whom the King had given the Dutchy of <hi>Aquitain,</hi>
and who had been at <hi>inestimable Charges</hi> in those
Parts, to <hi>Conciliate</hi> to himself the <hi>Affections</hi> of the
<hi>Inhabitants;</hi> no sooner had obtained the same,
but he was suddenly recall'd from thence by the
Kings Command. To which, though it seemed no
less <hi>hard</hi> than <hi>unexpected,</hi> the Duke paid a <hi>punctual
Obedience,</hi> and was received if not with <hi>love,</hi> yet
at least with a <hi>shew of honour</hi> by the King; from
whom having obtain'd License to depart the
<hi>Court,</hi> he hastened to <hi>Lincoln,</hi> and there to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration
of all the World, (by reason of the <hi>dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
of their <hi>Qualities)</hi> was married to <hi>Katherine
Swinford,</hi> who for divers years before had been
his Mistress.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="154" facs="tcp:99794:82"/>
This year also the <hi>Pope</hi> wrote to the King, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating
him to assist the <hi>Prelates</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> in
the <hi>Cause of God,</hi> and of him the said King and his
Kingdom, against the <hi>Lollards,</hi> whom he declared
to be <hi>Traytors</hi> not onely to the <hi>Church,</hi> but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
to the <hi>King;</hi> and therefore did most ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
press him, That whomsoever the <hi>Bishops</hi>
should declare to be <hi>Hereticks,</hi> he would forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
Condemn by his <hi>Royal Authority.</hi> But it
seems the King was <hi>too busie</hi> otherwise to attend
his <hi>Holiness's Commands,</hi> and to do his <hi>Prelates
drudgery</hi> in <hi>butchering</hi> of <hi>Hereticks;</hi> for he was
making mighty Preparations for a <hi>Voyage,</hi> not of
<hi>War,</hi> but of <hi>Galiantry,</hi> into <hi>France;</hi> where by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement,
the <hi>two Kings</hi> were to have a <hi>Personal

            <p>In order to which, King <hi>Richard</hi> passes over to

and that neither by themselves or any of

should <hi>be contrived or practised any Hostility, Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize,

between the <hi>two Royal Tents</hi> was <hi>Guarded</hi> on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

The Twenty seventh of <hi>October</hi> the <hi>two Kings</hi>
met, Four <hi>French Dukes</hi> waiting on the King of
<hi>England,</hi> and Five <hi>English Noblemen,</hi> viz. the
<hi>Dukes</hi> of <hi>Lancaster</hi> and <hi>Gloucester,</hi> and the <hi>Earls</hi> of
<hi>Derby, Rutland,</hi> and <hi>Northumberland,</hi> attending
the <hi>French</hi> King.</p>
            <p>After an Enterchange of Complements between
their <hi>Majesties,</hi> it was first by <hi>mutual consent</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd,
That a <hi>Chappel</hi> at both their equal Charge
should in the place of their <hi>Interview</hi> be Erected,
which should be called, <hi>The Chappel of our Lady of
Peace:</hi> And on <hi>Saturday</hi> the <hi>Feast</hi> of S. <hi>Simon</hi> and
<hi>Jude,</hi> on further Treaty, it was accorded, That
there should be a <hi>Cessation of Arms</hi> between the
<hi>Two Crowns</hi> for the term of Thirty years; and
that King <hi>Richard</hi> should Espouse <hi>Isabel</hi> the
<hi>French</hi> Kings Daughter, then not above Eight
years old. On <hi>Sunday</hi> the <hi>two Kings</hi> dined toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in King <hi>Richard</hi>'s Tent, and on the <hi>Munday</hi>
the <hi>French</hi> King brought thither the young Lady,
who was entrusted to the Tuition of the <hi>Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>esses</hi>
of <hi>Lancaster</hi> and <hi>Gloucester,</hi> and other English
Ladies, who conveyed her with a Glorious Reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
to <hi>Calice.</hi> And soon after the <hi>two Kings</hi> in a
most amicable manner took their Leaves of each
other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Walsingham</hi> tells us, That besides the <hi>Presents</hi>
made by King <hi>Richard</hi> to the <hi>French</hi> King and his
Nobles, amounting to the value of Ten thousand
Marks and upwards, he spent in this Amorous
Voyage above Three hundred thousand Marks. And
<hi>Trussel</hi> relates, That the Duke of <hi>Gloucester</hi> was
not a little offended both with the <hi>Match</hi> and the
<hi>Truce,</hi> alledging, <hi>That it was more meet to be in
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:99794:83"/>
Arms than Amity with the</hi> French, <hi>who being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
to the</hi> English <hi>in Courage, did ever over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reach
them in Craft, and being too weak for War,
did oft-times prevail and get Advantages by Treaties
of Peace.</hi> That the <hi>French Lady</hi> (being but a
<hi>Child)</hi> was a very unfit <hi>Match</hi> for King <hi>Richard,</hi>
as well by reason of the <hi>Disparity</hi> of their Years,
as for that he had no Issue by his <hi>first Wife,</hi> and
was not like to have any by <hi>this,</hi> unless perhaps
in his <hi>old Age.</hi> But these <hi>Arguments</hi> not prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the <hi>Londoners</hi> however took the Confidence
to <hi>petition</hi> the King; That seeing there was Peace
with <hi>France,</hi> he would <hi>Release them of the Subsidy,</hi>
granted in the <hi>last Parliament,</hi> towards maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Wars against that <hi>Crown.</hi> This <hi>Suit</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by them so importunately followed, as
much <hi>perplexed the King,</hi> untill at length the
Duke of <hi>Lancaster</hi> assured them, That the procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
this <hi>Peace,</hi> had spent and lost the King <hi>Three
hundred thousand pounds,</hi> wherewith they were
pacified, though 'tis probable not very well
pleased.</p>
            <p>The <hi>King</hi> being returned safe into <hi>England</hi> with
his <hi>Baby-Bride,</hi> though not without the loss of his

away by a <hi>Tempest</hi> in crossing the <hi>Channel:</hi> The
Earl of S. <hi>Paul</hi> was soon after sent by the <hi>French</hi>
King to Complement the young <hi>Queen,</hi> who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
understood how earnestly <hi>Glocester</hi> had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh'd
against this <hi>French Alliance,</hi> was ('tis
said) an <hi>eminent Instrument</hi> in contriving and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioning
the <hi>destruction</hi> of that <hi>Duke;</hi> advising the
King, that he was <hi>too dangerous a Subject</hi> to be
suffered, and that it concern'd <hi>His Majesty</hi> both

by him formerly received, and in <hi>Policy</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the <hi>Dangers</hi> which he had cause to fear.
Hereupon the King grows jealous of the Duke,
and as <hi>that passion</hi> is restless, and apt to be fed with
the slightest <hi>Imaginations,</hi> so he began to pry more
narrowly into his <hi>Deportment,</hi> watch his <hi>Words,</hi>
and interpret both <hi>Them</hi> and his <hi>Actions</hi> to the
<hi>worst,</hi> framing to himself many vain <hi>Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions</hi>
and needless <hi>Disquiets.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which another <hi>Accident</hi> not a little contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted;
<hi>viz.</hi> the King having been paid the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
lent the Duke of <hi>Britain</hi> upon <hi>Brest,</hi> Rede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
the <hi>Town,</hi> and thereupon the <hi>English Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers</hi>
that were there in Garrison, were sent home;

askt him, <hi>If he observed those men that stood in such

<hi>Who were they? They were</hi> (said the Duke) <hi>those
Souldiers, who by your Surrendring up of</hi> Brest, <hi>are

so went on to tax the King of an <hi>unadvised Deed,</hi>
with words much <hi>mere unadvised:</hi> Insomuch, that
the King in great anger replyed,—<hi>Why, Vncle!

I refuse to render the Town, when I was tendred the

<hi>crosness</hi> in <hi>Speech;</hi> who endeavoured to excuse

their Brother indeed was more vehement than they
could commend, but they durst assure His Majesty,
That his Heart was</hi> dutiful <hi>and</hi> faithful; <hi>and that
such his vehemency proceeded from a zealous regard
lest His Majesty and his Kingdom should suffer ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in</hi> Honour <hi>or</hi> Revenue, <hi>and therefore His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
had no cause either to fear, or be offended with

but however, the said <hi>two Dukes</hi> not knowing
how far they might be involv'd in that Displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
which they still perceived he retain'd against
their Brother, thought fit, for avoiding the worst,
<hi>to retire from Court,</hi> thereby giving the Duke of

            <p>About the <hi>Octaves</hi> of the Feast of the Virgin

and withal <hi>Ambitious:</hi> To which might
be added, that they were most notable <hi>Flatterers</hi>
too, if it be true that <hi>Bushy</hi> in all his <hi>Speeches</hi> did
not attribute to the <hi>King, Titles of Honour</hi> due
and accustomed; but <hi>such as were fitter for the
Majesty of Almighty God, than for any earthly
Prince.</hi> By the Importunity of these men and
others, <hi>all the Charters of Pardon</hi> formerly granted
by the <hi>King,</hi> were called into question; the

               <hi>Temporal Lords</hi> shewed themselves of the same

to be preferred his Treasurer <hi>Roger de Walden,</hi>
who, because (saith our Author) he <hi>presum'd
to ascend to the Bed of his living Father;</hi> (that is,
to take the <hi>Archbishoprick</hi> whilst the said <hi>Thomas</hi>
surviv'd) was two years afterwards turn'd ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r</hi> tells
us, That when this <hi>Archbishop</hi> was first accused of
<hi>Treason,</hi> he offered to make his <hi>Defence,</hi> but Sir
<hi>John Bushy</hi> besought the King, <hi>That he might not
be admitted to Answer, lest by his great Wit and Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
he might lead men away to believe him.</hi> If all
their Proceedings were like this, we may easily
guess at the <hi>Justice</hi> of the rest.</p>
            <p>In the next place, They proceeded to <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
against the Earl of <hi>Arundel,</hi> who in vain
pleaded the <hi>Benefit of his Pardon,</hi> for he was not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witstanding
sentenc'd to be <hi>Drawn, Hang'd and
Quartered,</hi> which was mitigated by the <hi>King</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:99794:86"/>
to the favour of <hi>Beheading.</hi> The <hi>Earl</hi> when called
to Answer, Condemn'd, and at his Death be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed
not the least <hi>symptoms</hi> either of <hi>Guilt</hi> or
<hi>Fear;</hi> But observing the <hi>Earls</hi> of <hi>Nottingham</hi> and
<hi>Kent;</hi> (of whom the first was his <hi>Son-in-Law,</hi> the
second his <hi>Nephew)</hi> to be bery busie at his <hi>Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution:</hi>
He calmly said to them,—<hi>Truly it
might have beseemed you at least rather to have been
absent; but the time will come ere-long, that as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
shall marvel at your Misfortune, as they do now
at mine.</hi> This <hi>Earl</hi> was wonderfully belov'd by
the <hi>Comons;</hi> and <hi>Walsingam</hi> affirms, That the
<hi>King</hi> was afterwards haunted with an <hi>Imagination</hi>
of his <hi>Ghost,</hi> not being able to close his Eyes, but
strait he fancied <hi>Arundel</hi> stood before him: And
the more to disturb him, <hi>a Miracle</hi> was reported,
<hi>That his Head of it self was grown to his Body:</hi>
Which was asserted with so much Confidence, that
the <hi>King</hi> caused his <hi>Tomb</hi> to be opened, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
the <hi>Fiction;</hi> and understanding that still
the People went on <hi>Pilgrimage</hi> thither as to the
<hi>Shrine</hi> of a <hi>Saint,</hi> or <hi>Martyr,</hi> caused the <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin
Fryars</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> amongst whom he was <hi>bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,</hi>
to take down his <hi>Scutcheons,</hi> and <hi>abscond</hi> his
<hi>Grave,</hi> by laying a <hi>new Pavement</hi> over it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Lord Thomas Beauchamp</hi> Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi>
upon his <hi>Arraignment,</hi> did not carry himself with
so much <hi>Courage</hi> and <hi>Gallantry,</hi> but confess'd with
<hi>Tears</hi> he had been a <hi>Traytor</hi> in joyning with the
<hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Glocester,</hi> and other <hi>Lords</hi> formerly
acting <hi>against the Kings pleasure:</hi> Therfore
thogh condemned to Die, the <hi>King</hi> remitted
that <hi>Punishment,</hi> and only ordered him to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
<hi>Imprisonment</hi> in the <hi>Isle of Man.</hi> The <hi>Lord
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:99794:86"/>
Cobham</hi> was also <hi>banisht,</hi> though there was no <hi>new
Matter</hi> against him: But only that he had been
appointed by <hi>Parliament,</hi> to be one of the <hi>Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners</hi>
of <hi>Inspection</hi> before mentioned, in the tenth
year of his Reign.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Glocester,</hi> having so great
an Interest in the <hi>Affections</hi> of the <hi>People,</hi> it was not
thought safe to bring him to a <hi>publick Tryal,</hi> but
concluded with more <hi>Policy</hi> than <hi>Justice,</hi> to
put him to death <hi>secretly,</hi> without either <hi>Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>
or <hi>Examination:</hi> And therefore being a
<hi>close Prisoner</hi> as aforesaid at <hi>Callice,</hi> he was by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Ruffians</hi> ordered thereunto by <hi>Nottingam
Earl Marshal,</hi> suddenly one Night <hi>strangled</hi> or
<hi>stifled to death between two Feather Beds.</hi> Thus fell
this <hi>Great,</hi> and (for ought we find in Writers of
those times) <hi>Good Prince,</hi> the <hi>Son of One,</hi> and
<hi>Vncle of another King,</hi> and so beloved of the <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>
that <hi>with him</hi> (saith <hi>Walsingham) the general
Hope and Comfort of the Commonalty of the Land ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now the <hi>King</hi> caused the <hi>Parliament</hi> to be
<hi>Ajourn'd</hi> till after <hi>Christmas,</hi> and then to sit again
at <hi>Shrewsbury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where in the beginning of the Year 1398,
they met accordingly; and the <hi>King</hi> by the <hi>Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest</hi>
he had made amongst them, caused not only
all the <hi>Proceedings</hi> of the <hi>Parliament</hi> in the Tenth
Year of his Reign, to be <hi>Condemned</hi> and <hi>Annulled;</hi>
But also obtained a <hi>Concession</hi> from them, That af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the <hi>present Parliament</hi> should break up, <hi>Its
whole Power should yet be Conferred upon and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
in certain Persons by them particularly named,
or any Seven or Eight of them.</hi> Who by vertue of
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:99794:87"/>
such Power granted, did afterwards proceed to
<hi>Act and determine</hi> many things concerning the
<hi>Publick State of the Nation,</hi> and properly the <hi>Work
of a Parliament,</hi> to the great <hi>prejudice of the
Realm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to six himself more firm with <hi>Friends,</hi> or
Illustrate his <hi>Triumphs</hi> over those he thought
his <hi>Enemies:</hi> The <hi>King</hi> about this time was most
liberal in Conferring of <hi>Honours,</hi> Creating no
less than <hi>Five new Dukes,</hi> of whom one was the
<hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Derby,</hi> made <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Hereford;</hi> and an
other the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Nottingham,</hi> (probably for his
<hi>good Service</hi> in dispatching the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Glocester)</hi>
raised to the Title of <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Norfolk;</hi> One
<hi>Dutchess,</hi> One <hi>Marquess,</hi> and Four <hi>Earls:</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
whom he made a <hi>Distribution</hi> of a great
part of the <hi>Lands</hi> of the <hi>Duke of Glocester,</hi> and of
the <hi>Earls</hi> of <hi>Arundel</hi> and <hi>Warwick;</hi> imagining by
this <hi>double Bounty of Honour and Estate to support
it,</hi> to have tyed them with a double <hi>Obligation</hi> of
<hi>Duty</hi> and <hi>Affection:</hi> Not considering that <hi>hired
Friends</hi> for the most part are seldom either <hi>satisfied</hi>
or <hi>sure;</hi> but rather like some <hi>Ravens</hi> that <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralists</hi>
tell of in <hi>Arabia,</hi> which being <hi>full-gorg'd,</hi>
have very sweet <hi>tuneable Notes;</hi> but <hi>empty,</hi> scriech
most horribly.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, to gratifie the <hi>Cheshire-men,</hi> who
had chieflly assisted him and his late <hi>Favorites,</hi> he
qualified that County with the <hi>Name<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and <hi>Dignity</hi>
of a <hi>Principality,</hi> and added to the rest of his own
Titles, that of <hi>Prince of Chester.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A <hi>General Pardon</hi> was also granted for all <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences</hi>
to all the <hi>Kings Subjects,</hi> but clogg'd with
a strange <hi>Clause</hi> of <hi>Exception,</hi> exempting <hi>Fifty
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:99794:87"/>
Persons</hi> in number, from the Benefit thereof, whose
Names were not expressed, but left to the <hi>Kings</hi>
own <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>pleasure;</hi> to the end, that if
any of the Nobility should happen any way to
displease, he might nominate <hi>him</hi> or <hi>them</hi> to be
of the Number excepted, and so still keep them
within his danger. By which <hi>Reservation</hi> the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Pardon</hi> became <hi>no Pardon at all,</hi> since no
man in <hi>England</hi> could assure himself that he was
included in it.</p>
            <p>Lastly, To <hi>Corroborate</hi> and add the <hi>greater esteem</hi>
to the <hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Proceedings</hi> of this <hi>Parliament,
King Richard</hi> purchased the <hi>Popes Bulls</hi> contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
grievous Censures and <hi>Curses</hi> on all that should
presume to break or oppose them: Which were
solemly published at <hi>Pauls Cross,</hi> and other places
throughout <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All things succeeding thus suitable to the <hi>Kings
pleasure;</hi> the <hi>Heads</hi> of the <hi>Party</hi> that opposed his
Will, having lost their <hi>Heads:</hi> the <hi>Nobles</hi> afraid,
and the <hi>Commons unable</hi> to express their <hi>Resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
any otherwise than in <hi>Sighs,</hi> or <hi>whisper'd
Murmurs</hi> and <hi>Complaints:</hi> His <hi>Officers of State,</hi>
His <hi>Laws,</hi> nay His very <hi>Parliament,</hi> all modell'd
to His <hi>Designs,</hi> He could not but sing <hi>Requiems</hi> to
His <hi>Soul,</hi> and look upon himself in a Condition
altogether <hi>happy</hi> and <hi>secure.</hi> When yet to shew
that there is still an <hi>over-ruling Providence</hi> that can
<hi>blast all Projects,</hi> though never so <hi>subtlely laid,</hi> if
not sounded on <hi>Equity,</hi> and carried on with <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice:</hi>
A <hi>Monarch Paramount,</hi> who <hi>confoundeth
the Councils of Princes, and is terrible to the Kings
of the Earth;</hi> when once they become disobedient
unto, and forgetful of him: Behold on a sudden,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:99794:88"/>
all his <hi>Affairs</hi> by unexpected Means and unlikely
Instruments, are <hi>embroil'd</hi> more than ever, and
this <hi>great Prince</hi> left so destitute of <hi>Power,</hi> or
<hi>Friends,</hi> as to be forced, without striking one
<hi>stroke,</hi> to surrender his <hi>Crown;</hi> and (which was
yet more greivous to a generous Mind) acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
himself both unworthy and unfit to wear it
any longer.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Wonderful Catastrophe</hi> has since been
thought to have been fore-shewn by some <hi>prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Tokens,</hi> that happened about this time: As
that in this Year 1398, when almost throughout
all <hi>England,</hi> all the <hi>Bay-trees withered,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
beyond all expectation, grew <hi>green</hi> again.
And another perhaps more remarkable, on <hi>New-Years
Day</hi> following, When a very <hi>deep River</hi>
running between the <hi>Villages</hi> of <hi>Suelleston</hi> and
<hi>Ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

and divided it self, so as that for <hi>three Miles</hi> space
the <hi>Channel</hi> remain'd <hi>dry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But waving such <hi>uncertain Presages,</hi> if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the several <hi>Steps</hi> that led to this <hi>grand Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation:</hi>
The first both in <hi>order of time,</hi> and <hi>Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi>
may be reckon'd that of the <hi>Banishment</hi> of
the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Hereford,</hi> Son of the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caster:</hi>
This was occasioned by means of a <hi>Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel</hi>
between Him and <hi>Moubray</hi> Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi>
but what the <hi>grounds</hi> were of that <hi>Quarrel,</hi> is
somewhat differently reported by <hi>Authors,</hi> for
though all agree, 'twas about <hi>certain words spoken
to the Kings dishonour,</hi> yet of what <hi>nature</hi> those
words were, is not so certainly <hi>related.</hi> But the
best, that is, <hi>most probable account thereof,</hi> that I
can meet with, is as follows.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:99794:88"/>
The Duke of <hi>Hereford,</hi> either disdaining the
<hi>undes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rved Favours</hi> and <hi>Advancement</hi> of some Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
about the <hi>King,</hi> or <hi>disliking</hi> that his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
should be <hi>abused,</hi> and his Countrey <hi>opprest</hi>
by such <hi>ill Instruments;</hi> or perhaps to shew his
<hi>owm skill</hi> and <hi>sufficiency</hi> in the <hi>Art of Government,</hi>
happened one day in <hi>familiar Conference</hi> with the
Duke of <hi>Norfolk;</hi> to complain, that the <hi>King</hi> too
much undervalued the <hi>Princes of the Blood,</hi> and
much discouraged the rest of the <hi>Ancient Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>
from intermedling in <hi>Publick Affairs:</hi> That
instead of using their <hi>able Advice</hi> and <hi>Service,</hi> He
was engrossed by a few <hi>Vpstart Favourites</hi> of base
<hi>Birth,</hi> and <hi>baser Qualities;</hi> having no sufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
either for <hi>Council</hi> in <hi>Peace,</hi> or <hi>Courage</hi> in <hi>War:</hi>
And whose dishonest Conditions had deservedly
contracted an <hi>Odium</hi> and <hi>Contempt</hi> of the <hi>whole
Realm;</hi> whereby the <hi>Honour</hi> of the <hi>Kings Person</hi>
was much obscured, the <hi>safety</hi> of his <hi>Estate</hi> endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger'd,
and the <hi>Dignity</hi> of the <hi>English Nation</hi> not
a little impaired: And that it was high time, that
the <hi>King</hi> should provide some Redress herein.
And all this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e protested he mention'd not out of a
<hi>Picque</hi> to ary perticular person, but out of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion
for so <hi>publick Grievance,</hi> and <hi>zealous Duty</hi>
to his <hi>Soveraign.</hi> And therefore desired the said
<hi>Duke,</hi> that he being one of the <hi>Kings Cabinet-Council,</hi>
would be pleased to discover unto His
Majesty, these <hi>Enormities</hi> and <hi>Dangers,</hi> that by
removing the <hi>One,</hi> he might happily prevent the
<hi>Other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To these, or some such discourses, the <hi>Duke</hi> of
<hi>Norfolk</hi> seemed much to adhere, assuring <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
that in these <hi>Apprehensions</hi> he had but <hi>Copied</hi>
               <pb n="168" facs="tcp:99794:89"/>
his own <hi>Thoughts,</hi> and seemed not only to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
of what he said, but promised to improve
his <hi>Interest</hi> towards a <hi>Regulation</hi> of the <hi>Matters</hi>
Complained of. And perhaps had the words been
afterwards by him but as <hi>faithfully</hi> related, and
by the <hi>King</hi> as candidly taken, as they were freely
and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> intended, many <hi>Mischiefs</hi> might
have been avoided. But on the contrary, they
were maliciously <hi>mis-recited,</hi> and much <hi>mis-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strued:</hi>
For the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Norfolk</hi> had formerly
sided with the <hi>Lords,</hi> yet it seems Preferment had
taken him off, and he was now become wholly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
to humour the King: And therefore to

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rue himself yet further into favour, acquaints
him with these Complaints of the Duke of <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
but so <hi>exaggreated,</hi> and intermixt with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flective
<hi>Additions,</hi> that the King was highly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed,
and calling <hi>Hereford</hi> before him, charged
him therewith, who denying a great part thereof,
and <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rfolk</hi> as stoutly asserting it, the former chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged
the latter to the <hi>Combate,</hi> who readily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
thereof, which at last the King allows, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing
<hi>Coventry</hi> the place, and <hi>August</hi> following
for the time of decision.</p>
            <p>And though it be not much material to our Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story,
yet to gratify the vulgar Readers Curiosity,
it will perhaps be no unwelcome <hi>digression,</hi> to relate
the <hi>Formality</hi> of the intended <hi>Duel,</hi> between these
two Puissant Peers. On the day therefore appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
each of them attended with a splendid and

               </hi>
was <hi>pro Tempore,</hi> made <hi>High Constable;</hi> and
the Duke of <hi>Surry, High Marshal:</hi> who came to
the Lists Honourably attended with Rich <hi>Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;</hi>
               <pb n="169" facs="tcp:99794:89"/>
suitable to their greatness, each of their
Servants carrying <hi>Tipstaves</hi> for clearing the Field.
Where, first the Duke of <hi>Hereford</hi> as <hi>Challenger,</hi>
mounted on a White Courser, in Caparisons of
Green and Blew Velvet, Embroidered thick with
<hi>Swans</hi> and <hi>Antilopes,</hi> armed <hi>Cap-a-pe,</hi> with his
Sword drawn, approached the Lists: of whom the
Marshal demanding <hi>who he was!</hi> received this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,—<hi>I
am Henry of Lancaster, Duke of Hereford,
that am come hither to do my Devoir, against Thomas
Moubray, Duke of Norfolk: as a false Traytor to
God, the King, the Realm, and me.</hi> And then taking
his <hi>Oath,</hi> that his Qurrel was <hi>true and just,</hi> desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
liberty to enter the Lists, which being gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
he put up his Sword, pull'd down his Beaver,
sign'd himself on the Fore-head with the <hi>Cross,</hi>
took his Spear, and passing the Barriers, dismount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and sat down in a Chair of <hi>Green Velvet,</hi> pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in a Travers of Green and Blew Velvet, at one
end of the Lists.</p>
            <p>Then King <hi>Richard</hi> enters the Field with great
Pomp, accompanied with the Earl of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> who
came out of <hi>France</hi> on purpose to be a <hi>Spectator</hi> of
the Combat, and attended with most of the <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles</hi>
of <hi>England,</hi> and a Guard of Ten Thousand
men in Arms, to prevent any sudden Tumult, or
disorders. His Majesty being seated in a <hi>Chair of
State:</hi> one of the <hi>Kings at Arms</hi> made Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>That none but such as were appointed to Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shall
the Field, should touch any part of the Lists, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
pain of Death.</hi> Which ended, another Herald
cryeth,—<hi>Behold, here</hi> Henry <hi>of</hi> Lancaster, <hi>Duke
of</hi> Hereford <hi>Appellant, who is entred into the Royal
Lists, to do his devoir against</hi> Thomas Moubray,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:99794:90"/>
               <hi>Duke of</hi> Norfolk: <hi>upon pain of being counted false
and Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>reant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Immediatly upon this, appeared the Duke of
<hi>Norfolk</hi> bravely mounted, his Horse barbed with
<hi>Crimson-velvet,</hi> embroydered with <hi>Lions</hi> of Silver,
and <hi>Mulberry Trees proper,</hi> and having taken a like
<hi>Oath</hi> before the Constable and Marshal, that his
Quarrel was <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Just,</hi> entred the Field;
crying aloud, <hi>God aid the Right;</hi> and then light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from his Horse, placing himself in a Chair of
Crimson Velvet opposite to <hi>Hereford,</hi> at the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
end of the Lists, the Marshal viewed their
<hi>Spears,</hi> to see that they were of equal length, and
carried the one himself to the Duke of <hi>Hereford,</hi>
and sent the other by a Knight, to the Duke of
<hi>Norfolk.</hi> This done, Proclamation was made, <hi>to
mount, and address themselves to the Combat.</hi> Upon
which the Dukes instantly mount their Horses,
closed their Beavers, casting their Spears into their
Rest, when the Trumpet sounded, and the Duke of
<hi>Hereford</hi> put his Horse forward, but before <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk</hi>
stirred, the King cast down his <hi>Warder,</hi> and
the Heralds cryed, <hi>stay! stay!</hi> Then the King
causing the Spears to be taken from them, they
returned to their Chairs, whilst he retired to <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,</hi>
to debate what was fit to be done in so weighty
a cause: where after two Hours debate, their <hi>doom</hi>
was agreed upon without fighting, and one Sir
<hi>John Bouray,</hi> by the Kings Command, after silence
proclaim'd, read their Sentence, which was thus:
That forasmuch as the Dukes Appellant, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant,
had honourably appeared in the List
Royal, and were not only ready but forward to
entertain the Combat, therefore it being an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:99794:90"/>
of great consequence, for <hi>avoiding the Effusion
of Christian Blood,</hi> the King by the advice of his
Council had decreed: That <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
should within 15 days <hi>depart the Realm;</hi> not
to return within the space of <hi>Ten Years, on pain of
Death:</hi> without the Kings special Licence; and
after a Second Proclamation, Sentence of Banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was also read against the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi>
but with these several aggravations. First that the
same was for <hi>Life;</hi> Secondly, that the <hi>Cause</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
was expressed to be, for having <hi>urtered Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
words, whereof he could not produce any proof;</hi>
And Thirdly, it was added as part of his further
punishment, That the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing should <hi>receive the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues
of his Lands</hi> until he were satisfied, all such
Sums of Money, as the said Duke had taken out
of the King's Coffers, on pretence of paying the
Garrison of <hi>Callice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And further it was proclaimed, That no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
from thenceforth should presume to <hi>Petition,</hi> or
<hi>Intercede</hi> with the King, in the behalf of either of
these Dukes, to alter this sentence, on pain of his
Majesties high displeasure: which being so decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
the King called them both before him, and
took of them a Solemn Oath, That they should
never <hi>Converse</hi> together beyond the Seas, nor
willingly come into each other's Company.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> soon after, in great grief
and trouble of mind, departed into <hi>Germany,</hi> and
from thence to <hi>Venice,</hi> where in a short time he
died with sorrow, leaving this cautionary Lesson
to all Courtiers, <hi>That greatness abused by whispe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
untruths, draweth, if discovered, certainty of
destruction.</hi> And observable it is, that his Banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:99794:91"/>
was pronunced on <hi>the very day Twelve
Month,</hi> on which the Duke of <hi>Glocester,</hi> had by his
order been <hi>Murdered</hi> at <hi>Calice,</hi> so just is the Divine
<hi>Nemesis:</hi> not only in revenging ill actions, but
causing the punishment to be attended with such
circumstances as may make the world take notice
of it.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Hereford</hi> took his leave of the
King, at <hi>Eltham,</hi> behaving himself so respectfully,
that his Majesty was there pleased to declare, he
would <hi>abate 4 Years</hi> of his Exilement: yet could
not that pacify the Murmurs of the people, who
could not be perswaded that there was any cause
for his being Banisht at all. Exclaiming that it was
against the Law of Arms, the custome of the
Realm, and all Justice; that he should be Exil'd,
who had so honourably offered to mantain his <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal</hi>
according to the Law of the Field. He di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
his course from <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Paris,</hi> where
he was nobly received by the <hi>French King,</hi> and
found such favour in that Court: That he was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
in Marriage, the only Daughter of the Duke
of <hi>Berry:</hi> the said Kings Uncle. But King <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi>
having notice thereof, used means to stop the
prosecution of that Treaty.</p>
            <p>He had not been gone many Months, but his
Father, the Duke of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> pays Nature her
Debt; his Death perhaps being hastened by those
Impressions of grief, which this disgrace of his Son
might occasion on his Spirits. The Character gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
this Duke by Historians, speaks him a man
well advised and wary, an approver of safe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils
with reason, rather than Fortunate Exploits
with hazzard: One that was neither negligent, nor
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:99794:91"/>
ambitiously tender of Glory, and therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
himself towards the King his Nephew, in
terms honourable and respective enough for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
Prince, and yet not so plausible as an uncol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
greatness, and the <hi>depravity</hi> of the Court
might desire, whereby little happened unto him
Extraordinary: either in Prejudice or Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>By his Death, the Dutchy of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> did
lineally descend to his Eldest Son, the said Duke
of <hi>Hereford.</hi> But (as the Nature of Man is very
Prone to hate those whom he hath injured) the
King forthwith seizes all the <hi>Lands and Goods of
the deceased Duke,</hi> endeavoured to perpetuate the
Banishment of the Young Duke, and revoked the
Letters Patent he had granted and consented unto,
for enabling the said Dukes Attornies to sue out
his <hi>Ouster Le Main and Livery</hi> of those Lands,
which during his Exile, should descend to him, his
Homage being formerly concluded upon to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spited
at a reasonable Fine. And all this without
any Crime alleadged (that we can hear of) against
the Father, whereby he should have forfeited his
Estate: or new Provocation given by the Son,
whereby a Cloud might arise for his being deprived
of it.</p>
            <p>This severity could not but enrage the Duke,
who was already sufficiently discontented at his
Banishment, nor were the People sparing to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
(where they durst) against these proceedings
as unjust, and thence to contract, first, a Pity,
and afterwards an high esteem for this Exil'd No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-man,
who though not the Immediate Heir pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptive
to the Crown, (for <hi>Edmund Mortimer,</hi>
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:99794:92"/>
Earl of <hi>March,</hi> was therein before him, the Right
having by Parliament (the common Arbitrator in
that case in those daies,) been formerly declared
to be in his Father, as being Son of <hi>Phillipa,</hi> the
Daughter of <hi>Lionel,</hi> the Third Son of King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
the Third, whereas, the late Duke of <hi>Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi>
was but the Fourth Son of that King.) Yet
being so near it, and thus exasperated, they
thought he might step over that Obstacle. <hi>Si jus
violandum Regni causâ violandum est.</hi> They knew
him to be an active Prince, and of great Courage;
and therefore generally fixt their Eyes on him, as
the man that must be their deliverer from those
grievances and pressures, under which they lay
gasping. And indeed their condition could not
but be very uneasie, for the King having got rid of
two of his Uncles, viz. <hi>Glocester</hi> and <hi>Lancaster,</hi>
(one murdred, the other naturally deceased) and
the Third, which was <hi>York,</hi> either in disdain for
the Indignity offered to his Nephew <hi>Hereford,</hi> or
in distrust of his own safety, being retired with his
Son, the Duke of <hi>Albemarle,</hi> to his House at <hi>Lang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi>
look't upon himself as absolutely <hi>Hors de Page,</hi>
free from any Controul, with which their unwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
gravity was wont somtimes to check his irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
Appetite; and therefore now took a greater
Liberty than before, to disoblige and harass his
People. For thus we find the condition of those
times described.</p>
            <p>That the King abandoned himself to sloth, and
lay plunged in the soft, but destructive Charms of
pleasure; by whose example the Nobility too much
gave themselves up to Ease and Luxury; whereby
Cowardice and Effeminacy crept in, and Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:99794:92"/>
was made both of Manhood and Reputation.
The chief Affairs of State had long been Bias'd
by private respects, which made the Nation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
as well in Riches as Honour: and all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out of due Motion, the <hi>Common-weal</hi> seem'd not
so much by degrees, as with a main Course, and at
once precipating into inevitable Ruine. The <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern</hi>
parts by frequent losses, almost consumed by
the <hi>Scots,</hi> who had taken several important Posts,
and defaced all the Countrey with Slaughter, and
Devastations Towards the <hi>South,</hi> the Merchant
Ships were daily surprized by the <hi>French,</hi> who
likewise frequently pillaged the <hi>Sea-coasts:</hi> And
of the Kings Hereditary Dominions in <hi>France,</hi>
many strong holds were lost by negligence, or sold
by ill advise and Treachery. Forces sometimes
were often pretended to be sent over for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
but so scatteringly, at such unseasonable
times, so ill accommodated, or under such indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet
conduct, that they were occasions rather of
loss, than help. Affairs were managed by such as
neither Nature had design'd, nor Education pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared,
nor Experience qualified for Politicians; but
corrupt or ignorant Ministers by flatteries and
base Arts swai'd in the Kings affections, and dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
of all things at their pleasure, keeping him as it
were beseiged from any better advise. The profits
and revenues of the Crown; nay, the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
was <hi>let to farm,</hi> the King making himself only
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Landlord, and challenging no greater privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
by his Reign, than a <hi>dissolute and uncontro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Life.</hi> Great Sums of Money, were by <hi>new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
and unwonted</hi> means every day rather extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from, than voluntarily granted by the subject,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:99794:93"/>
whereof no advantage accrew'd to the Kingdom,
only private pleasures were maintain'd at an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant
Rate, and <hi>unworthy Favourites</hi> advanced. To
these, the King was so excessively Liberal, that he
was forced to borrow, begg, and extort in many
places, to supply this vain lavish humour, undo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
many without cause, to Inrich a few without
desert. Over and above the <hi>Tenths,</hi> and <hi>Fifteenths,</hi>
and such usual <hi>Taxes,</hi> which were many times ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
double in one Year, strange Impositions
were devised and put in practise, sometimes exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>12d. per poll,</hi> of every Subject, <hi>6s. 8d.</hi> of
every Priest, and Religious Person: great Sums
drawn from the People under the favourable Term
of <hi>Benevolence,</hi> and so much borrowed upon <hi>Privy-Seals,</hi>
that no Man of Ability could escape his
<hi>Loan,</hi> though very seldom any repayment was
made.</p>
            <p>And to add to all former burdens this present
Year, 1399. He charged 17 whole Counties with
taking part against him heretofore with the Duke of
<hi>Glocester,</hi> and the rest of the Lords, and threatned
with <hi>Armed force, to spoil and destroy them as publick
Enemies.</hi> And having thus affrighted them, sent
certain Commissioners, Bishops, and Lords Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral,
to all the said several Shires, to let them
know his heavy displeasue: And that without due
acknowledgment of the Offence, and Submission
to his mercy, he could not receive them into his
Grace and Favour: whereby they were prevailed
upon, to own themselves <hi>Traytors under their Hands
and Seals.</hi> Which was no sooner obtained, but
they were compell'd to pay insupportable Sums of
Money, for the <hi>Redemption</hi> of their Lives and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:99794:93"/>
and procuring their Peace, whereby they
were all so impoverisht, that few were able to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist,
none at present to resist. And yet further to
make Conscience it self accessary to slavery: <hi>New
Oaths</hi> were imposed, not warranted by any Law,
and the People constrained to Seal <hi>Blank Charters,</hi>
and <hi>Obligations,</hi> and deliver them to the Kings use,
wherein whatsoever he pleased might afterwads be
inserted.</p>
            <p>The King bearing so heavy an hand over his
People, 'tis no wonder if they bear an hard Heart
towards him; who being shallow in Judgment,
and not able to cover his Vices, but with a Cloak
of seeming terrible and powerful, became first ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and afterwards contemptible, and drove many
of his Subjects to an Inclination to Revolt, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
rather to run the hazzard of a speedy ruine
by Rebellion, than to perish by such a lingring
Death of slavery.</p>
            <p>In order hereunto, there had been some over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
very privately made by Letters to the Duke
of <hi>Hereford,</hi> importuning his speedy return into
<hi>England:</hi> remonstrating, that as well for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<hi>good</hi> of the Realm, as for their own particular
safeties they should be forced to use force for their
deliverance from these intollerable oppressions, and
therefore solliciting him to be pleased, but to make
the <hi>Head,</hi> and they would furnish the <hi>Body,</hi> with
an able <hi>Army,</hi> and not only help him in bare wishes
and advice, but would joyn Hearts and Hands to
adventure their <hi>Lives and Fortunes in his Quarrel,</hi>
which was also their own, so that the danger should
be common to all, the Glory only his.</p>
            <p>The Duke entertained these Adresses with
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:99794:94"/>
great wariness, and such moderation: that he
seem'd rather worthy of a Kingdom, than desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
of it. But to Whet him to an Edge, and settle
his Resolutions for the Enterprize, there wanted
not an apt and politick Instrument. This was <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
Arundel,</hi> late Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> who
being with the other Bishops in the Parliament,
when his Brother the Earl of <hi>Arundel,</hi> together
with the Earl of <hi>Warwick, &amp;c.</hi> were called into
question, because <hi>Clergy-men</hi> by the Canons are
commanded, not to be present at any <hi>Judgment of
Blood:</hi> He and the rest of that Order, <hi>departed
the House.</hi> Upon which occasion being absent, not
only his Brother was condemned for high Treason,
and Executed, as you have heard, but he himself
Banish't the Realm, his goods seized as forfeit,
and his Archbishoprick conferr'd on another. This
Prelate after this Disaster, did with divers of his
Confederates, by several ways, and in strange dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guises,
come to <hi>Paris,</hi> and in the House of one
<hi>Clomigey,</hi> where the Duke had taken Lodgings,
had frequent Conferences with his Grace touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Affairs of <hi>England;</hi> Their debates you
may Imagine, were managed with the strictest se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy.
And I have alwaies been of Opinion, that
it better becomes a <hi>Romance,</hi> than a serious <hi>Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
for the Author to forge <hi>set Speeches</hi> on such
occasions: wherin, though he may please, he does
but deceive the Reader, for how suitable soever
he may contrive them, yet 'tis forty to one but the
parties themselves, might make use of very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<hi>Topicks;</hi> Without guessing therefore at their
word, let it suffice to say, their Consultations
terminated in a Result, that the Duke should ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:99794:94"/>
himself over into <hi>England,</hi> and try his
Fortune, upon the first convenient opportunity;
Which soon presented it self the most invitingly
that could be imagined.</p>
            <p>The Earl of <hi>March,</hi> appointed by the King to
be his <hi>Lieutenant</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> exposing his person
too adventurously, was slain by the <hi>Wild Irish,</hi> which
so exasperated King <hi>Richard,</hi> that he resolved in
person to revenge his Death. In order to which
he raised a great Army, but not without grievous
Charge to his Subjects, and about <hi>Whitsontide,</hi> set
forwards, accompanied with the Dukes of <hi>Albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marle,</hi>
and <hi>Exeter,</hi> divers of the Nobles, and
many Mitred Prelates, amongst whom, was the
<hi>Abbot</hi> of <hi>Westminster,</hi> a chief Favourite; and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
with him, not only the Sons of the Duke of
<hi>Glocester,</hi> and <hi>Hereford,</hi> (whom he pretended to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
by that expedition in the <hi>Rudiments of
War:</hi> but indeed secured them as <hi>Hostages,</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
any attempts, that might be made in his Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
by their Relations, of whom he was most
apprehensive.) But also all his Treasure, Jewels,
Plate, and Royal Robes: as if he had design'd, (as
in the event it effectually prov'd) to have taken a
final leave of his Kingdom, and Dignity here in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Besides these general discontents of the People,
occasioned by the former ill-conduct, and oppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Corrupt Ministers of state, he just upon his
departure, stumbled upon another Error in Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks;
for being at <hi>Bristol,</hi> it was suggested to
him; That <hi>Henry Piercy,</hi> Earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi>
with others his <hi>Partisans,</hi> intended some disloyal
attempt, and therefore did not tender their service
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:99794:95"/>
in this Expedition: whereupon by a <hi>pursevant,</hi> he
commanded the said Earl with all the Forces he
could raise forthwith to repair to him: whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
the Earl by a Letter returned an excuse, instead
of Compliance, intreating his Majesty to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
how little necessary it would be for the <hi>Irish</hi>
Service, and indeed dangerous to the whole Realm,
to draw men from such remote places, in regard
those Rebels were neither so many, nor so mighty,
but that the King had already sufficient Forces, to
reduce them to Obedience; and to disfurnish the
<hi>Northern</hi> parts of their strength, would but give
an opportunity to the <hi>Scots,</hi> to Invade us. And
therefore begg'd his Majesty, that he would be
pleased in such a juncture, to Excuse him from at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending.
This Answer the King interprets as an
Affront, to his Authority, and in an unadvised
Heat, proclaims the Earl, and all that should take
his part, <hi>Traytors:</hi> and orders all their Lands, and
Goods to be seiz'd to his Use. The Earl resenting
this disgrace, and forced (as it were by necessity)
does then in earnest make good the Original Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
by standing upon his Guard: or rather in
a posture of open Hostility.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the King pursues his voyage
for <hi>Ireland,</hi> whose Arrival Fortune courted with
some <hi>treacherous smiles;</hi> for the petty <hi>Irish Kings</hi>
terrified with the Fame of his Power, and not
daring to trust each other in a <hi>joynt Defence,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
rather singly to make each one the best
Bargain for himself, by being the first that should
submit to the disproportionate force of the Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
But these Triumphs cost King <hi>Richard</hi> dear
in the sequel; for whilst he is thus engaged,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:99794:95"/>
and absent from his discontented Kingdom of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
the Duke of <hi>Lancaster</hi> thinks it the only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
time to put in execution what he and others
his Confederates had been consulting of: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
dispatching some of his trusty Emissaries over
to acquaint his Friends, and provide <hi>Arms</hi> and all
necessaries for his Arrival; He addresses himself
to the <hi>French King</hi> with a Complement, That he
intended to pay a Visit to his Kinsman <hi>John</hi> Duke
of <hi>Britain,</hi> and therefore desired his Majesties
Royal Letters of <hi>safe Conduct;</hi> which being gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
he there very privately levied a few Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
with whom, hiring three Ships of the Duke of
<hi>Britain,</hi> he put to Sea for <hi>England,</hi> accompanied
with the forementioned <hi>Arundel</hi> Archbishop of
<hi>Canterbury, Tho.</hi> Heir to <hi>Richard</hi> late Earl of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rundel,</hi>
the Lord <hi>Cobham,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Erpington,</hi>
and Sir <hi>Thomas Ramstone</hi> Knights, <hi>John Norbury,
Robert Waterton,</hi> and <hi>Francis Coynt</hi> Esquires, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
not in all above twenty Lances, and his whole
Retinue besides consisting not of above sixty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;
so that 'tis hard to judge which was the
greatest wonder, that he durst attempt, or that
he did succeed in the Conquest of a Kingdom,
with so inconsiderable a Company. But his Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
was not so much in the People he brought
with him, as in the strength he should find here,
relying altogether on the favour and assistance of
the people of the Realm, whom he knew to be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
male-contented, and eager to change their
present Governours for any that would but promise
them a Melioration of their Condition for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>Yet being wary not to push things on beyound
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:99794:96"/>
Possibility of a Retreat; As he did not presently
Land, but lay cruising up and down, sometimes
appearing on one Coast, and sometimes on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
that he might the better discover how the
Inclinations of the people stood, and what Forces
were ready either to receive or resist him, till at
last being satisfied therein, he put on shore with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any opposition about the biginning of <hi>June,</hi> at
<hi>Ravenspurre</hi> in <hi>Yorkshire;</hi> So did he not then make
any pretensions to the Crown, but gave out very
solemnly, that he came only to regain possession
of the Dutchy of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> and the rest of his
lawful Inheritance, which all the Nation knew
was wrongfully detained from him, and so were
the more ready to pity and favour him in a Cause
notoriously just, and against which there was no
objection.</p>
            <p>His Arrival was no sooner known, but there
repaired to him the Lords, <hi>Willoughby, Ross,
Darcy,</hi> and <hi>Beaumout,</hi> and shorly after at <hi>Don<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caster,</hi>
the Earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and his Son
Sir <hi>Henry Piercy,</hi> with the Earl of <hi>Westmorland,</hi>
and great numbers of the Gentry and common
people.</p>
            <p>Intelligence hereof being soon conveied to the
Duke of <hi>York,</hi> the Kings eldest Uncle, and with
whom during his absence he had intrusted the
Governance of the Realm: He calls together the
Bishop of <hi>Chichester</hi> Lord Chancellor, <hi>Scroop</hi> Earl
of <hi>Wiltshire</hi> Lord Treasurer, Sir <hi>John Bushy,</hi> Sir
<hi>Henry Green,</hi> Sir <hi>William Bagot,</hi> and Sir <hi>John
Russel,</hi> chief Favourites of the Kings Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
to consult what was to be done in this Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency
of Affairs. Amongst whom, whether de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signedly
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:99794:96"/>
by some, or ignorantly by others, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
say; but I am sure by all perniciously for King
<hi>Richards</hi> Interest; It was concluded to abandon
<hi>London,</hi> and appoint the Rendezvous for levying
Forces against the Duke at S. <hi>Albans.</hi> But when
the people out of sundry Counties were drawn
thither to be mustered, they declared, <hi>They
would not act any thing to the prejudice of the said
Duke,</hi> who they affirmed was unjustly expelled
his Country, and unlawfully kept from his Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
            <p>This Refusal of the Commons to serve, being
looked upon as a very <hi>ill Omen</hi> to the Kings Cause;
The Earl of <hi>Wiltshire,</hi> Sir <hi>John Bushy,</hi> Sir <hi>William
Bagot,</hi> and Sir <hi>Henry Green,</hi> forsook the Duke
of <hi>York,</hi> and fled to <hi>Bristol,</hi> intending to pass the
Seas into <hi>Ireland</hi> to the King: And time it was,
(especially for them) to take their Heels, for
these Four were those that were said to have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of the King his Kingdom to <hi>Farm,</hi> and on that
account and other Greivances and Oppressions,
which they had occasioned, were become so odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to the People, that their very presence turned
away many of the Subjects hearts from their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign,
it being the displeasure against them,
rather than any disatisfaction to the <hi>Kings Person,</hi>
that caused this general Revolt. The Duke of
<hi>York</hi> seeing their flight, and the Humour of the
Generality favouring <hi>Lancaster,</hi> and loath to run
the adventure of an improbable Resistance, gave
over the Cause, and thereupou the rest of the
Counsellors either openly declared for the said
Duke, or secretly held Correspondence with
hm, resolving to swim with the general Torrent,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:99794:97"/>
in hopes of greater safety thereby, than by stem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
that impetuous Tide which bore down all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it.</p>
            <p>For never did <hi>Snow-ball</hi> encrease so fast by rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
as the Duke of <hi>Lancaster</hi>'s Forces were aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
by his March, so that they were quickly
grown sixty thousand strong, and he resolving to
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ollow the <hi>Channel</hi> whilst the <hi>Current</hi> was fierce,
hastned with his Troops to <hi>London,</hi> that possessing
himself thereof, being the chief place within the
Kingdom for <hi>Strength</hi> and <hi>Store,</hi> he might best
there make the Seat of War, and be easiest ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated
both with <hi>Provision</hi> and <hi>Ammunition</hi>
In his whole March no Opposition was seen, no
Hostility shewn, but all along Gentlemen of the
best quality out of <hi>Affection</hi> or <hi>Fear,</hi> or hope of
<hi>Reward</hi> resorted to his Tents; and where ever he
stayed <hi>rich Presents</hi> were mad him, and his Army
supplyed with necessaries even to superfluity, and
particularly at <hi>London</hi> he was received with <hi>Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant
Pageants</hi> and <hi>Shews,</hi> solemn <hi>Processions</hi> of the
Clergy, and loud Acclamations of the People.</p>
            <p>But he was more regardful of his Affairs than
to stay long there, and therefore having fix'd the
Citizens firm to his Interest, and knowing all the
danger that could threaten him, must be from
King <hi>Richard</hi>'s return out of <hi>Ireland.</hi> To obviate
that, and overtake the fugitive Favourites, who
were fled to <hi>Bristol,</hi> he with speedy Marches pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued
them thither: where finding the Castle for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
against him, he assaults it so briskly, that in
Four daies time he forc'd it to a surrender, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
therein the Earl of <hi>Wiltshire</hi> Lord <hi>Treasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,</hi>
Sir <hi>John Bushy,</hi> and Sir <hi>Henry Green,</hi> he the
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:99794:97"/>
very next day Sacrificed them to the importunate
rage of the incensed People, causing them all
Three to be beheaded. But as for Sir <hi>William Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got,</hi>
he was got to <hi>Chester,</hi> and from thence shifting
over into <hi>Ireland,</hi> alone, escaped the present ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance;
This Execution, if it had not been just,
must yet be accounted Politick; for partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it was so grateful to the People, and partly
because it excluded all hope of the Kings Pardon;
It became a great ingagement to all the Dukes
followers, to adhere more firmly to him for the
future.</p>
            <p>The Duke had now been Six Weeks in <hi>England,</hi>
and the whole Land in effect had submitted to
him; during all which time, there was no news of
King <hi>Richard,</hi> whether it were that by reason of
contrary Winds he had no Intelligence, as some
write; or that on the first advice, he slighted it,
according to the Humour of some weak Spirits;
who contemn dangers remote, but are astonished
at them, when they approach too nigh; However,
at last upon certain news, in what an hazardous
condition his affairs stood, he caused the Sons of
the Dukes of <hi>Glocester,</hi> and <hi>Lancaster,</hi> to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned
in <hi>Trim Castle,</hi> and determined forthwith
for <hi>England;</hi> but the Duke of <hi>Aumerle</hi> his Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Counsellor, perswaded him to stay till all his
preparations were ready: Which fatal Council
it was King <hi>Richard</hi>'s ill Destiny to follow, yet
presently sent over the Earl of <hi>Salisbury</hi> to raise
him an Army in <hi>Wales</hi> and <hi>Cheshire</hi> against his
own coming, which he solemnly promised should
be withing six days at furthest. The Earl imployed
his pains so well that he had soon gotten together
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:99794:98"/>
Forty thousand men; but the six days and more
being elaps'd, and the King not appearing, made
them murmur and suspect he was dead, or come to
some disaster: but the Earl perswaded them to
have patience some few days longer, which being
likwise expired, and no tidings of him, they then
in discontent broke up and retired to their respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
homes.</p>
            <p>At length, eighteen days after he had sent away
the Earl, the King took Shipping attended with
<hi>Aumerl, Exeter, Surry,</hi> the Bishop of <hi>London,
Exeter,</hi> and <hi>Carlile,</hi> and others of the Nobility,
and landed in <hi>Wales,</hi> having about him a Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
number of <hi>Cheshire</hi> men: But when he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
that the other Forces he expected to joyn
with him were baulk'd and disbanded: that most
of his Fortresses from <hi>Scotland</hi> to <hi>Bristol,</hi> had sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred
to <hi>Lancaster;</hi> that the <hi>Londoners</hi> espou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
his Interest; that the greatest number of the
Nobility and Commons almost in general took
part with him; and especially that his <hi>principal
Councellors</hi> had lost their Heads at <hi>Bristol,</hi> he was
so far from retaining the <hi>Magnanimity of a King,</hi>
that he almost left off to be a <hi>Man,</hi> and totally
abandoned himself to <hi>despair.</hi> Perplext in uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties,
either where to stay, or whither to stir,
destitute both of Knowledge and Resolution in
himself for such amazing Difficulties, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious
to weak, wavering, and unfaithful <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels</hi>
from others; some advised him to march fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
into the Land, before those Forces he had
fell from him, alledging that Fortune seconds Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour:
That in all places he should find some, who
out of duty or affection, or for hire, would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:99794:98"/>
his Standard, which was illustrated with Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
and guarded with Right: Others perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
him to go back into <hi>Ireland,</hi> or over to his
Father-in-law of <hi>France,</hi> and thence to return
when the <hi>Paroxism</hi> was a little over, and himself
better strengthned. But the King unacquainted
with Marshal Affairs, rejected both <hi>Counsels,</hi> and
taking a <hi>middle course</hi> (which always in <hi>Extreams</hi>
of that kind is the worst) resolved to stay in <hi>Wales</hi>
to attend to what <hi>Head</hi> this <hi>Humour</hi> would rise.</p>
            <p>His Souldiers Endeavourd to encourage him
to venture a <hi>Battel,</hi> vowing they would live and
die with him; but this could not at all raise his
drooping Spirits, but in the Night he stole away
from his Army, and with the Dukes of <hi>Exeter</hi>
and <hi>Surry,</hi> The Bishop of <hi>Carlile,</hi> Sir <hi>Stephen
Scroop,</hi> and half a score more, retired to the Castle
of <hi>Conway,</hi> where the Earl of <hi>Worcester</hi> Steward of
His Majesties Houshold, seeing his Masters Affairs
in that desperate state, or to revenge the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming
of his Brother the Earl of <hi>Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
Traytor (as before was mentioned at the
Kings going for <hi>Ireland)</hi> did openly in the Hall
before all the Kings Servants break his <hi>white Staff
of Office,</hi> and forthwith repaired to the Duke of
<hi>Lancaster;</hi> and the rest of the <hi>Royal Retinue</hi> by his
Example scattered and shifted every one for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
Such <hi>Court-flies</hi> and treacherous Attendants
being but like <hi>Crows</hi> to a <hi>dead Carcass,</hi> who flock
to it, not to defend it, but to devour it; for no
sooner have they pickt off the flesh to the bones,
and find no more sustenance, but they are upon the
wing to be gone.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="188" facs="tcp:99794:99"/>
The Duke of <hi>Lancaster</hi> upon Advice of King
<hi>Richards</hi> Arrival out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> left the Duke
of <hi>York</hi> (who was now joyned with him) at <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stol,</hi>
and marched in the Head of his Troops to <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester,</hi>
then to <hi>Ross,</hi> afterwards to <hi>Hereford,</hi>
(where repaired to him the Bishop of that <hi>See,</hi>
and Sir <hi>Edmund Mortimer)</hi> on the <hi>Sunday</hi> following
he went to <hi>Leymster,</hi> and there the Lord <hi>Carleton</hi>
came to him, from thence he went to <hi>Ludlow,</hi> and
the next day to <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> and thither came to
him Sir <hi>Robert</hi> and Sir <hi>John Leigh,</hi> and other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of quality, being sent from <hi>Chester</hi> to offer
him their Service; as also the Lord <hi>Scales</hi> and the
Lord <hi>Bardolph</hi> out of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> he repaired to <hi>Chester,</hi> where
he dispatcht an <hi>Express</hi> into <hi>Ireland,</hi> to fetch over
his Son and Heir, and likewise the Duke of <hi>Gloce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi>'s
Son and Heir; both whom King <hi>Richard</hi> had
left in Custody there: but it seems their Keepers
durst no longer detain them after <hi>Lancaster</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
them thence, for his Son soon after arrived
here, but the other <hi>young Gentleman</hi> was unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
cast away at Sea.</p>
            <p>About this time, the King seeing himself so
beset and straitned, that he could neither <hi>Resist,</hi>
nor <hi>Escape,</hi> desired a Conference with the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop
of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland,</hi>
from whose Negotiation he could cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
hope for little good, since the one he had
formerly banisht, and proclaimed the other a
<hi>Traytor;</hi> however they upon safe Conduct com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to him, declared, That if it might please his
Majesty to promise that a <hi>Parliament should be
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:99794:99"/>
Assembled,</hi> and in the same <hi>Justice done,</hi> and the
Duke of <hi>Lancaster</hi> and his followers receive a
General Pardon, since what they had done was
for the publick Weal of the Realm; the Duke
would be ready to <hi>cast himself at his feet,</hi> and as
an humble Subject obey him in all dutiful
Services. But the King whether perceiving that
all this was but <hi>Complement,</hi> and thinking more to
oblige them by an early <hi>Voluntary offer</hi> of what
he saw he must be forc'd to part with; or whether
confounded in himself he grew weary of wearing
a Crown, that he was not able to support; requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
only that himself and eight more whom he
would name, might have an honourable Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
with Assurance of a private quiet Life, and
then he would <hi>Resign the Crown;</hi> which was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
condescended unto, and the King also desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to speak with the Duke, was removed to <hi>Flint
Castle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Soon after the Duke arriving there with his
Army, the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the Duke of
<hi>Aumerle,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Worcester,</hi> were sent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to the King, who spying them from the
Walls where he stood, went down to meet them,
and observing that they did their accustomed <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence</hi>
to him upon their knees, courteously took
them up, and had some private discourse with the
Archbishop.</p>
            <p>After a small space, the Duke of <hi>Lancaster</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
all Arm'd, approached the Castle, and being
within the first Gate, he there reposed himself,
till the King attended with the Bishop of <hi>Carlile,</hi>
the Earl of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> and Sir <hi>Stephen Scroop,</hi> who
bore the Sword before him, came forth and sate
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:99794:100"/>
down in a place prepared for him. As soon as
the Duke saw his Majesty, he came toward him
<hi>bowing his Knee,</hi> and advancing forward, did so a
second, and a third time, and then the King took
him by the hand and lift him up, saying,—<hi>Dear
Cousin, thou art welcome;</hi> the Duke humbly thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him, answered,—<hi>My Soveraign Lord and
King, the Cause of my coming at this present is (your
Honour saved) to have Restitution of my Person, my
Land and Inheritance.</hi> To which the King reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
—<hi>Dear Cousin, I am ready to accomplish your
will, so that you may enjoy all that is yours without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.</hi>
After this coming forth of the Castle,
the King called for <hi>Wine,</hi> and having drank, they
mounted and rod to <hi>Chester,</hi> and so by several Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
he was carried directly and with great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition
to <hi>London,</hi> and lodged on pretence of
<hi>State,</hi> but in truth for better security, in the <hi>Tower;</hi>
having not in all that Journey changed his Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel,
but wore only one Sute, and that but an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
one, whereas he was wont to be extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
profuse in his Cloaths, having one Coat
valued at <hi>Thirty thousand Marks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King yielded himself the Thirtieth day of
<hi>August,</hi> being but the Seven and fortieth day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Dukes Arrival in <hi>England,</hi> so that he might
well assume <hi>Caesars</hi> Motto, <hi>Veni, Vidi, Vici:</hi> For
considering his Marches from <hi>Holderness</hi> in the
<hi>North</hi> up to <hi>London,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Bristol,</hi>
and so into <hi>Wales,</hi> and back again to <hi>Chester;</hi> a
man can scarce travel over so much ground in the
space that he Conquered it: Nay so indulgent was
Fortune to him, that all the Kings Jewels and
Treasure (amounting as a late Author asserts, to
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:99794:100"/>
               <hi>Seven hundred thousand pounds)</hi> with his Horses and
Baggage fell into his hands.</p>
            <p>The King being thus safely lodg'd in the <hi>Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi>
the Duke of <hi>Lancaster</hi> (but in King <hi>Richards</hi>
Name) caused Writs to be issued forth for sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moning
and choosing a <hi>Parliament</hi> to be held at
<hi>Westminster</hi> on the last day of <hi>September</hi> following.
And in the mean time consults with his nearest
Kindred and Friends how to steer his Proceedings,
so as to bring his Affairs by prudence to a lucky
end, which had hitherto even beyond his hopes
been favoured by Fortune. In order to which, the
Duke of <hi>York,</hi> who but a little before had been Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
of the Realm for the King, but now his
the said <hi>Lancasters</hi> great Director, must be his
best <hi>Oracle,</hi> who after divers Debates proposed it
as very expedient, that King <hi>Richard</hi> should both
voluntarily Resign, and also be solemnly Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by the Estates of the Realm; For otherwise
Resignation would be imputed only to his Fear:
and Deprivation only to their Force, whereof the
one is always apt to move Pity, and the other stir
up Envy: But if both concur, and his desire be
combined with his deserts, being willing to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
that which he is adjudged worthy to forfeit,
then it will appear that he is neither expelled his
Kingdom by meer Constraint, nor leave it without
just Cause.</p>
            <p>This Advice was generally approved, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
pursued; a Solemn <hi>Renunciation</hi> being
tendred unto the King, and by him Signed on
<hi>Michaelmas</hi> Day then next following, being the
day before the <hi>Parliament</hi> was to meet. The <hi>Words

               <pb n="192" facs="tcp:99794:101"/>

And presently to the said Renunciation, and
Cession, the said King added by word of mouth,
<hi>That if it lay in his power, the said Duke of Lancaster
should succeed him in his Kingdom.</hi> But Because (as
he said,) this did not depend on his pleasure, he
did request the said Archbishop of <hi>York</hi> and Bishop
of <hi>Hereford,</hi> (whom he for that time had consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
his Procurators, to declare, and imitate such
his Cession and Renunciation to the States of the
Kingdom,) <hi>That they would be pleased to signify to
the People, his will and intention in that behalf.</hi> And
in token of such his will and intention, did then and
there, openly pluck off the Golden Ring of his sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,
from his own finger, and put it upon <hi>the finger
of the said Duke of Lancaster,</hi> desiring as he affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
that the same might be made known to all the
States of the Kingdom. Which being done, taking
their leaves on both sides they all went out of the
said Tower, to return to their Lodgings.</p>
            <p>But on the Morrow, viz. <hi>Tuesday</hi> the Feast of S.
<hi>Jereme,</hi> in the great Hall at <hi>Westminster,</hi> in the
place honourably prepared for holding the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the said Arch-bishops of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and
<hi>York,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> and other
Dukes, and Lords, as well Spiritual as Temporal,
whose names are under written, and the Commons
of the said Kingdom, Assembled in a great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
in Parliament, being present, and the said
Duke of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> being seated in a place, due to
his Quality, and the <hi>Chair of State</hi> [or Royal
Throne,] being solemnly adorn'd with Cloth of
Gold, but then empty, without any body presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
therein; the above named Archbishop of <hi>York,</hi>
in the name of himself, and of the said Bishop of
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:99794:104"/>
               <hi>Hereford,</hi> according to the order of the said King,
did publickly declare the Cession, and Renuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to have been so made by him as aforesaid, with
the subscription of his Royal Hand, and delivery
of his Signet. And the said Cession, and Renuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
did there cause to be ready by another, first in
<hi>Latin,</hi> and then in <hi>English.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Immediately after which, it was demanded of
the Estates and People their present, (to wit, first
of the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> to whom by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the dignity, and prerogative of his metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan
Church of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> it belongs in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half,
to have the first voice amongst the rest of the
Prelates, and Nobles of the Realm,) whether <hi>for
their interest and the utility of the Kingdom, they
would be pleased to admit such Renunciation, and Cessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
And the said States, and People, judging from
the Causes by the said king himself, in his Renun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation,
and Cession aforesaid, signified, that the
same was very expedient, did each man singly by
himself, and in Common with the People, unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously
Admit the said Cession, and Renunciation.</p>
            <p>After which Admission, it was then and there
publickly declared, that besides such Cession, and
Renunciation, so as aforesaid admitted, It would
be very expedient and profitable to the Kingdom,
for the removing of all Scruples, and taking away
sinister suspitions, That very many Crimes, and
Defects by the said King, (about the ill Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of his Kingdom) very often committed, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
into writing by way of Articles, by reason
of which (as himself affirmed in the Cession, by
him made) he was deservedly to be deposed,
should be publickly read, and declared to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:99794:105"/>
And so the greatest part of the said Articles
were then and there read through. The Tenour of
all which Articles is such.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>[But yet in the Roll before the Articles, there are
first these words,]</hi> Here followeth the form of the
Oath, used and accustomed to be taken by the
Kings of <hi>England</hi> at their Coronation: which the
Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> hath used to require and
receive from the said Kings, as in the Book of the
Pontifical Archbishops, and Bishops, more fully is
contained.</p>
            <p>Which Oath, <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, after the
Conquest of <hi>England,</hi> did take at his Coronation:
and the same was administred by the Archbishop of
<hi>Canterbury,</hi> and the very same Oath, the King af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
repeated, as in the Rolls of the <hi>Chancery,</hi>
may more fully be found of Record.</p>
            <p>Thou shall keep to the Church of God, and People,
Intire Peace and Concord in God, according to thy
power. <hi>The King shall answer,</hi> I will keep them.</p>
            <p>Thou shalt in all thy Judgements cause to be done, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
and right Justice, and discretion, in mercy, and in
Truth, according to thy power.—<hi>He shall answer,</hi>
I will do so.</p>
            <p>Thou dost grant the just Laws and Customes, as shall
be held, and dost promise the same shall by thee be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected,

of thy power.—<hi>He shall answer,</hi> I do so grant
and promise.</p>
            <p>To the aforesaid Questions, such others are added

THE

Against the King, touching his Deposition.</head>
                        <p>
                           <hi>IMprimis,</hi> It is objected against King <hi>Richard,</hi>
that whereas by reason of his ill Government,
<hi>viz.</hi> His giving away the Goods and Possessions
belonging to his Crown, and that to Persons un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy,
and his indiscreet squandering the same a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
otherwise, adn to that end, imposing without
cause Collections and other grievous burthens on
his People, more than they were able to bear, and
also innumerable other Evils by his assent and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
perpetrated, there were by the whole Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
certain Prelates, and others, Temporal
Lords, Elected and Assigned, who might with all
their power, and at their own Charges, faithfully
labour about the just Government of the Realm.
Yet the King causing a Conventicle to be held by
him, with his accomplices, the said Lords, as well
Spiritual, as Temporal, so occupied about the safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and profit of the Kingdom, did propose to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach
of High Treason; and did violently draw
the Judges of the Kingdom, for fear of Death, and
Corporal Tortures, to such his wicked purpose,
most vigorously striving to destroy the said Lords.</p>
                        <p>II. <hi>Item,</hi> The said King lately at <hi>Shr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>

several, and the greater part of the Judges, to
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:99794:106"/>
come before him and his Favourites privatly in a
Chamber, and by Menaces, and Various Terrors,
as such affrightments as might fall even upon men
of constant Resolutions, did induce, cause, and
compel them, severally to answer certain Questions
there propounded, on the behalf of the King;
concerning the Laws of his Kingdom, besides, and
against their will, and otherwise than they would
have answered, had they been at Liberty, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced.
By colour of which answers, the said King
purposed to have proceeded afterwards, to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of <hi>Thomas</hi> Duke of <hi>Glocester,</hi> and the Earls
of <hi>Arundel,</hi> and <hi>VVarwick,</hi> and other Lords, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
whose deeds and behaviour the said King
was much incensed, chiefly because they desired the
said King to be under good Guidance; But Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
withstanding it, by the resistance and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of the said Lords, the King was not able to
bring such his design to effect.</p>
                        <p>III. <hi>Item,</hi> When the Lords Temporal defending
themselves, had withstood his malice and fraud,
and the said King had prefix'd a day for holding his
Parliament to do them, and other Inhabitants of the
Realm, Justice in that behalf, and the said Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Lords, were quietly and peaceably gone home,
and at Rest in their houses, in hope and confidence
of the said Parliament, the King secretly sent the
Duke of <hi>Ireland</hi> with his Letters and Standard to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Chester,</hi> and there gathered multitudes in
Arms; and caused them to rise against the said
Lords, the Nobles of the Kingdom, and Servants
of the State, publickly erecting his Standard, against
the Peace which he had Sworn to keep. From
whence slaughters of men, Captivities, Dissentions,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:99794:106"/>
and other infinite mischiefs, did ensue throughout
the whole Kingdom, By which Act he became
Guilty of Perjury.</p>
                        <p>IV. <hi>Item,</hi> Although the said King had in full Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
and by the assent thereof, Pardoned the
said Duke of <hi>Glocester,</hi> and Earls of <hi>Arundel,</hi> and
<hi>Warwick,</hi> and all their Assistants, and others, all of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences,
and had for many years shown Signs of
Peace and Love, to the said Duke and Earls, and to
the rest appeared with a pleasant and benign
Countenance, Yet the said King always, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
bearing Gall in his Heart, did at last, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
an Opportunity, cause the said Duke of <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester,</hi>
the Uncle of him the said King, and also
the Son of <hi>Edward</hi> late King of <hi>England,</hi> of happy
memory, and Constable of <hi>England,</hi> then humbly
going to meet the said King, in solemn Procession;
and the said Earls of <hi>Arundel,</hi> and <hi>W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                                 <desc>•••</desc>
                              </gap>ick,</hi> to be
taken and Arrested; and him the said Duke out of
the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> to the Town of <hi>Callice</hi>
did cause to be led, and there imprisoned; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Custody of the Earl of <hi>Nottingham,</hi> (and
of the Appellors of the said Duke,) detained, and
without answer, or any lawful process whatsoever,
did inhumanely, and cruelly cause to be suffocated,
strangled, and <hi>murdered.</hi> And the Earl of <hi>Arun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del</hi>
though he pleaded as well the General Pardon,
as a Pardon afterwards to him specially granted,
and desired justice to be done him, yet in his Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
encompassed with armed men, and innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Archers of the People by him gathered to
that purpose by Pressing, did damnably cause to be
Beheaded. And the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> and Lord
<hi>Cobham,</hi> did commit to perpetual Imprisonment:
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:99794:107"/>
wickedly and against Justice, and the Laws of his
Kingdom and his express Oath, confiscating their
Lands and Tenements, as well Fee-simple, as Fee-tail,
from them and their Heirs, and giving the
same to their Appellors.</p>
                        <p>V. <hi>Item,</hi> At the same time, that the King in his
Parliament, caused the Duke of <hi>Glocester,</hi> and Earls
of <hi>Arundel,</hi> and <hi>Warwick,</hi> to be adjudged; that he
might more freely exercise his Cruelty upon them,
and accomplish his injurious will in other matters,
he gathered to himself a great multitude of Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors
of the County of <hi>Chester,</hi> of whom some
passing with the King through the Kingdom, as
well within the Kings Pallace, as without, did cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly
kill the Liege Subjects of the Kingdom, and
some they beat and wounded, and did plunder the
Goods of the People, and refuse to pay for their
Victuals, and did Ravish and Violate their Wives,
and other Women; and though their were grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
Complaints, of such their excesses brought
to the hearing of the said King; Yet the said King
did not regard to cause Justice to be done, or any
Remedy thereupon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>, but did favour the said
Troops in such their evil doings, trusting in them
and their Guard, against all others of his Kingdom;
for which cause, the faithful People of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
had great matter of Commotion, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation.</p>
                        <p>VI. <hi>Item,</hi> Although the said King by his writs,
caused Proclamation to be made throughout the
whole Kingdom, that he had caused his Uncle the
Duke of <hi>Glocester,</hi> and the Earls of <hi>Arundel</hi> and
<hi>Warwick,</hi> to be taken and Arrested, not for any As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblings
or Troopings by them, formerly made
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:99794:107"/>
within the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> but for very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Extortions, Oppressions, and other things by
them afterwards done, and perpetrated, against
his Royalty, and Kingly Majesty; And that it was
not his Intention, that any of the Family of the
said Duke, and Earls, or of their followers at the
time of such Assembling, and Trooping, should for
that occasion be molested, or aggrieved; Yet the
said King at last, in his Parliament, did not Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach
the said Lords for Extortions, Oppressions,
or any such matters, but for the Assemblings, and
Troopings aforesaid, did adjudge them to Death,
and very many of the Family of the said Lords, and
others, who were following them at the time of
such their Assembling, and Trooping, he did, for
fear of Death; force to make Fine and Ransom, as
Traytors, or Rebels, to the great destruction of a
great Number of his People. And so he did sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily,
fraudulently, and maliciously, deceive the said
Lords, and their familiars, and the People of his
Kingdom.</p>
                        <p>VII. <hi>Item,</hi> After very many of those Persons so
making Fine and Ransom, had obtained of the
King, his Letters Patent of full Pardon in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
they could not reap any Commodity by such
Letters of Pardon, till they had made new Fine,
and Ransoms, for saving of their Life, whereby
very many were Impoverished; which was a great
Derogation and dishonour to the Name and State
of a King.</p>
                        <p>VIII. <hi>Item,</hi> In the Last Parliament, held at <hi>Shrews<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi>
the said King purposing to oppress his People,
subtily procured and caused it to be granted, that
the <hi>power of the Parliament by the consent of the States
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:99794:108"/>
of his Kingdom, shall remain in certain Persons, to
determine (after the dissolution of the Parliament,)
certain Petitions in the said Parliament exhibited, but
then not dispatched.</hi> By Colour of which grant, the
Persons so deputed, proceeded to other things ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
touching that Parliament. And this with
the will of the King; in Derogation of the state
of Parliament, &amp; the great dammage of the whole
Kingdom, and pernitious Example. And that they
might seem to have some Colour and Authority,
for such their doings, the King called the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
Rolls to be altered and blotted at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
against the Effect of the said Grant.</p>
                        <p>IX. <hi>Item,</hi> Notwithstanding the said King in his
Coronation had sworn, <hi>that in all his Judgments,
he would cause to be done equal and right Justice, and
discretion, in mercy and truth, according to his power;</hi>
Yet the said King rigorously without all mercy did
(amongst other things) Ordain, under grievous pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties,
that none should sue for any favour, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercede
with the said King, for <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of
<hi>Lancaster,</hi> being Banished, whereby the said King
did act against the Bond of Charity, rashly viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
his Oath aforesaid.</p>
                        <p>X. <hi>Item,</hi> Although the Crown of the Kingdom of
<hi>England,</hi> and the Rights of the said Crown, and
that Kingdom it self, have in all time past been so
free, that our Lord the <hi>Pope,</hi> nor any other with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Kingdom, ought to concern himself about
the same; Yet the aforesaid King, for the Corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boration
of such his erroneous statutes, did make
supplication to our Lord the <hi>Pope,</hi> that he would
confirm the statutes ordained his last Parliament,
whereupon our Lord the King obtained the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolick
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:99794:108"/>
Letters,</hi> in which grievous Censures are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
against any that should presume in any
thing to act contrary to the said statutes; all
which are well known to tend against the Crown,
and Royal dignity, and against the Statutes and
Liberties of the said Kingdom.</p>
                        <p>XI. <hi>Item,</hi> Although the Lord <hi>Henry</hi> now Duke
of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> by the Kings Command had prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
his <hi>Bill</hi> touching the <hi>State and Honour of the
King,</hi> against the <hi>Duke of Norfolk,</hi> and the same
had duely prosecuted; so that according to the
Kings Order, he had exhibited himself in all
Points prepared for the <hi>Combate.</hi> And the said
King had declared, that the said Duke of <hi>Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi>
had honourably performed his <hi>Devoir,</hi> as much
as in him lay, and this by a <hi>Decree</hi> publickly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
before all the people Assembled at the said
<hi>Combate:</hi> Yet the said King without any Legal
Reason whatsoever, did cause and command the
said Duke to be Banisht for ten Years, against all
Justice, and Laws and Customs of his Kingdom,
and the Law of War in that behalf, thereby dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably
incurring Perjury.</p>
                        <p>XII. <hi>Item,</hi> After the said King had graciously
granted by his Letters Patents, to the Lord <hi>Henry</hi>
now Duke of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> that in his absence whilst
he was <hi>banisht,</hi> his General Attorneys might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute
for <hi>Livery</hi> to him to be made of all manner
of Inheritances or Successions belonging unto him,
and that his <hi>Homage</hi> should be respited, paying a
certain reasonable <hi>Fine;</hi> he injuriously did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
the said Letters Patent against the Laws of
the Land, thereby incurring the Crime of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="208" facs="tcp:99794:109"/>
XIII. <hi>Item,</hi> Notwithstanding that it was <hi>Enact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
that every Year the <hi>Officers</hi> of the King with
his Justices and others of the Kings Council, should
choose <hi>Sheriffs</hi> for all the Counties of <hi>England,</hi> and
name them to our Lord the King, according as
to their Discretion and Conscience should seem
expedient, for the good and utility of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
the said King hath caused persons to be
made Sheriffs, <hi>not so nominated or elected,</hi> but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
according to the <hi>Capricio's</hi> of his pleasure,
sometimes his <hi>Favourites</hi> or <hi>Creatures,</hi> and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
such as he knew would not oppose his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
for his own and others private advantage,
to the great <hi>grievance</hi> of his People, and against
the Laws of his Kingdom, thereby notoriously in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring
Perjury.</p>
                        <p>XIV. <hi>Item,</hi> At such time as the aforesaid King
requested and had of very many Lords and others
of his Kingdom, divers Sums of Money by way
of <hi>Loan,</hi> to be paid again at a certain term, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the said King faithfully promised by
his several Letters Patent to the several persons
of whom he borrowed the said Moneys, that at
the term limited as aforesaid, he would repay the
same, yet he did not fulfill such his Promise, nor
are they yet satisfied the said Moneys, whereby
such Creditors are much agrieved, and not only
they, but many others of the Kingdom repute
the King unfaithfull.</p>

XV. <hi>Item,</hi> Whereas the King of <hi>England</hi> by the
Revenue of his Kingdom, and the Patrimony be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to his <hi>Crown,</hi> is able to live honestly,
without the oppression of his People, as long as
the Kingdom is not burthen'd with the Charge of
<hi>Wars;</hi> yet the said King in a manner for his whole
time during the <hi>Truces</hi> between the Kingdom of
<hi>England</hi> and its Adversaries, hath not only given
away a great, yea indeed the greatest part of his
said Patrimony, and this to unworthy Persons:
But also hath further imposed on his Subjects so
many Burdens of Monies granted, as it were
every year of his Reign, that thereby he hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
and too excessively oppressed his People,
to the Impoverishment of his Kingdom; Not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
the Goods so levied to the Commodity
and profit of the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digally
squandering it away for the Ostentation of
his Name, and in Pomp and Vain-glory: Whilst
great Sums of Money are owing in his Kingdom
for the <hi>Victuals</hi> of his Houshould, and other things
bought, though he hath abounded with Riches
and Treasures more than any of his Progenitors.</p>
                        <p>XVI. <hi>Item,</hi> The said King not willing to keep
or Protect the just Laws and Customs of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
but according to his Arbitrary Will, to do
whatsoever should occur to his Desires, sometimes
and very often, when the Laws of his Kingdom
have been expounded and declared to him by the
Judges and others of his Council; and that they
have desired that he would do Justice according to
those Laws, hath expresly and with an angry and
haughty Countenance, said, <hi>That his Laws were in
his Mouth,</hi> and sometimes, <hi>That they were in his
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:99794:110"/>
Breast:</hi> And that <hi>he himself alone could make and
change the Laws of his Kingdom.</hi> And being sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
with that Opinion, did not suffer Justice to
be done to very many of his Leige People, but by
Threats and Terrors hath forced very many to
cease from the prosecution of Common Justice.</p>
                        <p>XVII. <hi>Item,</hi> That after certain Statutes had
been made in <hi>Parliament,</hi> which always bind, till
they are specially revok'd by the Authority of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
Parliament. The said King desiring to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
such Liberty that no such Statutes should so
bind him, but that he might do and execute his
pleasure, subtily procured a Petition to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
in his <hi>Parliament</hi> on the behalf of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalty</hi>
of his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and to be granted to him
in general, <hi>That he might be as free as any of his
Progenitors were before him:</hi> By colour of which
<hi>Petition</hi> and <hi>Concession</hi> the said <hi>King</hi> hath very
often commanded very many things to be done
against such Statutes unrepealed; acting therein
expresly and knowingly against his <hi>Oath</hi> taken in
his <hi>Coronation</hi> as aforesaid.</p>
                        <p>XVIII. <hi>Item,</hi> Although it was <hi>Enacted</hi> and <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained,</hi>
that no <hi>Sheriff</hi> should hold his <hi>Office</hi> above
<hi>one year</hi> together, but that three years should
pass, before he should be again admitted to that
<hi>Office:</hi> The said <hi>King Richard</hi> sometimes for his
own <hi>single Commodity,</hi> and sometimes at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of <hi>others,</hi> for their advantage, hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
and caused certain Sheriffs to stand and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
continually in their <hi>Offices,</hi> sometimes two,
sometimes three Years, against the Tenor and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of the Statute aforesaid, thereby incurring
<hi>Perjury;</hi> and this is notorious, publick, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
ill spoken of.</p>

XIX. <hi>Item,</hi> Although by the <hi>Statute<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>

                           </hi> and <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom</hi>
of his Realm in the calling together of every
<hi>Parliament,</hi> his People in several Countries of
the Kingdom, ought to be <hi>free</hi> in choosing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting
two Knights to be present in such Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for each respective County, and to declare
their Grievances, and to prosecute such <hi>Remedies</hi>
thereupon, as to them shall seem expedient. Yet
the aforesaid King, that in his Parliaments he
might be able more freely to accomplish the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of his head-strong will, did very often direct
his <hi>Command to his Sheriffs,</hi> that they should cause
to come to his Parliaments as Knights of the Shire,
certain Persons by the said King named; which
Knights being his Favourites he might lead, as
often as he has done, sometimes by various <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces</hi>
and <hi>Terrors,</hi> and sometimes by <hi>Gifts,</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to those things as were <hi>prejudicial</hi> to the
<hi>Kingdom,</hi> and exceeding burthensom to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
And especially to grant to the said <hi>King</hi> a
<hi>Subsidy</hi> on Wooll for the <hi>term of his Life,</hi> and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
<hi>Subsidy</hi> for certain Years, thereby too grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vously
oppressed his People.</p>
                        <p>XX. <hi>Item,</hi> the said <hi>King</hi> that he might more
freely fulfil and follow in every thing his own <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary
Will,</hi> did unlawfully cause and command,
That the <hi>Sheriffs</hi> throughout his whole Realm,
besides their ancient <hi>accustomed Oath,</hi> should <hi>swear</hi>
that they would <hi>obey his commands,</hi> as often as
they should be directed to them, under his Great
and Privy Seal, and also his Letters under his Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net.
And that in case the said Sheriffs could come
to know that any within their <hi>Bailiwicks</hi> of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
condition they were, had publickly or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:99794:111"/>
said or spoken any ill, that might tend to
the disgrace or scandal of his <hi>Royal Person,</hi> they
should Arrest and imprison them; there safely to
be kept till they should receive Command from
the King to the contrary, as may be found in the
Record; which Fact may probably tend to the
destruction of many of the Liege People to the said
Kingdom.</p>
                        <p>XXI. <hi>Item,</hi> The said <hi>King</hi> striving to trample
under foot his People, and subtily to acquire
their Goods to himself, that he might abound in
superfluous Riches, did cause the People of Seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
Counties of the Realm to submit themselves
to the <hi>King</hi> as <hi>Traitors,</hi> by Letters under their
Seals: By colour whereof he got mighty Sums of
Money to be granted him by the <hi>Clergy</hi> and <hi>People</hi>
of those Counties, for obtaining his Royal good
Will and Favour; And though to please the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
the King had caused those Obligatory Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
to be restored, yet the <hi>Procurators</hi> of the
People having full Power granted them to oblige
themselves and their Heirs to the said King; he
the said King caused them under their Seals to be
bound to him in the Name of the said People, and
so deceived his people, and Subtily extorted from
them their Goods.</p>
                        <p>XXII. <hi>Item,</hi> Although the said King in his
<hi>Cor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to the <hi>Arglicane Church,</hi> yet the said <hi>King</hi> by
reason of his Voyage into <hi>Ireland,</hi> did by his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
command very many <hi>Religious Persons,</hi> viz.
<hi>Abbots</hi> and <hi>Priors</hi> of his Kingdom, strictly requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
that some of them should send to him cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Horses,</hi> and some of them not only <hi>Horses,</hi>
                           <pb n="197" facs="tcp:99794:111"/>
but also <hi>Waggons</hi> and <hi>Carriages</hi> for his said Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
or in lieu thereof great Sums of Money in
the said Letters expressed: By which manner of
Writing he forced many of such <hi>Religious</hi> out of
fear to fulfil his Will and Command, whereby
they were heavily <hi>impoverisht</hi> and <hi>opprest</hi> in manifest
derogation of <hi>Ecclesiastical Liberty;</hi> by which
Pretext the said <hi>King Richard</hi> did incur <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>XXIII. <hi>Item,</hi> In most of the great Royal Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,
when the Lords of the Realm, the Judges
and others, being charg'd that they would faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
Council the <hi>King</hi> in Matters relating to his
<hi>State,</hi> and that of his <hi>Kingdom:</hi> The said Lords,
Justices, and others, very often in giving Counsel
according to their best Discretion, have been by
the <hi>King</hi> suddenly and so <hi>fiercely chidden</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved,</hi>
that they have not dared to speak the
Truth, in giving their Advice for the <hi>State</hi> of the
<hi>King</hi> and <hi>Kingdom.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>XXIV. <hi>Item,</hi> The <hi>Treasures, Crowns, Reliques,</hi>
and other <hi>Jewels,</hi> viz. <hi>The Goods of the Kingdom,</hi>
which time out of mind have been Reposited in
the Treasury of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> for the <hi>Honour</hi> of
the <hi>King,</hi> and preservation of his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> against
any sudden <hi>Event</hi> or <hi>Exigency;</hi> the said <hi>King</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out of his <hi>Kingdom</hi> into <hi>Ireland,</hi> did take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
and caused the same to be carried with him,
<hi>without the consent of the States of the Kingdom</hi>
Whereby this <hi>Kingdom</hi> had been vastly impove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risht,
if <hi>God</hi> by the retaking of the said Goods a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the said <hi>Kings</hi> Will, had not otherwise pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided.
And furthermore the said <hi>King</hi> did cause
<hi>the Rolls of Records</hi> touching the <hi>State</hi> and <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
                           <pb n="294" facs="tcp:99794:112"/>
of his <hi>Kingdom</hi> uo be <hi>destroyed</hi> and <hi>rased,</hi> to
the great prejudice of his People and disinheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the <hi>Crown</hi> of the said <hi>Kingdom:</hi> And all this,
as 'tis probably believed, in favour and support
of his <hi>evil Governance.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>XXV. <hi>Item,</hi> The said <hi>King</hi> was wont as it were
perpetually to be so variable and dissembling in
his Words and Writings, and so contrary to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
and especially in writing to the <hi>Pope,</hi> and to
<hi>Kings,</hi> and other Lords out of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and
within it, and also to others his Subjects, that <hi>no
man living</hi> that knew his Conditions could or
would <hi>confide</hi> in him; nay, he was reputed so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful
and unconstant, that it became <hi>scandalous</hi>
not only to his own person, but also to the whole
<hi>Kingdom,</hi> and especially amongst Foreigners of all
the World that came to know the same.</p>
                        <p>XXVI. <hi>Item,</hi> Although <hi>The Land and Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
the Goods and Chattels of every Freeman by
the Laws of the Realm used from all time heretofore,</hi>
ought not to be taken from him unless they be
<hi>forfeited:</hi> Yet the said <hi>King</hi> purposing and long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to weaken such Laws, in the pretence of very
many Lords and others of the commonalty of the
<hi>Kingdom,</hi> hath frequently said and affirmed—<hi>That
the Life of every one of his Svbjects, and his Lands,
Tenements, Goods, and Chattels, are his</hi> (the said
Kings) <hi>at his will and pleasure, without any forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi>
Which is utterly against the Laws and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms
of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> aforesaid.</p>
                        <p>XXVII. <hi>Item,</hi> Although it was Fnacted and
Ordained, and is hitherto Confirmed, <hi>That no
Freeman shall be taken,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>nor any way destroyed;
and that the King shall not pass, nor send any to pass
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:99794:112"/>
upon him, but by the Lawful Judgment of his Peers,
or by the Law of the Land:</hi> Yet by the Will, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
and Order of the said King, very many of
his Liege People being <hi>maliciously accused</hi> for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
publickly or secretly said something that
might tend to the disyraise, scandal, or disgrace
of the person of the said King, have been taken
and Imprisoned, and brought before the <hi>Consta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
and <hi>Marshal</hi> of <hi>England</hi> in the <hi>Court Military,</hi>
in which Court the said <hi>Liege People</hi> being accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
would not be admitted to make any other <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,</hi>
than that they were no way guilty, and
would justifie the same and defend themselves by
<hi>their Bodies,</hi> and not otherwise; notwithstanding
their <hi>Appellors</hi> were <hi>young men,</hi> stout and lusty,
and those so accused, <hi>antient, and impotent, maim'd
or infirm;</hi> Whereby not only destruction of the
<hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>grandees</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> but also of
all and singular persons of the Commonalty of the
same may probably ensue: Since therefore the
said King hath wilfully acted contrary to such a
<hi>Statute</hi> of his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> 'tis not to be doubted but
he hath thereby incurred the Crime of <hi>Perjury.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>XXVIII. <hi>Item,</hi> Although the People of the
<hi>Realm</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> by vertue of their <hi>Leigeance</hi> are
fully enough bound to their <hi>King,</hi> and the said
<hi>King</hi> by the <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Customs</hi> of his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> is
enabled to Correct and punish his People if in any
kind they <hi>Transgress;</hi> yet the said <hi>King</hi> desiring
to trample on, and too much oppress his People,
that he might the more freely execute and follow
the Humour of his <hi>foolish and unlawful Will,</hi> by
his <hi>Letters</hi> to all the <hi>Counties</hi> of his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> did

and which might probably cause the <hi>final destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>
of his People; and that they should confirm
such their <hi>Oaths</hi> under their Letters and Seals. To
which Royal Command, the People of his <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>
did submit and pay Obedience that they
might not incur his Indignation or Displeasure,
and also for fear of Death.</p>
                        <p>XXIX. <hi>Item,</hi> When Parties contending in the

Lords, desiring (as it hath appeared) that is Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
the Duke of <hi>Glocester,</hi> then there present,
should fully confide in the Good will of him the
said King, did voluntarily and of his own accord,
swear before the venerable Sacrament of the Lords
Body, there placed upon the Altar, that thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forwards
he would never <hi>endammage, trouble, or
grieve him,</hi> the said Duke of <hi>Glocester,</hi> for any of
his deeds which are said to have been committed
against the Person of him the said King; But did
cheerfully and totally forgive him all his offence if
any were. Yet afterwards, notwithstanding such
Oath, the said King did horribly and cruelly cause
the said Duke to be murdered, for such the before
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:99794:114"/>
pretended offences, thereby incurring the Guilt of
damnable Perjury.</p>
                        <p>XXXIII, <hi>Item,</hi> After one of the Knigots of the
<hi>Shires,</hi> of the said Kingdom, having a voice in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
had Impeached the said Lord <hi>Thomas,</hi>
Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> upon certain defaults,
committed against the <hi>Kings</hi> Majesty, as was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truely
suggested: And the said Archbishop, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
then and there offered himself ready to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
the matters charged upon him; and desired
that he might be thereunto admitted by the <hi>King,</hi>
not doubting as he said, but he shall be able, suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
to shew his Innocence; Yet the said King,
contriving by all the ways and means he could, to
oppress the said Bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and ruin his
Estate, (as the Event of the matter has declared)
speaking graciously, and with a cheerfull counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of the said Archbishop, from his Royal Seat,
did advise and very earnestly request him, that at
that time, he would hold his Peace, and expect a
better and more fit time to make his defence;
which day being passed, the said King from day
to day, for Five days or more, did fraudulently and
treacherously deceive the said Archbishop, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selling
him, and perswading him, that he would
not come to the Parliament, but wait at home
without any fear, because, as the said King faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
did promise him, there should not in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
any loss or prejudice be done or happen to
him. Notwithstanding all which, the said King in
his Parliament aforesaid, did in the mean time ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judge
the said Archbishop to be banished, during
the Kings pleasure, though absent, and never any
way called to answer, and without any resaonable
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:99794:115"/>
cause whatsoever; and also voluntarily against the
Laws of the Kingdom, and all Justice Confisca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
all his Goods, whereby he likewise became
Guilty of Perjury. But furthermore, the said
King being willing to Palliate his Malice and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty,
by flattering discourses which he oft-times
had with the said Arch-bishop, did endeavour to
clear himself of such injury done, and make as if
it were the doings of others; insomuch that the
Arch-bishop discoursing with the King, and with
the Duke of <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

men of the Kingdom, And happening to say by
way of Lamenting his own Condition, That he
was not the first that had suffered Banishment, nor
should he be the last; For he thought in a short
time the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and other Lords would
follow him, and confidently a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>erred to the King,
That all the Rigour of these Proceedings, would
finally be returned <hi>back on his own Head.</hi> To which
the said King as astonished incontinently replied,
<hi>that he verily thought it might so happen, and that he
himself might and indeed ought to be expell'd his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
by his Leige People.</hi> And further the King
said, that if the same should happen, <hi>He would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
himself to the same place, where the said Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
should be.</hi> And that the Archbishop might the
rather Credit his words, He shewed him a certain
great Jewel, <hi>[M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>nile,</hi> a <hi>Brooch</hi> or <hi>Tablet,]</hi> Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
formed, underneath the skirt of his outward
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>estment. Intimating for certain to the said Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop,
that when ever he should send that Jewel
for a Token, he would not delay to come thither,
where the said Arch-bishop should be resident:
And that the said Arch-bishop might more confide
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:99794:115"/>
in him; the said King sent to him, advising him,
that he should Privately send all his Jewels, and
other things of value, belonging to his Chappel,
unto him the said King; For the safe keeping
thereof, lest by colour of the before mentioned
Judgment, any one should wrongfully seize the
same. Which under the greatest confidence in the
World being done, the said King caused him to
reposite the said Goods in certain <hi>Coffers:</hi> and the
said <hi>Coffers</hi> to be locked up, and sealed by one of the
Archbishops Clerks, and keeping the said <hi>Coffers</hi>
by him, returned the Keys thereof by the said
Clerk to the Archbishop. Yet afterwards unknown
to the said Archbishop, caused the said <hi>Coffers</hi> to be
broken open, and disposed of the goods there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
at his will and pleasure. Furthermore the said
King faithfully promised the said Archbishop, that
if he would but repair to the Port of <hi>Hampton,</hi> in
order to go out of the Realm, he would at least by
the Intercession of the Queen, get him Recalled.
And if it should happen, that he the said Archbishop
should go out of the Realm, he should without fail
return into <hi>England,</hi> before <hi>Easter</hi> next following
nor should in any kind lose his Archbishoprick:
And this he faithfully promised, swearing upon the
Cross of the late Martyr S. <hi>Thomas,</hi> Archbishop of
<hi>Canterbury,</hi> by him the said King, corporally tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched;
all which promises notwithstanding, the said
King forced the said Archbishop to depart the
Realm: And forthwith transmitted special Letters
to the Apostolical See, to have him Translated.
And so, and by other Frauds, and deceitful Tricks
of the said King, the said Archbishop being a
well-meaning believing man, was subtily circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented.</p>

AND because it seemed to all the Estates of the
Realm, being asked their Judgments thereupon, as
well severally as jointly, That these causes of
Crimes and Defaults were sufficient and notorious
to depose the said King; Considering also his own
Confession of his insufficiency and other things
contained in his said Renunciation and Cession, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly
delivered, all the said States did unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously
consent, that <hi>ex abundanti,</hi> that they should
proceed unto a Deposition of the said King; for
the great security, and tranquillity of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,

said States and Commons unanimously constituted,

the Authority of all the said States, as in like
Cases, from the Antient Custom of the said King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom

Commissioners taking upon themselves, the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then

had some debate of the matter, did on the behalf

the said Sentence of Deposition, being reduced into

the said Kingdom; Representing all Estates
(or Conditions) of the said Realm, sitting in
Tribunal, and having considered the multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Perjuries, Cruelty, and very many other
Crimes of the said <hi>Richard,</hi> touching his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
conmitted and perpetrated in his
Kingdomes and Dominions aforesaid, during
the time of his Governance; and before the said
States openly and publickly propounded, exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,

publick, notorious, manifest, and scandalous, that
they could not nor can be concealed with deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al

of the said <hi>Richard,</hi> acknowledging

knowledge, judging himself to have been and
to be utterly insufficient and unmeet for the
rule and Government of the said Kingdoms and
Dominions, and their Appurtenances, and for
such his notorious demerits, worthy to be depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,

as by him the said <hi>Richard,</hi> was before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,

to us in this matter committed, <hi>ex abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danti,</hi>
and for Caution Pronounce, decree and
declare him the said <hi>Richard,</hi> to have been,
and to be unfit, unable, and utterly in sufficient
for, and unworthy of, the Rule and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the said Kingdoms, and the Dominion,
and Rights, and Appurtenances of the same,
and for any by reason of the Premisses, to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servedly
deposed of, and from all Royal Dignity
and Honour, if any thing of such Dignity and
Honour were yet remaining in him. And with
the same Caution we do Depose him by this our
deffinitive sentence in writing; Expresly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding
all and singular the <hi>Lords, Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,

Furthermore the said States willing that nothing
should be wanting which might be of value, or
ought to be required touching the Premisses, being
severally interrogated thereupon, did constitute
the same Persons that were before nominated
Commissioners, to be their Procurators, joyntly
and severally to resign and give back to the said
King <hi>Richard,</hi> the <hi>Homage</hi> and <hi>Fealty</hi> to him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
made, and to intimate to him, if it should
be requisite, all the Premises, touching such his
Deposition and Renunciation.</p>
            <p>And then presently, as soon as it appeared by
the Premises, and the occasion of them, That the
Crown of <hi>England,</hi> with its Appurtenances was
vacant, the aforesaid <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaster</hi> ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
up from his place, and standing so erected as he
might conveniently be seen by the People, and
humbly fortifying himself with the Sign of the
Cross on his Forehead, and on his Breast, having
also first called upon the name of Christ, did claim
the said Kingdom so vacant as aforesaid, with its
Crown and all its Members and Appurtenances; In

as the said King shewed to the States of the
Kingdom, the Signet of King <hi>Richard,</hi> delivered
to him as a token of his will, that he should succeed
him as aforesaid, the said Archbishop taking the
said King <hi>Henry</hi> by the Right Hand, led him to the
Royal Chair of State: And after the said King
kneeling down before it, had prayed a little while,
the said Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> assisted by the
Archbishop of <hi>York,</hi> did place the said King, and
cause him to sit in the said Royal Seat; All the
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:99794:118"/>
people wonderfully shouting for joy, and by and by
the said Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> having with
much ado, procured silence from the over joy'd
multitude, made a short discourse, or Oration in
these words.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Vir Dominabitur populo,</hi> A man shall
Reign over my people, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9. 17. These are
the words of the King of Kings speaking to <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel,</hi>
and teaching him how a person should be
qualified to Rule, since the people desired to
have a <hi>King</hi> given. And not unfitly may they
be said of our Lord the King whom we behold
this day, and if we but intimately consider
these words, they afford us matter of great
Consolation; for God does not threaten us as he
did formerly his people by <hi>Isaiah,</hi> saying, <hi>Isa. 3.
I will make Children to rule over them;</hi>
But according to his Compassion, who in his
wrath remembreth mercy, he hath visited his
people, and now no more Children (as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore)
shall Lord it over them. For the Lord
saith to them, <hi>A man shall Rule:</hi> Of the late
Rulers of this Kingdom, or any of them, one
might have fitly said that of the Apostle, <hi>Cor.

By which Fiction they drew together a considerable
Army and such as might have shockt King <hi>Henry</hi>'s
scarce-well-setled Crown, had not Fortune (always
his Friend) scattered them in a moment by the most
unexpected accident in the World. For their
Troops being encamped near <hi>Cicester,</hi> and the
Duke of <hi>Surrey,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> taking
their Quarters within the Town at one end, and
the Duke of <hi>Exeter,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Glocester,</hi> in
another: The Bayliff of the Town (I am sorry
his Name is not recorded, for a stout brave fellow
no doubt he was, that durst attack such mighty
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:99794:124"/>
Peers, that had so numerous an Army within a
Mile or two of the Town) understanding that
they were in Rebellion against the King, gathering
a Company of Townsmen in the night, assaulted
the Inn where <hi>Surrey</hi> and <hi>Salisbury</hi> lay, who after
a long defence, being in danger of being taken, a
Priest of their Party set divers Houses in the
Town on Fire, hoping thereby to divert the Assai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants
from prosecuting the Lords, to save their
Houses. But this enflam'd them the more, &amp; so hotly
they pursued the Skirmish, that they slew the said
two Noblemen, and cut off their Heads. In the mean
time from the other Inn, <hi>Exeter</hi> fled to his Camp,
intending to bring the whole Army to rescue his
Friends: But the Soldiers having heard a Clamour,
and seeing the Town on Fire, imagined King <hi>Henry</hi>
had been come with all his Forces and so in a pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick
fear fled and dispersed themselves; and the
said Duke of <hi>Exeter</hi> having skulk'd up and down
for some time, was taken and Beheaded at <hi>Plashey</hi>

cannot be supposed to have much hand in this
<hi>Insurrection,</hi> yet being undertaken for his sake, it
