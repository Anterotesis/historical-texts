            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE STATE of the CASE RELATING <hi>To Sir</hi> John Turton's <hi>Leaſe of</hi> Heyling's-Park, <hi>and</hi> Ruffey-Park, <hi>within the Foreſt of</hi> Needwood.</head>
            <p>BY Act of Parliament, made in the Seventh and Eighth Years of his preſent Majeſty, the Honour of <hi>Tutbury, Forest</hi> of <hi>Needwood,</hi> and ſeveral Parks, Mannors, Lands and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits thereunto belonging, which had been granted away by King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, are reveſted in the Crown, under a Proviſo, in theſe Words following, That the Honor of <hi>Tedbury,</hi> Foreſt of <hi>Needwood,</hi> ſeveral Parks, Mannors, Lands and other Profits, thereunto belonging, and by this Act mention'd to be reveſted in the Crown, ſhall not at any time hereafter be aliened from the Crown of this Realm, by his Majeſty or any his Heirs or Succeſſors without conſent of Parliament, and that all ſuch alienation of the ſame to any Perſon or Perſons, ſhall be, and is hereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared Null and void to all Intents and Purpoſes whatſoever.</p>
            <p>By the ſame Act a Debt of 3300 <hi>l.</hi> with Intereſt from the 3<hi>d</hi> of <hi>February</hi> 1688, wherewith the Premiſes were before chargable, is appointed to be paid by Wood, to be felled within the Foreſt of <hi>Needwood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir <hi>John Turton,</hi> one of the Juſtices of the King's-Bench, who adviſed the Act of Parliament, hath notwithſtanding the ſaid Act, in <hi>July</hi> 1698, upon no other Conſideration than his Services, procured a Grant to himſelf, from his Majeſty, of the Woods in <hi>Heyling-Park,</hi> and <hi>Ruffey-Park,</hi> within <hi>Needwood-Foreſt.</hi> and a Leaſe for 99 Years, of the Soil of both, with liberty to diſpark and Plough up the ſame, under the yearly Rent of 4 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> for <hi>Ruffey-Park,</hi> and 1 <hi>l.</hi> 6 <hi>s.</hi> 8 <hi>d. per Annum</hi> for <hi>Heyling's-Park,</hi> and has ſince impal'd <hi>Heyling's-Park,</hi> with the Kings Timber, for his own private uſe, and ſtocked the ſame with a great number of Deer.</p>
            <p>This Grant is contrary to the intent of the Act of Parliament, and to the prejudice of the Crown, the Foreſt, and all Freeholders bordering thereon, or claiming Eſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers there, for theſe Reaſons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The ancient Rent to the King for the Herbage only of <hi>Heyling's-Park,</hi> was 3 <hi>l.</hi> 6 <hi>s.</hi> 8 <hi>d.</hi> and in this Leaſe no more then 1 <hi>l.</hi> 6 <hi>s.</hi> 8 <hi>d.</hi> is reſerved.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Kings Deer are excluded from part of their Paſture.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Royalties and Intereſt which were intended by the Act to be preſerved entire in the Crown, are divided, and put into private Hands</p>
            <p n="4">4. The King's Deer being excluded from part of their Range, will be more apt to break into the Lands bordering upon the Foreſt than before, and injure the Neighbouring Eſtates.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The Woods within theſe Parks, which alone, without the Soil, were formerly valued by the King's Surveyor at 1568 <hi>l.</hi> 5 <hi>s.</hi> and might have been applied towards payment of the 3300 <hi>l</hi> Debt, are now converted to Sir <hi>John Turton</hi>'s private uſe, whereby greater quantities of Wood muſt be felled within the Foreſt for ſatisfying this Debt, than there would otherwiſe have been. And the Eſtovers claimed by the Freeholders in that Foreſt, muſt thereby be leſſened.</p>
            <p n="6">6. This Act was made to prevent the King and Subject claiming right in the Foreſt, from being befrauded or injured by Grants obtained upon falſe Suggeſtions; and this Leaſe for 99 Years, has all the ſame miſcheifs in it as an alienation in Fee, and ſeems to be a manifeſt evaſion of the true meaning of the ſaid Act of Parliament. For the Trees are granted away wholly, and the Soil with liberty to grub up and Plough it during the Term, which beſides the leſſening of the Rent, takes away all profit from the King or Subject, and renders the Reverſion of no value. And if a Leaſe for 99 Years may be granted, a Leaſe of 1000, 2000, or 10000 may by the ſame reaſon be granted, and yet be no alienation againſt the Act of Parliament.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is humbly hop'd that this Leaſe ſhall be vacated</hi>
