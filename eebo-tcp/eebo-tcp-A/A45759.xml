         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Left for a Farewell to his Native Country, by that zealous publick-hearted and learned Gentleman <hi>Thomas Brown</hi> Dr. in Divinity, and of the Civill Law.</head>
                     <p>IT is clear from many good Authors, that the Ancients made a constant Revenue of their Bees without killing them at any time, and that this so profitable Government of Bees is now utterly lost, is too much apparent from the common practise of all Nations at this day, who generally kill the Bees to take the Honey. If by any conjecture or comparing one thing with another, we may be able to find out a meanes to preserve Bees,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:118800:6"/>
and yet receive a constant and liberall benefit by them, is the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of this following Discourse.</p>
                     <p>Although the History of Bees hath been largely handled, even to curiosity, yet the principal part of it, concerning their Preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, so as to raise a constant Revenue by them, hath not been so clearly set down, as the importance thereof deserveth, seeing that hereupon dependeth the whole businesse of a Bee-master; f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>r from the multitude of Bees commeth the great increase of Honey, and the plenty of Honey is the chief Meanes to increase your Bees, which we shall easily and certainly doe, if we rightly understand and practise the naturall way of ordering them. This task at your intreaty I have adventured upon, whether I have performed it so fully and clearly as I seem to my self to understand it, the successe will judge.</p>
                     <p>For the preserving of Bees then, it is of absolute necessity, that they be abundantly provided of food, which in Summer your Garden and the neighbouring Fields must afford, for the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they will furnish themselves; also that they be largely, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently, and cleanly housed, which two things rightly practised will perform what we desire.</p>
                     <p>I take it for a certain truth, that Bees doe never forsake the place of their breeding, so long as it is cleanly and large enough for them, and that accordingly in greatest company they prosper best, as frequent experience proveth, in such places, where they have chosen themselves dwellings in the bodies of great hollow trees, in which have been found combs full of Honey wrought down six or eight foot long, as also between the beames and floonings of houses with the like increase, which in all probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity could not be done by the labour of any one swarm, though of the greatest numbers, so that of necessity there must have been the increase of some yeares Bees, to bring together so great a masse of Honey, and it is truly observed, that the old and young Bees doe live quietly in the same Hive, as did the families in the old world, renewing themselves from year to year. If I shall shew you the way to accomplish this, I have done what I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took; upon these two Maximes lieth the foundation of all I have to say, that Bees will not leave their place of breeding, but for want of room, or some annoiance by noise or ill smells: that in
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:118800:6"/>
all their workings they move downwards, if the place hinder them not. According to these two Rules, your onely care is, to make your Hives of such a fashion, as doth naturally and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily agree with, and help forward this design, and this can be no other than flat, as well at the top, as at the bottome, both ends of an equall breadth to a hair, in all the Hives you make, so that they may be easily set one upon another, as many as you shall see necessary for your purpose, though in some places they make them square of four boards, yet because the round Figure is the most perfect. I rather choose it. For the right making of your Hives, I shall shew you their materials, proportion, order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and placing; and lastly their use and benefit. You may make them, and that will be the best, of such empty Cask, as hath had in it Honey, Muskadine, Canarie, or Malaga wine, according as you have opportunitie, because these vessels, being already so well seasoned, will not easily loose their savour, and will the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter invite the Bees, both to come, and to remain in them.</p>
                     <p>For their Proportion I would have A. B. every Hive to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a just bushell within the work, the breadth of it to be a third part more than the height, that so it may stand the surer headed, but at one end, which must be C. the upper part of it, in the midst of that head, a round hole D. three or four inches wide, made very smooth, the Hives A. B. must be all of a widenesse from the top to the bottome, otherwise the Combs will not come out without breaking; six E. broad hoops will be sufficient, two in the midst, and two at each end, the lowest hoop must be set a large inch from the end of the vessell, leaving so much of it bare, which part must be exceeding smooth and strong, which bare place F. should be covered with a very thin hoop of Iron or brasse for its greater strength, and on the fore side of it, three in the midst for the great Bees, and six smaller on each side for the lesser, for there, and there onely it may receive offence, the uppermost hoop must be somewhat stronger and broader than the rest by a full inch, and so set on that it may stand out a full inch further than the end of the vessell, thereby leaving sufficient and fit space to set the lower part F. of another vessel fast into it as into a box, so close, that no air can come in, that it may not be moved.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="6" facs="tcp:118800:7"/>And because Bees cannot conveniently work in such a void space without some support for their combs, the fittest that I can think on, may be made in imitation of such frames, as Gardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners use for their Gillifloures, composed of three or four very small hoops, and as many side posts of Fir, with some crosse barres at the top, and in the middle to stay the Combs, and that these may not be shaken nor moved, in the bare space at the bottom of the vessell, bore two holes, one opposite to the other, through the vessell and the frame, and so fasten them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>And for the more easie and safe removing of your Hives, either to see in what estate they be, or to take away such as be full of Honey and empty of Bees, you must set upon every Hive two G. such iron handles as are usually upon bushels, and so you may command them at your pleasure. And for the great hole D. in the top of the Hive, you must make a cover H. with a shoulder and a handle, to stop it so close, that no air may come in. Your Hives A. B. being thus I. C. D. E. K. G. H. made, you must order them as followeth. I will suppose you have at least A. one Hive of old Bees, at the beginning of the year, take B. one of your new Hives, and sweeten both it and the frame very curiously, and fasten them together, set this Hive B. where you mean your Bees shall stand, leaving the hole D. at the top open, then take A. your old Hive of Bees, and cut away the skirts of it, as much as conveniently you may, to the very Combs, the neerer the better, and make a new door to it, and set it upon B. the new Hive, within the compasse of E. the hoop. And because in the Bees working down into the lower Hive, it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that the Combs of the two Hives will hang together, and so be troublesome to part them, to prevent this inconvenience, lay a false bottom, with a hole in it, upon the top of the lower Hive, close to the top of the lower Hive, and make it fast.</p>
                     <p>Your Hives being thus placed, your Bees, either for the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in the new Hive B. or for want of room in the old, will make all haste to work down into B. the new, and so in a short time leave A. the old full of Honey and empty of Bees, both the old stock, and their increase, going down, working and abiding in B. the new Hive, whereby you shall have opportunity, when
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:118800:7"/>
you see it most convenient, to take away the upper Hive full of Honey, without the least trouble to the Bees, or to your self.</p>
                     <p>When you have taken away A. the upper Hive, set on the cover H. upon the hole in the lower Hive B. so close that no air may come in, and then set another new empty Hive, and a false bottom upon it, as before, sweetned and prepared under it, expecting a fit time when the upper Hive shall be full<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> and the Bees gone down into this B. B. lower Hive, to take it away as you did the former, and so from time to time as long as the gathering season lasteth, but not towards winter. If your Bees increase plentifully, it will be necessary to have three Hives one upon another, that so the Bees may have room enough for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and their swarmes, if you see cause, you may adventure to four, but never higher, which number when you have happily attained, you shall set a new Hive well prepared and sweetned, as neer I. the mouth of the lowest Hive, as you can conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, putting into it some Honey-comb, or other sweet things, and raising it on the side half an inch or more, that the Bees walking up and down may find a new dwelling ready for them, and at their next swa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The use and Benefit of all that hath been said is, that your Bees shall alwayes be provided of a sweet dwelling, large enough for themselves and their increase, and whereby they shall easily be kept together, also of such plenty of food, that when others starve they shall be alwayes strong, both Summer and Winter, whereby in all probability, by Gods blessing, and your own mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate care, you shall have multitudes of Bees, and consequently abundance of Honey.</p>

                     <p>SIR, Being much indebted to you for the gift of your Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and other choice pieces, and understanding that you are about another of the like nature, which you intend to publish. I thought good in the mean time (till occasion prompt some other meanes to serve you) to impart unto you this notable Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, which I had from an old <hi>Germane</hi> Captain concerning Bees, that by long experience the Planting of Anise neer them proved the best meanes for multiplying and keeping of them, as also for their breeding of great store of Honey. That the Hearb being taken, and the inside of the Hives rubbed therewith, causeth great multitudes of Bees to etner, and become close retainers to those Hives, which ought to be placed directly against the Sun, so that the Sun beames fall just into the Orifices of them. That the feeding upon this plant will cause each Stock to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gender and thrust out three young ones in one year, within which space they doe else not nse to doe so above once. That against the time of their thrusting forth, other Hives ought to be placed next to those from whence they thrust forth, which, as also the way leading to the Orifices, are to be rubbed with the Anise in such sort, that the juyce of the Hearb may come forth and stick thereunto, and the young Stocks that come forth from the old, will certainly enter into those, and not repair any where else. But in case that upon the neglect any be swarved
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:118800:9"/>
forth, and settled unto some tree, the fault may be amended by rubbing the inside of the new Hive with Anise, and holding it on the top of a long pearch unto the Bees, who will enter there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into of themselves as soon as they scent the sweetnesse of the Anise.</p>
                     <p>The abovesaid Captain related, that a Baron in <hi>Austria</hi> so thrived by this secret, that he furnished many Countries with Honey and Wax, and thereby abundantly increaseth his wealth and revenue. This I thought to hand unto the publick by your meanes, resting</p>

                     <head>A Translate of a Letter written in High-Dutch, communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a Secret for the better ordering and preserving of Bees, practised beyond the Seas.</head>
                     <p>SIR, I give you many thanks for that direction about Bees, but I cannot perceive, how by that way we may prevent their swarming, or the trouble of hiving them. Nor doth that way avoid the vulgar errour of destroying the best Bees for their Honey.</p>
                     <p>To remedy all these and many other inconveniences, I have formerly sought an unusuall way, and in practise have found it good and profitable.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="13" facs="tcp:118800:10"/>I caused Hives of glasse to be made, and covered them with wood; in which Covers I made windowes to be opened when I list, which served me for the better considering of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but afforded me no help in the foresaid inconvenience, for such I account them, though I see your man be of a contrary opinion, speaking of often swarming, as a thing very advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous. It is true, the more swarmes you have, the greater is the number of Hives in your Bee-garden, but the stocks are so much the weaker, especially every metropolitan stock, out of which his three or four Swarmes issued: which consideration gave occasion to that precept, given heretofore by experienced Bee-masters, not to suffer any stock to swarm above twice in a year, but rather to prevent it, by giving the Bees more room, which is done by setting the Bee-hive some inches higher from the bench or stool upon which they stand.</p>
                     <p>That swarming weakeneth the first stocks, is manifest to any one that considereth, that for the production and breeding of the young Bees, there is in every Hive a great number of atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, somewhat larger than the Bees (we call them Drones) which are fed by the labours of the Bees, as long as they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for swarming; but as soon as the Bees resolve to send-out no more Colonies, they fall upon the Drones and kill them. The young Bees are also kept idle till their General be ready, and the whole Army be fit to march out all together for a new plantation. The oftner that such swarmes issue out of a stock of Bees, the more is the dammage and charge that it suffers from these Drones and young Bees: All which cost and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges are spared in my way, so that my Bees never intending to swarme, had so much the more provision for bad weather and winter, and did so much the sooner set their young ones to work for themselves, and to earn their own meat, as having no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to be kept idle,</p>
                     <p>Secondly, In the common way it is so hard to keep Bees from flying away in swarming time, that the most diligent watchers of them doe now and then lose a Swarm: But in my way of ordering them such watching is unnecessary; for my Bees ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fly away, because I prevent all occasions of swarming: By which meanes they are also kept from breeding of Drones, and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:118800:10"/>
new Master-Bees, or Generals; and their young Bees, as soon as they can fly, are set to work among their Elders.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, I never needed to kill any of my Bees, and yet I could share with them in the Honey. It was not unusuall with me to make a whole barrel of Honey and Wax out of one Stock or Hive. And besides all these conveniences, my Bees were farre better secured and defended from excessive heat and cold, from vermine, theeves, and all other their troublers and enemies. They had also this accommodation, that when they were laden they went downward, but clambered upward when they were unladen, whereas the contrary is necessary in the common-way.</p>
                     <p>I make no question, but that by this time you long to hear what course I took with them; nor shall I be nice in communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating it, though it cost me above two hundred Rix dollers. But if you were here, I could farre more easily shew it, than I can now find words to expresse it well in writing especially thus in a Letter.</p>
                     <p>My Bee-hives did not stand upright after the usual manner, but lay upon two long poles or railes within my house, in a Garret, close under the Roof, where the Bees could creep in and out under the tiles. The close end of the Hive touched the tiles of the roof. In the upper part of each Hive I did cut a hole for the Bees to goe in and out. The wide end of the Hive com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly stands clapt down upon some plank, but in mine it was shut up with a bottom made of straw, pinned to it on every side with wooden skewets. And by the like meanes I could adjoyn straw-hoops of what breadth I pleased, and so lengthen any of my Hives as often as need was, so that they never swarmed, though their number increased so much, that by several additions a Hive became two or three yards long.</p>
                     <p>The way of taking their Honey from them was thus; I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinned the wide end of a Hive, and by burning linnen rags I smoaked up the Bees thence toward the close end of the Hive; and then I might freely take away the prolongers or additional hoops one after another, till I thought the Bees could not well spare any more Honey.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="14" facs="tcp:118800:11"/>This slight description may make it seem a small matter to those that consider not, that all the aforesaid conveniences will undoubtedly follow it.</p>
                     <p>Hereafter I may perhaps expresse it more fully, when I have more leisure to write; especially if my affairs would permit me to come to you to confer at large of this, &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>SIR, I here send you the description of my long Bee-hives expressed in picture: Wherein (A) is a common Bee-hive,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:118800:11"/>
not standing, as the usuall manner is, but laid along upon one side. In the upper part of the Hive I cut a round or four cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerd hole, through which the Bees may passe in and out, here marked with C. In the placing of the Hive you may turn that hole downward if you will, but I turn it alwayes upward, that the Bees, when they are laden, may rather goe downward than up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. Besides, if I turn it not upwards I cannot well set it close to any hole, left for the Bees entrance, under the tiles in the roof of a Garret, which is a farre surer way than after the usuall manner, to leave them in a Garden, exposed to theeves, vermin, and distempers of weather. Where the roof is inconvenient, I use to make a hole in the upright wall of a Garret, and set the Hive close up against the wall, with a hole in its head precisely answering to that hole in the wall.</p>
                     <p>The open end I shut up with a bottom made of straw, as you see represented at D, which may be opened easily, and yet shuts close and firm by the help of those wooden pins here marked with E.</p>
                     <p>When I perceive that my Bees have neer filled their Hive, I take off that Shutter D, and set on a Prolonger, like the Hive, but that it hath no head, such as are here marked with B, and then shut it up, as before, with that straw door D. Thus I may add as many Continuators as I please, shutting close up to one another, alwayes closing the last with D</p>
                     <p>Whensoever I intend to take some Hony from the Bees, I provide linnen rags, wherewith I make a smoak, and let it into the Hive, by pulling away the door D, from whence the Bees are driven by the smoak toward their small entrance C, so that I may safely take away as many prolongers as I think good, and put a fresh one in the place, shutting it up with the door D.</p>

I suppose many know better than I can Inform them, who for the most part are supplied with Dutch or French Brandy, those Nations eating, as it were, the Bread out of our mouths, by which meanes the wages of the painful Fisherman is, for the most part, at the winding up pocketted by Strangers, whereas if we were able to furnish the same Commodity at like or lower price, it would be to us no small annual profit, since, in such like Trade, the Fisherman consumes, for the most part, one half of his year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly earnings.</p>

                     <p>But while I thus swerve from my professed theme, which is to give you (according to that Observation that I have taken) an account of Bees; give me leave to hint one thing, which (in my opinion) is the Master-piece of whatsoever you have waded in. I cannot say that you are the Author of it, since I have read many Overtures made of and concerning that Subject, by others, yet I know that your self are none of the least drivers on of that design, namely, the Advancing of Credit, so as to make Bills Currant in payment, to the wonderful encrease of Trading, to which I may also adde your Office of Publique Addresse, both which Enterprizes (if not unseasonable mercies at present) I hope the Lord will give this Nation to enjoy,</p>
                     <p>But as concerning our present matter, which at this time I chiefly intend, namely, concerning Bees, I understand from you, that your chief desire to be informed concerning them, is first, How they may be engendred? Secondly, How encreased? and thirdly, How inriched with Wax and Honey?</p>
                     <p>For the first, The truth is, I have read in some Authors of their engendering out of dead Kine, fermented with the falling dew. Some think, that out of any kind of beast Bees may be produced, and doe conclude, that the Bees which bestowed their Honey on
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:118800:14"/>
the carcasse of the Lion, slain by <hi>Samson,</hi> were of this nature, and bred out of that savage Creature; yet must I confesse, that I never yet saw the Experiment of Bees engendred in or from any dead Carcasse, though I have known several sorts of dead Creatures both open, and covered with leaves, lightly exposed to the continual dewes, yet never could I take notice of any such procreation. And that out of Kine, either strangled, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise dying, and so lying abroad, exposed to the influence of the Heavens, Bees naturally will not spring, I am induced: For that in the Summer Islands, where I was born, I never yet saw one Bee, except those of a kind called Humble Bees, where notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, to my knowledge, divers Cattle both younger and older, have (perishing by mischance, as it oft falls out there, that the very heat of the noon. Sun in Summer kills Cattle if not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved into the shade) lyen in the open fields till they have rotted, and have not a night scarce wanted the dew, in which Maggots and Wormes have bred, but no Bees, which if they were so to be bred, I suppose would in lesse than fourty yeares have been seen in those Islands, in which I never saw any, though I was naturally a great Observer of Insects there, where I noted Waspes, but no Honey making Bees. Nor is it to be thought, that the Climate is averse to the Generation of Insects, which it there produceth of other kinds as plentifully, if not more than many other places, in which Bees are,</p>
                     <p>Also my ingendred Curiosity was so great, that I took the pain to observe and collect the Generation of several Insects, with their various mutations from kind to kind, sparing no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent travel that might benefit me herein. For so soon as I began to read a little in Philosophy, I took great content in these Contemplations, which after in New <hi>England</hi> I as carefully no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. In the Summer Islands I found, that in Rain-water kept in wooden Troughs (especially where the Sun at some time of the day shineth on it) there would in time gather a sedimen of muddy matter to the bottome, black and slimy, out of which would breed at the bottom, crawling long ill-favoured Wormes, with many feet: these Wormes growing bigger and bigger would swim and play together, and engender sexually, till at last growing more slow, they would at length lose almost all

motion, at last coming to the top of the water, would by the legs hang neer the superficies, where in few dayes, opening the back, out of them proceeds a Fly, which crawling out of the water, is for a day or two tender, after able to fly, which Fly, after a time casting its skin, becomes another creeping Insect, with out wings, and of it proceeds another Fly, farre different from the former. So in the ground, I have often under stones or tufts of grasse found tender Wormes, which are naturally in time of their own accord incrusted, and so lying a space, at length break, out of which comes a great Butter-fly, which layeth her Eggs on the Orange tender leaves, where the dew hatcheth them into Wormes, which live on the leaves, and if touched send forth long red hornes; these at length, hanging to the n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

I might speak largely, were it not besides my proposed intent and scope at present.</p>
                     <p>A third very anomalous Generation, which I have noted, is of a sort of stinging Flies out of rotten Trees: these, in the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Islands, I have observed out of the rotting Palmeto, and in New <hi>England</hi> I have seen the same in rotten Poplar and Birch: In which a man may at one time see some, like to a tender Sper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical milk, enclosed in a most tender skin, others like to a white Maggot, with a little motion, others now almost shaped like a Fly, others full formed, and able to crawle, others ready to come forth, and in a short time after to fly.</p>

I think then, that our sloth is very great, in that we neglect the inquiry into this particular. I shall a little touch, and perhaps not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinently here. In the Summer Islands there is a sort of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that is very large, and of admirable gay colours, yellowish, blackish, greenish, and reddish, so intermixed, that it makes the Creature very delectable to look on; these in great multitudes are there, who live abroad in the open fields, spinning their webbs from tree to tree of a vast bignesse, to catch Flies in, on the which they prey: their webbs are yellow, and most pure Silk, of which one Maid for tryall knit a pair of Gloves, which prove

Now if these Spiders were so kept, as an ingenions man might easily invent, <hi>they by feeding kept in good plight,</hi> might be made to spin quantity enough, for as much as in few houres they will spin a large web, if their old one be taken away, else they mind one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their prey.

                     <p>Now as to Medicinal Virtues of Insects I might be very large, but I shall willingly passe them over; onely this I shall say, being desirous to try what might be done upon this account, I took Blood, and pouring the Water from the Clodds of them, by putrefaction I had great Maggots, with moisture, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming the moisture grew in quantity, and were in a manner dry, these I washed clean, killed them, and bruised them, and of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:118800:17"/>
them had in a second putrefaction other lesse Maggots, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what differing from the other, and with a tolerable smell to the other; these being grown to their greatest, I washed again, kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and so putrified them, and this a third and a fourth time I repeated, then I took them, and having first washed them, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested them (being bruised) for six weeks, and distilling them, had a Water and a yellow coloured Oyle, of the most exquisite penetrating resolving vertue that ever I knew, which I yet call <hi>Oleum Lumbricorum Verum,</hi> Attempting the same with livers of Beasts it succeeded in like manner.</p>
                     <p>But now to return to the History of Bees, to wit, their propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation; It is known, that if they have good Hives, with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient shelter, and sufficient store of meat, they will encrease sufficiently. So then the main matter is to know how Bees may best be stored with Honey.</p>
                     <p>First of all, if your Design of planting of Fruit trees take ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, that alone would mightily encrease Bees, it is not to be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited what one Orchard will afford to that purpose. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the time of the blossoming of Fruit trees lasts not long, there would be found out some fit meanes for to nourish them in the later moneths of the year; it being a Proverb, that <hi>a Swarm of Bees in</hi> May <hi>is worth a Cow and a Bottle o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> Hay,</hi> whereas <hi>a Swarm in</hi> July <hi>is not worth a Fly.</hi> For it is evident, that the dew which falls on the floures is that which Bees suck; though <hi>Iuly, August, September,</hi> and part of <hi>October,</hi> are for the heat of weather, as seasonable for Bees to work in as <hi>May,</hi> yet in them they enrich themselves but little, because of the scarcity of Flours, Blossomes, Honeysuckles, and the like, which at that season of the year are rare.</p>
                     <p>Your Letter to me (in which is the transcript of part of an Epistle) to this end, commending the planting of Anise, doth seem very rational; first in that Anise yeilds an innumerable company of small floures (as also sweet Fennel) which if gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a morning, the dew on the flowers is very pleasant. The like also is on Parsly, Carroots, in their flouring, but not so pleasant or grateful to the Bees as Anise or Fennel, in regard of the sweet scent which they carry, which alone is very alluring to them. For in dew it self is a sweet Sacharine salt, which yet Bees

Yea, Experience it self shewes, that by the <hi>ferment</hi> of these the dew is transmuted, and obtaines a sweetnesse many degrees passing bare dew, yea, and a Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence also, as appeares in Manna, The reniabin, and the like, the falling of which I have oft and diligently noted, and find it to be materially nothing but dew, which falling on some things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes inspissated: Yet cannot I but respect the making of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, as a thing peculiar to Bees, and although according to the Proverb (<hi>&amp; mel sibi parant vespae</hi>) yet in my opinion there is worthily a great difference to be acknowledged between Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney and other inspissated sweetnesses, so that neither Manna, nor any such falling congealed sweetnesse, hath the like nature as Honey, which in its Analysis more easily is apparent. I oft have with a clean linnen gathered the sweetnesse of the tops of Fennel, and wringing it out of the linnen, have tryed if or no it had the parts of Honey, but found in them a great difference, by which I learned, that Bees out of the falling dew, by a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar fermenting virtue, doe really transmute what they suck into Honey.

The Molossoes was not that which the Sugar-refiners leave, for I know not what an enemy the lime <hi>Alcali</hi> that is in it may be to Bees, but the first Molossoes. Now I should for my part rather rake the refuse Honey which is got by squeezing the Combes, and also the Combes washings, which I would sprinkle with a little meal and Anise seeds small beaten, the one to keep them from drowning in it, the other for scent, and this, I am assured, will feed Bees excellently, and for one pound they will return four: <hi>This I know</hi>; The water best for this purpose is that of Rain, which hath in it a sweet Salt. And that no man may wonder at this, consider how that Honey originally is but dew, which is but little different from Rain: For as a milch Cow drinking soundly of water, doth actually give the more Milk, which Milk is farre different from water, yet multiplied by it even to sense, so naturally doth the Bee transmute what it sucks into Honey, insom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:118800:21"/>
those accidental trials, proves the nearest way home.</p>
                     <p>But if this were to be further proved upon the account of profit, another course must be taken, of doing in greater quantity, and the easiest and shortest Method is desired. Therefore I, like a Traveller, did intend onely a relation of things fecible, which I have my self again proved, and on my reputation affirm, both possibly and easie in nature; and this I did to shew the Good which might accrew to the Publique by the prosecution of your Design, both in storing the Land with Corn, Fruits and Honey. I added the Meanes or Key, both for the one and other, namely, by reiterated fermentation, and so writing, I wrote to such, who in some measure understood Phylosophy, who weighing the effect with its causes, might not streight condemn my Candour, in case he for once or twice should prove unsuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessful, whereas a Receipt is every mans meat, and to such who lesse understand Nature, what Receipt can be full enough. For he who writes, measures other mens understanding partly by his own, and what he understands fully and scientifically, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supposeth another will understand sufficiently, and therefore leaves out many Circumstances which are not so necessary, or may be otherwise, or such which he presupposes (<hi>praecognita</hi>) or what a small insight into practique Phylosophy may dictate. My meaning is, that in as much as those Experiments were not so reiterated, as a Tanners making his liquor, I could not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly throw the Receipts into the mouth of every one that could but gape. For what I try in a gallon, if I should prescribe in that quantity, my Receipt would be contemptible, if I should analogize by proportion, my Doctrine might be uncertain, in the particular which is most certain in the general. My Work is to hint to the Ingenuous what may be done, and let it be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient that (<hi>fide bona</hi>) I deliver what is really true in Nature, and adde the onely Meanes, which is by reiterate fermentation. But yet to adde what light I can to him, who would attempt this, I shall, so farre as in me is, discover things more punctually</p>
                     <p>First as to <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> let Pease be taken and steeped in as much water as will cover them, till they swell and Corn, and be so ordered as Barley is for the Malting, onely with this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, that for this work if they sprout twice as much as Barley
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:118800:21"/>
doth in making Malt it is the better: these Pease thus sprouted if beaten small, which is easily done they being so tender, put into a vessel, and stopt with a Bung and a R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>g as usually, these will ferment, and after two, or three, or four moneths, if distilled, will really perform what I promised.</p>
                     <p>The Water that soaked them, it is good to save, either for the soaking of fresh, or for putting on them, being beaten, which else require some quantity of water to be added to them, but not much, and the like may be done in all other Grain, which the addition of refuse Honey will advance (as to quantity of Spirit) exceedingly. Thus may a Spirit of <hi>Aqua vitae</hi> be made out of any green growing thing, of which the leaves being fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, will yeild a small quantity of such a Spirit. So Roots, Berries and Seeds, which are not oyly, yea and those which are oyly, whose fatnesse is essential, that is, which may be distilled over in an Alembick with water, will afford some more, some lesse of <hi>Aqua vitae.</hi> Let me adde, that the Spirit which is made out of Grain not dryed into Malt, is more pleasant than the other.</p>
                     <p>Now give me leave to adde my opinion, and what I would try further in this case. I would often stir the matter in fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, that is, once a day, during the first twenty dayes, and for the first week, when it begins to work, give it a small vent, which to me seemes a wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> of bettering the fermentation, and by consequent of augmenting and meliorating the Spirit. But in this I leave every man to his own <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ngeny, and should be glad to have these my Experiments ripened for the good of many.</p>
                     <p>Now as to Vinification, let me for a ground lay this down for a Position, that the vegetable Spirit in all Hearbs, Trees, Plants, and Fruits, Berries, and also Seeds, (not of a grosse oyly nature) is vinous, but in Grain and fruit more especially of the later, of which the Grape is but one Species. Now in both, the Rule to distinguish the copiousnesse of this vertue is the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; for by how much the more of that, by so much the more of the Vinous Spirit.</p>
                     <p>Now Honey is a Vegetable Magistery, in part perfected by the Specifick virtue of the flour, &amp;c. on which the dew falling, is made sweeter than of it self it was, (yet formally distinguished
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:118800:22"/>
from Honey, which I have oft proved by disti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>tion) but is compleated by the peerlesse virtue of the Bee, which doth trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mute that sweetnesse into a new Creature, which is Honey. This therefore, by reason of its eminent sweetnesse, is rich of that vinous Spirit fore-mentioned, and may therefore be preferred to either Grain or Fruit; for example; Let the tryall be made with about a gallon of Honey, despume it, and adde to it about an equall part of Water, or three parts of Water to two of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> ferment it with a treble fermentation; and after six moneths this will be farre richer, both in tast and smell, than any Wine that comes from any of the Spanish Territories, and that by farre. But as the price of good Honey goes now, to have a quart of Wine in its materials to cost a shilling or sixteen pence, which is the price of good Honey, would be a dear rate; by which it may appear, what the benefit of your present Design of inriching us with store of Honey may be; for I say, what I have tried, that Wine made of Honey alone without any other thing, thrice fermented as it ought to be, gives a drink more like a celestial Nectar then a Terrestrial Wine, both for Taste and Odour.</p>
                     <p>But Graines gives a more Austere Wine, and alone much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled a fyall Wine, which is done thus. Take as much Malt as a Cask will hold fill it with scalding hot water, that the water be no more than the Cask will hold after it is full of Malt; let it soak so for a day and night, then presse it out exquisitely, as Wines are pressed, then put it into a vessel, and with Yest bring it to work, which by every day moving with a rod, and covering it with cloths, and not giving it much vent, will be continued at least six or seven dayes, so much the better if the vessel be so big beyond what it containes, as that it work not over, and the vent that is left be small<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> but the bung so closed, as that it may be opened and shut daily for to stir the matter soundly, and when the ferment is ceased, with new Yest bring it to a second, and so to a third fermentation, observing the same method as in the first, then close it well, and set it in a cool Cellar for about four moneths, in which time it acquires the natural properties of Wine, and may be accordingly handled.</p>
                     <p>Now by this that hath so plainly been set down, any ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:118800:22"/>

Fourthly, they will feed on Flies, or any blood of beast cloddered exceedingly, and all their nourishment may be forced out in Silk, which they as naturally make in their tail (which is a great bag, like a Pigeons Egge in bignesse) as Bees doe Honey.</p>
                     <p>Now if the Silk-worm that is so tender, may be so improved, being so hard to feed, and must be kept in houses, much more these Spiders, which are so hardy; and will feed on any trumpery (and who knowes what they may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I perswade my self, that one large Spider of this sort, would yeild more Silk in a Summer than six Silk-wormes, and that may ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them worth the keeping, their Silk being full as good as any. Yet they may doe as well here as the Silk-worm, for ought I
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:118800:23"/>
know, being by ten fold more hardy than any Silk-worm, and Flies are a sufficient food for them, which how easily taken I need not mention.</p>
                     <p>As to the India Fig, the usuall name of it is the Prickled Pear, so known in that place, and as to the transportation of it hither, here to grow, it is enough it growes there, being an Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Plantation, or the fruit it self may, without the tree, be year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brought over at rates reasonable enough, if first any ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man (whom it may concern) should, for trial sake, send for a small parcel, and upon tryal find it advantageous. I for my part procured of the fruit for my Experiment, and found the generation of that Infect out of it, which way I recommend to any that desires further resolution in that Point.</p>
                     <p>Now as to the Generation of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>nsects, <hi>I</hi> shall give my usuall Encheiria, though I need not, having particularly set down the same work, how it is performed out of the blood and livers of beasts, which were enough to any, who by the length of <hi>Hercules</hi> foot, could calculate the proportion of his whole body.</p>
                     <p>Vegetables of tincture are either Hearbs, Woods, or Fruits, as Berries, &amp;c. as for Hearbs, I dry them (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>Berries I stamp and boyle them, or evaporate them to the consistence of a Rob: and then use them as the other.</p>
                     <p>Woods I infuse in water, being pulverised, and boyle out their
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:118800:23"/>
tincture, and then evaporate the water to such a consistence as the other, and use them in the like way. The Flies will play about the sides of the vessel and surface of the matter, which taken, are killed in a warm pan or stove, and dryed, and so kept.</p>
                     <p>Thus out of a red Berry, of which I spake in my former Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I made an Insect no whit inferiour to the best Cochmeel, and I suppose I have added sufficient to the Information of the weakest capacity.</p>
                     <p>As for my History of one who did so feed Bees, as I spake of in my first Letter, the Gentleman is at present both out of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, England,</hi> and this Life, being lately dead.</p>
                     <p>Now what concernes the Doctrine of Fermentations, on which depends the unfolding of the Mystery of Mellification, and making Wax, I have reserved that for another place and time, since being prolixe and Phylosophical, it doth require a peculiar Treatise, and I falling on it here, found it too abstruse to be briefly handled, lest brief Instances, which I should be forced to bring, should beget a thousand scruples and new que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions. As for the practique of it, this dilemma answers all: Either it will, or it will not; if it will, then farre more Bees may be kept, if out of (Not Honey) they make Honey, and out of (Not Wax) they make Wax, by an actual transmutation, which I experimentally affirm: if not, then fewer can be kept, if they must seek their Wax out of the Gummosity of some floures, as some fondly imagine, since Wax formally differs from any fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness under Heaven. One half houres attendance in a day on a late Swarm of Bees in <hi>Iuly</hi> or <hi>August,</hi> will put all out of questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to any other that shall try it, as it hath been experimentally put out of controversie to me. But to lay down the Phyloso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy of the thing will maime a large Treatise, which I have in Latine composed (<hi>de fermentis</hi>) which I shall be unwilling to dismember, and send part of it out lamely in an English dresse.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, as to the meeting of Wines, it is done the same way as new are made. <hi>viz</hi> by dissolving Honey in some quantity of it self, and warming it so as it lose not the Spirit (which is to be therefore done in a close Vessel) then put to the Vessel of Wine, and by Yest (or otherwise) let it be brought to a thorough

                     <opener>SIR,</opener>
                     <p>BEing made known to you, I could wish it had been by a better Character than a Bee-Master. Tis true, since I left the hot service of the City, I have an Apiary in the Country, wherein I found profit enough: But I considered, that Wax and Honey was not all the benefit which God afforded from that Creature; he that sends us to the Ant, gives us leave to observe the same and better qualities in the Bee; I observed many rarities in their work and government, by mine own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience upon <hi>Buttlers</hi> Observations: But when he told me of a Gentleman, in <hi>Plinies</hi> time, that endeavoured to make their works transparent (but, as he thought, improbable) I tryed, and finished that Essay, to the satisfaction of my self and others.</p>
                     <p>The Invention is a fancie that suits with the nature of that Creature, they are much taken with their Grandeiur, and double their tasks with delight; I took fourteen quarts out of one of the transparent Hives, double their quantity of others, they quickly paid me the charges, with their profit, and doubled it with pleasure; I can take a strict account of their work, and thereby guesse how the rest prosper. Every time I view them (whilst their work lasts) I have <hi>aliquid novi</hi> (something new)
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:118800:25"/>
which must needs be more pleasing than the sight of a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, which affords but water, running in the same manner. This Honey diversly placed with diversity of Combs, whereof I have observed six fill'd in six dayes, of so many quarts, but it was in the time of a Mill-dew.</p>
                     <p>If you desire the Model or Description, I shall give the same to you that I did to Dr. <hi>Wilkins,</hi> Warden of <hi>Waddham,</hi> who hath, with great curiosity, set up one in his Garden, and, as I hear, is setting up another with augmentations: I intended it at first for an Hyerogliphick of labour, upon which a Gentleman be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed a Statue of that form to crown it, which in three yeares standing yeilded to the injuries of the Wind, Weather and Sun, which being repaird now leaves at the bottom of the Pedestal, with this Inscription, <hi>Non amissus sed submissus</hi> (the Emblem of our Calling) instead thereof are erected at the top three Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonal Dyals, over them three Weather-Glasses, with a Clepsy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dra to shew the hour when the Sun shines not, over that a Cock, that will speak the Winds seat at Mid-night, upon which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed a Saphigue to satisfie the Latine or English Reader, thus;

                     <opener>SIR,</opener>
                     <p>I Am willing to confesse my fault (if it be a fault) that my worthy Friend Mr. <hi>Angelo</hi> took notice of you, as an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Bee-Master: for knowing you by your other better Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, which are so publique, that none can be ignorant there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, who hath heard of your name, I gave him notice of your rare industry (a thing not so publiquely known as it deserves) in discovering the industriousnesse of that pretty Creature, and my design was to get him to write to you, so as to make some overture for me, to use freedome afterwards with you about that Subject, which he having done, and you having entertained with so much alacrity, and hearty expressions, I am bound to thank you for it, and desirous to expresse my thankfulnesse with such Communications, as are within the sphere of my activity of this kind, or of any other better matters of a publique nature;
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:118800:26"/>
and in testimony hereof, be pleased to accept of the adjoyned Packet with several Treatises and Books, wherein also you will happily find something, which may give occasion to your inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious spirit, to try some other Conclusions of Husbandry with delight and profit: For God's Way's to such as find them out are full of both; and I am apt to believe, that when God set <hi>Adam</hi> in the Garden <hi>Eden</hi> to keep it and dresse it, He meant to exercise his Industry, as well about the discovery of the fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of perfect nature, which could not be without much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to his understanding, as about the pleasantnesse of the place, which he could have by dressing increased, and made com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly answerable to the perfection of his own imagination. For although there was nothing imperfect in Nature before the Curse, yet all the imaginable perfections, which the seminal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of the Earth contained, were not actually existent at the first instant; the kinds were each distinct by themselves, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any defect, but what Marriages and Combinations there might be made between them, and what the effects thereof would be, when the proper Agents and Patients should meet, I suppose was left to his industry to try: and although we now come farre short of that knowledge, which he had in Nature, and the Womb, thereof, by reason of that Curse is shut up unto us: Yet we find by Experience, that to such as are her faithful and laborious Servants, and find out the Seat of Gods Vertue in her, to trace the Way of his Operation, She rewards alwayes their paines both with profit and pleasure, which in your Answer to my fore-named worthy Friend you bear witnesse unto, when you tell him, that in your Apiary in the Country, you not onely found profit enough (and what you mean by enough is left to our conjecture) but that besides the benefit of Wax and Honey, you gained more delightful Observations of their Working, and Government, then happily the Ant can afford us; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I doe very fully believe, therefore I am an humble Sutor unto you, that at some spare time you would renew to your own memory your delightful contemplation of the rare qualities of that Creature, and putting them to paper, shew forth the Wisdome of the Creator therein, for such things should not be concealed, because they are reall Demonstrations of his Power,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:118800:26"/>
and I am perswaded, you will take it in good part, that such as love Him for Himself are curious to know the Workmanship o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> his hands, and the Wayes by which the best discovery thereof is made.</p>
                     <p>If then upon this account you would let some of your sparkes flie abroad amongst us, you may perhaps kindle some light more than we have, which in due time may reflect with some heat upon your self back again. For you tell us, that Dr. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins,</hi> Warden of <hi>Wadham,</hi> is setting up a Glasse-Hive in his Garden, with augmentations to that Model which he received from you, which no doubt he is obliged to impart unto you, as to the Father of the Invention; and if I may be so happy, as to be your Schollar, both in that which is your own, and what is super-added by him, perhaps my Friends and I will not be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unfruitful, at least we shall not be unmindful of you, but give some return of what our Experiments may produce. But to doe this we must be set in the way by you; therefore give me leave to beg a full Description of your transparent Hive, in the Parts and Dimensions thereof, and if you have any to spare (now the season is past) and would send one up by the Carrier which comes from your parts, I shall undertake to see it sent back again unto you without your cost. If you have many Glasse-Hives, you will be the better able to gratifie me herein, but if you have none to spare, I shall rest satisfied with that, which you shall be pleased to afford me with your convenience.</p>
                     <p>The Reason wherefore in the Glasse-Hives the Bees should double their Work, and delight in their Grandeiur, I conceive, by what you write, is discernable, but as yet I cannot reach it, till by your Experience and Sagacity the hint be given me, that I may in due time by my self, or some Friends, make also a tryall thereof.</p>
                     <p>But have you yet been able to make any estimate of the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Wax and Honey, which they are able to give one year with another, seeing you speak a very big word of 300000 <hi>lt.</hi> a year, which might accrew to the Nation from this little Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? I make no doubt, but you are able to make thi, out, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it doth, I confesse, goe beyond my reach, and to raise the Industrie which may be used towards the Common-wealth
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:118800:27"/>
of Bees in this Nation, it would be a thing worth your publique disposition to give a Demonstration thereof; for I suppose it will be grounded more upon the plenty, which your new Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth yeild, then upon the ordinary way.</p>
                     <p>But happily your Experience to something also extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary concerning the feeding as well as the Hiving of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious Creature, will give some further addition. For no doubt there are certain Hearbs which make them thrive better than others, of all which, if at your convenient time you will be as good as you<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>THe knocks and calls of two such unknown Friends, as your self and Mr. <hi>Angelo,</hi> coming with such choyce Books, and so much candor, <hi>exprest in too many, and two friendly Letters,</hi> were enough to make the sourest Hermite look out of his Cell, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if he spies the coasts clear without Swords and Pistols. The truth is, I am but one of many my fellow Shepherds, that have taken Sanctuary in our Cotts, ever since the Alarme was
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:118800:27"/>
given us by the Anti-Pastoral Party, and being likely to be stript to the Bag and Bottle, you cannot blame us, if we whistle away some of our sad and spare houres (whilst Shepherds are smitten, and Sheep scatter'd) to observe <hi>Magnalia Dei in Minimis.</hi> Melancholy loosers will rather play at small games than give over.</p>
                     <p>When I saw God make good his Threat (<hi>Solvam Cingulae Regum</hi>) and break the Reines of Government, I observed, that this pretty Bird (whereof you write) was true to that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wherein God and Nature had set it to serve. Hereupon my pleasure began to vie with my profit, and I was willing, for once, to yeild the stakes to my pleasure.</p>
                     <p>Briefly Sir, being sent for up amongst others of my Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to serve the State, I left a Model of this innocent Phancie in past-board, which at my return (by the care of my vertuous Wife, now with God) I found set up in the midst of my Garden in plain Free-stone; In this I placed an upper and lower Hive, over them a Trygonal Dial, over that three Weather Glasses, over that a Water-watch topt with a Weather-cock: This pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the stead of the Statue of labour, which the Wind and Weather had brought from top to bottom, so that it was obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to my Phantasie, to conceit this to be the Hyerogliphick of their Hyerarchy, whose labour was lost in their Grandeiur, and brought to that low price, that any of their meanest quality might come up to it, and be taken at his word, though he bid never so meanly.</p>
                     <p>I considered, that God gives us leave to make the most and best we can of those Relicks of his goodness, whereof we have baffled away the better part; as those Travellers, that have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nighted themselves by their frolick baitings, make much of their diversified reflections of the Sun set in the Clouds, and when they have almost lost his light, make pass-time with his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours.</p>
                     <p>This will excuse me (in case I fall short of that profit which you suspect I make) that I begin and stand so long upon the pleasure, and shall now take leave to surfet you with my Honey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sops, before <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <pb n="48" facs="tcp:118800:28"/>Now what concernes the profit, you tell me of a big word I should let fall, of 300000 <hi>lib. per annum,</hi> which our Nation might make of them, if all of my ability would undertake to keep as many as my self; one cipher mistaken may much alter the sum; but grant it so as you have set it, cast it thus, I never kept twenty Stalls, and usually take but half, yet doe I value my Wax and Honey worth twenty Nobles at the least; Now if he that is valued but as the tenth part of a Parish, at most, can make so much, what may the rest? what may the County? what the Nation?</p>
                     <p>Whereas you say, a place may be over stockt (granting Mill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dewes) I deny it. Had we an hundred Hives for one, where there are store of Oakes and Maples, the place cannot be over stor'd with Bees. So that if there were a Statute for Parish Bees, as well as Parish Butts, and Parochial Appiaries design'd for those places, where observed best to thrive, I know not why a Parish may not make as much Honey (as one Gentleman of <hi>Norfolk</hi>) <hi>viz.</hi> 300 <hi>li. de claro,</hi> as I heard <hi>per annum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As for your design of feeding them (as that Gentleman in <hi>Italy</hi>) I conceive it here unfeaseable, or if it were it would not quit cost; I care not to feed them, except to save them in spring time, and strengthen them for work: Hearbs and Floures are but from hand to mouth, serve for Bee-bread: If Mill-dewes fall not, Bees thrive not, for they are, with Gods blessing, the Antidote to that Curse: As for your honest pity to that poor Creature (I shall try a Conclusion this Summer which may save some few Stalls, but in saving (poor Stalls) we dammage them, and (in saving the rich) our selves; the middle sort are best for store, and enough for those that are not covetous, with whom they seldom thrive, because they over act their part in sparing, as carelesse persons in their neglect of keeping them. I can and shall afford you what satisfaction you please, in any useful questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that concernes the welfare of their Common-wealth.</p>
                     <p>As for my transparent Hives, I have but two, which are not moveable, else you should willingly have them, whither you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd them or not; they serve onely to give me an account of the daily income, and a diary of their Negotiations, whereby if I spend half an hour after dinner or supper, I know what hath

                     <head>A Letter, concerning that pleasant and profitable Invention of a Transparent Bee-hive, written by that much accomplish'd, and very ingenious Gentleman, Fellow of <hi>All-Soules</hi> Colledge in <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> Mr. <hi>Christ. Wren,</hi> with the Figure and Description of the said Transparent Bee-hive.</head>
                     <opener>HONOURED SIR,</opener>
                     <p>YOu have by several hands intimated your Desires to me, of having a particular Description of our three-storied-Bee-hive. I confesse I was not over forward to execute this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of yours; and my reason was, because the Devise not fully answering our own expectation, I thought it would be much more unsatisfactory to you: but since you please to persist in your desires, (as Mr. <hi>Rawlinson</hi> told me the other day) I can be no longer shameless to persist in my incivility, especially prompted by mine own Ambition, to find any way to shew my self a Servant to a Person so eminent amongst the <hi>Ingeniosi</hi> as your self.</p>
                     <p>The Description, I think, is evident enough in the Paper; I shall onely tell you what effects we find. Last <hi>May</hi> (as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member) we put in two Swarmes together, leaving the places to goe in, open onely in the lowermost, but all the passage holes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen from Box to Box: in the middlemost they first began their Combes, then in the lowermost, before they had filled the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlemost, and so continued till they had filled both, which before they had quite finished, they began to make two little Combes in the upper Box, (all this while deserted) and continued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, a part of a Comb of the middle story an inch or two up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the upper box, filling almost the passage hole quite up, leaving themselves onely a little hole, as big as two fingers might go in, for their passage up and down: I am not very certain, whether this was not done at first when they wrought in the middle Box, and whether this was not the reason, why they wrought so little in the upper Box, because they stopped themselves up from an easie passage to it. The Combes in the lower stories were well replenished with Honey, and suddainly, but these little Combes
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:118800:29"/>
in the upper they quite defert, contrary to our expectation, which was, that they would have wrought most in the upper story, and the middlemost, in which, when they had wrought enough for their own spending, that then we might take away the uppermost from them, and so have continued still: but if we find another year, that they fill not again the uppermost, it will be all one still to take away the lowermost from them, but if that be so, then two Hives will be sufficient. We must rather desire of you farther light in this business, which I presume you can afford us, from other mens Observations, that have tried the like Experiment, for as yet you see ours is imperfect, and we know not what to make of it.</p>

                     <head>Considerations upon the Letter from <hi>Oxford.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>SIR,</p>
                     <p>Upon speech with Mr. <hi>Greatrix</hi> (according to your desires) I find, that the substance of what he intimated to you the other day, upon the sight of your Letter from <hi>Oxford,</hi> was no other than what truly my thoughts from my own reason, and the sight of Dr. <hi>Brown's</hi> Essay upon the same subject, confirmed me in: <hi>viz.</hi> that Bees, as they do naturally begin in the top of the Hive and work downwards, so do they not like that that top should be more than one, or at most two stories high. For as by the judgements of all that write of Bees, a valley is counted the best kind of seat for them, to the intent, that when they come heavy loaden home (as they do often in a day) their journey may be a descent, and consequently easie, so from the same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son ought the work within the Hive to be so ordered, as to be upon as little ascent as may be, or rather upon a descent. I mean, that it be so ordered, as that the Bees may go rather down than upwards within their Hive. Upon this ground my opinion is, that one Box is (at the beginning) sufficient, or but two at the most. When this one (if but one be used at first) shall be filled, it would (the entrance into it being first stopped, and the lower middle hole of it be left open) be set upon another lower Box, and when this second Box shall be also filled, a third would be set under the two first, and when the whole Body of the Bees is fully gone down into the third or lowest Box, then (and not before) may the first or upper Box be taken away; and after this manner may the upper Box still be taken away from time to time, as often as the lower shall be filled, and a new empty one put under. This I have gathered from such Books as I have met with, but that which from my own private judgement I offer as a futher Addition is, that I could wish that the lowest Box should be still so placed, as to hang down through and below the planke or seat upon which Hives are ordinarily placed, so as that the Bees, when they come heavy loaden home, may go down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards into it. When this lowest Hive is almost full (which might be discovered through windows left for that purpose)
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:118800:31"/>
than would another empty one be put into its place, and the Box that is almost full so to be placed upon the empty one, as that the Bees may enter by a hole in the lower part of it, and (when it is absolutely full) go down into the lowest Box. And by this meanes the heavy loaden Bees (instead of carrying their loads three stories high, according to the <hi>Oxford</hi> practise) do still work either downwards, or very little upwards. I will conclude this Subject with an Observation concerning these little Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>viz.</hi> that their King weares no sword, I mean, hath no sting of their own, nor any <hi>Ianizaries,</hi> nor other meanes of safety to themselves, than the loyalty of their Subjects.</p>

                  <div type="item">
                     <head>Some remarkable Observations, concerning the swarming of Bees; together with a short Description of a Bee-hive made of Glasse.</head>
                     <p>ALthough Experience tells us, that Bees do naturally love to hive in woods and other places out of mens sight, and that chiefly at the time, when they send forth their numerous Swarms like so many new Colonies; yet notwithstanding, they may be brought so to part with that kind of wildness, as to give men leave to observe them, and to admire Nature, whose pleasure it is, in this contemptible sort of Insects, to make shew of the great riches of her Treasury. This is not hard to prove.</p>
                     <p>For it is known, that Bees, when they begin to swarm, and that the heat of the Sun hath drawn them out of their Hive, do fly about till their King (whom Nature hath wisely unarmed) doth by his sitting down determine the place of their Rendezvous, which they immediately take notice of, and all those huge num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of them (being from that time forwards to make their own fortunes, and to be their own Purveyors) do pitch their Camp round about their King. Presently after which, a certain kind of Bees, which are commonly called Scouts, are sent out to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover places for them to hive; and till these Scouts return, the whole Swarm sits still to refresh themselves, being weary with flying at their first swarming. These Scouts at their return rush violently in upon the Swarm, and carry away to the place which they have found, some part of the Swarm, together with the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:118800:31"/>
King, on whom depends the unity, good fortune and safety of them all.</p>
                     <p>In the Northern Countries, as <hi>Poland, Lithvania</hi> and <hi>Musco<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vie,</hi> men use to make Hives for them on purpose in the Woods and where such are the Bees chuse them, but if they can find none such, then they hive in old, hollow and rotten trees, and that for many yeares together, till the hollow place being filled with that excellent liquor of Honey, they are forced to go to some other place. So that many times those that fell wood do, when they little think of it, find in hollow trees great store of Honey.</p>
                     <p>It is remarkable, that most Swarms, as soon as they come out, do rest themselves in some place near to their old Hives, for two or three houres together, in which time, unless they have Hives provided them, they forsake their former Master, and betake themselves to the Woods and solitary places. But if they have Hives provided for them, they submit themselves to the Owners of those Hives, especially if their King (which is observeable) be shut into a little den made on purpose, and be kept there for three or four dayes together. In which time chiefly you may perceive a wonderful diligence in the Bees, and that it may be the better seen by such as are curious, and admirers of Nature, Industry hath shewed how to make Hives of Glass, which may be placed in Gardens, and other convenient places, and even in Windowes.</p>
                     <div type="procedure">
                        <head>The manner whereof is this following.</head>
                        <p>Let great care be taken in the choice of the place; for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience will shew, there lies much in that. It will be best for this purpose to chuse a window towards the Sun-rising, for by this means, the Bees will have their industry quickened, which from the very Sun-rising will set them to work, they being Creatures so intent upon their business: and besides, it will free the poor weak things from many inconveniencies. It will be otherwise, if you chuse for this purpose a place towards the West or North, for the light of the rising-Sun, coming but late upon a place that is towards the West, will make the Bees go late to worke, and the North with its natural sharpness will weaken and shrink up the tender bodies of those little Creatures,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:118800:32"/>
they delighting in heat: so that the East and the South are for this purpose farre better than the other two quarters of the world.</p>
                        <p>Having so chosen the place, let there be made an Hive of about a yard high or a little more, after this fashion. Fasten four little pillars of wood in two boards, one on the top and the other at the bottom, and let the pillars be answerable to the height of your window, and let that side of the Hive, which is to be towards the air, be half a yard broad, and the other side, which is to be towards your chamber, a quarter of a yard broad. In that side which is towards the air, you are to leave a slit of about two fingers breadth, for the Bees to fly in and out at, and in the middle of that slit you must put a cross peice of wood, which must be very well fastened, that it slip not up and down, and so crush the Honey-combes, but that it may the better bear the weight of them. In the inner side of the Hive, you are to make doors about a quarter of a yard broad, and well and strongly bolted, that the Bees may be kept from flying into your chamber. Through these doors you are to put in your Swarm, and take out your Honey. And for the space between the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said pillars, you may have it closed either with whole glass, or with smaller peices leaded; or if you will have the whole Hive of glasse, the Glass-makers can make it for you, but you must ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the Conditions before expressed.</p>
                        <p>Having thus prepared all things, you may place the Swarms where you intend to have them in the Hive, and with delight behold their work, and in a kind of rapture cry out, That the world is the great book of God, containing three leaves, <hi>viz.</hi> Heaven, Earth and Sea, wherein there are so many characters of the wisdom of God as there are Creatures.</p>

                     <head>How to make good Greek, or other Wines out of Honey.</head>
                     <p>AS concerning the passage in my Letters concerning Honey, I cannot exactly give you an account of it, till I see all the Discourse: Thus much I remember and know by experience, that if pure Honey be gently boiled in pure water, and well scummed, and afterward cooled, and then with barm or yest set to work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as we usually do Beer or Ale, and then put into a larger vessel for a time, and afterwards drawn into pottles, that a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor hath, and may be made like fountain water, yet of such a fine excellent tast, and so strong, that some, who have thought themselves of very good pallats, have mistaken it for Greek Wine.</p>
                     <p>And I question not, but Sugar will do the like, but whether I seem to speak of any more ingenious clarifications, as with white of Eggs, with falt of Tartar, or with other things, that Vintners use for their Wines, or whither I refer them to <hi>Glauber,</hi> who in his Appendix speaketh of some ingenious fermentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and clarifications, I cannot certainly tell. But this I dare boldly say, that if any Gentleman would trie Experiments upon Honey, Sugar, yea, or any sweet things, if the sweetness be not too flashy and watry, he shall find divers things both delightful and profitable.</p>
                     <p>I hope <hi>Glauber,</hi> who hath promised divers things in these kinds, and I suppose is most able to accomplish them, will more clearly manifest them for the good and comfort of our Northern Countries.</p>
                     <p>I desire to hear what other ingenious things are written of late. I think these times very fruitful, and that the great Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:118800:33"/>
which have a long time been hid, will shortly be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested.</p>

                  <p>The meanes to increase Honey and Wax, doth properly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in the preservation of Bees, and the making of convenient Skepes or Bee-hives after a new invention: Namely, you may make your Skepes either with Straw or Wicker of Two sorts, and to be of two peices, to take off at the crown, or near the midst of the Hive; that when they have gathered and filled up their house, and that the room is scant within, then take away the upper half, and clap on a board, or the bottom, or head of a pitch Barrel, or tar barrel, or the like, having pitch on it, casting Mault meal, or Bean meal upon the same; and then daube it well with clay about the skirts, and setting on with your clay mixt with some salt; and when you have thus done, then raise it up below with so many wreythes, as you took above for the gel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of your Hives before, which is very needful to make the greater plenty and increase: For making your Skepes in this manner, the Honey may be taken at all times; but especially, when you do perceive by the lifting up of your Skepes, that your Bees are well provided for the Winters provision, and that there
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:118800:34"/>
be plenty of food yet to gather, then cap them. Take a strong wyer, make it flat, and cut your combes in two, and then have a parchment in readiness to follow the wyer, to keep asunder the wax from cleaving, laying on your board with pitch and meal, as aforesaid. This to be done in Summer.</p>

                  <p>I Have in my Legacy of Husbandry bequeathed some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing unto thee concerning Silk-worms, which hath wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned many to search after the means to advance that part of Husbandry. But because the Letter of King <hi>Iames</hi> to the Lords Lievtenants of the severall Shires of <hi>England,</hi> for the increasing of Mulberry Trees, and the breeding of Silk-worms, for the making of Silk in this Nation, had not annexed unto them in that Treatise the Instructions ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that purpose, and being but few, wholly out of print, and very much desired: I thought good upon the occasion of the printing of this Letter to those of <hi>Virginia,</hi> to publish it also for the benefit of those who shall be willing to employ themselves in this way of industry, which seemeth to be brought unto a more perfect and speedy accomplishment than heretofore hath been known either here or in <hi>France,</hi> as by the contentes of this adjoyned Letter (wherein the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a vertuous Lady of this Nation for the breeding of Silk-worms, is addressed unto the Planters of <hi>Virginia</hi>) is set forth to encourage both them and others to set upon this work, to benefit themselves and the Nation thereby. And truly the Gentleman who doth addresse this Letter to the Planters of the Virginian Colonie is much to be commended for his affection to the publick, because he doth not conceal (as some Muck-worms do for private ends) the Advantages
<pb facs="tcp:118800:37"/>
which may be reaped by singular industrious Attempts or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments of profit; but desires the benefit of others, even of all, to be encreased. And it were to be wished, that every one to whom God (from whom comes every good &amp; perfect gift) doth impart any rare and profitable Secret of Industry, would open himselfe towards his Brethren, as this publick-hearted Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman doth; then would all hands be set a work, and every one would become instrumentall to serve himselfe and his Neighbours in Love, and overcome the burthen of povertie, which for want of employment and decay of Trade, doth lie so heavie upon very many, whose burthens might be either born, or made easie, if all the gifts of God were made use of, for the end for which he doth bestow them, namely, to profit withall towards others, as it becommeth the Members of the same Christian, and Human, and Nationall Society; for the same rule holds in all these respects among such as understand what it is to be a good Commonwealths-man in the State, as well as in the Communion of Saints: And to this good and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous inclination, which I wish may more and more abound in them with the grace of God, I shall leave thee and rest,</p>

                     <head>What ground is fit for the <hi>Mulberry-seeds,</hi> how the same is to be ordered, and in what sort the seeds are to be sowed therein.</head>
                     <p>THe ground which ought to be apointed for this purpose, besides the natural goodness of it, must be reasonably well dunged, and withall so situated, as that the heat of the Sun may cherish it, and the nip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping blasts of either the North wind or the East, may not annoy it: The choice thereof thus made; that the seeds may the better prosper, and come up after they be sown, you shall dig it two foot deep, breaking the clods as small as may be, and afterwards you shall divide the same into severall Beds of not above five foot in breadth, so that you shall not need to indanger the Plants by treading upon them, when either you water or weed them.</p>
                     <p>The Mulberry seeds you shall lay in water for the space of 22 hours, and after that you shall dry them again half dry, or some what more, that when you sow them they may not cleave together: Thus done, you must cast them upon the foresaid Beds, not altogether so thick as you use to do other garden Seed, and then cover them with some fine earth (past through a Si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The time in which you ought to sow them for your best advantage, is either in <hi>March, April,</hi> or <hi>May,</hi> when frosts are either altogether past, or at the least not so sharp, or of so long continuance, as to indanger their upspring.</p>

In this sort you may suffer them to remain weeding and watering them (as need shall require) till they be grown six foot in length above their roots, whereunto when once they have attained, you may cut their tops, and suffer them to spread, alwayes having a care to take away the many branches or succours, that may any way hinder their growth untill they be come to their full length of six foot, as aforesaid.</p>

But a moneth before you do remove them, you must make the holes (wherein you purpose to set them) about four foot in breadth, and so deep as that their roots may be well covered, and some half a foot of loose earth left under them, having alwayes a special care so to place them, that they may receive the benefit of the Sun, and not to be shadowed or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-spread by any neighbouring trees.</p>

                     <p>WHen the leavs of Mulberry-trees begin a little to bud forth, take the eggs of your Silk-worms, and lay them in a piece of Say, or such like stuff, and in the day time carry them in some warm place about you, in a little safe box, but in the night either lay them in your bed or between two warm pillows, untill such time as the Wormes begin to come forth: then take a piece of paper of the wideness of the said box, and having cut it full of small holes, lay it within the same upon the eggs, and upon that again some few Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery-leaves, to which the Wormes as they are hatched, will continually come. These leaves with the Wormes upon them, you must still remove into other boxes, laying fresh leaves as well on those that are removed as on the paper where the eggs are; and this is the course which must be du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kept and observed, untill such times as all the Wormes be come forth of their shels, still keeping their boxes warm, as aforesaid; but no longer about you, but untill the Wormes begin to come forth, out of which boxes you may safely take them, when once they have past their second sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and feed them upon shelves of two foot in breadth, and 18 inches one above the other.</p>
                     <p>The said shelves are not to be placed in any ground-room, nor yet next unto the tiles, but in some middle room of your house which openeth upon the North and South, that you may the more conveniently give them either heat or aire, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the time and season shall require. Besides you must not make them close unto the Wals, but so as you may
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:118800:39"/>
passe about them the better to look unto the Wormes, and keep them from Rats and Mice, which otherwise might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voure them. You must observe the times of their comming forth, and keep every one, one or two dayes hatching by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, that you may the better understand their severall sicknesses or sleepings, which are foure in the time of their feeding. The first commonly some twelve dayes after they are hatched, and from that time at the end of every eight dayes, according to the weather, and their good or ill usage, during which time of every sicknesse, which lasteth two or three dayes, you must feed them but very little, as onely to relieve such of them, as shall have past their sicknesse before the rest, and those that shall not fall into their sicknesse so soon.</p>
                     <p>The whole time that the Worms do feed, is about nine Weeks, whereof untill they come unto their first sicknesse, give them young Mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>For the feeding of Worms you need observe no other or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der then this, lay the Mulberry-leaves upon them, and every two or three dayes remove them, and make clean their boxes, or shelves, unlesse in times of their sicknesse, for then they are not to be touched; the leaves which you take from them when you give them fresh to feed upon, you must lay in some convenient place, and upon them a few new leaves, to which the Worms that lay hidden in the old, will come, and then you may passe them with the said new lea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

to the rest of the worms: And now lest any thing should be omitted, which serves to perfect the discovery of so excellent a benefit, I will advise you to be very diligent in keeping clean their Boxes, or shelves, as being a speciall means whereby to preserve them; wherefore when you intend to do it, you shall remove them together with the uppermost leaves where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they lie, unto other boxes or shelves, for with your hands you may not touch them, till they have throughly undergone their third sicknesse, and then may you passe them gently with clean hands, without doing them any harm: provided that the party that commeth neer them smell not of Garlick, Oni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or the like. The first five weeks of their age you must be very carefull to keep them warm, and in time of rain or cold weather, to set in the room where they remain, a pan with coals, burning in it now and then some Juniper, Benjamin, and such like, that yieldeth sweet smels. But afterwards un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse in time of extraordinary cold, give them aire, and take heed of keeping them too hot, being alwayes mindfull to store the room with herbs and flowers which are delightfull and pleasing to the smell. As the wormes increase in bigness, you shall disperse them abroad upon more boards, or shelvs, and not suffer them to lie too thick together: and if you finde any of them broken, or of a yellow glistering colour inclining to sickness, cast them away, lest they infect the rest, and sort such as are not sick, the greatest and strongest by themselves, for so the lesser will prosper the better.</p>

                     <p>AS soon as by the clear amber-coloured bodies of your worms, you shall perceive them ready to give their silk, you must (with heath made very clean, or with the branches of Rosmary, the stalkes of Lavender, or such lik) make Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es between the foresaid shelves.</p>

The other bottomes which you intend to keep for seed, you must lay in some convenient warme place, untill the worms come forth, which is commonly some sixteene or twenty dayes from the beginning of their work: and as they do come forth you must put them together upon some piece of old Say, Grogeran, the backsid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <head>An Extract of a Letter from <hi>Germany,</hi> concerning Silk-worms, written to <hi>S.H,</hi> Esquire.</head>
                     <p>AS for keeping of Silk-worms I must confess I have spent likewise some time in the ordering and observing of them inasmuch as this very yeare (1653) I have had from them so much good Silk (and equal to that which is brought either out of <hi>Persia</hi> or <hi>Italy</hi>) as have made mee two paire of Stockings. And I have found by experience that they may be kept as well in <hi>Germany</hi> as in other Countries, and that Mulberry-trees will grow in abundance upon our Lands; wherefore I have often wished that the Emperour (of <hi>Germany</hi>) would follow the most laudable example of the K. of <hi>France,</hi> who having forbidden the importation of foraigne Silk into his Kingdom hath thereby so much obliged the industry of the People of <hi>France,</hi> that they are come to a great perfection in this Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Manufacture. But concerning the Experiments of making Silk out of Nettles or out of Flax, I never have tried either of them. Only I remember that I have seene once a very fine and delicate yarne or thred, which was made purely out of Nettels. I do not believe that those Artist of <hi>Hamburg</hi> and <hi>Wolfenbuttel</hi> which you have named unto mee in your Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, will communicat their Skil for a publique good, as long as they can get their own comfortable subsistance by it.</p>

                     <head>A Letter written by Mr. Ra. <hi>Austen,</hi> from <hi>Oxford,</hi> Febr. 18. 1654. Imparting his Experiments about Silk-worms and how to wind off the Silk from the Bottoms, when the Worms have done spinning?</head>
                     <p>COncerning my experiences about Silk-worms, I only say thus much. That I am fully satisfied upon good and sure grounds that the keeping of them (store of them) in these parts would be of very great profit, could we but get Mulbery leaves sufficient to feed them. For upon my own knowledge and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience (last yeare) upon some thousands of them, I see what
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:118800:41"/>
might be by more. For my great doubt and question was sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied about the winding of the Si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ke from the Bottoms, when the Worms have done spinning. I plainly see it is very easy, Children of 6. or 7. yeares old can apprehend it, and do it. For the Worms having done spinning, which is within 4. or 5. dayes of their beginning, through out-most silke is ravelled off, and the end is found immediately, which runnes on (5. or 10. or 16. or more bottoms together) in a bason of water, a little gum drag mixed. Some Bottoms (if the Worms were strong and well fed) run without breaking, scarce once or twice till all be off, and such as break, are quickly found again. The truth is, if the Worms are scanted of leaves, their silk is so small, that it holds not so well as that of lusty Worms. I saw many brave Skains of Silk wound off the last yeare, and help't to do part of it my self. Now the great matter is, How to propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate Mulberry-trees enough. As for the ordinary way, by boughes, we can have but few that way. I am from time to time experimenting other wayes by Seed, Inoculating, Graft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp;c: what will be the result, as yet I know not: I doubt not, but God will in his good time bring to light and set on foot many good and worthy designes, more then are in these Nations. We had need to labour to be of the like Principles of that worthy person, whose Paper you enclosed, patiently and humbly to waite the Lords season, and to designe for God in all we go about, which will crowne our endeavours with comfort and success.</p>

And these Gentlemen are confident, that you did not know &amp; practise those ways and meanes, for the feeding and preservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them, as in some far remote Regions is practised by those Nations, that are expert Masters of Silk-wormes, <hi>Virginia</hi> would instantly abound with great store of Silk, and surpass all those Countreyes in that rich commodity, and you all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with great speed and small cost, or li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <div type="item">
                     <head>Hearken well to these Informations, which the Lady earnestly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires may thus be with all speed made known to you all.</head>
                     <p>THe one Traveller declared, That he passed a Countrey where he saw those people had their Silk-worms feeding on their Mulberry-trees in the fields &amp; there they live &amp; spun their Bottoms on the trees, And to protect this noble profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table creature &amp; to defend it from the birds, they used a most slight, simple, plain invention speedily effected &amp; of no cost or labour to them, which was certain great sheets of Reeds or Canes, that they hung over and about their trees, tied to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain poles that incompassed them. And in this easie manner they obtained great abundant quantities of silk, to their won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful inriching. The sheets of Reeds were joyned together by a neede and thred, running through each Reed at several equal distances, and so drew them close and firm together. This for you to imitate, is in every respect to your wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full happiness.</p>
                     <p>Another of these Travellers saith, That he passed a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey where the inhabitants did make large Tents or Boothes all of Reeds and Canes, and in them placed shelves and tables made likewise of Reeds, on which they fed their Worms, strewing leaves on them. These tents they set up round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their Mulberry-Groves, and with much celerity, and no cost.</p>
                     <p>A third Gentleman and Merchant, that lived long in the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:118800:47"/>
farthest parts of <hi>Turkey,</hi> affirmeth, That there the inhabitants begin every Spring, <hi>March,</hi> to feed their Worms, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue it till <hi>October,</hi> six moneths time: their Worms hatching &amp; re-hatching, one generation or brood succeeding the other: so that they have three harvests of silk-bottoms, in that space of time, every five or six weeks one: they feed their Worms in great long Barns made of Reeds or Canes, the walls and roofs of them, and shelves as aforesaid, and the Wormes when they have done feeding, spin their bottoms upon the reedy walls and roofs; and that they have two crops of leaves from their trees: for those trees that have their leaves pull'd off in <hi>March, April,</hi> and <hi>May,</hi> do re-leave again, and have new and fresh leaves in <hi>Iune, Iuly</hi> and <hi>August,</hi> wherewith they feed their latter generation or brood of Wormes very profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably.</p>
                     <p>And in confirmation of this, you shall know, the same hath been found true in <hi>England,</hi> that the Mulberry-tree will leave twice in a Summer, the Lady had the experience of it, and therefore much more will it do with you, which will be a most singular advantage to you.</p>
                     <p>I must not omit to add what these Gentlemen farther ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise, that you can never sufficiently augment the store of food for this Noble Creature: for store of food is the main foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, upon whose speeding the Silk-trade is to be erected: for if that be not wanting, no obstruction can be in it. For the glorious Worm is so infinite in multiplication, with that celerity as is incredible, so that she will never be defective unto you: they therefore counsell, that you graft your Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berries with all care and speed upon these severall trees, upon which they will exceedingly thrive, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Popler,</hi> the <hi>Elme,</hi> the <hi>Chesnut, Beech, Quince, Medler, Fig, Peare, Apple,</hi> and <hi>Cornell</hi>-trees. And also upon any other trees, of which upon a trial you find the Worm will taste or eat their leaves. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise that you set of your Mulberry-slips as big as your thumb, about two foot long: and put them into good wel-digg'd ground in <hi>September,</hi> setting them a foot in the ground, brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the ends of them, and watering them the next Summer well, if need be: in the same manner as in <hi>Kent,</hi> they set the

Codling-slips. That you also cause the <hi>Indians</hi> to bring unto your habitations all the young Mulberry-trees that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in an hundred miles of your Colony. But let me acquaint you that they admire what some Gentlemen Planters of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit tell them; that your brave Wormes do not onely live, feed, and spin upon the Mulberry-trees in the Woods, but do the same upon the <hi>Poplar</hi>-trees, <hi>Plum</hi>-trees, and <hi>Apple</hi>-trees:<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> such an incouragement to the <hi>Silk-trade,</hi> the World (say they) never yet heard of before, which must needs lift you up to a most speedy and incomparable height of wealth and riches, in a moment of time.</p>
                     <p>And by your gentle patience and generosity, give me leave to propound unto you, the earnest request the Lady hath to all of you; that you please to inform her (being also the desire of many others) how it comes to pass that your Wormes get to your severall trees, not only to the <hi>Mulberry,</hi> but to others: For in no other Countreys the <hi>Silk-worme</hi>-flie doth use her wings to flie with: so that yours must either do it (and so at time of yeer couple and flie to sundry trees; and there lay their eggs which remain till Spring again) or that your trees do naturally ingender and produce the Wormes (as it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, the original of them so hapned at first) but which way soever it be, it's rare and remarkable; and proves <hi>Virginia</hi> to be one of the most superlative Countreys in all the Vniverse for the <hi>Silk-trade</hi>; and none comparable unto the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of its naturall temper for <hi>Silk.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then that you also inform her all you can of the nature, actions, qualities and dispositions in all kindes of this most wonderfull Creature, every way so admirable, what by any <hi>English</hi> or <hi>Savage</hi> hath bin any way observed in her: when her eggs first hatch, then how long time she is feeding before she spins, upon what part of the trees she fastens her Bottom; How long she continues in her Bottom before she comes out a Fly, then when they couple, where they lay their eggs, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what part of the trees? How long they live after that time? For these in the old World never eat after they once begin to spin: how large in bigness and compass are commonly their bottoms? if all of one colour, or divers? In what part
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:118800:48"/>
of the Countrey are most of them seen and found? what do the <hi>Savages</hi> call them, or know any use of them; what birds are they that most devoure them? (for did they not, they would swarm all the Land over in a very few yeers); if any thing besides birds be hurtfull to them? Their greatness and doubleness of their Bottoms are wonder<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

A great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to you all that she is not a nice curious kinde of <hi>Silkworme</hi>; but stout and robustous, that will require little care or attendance, of small cost unto you. But her food and protection is all she requires, and pays you ten thousand-fold for what you bestow on her. That you please to send of her Bottoms to satisfie all men, who are like the Queen of <hi>Sheba,</hi> much better trust their eyes than eares; some of their eggs likewise upon that which they lay them, and the Fly (though dead) which will many a yeer retain her perfect form in a box: do not the wormes hatch and spin twice or thrice in a Summer?</p>
                     <p>Let me add one Petition more, and I have done. <hi>viz.</hi> That some of your precious Silk-grass may be sent the Lady, who is confident upon the triall she will make of it, she will give you so pleasing an account and so profitable unto you, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king known unto you what an unknown wealth you have: she prays you (and all is for your own gain) to bore and cut all your trees (a most easie thing) and thereby you shall discover presently, what rich Gums, what Balsoms, what Oils, and precious healthful Liquours they will yield you for profit &amp; necessity: For all men know that many kindes of trees do yield most pleasant and healthsome Wines (as I may call them) for man to drink; so also you will finde out all sorts of Dies and Colours (instantly done): cut and bruise all kindes of your Woods, Barks, and Leaves of Trees, Roots, Berries, Nuts, Fruits, Plants, Weeds; and but boil them in a Skillet, and then put in a little piece of white Woollen or Linnen cloth with some Allom, and you shall instantly finde and see what rich Colours they will make.

                     <p>Now where Worms and Food abound naturally, and the Inhabitants are born with Brains, the advancement of the Silk Trade must needs be proportionable: upon which double score <hi>Virginia</hi> hath the advantage of any place in the yet dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered World; I mean for Worms and Food, which may be thus severally demonstrated. Their Worms (partly annually
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:118800:50"/>
produced by heat and moysture as our Caterpillars and other Insects each Spring, partly by Eggs which have escaped the Birds who are the greatest cause of their scarsity (which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise would swarm over all the Land) devouring them when they are Worms, Eggs and Bottoms) exceed ours not only in strength, hardinesse and greatnesse, (being when Flyes as big as mens Thumbs) but also in the largenesse of their Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, which are as big as Limons; (for Mr. <hi>William Wright</hi> of <hi>Nansamond</hi> found of them above seven inches round) and one of them weighs more then a score of ours; insomuch that whereas a Thousand of our Worms made but one pound of Silk, worth at most here 30s. a pound, a thousand of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Worms will make ten pounds of Silk, worth here twenty shillings the pound. And certainly they need not object or be troubled at the somewhat more coursnesse of their Silk, since they from the same number of Worms receive ten pounds in mony for our thirty shillings.</p>
                     <p>As for their Food, the <hi>Virginia</hi> Worms feed not only on the Mulberry (their sole food in all other parts of the World) but also on the Crab, Plum, Poplar; Oake, Apple, Cherry and Pohickerry-tree leaves, with sundry other shrubs and bushe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. For proof whereof, Mistresse <hi>Mary Ward</hi> sent over to her Couzen ten bottoms taken from Apple trees. Esquire <hi>Ferrar</hi> her Kinsman likewise sent her ten more, pulled off from Oaks and divers shrubs. Mr <hi>Laurence Ward</hi> some taken from the Pohickerry tree, Mr <hi>Wright</hi> from the Cherry tree. So Dr. <hi>Russel</hi> and others.</p>
                     <p>The Objection, or rather groundlesse surmise of the Worms being hurt by Thunder in <hi>Virginia,</hi> is sufficiently cleared, not only by the Natural Worms living so well, and thriving there so admirably on the trees; but also by trial made there this Spring of our Worms. That ever to be honoured Noble Squire <hi>Diggs</hi> having (at his very great charge) sent for two <hi>Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> out of <hi>Turky</hi> skilful men, and made ten pound of Silk, which had not want of Eggs hindred him, would have been so many Thousand pounds.</p>
                     <p>Nothing then wants to make <hi>Virginia</hi> rival <hi>Peru</hi> for wealth, more then to perswade the Planters to provide themselves this
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:118800:50"/>
Winter (to lose no more time) of as many of the Natural Worms bottoms as possibly they can. They will now be found in the Woods on the dis-leaved trees, though most of them are spun by the Worms on the tree leaves, which falling to the ground, they perish with them; and this is another great cause that so few bottoms are to be found. The Bottoms thus gotten must be carefully kept in some long boxes till the Flyes come forth, happily in February or March. For they remain in their bottoms 300. dayes, ours but 20. so that their Eggs (whereof one female will lay a spoonfull, suppose 500.) lye unhatched but about nine dayes, ours nine moneths.</p>
                     <p>When your Worms are hatched, you may keep them either on the trees (being assured that they will live on that kind of Tree whatsoever it be from whence you took your Bottoms) and then you shall need onely to protect them from the Birds; or else in some slight kind of housing, Reedy arbors, Indian mansions, or what else you can devise there cheapest and spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diest, and then your onely labour and care is to give them leaves, which you may either strip off, or clip from off your Trees, or if you will, lop off little branches (which may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps prove a good way for you: for thereby the leaves will remain the longer fresh) and give them to your Worms, who for the labour of every Man and Boy thus inployed only in two moneths time, will repay you with three<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>MY good Cosen Mr. <hi>W.</hi> sent me the letter, you wrote to him; and the note sent you out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> that intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the happy success the Gentlewoman had then in keeping Silk-worms, not only on the Mulberry-tree-leaves, but with Lettice leaves, the thing you much desired that my Daughter should have made known unto her. Truly Sir your singular humanity and goodness in all things more and more extends it selfe for the publique benefit of all, and I see to the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar satisfaction of your Freinds, though Strangers to you yet those that have daly cause more and more to honour you, as we justly do. Sir, this your favour is both by my-self and Daughter so much resented as it requires from us, very hearty and particular thanks to be tendered to your worth. She is a lover of Rarities in these kinds, and to try conclusions upon her Silk-worms, and no way envious, but much rejoyces to heare that any have had that good success with Lettis as you write of, and shall her-self againe make a third triall in that kind, for she hath 2. yeares last past tryed her-self to have kept some with Lettice leavs &amp; so did &amp; they thrivd as well as they kept with Mulberrys, but stil when the time of spinning came they would not spin, but then dyed and this put her out of heart to try further, yet I may tell you, she perswaded a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman near her to keep some with Lettice 25. daies and then fed them with Mulberrys at last, and these did very well and spun as good Bottoms as those wholly kept with Mulberry

                     <p>And now Sir she presents this printed inclosed paper to your worthy judgment, if you find not it matter of considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and reason for her to send it as a second new yeares gift to <hi>Virginia,</hi> hoping that it may do good there to the Planters and informe them of much truth; and invite them to the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Silk, which God grant; <hi>Amen.</hi>

                     <p>TObacco requires 9 moneths time, much care and labour, both without and within dores, and a mans Crop is commonly 15 hundred weight of To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco, and this at two pence a pound is 14 pound gain.</p>
                     <p>Silk requires six weeks time, if done in a house, and by the labour of a man and boy, in gathering leaves, and tending the worms that come of six ounces seed, there is by so many worms spun as much Silk as will weigh sixty pound weight, and this but at 20 <hi>shil.</hi> a pound, yeelds 60 <hi>l.</hi> in ready money.</p>
                     <p>Tobacco, leaves a man but 3 moneths in the year for other business.</p>
                     <p>Silk, leaves a man ten moneths time in the year, for any other imployments.</p>
                     <p>14 pounds a man gaines by his Crop of Tobacco.</p>
                     <p>60 pounds a man and boy gains by his Crop of Silk.</p>
                     <p>Then let all men judge which is the more gainfull.</p>
                     <p>But what will be the gain and profit, by the worms feeding and spinning on the Trees is more considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and also the naturall <hi>Virginia</hi>-worms bottome exeeding ours in <hi>Europe</hi> 20 times in bigness, and in weight: what a Treasure then will this be, and no labour, cost, hazard, expence of time at all, a Boy onely to keep away the Birds from eating the Silk-worms on the Trees, &amp;c.</p>
