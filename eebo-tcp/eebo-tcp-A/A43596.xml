            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

have perpetrated the moſt daring vices that any

taught that God was a naturall power endued with divine
reaſon; and then again, he called him a Divine neceſſity.

ſpeak of one <hi>Theodorus,</hi> ſirnamed <hi>Atheos,</hi> the Atheiſt:
He affirmed the gods to be meer ioies, and not worthy of
divine honours, that would perſwade men by their exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
to theft, perjury, and rapine. <hi>Protagoras Abderita</hi>
was of opinion, That it was not lawfull to enquire con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the gods, whether they were or were not, or of
what nature and quality. <hi>Xenocrates Chalcedonius,</hi> made
eight gods; in the wandring ſtars the number of five, in the
whole number of the Planets, one, a ſeventh in the Sun, an
eighth in the Moon. <hi>Plato Athenienſis</hi> went more divinely
to work; who taught that it is neither the aire, nor reaſon,
nor nature, but that there is one only God, by whom alone
the world was faſhioned, and made perfect, and miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.
<hi>Zenophon Socraticus</hi> held argument, That the form of

immortality to things meerly mortall. <hi>Ecphantus
Siracuſanus,</hi> as <hi>Erigines</hi> relates of him, imagined the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity

the Indian wiſe men, or Sophoi) called it the Light; but
not as the ſplendour of the Sun, or Air, but the light of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
by which wiſe and underſtanding men might enquire
into the dark and myſticall ſecrets of nature. <hi>Lactantius</hi>
and <hi>Cicero</hi> ſay, that it was the opinion of the Stoicks, for the
moſt part, That this inſtrumentall power was a divine
ſubſtance, intelligible and airy, but wanting form; yet to be
tranſhap'd, or made like to whatſoever it beſt pleaſed it
ſelfe. The ſame Philoſophers attributed a god-hood to the
ſtars, and all other coeleſtiall bodies. <hi>Heraclides Ponticus,</hi>
thought the World and the Mind both divine, and was of
opinion, that this form of the Deity was mutable, reducing

we promiſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Heſiod</hi> hath left to memory, that there are no

world, and every one have ſeveral predominance over men,
beaſts, fiſh, fouls, and al other creatures vegetative and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive.
<hi>Tertullian</hi> ſpeaks of three hundred <hi>Joves</hi> or <hi>Jupiters</hi>
counted by <hi>M. Varro.</hi> Therefore it was not permitted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the Romans, to adore any other gods or goddeſſes,
then ſuch as were approved and allowed by the Senate. In
the books of the high Prieſt, it was thus written: Let no man
bring in an innovation of any new gods, or aliens, to be
privately adored, unleſſe they be publickly approved; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſuch as have from antiquity been held coeleſtiall, and
unto whom Temples and Altars have been conſecrated;
let none elſe have divine worſhip. The Heathen of old
amongſt their goddeſſes, counted theſe <hi>Pudicitia, Concordia,
Mens, Spes, Honor, Clementia,</hi> and <hi>Fides;</hi> that is, Baſhful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
Concord, the Mind, Hope, Honour, Clemency, and
Faith. <hi>Pliny</hi> writes of a Temple in Rome, dedicated to
Honor. Certaine living creatures, and other things, were
in the old time reverenced as gods. The Trogloditae (as the
ſame author teſtifies) worſhipped a Tortoiſe. The Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians
had in honour, Garlick and Onyons; they have the
Crocodile likewiſe in divine adoration, to whom they offer
Sacrifice: But the Ombytae, chiefly a people of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
by whom he is held moſt ſacred; and if it ſo happen
that their children be by him devoured, the parents rejoice,
imagining they are ſpecially beloved of the gods, that are
thought worthy to beget food to pleaſe their appetites.
Serpents are honoured by the Phoenicians. In Gadeta a
City of <hi>Spain,</hi> two Temples were erected; the one to Age,
the other to Death: to one as the Miſtreſſe of Experience;
to the other, as a quiet harbor or ceſſation from all miſeries
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57230:12"/>
and calamities. In other Cities were the like inſtituted to
Poverty, and to Fortune; leſt the one ſhould afflict them,
and that the other ſhould favour them, Floods likewiſe
and Rivers, were eſteemed as deities, ſome portrai'd in the
figure of men, and others in the ſemblance of beaſts. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the Lacedemonians as <hi>Plutarch</hi> relates, Temples
were edified, one to Feare, another to Laughter, a third to
Death. The Aegyptians worſhipped the Sun and Moon, the

ſhe is the goddeſſe of Wiſdome, Diſcipline, and
Arms, and therefore called <hi>Bellona,</hi> and therefore tranſlated
into the number of the gods, becauſe the invention of
arts and ſciences are attributed to her. The places ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated

in Attica; in Aracinthus, a place in Aetolia, from which
(as <hi>Statius</hi> writes) ſhe was called <hi>Aracinthia. Pliny</hi> ſaith,
that Nea, one of the Iſlands called Cyclades, was pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
to her. But Athens was her place of moſt honour,
which City ſhe is ſaid to have built. From thence ſhe
hath the name of <hi>Athnaea, Attica, Cecropia,</hi> and <hi>Moſopia,
Horace Carm. lib.</hi> 1. The great City called Alcomeneum,
ſcituate in Boeotia, hath likewiſe by the Teſtament of the
firſt founder ſubmitted it ſelfe to her patronage. Of <hi>Scira,</hi>
a Prophet of Elucina, ſhe was called <hi>Sciras.</hi> The ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation
of her feſtivals, were called Panathenea. There
were certaine wreſtling contentions, which <hi>Theſeus</hi> in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,
firſt inſtituted to this goddeſſe, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered.
She had likewiſe her <hi>Quinquatria</hi> yearly celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
which were kept ſacred five daies after the black day,
(and therefore ſo called) the black day was immediately
after the Ides: In her ſacrifices it was their cuſtome to offer
a Goat, becauſe as <hi>Pliny</hi> hath left recorded, The biting of
the Goat is prejudiciall to the Olive tree, whoſe fruit <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerva</hi>
beſt loveth; the very licking of the rind with their
tongues makes it barren. She ſlew the beaſt Alcida, a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
that from his mouth and noſtrils breathed fire. <hi>Aelianus</hi>
writes, that when <hi>Alexander</hi> brought his army againſt The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes
(amongſt many other prodigies) that the image of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerva,</hi>

from that place ſhe was called <hi>Minerva Aſſeſſia.</hi> From

Greece, paſſing by Troy, and being peruſing the antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
thereof; and upon his departure thence, at the Altar of
<hi>Minerva,</hi> he ſacrificed a thouſand oxen one day. Many
things are fabled of her by Poets, as of her contention in
weaving, with <hi>Arachne,</hi> which I purpoſely refer to her ſtory
as it fals in courſe. She is the Hieroglyphick of Wiſdome,
and therefore the Poet <hi>Martianus</hi> writes that ſhe was born
without a mother, becauſe that in women there is ſcarce any

                  <p>That the former writers might demonſtrate unto us,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57230:19"/>
That humane actions are not altogether ſo governed by
the force coeleſtiall, but that there is ſome place left open
for mans prudence, and wiſedome; and beſides, to deliver
unto us, how acceptable the knowledge of good things is
to him who is the giver of all graces: they therefore left
this expreſſion to poſterity, that Wiſedome was the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and born without a mother, ſince God is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wiſe, and men not ſo, but meerly in a ſimilitude or ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow.
Therefore to manifeſt the power of Wiſdome, they
feigned her to come into the world armed, becauſe the wiſe
man reſpects not the injuries of Fortune, nor puts his truſt
in any worldly felicity, further then by counſell and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to ſubdue the one, and moderate the other; ſtil pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
his hopes in that fountaine from whence ſhe firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded.
Next, becauſe the feare of the Lord is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of Wiſedome, ſhe is ſaid to have combated Giants,
the ſonnes of the earth: ſuch as in that Gigomantichia,
would have pluckt <hi>Jupiter</hi> out of his throne; by which are
intended the preſumptions of nature, and the inſolencies
of men; who, all ſervice and adoration to the divine
powers neglected, are not affraid to make inſurrection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
heaven it ſelfe. I may therefore conclude, that all
humane wiſedome different againſt the divine will, is vain
and contemptible, ſince the good man is onely wiſe, and in
the grace and favour or his Maker.</p>

mountain Haemus, uſed dogs in their oblations. Of her
Temple at Epheſus, it ſhall not be amiſs to ſpeak a word
or two by the way. <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his book <hi>De vitando Aere
alieno,</hi> ſaith, that the Temple of <hi>Diana</hi> was a Sanctuary,
wherein all debtors were ſafe from their creditors. As the
Veſtals of Rome had the time of their ſervice diſtinguiſhed
into three parts; in the firſt to learn the myſteries of <hi>Veſta;</hi>
in the ſecond to do the ceremonies; and in the third, to
inſtruct others that were ignorant: So amongſt the Prieſts
of <hi>Diana</hi> in Epheſus, the firſt order of them gave them the
name of <hi>Melieres,</hi> that is, to be capable of the Prieſthood,
but not admitted; the ſecond was <hi>Hieres,</hi> that was in preſent
office; the third <hi>Parieres,</hi> that was dead from the ſervice.
This ſtately and magnificent ſtructure was firſt erected by
the Amazons, ſo beautifull and ſacred, that when <hi>Xerxes</hi>
had with ſword and fire waſted and demoliſht all the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Aſia, he ſpared only that, as the richeſt jewell of the
world. It is reported of one <hi>Heroſtratus,</hi> a wicked and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch'd
fellow, who finding in himſelfe nothing good to
preſerve his memory, and willing that his name ſhould
live to poſterity, ſet this Temple on fire, for no other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
but that he would be talkt on: the Epheſians under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
this his malicious ambition, they made it death
once to name him. <hi>Cornelius Nepos</hi> writes, that the ſame
night that this famous ſtructure was ruin'd and defaced by
fire, <hi>Alexander</hi> was born in Pella, in the three hundred and
eighth yeare after the building of <hi>Rome:</hi> ſo that at the

<hi>Diana</hi> being a goddeſs, would ſuffer her Temple to be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
deſtroied? and what ſhe was a doing the while? It
was anſwered again, That it was done unawares to the
goddeſs, for ſhe was that night at the labour of <hi>Olympias,</hi>
and buſied about bringing <hi>Alexander</hi> into the world. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding

But to apply theſe things to our better uſe, and
ſhew that all theſe Divine attributes beſtowed on this god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe
were heatheniſh, and abſurd, I hold opinion with
<hi>Plutarch lib. de Fortuna,</hi> That wiſedome guideth the life and
actions of man, not Fortune. Was it by Fortune (ſaith he)
that <hi>Ariſtides</hi> lived in poverty, when it was in his own pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to purchaſe wealth? or that <hi>Scipio</hi> having taken Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:57230:25"/>
neither ſaw the prey, nor took part of the ſpoile?
That <hi>Philocrates</hi> having received ſo many Talents of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexanders,</hi>
ſpent them upon ſtrumpets, and fiſhes. That
<hi>Laſthenes</hi> and <hi>Euthycrates,</hi> by propoſing to themſelves no
other felicity, than the throat and belly, loſt Olynthus?
If theſe things be attributed to Fortune, we may as well
ſay, Cats, Goats, and Apes, are by chance given to voraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
luſt, and ſquirility. If all things be attributed to fortune,
what can be deviſed? what learnt? what Cities govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
could ſubſiſt? or what Kings counſell be managed
without providence, and wiſedome to direct it? did For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
ſway all? Many brute beaſts are better furniſht in
their nature and condition than man; ſome are arm'd with
horns, ſome with teeth, ſome with prickles, not ſo much as
the Porcupine, nay, the Hedge-hog, but as <hi>Empedocles</hi>
ſaith:
<q>Dorſum horret ſpinis &amp; ſpicula torquet actua.</q>

to mans uſe: The dog is a beaſt, fierce and cruell, yet
his ſervant and keeper; with the Forreſts beaſt, the Airs
foul, and the Seas fiſh he feeds and banquets: what beaſt
is greater then the Elephant? or to behold, what more ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible?
yet to him he is a ſpectacle of pleaſure, like a play
in a publick Theater? <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> ſaith, That bruit beaſts
excell man in all things, yet whatſoever they have, man
applies to his own uſe; he gathers the honey from the Bee,
and drawes milk from the Cow; yet in all this Fortune
hath no hand, only Counſell and Providence. Look but

                  <p>THe Dryades had predominance over the woods and

Hamadriades were the <hi>genii</hi> of every particular tree; and
as <hi>Callimachus</hi> in a Hymn to <hi>Delos</hi> witneſſeth of them, they

and periſh as they rot and wither: their number is

<hi>Tythorera;</hi> in <hi>Arcadicis,</hi> a ſecond, <hi>Erato;</hi> and a third, <hi>Phiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia.
Claudianus</hi> in <hi>laudibus Stiliconis,</hi> reckons them ſeven.
<hi>Charon Lampſacenus</hi> produceth one <hi>Rhaecus,</hi> who in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie
of Aſſyria, having a goodly faire oake, whoſe earth
ſhrinking from the root, and being ready to fall; as he
was propping and ſupporting the tree, and ſupplying the
decaied mould about it, the nymph or genius of that tree,
which was to periſh with it, appeared to him, and after
thanks for ſo great a courteſie, bid him demand of her what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever,
and it ſhould be granted, ſince by the repairing of
that plant ſhe was ſtill to live: He taken with her beauty,
demanded liberty freely to embrace her to his own fill and
appetite, to which ſhe inſtantly yielded. <hi>Apollonius</hi> in his
<hi>Argonaut,</hi> tels of the father of one <hi>Paraebius,</hi> who going to
cut down an ancient faire oake that had ſtood many years,
a Nymph in like manner appeared unto him, humbly pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioning,
that he would ſpare the tree for her ſake, ſince
the age of it, and her, and the lives of both, were limited
alike: which he refuſing, ſo enraged the other of her fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes,
that many afflictions befell both himſelfe and his
poſterity. <hi>Mneſimachus</hi> ſaith, that they are called Dryades,
becauſe in their oaks their lives are included; and Hama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driades,
becauſe they are born with them; and <hi>Iſacius</hi> the
interpreter of <hi>Apollo,</hi> becauſe they periſh with them. I will
conclude theſe with one tale recited by <hi>Charon Lampſace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus:
Archus</hi> (ſaith he) the ſon of <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Caliſto,</hi> being
chacing in the forreſts, incountred one of the Hamadriades,
who told him how neer ſhe was to ruine, in regard that the
river running by had eaten away the earth from the root
of ſuch a goodly oak (to which ſhe pointed) and that by
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:57230:42"/>
ſaving that, he ſhould preſerve her: at her intreaty, he
turned the ſtream another way, and ſupplied the root with
earth; for which this Nymph, whoſe name was <hi>Proſpetia,</hi>
granted him her free imbraces: of whom he begot <hi>Philatus</hi>
and <hi>Aphidantes.</hi> Whether theſe relations were true or falſe,
is not much to be diſputed on; if falſe, they were for no
other cauſes deviſed, but by the ſuperſtition of the people
of ancient daies, who left nothing unmeditated that might
ſtirre up men to the adoration of the divine powers, ſince
in every thing they demonſtrated a deity. If they were ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

and ſtill the naturall faculties are in action. If then
the body be ſo fertile, how much more is the nobler part of
man, the Soule and the Mind, plentifully furniſht with
theſe ſeeds, that long for production? as the inſtinct of
manners, of arts, of diſciplines, and ſuch like, which are
generated in the breaſt, and in their fit and due time have

but none at that age acquires after things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known.
It is therefore a conſequent, that there is born
with us and bred in us, certain notions of thoſe outward

our ſelves to apprehend any problem or myſticall doubt,
which is not within the compaſſe of our preſent capacity;
after deep conſideration, and mature deliberation, all the
bars and rubs of our fantaſie and ſences being removed,
we retire our ſelves into a more private and inward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation,
and then moſt ſubtilly reaſoning with our
ſelves, we ſhall by degrees perceive the cloud to vaniſh, and
the truth appeare in full glory and ſplendour. Therefore
when we preſent our ſelves unto ſchool Maſters, the brain

With this ſhort preparation, we come now to the Muſes, of

they comprehend the Art of modulation or tuning,
with a conſent or agreeing of all other diſciplines. Divers
authors much differ about their number, <hi>Varro,</hi> as <hi>Servius</hi>
witneſſeth of him, allowes only three, <hi>Ina,</hi> which is bred by
the motion of the water; a ſecond, begot by the ſprinkling of
aire; a third, meerly ariſing from the ſound of the voice.
<hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſpeaks of a City, which <hi>Gyraldus</hi> names Sicyon,
the primates of which, of three ſeverall famous workmen,
beſpake three effigies or images of the <hi>Muſes,</hi> to beſtow

that their three labours were equally beautifull, and ſo
eſteemed, inſomuch, that all the nine pieces pleaſing gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,
they were all bought and dedicated to the Temple.
To every of which, the Poet <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Emblem or Motto: Not (ſaith he) becauſe <hi>jupiter</hi> had
begot nine Muſes, but that three Artificers had forged
three a piece; and therefore the number of three, becauſe
it is eaſie to obſerve, that every ſound which begets any
materiall thing concerning muſick, is tripartite by nature:
either it proceeds from the voice ſimply, as to thoſe that
ſing without an inſtrument; or with the breath, as the
Trumpet, Cornet, or Sackbut; or by the ſtrokes, as the
Lute, Harp, or Gittern. The names of theſe Statue-makers,
<hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, were <hi>Cephiſodotus, Strongilio,</hi> and <hi>Olimpioſthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.
Pauſanias</hi> relates, that in times of old, there were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
no more then three, (by <hi>Oto</hi> and <hi>Ephialtes</hi> the

<hi>Archeſtratus</hi> the Poet, affirms as much; as alſo, that
theſe two were the firſt that offered divine ſacrifice to the
Muſes, and impoſed theſe names upon them in Helicon.
Some authors will approve but two; others will make them
up foure, for the excellency of the number, which the Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoriſts
held to be ſo ſacred, that by that (as <hi>Plutarch</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies)

That by the ſymbole or ſemblance of ſuch women, much
ſcience is begot, and beſides much fruit ariſeth from the

fitted the coupling and ſiſterhood of the ſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
theſe coherences are called by <hi>Martianus Capella, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clicae;</hi>
from whence <hi>Vitruvius</hi> grounded his <hi>Euciclium:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,

to the great honour of the feminine ſex; the four parts
of the world have their denominations from women. Aſia
was ſo called of the Nymph <hi>Aſia,</hi> from whom and <hi>Japethus,

the like female figure; which (as <hi>Beroaldus</hi> ſaith) if
the women of our age did fully apprehend, and truly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,
how inſolently would they boaſt of their worth
and dignity? how would they glory in vain boaſts and
oſtentations, with what continuall chidings would they
upbraid their husbands, ſtill caſting in their diſhes their

that women bear the names of all the foure parts of
the divided world; that wiſedome and the Theologicall
Vertues, are perſonated under the ſex or women; that the
Arts, the Diſciplines, the Muſes, the Graces, and almoſt
whatſoever is good, are deciphered both by the names, and
in the perſons of women: therefore (I fear) this had been
better kept as ſecret as myſteries in Sanctuaries, and not

intimated in this Nymph <hi>Clio:</hi> She is called the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and ſignifies glory. If it be lawfull therefore
to acquire glory, and to leave the memory of your noble
actions to poſterity, far be it we ſhould ſeek the daughter
but from the father, or court her without his conſent; who
from the memory and contemplation of a deed well done,
derives to us a fame, in no age not to be celebrated. She is
called <hi>Prima cogitatio,</hi> i. The firſt thought of ſeeking know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;
and becauſe no mans meditations are about that
by which he hath not a purpoſe to inlarge the dignity of
his own name, therefore ſhe is called the firſt of the Muſes.
<hi>Plutarch</hi> in his <hi>Sympoſaicon,</hi> divides the nine Muſes into
two halfes; the one to govern and have dominion over
paſtimes and pleaſures, leſt any man ſhould fooliſhly and
unadviſedly fall upon actions diſhoneſt or uncomely, ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
them up with ſongs, dances, and ſweet ſounding inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
to vertuous exerciſes; and reteining and keeping him
back from luſts, both unlawfull and pernitious: the other
diviſion incourages us, to actions difficult, to affairs ſerious
and of import; and theſe are <hi>Clio, Calliope,</hi> and <hi>Thalia:</hi> for
all things ought to be done in <hi>Symmetria</hi> and due propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of mediocrity, that in our ſports we ſlide not into luſts,
and in things ſerious, wee ſtumble not at the moroſity and

                  <p>EVery man hath his pleaſures and delights, as well wiſe

of ſome one thing or other. One is much pleaſed with
horſes of good ſtomack, another with dogs of excellent
ſcent or ſwiftneſſe, ſome with wealth, others with honour,
and ſo of the reſt; and thus we paſſe through the pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
of a life full of infelicities and calamities, with the
greater content and caſe by pondering ſome ſuch things
in our minds, in which we take the greateſt pleaſure
and comfort. Neither are the wiſe men without this ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity,
being ſometimes extaſi'd in the contemplation of
things ſublime and high. <hi>Plato</hi> in <hi>Philebis</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>As the
intemperate man takes pleaſure, ſo doth the temperate man in
his temperance; As the fool is delighted in his fooliſh opinions

purpoſes; but that their contents are different, and of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
qualities, no man makes queſtion.</hi> The wiſe man there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and the unwiſe, have both their pleaſures, but ſo far
pre-excelling is the one, as the other is vile, abject, and
contemptible: for the one is gorged and ſurfeited with his
delicacies, even to loathing and vomit; the other, inebriated,
or rather quickned and inſpired with the ſprightly nectar
of contemplation, flies into the celſitude and majeſty of
things inſcrutable; neither conteins he himſelfe within
the narrow and ſtreight empire of this univerſe, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
things above capacity, and tranſcending nature; for
incited with the deep ſtudy of metaphyſicall Philoſophy, he
ſtrives even to trace the ſteps of infinite majeſty, though it
be confeſt that this ambition of his, is both fooliſh and arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant,
yet is it daring, and noble, that not ſatisfied with the
knowledge of humble and terrene things, pierceth deeper,
and aimeth higher, till it attain that perfection of height,
that the mind or underſtanding being filled, may ſtop at
the fartheſt, as there having fixt <hi>non ultra.</hi> But this ſmall

that <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> ſhould be her ſon, when at a ſolemn

his words, <hi>As in times of old to play upon the Harp at meetings

the Greeks, was after certain great victories atchieved,
where they were in great opinion of themſelves; but they
were after relinquiſht in Athens, either becauſe they were
held as inciters to wanton meetings, or becauſe they raiſed
a kind of uncomelineſſe and deformity in the faces of ſuch

                     <hi>BY ſweet modulation, all things are moved. Plato</hi> in his
dialogue <hi>de Furore,</hi> cals her the daughter of <hi>Jupiter,</hi>
and voice of <hi>Apollo;</hi> nor without merit, if we but retire our
ſelves, and look back into the originall of things. Her name
derived from the Greek dialect, importing <hi>Canere,</hi> to ſing;
and <hi>Concentum facere,</hi> to make conſeat or concord; which
includes the temperature and modulation of the whole
world. For what is better moderated or kept within a more
due proportion, then melody: For as the many limbs and

members of the body, though they have divers place and
motion, and have ſundry gifts and offices, yet all their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
are directed to one buſineſſe, as having one ſcope
and aime: ſo the variety that ariſeth from divers voices or
ſtrings, all agree and meet to make one melody, which as
<hi>Plutarch</hi> writes in his book <hi>de Muſica,</hi> ſignifies a<note n="*" place="margin">Melos.</note> member

with harmony, <hi>Plaeto</hi> doth gather, becauſe the coeleſtiall ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
from which the world firſt took life, had his firſt lively
being and exiſtence from muſick. <hi>Strabo</hi> writes that the
Elephants are made gentle, by the voice and the beating of
the timbrell, or the tabor. And <hi>Plutarch</hi> in <hi>Sympoſiac.</hi> That

                  <p>Therefore it was the cuſtome in all the Tragedies of old,

which ſignifies the ſweetneſſe of the voice: for one of the

in things coeleſtiall, which by how much they are
above things terreſtriall in excellence, they are ſo much
the more difficult. Some ſtretch the influence of the ſtars to
<hi>Zoriaſta's</hi> magick, in which he was popularly famous, nay
more, his name by that art enobled. notwithſtanding, the
annals teſtifie that he was ſubdued and ſlain in battell by
<hi>Ninus. Pompey</hi> the great was curiouſly addicted to theſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinations;
yet his potency fail'd him, and he dyed a wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched

to be inferred as the myſticalleſt and powerfull part of the
Mathematicall Diſciplines. The inventions of <hi>Manilius</hi>

would have all that contemplate Aſtrology, to begin in

that Aſtrology is a moſt wiſe ſecret:</hi> for it is neceſſary,
that the true Aſtronomer be not that man (according to
<hi>Heſiod)</hi> that ſhall only conſider the riſing and ſetting of the
ſtars, but rather, that hath a full inſpection into the eight
compaſſes, or circumferences, and how the ſeven are tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the firſt, and in what order every ſtar moves in his
own ſphear or circle; in which he ſhall not find any thing
which is not miraculous. If therefore the praiſe of Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy

who firſt illuſtrated the art? This only ſhall ſuffice, that

                  <p>THere are two things in the mind chiefly predominant,<note place="margin">Plat in Gor.</note>
Knowledge and Diſpoſition, which as <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith, are in
continuall and reſtleſſe motion. Knowledge, which by the
Sophiſts under a colour of truth, is abuſed, with things falſe
and erroneous; and Diſpoſition or Affection, which temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the popular Poets, under a bait of delight and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
ſwallowes the hook of many perturbations and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions;
thoſe Orators that are merely ſuperficiall and
not ſeen in the grounds of wiſedome, corrupted with idle
and vaine reaſons, they delude the knowledge, and with
unneceſſary curioſities precipitate the affection. From So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſts
we muſt altogether beware, as peſtiferous and infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious;
from Poets and Oratours, in ſome kinds, but not in
all caſes. <hi>plato</hi> confineth Sophiſters every where and from
all places, and Poets too, but not all; ſuch only as comment
falſe and ſcandalous tales of the gods; nor theſe from all
places, but from the Cities only that is, from the ſociety of
of young men, and ſuch as are ignorant, prone to perturba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and not capable of the allegoricall ſence included:
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:57230:64"/>
admitting only ſuch as ſpeak well of the gods, ſing divine
Hymns, and bravely regiſter the acts of noble and illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious
perſons; Such is the practiſe that <hi>Calliope</hi> teacheth
her Poets; which practiſe as <hi>Ficinus</hi> witneſſeth, is nothing
but the rapture of the ſoule, with a tranſmigration into the
majeſty of the Muſes. This Poeſie rouſeth us from the ſleep
of the body, to the awaking of the mind, from the darkneſſe
of ignorance to the light of knowledge, from death to life,
and from dull oblivion to a contemplation divine and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly:
But where the wit failes, there is no help to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
from the invention, for it is no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> within the compaſſe
of mans capacity to compaſſe deep and great matters in a
moment, for all knowledge is inſpired from above. And
ſince Poetry comes not by fortune, nor can be attained to
by art, it muſt conſequently be a gift from the gods and Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.
For when <hi>Plato</hi> names the god, he intends <hi>Apollo;</hi> when
the Muſes, he underſtands the ſoules of the ſpheares; for
<hi>Jupiter</hi> is the mind of the deity, who extaſies and illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates
<hi>Apollo, Apollo</hi> the Muſes, the Muſes, the Poets, the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets
inſpire their interpreters, the interpreters make impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
in the auditors. By divers Muſes, divers ſouls are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned,
as it is in <hi>Timaeus,</hi> that ſundry ſouls are attributed
to ſundry ſphears. The Muſe <hi>Calliope,</hi> is a voice reſulting or
rebounding from the ſound of the other ſphears, and of the
reſt the moſt excellent,<note place="margin">L. 2. Theog.</note> who is not only a friend of Poets,
but the companion of Kings, as <hi>Heſiod</hi> ſaith;
<q>
                        <l>Calliopeque &amp; haec excellentiſſima eſt omnium,</l>
                        <l>Haec enim &amp; reges venerandos comitatur</l>

He makes her the mother of <hi>Orpheus,</hi> and to inſpire him as
<hi>Vrania</hi> did the Poet <hi>Muſaeus; Clio, Homerus; Polyhimnia, Pyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darus;
Erato, Sapho; Melpomene, Thamyras; Terpſichore, Heſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus;
Thalia, Virgilius; Euterpe, Pub. Ovidius.</hi> Thus the nine
Muſes, who have reference and hold correſpondence with
the nine coeleſtiall ſounds, make one harmony and conſent
by inſpiring nine illuſtrious Poets; Amongſt them <hi>Calliope</hi>
is held to be the moſt ancient. Ancient likewiſe is Poeſie,
whoſe invention is given to <hi>Calliope,</hi> as to the Championeſs
that defends the ſtandard of the Muſes. Beſides <hi>Orpheus,</hi>
ſome ſay ſhe had two other ſons, <hi>Ialmus</hi> and <hi>Hymenaeus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> of

who was the firſt Poetiſer of unchaſt venery. She is alſo ſaid

the <hi>Syres</hi> the daughters of <hi>Calliope,</hi> others of <hi>Melpomene:

Venus</hi> (becauſe <hi>Orpheus</hi> the ſon of <hi>Calliope</hi> diſcovered <hi>Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi>
whom ſhe had delivered to <hi>Proſerpina</hi> to be ſix months
concealed) gave him to be lacerated and torn in pieces by
the Thracian women. But now to ſearch what was chiefly
aim'd at by the Poets in this Muſe <hi>Calliope:</hi> It appears that
by her they apprehended the ſweetneſſe and modulation of
ſong, as taking her denomination <hi>à bona voce,</hi> of a good and
tuneable cleer voice; therefore ſhe is called <hi>Vox deae cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantis,</hi>
The voice of the calling goddeſſe; from which they
gave her the dominion over the perſuaſive art of Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick
and Poetry. The generall tractate of the Muſes, ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
only at this, That the firſt thing requiſite, is to have
a will to knowledge and learning; the ſecond, to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
in that will; the third, to be conſtant in that we
delight; the fourth, to attain to that in which we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant;
the fifth, to commemorate that which we have attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
the ſixt, to make ſimilitude and compare what we have
commemorated; the ſeventh, to judge of thoſe likes which
we have made and compared; the eighth, to make electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of ſuch things as thou haſt judged; the laſt, eloquent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to ſpeake, and facundiouſly to delate of that thing of
which before thou haſt made election. So much <hi>Fulgentius.</hi>
And thoſe no doubt that have long and much exerciſed
themſelves in theſe diſciplines, and have been the devout
adorers of the Muſes, the daughters of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
themſelves as well in the gentler Sciences as the hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
myſteries of Philoſophy, ſhall not only by their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
attain to the perfection of fame and glory, but
purchaſe to themſelves incredible joy, pleaſure, content and
delectation.</p>
                  <p>A word or two of the Muſes in generall, and ſo conclude
with them. They are held to be the ſoules of the Sphears:
<hi>Vrania</hi> of the ſtarry heaven, and of that Sphear which is
called <hi>Aplanes; Polybimnia</hi> of <hi>Saturn; Terpſichore</hi> of <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
Clio,</hi> of <hi>Mars; Melpomene,</hi> of the Sunne; <hi>Erato,</hi> of
<hi>Venus; Euterpe,</hi> of <hi>Mercury; Thalia,</hi> of <hi>Luna.</hi> Theſe eight
Muſes are referred to the eight tones of the ſphears; from

which is ſaid to be next to the ſeat of the ſupreme dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
are ſaid by <hi>Heſiodus</hi> to dance about the Altar of <hi>Jupiter.</hi>
But becauſe divers and ſundry are the ſtudies of theſe Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
therefore by their influence the minds of mortall men

                  <hi>ISiodorus</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Lib. 4.</note> that the word <hi>Sybilla</hi> is a name of place

Thought. So that <hi>Sybill</hi> comprehends a woman that had
gods thought: For as a man that propheſieth, is called a
Prophet, ſo a predicting woman is called a Sybill. Of their
number the ancient writers much differ. <hi>Aelianus</hi> in his

ominous to women with child, and to infants ſucking at

in times of old they were moſt frequent and common, when
the world attributed too much to the jugling illuſions of

waies conceives the ſpirit by which ſhe propheſies, either
by a ſoft breath, or elſe by fire proceeding from the mouth
of a certaine den or cave; before the entrance of which ſhe

               <p>
                  <hi>Colephonius Zenophanes</hi> hath denied, that there can be any
divination at all, but <hi>Democritus</hi> hath approved it: of the
ſame argument <hi>Chryſippus</hi> hath writ two books, one of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
another of Dreams. <hi>Diogenes Babylonius,</hi> publiſht one
<hi>De divinatione, Antipater</hi> two, <hi>Poſſidonius</hi> five. <hi>Panaetius</hi> the
ſcholler of <hi>Antipater</hi> doubted whether there were any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe
at all to be given to that art or no, <hi>Cicero</hi> is of opinion,
that it hath only power over ſuch things as happen acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally
or by chance. Of divination there be two ſorts, one
of art, as by the entrails of beaſts, or by caſting of lots; the
other of nature, as by dreams and viſions: in both, the
conjectures made by vaticinations, aim at more then they
can accompliſh, and intend further then they can proceed.
Further, this art is by the Greeks called <hi>Mantices,</hi> that is,
the knowledge of things to come; the firſt inventers thereof
were the Aegyptians and the Chaldeans, by their obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the ſtars. The nations of the Cilici, the Pyſidauri,
and the inhabitants of Pamphylia neer unto theſe, predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
by the ſinging of birds. The Magi among the Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
had many aſſemblies of purpoſe only to augurate and
to divine: but all ſuch are condemned of ignorance and
want of art, who preſage meerly by concitation and rapture,
without the help of reaſon and conjecture. <hi>Sagire</hi> ſignifies
to perceive acutely or ſharply; therefore they are call'd <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaces</hi>
that know much: he that is ſaid <hi>Sagire, viz.</hi> to know
before things come to paſſe, is ſaid <hi>Praeſagire,</hi> that is, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage.
It is called Divination, when it extends to a higher
degree of prediction. But when by divine inſtinct (as in the
<hi>Sybils)</hi> the mind is as it were tranſported and extaſi'd in
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:57230:67"/>
rapture, it is then called <hi>Furor,</hi> or fury. Amongſt the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurians,
a people of Thrace, it was a cuſtome for their
Prieſts before they would demand any thing from the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
to glut and gorge themſelves with ſuperfluous exceſſe
of wine: The <hi>Clarii</hi> contrary to theſe in their ſuperſtitions,
uſed to quaffe great quantity of water. The Divination
that was made by water, was called <hi>Hydromantia:</hi> That
which was made by an Axe or Hatchet, was ſtiled <hi>Axino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantia:</hi>
That which was made by a Skin in which water
was moved to and fro (from whence a ſoft and gentle voice
of preſage was heard to breath) was called <hi>Leconomantia:</hi>
That which did conſiſt of certaine points and marks fixed
in the earth, <hi>Geomantia:</hi> That which was gathered from
Figures and imaginary ſhapes ſhining in the fire, <hi>Pyroman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia:</hi>
The Divination by ſmoak, was called <hi>Capnomantia:</hi>
That which was derived from skipping ſhadowes in a mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
or glaſſe, ſeeming to leap this way or that, <hi>Capyroman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia:</hi>
That which was apprehended from Braſſe, <hi>Aroman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia:</hi>
that which was begot from a Sive, <hi>Coſchinomantia:</hi>
That which came by Lots, <hi>Cleromantia:</hi> That which was ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
from the Aſpect or Countenance, <hi>Phyſiognomia:</hi> The

from <hi>Batanomantia:</hi> that which was apprehended
from a great big-bellied Veſſell into which children were
ſet to look and tell what they ſpi'd therein, <hi>Gaſtromantia:</hi>
It is called <hi>Augurium</hi> or <hi>Auguri,</hi> from Birds: and <hi>Extiſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum,</hi>
from the intrails of Beaſts. <hi>Phavorinus</hi> upon <hi>Gellius</hi>
ſaith, that he would have no faith nor beleefe at all given
unto theſe Divinations, arguing in this manner, Either
(ſaith he) they muſt preſage Proſperity or Adverſity, and
bad or good fortune: If they promiſe good and faile us,
we are made miſerable in our expectation; if proſperity
to come, though it happen in the proceſſe of time, in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim,
time ſpent in hope of it, ſeems irkſome and tedious; if
they prognoſticate Adverſities, and lie, yet are we made
wretched in our feares; if Miſeries to come, and lie not, we
are firſt excruciated in our minds, before we be once toucht
by the hand of Fate, and by that means doubly ſuffer. <hi>Mart-Cappell.</hi>

a Doctor in Grammer, and a man of approved truth
and fidelity; he reports that in his travell by ſea towards
Italy, he hapned into a ſhip laden with Merchants goods,
and full of paſſengers of divers nations: In the evening,
being juſt againſt the Echinadae, they ſailed afore the wind,

admiration of them all) called upon the name of one <hi>Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus:</hi>
this <hi>Thamus</hi> was in Aegyptian, and his name ſcarce
known to any in the ſhip: twice he was call'd, but anſwered
not, but at the third ſummons breaking ſilence, theſe words
with a loud voice were uttered: Thamus, <hi>when thou arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt
at the Palodes, tell them there that the great</hi> Pan <hi>is dead,
Epitherſes</hi> reported that theſe words put them into an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall

and it being long diſputed, Whether it were neceſſary that
this command ſhould be performed or omitted? But <hi>Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>
thus reſolved, that if the wind ſtood faire, he would
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:57230:69"/>
not alter his courſe, but paſſe the Iſland, but otherwiſe he
would deliver the meſſage according as he was injoined.
Comming neer the Palodes, their ſailes were on the ſudden
becalmed, for neither wind was felt to blow, nor tide or wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
perceived to move; which he perceiving, turned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
towards the Iſland, and made this loud acclamation,
<hi>The great god</hi> Pan <hi>is dead:</hi> which words were no ſooner ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,
but a great intermixture of howling, yelling and
mourning, was heard from the Iſland, to the infinite amaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

witneſſes, that the rumor thereof ſpread ſo far as Rome,
even to the ears of <hi>Tiberius Caeſar,</hi> by whom <hi>Thamus</hi> being
ſent for, he related the circumſtance in the preſence of the

the great Generall; but the Cumaeans would not deliver
him up without adviſe from the Oracle. There was in thoſe
daies an ancient and much adored Altar, ſacred to <hi>Apollo,</hi>
to which the Aeoles and the Ionians in all their heſitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
repaired for counſell; it was ſcituate in the Mileſian

who anſwered, <hi>Let him be ſurrendred up:</hi> which
when the men of Cuma heard, they with a joint ſuffrage
concluded to ſend him thence, and to obey the Oracle. To

For then were no Empires extant, which after were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant

age was the golden and moſt flouriſhing; becauſe the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

moreover, it bred many wiſe old men, full of the divine

of the Arts and Sciences. The ſecond time was numbred
from the Circumciſion to Chriſts comming in the fleſh, and

being born of a Virgin; which conteins little leſſe than
two thouſand years, and that is under the Law. The third

it is for our ſins, which are many and great, for which
mankind ſhall be the ſooner deſtroi'd, and Chriſt for his

                  <p>Of theſe wonders briefly,<note place="margin">That 60000 men were 20. years in building.</note> to make her divination the
more plaine. Of theſe Pyramides there were divers, of
which the greateſt took up eight acres of ground, parted
into foure angles, each equally diſtant eight hundred eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
foot, and in height twenty five. A ſecond, foure an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles,
every one containing by even ſpaces, ſeven hundred
thirty and ſeven foot. A third, comprehended three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
ſixty three foot betwixt every angle. A fourth ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
by <hi>Rhodope</hi> the ſtrumpet, the miſtreſſe of <hi>Aeſop,</hi> by the
monie which ſhe got by her trade. <hi>Herodotus</hi> ſpeaks of a
Pyramis made by <hi>Cleopys</hi> King of Egypt, of ſtones ferch'd
from Arabia, whoſe length was five furlongs, the breadth
ten paces. He erected a ſecond more magnificent, which
was not not finiſht in twenty years, upon which he ſpent
ſo much treaſure, that he was forc'd to proſtitute his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
a moſt beautifull young virgin, to ſupply his own ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity.
<hi>Pliny</hi> reports, that in this ſtructure he imploied ſo
many workmen, that they eat him 1800. talents in onyons
and garlick. 2. The Tower of Pharos, built by <hi>Ptolomaeus,</hi>
in that Iſle, which ſerved as a lanthorn to direct Navigators
by ſea in the night; he ſpent upon it 5300. Talents; <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrata</hi>
was the Architectour, as appears by the inſcription of
his name upon the Cittadell. 3. The wals of Babylon
were built by <hi>Semi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in thickneſſe fifty cubits, in height two hundred, within the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:57230:77"/>
compaſſe of which, were an hundred Ports, having brazen
gates that all mov'd upon hinges; they were beautified with
three hundred Turrets, and Chariots might meet upon the
top of them, and have free paſſage without impediment.
4. The Temple of Diana, of which I have ſpoken before,
was in length 425 foot, in breadth 220. It was beautified
with 127. Columns. 5. The tombe of <hi>Mauſolus,</hi> built by
<hi>Artimeſia</hi> Queen of Caria, was in height 25. Cubits; it was
compaſt with 36 Columns; it contained from the South
to the North, 33. foot, the whole compaſſe contained 1411.
That part which lay towards the Eaſt, was perfected by
<hi>Scopas;</hi> that which was towards the North, was ended by
<hi>Briax;</hi> that towards the Meridian, by <hi>Timothaeus;</hi> that which
butted upon the Weſt, by <hi>Leocares.</hi> 6. The Coloſſus of
the Sun, which beſtrid the River Rhodes (betwixt whoſe legs
ſhips without vailing their top-ſails, came into the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour)
was of that vaſtneſſe, that a man with his ſpread arms
could not compaſſe his thumb, every finger being as big
as a common ſtatue. After it had ſtood ſix and fifty years, it
was emoliſht by an earthquake. The Souldan of Egypt
having invaded Rhodes, with the broken braſſe thereof,
laded thence 900. Camels. The chiefe workman was <hi>Chares
Lindius,</hi> the ſcholler of <hi>Licippus.</hi> 7. The image of <hi>Jupiter,</hi>
to which ſome equall the Pallace of <hi>Cyrus</hi> King of the
Meads, built by <hi>Memnon,</hi> the ſtones of which were cemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
together with gold. But I leave further to ſpeake of
theſe, and proceed to the next Sybill.</p>

if by chance at any time that ſacred fire was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed,

upon the ſame negligence, by <hi>P. Licinius Craſſus,</hi> then
in the high Prieſthood. All ſuch as were found guilty of

neither ſuch an one whoſe parents, one or both, have lived

neither ſhe whoſe father is a Flamin, a South-ſaier, or one
of the <hi>Decemviri</hi> in the ſacrifices, or of the <hi>Septemvirate</hi> in

daughters of Kings, and Prieſts, as uncapable of this mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery:
neither can that mans child be admitted that hath
not a known houſe and an abiding place in Italy, for ſo <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pito
Atteius</hi> writes: ſo likewiſe the children of all ſuch as
are reſtrained, as have the number of Three, or more. By
the edict of the Praetor, that no Virgin Veſtall or Dialis
which belongs to the ſacrifices of <hi>Jupiter</hi> ſhall be compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to any thing; theſe be the words of the Praetor by the
mouth of the crier: Through all my juriſdiction I will not
urge or force an oath from the Veſtall Virgins, nor from the
Flamin Dialis: in the chuſing of the Veſtall theſe things
were obſerved. There is a caution by the law called <hi>Lex Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia,</hi>
That by the approbation of the chiefe Prieſt, and by
his ſpeciall appointment, twenty virgins were ſelected out
of the people; but this ordinance with many other, were
abrogated and aboliſht by Time, inſomuch that it was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient,
if any of free parents and honeſtly deſcended, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioned
or made means to the high Prieſt, ſhe might with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
more difficulty enter her oath, and be admitted into the
ſacred order; being received by him as one ſnatcht and
taken violently from the hands of her enemies. The words
he uſed were theſe, This veſtall Prieſt, whom I enter into
this holy office, according to the inſtitution of the beſt law,
I receive by the name of <hi>Amata,</hi> to make her interceſſions
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:57230:79"/>
for the Nobility and people of Rome. It was a cuſtome to
admit them all by the name of <hi>Amata,</hi> becauſe ſhe that was
firſt choſen by King <hi>Numa</hi> was ſo called; and with theſe Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
ſhe was as it were hurried to the Temple of <hi>Veſta.</hi>
In <hi>Labeons</hi> commentaries it is thus found recorded, <hi>The Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtall

that dies inteſtate; her goods likewiſe after her death return to

which <hi>Mars</hi> vitiated <hi>Illia</hi> the mother of <hi>Romulus.</hi> Theſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
of <hi>Veſta</hi> were tied to an oath of perpetuall viginity;
for it was a cuſtome among the Latines, to make choice of
the moſt noble and chaſt virgins. After many years <hi>Romu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>
deviſed all the chaſt ceremonies belonging to that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
and as <hi>Varro</hi> declares to us, created threeſcore Prieſts
to thoſe publick ſervices, ſelected by their Tribes and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
but of the moſt noble and unblemiſht ſtocks amongſt
the Romans: The Temple of <hi>Veſta</hi> is built round, and is
betwixt the Capitol and the Palace; in this is kept the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall
fire; for the Etymology of <hi>Veſta</hi> is nothing elſe,

that Temple, are kept the remembrances of many, both ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred

to Prieſts and Virgins. Some ſpeak of two tuns of no
great quantity, the one continually ſhut, the other open and
empty; ſome of the Virgins have reported, that the Palla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium
that fell from Heaven, and was received into Troy,

are greater ornaments to a woman than gold or jewels;
and becauſe all perfections cannot be in one woman at one
time, this Modeſty is that which ſupplies all things that
are wanting. It is a dower to her that hath no portion, not
only an ornament to deformity, but in blackneſſe it impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes

of <hi>Seſoſtris</hi> King of Aegypt, moſt skilfull in divination,

<hi>Volatteranus</hi> in <hi>Georg.</hi> writes of one <hi>Labiſſa,</hi> a divining wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
that was eminent for many predictions in Bohemia,
whom ſucceeded her daughter <hi>Craco,</hi> as well in skill, as in

her appointment celebrated many ſacrifices; her the Senate
with a generall ſuffrage for her approved skill in augury,
rewarded with liberty, making her a free woman of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
<hi>Polyxo</hi> is the name of one of the Phebaiedes; of whom
<hi>Val. Flaccus</hi> in his Argonauts thus writes:

<hi>Spurina,</hi> who as <hi>Tranquillus</hi> teſtates, forewarned <hi>Caeſar</hi> to

Capella</hi> ſpeaks of one <hi>Symachia,</hi> and cals her one of the
Sybils; and often by all authors granted, will allow but
two; namely, <hi>Herophile Trojana</hi> the daughter of <hi>Marmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,</hi>
and <hi>Symachia</hi> the iſſue of <hi>Hippotenſis,</hi> who was born in
Erythraea, and prophefied in Cuma. <hi>Theano</hi> and <hi>Eucyppa,</hi> the
daughters of one <hi>Scedaſus,</hi> ſung many oraculous cautions,
to the people of Sparta, yet could they not predict their
own diſaſter; for after they were forcibly defloured by the
young men of the ſame City, and ſlain, and their bodies caſt
into a well; their father after long ſearch finding them,
confounded with the ſight of ſo ſad a ſpectacle, upon the
ſight thereof ſlew himſelfe. <hi>Caelius</hi> writes of a woman born
in his Countrie, called <hi>Jacoba,</hi> out of whoſe belly unclean
ſpirits made acclamations of future things to come; of
which one of them called himſelfe <hi>Cincinnatulus,</hi> who gave
marvellous anſwers to ſuch as demanded of him, but ſpake
as oft falſely as truly. Of better knowledge (as it ſeems)
was <hi>Apollonius</hi> of Tyana, a City in Greece, who told one <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix,</hi>
a man given to all volu ptuouſneſſe, That before three
daies were expired, he ſhould be ſlain; which accordingly
hapned. He uſed to proteſt, that he ſpake nothing without
the counſell of the gods, and direction of the ſpirit that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
him: he profeſſed the knowledge of all languages
and tongues, to have inſight into the thoughts of men, to
diſcourſe any thing punctually that had paſt, and divine as
truly of any thing to come; he was moreover an exact in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter
of dreams: his life is compendiouſly ſet down by
<hi>Vollatterranus. Parialla</hi> lived in the age of <hi>Cleomines,</hi> and was
called the championeſſe of all the Delphian Propheteſſes.
Now how the Devill ſhould come to the foreknowledge of
things to come, it ſhall be held no unneceſſary digreſſion
briefly to inquire. Theſe ſpirits being of a thin ſubſtance (by
their tenuity, ſubtilty, and incredible celerity, moreover,
by the quickneſſe of their apprehenſions, in which they far
excell the ſlowneſſe and dulneſſe of all earthly bodies) by
the divine permiſſion, underſtand and deliver many things
which appear to us miraculous:<note place="margin">Cap. 8.</note> Therefore S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in
book <hi>De Spiritu &amp; Anima,</hi> ſaith, That by reaſon of their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:57230:82"/>
and benefit of the length of time (as having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
from the beginning of the world) they have gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to themſelves, that abſolute and unmatchable experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
of which man (by reaſon of the brevity of his age) is
no way capable, by which means ſome of their actions ſeem
the more admirable: ſome things they faſhion out of the
holy Scriptures themſelves, as having them all at their fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
ends, and oft times predict ſuch things as they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
have purpoſe to act; by this means tempting and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
mankind. Therefore <hi>Plato</hi> in <hi>Epinomide,</hi> attributes
unto them,<note place="margin">Lib. 4.</note> acuteneſſe of wit, retentive memory, and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
knowledge. <hi>Clemens</hi> in <hi>Recog.</hi> ſaith, That theſe ſpirits
therefore know more, and much more perfectly, as not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
burdened or dulied with the groſſe weight of the body.
<hi>Tertullian</hi> in his Apology againſt the nations, thus argues:
All ſpirits are winged,<note place="margin">Cap. 22.</note> and therefore are every where in an
inſtant; the ſpatious earth, and all the corners thereof, are
to them but as one place, and whatſoever is therein done,
they can as eaſily know, as ſuddenly declare: by this means
they make themſelves the authors of many things; and ſo
they are indeed of miſchiefs often, of good things never.
The Croeſians and the Pirrhians make it moſt apparant,

to the Graecians. The Prince thereof comming to the Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phian

                  <note place="margin">Antiquit.</note> 
                  <hi>Alexander</hi> had inveſted his army before Tyrus, the

confeſſeth the truth, but not with the intent to move the

                  <hi>Johannes Wyerius</hi> in his firſt book, <hi>De praeſt. Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
tels us, that upon a time mention being made of <hi>Hector</hi>
and <hi>Achilles</hi> before the Emperour <hi>Maximilian</hi> in his impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall

                  </gap>ſe, extolling their actions, ſtrength,
and valour, in that high meaſure, that the Emperor was
moſt deſirous (if it were poſſible) to behold them in their
true effigies and portraiture. A Magician at the ſame time
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:57230:83"/>
lived about the Court, who boaſted ſo much of his skill, that
he profeſt himſelfe able to accompliſh the deſires of the
Emperor, and that without danger or prejudice to any:
this comming to the eares of the Emperor, he was ſent for,
and commanded to ſhew ſome teſtimony of his art. The
Magician in hope of reward, and promiſe of ſilence, free
from all interruption, undertakes it, and moreover to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
the ſpectators from danger: when placing the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
in his regall throne, he caſt about the ſame a wide
and ſpatious circle, that done, he mumbles certaine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
words to himſelfe, which he ſeemed to read out of
a ſmall book of characters, which he drew out of his poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket.
This was no ſooner done, but <hi>Hector</hi> beats at the door
with ſuch violence, that at the terrour of the ſtroaks, the
whole pallace ſeemed to tremble: the door being open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>Hector</hi> enters armed <hi>Cap a pe</hi> in a helmet plumed, his
target upon his arme, and in his right hand a long mighty
ſpeare, headed with braſſe: who thus accoutred, with ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
and flaming eies looks round about the room; his
ſtature much larger then any that hath lived in our latter
daies. At another door, firſt knocks, then enters <hi>Achilles,</hi> with
the like majeſtick gate, compleatly armed, with an auſtere
and menacing brow, beholding <hi>Hector,</hi> ſhaking and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
his ſpear againſt him, as if he inſtantly purpoſed to
invade him. Theſe two, after honour done unto <hi>Caeſar,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
gone on, and returned back three times, upon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant

harp, but his aſpect more plauſible, and his countenance
more amiable then the former: he likewiſe three ſeverall
times paſt by the Emperor, ſtill ſitting in his throne, but
without any reverence done to his perſon at all, and ſo
likewiſe vaniſht. The Magician being asked by the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
Why, of the reſt, <hi>David</hi> had only denied to do him
honour? he preſently anſwered, That all Kingdomes to
the Kingdome of <hi>David</hi> muſt ſubmit themſelves, becauſe
Chriſt himſelfe came of his ſtock and linage. Thus we ſee
how the devill is never without Scripture in his mouth,
though blaſphemy and execration in his heart. Beſides
theſe kind of Diviners, there are ſuch as are called <hi>Sortili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gae,</hi>
and theſe predict by lots, and that after ſundry maners,
of which I will inſtance one only: They make a round cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:57230:83"/>
and divide it into four and twenty equall diſtances, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the number of the Greek alphabet, every ſpace
having the character of one of theſe letters, upon which
they put a graine of wheat or barley; then is put forth a
Cock kept for the purpoſe, and by thoſe grains that he picks
up from the letters, they make their conjectures. <hi>Valens</hi>
the Emperour much perplexed in his mind about the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
in the Empire, retired himſelfe to this kind of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gury:
when the letters and the grains being placed as is
aforeſaid, the vaticinating Cock (called <hi>Alectiomantious)</hi>
was turned out, who pickt up the grains, and made bare
theſe five letters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> THEOD; by which was ſignified <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odoſius,</hi>

out of the ſentences of the Poets; but eſpecially out
of <hi>Homer</hi> of the Greeks,<note place="margin">Iliad. 5.</note> and <hi>Virgil</hi> for the Latines. <hi>Socrates</hi>
being in priſon, out of a verſe in <hi>Homer</hi> told to <hi>Aeſchinus,</hi>
That he ſhould not outlive the third day. <hi>Alexander Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>

                  <q>Tu regere imperio populos, Romane memento.</q>
And after ſome few years he attained to the Empire. <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi>
the Emperor acquiring his own fate the like way, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
upon that in his ſixt book of his <hi>Aeneid:</hi>

next to the ſea in the furtheſt Weſt, brings Apples of the
colour of Gold; whoſe opinion <hi>Lucan</hi> followes. With three
of theſe Apples was <hi>Atlanta</hi> the daughter of <hi>Scoeneus</hi> van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſht,
which <hi>Venus</hi> gave to <hi>Hippomines,</hi> when ſhe was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
the reward to the victor, and death to him that was
overcome: but more plainly to reduce theſe fables to hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
It is probable, that there were two brothers famous and
renowned in theſe Provinces, <hi>Heſpereus</hi> and <hi>Atlas,</hi> that were
poſſeſt of ſheep beautifull and fair, whoſe fleeces were yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
and of the colour of gold. <hi>Heſperus</hi> having a daughter
called <hi>Heſperia,</hi> conferr'd her on his brother <hi>Atlas,</hi> of this
<hi>Heſperia</hi> the region was called Heſperitis. By her, <hi>Atlas</hi> had
ſix daughters, and therefore they had a double denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
from him <hi>Atlantides;</hi> from her <hi>Heſperides.</hi> Their beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
being rumour'd far off, it came to the ears of <hi>Buſiris,</hi>
who deſirous of ſo rich a prey, ſent certain pirats and rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
with a ſtrict command, by ſome ſtratagem, or elſe by
force to ſteal them thence, and ſo to tranſport them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the compaſſe of his dominions. Theſe Damoſels ſporting

ſurpriſed and borne thence which hapned juſt about the
time that <hi>Hercules</hi> combatted <hi>Antaeus:</hi> theſe Virgins being
ſhipt away, the pirats went on ſhore to repoſe themſelves
with their prey upon the beach; of which <hi>Hercules</hi> having
notice (who had heard before of the rape) he ſallied upon
them, and ſlew them all to one man, returning the Virgins
ſafe to their father, for which he received not only a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
of thoſe ſheep (the reward of ſo great a benefit) but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other courteſies; amongſt other things he inſtructed
him in Aſtronomy, and to diſtinguiſh of the ſtars: which
knowledge <hi>Hercules</hi> firſt bringing into Greece, he was
therefore ſaid to eaſe <hi>Atlas,</hi> and in his ſtead to ſupport hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

daughters of <hi>Heſperus,</hi> which ſignifies the evening. And
they are ſaid to have gardens in the Occident, which brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
froth golden Apples, by reaſon the colour of the ſtars
are like gold, and their orbs round as apples, neither

               <p>OF the parents, or names of the Houres, there is ſmall

               <p>
                  <hi>Orpheus</hi> not only aſſents with him in their names, but ads

                  <hi>Ovid</hi> cals them, the porters to the pates of heaven.
They are deciphered, to have ſoft feet, to be the moſt ſlow
paced of all the goddeſſes, yet ever to produce ſomething
new; for ſo <hi>Theocritus</hi> reports of them. <hi>Homer</hi> in his Iliads
rels us, that they are not only placed to keep the gates of
heaven, but have power at their pleaſure over faire or
foule weathers, calling it an open skie when the aire is
faire and cleare and a ſhut heaven when the welkin is dark
and cloudy, as may appear in theſe words:
<q>
                     <l>Sponte fores Coeli patuerunt, &amp;c.</l>
                     <l>The gates of Heaven did of themſelves ſtand wide,</l>
                     <l>Thoſe which the virgin hours are ſet to keep</l>
                     <l>(As their great charge.) The Poles they likewiſe guide,</l>
                     <l>With all the upper regions. From the deep,</l>
                     <l>The ſhowers exhal'd they ſtore: and when they pleaſe,</l>
                     <l>The borrowed raine pay back into the ſeas.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>They are called <hi>Horae</hi> of the Greek word, which ſignifies
<hi>Cuſtodire,</hi> or to keep; and therefore ſaid to be the guardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
of heavens gates, as having power to admit of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions,
and give them acceſſe unto the gods, or otherwiſe
if they be not faithfull and ſincere, to exclude them at their

great favourers and proſperers of all ſuch as are labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:57230:88"/>
and ſtudious. They are called the daughters of <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
and <hi>Themis,</hi> becauſe as the Graces import nothing elſe
but the hilarity and gladneſſe that ariſeth from the increaſe
of the earth, ſo theſe Houres ſignifie the fruit it ſelfe; for the
Greek word, <hi>Carpo,</hi> is <hi>Fructus:</hi> properly then they are ſaid
to be the attendants of the Graces, as the Graces are ſtill
the handmaids of <hi>Venus,</hi> for the fruits of the earth are the
increaſe, as that plenty ſtill followes delight: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they all equipage together, as being by the Poets never
ſeparate Beſides, the names of the Hours are thus properly
Engliſhed, Law, Juſtice, and Peace. The abundance of all
things is the companion of Vertue and Honeſty: but Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
and Dearth are the pages to Irreligion and Impiety:
for there is not a clearer mirrour in which may trulier be
diſcerned the malice or gratitude of men towards the gods,
and conſequently of their puniſhment and pity towards
men, then in the alterations of the Seaſons; which, the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
writers the better to ſignifie unto us, made the Hours
the Porters to heaven gates, and gave them power over the
clouds, both in the muſtering of them, or diſperſing them.
And ſo much for the Houres.</p>

the earth, and all the inhabitants thereof; for there
is no benefit either of pleaſure or profit that can accrue to
us, which flowes not from their immediate grace and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.

Chariot, to anſwer and correſpond to the livery which the
Sun gives, his being all of the like colour. For the ſwiftneſſe

white ſteeds upon her, derive not their hue from the gray
vapours that ariſe from the earth, but rather from the cleer
and perſpicuous ſplendour of the light it ſelfe. Thoſe that
of this fable would make a hiſtory, ſay that <hi>Tythonus</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
a wife out of the Eaſtern Countries, by whom he had
the forenamed children, and after lived to that age, that he

of thoſe Orientall climats, to be poſſeſt of which plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant

ſome fable that he was turned to a graſhopper, it ſignifies
nothing elſe but the loquacity of age, ambitiouſly groaning
in the often repetiton of things paſt, glorying in times of
old, and deſpiſing thoſe latter in reſpect of them; ſuch a one
did <hi>Homer</hi> perſonate in <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

arrowes are aim'd in this Fable, is to perſwade men by wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
patiently to undergo all the chances and changes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
to us, both in time and nature; ſince death by the
bounty of the gods is granted to man as a reſt and ceſſation
from all calamities and troubles. For when <hi>Aurora</hi> had
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:57230:90"/>
begged immortality for <hi>Tython.</hi> he feeling the infirmities
and defects of age, became himſelfe a ſupplyan to the gods,
That they would be to him ſo gracious, as to give him leave
to ſleep with his fathers, accounting it much better and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier

Now from the daughter to come back to the mother, and
know what is allegorically meant by Night. Theſe peſts

ſome of their violences by wiſedome be mitigated, though

As if the father were jealous of his daughters continence,
if by kiſſing her, he perceived ſhe had drunk wine. But
kiſſing and drinking both are now grown (it ſeems) to a

not ſpeak much of the worth of your ſex, ſince no man (I

of both which, though my promiſe bind me to ſpeak

we exactly conſider the end at which the vertue it ſelf doth
aime: for divers vertues have divers colours laid upon
them, according to the temperature of body, or the diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

another, yet both their endeavours intended to one Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude;
the Prudence of <hi>Neſtor</hi> unlike that of <hi>Vlyſſes,</hi> yet

therefore preferring the ſafety of his wife before his owne

the female let goe, beholding with his own eies, his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant

it was diſputed, whether <hi>Cornelia</hi> were more happy in
enjoying ſuch a husband, or made more wretched in lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing

the laſt, her hiſtory I thus receive in briefe. <hi>Admetus</hi> a King
of Greece,<note place="margin">Alceſte.</note> demanded <hi>Alceſte</hi> in marriage, whoſe father had
publiſhed an Edict, That none ſhould enjoy her ſave ſuch
a one as could reconcile two wild beaſts of contrary cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties
and natures oppoſite, to draw without jarring toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in his Chariot. This <hi>Admetus</hi> hearing, he petitioned to
<hi>Apollo</hi> and <hi>Hercules,</hi> who commiſerating his ſuit, the one
brought him a Lion, the other a Beare, both made tame and
gentle to his hand; who preſenting them to the father of
<hi>Alceſte,</hi> and having yoaked them and made them draw ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Edict, received her as his bride, and depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with her thence into his own Country of Theſſaly. Not
long after <hi>Admetus</hi> falling into a great infirmity of ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and conſulting with the Oracle about his health, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
was returned, That he muſt neceſſarily leave the
world, unleſſe he could procure ſome Friend, Kinſman,
Courtier, or other, who by ſacrificing their own lives to his
love, might ranſome his, and by no other means his health
to be reſtored. This motion being made to many both neer
and deer to him (who no doubt had promiſed more, with
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:57230:96"/>
purpoſe to perform leſſe) in concluſion it was refuſed by
all; which comming to the eare of <hi>Alceſte,</hi> ſhe gave her
ſelfe up to a moſt willing death, to redeem the health and
life of her husband; and with her own hands ſlew her ſelf.
Now tell me (O you Satyriſts againſt the ſex of women,
that call them fraile, inconſtant, weak and timorous) in
which of theſe two did manly courage, noble reſolution, or
conjugall love moſt ſhine? in him that by ſuffering death
to ſteal upon him, yielded himſelfe to the neceſſity of fate,
or in her who like a bold Virago with an unmarchable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution,
with her own hand extracted that blood from her
chaſt breſt, with which ſhe writ her ſelfe a character of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
to outlaſt all antiquity? In theſe things then you
ſee, they may juſtly claim an equall competence with men,
but in many things a juſt priority, as in nurſing and brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
up children, in mannaging the affairs of the houſe,
and care of all domeſtick buſineſſe, in providing us Diet,
Linnen for the back and bed, in ſewing, weaving, and in
ſpinning: for who cannot imagine how ill great <hi>Hercules</hi>
did become the diſtaffe? But I will ceaſe further to ſpeak
in their praiſe, leſt I be taxed of palpable flattery, and ſome
may lay on me an aſperſion, That either I lov'd that ſex
wondrous well in my youth, or perhaps now begin to doat
on them in my age. And ſince I laſt ſpake of that conjoined

after dinner the King being ready to take horſe, and bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

ſlew <hi>Menalippus</hi> the Prieſt of <hi>Apollo,</hi> and aſſumed to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
the ſacred office and dignity. In the number of theſe
noble Citizens, he cauſed <hi>Phedimus</hi> the wife of <hi>Aretaphila,</hi> to
be injuriouſly put to death, and married her againſt her
will: who as well diſtreſt with her private diſcontents, as
ſuffering in the publique calamity, meditated a remedy for
both, and by adviſe of ſome of her neereſt allies, attempted
to poiſon the King; but the project being diſcovered, was
prevented: and upon that ground <hi>Calbia</hi> mother to <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi>

by which the City received her priſtine liberty and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
For which the people would have done her divine

the City Miletum, where they before inhabited, and were
driven to plant a new Colony in Manus, betwixt which Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
there was a perpetuall jar and enmity; inſomuch, that
from a private quarrell, it grew to a publike war, yet nor
in that violence, but that upon certain feſtivall daies, there
was free recourſe betwixt the Citizens of the one and the
other, to be preſent at the ſacred ſolemnities. There was
amongſt theſe of the City of Minus, one of a Noble family,
whoſe name was <hi>Pythes,</hi> his wife was called <hi>Japigia,</hi> and his

curteſie ſoever the City or his power could yeeld, and it
ſhould be inſtantly granted; to which he anſwered. That
nothing could be more acceptable unto her, then that the

more then a ceſſation of arms, and that peace might be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
betwixt the two Cities: which by their marriage
was accordingly effected, and <hi>Pyeria</hi> ever after honoured
for the motion. Inſomuch that it grew to a Proverb, All

the Mileſian women deſiring to be no better beloved of

                  <p>
                     <hi>Aſpaſia</hi> being the daughter of <hi>Hermotimus Phocencis</hi> (her
mother dying of her in childbirth) was by her fathers care
brought up,<note place="margin">Aſpaſia:</note> though meanly, yet modeſtly: and growing
towards underſtanding, ſhe had many dreams as preſages
of her future fortunes; namely, that ſucceeding times
ſhould afford her a husband, faire, good and rich. In this
interim ſhe was troubled with an unſeemly ſwelling of the
chin, ſo great, that it grew almoſt to a deformity, being a
ſorrow to the father, and almoſt a heart-break to the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
<hi>Hermotimus</hi> carefull of her health, preſents her malady
to the Phyſitian; who was willing to undertake the patient,
but withall propoſed too great a ſumme for the cure: the
one replying, The demand is above my ſtrength; the other
anſwered, Then is the cure above my skill, and ſo departed.
This diſcouragement from a Tumour without, grew to a
Corraſive within; as much tormented with the deſpair of her
recoveries, as the violence of the diſeaſe. In this anxiety of
thoughts, and agony of paine being much perplexed, ſhe
gave her ſelfe to all abſtinence, and forbare to eat; till on
a time gentle ſlumber ſtealing upon her, there appeared to
her a Turtle, which was inſtantly tranſhapt into a woman
moſt beautifull, who drawing more neer, bids her take cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
and be of comfort, and forgetting the Phyſitians with
all their drugs, unguents, and emplaſters, only to apply to
the place then grieved, Roſe leaves dried to powder,
and not to doubt of her preſent recovery; and having thus
ſaid, upon the inſtant vaniſht. <hi>Aſpaſia</hi> awaking, and by this
viſion much comforted, applied to her face ſuch things as
ſhe was taught; in ſhort time all ſwelling was taken away,
and ſhe reſtored to her priſtine beauty, with ſuch an addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of comelineſſe, that thoſe with whom ſhe before was
held but equall, ſhe in the eies of all men might now claim
over them a juſt precedence: for ſhe is thus deſcribed,
Her hair ſomewhat yellow, and from her temples naturally
curling, her eies big and clear, her noſe ſomewhat (but moſt
becommingly) hooked, her ears ſhort, her skin white and
ſoft, her cheeks ſeeming to lodge the ſweet bluſhes of the
Roſe (for which cauſe the Phocenſes call'd her from an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant,
<hi>Milto)</hi> her lips red, her teeth then ſnow more white,
her feet without all fault, her voice ſo ſweet and raviſhing,
that when ſhe ſpake, ſhe would put you in mind of what you
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:57230:104"/>
have read of the Syrens. From all effeminate curioſities, ſhe
ſtudied to alienate her ſelfe, theſe being commonly the
ſuperfluities of wealth and abundance, ſhe being but of
humble fortunes, and deſcended from me in parentage. It
hapned this <hi>Aſpaſia</hi> was by a Perſian ſouldier taken from
her father (as all their Cities in thoſe daies were ſubject to
the like oppreſſions) and preſented unto <hi>Cyrus</hi> the ſon of
<hi>Darius</hi> and <hi>Paraſatides,</hi> but much againſt her own will, or
the liking of her father: thus preſented to him in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany

the civility of her carriage, and an irreprovable
beauty without all ſtame or blemiſh; and that which
heightned the love of all men towards her, ſhe was of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
wiſedome: for which <hi>Cyrus</hi> afterward often admitted
her into his counſels, and ſo oft as he was ſwar'd by her ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe,

onely thou haſt brought me chaſt and uncorrupted,
the reſt both in beauty and behaviour are impoſtures: and
from thenceforth ſhe was ſollicited and beloved of the King
above all others, with whom he had before or after converſt
with, and from that time a mutuall affection grew betwixt
them, ſo great that it increaſed as far as the modeſt and
abſolute confirmation of marriage, conformable to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome
of the Graecians. Inſomuch that the love of the King
to <hi>Aſpaſia</hi> was not rumoured in Ionia ſolely, but through all
the ſpacious Provinces of Greece, even Peloponneſus was
filled with the bruit thereof, to the glory of the great King;
who after his familiar acquaintance with her, was never
known to have uſed the company of any other woman. And
now began the viſion of <hi>Aſpaſia</hi> (concerning the Dove) to
be much ſpoken of, and of the goddeſſe that appeared to her,
to whom ſhe dedicated (after) a goodly ſtatue, called the
image of <hi>Venus,</hi> beautified with many rich jewels; withall,
the picture of a Dove, to which ſhe made daily ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
ſacrifices, and oblations, ſtill imploring the favour of
the goddeſſe. To her father <hi>Hermotimus</hi> ſhe ſent many rich
and unvalued preſents, making him of a ſubject, almoſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paralleld
for wealth, uſing in the proceſſe of her life (as wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
as well the Perſian as Graecian Ladies) a wonderous
modeſty and continence. <hi>Hormus,</hi> ſometimes of Theſſaly,
was ſent from <hi>Scopa</hi> the junior, who was of Sicily, with an
admirable rich jewell to <hi>Cyrus</hi> for a preſent. Who having
ſhewed it to many, all wondering at the coſt and workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
and proud of ſo rich a gem: preſently after dinner,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:57230:105"/>
repaired to the chamber of <hi>Aſpaſia,</hi> and finding her aſleep,
caſt himſelfe upon the bed by her without diſturbing her
reſt: who waking and eſpying the King ſo neer, began to
imbrace him according to her accuſtomed manner, who
preſently taking the jewel from the casker, ſhewed it to
her, uſing theſe words, This I beſtow on thee as a gift wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
the daughter or mother of an Emperor, which I charge
thee to wear for my ſake in a carkanet about thy neck. To
whom ſhe wiſely and conſiderately anſwered, And how
dare I be the poſſeſſor of ſo great a treaſure, which rather
becomes the majeſty and eſtate of your mother <hi>Paraſatides?</hi>
therefore I intreat you ſend it to her, for I without this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament,
can preſent you with a neck ſufficiently beautiful.
The King much pleaſed with her anſwer, daily and hourly
more and more increaſed his love towards her, and what
ſhe ſaid and did, ſent in a letter to his mother, with the
jewell incloſed. For which ſhe was not only much graced
and favoured by the Princeſſe, but after by <hi>Cyrus</hi> rewarded
with mony rich gifts, of value ineſtimable, all which ſhe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly
ſent back with this meſſage; Theſe things, O King,
may be uſefull to thee that haſt the charge of ſuch infinites
of men, when my greateſt riches is to be ſolely beloved of
thee: with theſe and the like, ſhe tied the King in inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
bonds of affections towards her. For without all compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titorſhip,
in the beauty of face, feature of body, integrity of
life, and nobleneſſe of mind, ſhe was above all thoſe of her
time admirable. But after <hi>Cyrus</hi> being ſlain in battell by his
brother, and his whole army overthrown, ſhe likewiſe fell
into the hands of the enemy: whom the King <hi>Artaxerxes</hi>
with ſingular care and diligence cauſed to be ſought, and
brought before him, as one whoſe name and vertues he held
in great reſpect and eſtimation; and being preſented before
him bound, he grew wondrous angry, commanding all ſuch
to priſon, as were the authors of her leaſt durance: withall
commanding a coſtly and magnificent robe to be caſt about
her, which ſhe with many tears and much ſorrow refuſed,
till ſhe was compell'd to it by the King, ſtill taking to heart
and lamenting the death of <hi>Cyrus.</hi> But thus adorned, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Perſian ſtate, ſhe appeared in the eies of all
men the faireſt of women, eſpecially in the Kings, much
ſurpriſed with her extraordinary beauty, ſtill perſwading
her to raze out the memory of <hi>Cyrus</hi> dead, and in his room
to admit of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> living; which ſlowly, and at length
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:57230:105"/>
though late, he obtained, reſpecting her above all other his
wives and concubines. Soon after, his Eunuch <hi>Toridates,</hi>
died, more then a child, and ſcarce full man, the moſt beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
youth in Aſia, and of the King the moſt beloved;
who ſo much lamented his death, that all the pricipalities
and nations under him, ſeemed to participate of his griefe;
yet none that durſt be ſo bold as to come into his preſence,
or miniſter to him any words of comfort. Three daies being
paſt in theſe lamentations and ſorrowes, <hi>Aſpaſia</hi> in a fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
habit, and with her eies fixt upon the earth, appeared
before the King; who no ſooner eſpied her, demanded the
cauſe of her comming: To comfort thee (ſaid ſhe) O King,
if thou beeſt ſo pleaſed, elſe to return to the place of ſorrow
from whence I came. At which ſeeming to rejoice, the King
intreated her to her chamber whither he would preſently
repaire, to whom ſhe obeied. And having put on a robe of
the Eunuchs, ſo much bewailed, and in that caſting her ſelfe
upon her bed, ſhe gave the King ſuch content, that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
her till the daies of mourning were paſt, never
to appear to him but in that habit; ſhe more prevailing with
him then all his Princes, wives, ſubjects, and ſervants about
him, ſtil living in his moſt eſpeciall grace and favour. And

The Tyrant being gone, the young men in the way
of jeſting and ſport, and ſeeming a little to touch her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſtity,
demanded the reaſon, why to all other men her face
was bare and free, only to him vailed? (intimating that
ſomething had paſt betwixt them, which might diſcover her
bluſhes) to whom ſhe made this plain and ſerious anſwer,
<hi>I did it to him as an honour, becauſe amongſt all the Cumani,
there is but one only man, and that is Ariſtodemus.</hi> Theſe words
touching all to the quick, it impreſt in the minds of the
more generous, a true feeling of their baſeneſſe and ſlave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
with a ſhame thereof, and withall an apprehenſion of
the recovery of their priſtine liberties: which perceiving,
ſhe thus proceeded, <hi>I had rather to purchaſe my fathers repeale
from exile, to play the labourer, and bear burdens as you do; then
live the Tyrant in all the ſurfetting riots and delicacies on the
earth:</hi> and ſo left them, Theſe laſt words gave confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to what they had before ſcarce apprehended; which
after brought the embryons of their thoughts unto a timely
and full-born action: For with the Prince <hi>Timotoles,</hi> they
conſpired againſt <hi>Ariſtodemus,</hi> and <hi>Zenocrita</hi> had made their
entrance free, at ſuch time as he was ſecure, and his guard
negligent, when with great eaſe and ſmall danger, they
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:57230:110"/>
ruſht upon him and flew him. Thus by her means her
Country recovered their ancient liberties and honours.
But when great and magnificent gifts were preſented her
for this good ſervice, ſhe refuſed them all, only making one
requeſt unto the people, That it might be lawfull for her to
take the body of <hi>Ariſtodemus,</hi> and give it a ſolemn and roi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
buriall: to which they did not only with great willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
condeſcend, but they inſtituted her the Prieſt of <hi>Ceres,</hi>
ſuppoſing it to be an honour no leſſe acceptable to the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe,
then worthily becoming her.</p>

you have provided for your ſelfe and your ſubjects plenty, but
of other viands no plenty at all; we have ſtore of artificiall, but
the uſe of naturall things hath utterly forſaken us: no man tils,

people, and the reſt were imploied in agriculture and til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage,
planting, and ſuch things moſt uſefull for mans ſuſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.
This <hi>Pythes</hi> after many diſaſters (as rich men are
ſeldome without ſome or other) as the death of his children,
who all came to violent and unexpected death, by the
means of <hi>Xerxes;</hi> he fell into a wondrous deep melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
for he hated life, and yet was loath to die, and like a foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
rich man (as this age affords many) griefe ſtil would
have killed him, had not the thought of his wealth ſtill
recovered him; therefore he propoſed this farewell, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt

There was in the City a great heap of gold, by which a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

the ſole government of the State and Empire to his

his Tomb, but daily ſend him ſuch a quanty of victuals in a
boat by the river; and when they found the meat untoucht,
to forbeare to ſend any more, for they ſhould then imagine
him dead. And ſuch was the covetous mans end in the

with great wiſedome and policy, and to the generall good

pleaſed to allot them of their land, and ſuffer them peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
to dwell amongſt them: But finding them in a ſhort
ſpace to increaſe both in wealth and power, they conſulted
amongſt themſelves by what means to deſtroy them, and
utterly extirp their memory: this stratagem was agreed
upon to be performed at a banquet. It hapned that one of
the Carian damoſels call'd <hi>Caphaena,</hi> a Lady of a noble fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
grew much enamoured of this <hi>Nymphaeus,</hi> and loath
that the leaſt detriment ſhould happen to her beſt reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
friend, eſpecially loath to ſee him periſh, ſhe opened
to him the full purpoſe of the City, wiſhing him to uſe all
means of prevention. When therefore the Cryaſſences
came to invite them to the feaſt, <hi>Nymphaeus</hi> anſwered them,
that it was not the cuſtome of the Graecians to aſſemble un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
any ſuch feaſts, without the company of their women:
which the Carians hearing, intreated them likewiſe to grace
the ſolemnity with their preſence. This done, <hi>Nymphaeus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
the whole circumſtance to the Melians his countri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
intreating them to beare him company to the feaſt all
civilly habited, and without weapons, only that every wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
ſhould weare a ſword beneath her kirtle, and ſit cloſe
by her husband. About the midſt of the banquet when the
Carians were ready to give the watchword, the Graecians
perceiving that the inſtant (for the pretended execution)
drew on, all the women opening their garments at once,
ſhewed their concealed weapons, which their husbands
ſnatching from their ſides, aſſaulted the barbarous Carians,
and ſlew them all to one man: by which prevention, they
poſſeſt themſelves both of the Countrie and City. But re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſhing
that, they built another which they called the
new Cryaſſa, and in which they planted themſelves. <hi>Caphae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>
was married to <hi>Nymphaeus,</hi> having honours done to her,
worthy her noble fidelity. One thing in this hiſtory is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy

they came to their better ſences. The Amphiſſeſian ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons,

as the City yielded, and ſent them (though the
wives of their enemies) in the charge and ſafe conduct of
their own husbands, peaceably home to their own Cities.
Comparable to their modeſty, was the magnanimity of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſto,</hi>
an eminent Ladie of the City Elis. <hi>Ariſtotemus</hi> the
Tyrant, having (by the power of <hi>Antigonus)</hi> uſurped the
Franchiſes and Liberties of that City, oppreſſed the people
with infinite calamities; amongſt which, that of <hi>Philodemus</hi>
was not the leaſt, who having a beautifull daughter called
<hi>Micca,</hi> when <hi>Lucinus</hi> one of the Captains of <hi>Ariſtotemus,</hi> in
the heat of wine and luſt, would forceably have raviſht her,
and the poor innocent virgin fled for refuge into the arms
of her father, he there moſt inhumanely tranſpierced her,
mixing the teares of the revend old man, with the blood of
his daughter. The horridneſſe of this nothing moved the
Tyrant, but (that if greater poſſibly could be deviſed) he
gave countenance even to ſuch miſchiefs, cauſing many of
the prime Citizens to be ſlaine, and to the number of eight
hundred baniſhed. But fearing in regard of their number,
he might be in time ſubverted; he made Proclamation,
That all ſuch women that had a deſire to viſit their abſent
husbands, ſhould with ſuch gold and treaſure as they could
conveniently carry (with their children) have peaceable
paſſage from the City into Aetolia, where many or the moſt
of their exiled friends then ſojourned. Many of the women
encouraged by this Edict, being to that purpoſe aſſembled,
and with ſuch goods as they had, departed the City; he ſent
after them his horſemen, who not only rifled them, but
ſtampt their children beneath their horſes feet, where many
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:57230:118"/>
of the infants periſhed, and ſo in confuſed heaps hurried
them back into the Town, bearing the ſpoile into the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants
treaſury. Theſe outrages were the leaſt of many
which I purpoſely omit. There lived at that time an anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Noble man in the City, called <hi>Hellanicus,</hi> who entered
into a combination with the exiles, about the ſuppreſſing of
the Tyrant, and by reaſon of his years, was neither by him
feared nor ſuſpected: by the encouragement of this <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanicus,</hi>
the confined Citizens aſſembled themſelves into a
City moſt convenient for their deſign, called Amimona, to
whom many of their allies and friends (copartners in the
publique calamity) reſorted. <hi>Ariſtotemus</hi> ſomewhat affrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with this new faction, repaired to a place of publick aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly,
whither he had cauſed all the chiefe matrons to be
before called, and there in a premeditated oration, ſtuft
with many threats and menaces, proteſted to inflict upon
them racks, tortures, and lingring deaths, unleſſe by ſpeedy
letters they did not only perſwade but prevaile with their

fortified. To whom <hi>Megiſto</hi> the wife of <hi>Tymoleon</hi> (a Lady
amongſt the reſt moſt reſpected, not daigning the Tyrant
the leaſt honour, or ſo much as riſing to do him reverence,
but ſitting) with a bold and undanted courage, thus ſpake.
<q>Wert thou a true ſpirited man, as nothing leſs appears in
thee, thou wouldſt not threaten women in this baſe kind
to betray their husbands, but wouldeſt rather have nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated
with them, who have entire power and command
over us, and that in ſmoother and more deceitfull lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
then ſuch by which thou haſt hitherto beguiled
us. But if thy cowardiſe and deſperation compell thee
to this exigent, as thinking by our means to complot
their ruines, thou art in that hope deſtitute of all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfort:
let that day never be callendred, to memoriſe
them among men ſo void of counſell and diſcretion, that
by ſparing the lives of their wives and children, they
ſhould betray the ſacred liberty of their countrie: for the
miſchiefe is not ſo great to loſe us altogether, whom they
have already wanted ſo long, as the good and profit that
muſt neceſsarily accrue by redeeming the Cities from
thy inſolency and tyranny.</q> Theſe words were no ſooner
uttered, but <hi>Ariſtotemus</hi> diſtracted with rage and fury, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
her young ſon to be ſought and brought, whom he
purpoſed to maſsacre before the mothers face: and whilſt

his lictors and ſerjeants were inquiring for him amongſt
others that were then buſied about their childiſh ſports,
ſhe ſpying him, of her own accord called him to her with
theſe words, Come hither to me, O my ſon, and now in thy
childhood before thou haſt apprehenſion, or paſſionate fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of tyrannie, be freed both from the terror and burden
thereof; or mine own part, I had rather ſee thee innocently
dying, then baſely and ignobly ſerving. The Tyrant at
her laſt ſpeech more inraged then the former, drew out his
ſword on purpoſe to have ſlain her, when <hi>Cylo</hi> one of his
familiar friends (but indeed a chiefe man in the confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racie
with <hi>Hellanicus)</hi> ſtaid his hand, and by gentle words
ſo tempered his ſpleen, that he departed thence without any
act of murder, yet purpoſe of a future revenge. Upon a day
as he was ſporting upon the bed with his wife untill din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
was prepared and diſpoſed upon the table, it hapned
that an Eagle ſoaring above the Palace, let fall a great
ſtone upon the battlements, juſt over the bed where the
King then lay, and alighting there, made ſuch a fearfull
and prodigious noiſe, that it not only amaſed the King
within, but was wonderfull to all that beheld it without.
The Augurers were ſent for, to know what omen ſhould
ſucceed: they flatter the Tyrant, and promiſe nothing but
what is good and proſperous. <hi>Hellanicus</hi> the ſame night in
his dream imagined his ſon appeared to him (which ſon was
by <hi>Ariſtotemus</hi> before murdered with his brother) who
ſpoke to him to this effect, <hi>O father ariſe, is this a time to ſleep,
when the whole government of the City muſt depend on you to
morrow?</hi> with this dream incouraged, he comforted his
adherents, all attending the opportunity of revenge. <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotemus</hi>

meeting by chance, and almoſt extaſied to ſee him ſo weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

ſeated in the middeſt of our Countrie, and centre of

out of their houſes with joy and clamour, embracing their
husbands, fathers, and friends, with loud and glad accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations;
thence in multitudes they made concourſe to the
Pallace. The Tyrants wife to prevent their fury, made faſt
her dore, and in her private chamber ſtrangled her ſelfe.
<hi>Ariſtotemus</hi> had two beautifull young virgins to his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
both marriageable, theſe they were about to drag in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

could appeare more terrible to her, then to behold her die; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
beſought her, by the affinity of ſiſterhood, to be the firſt that

In <hi>Megiſto</hi> is expreſt the Magnanimity of ſpirit, but in

There was a Noble man of England created Earle of

and priviledges, inſomuch, that by his oppreſſions,
and inſufferable exactions, the City was much decaied, the
people diſabled in their power, and weakned in their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes:
<note place="margin">A Lady of Coventry.</note> Theſe petitioned to the Counteſſe, a Noble and
well diſpoſed Lady, to mediate for them to the Earle, That
their cuſtomes and former liberties might be reſtored. The
Lady undertakes their ſuit, and with much importunity ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited
her Lord in their behalfe; but he being of a
haughty and inſolent diſpoſition ſtill perſiſted immovable;
but ſhe commiſerating their eſtate, as daily moved with
their complaints, without ceſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>tion ſtill ſollicited for them,
and with ſuch urgence, that he had neither peace at board,
nor quiet in bed; he at length as much wearied with her
importunity, as ſhe tired with their petitions, ſhe wreſted
from him this churliſh and indefinite anſwer, <hi>Ceaſe Lady,
further to perſwade me, for I proteſt, and that with an unaltered
reſolution, that there is but one only means by which their fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſes
are to be recovered, which if thou wilt undertake (as I
preſume thou wilt not) I will ſurrender them up intirely, if not,
I will continue them in the ſame eſtate that I now hold them.</hi>
The Lady gently demanding what impoſition he would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join
her, he thus replied, <hi>Thou ſhalt ſtrip thy ſelfe ſtark naked,
and mounted on horſeback, at mid-day ride in that manner
through the City, from one gate to another, and by this exploit on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
their deſire and thy ſuit is to be granted.</hi> The modeſt Lady
after ſome little pauſe, promiſed her Lord, that for their
generall good ſhe would doe it. This being ſealed by an
oath from him, and a vow from her, ſhe acquainted the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens
with her purpoſe, and appointed a day in which ſhe
commanded them to lock all their doors, and ſhut in their
windowes, and not to leave any ſmall cranny open towards
the ſtreet, nor ſuffer any living thing to be abroad: This
being faithfully and punctually performed by them, ſhe as
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:57230:124"/>
effectually accompliſhed her promiſe, and rid in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
with no more touch of immodeſtie, then when ſhe ſhif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
her ſmock in her private chamber. Some may ſay, Yet
what might the people apprehend in their conceits, to think

he can endure by no means. Inſomuch, that the poor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill,

into an Ordinary, where a C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

denying, the Gallant told him, A Cuckold he found him,
and ſo would leave him, and with that language he bad

diſcovering himſelfe, appears unto him in a rough black

The man at theſe words amazed, began to ſtruggle with the
devill, who laid violent hands upon him. It hapned, that
neer to this wreſtling place, a poor labouring man was
digging of gravell, there lay by the edge of the pit a luſty
maſtiffe (that had been a Bear-dog) to keep the poor mans
hat and jerkin, whilſt he was at work below: this dog ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

thinks to put a new trick upon his adverſary; for he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
that (ten to one) he will come back again for his bag,
therefore he intreats the poor man to help him to put the

ſtrings. All is done, and they retire themſelves apart, when

caſting his eies timerouſly about him, as fearing the like
aſſault, he came ſoftly treading to the place where he left
his ſack, and gently feeling finds ſomewhat to ſtir therein:
upon which he preſently imagines that it was the ſuppoſed
Cuckold, who for fear had crept into the ſame; and being
wondrous jocund with this conceit, ſnatcheth him up upon
his back, and with his glad purchaſe ſinks himſelfe down a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong

Synod called, in which <hi>Lucifer</hi> ſeated himſelfe in his wonted
ſtate with all his Princes, Judges and Officers about him,
all in great expectation of the object ſo much deſired: the
meſſenger is ſummon'd, who appears before them with his
bag at his back, or rather upon his neck; he is commanded
to diſcover his ſtrange creature ſo often ſpoken of, but till
then in that place not ſeen; the ſacks mouth is opened, out
flies the maſtiffe amongſt them, who ſeeing ſo many ugly
creatures together, thought (it ſeems) he had been amongſt
the Bears in Paris garden: but ſpying <hi>Lucifer</hi> to be the

rude Nation, to her admiration and love, as the Adamant
drawes iron. <hi>Plutarch in libro Amator.</hi> ſaith, ſhe was a damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell

with whoſe love <hi>Ninus</hi> being after beſotted, took her to his
wife; of whom ſhe had that predominance, that though

his neighbour Kings, and ſubdued <hi>Zoroaſtres</hi> Monarch of

far prevailed with him, that for one day ſhe might ſit in the
roiall throne, and for that ſpace have the regall juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

Empire. In the morning of her ſoveraignty, ſhe impoſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the ſubjects ſuch modeſt and mild injunctions, that ere
noon ſhe had inſinuated into their boſomes ſo far, that ſhe
found them ſo pliable and conformable to her deſires, that
ſhe preſumed there was nothing ſo difficult and impoſſible,
which for her ſake they would not boldly and reſolutely
undertake. Upon this preſumption, ſhe ſtretched her uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
ſo far, that ſhe commanded them to lay hands upon
the King her husband before night, and committing him
to priſon, cauſed him within few daies to be put to death.
She had by <hi>Ninus</hi> one ſon, called <hi>Ninus</hi> junior, who ſhould
have ſucceeded his father, that for fifty two years ſpace, had
ſwaied the Babylonian Empire: but whether in her own

which the Poets have reported of her, I ſhal not impertinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
place her next to <hi>Semiramis Apollodorus Grammaticus</hi> in
his book, <hi>de Deorum origine</hi> (as <hi>Benedictus Aeginus Spoletinus</hi>

Creet, eſpouſed <hi>Paſiphae,</hi> daughter of the Sun and <hi>Perſeis,</hi>
or (as <hi>Aſclepiades</hi> cals her) <hi>Creta,</hi> the daughter of <hi>Aterius,</hi>
ſhe had by him foure ſons, <hi>Cretaeus, Deucalion, Glaucus</hi> and
<hi>Androgeus,</hi> and as many daughters, <hi>Hecate, Xenodice, Ariadne,</hi>
and <hi>Phaedra.</hi> This <hi>Minos</hi> peaceably to enjoy his Kingdome,
had promiſed to offer ſuch a bull to <hi>Neptune;</hi> but having
obtained his deſires, he ſent that Bull before markt out,
back to the herd, and cauſed another of leſſe value to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed:
at which <hi>Neptune</hi> inraged, knew not with what
greater puniſhment to afflict him for the breach of his
faith, then to make his wife moſt prepoſterouſly and againſt
nature, to dote on that beaſt which he had ſo carefully pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.
She therefore confederated with <hi>Dedalus,</hi> a great
Artsmaſter (one that for murder had fled from Athens,
and with his ſon <hi>Icarus</hi> there ſecured himſelfe) he deviſed by
his miſchievous skill, a woodden Cow, hollowed within with
ſuch artificiall conveyance, that the Queen encloſed, had
ſatisfaction of her deſires, to the glutting of her libidinous
appetite. Of this congreſſion ſhe conceived and brought
forth a ſon called <hi>Aſterion,</hi> or (as the moſt will have it) <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notaurus,</hi>
ſhaped with a buls head and a mans body. About
this monſtrous iſſue, <hi>Minos</hi> conſulted with the Oracle;
which adviſed him to ſhut him in a Labyrinth, and there ſee
him ſafely brought up and kept. This Labyrinth (the firſt
that ever was) was built by <hi>Dedalus,</hi> being a houſe ſo intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
with windings and turnings, this way and that way,
now forward, then backward, that it was ſcarce poſſible for
any that entred therein,<note place="margin">Lib. 1.</note> to find the direct way back; thus
far <hi>Apollodorus:</hi> But <hi>Palephatus</hi> in his fabulous Narrations,
reduceth all theſe commented circumſtances within the

concerning <hi>Paſiphae. Minos</hi> being afflicted with a diſeaſe in
his ſecret parts, with which he had been long grieved, was
at length by <hi>Crides,</hi> who belonged to <hi>Pandion,</hi> cured. In the
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:57230:132"/>
interim of this his defect and weakneſſe, the Queen caſt an
adulterate eie upon a fair young man called <hi>Taurus,</hi> whom
<hi>(Servius</hi> ſaith) was the ſcribe or ſecretary to the King; ſhe
proſtituting her ſelfe to his embraces, when the full time
was expired ſhe produced her iſſue: which <hi>Minos</hi> ſeeing,
and taking a true ſupputation of the time, comparing the
birth with his diſcontinuance from her bed (by reaſon of
his diſeaſe) apprehended the adultery; notwithſtanding he
was unwilling to kill the baſtard, becauſe it had a reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
to the reſt of his children, though an impreſſion of
the fathers face, by which the adulterer might eaſily be
known. <hi>Minos</hi> therefore to conceal his own diſcontents, and
as much as in him lay, to hide his wives ſhame, whom no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearedly
affected, cauſed the infant to be carried into a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
mountain, and there by the Kings herds men to be
foſtered. But growing towards manhood, he likewiſe grew
intractable and diſobedient to thoſe whoſe charge he was
committed. The King therefore confin'd him into a deep
cave digg'd in a rock of purpoſe, not to curb his fierce and
cruell diſpoſition, but rather encourage it; for whoſoever
at any time he feared, or whatſoever he was that had offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
him, he ſent him to this <hi>Minotaur,</hi> on ſome impertinent
or other, by whom he was cruelly butchered. The cave was
called Labyrinthus, and therefore deſcribed with ſo many
intricate blind Meanders, in regard of the difficulty of his
return with life, who was ſeen to enter there. Therefore
when <hi>Theſeus</hi> came to <hi>Minos,</hi> he ſent him to be devoured by

               <p>THeſe might ſeem fearfull enough before related, but I
will give you a ſhort taſte of ſome more abominable:
I have ſhewed the examples of Luſt, but theſe following are
beſides luſt, polluted with unheard of Tyranny. <hi>Herodotus</hi> in
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:57230:134"/>
his third book ſpeaking at large of the life and acts of
<hi>Cambyſes</hi> the great Perſian King, and ſon of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> relates,
that having ſhewed his puiſſance abroad in Egypt, Greece,
and other places, to the terror of the greateſt of the world:
he cauſed his innocent brother <hi>Smerdis,</hi> to be ſecretly made
away by the hand of his moſt truſted <hi>Praxaſpes.</hi> The next
inhumanity which he purpoſed to exemplifie unto the
world, was the death of his ſiſter, who followed him in his
Camp to Egypt, and back again: being not only his ſiſter
by parents, but his wife alſo. The manner how ſhe came to
be his Queen, was as followeth; Before his time it was not
lawfull, but puniſhable amongſt the Perſians, to marry
into that proximity of blood: but <hi>Cambyſes</hi> ſurprized with
the love of his ſiſter, and having reſolved by what means ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
to make her his wife, yet to colour his purpoſe, he ſent
for thoſe honourable perſons who were ſtiled the Kings
Judges, being ſelected men for their wiſedomes, and of
great place and quality, as thoſe that enjoy their offices
<hi>Durante via,</hi> unleſſe ſome capitall crime be proved againſt
them; beſides, they are the expounders of the Lawes, and
to their cauſes all matters of doubt and controverſie are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred.
Theſe being convented, The King demanded of
them, Whether they had any one law amongſt ſo many,
which licenc'd a man (that had a will ſo to do) to contract
matrimony with his ſiſter? to whom the Judges thus inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niouſly
anſwered: <hi>We have indeed no Law which gives licence
for a brother to marry with a ſiſter, but we have found a Law
(O Soveraigne) which warrants the King of Perſia to do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
liketh him beſt.</hi> Thus they without abrogation of the
Perſian Laws, ſoothed the Kings humor, and preſerv'd their
own honours and lives, who had they croſt him in the leaſt
of his deſigns, had all undoubtedly periſhed: This he made
the ground for the marriage of the firſt, and not long after
he adventured upon the ſecond The younger of theſe two
who attended him into Egypt, he ſlew, whoſe death, as that
of her brother <hi>Smerdis,</hi> is doubtfully reported. The Graeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
write, that two whelps, the one of a Lion, the other of a

broke his chain, and taking his brothers part, they two had
ſuperiority over the Lyon. <hi>Cambyſes</hi> at this ſight taking
great delight, ſhe then ſitting next him, upon the ſudden

fell a weeping: this the King obſerving, demanded the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion

ſee one brother ſo willing to help the other, and therefore
ſhe wept to remember her brothers death, and knew no man
then living that was ready to revenge it; and for this
cauſe (ſay the Greeks) ſhe was doom'd to death by <hi>Camby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</hi>
The Egyptians report it another way; That ſhe ſitting
with her brother at table, out of a ſallet diſh took a lettice,
and pluckt off leafe by leafe, and ſhewing it to her husband,
asked him, Whether a whole lettice or one ſo deſpoiled,
ſhewed the better? who anſwered, a whole one: then (ſaid
ſhe) behold how this lettice now unleaved looketh, even
ſo haſt thou disfigured and made naked the houſe of King

could nor equall them, they thought to diſgrace him in
ſomething, and gave him the contemptible name of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
and baſtard: this made him curiouſly inquiſitive of
his ſuppoſed mother, and ſhe not able in that point to reſolve
him, he made a journy to Delphos, to conſult with the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
about the true knowledge of his birth and parents,
which forewarned him from returning into his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie,
becauſe he was deſtined not only to be the deaths-man
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:57230:135"/>
of his father, but to add miſery unto miſchiefe, he was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
born to be inceſtuous with his mother. Which to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent:
and ſtill ſuppoſing himſelfe to be the ſon of <hi>Polybus</hi>
and <hi>Peribaea,</hi> he forbore to return to Corinth, and hiring a
Chariot, took the way towards Phocis. It hapned that in a
ſtrait and narrow paſſage meeting with his father <hi>Laius,</hi>
and <hi>Polyphontes</hi> his Charioter, they contended for the way,
but neither willing to give place, from words they fell to
blowes: in which contention, <hi>Polyphontes</hi> kill'd one of the
horſes that drew the Chariot of <hi>Oedipus:</hi> at which inraged,
he drew his ſword, and firſt ſlew <hi>Polyphontes,</hi> and next <hi>Laius,</hi>
who ſeconded his ſervant, and thence took his ready way
towards Thebes. <hi>Damaſiſtratus</hi> King of the Plataeenſes, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the body of <hi>Laius,</hi> cauſed it to be honourably interred.
In this interim, <hi>Creon</hi> the ſon of <hi>Menecoeus</hi> in this vacancy,
whilſt there was yet no King, invades Thebes, and after
much ſlaughter, poſſeſſeth himſelfe of the Kingdome. <hi>Juno,</hi>

wings of a fowle, and the breaſt, feet and taile of a Lion:
ſhe having learned certaing problems and aenigmas of the

riddle that ſhe propoſed to the Thebans,<note place="margin">The riddle of <hi>Sphinx.</hi>
                  </note> was this, <hi>What
creature is that which hath one diſtinguiſhable voice, that firſt
walkes upon four, next two, and laſtly upon three feet, and the
more legs it hath, is the leſſe able to walk?</hi> The ſtrict condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of this monſter, were theſe, that ſo often as he deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the ſolution of this queſtion, till it was punctually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved,
he had power to chuſe out any of the people where
he beſt liked, whom he preſently devoured: but they had
this comfort from the Oracle, That this Aenigma ſhould be
no ſooner opened, and reconciled with truth, but they
ſhould be freed from this miſery, and the monſter himſelfe
ſhould be deſtroied. The laſt that was devoured, was <hi>Aemon</hi>
ſon to King <hi>Creon,</hi> who fearing leſt the like ſad fate might
extend it ſelfe to the reſt of his iſſue, cauſed proclamation
to be made, That whoſoever could expound this riddle,
ſhould marry <hi>Jocaſta</hi> the wife of the dead King <hi>Laius,</hi> and
be peaceably inveſted in the Kingdome: this no ſooner
came to the ears of <hi>Oedipus,</hi> but he undertook it, and reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
it thus: This creature (ſaith he) is man, who of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hath only a diſtinct voice, he is born four footed, as in
his infancy crawling upon his feet and hands, who growing
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:57230:136"/>
ſtronger, erects himſelfe, and walkes upon two only, but
growing decrepit and old, he is fitly ſaid to move upon
three, as uſing the help of his ſtaffe. This ſolution was no

fiſhermen, whom <hi>Homer</hi> asked what they had taken, but
they having got nothing that day, but for want of other

caſt away, but what they could not take they brought along.
Which riddle when <hi>Homer</hi> could not unfold, it is ſaid that
for very griefe he ended his life. This unmatchable Poet
whom no man regarded in his life, yet when his works

he adventured a third meſſage to <hi>Phaedima</hi> to this purpoſe:
It behooves you (O daughter) being deſcended from no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
anceſtors, to undergo any hazard, eſpecially at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
of your father, when it aims at the generall good of
the Common-weal or Kingdome; if that impoſtor be not
<hi>Smerdu</hi> the brother of <hi>Cambyſes</hi> (as I much feare) it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
him neither to proſtitute and defile your body, nor
to mock and abuſe the whole eſtate of Perſia unpuniſhed:
therefore I charged you as you tender my love, your owne
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:57230:145"/>
honour, and the Empires weale, that the next night when
you are called unto his bed, you watch the time when he
is ſoundlieſt aſleep, and then with your fingers gently feel
both the ſides of his head; if thou perceiveſt him to have
both his ears, preſume then thou lodgeſt by the ſide of <hi>Smer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi>
the ſon of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> but if on the contrary thou findeſt his
cors wanting, then thou lieſt in the boſome of <hi>Smerdis,</hi> that
baſe Magician. To this ſhe replied by letter, Though I tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
apprehend the danger, ſhould I be taken ſeeking of ſuch
things as he perhaps knowes wanting (which can be no leſs
then death) yet for your love and the common good,
I will undergo the perill: and with this briefe anſwer gave
ſatisfaction to her father. But greater content he received
from her, when having diſcovered and laid open whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever

remembers all the noble acts of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> with the dignity of
his blood and progeny: and paſſing over <hi>Cambyſes</hi> to come
to ſpeak of his brother <hi>Smerdis</hi> (contrary to the expectation
of the Magician) with teares began to commemorate the
death of the Prince, murdered and made away by his infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate

voiced into the ſacred Empire; namely, a groom, and one of
low and baſe deſcent, one that for cozenages and forgeries
had loſt his ears, a Magician, a Conjurer, one that had long
deluded them with his deviliſh ſorceries, a ſlave not worthy
at all to live, much leſſe to raign and govern ſo noble a
people: and as a further confirmation, that dying men
ſpeak true, theſe words were no ſooner ended, but he caſts
himſelfe off from the top of the Turret, and ſlew himſelfe.
After this, the Pallace was aſſaulted by the Princeſſe, the

that in the moſt fierce aſſaults, though her ſelf
danger of their croſſe-bows and ſlings, ſhe thought within the

that impatient of all delay, ſhe ſent unto her pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
enemy private meſſengers, That if it pleaſed the King
(being as ſhe underſtood a batchelor) to accept her as his
bride, ſhe would without further oppoſition, ſurrender up
the Town peaceably into his hands: theſe conditions are

twelve Huns, and thoſe of the baſeſt of his ſouldiers, one

nothing ſo much as her own libidinous delights, that ſhe
might the more freely and ſecurely injoy them, by many
ſundry treaſons conſpired the death of her husband: but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
made many attempts, and not prevailing in any, the
devill (to whom ſhe was a conſtant votareſſe) ſo far prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

til ſhe had not only diſpatcht him of life by poiſon, but
was the death alſo of a noble young Gentleman, the chiefe
favorite of the King, and one whom in all his deſigns he
moſt truſted. Theſe miſchiefs done, and fearing to be que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned
about them, becauſe ſhe had incurr'd a generall
ſuſpition, ſhe packt up her choiceſt jewels, and with a truſty
ſquire of hers, one that had been an agent in all her former
brothelries, fled into France, where by her counterfeit tears
and womaniſh diſſimulations, ſhe ſo far inſinuated into the
Kings breaſt, that the wrinckles of all ſuggeſtions were
cleared, and ſhe freely admitted into the Kings Court, and
by degrees into his eſpeciall favour: ſo rich were her jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els,
ſo gorgeous her attire, ſo tempting her beauty being
now in her prime, and withall ſo cunning and deceitfull her
behaviour; that all theſe agreeing together, not only ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the hearts of the Courtiers, but attracting the eies of
the great Majeſty it ſelfe, inſomuch, that the King ſporting
with her in a great Bay window, the Prince his ſonne then
ſtanding by him, he merrily demanded of her, If ſhe were
inſtantly to make election of a husband, whether ſhe would
chuſe him or his ſon? to whom ſhe raſhly anſwered, That
of the two ſhe would make choice of his ſon. The King at
this ſomewhat moved, and obſerving in her a lightneſſe of
behaviour, which his blind affection would not ſuffer him
before to look into, thus replied, <hi>Hadſt thou made election of
me, I had poſſeſt thee of my ſon, but in chuſing him, thou ſhalt
injoy neither.</hi> So turning from her, commanded her to be
ſtripped out of her jewels and gay ornaments, and preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to he ſhriven and ſent to a Monaſtery: where ſhe had
not long been cloiſtered, but to her own infamy, and the
diſgrace of the religious houſe, ſhe was deprehended in the
diſſolute imbraces of a wanton and lewd fellow, for which
ſhe was turned out of the cloiſter, and after died in great
poverty and miſery. In memory of whom there was a law
eſtabliſhed amongſt the Weſt Saxons, which diſabled all the
Kings wives after her, either to be dignified with the name
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:57230:149"/>
of Queen, or upon any occaſion to ſit with him on his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall

died (as it is ſaid) penitently, therefore methinks I hear her

whence this ſmoke grew; who, notwithſtanding many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations
of his own innocence, in which he derogated no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
from truth, was charged by his father (to avoid all
rumour and aſperſion) to forbear the occaſion and abſent
himſelfe from the houſe, and this he impoſed him upon his
bleſſing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> To this the young man with great modeſty aſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
as unwilling to contradict his fathers counſell, as to
encreaſe that injurious ſuſpition concerning the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>womans
honor, which was undeſervedly called in queſtion.
It is to be underſtood, that many friendly and modeſt cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſies
had paſt betwixt this young couple, inſomuch, that
having all liberty granted both of ſociety and diſcourſe,
he preſt her upon a time ſo far to know if it ſhould pleaſe
God to call away her husband (being very old and by the
courſe of nature not likely to live long) how ſhe purpoſed
to diſpoſe of her ſelfe. To whom ſhe proteſted, that though
ſhe wiſht her aged husband all along life and happineſs, yet
if it pleaſed the higher powers to lay the croſſe of widdow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
upon her, ſhe would, if he ſo pleaſed, confer upon him
her youth, her fortunes, and whatſoever ſhe was endowed
with, before any man living, if it pleaſed him to accept of
them, and this ſhe bound with an oath: This the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
(betwixt honouring and loving her) could not chuſe
but take wondrous kindly at her hands, and vowed to her
the like. The conditions on both ſides were accepted, only
as ſhe had bound her ſelfe by one oath, ſhe impoſed upon
him another, namely, that till that time of her widdowhood,
he ſhould neither aſſociate himſelfe privately, converſe nor
contract matrimony with any woman whatſoever. Theſe
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:57230:152"/>
things thus accorded betwixt them, yet the fathers conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
ſo far prevailed with the ſons obedience, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
many urgent and important meſſages from
the good old man the husband (who wondered what di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſte
might breed his ſudden diſcontinuance, as ſuſpecting
nothing from either) he ſtill excuſed his abſence and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore
the houſe. It hapned that ſome months after riding to
a market Town not far off, equally diſtant betwixt his own
fathers houſe and the old gentlemans, to give a meeting
to ſome Gentlemen of the Country, by chance he hapned
upon a chambermaid that belonged to his betro hed mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſte,
whom he well knew; he ſaluted her, and ſhe him, and
after ſome complement paſt betwixt them, he asking how
every body did at home, and ſhe on the other ſide wondring

and how much deſired of all the houſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> theſe things
over he entreated her to drink a cup of wine, which the
maid willingly accepted. They being alone, and falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
diſcourſe of many old paſſages well known to them
both, the young man began to ſpeak how much he reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
her miſtreſſe, and how dea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ly tendred her honour: ſhe
on the other ſide began a contrary diſcourſe, as that for
his own part ſhe knew him to be a noble Gentleman, and
wel parted, one whom her old maſter affected above al men;
proceeding, that ſhe was not altogether ignorant what fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarities
had paſt betwixt him and her miſtreſſe, who only
bore him faire outwardly and in ſhew, when another enjoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
both her heart and body inwardly and in act<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that
upon her own knowledge; and to confirm he accuſation,
nominated the man (who was his neereſt and moſt familiar
friend.) At this report the Gentleman was ſtartled, but bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
conſidering with himſelfe, told her he thankt her for
her love, but could by no means beleeve her relation;
fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſt, by reaſon he knew her Ladies breeding, and was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
in her known modeſty and vertue, as having himſelf
made tryall of both to the uttermoſt, having time, place and
opportunity, all things that might beget temptation. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
for his friend, in all their continuall and daily conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,
he never perceived either familiar diſcourſe, wanton
behaviour, or ſo much as the leaſt glance of eie to paſſe
ſuſpitiouſly betwixt them. To which ſhe anſwered, it was
ſo much the more cunningly carried; for her own part ſhe
had but done the office of a friend, and ſo left him, but in a
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:57230:153"/>
thouſand ſtrange cogitations: yet love perſwading above
jealouſie, he began to interate and call to mind, with what
an outward integrity ſhe had ſtill borne her ſelfe towards
him, and with a purity by no womans art to be diſtembled.
Next he bethought himſelfe, that perhaps the maid might
be fallen in love with him, and by this calumny might ſeek
to divert him from the affection of her miſtreſſe; or elſe
ſhe had taken ſome diſpleaſure againſt her, and by this
means thought to revenge her ſelfe. In the midſt of theſe
apprehenſions, or rather diſtractions, came another letter
from the husband, complaining of his abſence, wondring at
the cauſe, and urgently deſiring his company, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſo private, where he would reconcile himſelfe touching
any unkindneſſes that might be conceived, and withall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
him what he ſhould truſt to concerning ſome part of
his lands. The Gentleman ſtill remembring his fathers
charge, yet thought a little to diſpenſe with it, and writ back
word (knowing every part of the houſe by reaſon of his
long frequenting it) That if he pleaſed to leave his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
door open at ſuch a time of the night, he would accept
of ſuch proviſion as he found, and be merry with him for an
houre or two, and give good reaſon for his unwilling diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continuance:
but thus provided, that neither wife, friend,
nor ſervant (ſaving that one whom he truſted with his meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage)
might be acquainted with his comming in or going
out. This was concluded, the time of night appointed, and
every thing accordingly provided: They met, he old man
gave him kind and freely entertainment, ſeeming overjoied
with his company, and demanding the reaſon of his ſo great
ſtrangeneſſe, He anſwered, that notwithſtanding his own
innocence, and his wives approved Temperance, yet bad
tongues had been buſie to their reproach, meaſuring them
by their own corrupt inte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ts, and therefore to avoid all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
whatſoever, his ſtudy was, by taking away the cauſe
to prevent the effect; his reaſon was approved, and the
old man ſatisfied concerning both their integrities. Time
cals the old man to his bed, and the young Gentleman is
left to his reſt, purpoſing to be gone early in the morning,
before any of the houſhold ſhould be awake or ſtirring. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
now alone and not able to ſleep in regard of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
diſtracted fancies that were pondering in his mind
and brain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he aroſe from his bed, and walking up and down
the chamber, after ſome meditation, as of her beautie, her
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:57230:153"/>
vowes, her proteſtation, her oaths, all pleading together in
behalfe of her innocency ſo far prevailed with him, That
conſidering he was now in the ſame houſe, and that by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the old mans age, they very often lay aſunder, that he
was acquainted with every ſtaire-caſe, and knew the ready
way to her chamber; Love conquering all ſuſpicion, he
purpoſed once more to viſit the place where he had (but
ever honeſtly) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> with her at all houres, and where their
intended marriage was by interchange of oaths at firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed.
With this purpoſe ſtealing ſoftly up the ſtairs, and
liſtning at the door before he would preſume to knock, he
might heare a ſoft whiſpering, which ſometimes growing
louder, he might plainly diſtinguiſh two voices (hers, and
that Gentlemans his ſuppoſed friend, whom the maid had
had before nominated) where he might evidently under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
more then proteſtations paſſe betwixt them, namely,
the mechall ſinne it ſelfe. At this being beyond thought ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ſcarce knowing how to contein himſelfe for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
he remembred him of his ſword in his chamber, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he went inſtantly with intent to return, and breaking
open the door, to tranſpierce them both in the adulterate
act: but better judgement guiding him, conſidering what
murder was, and the baſeneſs to become a perſonal executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner,
withall remembring her beauty, their often meetings,
kiſſes and embraces; his heart became too tender to deſtroy
that goodly frame, in which nature had ſhewed her beſt of
art, though the devill his worſt of envy. Therefore he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
made himſelfe ready, left the place, and without the
knowledge of any man, or diſcovering to any what had
paſt, returned to his fathers: where pondering at full with
himſelfe, the nature of his abuſe (being beyond example)
the ſtrictneſſe of his oath, being not only debarred from
marriage, but as it were baniſhed from the ſociety of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;
that ſhe only reſerved him as a ſtale or ſhadow, whilſt
another carried away the ſubſtance; that ſhe kept her ſelfe
to be his wife, and anothers whore; and that from all theſe
no ſafe evaſion could be deviſed to come off towards her
like a Gentleman, or towards God like a Chriſtian, all theſe
injuries jointly conſidered, drove him into a ſuddain me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy,
that melancholy into a doubtfull ſickneſſe, and

the counſell of his beſt friends comforted, he at length ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered

importunity of his own father he was forced to accompany
him thither, where he muſt of neceſſity take another view

ſhe ſingles him for a farewell, weeping in his boſome, wrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging

But inſtead of a reply he delivered her a letter, which

This man ſued a divorce, and was ſeparated from his wife

inſomuch, that he not only greatly deſired to ſee her, but
purpoſed that if her beauty were any way anſwerable to
that which fame had blazoned her to be, to make her his
Queen. This ſecret apprehenſion he communicated to one
Earl <hi>Ethelwold</hi> a Noble Gentleman, in his great favour
and beſt acquainted with his privacies, commanding him to
make a journy to the Earl of Devonſhire her father, and
there to take of her a free and full ſurveigh, and finding
her anſwerable to the publike rumour, not only to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
her of the Earl <hi>Orgarus,</hi> but to bring her along with
her father, roially attended like the bride of a King, to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
with him all regall honours. This journy <hi>Ethelwold</hi>
with great willingneſſe undertakes, without diſcloſing to
any the ſecrets of his meſſage: and comming to the place
where the damoſell with her father then ſojourned, he was
nobly enterteined, as a fellow peer, and an eſpeciall favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
to the King. No ſooner came the Lady in preſence, but
<hi>Ethelwold</hi> began to conceive that report had been too nig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardly
in her praiſe, for he had not in his life time ſeen a
Lady of ſo incomparable a feature, to whom all the Court-beauties
appeared ſcarce good Chriſtall to that unmatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Diamond. What cannot love work in the heart of
man, when ſuch a beauty is his object? it makes the ſon for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
his father, and the father not remember that he hath a
ſon, but either hath made the others bed inceſtuous: It
hath ſubjected Cities, and depopulated Countries, made
the ſubject forget his allegeance to his ſoveraign, and the
ſoveraign moſt unnaturall and inhumane to his ſubject, as
may appear by this hiſtory. This Earl ſurpriſed with the
love of this Lady, hath either quite forgot the meſſage he
was ſent about, or elſe is not pleaſed to remember it. Not
ſpeaking of the King at all, but counterfeting ſome occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
into that Country, and as if he had hapned upon that
place by accident, or come to give him viſitation in noble
courteſy; at ſupper finds diſcourſe concerning the Lady, and
at length prevailed ſo far with the old Earl, that they were
contracted that night, and the next morning married. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſome few daies journie there, the Kings impoſitions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced
him to take an unwilling farewel of his new marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
bride, only at parting he earneſtly intreated them for
divers reaſons which much imported him, to keep the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
as ſecret as poſſibly might be, and ſo poſted back to

<pb n="278" facs="tcp:57230:156"/>
concerning the beauty of the Lady, how tall, how ſtrait,
of what haire, what complection, whether her looks were
cheerfull or ſad, her behaviour ſober or ſuſpitious. To all
which he anſwered in few, ſhe was indeed a Lady, and that
was her beſt, an Earls daughter and therefore flattered, for
what in a private woman is commendable, is in ſuch excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent;
and what in the former praiſe worthy, in the latter <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
and admirable: but for this Lady <hi>Elfritha,</hi> ſhe was a courſe
home ſpun peece of fleſh, whoſe nobility and dower might
make her capable of being wife to ſome honeſt Juſtice of
peace, or Sheriffe of the Shire, but not becomming the bed
of any of the nobility (unleſſe ſome one whoſe eſtate was
decaid;) indeed a meer Rook, and moſt unworthy the eie
of the Princely Eagle. With this anſwer the King was ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfi'd,
and for the preſent diſpos'd his affection elſewhere, i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magining
theſe praiſes might be divulg'd abroad as wel in
ſcorn of her perſon as otherwiſe, ſo for ſome few weeks it
reſted: in which interim <hi>Ethelwold</hi> was oft miſt in the
Court, and diſcontinued his wonted ſervice, no man could
ſcant tell or inform the King how he diſpoſed himſelfe, and
ſtill when he came to preſent his ſervice, he would excuſe
his abſence with ſome infirmity or other, which was the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of his inforced retirement: beſides, he was often obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to intreat leave to recreate himſelfe in the Country, and
take the benefit of the freſh aire, as commodious for his
health, in all which liberty he paſt his limits. This bred
ſome jealouſie in the King, and the rather, becauſe the
fame of this Ladies unmatched beauty more and more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed.
Therefore to be more punctually informed of the
truth, he ſent another private meſſenger, who brought him
intelligence how all things ſtood, with the certeinty of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
accident how it befell. The King not knowing how to
diſgeſt ſuch an injury from a ſubject, ſmothered his grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
for a ſpace, and at length cauſed the geſts to be
drawn, for he purpoſed a progreſſe into the Weſt. <hi>Ethelwold</hi>
yet nothing ſuſpecting, was the formoſt man to attend the
King upon his journie: but when they came almoſt to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,
he began to miſtruſt the Kings purpoſe, the rather
becauſe he ſent to the Earl <hi>Orgarus,</hi> that at ſuch a time he
meant to feaſt with him. Now muſt <hi>Ethelwold</hi> beſtir himſelf,
or inſtantly hazard the Kings high diſpleaſure: he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
poſts in the night to his wife, and to his father in law,
reports the truth of every circumſtance from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:57230:156"/>
how he was ſent by the King, and to what purpoſe,
how her beauty had ſo enflamed him, that he was compelled
by violence of affection, to deceive the Kings truſt; and
laſtly, to ſecure his own life, which for the love of her he
had hazarded<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he was forced to diſparage her feature, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble
her worth, and diſgrace her beauty: and therefore
beſought her, as ſhe tendred his ſafety being her husband,
either not to appear before the King at all, or if ſhe were
called for and ſo compelled, to be ſeen in that faſhion as he
had deſcribed her to his ſoveraign, namely, with a ſmodged
face, counterfeit haire, uncomely habit, and in her behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
to put on ſuch a garb of folly as might rather breed
loathing then liking in his majeſty. The firſt of his ſpeech
ſhe heard with patience, but when he came to deliver to her
how he had diſparaged her beauty, and, to the King too;
nay more, would have her derogate from her own worth,
and be acceſſary to the blaſting of that beauty which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
had made ſo admirable, this her womaniſh ſpleen
could hardly diſgeſt; yet ſhe ſoothed him up with fair and
promiſing language, and told him ſhe would better conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of it, and ſo diſmiſſed him in part ſatisfied. In the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
he preſented himſelfe early to attend the King, who
was that day to be enterteined by the Earle his father in
law. All things were nobly provided, and <hi>Edgar</hi> roially
received and ſet to dinner (ſome write that <hi>Ethelwold</hi> had
cauſed a kitchin maid to put on his wives habit, and ſit at
the Kings table, but I find no ſuch matter remembred in
my author) the truth is, the King about the middeſt of din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
called for the Earle <hi>Orgarus,</hi> and demanded of him whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he had a wife or no, if he had, why he might not have
her company, knowing it was a general obſervation in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
that without the wives entertainment, there could be
no true and hearty welcome? The Earl replied, that at
that time he was an unhappy widdower: he then deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
whether he had any children to continue his poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie?
to which he anſwered, Heaven had only bleſt him with
one daughter, a plain damoſell, yet the ſole hope of his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
memory. The King was then importunate to ſee her,
and commanded her to be inſtantly brought unto his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence;
which put <hi>Ethelwold</hi> into a ſtrange agony, yet ſtill
hoping ſhe had done as he had lately enjoined her, when ſhe

the ſon of <hi>Charls,</hi> cauſed <hi>William Longa Spata</hi> the Duke of
Normandy to be treacherouſly ſlain: this <hi>William</hi> was ſon
to <hi>Rollo.</hi> The Lords of Normandy with this murder much
incenſed, watched their advantage, and ſurpriſed the King
in Rhothemage, where they committed him to ſafe cuſtody
till he had promiſed and ſworn to yeeld up Normandy to
<hi>Richard</hi> ſon and immediate heire to <hi>William</hi> the late mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
Duke, and moreover, in what place ſoever the King
and the young Duke ſhould have meeting to confer, that
<hi>Richard</hi> ſhould car his ſword, but King <hi>Lewis</hi> neither to
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:57230:157"/>
have ſword nor knife about him. This <hi>Richard</hi> being young,
was called <hi>Richard</hi> the Old; he had beſides another attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
given him, which was, <hi>Richard</hi> without Feare, becauſe
he was never known to be diſmaid at any thing; but a third
above theſe was, that he pretended to be wondrous religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
He was Duke two and fifty years, and took a Lady to
his bed from Denmark, whoſe name was <hi>Gunnora,</hi> by whom
he had five ſons and two daughters, the eldeſt of which was
married to <hi>Etheldredus</hi> King of England,<note place="margin">Emma.</note> her name was <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi>

other teſtimonies of his ſanctity, this one made him moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent,
A Monk of Andoenus in Rothomage a Town in
Normandy, going one night to meet with his Sweet heart,
his way lay over a bridge,<note place="margin">A ſtrange Tale.</note> and under that bridge was a deep
foord or river, it ſo hapned, that miſtaking his footing, he
fell into the water, and there was drowned. He was no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
dead, but there came to carry away his ſoul, an Angel
and a Fiend, theſe two contended about it, the one would
have it, ſo would the other, great was the controverſie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them; at length they concluded to put the caſe to
Duke <hi>Richard,</hi> and both to ſtand to his arbitriment: much
pleading there was on both ſides, at length the Duke gave
ſentence, That the ſoul ſhould be reſtor'd again to the body,
and be placed again upon that bridge from whence he had
falne, and if then he would offer to go from thence to his
Sweet heart, the Devill ſhould take him; but if otherwiſe,
he (becauſe he was a Church-man) ſhould be ſtill in the
Angels protection. This was done, and the Monk left his
way to the woman, and fled to the Church, as to a ſanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
whither the Duke went the next day, and found the
Monks cloths ſtill wet, and told the Abbot every circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
as it fell out; therefore the Monk was ſhriven, did
penance, was abſolved and reconciled. This I have read,
which I perſwade no man to beleeve. This Duke lived with
the faire <hi>Gunnora</hi> long time diſhoneſtly, and without mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
had by her thoſe children aforeſaid, but at length by
the perſwaſion of the nobility, and interceſſion of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
he took her to wife. The firſt night after the marriage,
when the Duke came to her bed, ſhe turned her back to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him, which ſhe had never done till that time: at
which he marvelling, demanded of her the reaſon why ſhe
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:57230:158"/>
did ſo. To whom ſhe anſwered, before I was your ſtrumpet,
and therefore as a ſervant was tied to do your pleaſure in
all things, but now I am your wife, and made part of your
ſelfe, therefore henceforth I claime with you an equall ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty,
and will do what me liſt, bearing my ſelfe now
like a Princeſſe, not like a proſtitute. This I am eaſily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced

upon a time hearing where a Noble Lady was in child-birth,

her ſelfe to her help, whom the modeſt Lady (miſtaking her
Sex) would by no perſwaſion ſuffer her to come neer her,
till ſhe was forced to ſtrip her ſelfe before the women, and
to give evident ſigne of her woman-hood. After which ſhe
had acceſſe to many, proving ſo fortunate, that ſhe grew ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

then any way a curer of their infirmities; blaming the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons
as counterfeiting weakneſſe, purpoſely to have the

were ready to proceed to ſentence againſt her; when ſhe
opening her breſt before the Senate, gave manifeſt teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
that ſhe was no other then a woman: at this the
Phyſitians being the more incenſ'd, made the fact the more
heinous, in regard that being a woman, ſhe durſt enter into
the ſearch of that knowledge, of which their Sex by the law
was not capable. The cauſe being ready again to go againſt
her, the nobleſt matrons of the City aſſembled themſelves
before the Senate, and plainly told them, they were rather
enemies then husbands, who went about to puniſh her,
that of all their Sex had bin the moſt ſtudious for their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall

as if ſhe meant better to conſider of the matter, (when they

remember her devoutly in their praiers, which ſhe knew
would be acceptable to him, for whoſe love they ſo freely
offered up their lives. The Officers this hearing, dragged
her before the Preſident, who at firſt deſpiſing her youth,
began to talk with her as to a child, but finding her anſwers
modeſt and weighty, began further to argue with her; but
ſeeing himſelfe unable to hold argument as being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced

in all things, he grew into ſuch a malitious rage,

prevailing, he commanded her inſtantly to be dragged
from thence, and from an high place to be caſt headlong
into the ſea. I will conclude this diſcourſe of Martyrs, with

offenſive. He anſwered him, his maſter kept great ſtore of
pullen about the houſe, and that was all Hens dung. Hens
dung ſaith the Gentleman, I have a peece of land at home,
I would it were all there, if thou canſt help me to any quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of it (being ſure that is ſuch) I will give thee twenty
ſhillings a load for as much as thou canſt provide, and
fetch it away with my own carriage. The fellow hearing
this, promiſed within a month to furniſh him with twenty
load at leaſt at the ſame price. The match was made, and the
Gentleman after breakfaſt took horſe and departed. The
hoſtler beſpeaks all ſuch ſoile as the Town could affoard,
or the next Villages by, and made ſuch a huge heap as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noied
the whole yard (knowing the Gentleman to have been
ever a man of his word) who came according to the time
appointed. The hoſtler is glad to ſee him, and tels him he

to give him preſent paiment, but withall asked him, Art thou

of the Amazons, and why they were firſt ſo called, divers
authors have diverſly writ. <hi>Palaephatus</hi> in his fabulous nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
<note place="margin">Lib. 1. cap. de Amazonib.</note> ſaith, The Amazons were not women, but certaine
barbarous men who uſed to weare long garments, and
looſe, reaching below their ancles after the manner of the
Thracian women, who ſhaved their chins, and wore
the hairs of their head long, but covered with miters:
Theſe Amazons were a warlike people, and did ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
brave and remarkable deeds of arms. But there is no
likelihood (ſaith he) that ſuch ſhould be women, becauſe of
that nation there is at this day no memory: but this was but
his opinion. <hi>Trogus Pompeius,</hi> from whom <hi>Iuſtine</hi> extracts
his hiſtory, thus ſpeaks of their originall. Scythia towards

the King in battell, and kept him priſoner at Briſtoll, from

victory the people came againſt her with proceſſion, which
was approved by the Popes legate. From Briſtol ſhe came

               <p>IT is reported of a King, that for many yeers had no iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue,
and deſirous to have an heire of his own blood and
begetting to ſucceed in the throne, upon his earneſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication

ſon, both of beauty and hope. And now being poſſeſſed of
what he ſo much deſired, his ſecond care was to ſee him ſo
educated, that he might have as much comfort of him in his
growth, as hope in his infancy: he therefore ſent abroad to
find out the moſt cunning Aſtrologians to calculate his
nativity, that if the ſtars were any way malevolent to him
at his birth, he might by inſtruction and good education
(as far as was poſſible) prevent any diſaſter that the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets
had before threatned. A meeting to that purpoſe being

eſpecially from the cuſtome of the Perſians, ſent to <hi>Amaſa</hi>
King of the Aegyptians, to demand his only daughter in
marriage. The King ſomething troubled at this Embaſſie,
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:57230:194"/>
as fearing he would rather keep his daughter as a concubin
then to give her the right of her birth, and to honor her with
the titles of a Queen and Bride, he deviſed this policy to
delude <hi>Cambyſes,</hi> and ſtill to conſerve her chaſtity: he had
there in his Court a young Lady, called <hi>Nitetis,</hi> the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of <hi>Aprias</hi> an Aegyptian, whom becauſe he had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated

to be ſlain. This <hi>Nitetis</hi> being the prime and choice
beauty of the Court, in all her lineaments ſo exquiſite, that
he preſumed ſhe would not only content, but much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
the King: he inſtructed her how to take upon her
the name of his daughter, and in every circumſtance and
complement, how to demean her ſelfe, ſo with a Princely
train accommodates her for the journie. Being arrived in
Perſia, ſhe was reially enterteined by the King, her beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
and beauty more pleaſing him then any of his choice
damoſels ſelected out of his many Provinces: inſomuch,
that he haſtned the marriage, which was with no ſmall
pomp, according to the manner of the Perſians <hi>Nitetis</hi> lying
in the Kings boſome, and knowing how much ſhe was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deared
to him, as now not caſting his eie or affection upon
any other, began to call to remembrance her fathers death,
and what a plain and ſmooth way lay open to her, to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged
on him that ſlew him; and forgetting the honours
ſhe had received by <hi>Amaſa</hi>'s means, in preferring her to be
Queen of Perſia; not rating that good, equall with the ill
ſhe received in the ſhedding of her fathers blood: ſhe ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to <hi>Cambyſes</hi> all the whole impoſture, withall importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
him to revenge the death of her father <hi>Aprias.</hi> The
King as much pleaſed with her plain and ſeeming ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
as incenſed with ſo great an injury done to him by <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſa,</hi>
as well to revenge her father, as his own wrongs,
with an invincible army invaded Aegypt. <hi>Dinon</hi> in his
book of the Perſian Hiſtory, and <hi>Lynceas Naucratica</hi> in his
Aegyptian Hiſtory, they agree that <hi>Nitetis</hi> was ſent to <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi>
and that by him ſhe was the mother of <hi>Cambyſes,</hi> and
that after the death of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> the Army with which he went
againſt <hi>Amaſa</hi> and invaded Aegypt, was to revenge the
wrongs of a mother, and not a wife.</p>

great incivility and immodeſty to behold a man, much more
a woman, naked.) The next morning, by ſuch ſervants as
ſhe beſt truſted, ſhe cauſed <hi>Gyges</hi> to be ſent for, who (miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubting
nothing that had paſt, as one that had many

her ſervants to withdraw themſelves, thus beſpake him:
<q>Two waies are propoſed thee, O <hi>Gyges,</hi> and one of them
inſtantly and without leaſt premeditation to make choiſe
of; Either thou muſt kill <hi>Candaules,</hi> and that done, be
poſſeſſed of me, and with me the Crown of Lydia, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
die; for thy doom is already determined of, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
thou ſhalt know that in all things it is not conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
to obey the King, or ſearch into that which thou
oughteſt not to know: There is now a neceſſity, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he that counſelled thee to this muſt periſh, or thou
that obeiedſt him againſt all Law or Juſtice, to behold me
(againſt reaſon or modeſty) naked.</q> 
                  <hi>Gyges</hi> at theſe words
was firſt wondrouſly amazed, but after recollecting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
entreated her not to compell him to ſo hard an exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
as to the choice of either. But finding that neceſſity,
that he muſt be forced to one or the other, to kill the King,
or to be ſlain by others; he rather made choice to ſurvive,
and let the other periſh, and thus anſwered her: Since (ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
Lady) you urge me to an enterprize ſo much op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite
to my milder nature and diſpoſition, propoſe ſome
ſafe courſe how this may de done. Even (ſaith ſhe) in the
ſelfe-ſame place where he deviſed this miſchiefe againſt
himſelfe (namely, his bed-chamber) where to thee I was firſt
diſcovered. Therefore providing all things neceſſary for ſo
determinate a purpoſe, and the night comming on, <hi>Gyges</hi>
(who knew no evaſion, but to kill his maſter or die him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe)
awaited his beſt advantage, and having notice when
<hi>Candaules</hi> was aſleep, followed the Queen into her chamber,
and with a Ponyard (by her provided for the purpoſe) ſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
him to the heart, by which he attained both the Queen
and Kingdome. Of this hiſtory, <hi>Archilochus Parius</hi> makes

after ſo many troubles and torments, purpoſed a more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtred
life, and (next the ſolace he had in the beauty and
vertues of his wife) to take a courſe meerly contemplative:
and thought out of the abundance of his wealth, to do ſome
pious deeds for the good of his ſoul: he therefore erected
in the City, and neer to the place where his houſe ſtood, a
goodly Church at his own charge, and betwixt them a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
houſe that entertained twelve Friers and an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot,
allowing them demeans competent for ſo ſmall a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-hood:
In this covent there were two, Frier <hi>John</hi> and
Frier <hi>Richard;</hi> theſe were ſtill at continuall enmity, and
eſpeciall notice taken of it among the reſt, which by no me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation,
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:57230:197"/>
could be truly reconciled: but omitting that, it was
the cuſtome of the Knight and his Lady, daily to riſe to
morning Mattins, and ſhe being affable and courteous to
all, it bred a ſtrange incivil boldneſſe in Frier <hi>John,</hi> for ſhe
never came through the Cloiſter, but he was ſtill with ducks
and cringes attending her, which ſhe (ſuſpecting nothing)
ſimply with modeſt ſmiles returned thanks to him again:
which grew ſo palpable in the Frier, that as farre as they
durſt it was whiſpered in the covent. Briefly after theſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements
(as he conſtrued them) it bred in him that
impudency, that he preſumed to write a letter to her, in
which he laid open a great deal of more then neceſſary love
This letter with great difficulty came to her hand; at which
the Lady aſtoniſhed, as not dreaming that ſuch lewdneſſe
ſhould come from one that profeſſed chaſtity, and not
knowing whether it might be a trick complotted by her
husband to make triall of her chaſtity: howſoever, leſt her
honour ſhould be any way called in queſtion, ſhe thought
it the beſt and ſafeſt courſe to ſhew the letter to her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band;
of which he had no ſooner took a view, but he began
to repent him of his former charity, in regard of their ſo
great ingratitude. But there yet wants revenge for ſo great
a wrong, the Knight concealing his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>age, cauſes an anſwer
of this letter to be drawn to which he commanded her to ſet
to her hand; the contents to this effect, That ſhe was great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
compaſſionate of his Love, and that ſuch a night her
husband being to ride towards London, he ſhould be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
lodged and entertained, according to his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires.
This letter was ſealed, cloſely ſent, received by the
Frier with joy unſpeakable: againſt the night he provides
him clean linnen, a perfumed night-cop, and other neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;
he keeps the time, obſerves the place, is cloſely admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and by her ſelfe without witneſſe, and ſo conveied him
into a cloſe chamber. Which he was no ſooner entred, but
in comes the Knight with his man, and in great fury, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
giving him the leaſt time either to call for help to the
houſe or to heaven, ſtrangled the poor Frier, and left him
dead upon the ground. The deed was no ſooner done, and
his rage ſomewhat appeaſed, but he began to enter into
conſideration of the foulneſſe of the fact, and heinouſneſſe
of the murder, withall the ſtrict penalty of the law due for
ſuch an offence, which would be no leſſe then forfeiture of
life and eſtate; and now he begins better to ponder with
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:57230:198"/>
himſelfe how to prevent the laſt, which may give him fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
leaſure to repent the firſt. After divers and ſundry pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
caſt betwixt him and his man, it came into his mind,
by ſome means or other to have his body conveied back in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Monaſtery, which being divided from his houſe on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with a brick wall, might be done without any great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty:
this was no ſooner motioned, but inſtantly his man
remembers him of a ladder in the back-yard fit for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe;
briefly, they both lay hand to the body, and the man
with the Frier on his back mounts the ladder, and ſits with
him aſtride upon the wall, then drawing up the ladder to
the contrary ſide, deſcends with him down into the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery,
where ſpying the houſe of office, he ſet him upon the

therefore thinking this counterfeit deaſneſſe to be done of

ſnatcht up a brick-bat to be revenged, and hitting his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary

verily beleeves that he had ſlain him. What ſhall he now

carries him into the porch of the Knights hall, and there

and having paſt the length of the hall, purpoſing to
go through the yard, finds Frier <hi>Iohn</hi> ſitting upright in the

to make tryall of a deſperate adventure, and put the
diſcovery theirof to accident: he remembers an old ſtallion,
that had been a horſe of ſervice, then in his ſtable, one of

to be brought, with ſtrong new cords, a caſe of ruſty Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtols,
and a Lance. The horſe is ladled and cappariſon'd, the

things were thus in fitting, Frier <hi>Richard</hi> in the Monaſtery,
no leſſe perplexed in conſcience then the Knight, about
the murther, caſting all doubts, and ſtil dreading the ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the Law, ſummons all his wits about him to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the worſt; at length ſets up his reſt, that it his beſt and

belonging to the Frierie a Mare, emploied to carry corn to
and fro from the Mil (which was ſome halfe a mile from the
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:57230:199"/>
Monaſtery) being ſomewhat fat, and therefore doubting
his own footmanſhip, he thinks it the ſafer courſe to truſt
to four legs then to two, he therefore cals up the Baker that
had the charge of the beaſt, and tels him, he underſtands
there was Meal that morning to be fetcht from the Mill,
which was grinded by that time; therefore if he would let
him have the Mare, he would (it being now night) ſave
him that labour, and bring it back before morning. The fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
willing to ſpare ſo much pains, cauſed the back gate
to be opened. The Frier gets us, and rides out of the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery
gate, juſt at the inſtant when the Knight and his man
had turned out the Frier on horſeback to ſeek his fortune,
the horſe preſently ſeems the Mare, and after her he gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lops.
Frier <hi>Richard</hi> looking back amazed to have an armed
Knight purſue him, and by the Moon-light perceiving the
Frier armed (for he might diſcern his face partly by the
Moon, and partly by the breaking of the day, his Beaver be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

ſleeps and morning reſts, from their windowes looked out.
At length it was Frier <hi>Richards</hi> ill fate to take into a turn-again-lane,
that had no paſſage through; there Frier <hi>Iohn</hi>
overtakes him: the Horſe mounts the Mare, and with his vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent

noiſe; Frier <hi>Richards</hi> burthened conſcience clamours out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud
for help, and withall cries, Guilty of the murther:

<hi>Phaillus</hi> fitting his wives feet with rich embroidered Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toffes,
jewels about her haire, rings on her fingers, brace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets
about her wriſts, and carkanets upon her arm, in a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonian

of a hat, which was onely lawfull for the Kings themſelves
to wear: And in this manner habited like one of the Kings
Pages, but ſo diſguiſed, that ſhe was ſcarce known of any;
he ſubmitted her to the King. There are too many in our

deſired to ſee what ſhe carried ſo tenderly in her arms:
the nurſe told her it was an infant, but ſuch an one as ſhe
was loath to ſhew, and therefore deſired to be excuſed, the

Go nurſe, and bear her home to her parents, who ſhall in
time become the moſt beautifull of all the Spartan Ladies.
From that time forward, her deformity began to fall away,

her womb and bowels; and they were as freſh and faire

Thoſe that ſtood by wondring at the object, one Clerk

by which ſuch felicity is attained, that their ſouls are not
only glorified in Heaven, but their bodies are not ſubject
to corruption on earth. But becauſe the Theam I am next

this <hi>Philip</hi> did often ſollicite and exhort him to
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:57230:209"/>
leave his Judaiſme, and be a convert, and turn to the
Chriſtian religion: to whom he anſwered, Indeed he muſt
ingeniouſly confeſſe, he made no queſtion but that Jeſus
whom the Chriſtians adored, was the ſame Meſſias of whom
the holy Prophets foretold, yet he could not be perſwaded
to relinquiſh the honours and profits that he had amongſt
his own Nation, and give himſelfe up to a name which they
knew not, or at leaſt would not acknowledge: yet that he
beleeved ſo of Chriſt, he was not only perſwaded by the
Oracles of the holy Prophets, but he found it approved by
a certain myſtery, namely, a writing moſt charily ſtil kept
amongſt the Jewes, in a place moſt ſafe and ſecret, where
their choice records with the eſpecialleſt care and truſt are
reſerved; which was of this nature: It was a cuſtome amongſt
the Jewiſh Nation, at what time the holy Temple was yet
ſtanding in Jeruſalem, to have continually the number of
22 chief and ſelected Prieſts (juſt ſo many as there be
letters in the Hebrew language, or books of the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
and ſo often as any of theſe was taken away by death,
immediately another was elected to ſucceed in his place;
and being choſen (in a book kept in the treaſury for that
only purpoſe) expreſsly to write down his own name, and
the names of both his parents, with the daies punctually ſet
down of the deceaſe of the one and the ſucceſſion of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Now in the time that Chriſt was converſant in Judaea,
and yet had not ſhewed himſelfe to the world, nor preached
the Word openly to the people, it hapned that one of the
Prieſts of the foreſaid number died, neither after many voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and ſundry nominations was any agreed upon, or
thought fit to be aſcribed into his place. At length was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
JESUS, the ſon of the Carpenter <hi>Ioſeph</hi> (for ſo
they termed him) a man though young, yet for the ſanctity
of his life, his behaviour and doctrine, above all the reſt
commended. This ſuffrage ſtanding, as having generall
approbation from all, it was convenient to ſend for his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
(for his father <hi>Ioſeph</hi> was late dead) into the Conſiſtory,
only to know their names, and to regiſter them in the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid

with the eies of <hi>Lyvia,</hi> that is, to hold them but as beautifull

that in all that time he never touched the body of a woman,

and having a fair eſtate purchaſed with his ſmall
charge and great husbandry, and therefore willing to draw
out the thread of his life to what length he could, he ſent
to demand the counſell of the Phyſitians; who having well
conſidered the eſtate of his body, all agreed in this, that
ſince the Phyſick of the ſoul belonged not to them, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

dangerous, and they found but only one way in art for his
cure and recovery, which was in plain terms, To uſe the
company of a woman, and ſo took their leaves and left him
to conſider of it. Loath was the old man to loſe his Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity

his life, which he deſired to keep yet longer; and having
meditated with himſelfe from whom he was to depart, and

his neighbours, friends, and kindred, and whether he was

The next day divers of his friends comming to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort

could they wean him from that extaſie: at length the one of
them who was privy to the former nights paſſage, began to

A tale ſomething like unto theſe, I have been told of a
Miſtreſſe, that in ſome ſort did as much to ſave her maids
honeſty; but whether to the ſame commendable purpoſe, of
that I am ſomewhat doubtfull. In ſome great City it was (I
cannot ſay London) that a Citizen of good reckoning ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a fair wife, kept divers prentices and maid-ſervants in
his houſe: one of thoſe buſie young fellowes had caſt a
wanton eie upon her that ruled the roſt in the Kitchin, and
longing as much to be in her books, as out of his time; and
waiting many nights for opportunity to find her in ſome
remote place, or dark entry, it hapned that one night he
dogg'd her at the heels: ſhe hearing him to tread ſoftly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
her, to eſcape him ſtept up a pair of ſtairs juſt as her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe
came down. The prentice groping in the dark, catcht
hold upon his Miſtreſſe, and without any word ſpeaking,
began to proportion his work according to the ſhortneſſe of
his time. The Gentlewoman all this while let him alone
to ſee what he would do, and having made proof of him to
the full, ſhe might very well perceive what his unchaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
was, when clinging him cloſe to her leſt he ſhould
eſcape undiſcovered, She asked what bold ſawcy knave
he was that durſt offer her that injury? the young fellow
knowing her voice, and finding his miſtake, down on his
knees and beſought her to pardon him and not to tell his
Maſter, for he took her for one of the maids: The maids
ſaith ſhe, which of the maids? he anſwered, The Kitchin-maid:
and is it ſo (ſaith ſhe) well <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

pickt a quarrell with the Kitchin-wench, paid her her wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
and turn'd her away. It ſeems after, the young man did
well, for ſhe made him (before his time was fully out) both
her journeyman and foreman. It followes next in courſe,
that I ſhould define unto you, what theſe proſtitutes and
common women are; but what need I trouble my ſelfe ſo
far, when in theſe corrupt daies, almoſt every boy of fifteen
or ſixteen years old, knowes what a ſtrumpet is, better by his
own practiſe, then I can illuſtrate to him by all my reading.

Heroes of Greece frequented, and extaſi'd with her beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,

ſpeaks of her Country, behaviour and ſepulchre, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting
her to be ſo beautifull, that the moſt exquiſite Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Greece came frequently to her, and beſought her
to bare her neck, breaſts, and other parts of her body before
them: For when they were to limn any extraordinary Piece,
(wherein was to be expreſſed <hi>Juno, Venus, Pallas,</hi> or any
wel ſhaped goddeſſe or woman) her fair feature or linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
might be their example. She had a great emulation

accompany with a woman with whom many others have
had commerce. Again, being by others calumniated for his
often repair and publike recourſe to her (in regard of her
common proſtitution, and therefore the greater blemiſh to
his more auſtere profeſſion) he thus ſatisfied them: This is

once in their life times to make repair to the Temple of
<hi>Melitta</hi> (for by that name the Aſſyrians called <hi>Venus)</hi> and
ſitting in the Porch, to ſubject themſelves to the embraces
of any ſtranger. But ſome of the nobleſt and richeſt not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to publiſh themſelves to open proſtitution, were drawn
thither in Chariots covered, leaving their train and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants
behind them: many ſitting in the Temple in Pues,
or places allotted them, with garlands upon their heads; of
which, whilſt ſome are called apart, others ſtill return (for
their paſſages to and fro are diſtinguiſhed by ſmall cords
or ſtrings, which direct ſtrangers unto ſuch woman to
whom they are moſt addicted.) But of theſe not any return
to their houſes (after they have once took up their ſeats)
till ſome client hath caſt ſome coin or other into her lap
(be it never ſo ſmall or great) and have had carnall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
with her in a ſequeſtred place of the Temple: which
done, he is to ſay <hi>So much I did owe thee, O goddeſſe</hi> Melitta.
Nor was any woman to refuſe the monie that was offered
her (whatſoever it were) becauſe it was to be emploied in
their ſuppoſed pious uſes. Neither was it lawful for a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
to refuſe any man, but ſhe was compelled to follow
him that caſt the firſt coin into her apron. This being done,
it was lawfull for her to mingle her ſelfe in proſtitution

inſomuch, that in his Armour and Crown, with his Imperial

more privately. In this one thing <hi>Diodorus</hi> the minſtrel was

A noble fellow drawn as far as the Helleſport
by the attractive fame of her beauty, ſhe gave him both
meeting and entertainment: of which he growing proud,
and ſomewhat inſolent, uſing much loquacity and ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

To whom he anſwered; He did: She replied, And
do you know the name of the chiefe City there? He told
her, Yes. She then deſired him to give it name? He told
her, it was called Sygaeum. By which ſhe ingeniouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
his verboſitie; ſince <hi>Sygae</hi> (of which Greek word the

City takes denomination) ſignifieth ſilence and taciturni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Of her prompt and witty anſwers the Poet <hi>Machon</hi> ſets

years old, <hi>Truly</hi> (anſwered ſhe) <hi>it is wondrous little of the

her, and going to buffers, to him that had the worſt ſhe thus
ſaid, Deſpair nor youth, <hi>Non enim Coronarium eſt certamen ſed
Argenteum, i.</hi> This was a prize for monie only, not for a
Garland. When one had given her fair daughter (who was
of the ſame profeſſion) a piece of gold valued at a pound,
and had received no more then labour for his travell, and
bare looks for his monie, to him ſhe ſaid, Thou for this
pound art made free of my daughter, as thoſe that are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
into the ſchool of <hi>Hyppomachus</hi> the Maſter-wreſtler;
who oft times ſee him play, but ſeldome prove his ſtrength;
admire his skill, but never trie his cunning. Many ſuch
(with great elegancy) came frequently from her; for (as

Ariſtodemus</hi> in his ſecond book <hi>Ridiculorum memorab.</hi> relates,
That when two men had bargained for her at once, a ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier

To another that was removed from his command, and ſued
for a penſion, yet inſinuating with the Emperor that it was
for no covetous intent, or any hope of gain, but becauſe it
ſhould be thought, that for no criminall cauſe he was put
out of his place, and diſmiſt his office, that he deſired an

The Carthaginians gave no Portions with their Virgins,
but were only at the charge of the Nuptiall Feaſts, which
grew to be immoderate and waſteful. Amongſt the Indians
none can claim a greater Dower with his wife, then the
price of a yoke of Oxen; neither can he marry out of his
own Tribe. The Aſſyrians brought their nobleſt Virgins
into the market place, and their prices there publikely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
by the Cryer, whoſoever wanted a wife, and would
reach to the ſum propounded, might there be furniſhed;
and he that had had not ready mony, if he could put in

amongſt the Babylonians; in which they obſerved this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
They firſt ſet out to ſale the moſt ingenuous and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful,
and thoſe at an high rate; and when they were put off,
they brought forth the worſer featured, even unto the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of deformity, and then the Crier proclaims, That who
will marry any of them, he ſhall have ſo much, or ſo much,
to recompence her foulneſſe or lameneſſe. And this mony
which ſels them, is collected from the overplus of the price
of the other: ſo that the beauty of the fair ones, helps to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow
and diſpoſe of the foul. The Maſſilienſes would not

The Law of <hi>Lycurgus</hi> amongſt the Spartans was, That the

habit, be brought into her chamber by the Bride-maids,
who had before prepared it; and being left by them, the
Bridegroom then entred, and firſt unlooſing her Virgin
Girdle, he had free liberty of congreſſion. In Boeotia their

open, the other halfe covered, elſe it was not lawfull for

firſt brought forth by their neereſt kinſmen and allies, and
by them promiſcuouſly proſtituted. After which time, they
betake themſelves to all civility and continence, which
whoſoever was known to violate or digreſſe from, was moſt
ſeverely chaſtized, without all commiſeration or pity. The
ſame cuſtome is obſerved amongſt the Gymneſians, the
Lydians, and the inhabitants of the Baleares. The Andri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machides
(a people of Africa) before they can beſtow their
daughters, offer their Virginities to their Princes firſt, and
ſuch as he beſt affects he vitiates at his pleaſure, and then
they are permitted to marry. The like cuſtome was held in
Scotland: but ſince the Chriſtian Religion was there pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed,
that Law hath been there abrogated; only the maids
redeem their Virginities with a certain piece of monie, and
by that Tenure their lands are held to this day. The Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinienſes
are tied to a more baſe ſervitude, becauſe they are
compelled before marriage to proſtitute their free daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
to their ſlaves and ſervants. <hi>Alex. ab Alex. lib. 1. cap. 24.
Herodotus</hi> writes, That the Adyrmachidae preſent their
daughters maidenheads firſt to their King, ere their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trothed

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſſon Caſſannus,</hi> amongſt
many other Captains that revolted, there was one eminent
in that rebellion, called <hi>Pandoerus,</hi> who had a moſt beautiful
young wife (her age exceeded not ſixteen years) to whom
he was ardently and in conjoined love affected. He being
by her often earneſtly entreated to forbeare all conflicts
with the enemy, but by no means, either moved by her
tears, or perſwaded by her interceſſions and praiers (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
reſolute for a preſent encounter) ſhe then begged
of him. That before he hazarded himſelfe to the extremity
of danger, he would firſt take away her fears, by tranſpier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
her with his ſword: which when he likewiſe denied, he
preſently left her, and gave ſignall of battell, in which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
he was vanquiſhed and ſlain, his Tent rifled, his wife
ſurprized, and committed into the hands of one of the chief
Captains belonging to the King: who pitying her tears and
ſorrow (to which her feature and beauty gave no common
luſtre) made inſtant ſuit unto her, to make her his wife.
She (whilſt ſhe could) put him off with all poſſible delaies:
but after perceiving, that what he could not compaſſe with
her good will, he purpoſed to attain unto by compulſion
and force, ſhe craved only ſome few hours of deliberation
privately to her ſelfe: which granted, and being retired, ſhe
firſt writ in a ſhort Scedule theſe words, <hi>Let none report, that
the wife of</hi> Pandocrus <hi>harboured ſo little love, as to out-live
him.</hi> Which Note leaving upon the table, ſhe took a ſword
then hanging in the chamber, with which ſhe immediately
diſpatcht her ſelfe of life, and ſo expired, following him in
death, with whoſe life ſhe could be no longer delighted.

Dipſas</hi> is the name of an old Bawd in one of <hi>Ovid</hi>'s Elegies,
whom for inſtructing his miſtreſſe in the veneriall trade,
he reproves in theſe verſes:

heap upon them the ſins of others; as not only inticing and
alluring Virgins and young wives, to that baſe veneriall

depending thereupon, but to wear their garments by the

               <p>What, and how great joy this prodigious change was,
I leave to them that can truly apprehend the happineſſe of
ſuch a hopeleſſe and unexpected fortune betwixt two Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers:
but whether this was done meerly by the miraculous
work of the gods, or were poſſible in Nature, might be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted.
To this purpoſe, he that collected the <hi>Memorable Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories
of theſe times,</hi> hath quoted an Author, in many things
beleevable, That the like hath been known in our later
ages: yea, children have been born, that by the Midwives,
Nurſes and Parents, have been miſtaken for daughters,
and ſo continued for ſome years. But growing to the
age of twelve, or thereabouts, and are able to diſtinguiſh
of good or evil (being capable of paſſions, and ſubject to
affections) whether Love or Time hath produced theſe
ſtrange effects, I am not certain: but thoſe manly parts that
were before inverted, and concealed within the body, have
burſt forth, and been made apparent; inſomuch, that they
have been forced to change their womens names into
mens, with the exchange of their habits; and after made
choice of wives, and as this <hi>Iphis</hi> to <hi>Ianthe,</hi> have been joi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
married. <hi>Ovid</hi> in his twelfth book of <hi>Metamorphoſis,</hi>
remembers the like tranſhape from the mouth of <hi>Neſtor.
Caenis</hi> (ſaith he) the daughter of <hi>Elataeus,</hi> one of the moſt

beautiful virgins of Theſſaly, and of ſuch fame, that even
<hi>Peleus,</hi> the father of <hi>Achilles</hi> (amongſt many others) was an
earneſt ſuitor unto her to have made her his Bride and
Queen: but the proud Girl deſpiſing both his proffers and
perſon, gave him a like repulſe with the reſt, pretending a
perpetual vow of Chaſtity. At length <hi>Neptune</hi> grew ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured

her ask whatſoever was in his power (being a god) to grant,
and ſhe ſhould be recompenced to the fulneſſe of her wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es

beauty might bring her in danger of the like
violence, and to baſe proſtitution (which ſhe above all

Pope, and excuſe it thus: There was one Biſhop of Rome,
who was a decrepit and weak old man: He (by reaſon of
age) not being well able to manage his temporall affairs,
and domeſtick buſineſſe, received into his Pallace as a
guide and governeſſe, a woman called <hi>Joanna,</hi> his ſiſter or

that having the command of all things, and being
avaricious by nature, no buſineſſe was diſpatched but by
her, nor any thing concluded without her, for which ſhe
was both hated and ſcorned; and therefore upon her that
uſurped the authority of the Pope, they likewiſe beſtowed
his ſtile, and nick-named her Pope <hi>Joan.</hi> This I have not

a ſhort Character. <hi>Themiſte</hi> was the wife of <hi>Leonteius Lamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſucenus,</hi>

<hi>Epicurus:</hi> of whom <hi>Lactantius</hi> ſaith; That ſave her, none of
the Ancient Philoſophers ever inſtructed any woman in
that ſtudy, ſave that one <hi>Themiſte. Arete</hi> was the wife of
<hi>Ariſtippus</hi> the Philoſopher, and attained to that perfection
of knowledge, that ſhe inſtructed her ſon in all the libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall

He was called <hi>Ariſtippus,</hi> and ſhe ſurnamed <hi>Cyre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naica.</hi>
She followed the opinions of that <hi>Ariſtippus,</hi> who was
father to <hi>Socrates.</hi> She (after the death of her father) ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
a School of Philoſophy, where ſhe commonly read to
a full and frequent Auditory. <hi>Genebria</hi> was a woman of
Verona, ſhe lived in the time of <hi>Pius</hi> the ſecond, Biſhop of
Rome: Her works purchaſed for her a name immortal. She
compoſed many ſmooth and eloquent Epiſtles, poliſhed
both with high conceits and judgement: ſhe pronounced
with a ſharp and loud voice, a becomming geſture, and a
facundious ſuavity. <hi>Agallis Corcyrua</hi> was illuſtrious in the
Art of Grammar, <hi>Caelius</hi> aſcribes unto her the firſt inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the play at Ball. <hi>Leontium</hi> was a Grecian Damoſel,
whom <hi>Gallius</hi> cals a ſtrumpet, ſhe was ſo well ſeen in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophicall
contemplations, that ſhe feared not to write a
worthy book againſt the much worthy <hi>Theophraſtus. Plin.
in Prolog. Nat. Hiſt. Cicero, lib. de Natur. Deorum. Dama</hi> the
daughter of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> imitated the ſteps of her father, as

the ſiſter of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> was ſo practiſed a ſtudient, that
in many of his works (as he himſelfe confeſſeth) he hath

<hi>L. Craſſus,</hi> as the two daughters of <hi>Mutia</hi> inherited the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

inſtructed in womaniſh cares and offices, but as <hi>Volater. lib.
16. Antrop.</hi> reports of her, rather to direct Magiſtracies,

Papinius</hi> was happy in a wife called <hi>Claudia,</hi> excellent
in all manner of learning. <hi>Amalaſuntha</hi> Queen of the

Queen of the Palmirians, who after the death of <hi>Odenatus,</hi>

ſhe was nominated amongſt the thirty Tyrants, and

in battel by the Emperor <hi>Aurelianus,</hi> was led in triumph
through Rome, but by the clemency of that Prince, ſhe was
granted a free Pallace ſcituate by the river of Tyber, where
ſhe moderately and temperately demeaned her ſelfe: ſhe
is reported to be of that chaſtity, that ſhe never enterteined
her husband in the familiar ſociety of her bed, but for iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues
ſake and procreation of children, but not from the time
that ſhe found her conception, till her delivery: ſhe uſed
to be adored after the majeſtick ſtate and reverence done
to the great Sophies of Perſia. Being called to the hearing
of any publick Oration, ſhe ſtill appeared with her head
armed, and her helmet on, in a purple mantle buckled up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en

magnanimous and haughty in all her undertakings, moſt

the tribute due unto Rome, immediately after whoſe

<hi>Coil</hi> who was then King died, therefore the Britains the

King, a young Lady of an attractive beauty, ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

of Buty teſtifies, who in Engliſh heroical verſe compiled
his Hiſtory: <hi>Conſtantius</hi> (ſaith he) the younger ſucceded his
father <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> as wel in the Kingdome of England, as
divers other Provinces, a noble and valiant Prince, whoſe
mother was a woman religious, and of great ſanctimony;
this young Prince was born in Britain and proved ſo
mighty in exploits of war, that in time be purchaſed the
name of <hi>Magnus,</hi> and was ſtiled <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, a
noble protector and defender of the true Chriſtian Faith.
In the ſixt year of his reign he came with a potent Army
againſt <hi>Maxentius,</hi> who with grievous tributes and exacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
then vexed and oppreſſed the Romans: and being upon
his match, he ſaw in a viſion by night, the ſign of the Croſs
in the air like fire, and an Angel by it, thus ſaying, <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,
in hoc ſigno vinces, i. Conſtantine,</hi> in this ſign thou ſhalt
conquer and overcome; with which being greatly comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
he ſoon after invaded and defeated the army of <hi>Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entius,</hi>
who flying from the battel, was wretchedly drowned
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:57230:289"/>
in the river Tiber. In this interim of his glorious victory,
<hi>Helena</hi> the mother of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> being on pilgrimage at
Jeruſalem, there found the Croſſe on which the Saviour of
the world was crucified, with the three nails on which his
hands and feet were pierced. <hi>Ranulphus</hi> amplifies this ſtory
of <hi>Helena,</hi> ſomewhat larger after this manner, That when
<hi>Conſtantine</hi> had ſurprized <hi>Maxentius,</hi> his mother was then
in Brittain, and hearing of the ſucceſſe of ſo brave a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt,
ſhe ſent him a letter, with great thanks to heaven, to
congratulate ſo fair and wiſhed a Fortune; but not yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
truly inſtructed in the Chriſtian Faith, ſhe commended
him that he had forſaken idolatry, but blamed him that he
worſhipped and beleeved in a man that had been nalled to
the Croſs. The Emperor wrote again to his mother, That
ſhe ſhould inſtantly repair to Rome, and bring with her
the moſt learned Jewes and wiſeſt Doctors, of what faith or
beleefe ſoever, to hold diſputation in their preſence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the truth of Religion. <hi>Helena</hi> brough with her to
the number of ſeven ſcore Jewes and others, againſt whom
Saint <hi>Silveſter</hi> was only oppoſed. In this controverſie the
misbeleevers were all nonpluſt and put to ſilence. It hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
that a Jewiſh Cabaliſt among them ſpake certain
words in the ear of a mad wild Bull that was broke looſe
&amp; run into the preſence where they were then aſſembled;
thoſe words were no ſooner uttered, but the beaſt ſunk
down without motion, and inſtantly died; at which acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
the judges that ſate to hear the diſputation, were all
aſtoniſhed, as wondring by what power that was done. To
whom <hi>Silveſter</hi> then ſpake, What this man hath done is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by the power of the devil, who can kil but not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore
unto life, but it is God only that can ſlay and make
the ſame body revive again; ſo Lyons, and other wild beaſts
of the Forreſt can wound and deſtroy, but not make whole
what is before by them periſhed: then (ſaith he) if he will
that I beleeve with him, let him raiſe that beaſt to life in
Gods name, which he hath deſtroied in the devils name.
But the Jewiſh Doctor attempted it in vain, when the reſt
turning to <hi>Silveſter,</hi> ſaid, If thou by any power in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
or Earth canſt call back again the life of this beaſt,
which is now baniſhed from his body, we wil beleeve with
thee in that Deity, by whoſe power ſo great a miracle can
be done. <hi>Silveſter</hi> accepted of their offer, and falling de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly
on his knees, made his praiers unto the Saviour of
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:57230:290"/>
the world, and preſently the beaſt ſtarted up upon his feet;
by which <hi>Conſtantius</hi> was confirmed, <hi>Helena</hi> converted, &amp; al
the Jews and other Pagan Doctors received the Chriſtian
Faith, and were after baptized: and after this, and upon the
ſame occaſion, <hi>Helena</hi> undertook to ſeek and find out the
Croſs. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> and others ſay ſhe was an Inne-keepers
daughter at Treverent in France, and that the firſt <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantius</hi>
travelling that way, married her for her beauty;
but our Hiſtories of Britain affirm her to be the fair, chaſt,
and wiſe daughter of King <hi>Coil,</hi> before remembred. The
perfections of the mind are much above the tranſitory
gifts of Fortune, much commendable in women, and a
dowry far tranſcending the riches of gold &amp; jewels. Great
<hi>Alexander</hi> refuſed the beautiful daughter of <hi>Darius,</hi> who
would have brought with her Kingdomes for her Dower,
and infinite treaſures to boot, and made choice of <hi>Barſine,</hi>
who brought nothing to eſpouſe her with, ſave her feature,
and that ſhe was a ſcholer; and though a Barbarian, excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
perfect in the Greek tongue, who though poor, yet
derived her pedigree from Kings: And upon that ground,
<hi>Lycurgus</hi> inſtituted a Law, That women ſhould have no
Dowers allotted them, that men might rather acquire after
their Vertues, then their Riches, and women likewiſe might
the more laboriouſly imploy themſelves in the attaining to
the height of the beſt and nobleſt Diſciplines. It is an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
that cannot be too much amplified, to encourage
Vertue and diſcourage Vice, to perſwade both men and
women to inſtruct their minds more carefully then they
would adorn their bodies, and ſtrive to heap and accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
the riches of the Soul, rather then hunt after pomp,
Vain glory, and the wretched wealth of the world; the firſt
being everlaſtingly permanent, the laſt, dayly and hourly
ſubject to corruption and mutability. <hi>Horace</hi> in his firſt
Epiſtle to <hi>Mecaenas</hi> ſaith:
<q>Vitius Argentum eſt Auro, virtutibus Aurum.</q>
Silver is more baſe and cheap then Gold, and Gold then Vertue.

ſo that in proceſſe of time, by their ſmooth and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle

reduced them from rudeneſſe to a more formall

inhumane before a deity. They moderated the fero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city

they dealt with them as careful fathers uſe to doe with their
untoward children; when things profitable will not ſtill
them, they ſeek to ſtill them with toies: ſo the Poets, when
wholſome food would not taſte their mouths, they deviſed
ſweet meats to reliſh their pallats, finding out merry and
delightful tales, beſt agreeable with their itching ears:
comprehending notwithſtanding, golden truths in leaden
fables. They after inſtituted good and wholſome lawes,
to incourage the good, and deject the bad; to raiſe the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
and wel diſpoſed to honor, and to puniſh the evil do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
either with pennance or ſhame: then came the indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious
man to be firſt diſtinguiſhed from the ſloathful, and
the thrifty from the prodigal: things were no more made
common, every man eat of his own labor, and what he ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
he might call his own. Hence firſt grew induſtry, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which no Common weal nor publike State can ſtand.
And theſe and much greater were the firſt fruits of Poetry,
now in this age ſo much deſpiſed; the uſe whereof was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,
the apprehenſion divine, the practiſe commendable,
and the name rerevrent. There is a ſympathy and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence

Rhetorician attain to the height of eloquence, unleſſe he
hath firſt laid his foundation in Poetry. They are two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies,
that cannot wel exiſt one without the other:
Poetry is the elder brother, and more plain in his condition:
Rhetorick the younger, but more crafty in his profeſſion:
hence it comes, Poets are ſo poor, and Lawyers ſo rich; for
they have made a younger brother of the elder, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe
all the Land. Beſides, as much as <hi>Apollo</hi> is excellent
above <hi>Mercury,</hi> as being God of Light, of Muſick, of Phyſick,
of Arts, &amp;c. and the other God of Bargaining, Buying,
Selling, of Cozening, Theeving, and of Lies; ſo far doth the
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:57230:292"/>
firſt claim due priority above the ſecond. They may be
thus diſtinguiſhed: Poets in that which outwardly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
fabulous, colour and ſhadow golden truths, to their
own painful ſtudies and labour, and to the pleaſure and
profit of others: But many Orators, under ſeeming truths,
apparel ſcandalous fictions, aimed only at their own be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit,
to the impoveriſhing of others, and many times ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
them out of a fair inheritance: I ſpeak of ſome, not
all; and I honour the Law, becauſe I live under it. Poets,
they were the firſt teachers and inſtructers; the people held
them to be inſpired from above, and to ſpeak as from the
mouths of the gods: ſome were holy, as <hi>Ennius;</hi> ſome Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,
as <hi>Homer;</hi> others Prophets, as having the name of <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi>
conferred upon them: and amongſt theſe, may be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
the <hi>Sybils,</hi> the Prieſts of <hi>Apollo,</hi> and ſuch as belonged
to all the other Oracles. Of the Poets there were many
ſorts, and ſuch as writ in divers kinds, yet all theſe imitated

But it was never found or known, that ever any

It is further obſerved, that all ſuch are for the moſt

that women who by nature have a more ſweet and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Now concerning this Magick, what reputation it hath been
in amongſt men (which in effect is no better then plain
Witchcraft in women) we may read in <hi>Nauclerus</hi> and <hi>Plati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
That all the Popes incluſively from <hi>Silveſter</hi> the ſecond,

ſtabb'd him to the heart, uttering theſe words, See, I am

               <p>THe difference betwixt Witches, or to define what <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gae</hi>
are, and what <hi>Lamiae,</hi> were but time miſpent, the
rather becauſe it hath been an argument ſo much handled
in our mother tongue, I will only rehearſe unto you ſome
few particular diſcourſes concerning Witches, out of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus,
Bodinus, Wierius, Grillaneus Italus,</hi> and others: all agree,
that ſome have made expreſſe covenant with the Devill
by Bond and Indenture, ſealed and delivered; others by
promiſe and oath only: as likewiſe that all ſuch have ſecret
marks about them in ſome private place of their bodies,
ſome in the inſide of the lip, ſome in the haire of the eie-browes,
ſome in the fundament, ſome in the inſide of the
thigh, the hollow of the arm, or the privy parts. <hi>Albertus
Pictus</hi> an Advocate in the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> reported he
had ſeen one in the Caſtle of <hi>Theodoricus,</hi> who had a plain
mark upon the right ſhoulder, which the next day was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

affirmed the like of one <hi>Joanna Hervilleria.</hi> Concerning
the tranſportation of Witches through the air, <hi>Paulus Gril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landus</hi>
an Italian Doctor of the Law, that writ the Hiſtories
of many Witches, ſaith, That a Country Villager not farre
from Rome, upon a night ſpying his wife daub her ſelf with
a certain <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nguent, and inſtantly leap out at the window,
after her ſtay from him ſome three or four hours, had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
againſt her return a good cudgel, with which he ſo
ſoundly enterteined her, that he forced her to confeſſe
where ſhe had been, but would not grant her free pardon
till ſhe had made him promiſe to bring him to the ſight of
all theſe novelties, and unbeleevable paſſages by her rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
the match was concluded, ſhe forewarned him that he
muſt in no wiſe uſe the name of God by the way, unleſſe it
were in ſcorn or blaſphemy, with other ſuch horrible in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions.
The night came, they were both annointed,
when preſently two rough Goats appeared at the window,
upon which they being mounted, were inſtantly hurried
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:57230:307"/>
through the air into a place where were an infinite mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude

one that ſeemed to be Prince and Sovereign of the reſt,
to whom every one of them did obeiſance and adoration,
ſhe bid her husband ſtand in a remote place till ſhe had
likewiſe done her worſhip, which he ſhe accordingly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed:
This done, they all danced together in a circle or

was ended, the tables were covered and furniſhed, ſhe cals
to her husband to ſit down amongſt the reſt, and bids him
welcome, he begins to feed, but finding the meat to have
no reliſh, in regard it was not well ſeaſoned, he cals aloud
for ſalt, and many times before it came, it was brought at
length, which he ſeeing, before he taſted it, he thus ſaid,
<hi>Hor laudato ſui Dio per è venuto queſto ſale, i.</hi> Now God be
thanked that the ſalt is come: theſe words were no ſooner
ſpoken, but Men, Meat, Tables, Devils, Witches, all were
vaniſhed in an inſtant, he was left alone naked, almoſt
frozen with cold, ignorant in what place, or whither to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
for ſhelter; day came, he ſpies ſhepherds, and asks them
where he is? they tell him in the principality of Benevent,
under the juriſdiction of the Pope, above an hundred miles
from Rome. He was forced to beg rags to cover him, and
bread to relieve him, being eight daies before he could
reach to his cottage; he accuſeth his wife, ſhe others, who
were all after delivered to the fire, and burnt alive. The
like hiſtory the ſame Author relates of a young damoſel
inticed by an old Witch to this damnable aſſembly in the
Dutchie of Spoletum, in the year of grace 1535. The like
confeſſion of theſe aſſemblies, dances, and banquets, and
after all, their common carnal ſociety, women with he De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,

Megerus</hi> the accurate writer of the Flanders Hiſtory,
relates that in the year 1459, a great number of men and
women Witches were burned, who publickly confeſſed
their unguents, tranſuections, dances, feaſts, and conſociety
with Devils: ſo likewiſe <hi>Iacobus Sprangerus</hi> of German
Witches, in the Cities and Villages about Conſtantienſis
and Ratisbone, in the year 1485, reports the like. I could
tire the Reader with infinite examples, authors, teſtates, and
adjurors, with the places, times, and circumſtances, one or
two at the moſt ſhal ſuffice. <hi>Ioachimus Cameracenſis</hi> in his
book <hi>de Natura Demonum,</hi> tels us of a traveller that paſſing
by night through a forreſt, hear the like noiſe of muſick,
mirth, dancing, and revels, and approaching neerer to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
the novel, eſpied the like convention, when on the
ſudden the Devils and Witches all vaniſhed, and left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
them certain bowls and cups of plate, with the names
of the owners ingraven upon them, which he took and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
the next day to the Magiſtrates, by which many of the
Witches were known, theſe diſcovered others, all which
were condemned to the ſtake. In the year 1504, <hi>Salvertus</hi>
being Preſident amongſt the Pictavians, where he with

                  <hi>Daventonius</hi> his fellow Preſident ſate as Judges, three men
and one woman were convicted, and after doomed to the
fire, all theſe confeſt the ceremonies in the before named
nightly meetings: as alſo there was a Goat placed in the
middeſt of them, whoſe hinder parts they all kiſt, every one
holding a lighted candle in their hand. At length with
theſe lights the Goat was burned to aſhes, of which every of
them received a quantity This duſt they ſcattered upon the
threſholds of Houſes, Stable doors, Ox-ſtals, or Sheep-coats,
to deſtroy either Children, Horſes, Sheep, or ſuch
Cattel of their enemies. This being diſtributed amongſt
them, the devil cried with a loud voice, <hi>Revenge your ſelves
of your enemies, or die your ſelves.</hi> At the next meeting, every
one was particularly examined of the miſchiefes they had
done; and ſuch as could not give juſt account of ſome or
other ill, were publiquely mocked and derided by the reſt,
and after received ſo many ſtripes as were adjudged her by
the Devil; inſomuch, that one Witch confeſſed ſhe could
never reſt and be at quiet in her own thoughts, unleſſe ſhe
were doing ſome villany or other; and if ſhe had no worſe
work in hand, ſhe muſt break Pots, Glaſſes, pluck out the
Spiggots, and let the Beer run out of the barrels, into the
Cellar floors, to keep her hand in ure. Of the power of Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
and Witchcraft, <hi>Virgil,</hi> who was held not to be the

none more amply then <hi>Ovid,</hi> when he thus writ:

lib.</hi> 20.<note place="margin">A ſtrange Witchcrafte.</note> relates a Hiſtory of two ſuch Witches that lived in
the road way to Rome. A Minſtrel or Piper travelling that
way, taſted of this cheeſe, and was preſently changed into
an Aſſe, who notwithſtanding he had loſt his ſhape, ſtill
retained his naturall reaſon, and (as one <hi>Banks</hi> here about
this City taught his horſe to ſhew tricks, by which he got
much monie) ſo this Aſſe being capable of what was taught
him, and underſtanding what he was bid to do, ſhewed a
thouſand ſeverall pleaſures (almoſt impoſſible to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
by any unreaſonable creature) to all ſuch as
came to ſee him, and paid for the ſight, inſomuch that he
was ſold by theſe Witches to a neighbour of theirs, for a
great ſum of monie, but at the delivery of him ſaith one of
the Witches, Take heed neighbor (if you mean to have
good of your beaſt) that in any caſe you lead him not
through the water: The poor tranſhaped Piper this hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
apprehends, that water might be the means to reſtore
him to his former humane figure, purpoſing in himſelfe to
make proof thereof at his next beſt opportunity. Carefull
was the new Merchant of the charge given, and watered
him ſtill in a pail, but would never let him drink from the
river; but the Maſter travelling by the way, and to eaſe
his beaſt alighting and leading him in his hand: the Aſſe
on the ſudden broke his bridle, ran out of ſight, and leaped
into the next river he came neer, where leaving his ſaddle
and furniture behind, he waded out in his own ſhape: the
man purſues him with all the ſpeed he can, and followes
him the way he took, the firſt he meets is the Piper, and asks
him if he ſaw not ſuch a kind a beaſt, and deſcribes him
to a hair. The fellow acknowledgeth himſelfe to have
been the ſame Aſſe he bought of the Witch; the Maſter
wondreth, and relates this to his Lord, his Lord acquaints
this novell to <hi>Petrus Damianus,</hi> a man of approved know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

digged a pit, and for neceſſity (becauſe it is

and having a pawn ſufficient in her hand, finding it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary

could, a ſhip-broad. The old woman finding her reſolute,
left her with theſe words, Why then (ſaith ſhe) carry it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
if thou canſt. Marry and I will try what I can do, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
ſhe again; and ſo they parted. The Maſter called a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boord,
the wind ſtood fair, the Sea was calm, and the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
pleaſant: but they had not been many hours at ſea,
when there aroſe a ſudden, ſad, and terrible tempeſt, as if
the winds and waters had been at diſſention, and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempered
air at war with both. A mighty ſtorm there aroſe,
inſomuch, that the Maſter proteſted, that in his life time
he had not ſeen the like, and being in deſpair of ſhipwrack,
deſired both ſailers and paſſengers to betake themſelves to
their praiers. This word came from them that laboured a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the hatches, to thoſe that were ſtowed under: their
preſent fear made them truly apprehend the danger, and
betake themſelves to their devotions; when ſuddenly one
caſting up his eies, eſpied an old woman ſitting upon the
top of the main maſt: the Maſter ſaw her, and all thoſe that
were above, being at the ſight much amazed. The rumour
of this went down; which the Gentlewoman heating (who
was then ſitting with her child in her Cabbin, and warming
it over a Charcole fire made in the Kettle) O God ſaith
ſhe (remembring her former words) then the old woman
is come after me for her Kettle; the Maſter apprehending
the buſineſſe, Marry, then let her have it, ſaith he, and takes
the Kettle, coles and all, and caſts them over-boord into
the Sea. This was no ſooner done, but the Witch diſmounts
her ſelfe from the maſt, goes aboord the Braſſe Kettle, and
in a moment ſails out of ſight, the air cleared, the winds
grew calm, the tempeſts ceaſed, and ſhe had a fair and ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
paſſage into England: and this the ſame Gentlewoman
hath often related.<note place="margin">A Witch of Geneva.</note> Nor is this more incredible then that
which in Geneva is is ſtill memorable. A young wench

moſt learned Writers are of opinion, that theſe Inchantreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
can bewitch ſome, but not all, for there are ſuch, over
whom they have no power.<note place="margin">Another kind of Witchcraft.</note> The ſame Author teſtifies, That
he ſaw a Witch of Avern, in the year 1579. who was taken
in Luteria, about whom was found a book of a large Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume,
in which were drawn the hairs of Horſes, Oxen,
Mules, Swine, and other beaſts, of all colours whatſoever:
She (if any beaſts were ſick, would undertake their cure,
by receiving ſome number of their hairs, with which ſhe
made her Spels and Incantations; neither could ſhe help
any beaſt by her own confeſſion, but by transferring that
diſeaſe or malady upon another; neither could ſhe cure
any creature, if ſhe were hired for monie: therefore ſhe
went poorly, in a coat made up with patches. A Noble man
of France ſent to one of theſe Witches, to cure a ſick horſe,
whom he much loved: ſhe returned him anſwer, That of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
his Horſe or his Groom muſt die, and bid him chuſe
whether: The Nobleman craving ſome time of pauſe and
deliberation, the ſervant in the interim died, and the horſe
recovered; for which fact ſhe was apprehended and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
It is a generall obſervation, That the devil (who is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroier)
never heals one creature, but by hurting another,
and commonly he tranſmits his hate from the worſe to the
better. For inſtance, if a Witch cure a horſe, the diſeaſe fals
upon one of a higher price; if ſhe heal the wife, ſhe harms
the husband; if helps the ſon, ſhe infects the father. Of this
I will produce one or two credible inſtances: The firſt, of
the Lord <hi>Furnerius Aurelienſis,</hi> who finding himſelfe mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
(as he thought) diſeaſed, ſent to a Witch to counſell
with her about his recovery, who told him, there was no
hope of his life, unleſſe he would yield that his young ſon
then ſucking at the Nurſes breaſt) ſhould have his mortall
infirmity confirmed upon it. The father to ſave his own
life, yields that his ſon ſhould periſh, of which the Nurſe
hearing, juſt at the hour when the father ſhould be healed,
is abſent, and conceals the child. The father is no ſooner
toucht, but helped of his diſeaſe; the Witch demands for
the child, to transfer it upon him: the child is miſſing, and
cannot be found: which the Witch hearing, broke out into
this exclamation, <hi>Actum eſt, de me, puer ubinam eſt? i.</hi> I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done,
where is the child? when ſcarce having put her foot
over the threſhold to return home, but ſhe fell down ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
dead, her body being blaſted, and as black as an

Witch amongſt the Nanvetae, who was accuſed of bewit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
her neighbor: The Magiſtrates commanded her but
to touch the party diſtempered with her Inchantments
(which is a thing that is uſed by all the German Judges,
even in the Imperiall chamber it ſelfe) The Witch denied
to do it: but ſeeing they began to compell her by force, ſhe
likewiſe cried out, I am then undone; when inſtantly the
ſick woman recovered, and the Witch then in health, fell
down ſuddenly, and died, whoſe body was after condemned
to the fire: And this, <hi>Bodinus</hi> affirms to have heard rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

to whom ſhe anſwered, Oh maſter, maſter, why have you

Maſter growing ſuſpitious, urged her ſo ſtrictly, that ſhe
confeſſed, though her body was there preſent, yet her ſoul
was abroad at the aſſembly of divers Witches, with many
other miſchiefs, for which ſhe was held worthy of death,
and judged. At Burdegall in the year 1571, when there
was a decree made in France, againſt the ſtrict proſecution
of Witches, an old Sorcereſſe of that place, amongſt many
horrid and fearfull things confeſſed by her, ſhe was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed
and impriſoned, where <hi>D. Boletus</hi> viſited her, deſiring
to be eie-witneſſe of ſome of thoſe things before by her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged:
to whom the Witch anſwered, That ſhe had
not power to do any thing in priſon. But deſirous to be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſatisfied concerning ſuch things, he commanded her for
the preſent to be releaſed, and brought out of the Goale to
another lodging, where ſhe in his preſence having annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
her body with a certain unguent, from the crown to the
heel naked, fell into a ſodain apoplex, appearing to them as
dead, deprived of all ſence or motion: but after five hours
returning to her ſelfe, as if ſhe awaked out of a dream, ſhe
related many things done neer and far off in that interim;
of which ſending to know the truth, they found her to erre
in nothing: This was confirmed to <hi>Codinus</hi> by an Earl of
great honour, who was then preſent when this thing was
done, <hi>Olaus Magnus</hi> in his Hiſtory, ſaith, That thoſe things
are common in the Northern parts of the world, and that
the friends of thoſe Extaſis diligently keep and ſafeguard
their bodies whilſt their ſpirits are abroad, either to carry
rings, tokens, or letters, to their friends, though never ſo
far off, and bring them anſwers back again, with infallible
tokens of their being there. Many I could here produce to
the like purpoſe, I will end with Saint <hi>Auguſtine, lib. de Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate

that when his ſpirit hath returned to him again, he hath
conſtantly affirmed that he hath been changed into an

the Vertuous. Then ſince beſides the Shame or Honour in
this life, the one is puniſhed, and the other glorified in the

both helping into the world ripe, timely, and fruitful iſſues.

a third from the Earth, which is called Voice, or diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhable

Rythme, and Number; Harmony proceeding from
the air; Number from the Sea, bounded within his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs,

this diſtemperature. Aſhamed he was to court his ſiſter,
firſt, becauſe he knew her modeſt; a ſecond impediment
was, ſhe was elſewhere diſpoſed and contracted to a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
of a Noble family: beſides, ſhe was his ſiſter; to
whom he wiſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

could deviſe for her no greater ill: he conſidered that to
perſwade her to her own undoing, would ſhew ill in a
ſtranger, but worſe in a brother. In theſe diſtractions,
what ſhould he do, or what courſe take? the thing he appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
was prepoſterous, and the means to compaſs it was
prodigious; for he came to his mother, told her his diſeaſe,
and beſought her of remedy: his words as they were utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with tear, ſo they were heard with trembling, for they
foavered her all over. Being in to the knees, he cared not
now to wade up to the chin, and proceeded, That if ſhe
would not be the means for him to compaſſe his ſiſter, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
all obſtacles whatſoever, he would by ſpeedy
and ſudden death rid himſelfe out of all his miſeries, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
her ſpeedy anſwer, or with his naked poniard in his
hand, he was as ready for execution, as ſhe to deny her aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.
I leave to any mothers conſideration but to imagine
with what ſtrange ambiguities, his words perplexed her,
&amp; what convulſions it bred in her boſome, even to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſtretching of her heart ſtrings: but as ſhe knew his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
to dare, ſo ſhe feared his reſolution to act, therefore
more like a tender hearted mother, then a vertuous mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
matron, rather deſiring to have wicked children, then
none at all, ſhe promiſed him hope, and aſſured him help,
and after ſome perſwaſive words of comfort, left him indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently
ſatisfied. What language the mother uſed to the
daughter to invite her to the pollution of her body, and
deſtruction of her ſoul, is not in me to conceive: I only
come to the point, by the mothers mediation the brother is
brought to the bed of his ſiſter, ſhe is viti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

glutted, yet not ſo, but that they continued their
<pb n="602" facs="tcp:57230:325"/>
private meetings, inſomuch that cuſtome bred impudence,
and ſuſpition certain proof of their inceſtuous conſociety:
At length it comes to the ear of him that had contracted
her, with atteſtation of the truth thereof: he, though he
feared the greatneſſe of <hi>Leucippus</hi> his known valour, and
popular favour, yet his ſpirit could not brook ſo unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
an injury; he acquaints this novell to his father, and
certain noble friends of his, amongſt whom it was conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by all jointly, to inform <hi>Xanthius</hi> of his daughters in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſtity:
but for their own ſafety (knowing the potency of
<hi>Leucippus)</hi> to conceal the name of the adulterer. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
to him, and inform him of the buſineſſe, intreating his
ſecrecy, till he be himſelf eie-witneſs of his daughters diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor.
The father at this newes is inraged, but arms himſelfe
with patience, much longing to know that libidinous
wretch who had diſhonored his family. The inceſtuous
meeting was watcht and diſcovered, and word brought to
<hi>Xanthius</hi> that now was the time to apprehend them; he cals
for lights, and attended with her accuſers, purpoſes to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade
the chamber: great noiſe is made, ſhe affrighted
riſes, and before they came to the door, opens it, ſlips by,
thinking to flie and hide her ſelfe; the father ſuppoſing her
to be the adulterer, purſues her, and pierceth her through
with his ſword. By this <hi>Leucippus</hi> ſtarts up, and with his
ſword in his hand, hearing her laſt dying ſhreek, prepares
himſelf for her reſcue, he is incountred by his father, whom
in the diſtraction of the ſudden affright, he unadviſedly
aſſaulted and ſlew. The mother diſturbed with the noiſe,
haſts to the place where ſhe heard the tumult was, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her husband and daughter ſlain, betwixt the horridneſs
of the ſight, and apprehenſion of her own guilt, fell down
ſuddenly and expired. And theſe are the lamentable effects
of Inceſt, the father to kill his own daughter, the ſon his
father, and the mother (the cauſe of all ill) to die ſuddenly
without the leaſt thought of repentance. Theſe things ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately
hapning, <hi>Leucippus</hi> cauſed their bodies to be
nobly interred, when forſaking his fathers houſe in Theſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
he made an expedition into Creet, but being repulſt
from thence by the inhabitants, he made for Epheſia, where
he took perforce a City in the province of Cretinaea, and
after inhabited it. It is ſaid that <hi>Leucophria</hi> the daughter of

into his hands, who after married her, and was ruler thereof.

be ſtoned to death; which puniſhment the Hebrews held to

               <p>The ſecond thing is, That having renounced God and

unto him, but invoke and call upon him.</p>
               <p>A fourth thing is (which many have confeſſed) That they
have vowed their children to the Devil;<note place="margin">Levit. 21.</note> now the Law ſaith,

               <p>A fifth thing is (gathered out of their own confeſſions)
That they have ſacrificed Infants not yet baptized, to the
Devill, and have kill'd them by thruſting great pins into
their heads. <hi>Sprangerus</hi> teſtifies, that he condemned one to
the fire, who confeſſed, that ſhe by ſuch means had been the
death of one and forty children.</p>
               <p>A ſixth thing is, That they do not only offer children in

ſpeaks, That for that ſin alone God will extirp and root out
the people) but they vow them in the womb.<note place="margin">Deut. 18.</note>
               </p>
               <p>A ſeventh is, That they are not themſelves blaſphemers

this ſhee-goat from that, and which heifer or the

her; and if I transfer mine eies upon a ſecond, though I
be refreſht, yet I am not benefited; and if upon a third, I
am cloied with variety, not diſparaging any, but ſtill ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauding

the other are <hi>Minerva</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> his two daughters, ſo that
of neceſſity in gaining one uncertain friend, I ſhall pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe

The Beauty of a woman is eſpecially ſeen in the face, by
which we may conjecture the excellency of the other hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
lineaments of the body; and therein is many times the
pulchritude of the mind illuſtrated, as in the baſhful eie,
modeſt look, and ſhamefaced countenance; therefore doth
the face deſervedly challenge the firſt ſeat of Beauty, the
Head being the nobleſt part of the body, the Will, the
Mind, the Memory, the Underſtanding have their place
and reſidence, where they exerciſe their divers effects and
qualities, therefore though they be in the other parts of the
body excellently featured, though they be Wiſe, Learned,
irreprovable in Life and converſation, unblemiſhed in their
<pb n="639" facs="tcp:57230:345"/>
reputation, and every way laudable, yet the face is the firſt
thing contemplated, as noble above the reſt, and from
which all other excellencies are approved; for when all
the reſt are masked and hidden, that only is continually
viſible, and laid open: and that may be the reaſon why moſt
women that are not born fair, attempt with artificiall beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

at his elbow, to whom he ſaid, Hold, take this bowl, and bear
it to the Poet <hi>Euripides,</hi> and tell him, I beſtow it on him as

In which he nothing abated of his Kingly bounty, only he

offered it ſelfe to him, and called for a cup of Beer, ſeating
himſelf in the firſt room next to the ſtreet. He had not well
wiped the ſweat from his face with his handkerchiefe, but
two or three young wenches came skittiſhly in and out
the room; who ſeeing him to be a man of faſhion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
likely to be of means, they thought to make of him
ſome booty, being (it ſeems) ſet on by the Grandam of the
houſe, for as it proved, it was a common Brothel houſe. The
youngeſt and handſomeſt amongſt the reſt was put upon
him: who entreated him, not to be ſeen below, where every
Porter, Carman, and common fellow came to drink, but to
take a more convenient and retired room. The Gentleman
ſuſpecting the place (as it was indeed) to be no better then
it ſhould be, and being willing to ſee ſome faſhions, took
her gentle proffer, and went with her up the ſtairs: where
they two being alone (and a bed in the room) beer being
brought up, ſhe began to offer him more then common
courteſie, being ſo far from modeſty, that ſhe almoſt proſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
her ſelfe unto him. Which he apprehending, asked
her in plain terms, If theſe were not meer provocations to
incite him to luſt? which ſhe as plainly confeſſed. To whom
he replied, That ſince it was ſo, he was moſt willing to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of her kind proffer; only for modeſty ſake, he deſired
her to ſhew him into a darker room. To which ſhe aſsented,
and leads him from one place to another; but he ſtill told

ſhe began at length ſomewhat to diſtaſte him, becauſe in all
<pb n="642" facs="tcp:57230:347"/>
that time he had not made unto her any friendly proffer.
At length ſhe brought him into a cloſe narrow room, with

there was a civil maid (a kinſwoman of his, lately come out

courteſie to him. Briefly, the motion was accepted, ſhe ſent

her tender love and diligence about the children, won her

a widower, and the charge of the whole houſe committed to

Which ſhe executed with ſuch fidelity, that he caſting a

contracted himſelfe unto her, and they were ſoon after

this young woman, the Gentleman that brought her this
fortune, adventured all his means upon a voiage, which
miſcarried (for the ſhip wherein he ſailed, was taken by the
Spaniard, and he almoſt a twelve month kept priſoner in

ſtood. The next morning (by her appointment) came a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
very early to his lodging (ſhe having taught him

firſt asked him his name, which (though loth) he told him:

Gentleman ſhould grone beneath ſo great a burden, told
him there was a hundred pounds, bad him furniſh himſelf
with apparell and other neceſsaries, and ſo was ready to
take his leave. The other extaſi'd with ſo great a courteſie
from a ſtranger, whom he had not ſeen before, enforced him
back, to know what reaſon he had to be ſo charitable, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating
him to conſider what hope he had to be ſo charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
entreating him to conſider what hope he had of future
ſatisfaction, or at leaſt to reſolve him what ſecurity he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.
The other anſwered, That for the firſt, his cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie
was grounded upon his worth; his ſatisfaction was in
his acknowledgement; and his ſecurity, in that he knew him
honeſt, and told him, ſome three daies after he would call
upon him, when he was habited like himſelfe, to entreat his
further acquaintance, and ſo preſently left him. But trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
in his mind above wonder, to receive ſuch bounty from
a man unknown, when all his kindred and familiar friends,
were aſhamed of his acquaintance; yet took the benefit of
the preſent occaſion, and ſuited himſelfe according to his

In the mean time the late widow had provided a great
Feaſt, whither ſhe had envited all her ſuit as (who were not

demanded of his friend, If it were not ſuch a woman? who
briefly told him all: How ſhe came a ſtranger to the houſe,

(and himſelfe amongſt the reſt) were ſuitors, and that their
hope was, this day ſhe would make choiſe of a husband.
Whatſoever he thought, he ſaid nothing for the preſent. The
