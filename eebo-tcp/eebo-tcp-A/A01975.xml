         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The meanes whereby wee <hi>men on earth</hi> haue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
to <hi>God in Heauen,</hi> is Prayer. By Prayer we enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the <hi>Court</hi> where God ſitteth in his Maieſtie, and wee
preſent out ſelues before him ſpeaking vnto him as it
were face to face. That therefore which inſtructeth vs to
pray aright, directeth vs to God. This doth the <hi>Lords
Prayer:</hi> And nothing can doe it better. For this end, <hi>To
teach vs how to pray,</hi> it was firſt preſcribed. It is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a moſt abſolute prayer in it ſelfe, but alſo a perfect pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne
for other prayers. And in this reſpect the only way
wherein we can goe to God. Full of matter is this forme
of Prayer, but few the words thereof. Such fulneſſe of
matter in ſo few words make it to many as the propheſie
of Chriſt was to <hi>Candaces</hi> Eunuch, whereof he ſaid (to
him that moued this queſtion, <hi>Vnderstandeſt thou what
thou readeſt?) How can I except I had a guide? A guide</hi>
therefore is needfull for many to direct them in this way
<hi>to goe to God.</hi> Loe a <hi>Guide</hi> at hand. This <hi>Explanation of
the Lords Prayer is offered</hi> to you for that purpoſe. But as
a <hi>Guide</hi> that directeth a Traueller in his iourney to the
Kings Court, maketh not the way better, but ſheweth
him how to order his trauell in that way: ſo this <hi>Guide,</hi>
this <hi>Explanation,</hi> addeth nothing to the Perfection of the
Prayer, but onely helpeth you in the vſe thereof. The
many particulars which miniſter iuſt matter of ardent
ſupplication, hearty gratulation, deepe humiliation, and
conſcionable obſeruation of our wayes, are in this <hi>Expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi>
diſtinctly ſet out. Thereby you may ſee how rich a
Cabonet the <hi>Lords Prayer</hi> is: how full of moſt precious
<pb facs="tcp:3438:3"/>
iewels, vſefull for the ſoule of man. The <hi>Excellencie</hi> of this
forme of Prayer is ſet forth in the firſt Section of this
<hi>Explanation.</hi> Whatſoeuer is therein performed is the
fruit of my affected <hi>Retiredneſſe,</hi> and ſuſpected <hi>Idleneſſe</hi>
in the countrey. So many, ſo continuall are my imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

a few weekes abſence in the yeare from my charge (there

Prayer commended in the Scripture, or at any time by any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

to begin Prayer, in what order to ſet euery Petition that wee
make, and how to conclude our Prayer.</p>
               <p>The order therein is as admirable as any other point.<note place="margin">4. The order obſerued in it.</note> Though
the things compriſed in it are innumerable, yet are they all

               <p>In a word,<note place="margin">The perfection of it.</note> nothing any way pertinent vnto Prayer is omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

and a <hi>Canonicall</hi> Prayer. <hi>Catholicall,</hi> in that it compriſeth
the ſubſtance of all warrantable Prayers in it. <hi>Canonicall,</hi> in that
it is the Canon or Rule to ſquare and frame all prayers by it.</p>
               <p>Is not this then a fit ſubiect for the greateſt that be,<note place="margin">Too much paines cannot be taken about it.</note> in dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,

taken to open and diſcouer the rich treaſure contained
therein?</p>
               <p>Are not they vngratefull to the Author of it, and iniurious to
themſelues, who lightly eſteeme it?</p>
               <p>What may we thinke of Papiſts that ſuffer not the vulgar
people to learne it in their owne mother tongue?<note place="margin">Papiſts abuſe it.</note> Indeed they
ſuffer, yea and enioyne them to tumble it vp and downe, and to
mumble it againe and againe, as it were by tale vpon their beads
in an vnknowne tongue, whereby they make it a matter of
meere babling.</p>
               <p>What alſo may we thinke of Anabaptiſts and ſuch like Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matickes
as forbid people to vſe it at all?<note place="margin">Anabaptiſts vſe it not.</note> Of all prayers this
without all contradiction is the moſt perfect, ſo as if any forme
at all may be vſed, then this moſt of all.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It will not thence follow, that it is not to be vſed at
all. Many of thoſe Petitions which Chriſtians in their owne
forme of Prayer do make, imply more matter, then in the time
of vttering them they are able to conceiue. Who can compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
the infiniteneſſe of Gods glorie? May we not therefore
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:3438:10"/>
pray as Chriſt did,<note place="margin">Iohn 12. 28.</note> 
                  <hi>Father glorifie thy name? Who can vnderſtand
his faults?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 19. 12.</note> Shall not a ſinner therefore aske pardon for all his
ſinnes?</p>
               <p>Who can in the time that <hi>Amen</hi> may be vttered, thinke of
euery particular point, that in a long Prayer hath bene mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by way of Petition or Thankſgiuing? May not therefore
<hi>Amen</hi> be ſaid at the end of our owne or anothers Prayer, if it
haue bene long?</p>
               <p>Aſſuredly, a generall apprehenſion of more particulars then
can be diſtinctly conceiued at once, is acceptable to God: or
elſe many approued Prayers recorded in Scripture were not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable.
No man can in particular expreſſe all things that are
needfull and meete to be mentioned in Prayer: it is therefore
very requiſite that after we haue particularly and expreſly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in our Prayer, ſuch things as we conceiue to be moſt
needfull and behoouefull, we ſhould vſe ſome ſuch generall
words and phraſes, as may include all other needfull and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoouefull
things. In which reſpect the common cuſtome of
concluding our owne Prayers, with this perfect forme of Prayer
preſcribed by the Lord, is very commendable.</p>

§. 4. and of other like Prayers in Scripture, and ye ſhall find
thoſe two properties of old vſually ioyned together. The hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then

extremes, the gulfe of <hi>despaire,</hi> and the rocke of <hi>preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi>
by either of which Prayer is made altogether, fruitleſſe.
For God turneth not to the <hi>doubting mind,</hi>

               <p>6. The <hi>failings</hi> for which we are to be humbled.</p>
               <p>The three former of theſe are moſt proper and naturall.
For</p>
               <p>1. By opening the meaning of the words, the true and full in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of Chriſt will be better found out.</p>
               <p>2. By noting out the dependance, one point will giue much
light to another. For the order is very acurate.</p>
               <p>3. By reckoning vp the particulars which are to be craued,
we may eaſily diſcerne what abundance of matter is couched
vnder a few words.</p>
               <p>The other three points follow by iuſt conſequence. For</p>
               <p>1. Whatſoeuer we pray for, when we haue obtained it, we
muſt be thankfull for.</p>
               <p>2. We muſt do what we can to get what we pray for, or elſe
we mocke God.</p>

               <p>It is attributed ſometimes to things that are to be made ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and ſometimes to things that are alreadie holy in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.</p>
               <p>Things to be made holy are hallowed two waies.</p>
               <p>1. By ſetting them apart, or imploying them to an holy vſe.
This may be done by one creature to another. For thus God
commandeth <hi>Moſes</hi> to <hi>ſanctifie</hi> or <hi>hallow all the firſt-borne.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 13. 2, 12.</note> And
to ſhew his meaning herein, he ſaith a little after, <hi>Thou ſhalt ſet
apart vnto the Lord all that openeth the matrix.</hi> Thus do miniſters
hallow the bread and wine at the holy Communion.</p>
               <p>2. By putting holineſſe actually and properly into that which
is hallowed. This the Creator onely can do to his creatures.
The Apoſtle therefore thus prayeth,<note place="margin">1. Theſ. 5. 23.</note>

prerogatiue which God in heauen vouchſafeth to men on earth,

deſire of hallowing Gods name. To this end is a like Preface
prefixed before the Decalogue. In that Preface are laid downe
the fauours of God to his people, and thereupon obedience to
all Gods commandements (whereby God is much honoured)
is required. This dutie of honouring God, vpon the forenamed

which he aimes at we alſo muſt ſet before vs. As for this end, it
is the higheſt, chiefeſt and beſt end whereunto any thing can be
referred. It is the end of this firſt Petition, &amp; of all the reſt: for
the perfection of Gods kingdome, and ſubiection to his will
tende directly to his glorie. As for the other three Petitions,
though in the <hi>matter</hi> of them they concern <hi>our good,</hi> yet in the
<hi>manner</hi> of ſeeking our good, namely of God, they make to <hi>Gods
glorie.</hi> For in the fourth Petition Gods <hi>prouidence</hi> in the things

In oppoſition betwixt diuerſe religions, marke which
cometh neareſt to this marke, nnd moſt tendeth to this end. If
the religions of Proteſtants and of Papiſts be well touched with
this touch-ſtone, and equally poiſed in theſe ballances, it will
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:3438:28"/>
eaſily be found that the reformed Religion is much more ſound
then the other. For one maine difference betwixt vs and them
in all our controuerſies, is this, that we take away from man all
manner of glorying in himſelfe, and giue the glorie of all to
God. But they rob God to giue to man matter of truſting vnto
himſelfe, and vnto others like himſelfe, and of boaſting in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
and others. Inſtance the controuerſies we haue with them
about <hi>the authoritie of the Church aboue the Scriptures, The power
of Popes and Prieſts, Adoration and Inuocation of Angels and
Saints, Their interceſſion, The inherent vertue of Sacramtes, Mans
free-will to good, Workes of ſatisfaction and ſupererogation, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit

theſe.</p>
               <p>This alſo may ſerue as a touch-ſtone to try particular acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
The more they aime at this end the better they be. Though
a worke ſeeme otherwiſe neuer ſo good, yet if Gods glorie be
not the end of it, it onely ſeemeth to be good, as that which
ſeemeth to be what it is not. To giue almes, to pray, to faſt, are
workes in the generall matter and ſubſtance of them good, yet
in theſe Chriſt cenſured the Phariſes,<note place="margin">Math. 6. 1. &amp;c.</note> and warned his Diſciples
not to be like them: and that becauſe they miſſed of this end.
Let vs therefore in all things aime eſpecially at Gods glorie.</p>

               <p>This condition of the Church, to be a kingdome (if the King,

               </p>
               <p>This is that true and proper vſe which wee are to make of

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Euery one ought according to the eſtate

in himſelfe, and in others alſo. For which end theſe particulars
following are carefully to be obſerued.</p>
               <p>1. They who are out of the Church muſt come into it. If
they be in the kingdome of darkneſſe, they muſt not abide
therein. This is eſpecially to be obſerued of them to whom the
light of the Goſpell appeareth, and diſcouereth their darkneſſe.

               <p>Q. How doth God will a thing?</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> 1.<note n="a" place="margin">Epheſ. 1. 11.</note> By ordaining and deternining it.</p>
               <p>2.<note n="b" place="margin">Rom. 12. 2.</note> By liking and approuing it.</p>

               <p>2. Gods reuealed Word is that rule which wee muſt lay

before vs,<note place="margin">Non vbiquè ſicut poteſtas, ſic vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntas eius bona, &amp; beneplacita, &amp; perſecta. Ber. de verb. Eſa. Serm. 5.</note> and the marke whereat wee ought to haue an eye in
all things. Pſal. 119. 9.</p>
               <p>3. This will of God may be reſiſted, and is much reſiſted,

as we need not pray that it may be done.</p>
               <p>3. A deſire may bee made contrarie to Gods ſecret will
without ſinne. Inſtance the deſire of <hi>Dauid</hi> to build a temple
for the Lord: which deſire both <hi>Nathan</hi> the Prophet of the

                  <hi>Q.</hi> VVHat doth the mention of others beſides our ſelues, in
this Petition for temporall bleſſings, teach <hi>v s?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>We muſt as truly deſire the outward wel-fare of
others,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ier. 29. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>as our owne.</hi> This precept of the Prophet, <hi>Seeke the peace
of the Citie, and pray vnto the Lord for it,</hi> is very pertinent to this
purpoſe. For by <hi>peace</hi> he meaneth eſpecially outward proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
So doth the Pſalmiſt,<note place="margin">Pſal. 122. 6.</note> where he ſaith, <hi>Pray for the peace of
Ieruſalem:</hi> for he addeth, <hi>Peace be within thy walles, and proſperitie
within thy palaces.</hi> This might eaſily be exemplified by a particul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar
enumeration of all thoſe temporall bleſſings which we may
pray for in our owne behalfe, applyed to prayers for
others.</p>
               <p>Others are of the ſame mould whereof we are, and ſubiect
to the ſame infirmities: they are ſupported and ſuſtained by the
ſame meanes that we are: and they ſtand in need of temporall
bleſſings as well as we. Theſe therefore muſt be prayed for in
their behalfe.</p>
               <p>This is the rather to be noted, becauſe many who can be well
content to pray for others ſpirituall wel-fare, faile exceedingly
in praying for their temporall wel-fare: which ariſeth from too
much loue of themſelues, and of this world. Men ordinarily are
ſo addicted to this world, as, if it were poſſible, they would
wholly haue it to themſelues. They deſire not therefore to haue
it much communicated to others. As for grace they obſerue it
to be as communicable as light. No man hath the loſſe by the
abundance of another. It rather encreaſeth by communication
and participation. They care not therefore how much others
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:3438:67"/>
haue thereof. But the things of this world are of another na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
The more of them is giuen to ſome, the leſſe remaineth
for others. This maketh many the leſſe forward to pray for the
temporall eſtate of others. Let theſe two peſtiferous rootes,
<hi>Loue of our ſelues,</hi> and <hi>loue of this world</hi> be rooted out of our
hearts, and the forenamed dutie of praying for the temporall
wel-fare of others will be much more readily, and heartily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
               <p>From hence by neceſſarie and iuſt conſequence it followeth,<note place="margin">Others to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued with the bread that wee haue.</note>
that we ought to ſuccour one another with the goods of this
world, according to the rule of loue, which is, our brothers ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie,
and our owne abilitie. For what we pray for in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe
of others, wee muſt to our power endeauour to do for
them. This is alſo the rather to be noted, becauſe many who
are readie to miniſter ſpirituall comfort to others, as to inſtruct
them, to encourage them, to ſtrengthen them in grace and
godlineſſe, and by Chriſtian reproofe to pull them out of the
way of perdition, yea and to exhort others to be mercifull and
bountifull in diſtributing to the poore, are very backwards
themſelues to giue of the goods of this world which they haue,<note place="margin">Iam. 1. 26, 27. &amp; 2. 14. &amp;c.</note>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> VVHy is this Petition for temporall bleſſings ſet before the
Petitions for ſpirituall bleſſings?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Many good and weightie reaſons may
be giuen of this order, which will plainly ſhew that the placing
of this Petition before the two following is no ſufficient argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to proue that by BREAD Chriſt is here meant. Some of
them are theſe.</p>
               <p>1. This is an expreſſe <hi>Petition for good,</hi> as the three former
are: but the two laſt are <hi>deprecations from euill.</hi> It was therefore
requiſite that all the good things to be craued ſhould be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
before the euils againſt which we pray.</p>
               <p>2. The Lord by placing temporall bleſſings, whereof we are
more ſenſible, before ſpirituall, doth endeauour by degrees to
raiſe vp in vs a deſire of ſpirituall bleſſings: which though they
be more needfull,<note place="margin">Ioh. 4. 53.</note> are leſſe ſenſible. The <hi>Ruler</hi> whoſe ſonne
Chriſt healed, was thereby brought to beleeue in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>3. This Petition, being of leaſt conſequence, is moſt fitly put
in the middlemoſt place. For as matters of greateſt weight are
firſt mentioned to ſtirre vp ardencie, euen in the beginning of
prayer: ſo other things of much moment are reſerued to the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:3438:69"/>
latter places to quicken the ſpirit, and to reuiue ardencie, euen
in the ending of prayer. This method do the beſt Orators vſe in
their Orations. Thus Chriſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> beginning this prayer with the
chiefeſt good thing of all, the glorie of Gods name, endeth it
with the beſt good things concerning men, which is his ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
good.</p>
               <p>4. Though temporall bleſſings be not in their kind better
then ſpirituall, yet is man more hardly brought to depend on
God for temporall, then for ſpirituall things. Witneſſe this
prouerbiall ſpeech, <hi>God take care for my ſoule, and I will take care
for my bodie.</hi> Witneſſe alſo that diſtruſtfulneſſe for outward
eſtate, which is in many Saints that ſtedfaſtly truſt in God for
pardon of ſinne, and ſufficient grace to bring them to eternall
life. In this reſpect our faith in God for things of this life, hath
a preheminence and precedence before faith in God for the
things of a better life.</p>
               <p>5. The things craued in the two laſt Petitions are to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in this life. In this life if pardon of ſinne, and freedome
from Satans power be not had, they can neuer be had. He that
dieth with the burden of ſinne lying on his ſoule ſhall neuer be
eaſed of it in the world to come. This life then being preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
for obtaining pardon of ſinne, and deliuerance from euill,
it is meete that it be firſt prayed for.</p>

of themſelues in their owne nature not worthy of damnation.
In their ſence, theſe two termes, <hi>Sinne, Veniall,</hi> are contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictorie,

<hi>worthy of damnation. V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <note place="margin">Rom. 6. 23.</note> To ſay therefore that <hi>ſinne is veniall,</hi> is
to ſay that <hi>worthy of damnation, is not worthy of damnation.</hi> But
I demand, are their <hi>veniall</hi> ſins pleaſing or diſpleaſing to God?
one of them they muſt be. A meane cannot bee giuen betwixt
theſe two contradictorie termes, which is neither of them. They
dare not ſay that veniall ſinnes are pleaſing to God. Then doe
they diſpleaſe him. If they diſpleaſe him they offend an infinite
goodneſſe, an infinite excellency, an infinite Maieſtie, and in
that reſpect are worthy of an infinite puniſhment.</p>
               <p>As for their owne inſtances of <hi>veniall</hi> ſinnes:</p>
               <p>1. The ſuddenneſt motions that can be, though no conſent

Beſides, the perfect Law of God is ſpirituall. It
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:3438:82"/>
requireth integritie in the innermoſt parts, euen in the ſpirits
of men The fore-mentioned thoughts are againſt ſpirituall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegritie:
and in that reſpect againſt the Law: and deſerue the
curſe thereof. Yea further the ſecreteſt &amp; ſuddenneſt thoughts,
are acts and motions of the ſoule: as manifeſt to God as out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
actions of the body. If therefore they be euill, they are in
his ſight apparant tranſgreſſions. As for motions to luſt, though
neuer ſo ſudden at the very ſight of a woman,<note place="margin">Math. 5. 22, 28.</note> Chriſt accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
them a kinde of adulterie. And motions to anger hee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counteth
a kinde of murther. But Adulterie and Murther are
againſt the Law, and deſerue the curſe of the Law.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Of idle words,</hi> Chriſt ſaith,<note place="margin">Math. 12. 36.</note> 
                  <hi>Men ſhall giue account at the
Day of Iudgement.</hi> When the account is taken, ſhall idle words
at the barre of that Iudgement be approued, or condemned?
To ſay they ſhall be approued, were much to impeach the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of Chriſts purity and iuſtice If then they be condemned,
eternall death is their due. There is then no other penalty to be
inflicted. All ſtanding at that Barre, are pronounced <hi>bleſſed,</hi> or
denounced <hi>curſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. For ſtealth of an halfe-penny, doth the Law which ſaith,
<hi>Thou ſhalt not ſteale,</hi> exclude halfe-pennies or no? If no, where is
the exception. The words are indefinite, <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſteale.</hi>
He that ſtealeth an halfe-penny, ſtealeth. In ſtealing an halfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peny
therefore he is a tranſgreſſor of the Law, and guilty of the
penalty and curſe thereof.</p>
               <p>To conclude, <hi>God ſhall bring euery worke into iudgement,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccl. 12. 14.</note>

ought againſt him, he doth not truly forgiue him, but onely to
teeth outward, as we ſpeake. But Gods forgiuing is as true, full,

any ſatisfaction.<note n="f" place="margin">Pſal. 143. 2.</note> Such are we in regard of that debt which
we owe to God. No ſatisfaction therefore is exacted of vs in
our owne perſon.</p>
               <p>2. When his Sonne, who forgiueth, maketh the ſatisfaction.
Such a Suretie haue wee, who hath made ſatisfaction for our
ſinnes: euen<note n="g" place="margin">Ioh. 3. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>the onely begotten Sonne of God,</hi> who is true God. So

               </p>
               <p>3. When hee who forgiueth, is no further bound to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept

Freely hee imputeth what his Sonne did and ſuffered, to vs.
Freely he accepteth vs in his Sonne. Freely he acquitteth our

implying thereby that neither of theſe croſſe the other, but
that all of them may and do ſtand together. Chriſts ſatisfaction
is ſo farre from impeaching the freeneſſe of Gods grace, as it
doth the more commend the ſame. For it is much more grace,
and farre greater mercie in God, not to ſpare his onely begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

prerogatiue without any ſatisfaction at all to forgiue ſinners.
Chriſt, the Sonne of Gods loue, is more highly eſteemed of
God then any ſatisfaction can be. But by the ſatisfaction which
the Sonne of God hath made, there is manifeſted a perfect

               <p>2. Chriſt giueth the vertue of ſatisfaction to mens workes.</p>

but temporall.</p>
               <p>To theſe I briefely anſwer, that</p>
               <p>1. Though the worke of the Spirit bee pure in it ſelfe, yet

not all fulneſſe and perfection at the firſt, but <hi>in part,</hi> by
degrees.</p>
               <p>2. For Chriſt to giue the vertue of ſatisfaction to mens
workes, is to make men Prieſts, and Sauiours: which offices
are his glory.<note place="margin">Iſa. 42. 8.</note> But <hi>he will not giue his glory to others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. The fault being diſcharged by Chriſt, the puniſhment is
alſo thereby diſcharged.<note place="margin">Sublata cauſa tollitur effectus.</note> For the fault is the cauſe of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Take away the cauſe, the effect followeth and falleth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.

not ſo much to make our ſinnes knowne to God (For hee

aduantage from the delinquents confeſſion, according to the

taketh occaſion to ſhew mercy. In relation to God, this

               <p>The application of this point concerneth not onely ſuch as
(through ignorance of that fearefull eſtate wherein they lie by

ſuch, as through ſome violent temptation, and deepe apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of Gods indignation againſt them, are afraid to pray for
pardon of their owne ſinnes, and yet can heartily pray for the
pardon of others ſinnes. Theſe muſt bee well inſtructed in this

which God hath to the particular prayer which is made by a

till a mans ſinnes be pardoned, hee cannot expect any bleſſing

               <p>Many among vs,<note place="margin">Mans pronenes to reuenge.</note> that are taught better diuinitie, do too
much nouriſh this corruption of nature. If they be wronged by
word or deed, they thinke it diſhonourable to put it vp, or
paſſe it ouer without reuenge: which is the cauſe of ſo many
chalenges as from time to time are giuen and taken: and of the
many mortall monomachies, and deſperate duells which are
daily vndertaken: yea and of many ſecret plots and practiſes
for doing ſome notorious miſchiefe, and for taking away the
very life of ſuch as haue done them wrong. If ſuch as are able
with better diſcretion, and more moderation to temper their
outward actions, well obſerue, and throughly trie their inward
diſpoſition, they ſhall find this ſprout of corrupt nature, <hi>reuenge,</hi>
too deepely fixed in them: yea they ſhall find many bitter
fruites thence ſprouting, in reuengefull thoughts and deſires,
wiſhing many miſchiefes to fall vpon them by whom they
thinke themſelues any way wronged. What is this but inward
reuenge? Surely <hi>reuenge</hi> is one of the moſt incurable ſores of
the fleſh. It is moſt hardly ſubdued and mortified. A good
ſigne therefore of renewed nature it is to forbeare reuenge and
forgiue wrongs: if at leaſt it be done in truth, from the heart, for
the conſcience ſake.</p>

great glory that they can ſay, <hi>I runne into no mans debt, I doe

               </p>

wherein God himſelfe glorieth, that<note n="a" place="margin">Exod. 34. 7.</note>

                  <hi>Much euery way.</hi> Thereby aſſurance of Gods for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing

the better loued of them, and receiue more kindneſſes from
them. We ſhall auoid many miſchiefes whereinto wee might
implunge our ſelues by taking reuenge, and which both God
and man might bring vs vnto for taking reuenge.</p>
               <p>3. For the <hi>Neceſſitie</hi> of it;<note place="margin">Neceſſitie of forgiuing.</note> it is abſolutely neceſſary for So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
with men, and Communion with God. <hi>In regard of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie

willing and ready to forgiue wrongs: and that by reaſon of
the wrongs which others from time to time will doe to vs,
and wee to others. Wee liue here among many and ſundry
ſorts of people, and thoſe of diuers and different diſpoſitions:
ſome giuing offence in one kinde, others in another. If we be
forward to take reuenge of euery wrong, and haue not a minde
forward to forgiue, we ſhall neuer haue a quiet minde. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge
will bee as a poiſon continually working in our ſoules,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:3438:95"/>
exceedingly diſturbing and diſquieting them. And for our
ſelues, fleſh is in vs all: it abideth in the beſt, ſo long as they
abide in this world. By reaſon of the fleſh in vs wee are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
to many infirmities, whereby ſundry offences are giuen
to others, ſometimes on weakneſſe, and ſometimes on wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe:
ſometimes on ſudden paſſion, and heate of bloud, and
ſometimes againe on deliberation and cold bloud. By reaſon
hereof we need that others ſhould beare with vs, and forgiue
vs. But if we forgiue not others, how can we looke that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
ſhould forgiue vs. 1. Our example in taking reuenge of
others, is a patterne to others to take reuenge of vs. 2. It is
iuſt with the Lord to ſuffer men ſo to doe, according to that
which <hi>Adoni-bezek</hi> ſaid,<note n="a" place="margin">Iudg. 1. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>As I haue done, ſo God hath requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
mee.</hi>
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 7. 1.</note> So much is oft expreſſely threatned. <hi>In regard of
Communion with God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 6. 37.</note> there is no hope, no poſſibilitie of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation
and atonement with God for ſuch as are ready to take
reuenge of men. Chriſt hath ſet it downe, as a ruled caſe, as
an inuiolable Law, more ſtable, and vnalterable then the <hi>Lawes
of the Medes and Perſians eſtabliſhed by the King,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Math. 6. 15.</note> that, <hi>if yee

forgiue your treſpaſſes.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Math. 18. 27, 32, 33, 34.</note> In the Parable wee reade that the Lord
who forgaue his ſeruants debt, recalled his grant, when hee
heard that ſeruant would not forgiue his fellow ſeruant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> May then that remiſſion which God granteth be reuerſed?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. That which hypocrites preſumptuouſly aſſume to
themſelues,<note place="margin">How remiſſion is recalled.</note> without due conſideration of the conditions and
qualifications of the Goſpell, may. For it is an abſolution vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtly
taken before it is fully giuen. 2. That circumſtance in
the Parable is noted not ſimply to declare any reuerſing of
Gods grant, but to aggrauate the hainouſneſſe of reuenge, and
Gods hatred of it, and indignation againſt it. And it ſheweth
that though God in himſelfe be ready and forward to forgiue,
and could and would otherwiſe forgiue ſuch a Debtor, yet if
that debter bee hard-hearted to his brother, and forgiue not
him, neither will God forgiue.</p>
               <p>4, For the difficulty of it,<note place="margin">Difficultie of forgiuing.</note> wrath and reuenge cannot eaſily
be ſubdued. A combate, and a conqueſt in that combate is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
thereto. The combate muſt be with our owne paſſions,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:3438:96"/>
and the conqueſt muſt be ouer them, which conqueſt fleſh and
blood can neuer get. <hi>He that ruleth his ſpirit is mightier then he
that taketh a Citie.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prou. 16. 32.</note> Paſſions are exceeding violent, very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
and pernicious. In vs there is a great proneneſſe to yeeld
vnto them. Our fleſh is very loth to ſtriue againſt them. What
hope then is there of any victory ouer them. Surely there muſt
bee more in vs then fleſh and bloud to ſubdue them.</p>

themſelues as farre from it, as they could. If Scorpions and
Aſpes were in mens houſes, what paines would they take to
cleanſe their houſes, that they might dwell ſecurely? But they
keepe anger, wrath, malice, hatred, reuenge, which are ſo

               <p>2. Gods requiring mercie of one, doth not iuſtifie iniuſtice

humbly to acknowledge the ſame to the partie wronged.
If an inferiour haue wronged his ſuperiour by any diſloyaltie,
let him bee the more loyall for the time to come. If one
vnder ſubiection haue bene rebellious, let him be the more

haue bene negligent or careleſſe in his buſineſſe, let
him be the more induſtrious and diligent. Let him that hath
any way dealt vnmercifully with another, take all occaſions
to ſhew the more mercie to him. He that hath any way
defrauded another, let him to his vttermoſt power make full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.
He that hath impeached the good name or credit of
another, let him endeauour to right him whom he hath diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited,
in his reputation. And ſo in other wrongs. Thus will
there be an healing of the wounds that haue bene made. And
this is <hi>fruite worthie of repentance,</hi>

muſt extend it ſelfe not to ſome part onely, but to the whole

As for the latter, we are to try if he may be brought to ſight

we doe, as we ought, fully forgiue all the wrongs done, and

                  <hi>Q.</hi> How can requiring debts, and forgiuing debters ſtand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. Forgiueneſſe here profeſſed hath reſpect rather to
wrongs done, then to commodities due. The word, <hi>Debters,</hi>
is metaphorically by way of reſemblance vſed. For hee that
doth wrong, maketh himſelfe, as a debter, bound to ſome
penaltie for the wrong hee hath done. Saint <hi>Mathew</hi> in his

We may not hate, reuile, or euilly entreat our debters for not
paying their debts.</p>
               <p>3. It keepeth our exacting of debts within the compaſſe of
mercie. Which is, that in caſe the debter be no way able to
pay the debt, we rather forgiue it, then by hard and cruell
meanes vtterly vndoe him, as by laying executions vpon all he
hath, or keeping him vnder perpetuall impriſonment.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. That, as other like precepts in Chriſts Sermon on the
Mount, is not <hi>ſimply,</hi> but <hi>comparatiuely</hi> to be taken: that we ſhold
be ſo farre from the cruell Vſurers mind, who is reſolued to

and ſuretie, we ſhould I ſay be ſo farre from ſuch a mind, as not
to looke for any thing, no not for the principall againe.</p>
               <p>2. That precept is laid downe as a rule of loue: and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

                  <hi>Let all your
things be done in charitie.</hi> Many are of opinion that no man can
go to Law in charitie. But they are groſly deceiued. For,</p>
               <p>1. He that iuſtly and rightly goeth to Law at leaſt ſuppoſeth
that he hath right on his ſide, and that the partie whom hee
ſueth doeth wrong in that for which he is ſued. Now to bring
a wrong-doer to do right, is a dutie, and fruite of loue.</p>
               <p>2. Suing in Law hath reſpect onely to that particular thing
which is in queſtion. But charitie extends it ſelfe to all things
wherein one may be profitable to another. The man that in one
particular ſeeketh to haue from another that which of right
belongeth to himſelfe, may in all other things be readie to do
what good he can to that other.</p>
               <p>3 The manner of proſecuting a ſute of Law may be, as with
all equitie, ſo with much tenderneſſe, mildneſſe, and compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and ſo that very particular be done in loue.</p>
               <p>4. In a doubtfull caſe queſtioned in Law a man may bee ſo
willing to ſtand to the ſentence of Law, as to bee content either
way, whether it goe with him, or againſt him. Yea if it appeare
that right be on his aduerſaries ſide, to bee glad that the Law
hath diſcouered right euen againſt himſelfe. Doth not this
ſhew much loue? Wherefore though by the Apoſtles prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
we are taught,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 6. 1. &amp;c.</note> as much as may be, to forbeare Law, to
ſuffer ſome loſſe, to beare with ſome wrong, and in ſome things
to part with our right, yet on the forenamed grounds, and
with the forenamed prouiſo, it is both lawfull and expedient
to ſeeke the helpe of Law: the ends whereof are very good,

and making them plyable to Gods heart and affection to vs,
mercifull as he is mercifull, kinde, gentle and patient as hee is,
forbearing wrongs, and forgiuing debts as hee doth. Hence
then it followeth, that if our diſpoſition be inclinable to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue,

               <p>1. The glory of Gods <hi>pittie</hi> and <hi>power</hi> is much magnified
hereby. <hi>Of his pittie,</hi> in that by going to him in all our miſeries
we acknowledge him to be a God of compaſſion, moued with
our miſeries: elſe could we haue no heart to goe to him. The
ſeruants of the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Syria</hi> perſwade their Lord, being
ouerthrowne in battell to go with ſackcloth vpon their loynes,<note place="margin">1. King. 20. 31.</note>

                  <hi>The glorie of Gods power</hi> is alſo
magnified by Deprecations,<note place="margin">Pſal. 51. 1.</note> in that he is acknowledged to bee
for all turnes able to doe, and able to vndoe. Able to doe that
good for vs which he ſeeth to be needfull for vs: and able to
vndoe that knot of miſery wherewith thorow our owne folly
we are bound, and to breake thoſe ſnares wherewith wee are
entangled.</p>
               <p>2. Our need requireth, that being in miſery we ſhould be
deliuered out of it: or elſe all the good that can be beſtowed
vpon vs, will bee but as a ſhew or ſhadow of goodneſſe: no
ſweetneſſe thereof can be taſted: no benefit can bee reaped
thereby. <hi>Abraham</hi> conceiuing it to bee a great miſery to be

me, ſeeing I goe childleſſe?</hi> This ſuppoſed euill tooke away the
ſweetneſſe from that exceeding great reward which was prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to him. The Iſraelites being in grieuous bondage, when

which the heart of man can deſire are as nothing to him
that is ſicke at heart, or tortured with tormenting diſeaſes, if
he bee not freed from that ſickneſſe, and eaſed of that paine.</p>
               <p>In what a deſperate caſe may we now thinke them to be,
that, being in miſerie, either ſeeke no helpe at all: or, which
is all one, ſeeke helpe of ſuch as can afford them no true
helpe.</p>

               <head>§. 158. Of doubling our care for the good of
our ſoules.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> WHy are there two Petitions for our ſpirituall good?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. The things concerning our ſpirituall
eſtate are farre more excellent: as the ſoule is more
excellent then the bodie,<note place="margin">Things of the ſoule moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent.</note> and as things concerning eternall and
heauenly happineſſe ſurpaſſe ſuch as concerne onely a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
and earthly contentment.<note place="margin">Mat. 13. 44, 45, 46.</note> The Merchant that <hi>ſold all that
he had to buy the treaſure hid in the field, and the pearle of price,</hi> was
not ignorant hereof.</p>
               <p>2. They are more abſolutely neceſſarie.<note place="margin">Things of the ſoule moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie.</note> We may want the
temporall things of this world, and yet not be miſerable. God
can turne that want to our aduantage.<note place="margin">Luke 10. 42.</note> But the want of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
bleſſings maketh vs extreamely miſerable. True happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
conſiſteth in the fruition of theſe. Yea the happineſſe of
our temporall well-fare conſiſteth in our ſpirituall well-fare.
No benefit, no comfort can be receiued from all that this world
affordeth, vnleſſe ſinne be pardoned and we freed from the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
thereof.</p>
               <p>3. We are by nature more dull and backward to ſeeke after
things ſpirituall,<note place="margin">Man careleſſe of his ſoule.</note> then temporall. Theſe are viſible, and the
ſweetneſſe of them is more ſenſible, ſooner diſcerned, and more
eaſily taſted. The other being inuiſible, are more inſenſible.
So as we haue more need to be the more earneſt in ſeeking of
them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="209" facs="tcp:3438:116"/>
Q. What are we taught hereby?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. Our care for ſpirituall things muſt be double.</hi> With much
more earneſtneſſe muſt we ſeeke ſpirituall then temporall bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings.
It is of ſpirituall good things that Chriſt ſaith,<note place="margin">Mat. 6. 33. <gap reason="foreign">

ſeeking.<note place="margin">2 Pet 1. 10. <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>.</note> Of ſpirituall bleſſings it is That Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rather
giue diligence,</hi> or giue the more and greater diligence to make
them ſure. Our mind muſt with the vtmoſt of our endeauour,
euen with full bent be carried that way.</p>
               <p>A due conſideration of this point doth manifeſt the<note n="e" place="margin">2. Pet. 1. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi>
and aggrauate the folly of them who preferre temporall
before ſpirituall bleſſings:<note place="margin">Mar. 5. 17.</note> like to the <hi>Gadarens,</hi> who made
more account of their ſwine then of Chriſt. Into this ſhip of
fooles may they well be thruſt</p>
               <p>1. Who put of the time for ſeeking the good of their ſoules,<note place="margin">Who preferre things tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall before ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall.</note>
but will looſe no time for aduancing and encreaſing their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall

               </p>
               <p>2. Who put bie the opportunities that by Gods prouidence
are afforded for doing good to their ſoules. As <hi>Felix,</hi> who
when by <hi>Pauls</hi> preaching his heart was ſo ſmitten as <hi>he trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 24. 26, 27.</note>
ſaid, <hi>Go thy way for this time:</hi> and yet watched all oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities
for a bribe.</p>
               <p>3. Who ſo eagerly purſue the things of this world, wherein
they take delight,<note place="margin">Gen. 25. 29, &amp;c.</note> or from whence they expect profit, as they
neglect the care of their ſoules. Such an one was prophane <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſau,</hi>
who followed the profits and pleaſures of the field till hee
fainted, and then ſold his birth-right for a meſſe of pottage.</p>
               <p>4. Such as ſeeke the ſpirituall things of their ſoule, but ſo
looſely and careleſly as if they cared not much for them. Theſe
are like the <hi>Luke-warme Laodiceans</hi> who can expect nothing
but to be ſpued out of the mouth of Chriſt.<note place="margin">Reu. 3. 15, 16.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Let vs be otherwiſe minded: and for that end,</p>
               <p>1. Well diſcerne betwixt things that differ.<note place="margin">Direction.</note> Till the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding

               <p>A. <hi>By pardon of ſinne the things of this world are made true bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings.</hi>
All the things which in this prayer we are taught to craue,
are ſo to be craued as bleſſings. But ſinne is as deadly poyſon

               <p>A. <hi>Iuſtification goeth before Sanctification.</hi> For
the former of the two laſt Petitions concerning our ſpirituall
good ſetteth out our Iuſtification, the latter, our Sanctification.
This precedence is to be applyed rather to <hi>Order,</hi> then to <hi>Time.</hi>
For at that very moment that Chriſt pardoneth ſinne, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueigheth
his Spirit into vs whereby ſinne is mortified. S. <hi>Paul</hi>
therefore where hee ſetteth downe theſe two together, ſetteth
<hi>Righteouſneſſe</hi> before <hi>Sanctification.</hi>

               <p>Sanctification declareth Iuſtification:<note place="margin">Iam. 2. 24.</note> in which reſpect Saint
<hi>Iames</hi> ſaith, that we are iuſtified by workes: that is, declared
ſo to be. As by vertue of our Iuſtification wee are preſented
blameleſſe before God: ſo by vertue of our Sanctification wee
are declared to be righteous before men.</p>
               <p>As the cauſe therefore goeth before the effect, and as the
effect followeth the cauſe, ſo are Iuſtification and Sanctification
in their order one to another.</p>
               <p>1. This order affordeth one ſound argument againſt Iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation

If by the merit of them we be iuſtified, Sanctification muſt goe

               <p>2. This order proueth our Iuſtification to be free.<note place="margin">Rom. 3. 24.</note> Becauſe
in order of nature it goeth before any good thing that wee

               <p>3. It alſo demonſtrateth the precedence of faith before ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable

ſinnes to be prayed for?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. 1. Knowledge of the nature of ſinne:</hi> how horrible a thing
it is: into what a wofull plight it bringeth the creature, making
it a debter to the reuenging iuſtice of God.<note place="margin">Deut. 28. 15, 16, &amp;c.</note> For this end doth

guilty of ſinne is a debter to God: and in that reſpect in a moſt
wofull eſtate. This did <hi>Dauid</hi> well know when he ſaid, <hi>I know

heauy burden of ſinne, and yet not ſeeke to bee eaſed: but lye
vnder it as a beaſt: or as one that deſpaireth of all helpe. But if

power is ſuch as it ought not to bee called into queſtion. <hi>Is
it fit to ſay to a King, thou art wicked? and to Princes, ye are
vngodly?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iob 34. 18, 19.</note> 
                  <hi>how much leſſe to him that accepteth not the perſon of
Princes, &amp;c?</hi> 2. becauſe the perfection of his puritie is ſuch
as it admitteth no mixture.<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 1. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>God is light, and in him is no dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
at all.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iam. 1. 17.</note> 3. Becauſe he is the <hi>originall fountaine</hi> of all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:<note place="margin">Iam. 3. 11.</note>
ſo as if this principle (<hi>doth a fountaine ſend forth at the
ſame place ſweet water and bitter?</hi>) bee infallibly true of any
fountaine, it is without contradiction moſt true of this origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
fountaine. On theſe and other like grounds, wee may
well know that God hath power to giue, with-hold, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
what hee will, and when hee will: and to ſupport or
forſake whom hee will: and that he is not bound to that law
which hee hath ſet to his creatures, nor to giue an account to
any. Yea we ought to acknowledge God to bee as moſt pure
in his nature, ſo moſt iuſt in all his counſels, words and workes:
and if wee cannot fully and clearely vnderſtand how the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named
actions concerning <hi>leading into temptation</hi> can bee at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
vnto God, and yet God freed from all acceſſarineſſe
to ſinne, to lay our hands vpon our mouthes, and to aſcribe
it to the ſhallowneſſe of our owne apprehenſion: but no way
to charge God with folly or ſinne. Among the Principles
which without all gaine-ſaying ought to bee beleeued, this
is one of the prime,<note place="margin">Pſal. 5. 4.</note> that <hi>the Lord is a God that hath no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:3438:130"/>
in wickedneſſe:</hi> hee can no way be acceſſarie thereto. But
beſides this abſolute ſoueraignty and perfect puritie of God,
other particular reaſons of Gods dealing with men in this
kinde may bee giuen, and thoſe ſo clearely iuſt and equall, as
any one, but ſuch an one as is blinded in his minde by the god
of this world, may diſcerne the iuſtice and equitie thereof.
For</p>
               <p>1. Where God permitteth Tempters to tempt men,<note place="margin">The ends of all Gods actions moſt iuſt,</note> it is
for good and iuſt ends, as to try and proue mens faith, cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
wiſedome, patience, and other like graces, all which
were by this meanes proued to bee ſound and great in <hi>Iob:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 13. 3.</note>
or elſe to diſcouer their weakeneſſe and ſecret wickedneſſe, that
they may neither bee too ſecure, nor ouerbold and ſelfe-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited.
By this meanes and for theſe ends was<note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 26. 33, &amp;c</note> 
                  <hi>Peters</hi> weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
diſcouered.</p>
               <p>2. Where God biddeth,<note place="margin">God ſendeth tempters as a iuſt Iudge.</note> ſendeth or inſtigateth Tempters
to tempt men, as in the caſes of<note n="b" place="margin">1. Kin 22, 20.</note>

and of<note n="d" place="margin">2. Theſ. 2. 11, 12.</note> 
                  <hi>Antichriſtians,</hi> it is as a iuſt iudge to puniſh former
tranſgreſſions, ſo as theſe Tempters are therein executioners
of Gods iuſtice.</p>
               <p>3. Where God leaueth men to themſelues, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth
his aſſiſtance,<note place="margin">God with-holds his aſſiſtance to make man know himſelfe.</note> it is to giue euident demonſtration that
man without God is nothing: no more able to ſtand of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
then a child that is new-borne. Now there is great need
that man ſhould bee euidently conuicted hereof,<note place="margin">2. Chro. 32, 31.</note> leſt hee be
too preſumptuous of his owne ſtrength, and neglect God.</p>
               <p>4. Where God with-draweth his Spirit, or any grace
from man,<note n="f" place="margin">Mat. 4. 25.</note> it is as a iuſt puniſhment for abuſe thereof. In this
reſpect God tooke away his Spirit from <hi>Saul.</hi>

               <p>To conclude this point,<note place="margin">God turnes all to good.</note> ſo farre is God from being any way
acceſſarie to ſinne by <hi>leading into temptation,</hi> as contrarily he tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
the euill thereof vnto good.<note place="margin">2. Cor. 4. 6.</note> For as at firſt he brought <hi>light
out of darkneſſe,</hi> ſo euer ſince by his Almightie power, vnſearcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

euill. <hi>Good to himſelfe,</hi> by making the glorie of his iuſtice in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing,
of his pittie in ſuccouring, of his power in ſupporting,
of his faithfulneſſe in deliuering, of his wiſedome in catching
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:3438:130"/>
the ſubtill in their owne craftineſſe, and diſappointing their
plots and practiſes, and of other his properties to ſhine forth
the brighter. <hi>Good</hi> alſo <hi>to his Saints,</hi> as <hi>Ioſeph</hi> ſaid to his brethren,

who call God <hi>Father,</hi> and who teſtifie their due reſpect to him,

recorded, and you ſhall finde the Doctrine abundantly proued.
Take one example, which may be in ſteede of all. Chriſt the dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt

               <p>Inward meanes are ſuch as delight, or affright men. Hee
worketh delight by ſtirring vp their corrupt humours and ſo
inclineth their will to his temptation. Thus hee ſtirred vp the
corrupt humor of pride in <hi>Dauid,</hi> and thereby<note n="f" place="margin">1. Chro. 21. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>proucked him

                  <hi>enter into him.</hi> The
meanes which in this kinde Sathan vſeth are drawne to
three heads:</p>
               <p>
                  <note n="h" place="margin">1. Ioh. 2. 16. expounded.</note> 1. <hi>The luſt of the fleſh:</hi> which is voluptuouſneſſe, whereby

any thing.<note place="margin">2. Tim. 3. 4.</note> Such perſons the Apoſtle ſtileth <hi>louers of pleaſures
more then louers of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. <hi>The luſt of the eyes,</hi> which is couetouſneſſe. A couetouſe
man is euen rauiſhed at the ſight of wealth. When <hi>Achan</hi> ſaw
ſiluer,<note place="margin">Ioſ. 7. 21.</note> gold, and other pretious things in Iericho, <hi>he coueted them
and tooke them,</hi> though they were accurſed. There is not a thing
of price which a couetous man caſteth his eye vpon, but inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he coueteth it, and ſo doteth thereon, as hee will doe any
thing to haue it.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Pride of life,</hi> which is ambition, and vaine affectation of
the honours and promotions of this life. This puffeth vp aboue
their mortall condition, as is euident in the examples of<note n="m" place="margin">Eſt. 3. 5. &amp;c.</note>

him, as<note n="r" place="margin">Iob. 1. 11.—2. 5.</note> hee aſſayed to draw <hi>Iob:</hi> and as hee<note n="ſ" place="margin">Ioh. 7. 13.—9. 22.</note> preuailed with

               <p>
                  <pb n="245" facs="tcp:3438:134"/>
The outward meanes which hee vfeth are ſuch externall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects
as he conceiueth to bee agreeable to their humour, and
therefore ſetteth them before them, (as he ſet before Chriſt <hi>all
the Kingdomes of the world and the glory of them:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Math. 4. 8.</note>) or ſuch as he
conceiueth to be of force to terrifie them, as are all manner of
troubles and afflictions. Thus it is ſaid that the Diuell <hi>caſt</hi> ſome
of <hi>Smyrna,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Reu. 2. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>into priſon.</hi> Whether the meanes which are vſed
to draw men to ſinne be faire or foule, by none of them is the
will forced: but only moued to yeeld it ſelfe to the temptation.</p>
               <p>This point affordeth two vſefull directions.<note place="margin">The blame of ſinne to be laid vpon ones ſelfe.</note> One is in regard
of ſinnes paſt to iudge our ſelues for them, and vpon our ſelues
to lay the whole blame: and not to thinke it a ſufficient excuſe
to lay the blame vpon any other. Many will ſay when they are
taken in ſome notorious ſinne, <hi>The Diuell owed mee a ſpight,
and now hath paid mee it,</hi> thinking thereby to extenuate their
ſinne;<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 13.</note> which conceit <hi>Eue</hi> had, when ſhee ſaid, <hi>The Serpent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiled
mee.</hi> And if any man haue beene any occaſion of their
ſinne,<note place="margin">—12.</note> they will lay the blame vpon them, as <hi>Adam</hi> did vpon
<hi>Eue.</hi> But had they beene reſolute in their owne will, nor
Satan, nor any of his inſtruments could haue made them to
ſinne. They who thus thinke to ſhift off ſinne, doe bring the
greater load vpon their owne ſoules. For this keepes them
from that degree of humiliation and contrition<note n="a" place="margin">Iſa. 66. 2.</note> which would
moue God to pitie them. When men in truth lay loade on
themſelues,<note place="margin">Math. 11. 28.</note> God is ready to eaſe them. For to ſuch as <hi>Labour
and are heauy loaden</hi> Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Come vnto mee, I will giue you
reſt.</hi> But on ſuch as by the ſhifting of ſinne thinke to eaſe
themſelues, God will lay loade. What<note n="f" place="margin">Math. 23. 13.</note> loades of woe did
<hi>Chriſt</hi> lay vpon the hypocriticall <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſies,</hi> who
put off all burdens from themſelues? What a loade was laid
on<note n="t" place="margin">1. Sam. 15. 20, 21, 22, 23.</note> 
                  <hi>Saul,</hi> that by mincing his ſinne ſought to eaſe himſelfe?
and<note n="u" place="margin">2. Sam. 12 13</note> what eaſe was giuen to <hi>Dauid,</hi> that laid the burden of ſin
vpon himſelfe?<note place="margin">Vera confeſſions, non falſa defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſione opus habet. Aug. de Nat. &amp; gra c. 53.</note> Now whether it be ſafeſt ſo to ſhift off ſin, as to
prouoke God to lay the burden of it on vs, or ſo to burden our
ſelues as to moue God to eaſe vs, iudge you. Is there not now
more need of true confeſſion, then falſe iuſtification.</p>
               <p>The other direction is in regard of ſuch ſinnes as wee are

<pb n="246" facs="tcp:3438:135"/>
and boldneſſe to our ſelues, and, with a reſolued purpoſe neuer
to yeeld, reſiſt the temptation. Mans will, if he ſtand ſtoutly,
and yeeld not, is an impregnable fort. Satan muſt by ſome
meanes or other, faire or foule, bring a man to yeeld vp his
fort, before he can enter into it. What ſtronger motiue to reſiſt,

as this particle AND doth import. Reade for proofe of
the indiſſoluble connextion of theſe two, Rom. 6. 1, 2, &amp;c.
1. Cor. 6. 11. Eph. 5. 25.</p>
               <p>The grounds hereof are,</p>
               <p>1. The manifeſtation of mercie and puritie in God.</p>
               <p>2. The cleanſing vertue which accompanieth the merit of
Chriſts ſacrifice.</p>
               <p>3. The operation of the Spirit immediatly iſſuing from our
incorporation into Chriſt.</p>
               <p>4. The efficacie of the Goſpell.</p>
               <p>5. The vertue of faith.</p>
               <p>All theſe are euidently ſet out by the coniunction of Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
with Iuſtification.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Iuſtification</hi> commendeth the rich <hi>mercie</hi> of God in acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
ſinners freely and fully of all that debt wherein they ſtand
obliged to his reuenging iuſtice.<note place="margin">Gods mercie &amp; puritie manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted by mans Iuſtification and Sanctification.</note> And <hi>Sanctification</hi> ſetteth out
his <hi>puritie:</hi> ſhewing that<note n="a" place="margin">Exod. 34. 6, 7.</note> that God which pittieth ſinners,
will not boulſter vp ſinners in their ſinnes. His <hi>pittie</hi> moueth
him to <hi>iuſtifie</hi> them, and his <hi>puritie</hi> moueth him to <hi>ſanctifie</hi>

               <p>2.<note place="margin">A merit and a vertue in Chriſts bloud.</note> That bloud of Chriſt which is<note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 26. 28.</note>

                  <hi>bloud</hi> and <hi>water</hi> which iſſued out of Chriſts ſide while he

               </p>
               <p>3. By the Spirit of ſanctification we are vnited vnto Chriſt:
and this ſpirit by vertue of that vnion is conueyed into euery
of the members of Chriſts myſticall body.<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Now if any man haue

not the Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of his.</hi> But if his Spirit be in any,
it ſanctifieth them.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>The grace of God which bringeth ſaluation</hi> (that is,<note place="margin">The Goſpell a word of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe.</note> the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell)

                  <hi>righteouſly, and godly.</hi> That word therefore whereby
we are iuſtified giueth no libertie to any licentiouſneſſe, but
doth both direct vs in the way of righteouſneſſe, and alſo gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
vs abilitie to walke in that way. Hereby it appeareth that
the Goſpell is as pure and incorrupt as the Law.<note place="margin">Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Law and Goſpell.</note> Indeed the
Law is ſo perfect a rule of righteouſneſſe as it curſeth euery
one that in the leaſt degree ſwarueth from it:<note place="margin">Deut. 27. 26.</note> which the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
doth not, but offereth pardon to the tranſgreſſor. Yet doth
it no more tolerate, or countenance the leaſt ſinne, then the Law
doth: nay rather it bringeth the ſinner that hath gone aſtray,
into the way of righteouſneſſe againe, and enableth him to
walke in that way, which the Law cannot do. So as herein the
Goſpell hath an excellencie ouer the Law. But if the Goſpell
in ſhewing mercie, ſhould boulſter vp a ſinner in any one ſinne,
the Law would triumph ouer the Goſpell, yea and condemne
it. It is therefore neceſſarie for iuſtification of the Goſpell that
ſanctification continually follow iuſtification, as an hand-maid
her miſtreſſe; or rather that, as two ſworne friends and fellowes,
they alwaies keepe company together.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>Faith purifieth the heart.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Faith purgeth.</note> For that man which in truth belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
his ſinnes to be pardoned,<note place="margin">Acts 15. 9.</note> will not like a ſwine wallow in
the mire. A true apprehenſion of Gods Fatherly loue worketh
a filiall loue in mans heart: which loue maketh him as truly to
deſire and endeauour after Sanctification as Iuſtification.</p>
               <p>They therefore who boaſt of their iuſtification and are not
truely ſanctified,<note place="margin">Reproofe of carnall Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers.</note> ſeuer Gods purity from his mercy, and the
vertue of Chriſts ſacrifice from the merit thereof, yea the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration

they turne the grace of God into wantonneſſe, and proclaime
their faith to be a fruitleſſe and a liueleſſe faith, and in fine giue

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> VVHat are the particulars to be prayed for vnder the
ſecond part of the Sixt Petition,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. 1. Recouerie from ſinne being fallen into
it.</hi>

Pſalme, eſpecially in this phraſe, <hi>Renew a right ſpirit within mee.</hi>
Repentance is that grace whereby ſuch as are fallen recouer
themſelues, as is euident by this aduice which Chriſt giueth, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
from whence thou art fallen,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Reu. 2. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>and repent.</hi> Repentance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is heere to be prayed for. Satan is as much diſappointed by
repenting of ſinne, as by not yeelding to ſinne.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Diſpoſſeſſion of Satan.</hi> Satan is that <hi>Euill one</hi> that hath his
finger in euery euill thing. So long as hee abideth any where,
freedome from euill cannot he expected. If hee therefore haue
really entered into any,<note place="margin">Mat. 15. 22.</note> as he did into the woman of <hi>Canaans</hi>
daughter, we muſt pray, as ſhe did, to haue him diſpoſſeſt. For
<hi>by prayer and faſting he may be caſt out.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mar. 9. 29.</note> If otherwiſe hee ſeaze on
vs by putting into vs euill thoughts, or ſtirring vp corrupt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
or ſetting before vs euill obiects, or affrighting vs, or
vexing vs any way in ſoule or body, we are taught to pray for
deliuerance from him.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Alienation of heart from the world.</hi> They who haue beene
bewitched by the world, ſo as they haue loued the ſame, and
haue beene entangled therein, which is a great euill, ought to
pray to bee pulled out of it: and to haue their hearts turned
from it, as the heart of <hi>Amnon</hi> was from <hi>Tamar:</hi> ſo that the
hatred wherewith they hate it,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 13. 15.</note> may bee greater then the loue
wherewith they loued it. This wee ought to pray for in regard
of lewd company, vnlawfull games, vndue honours, vniuſt
gaine, immoderate pleaſures, or any other like thing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
wee haue beene bewitched. Till our hearts bee alienated
from the world, we ſhall neuer bee throughly deliuered from
the euill of the world.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>Suppreſſion of all the luſts of the fleſh,</hi> after they are riſen vp.
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:3438:144"/>
Preuention of them is implied in the former part of this Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
If that be not obtained but that the fleſh doth riſe vp &amp; luſt
and rebell againſt the Spirit, our deſire ought to bee, to haue
thoſe luſts beaten downe againe, and we freed from the thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of them. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> reckons vp 17. particular luſts of the
fleſh together.<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 19, 20, 21.</note> Thoſe and other like to thoſe are all ſimply e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill,
ſuch euills as if they be not beaten downe and we deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
from the bondage of them, will bring vs to eternall death.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>Remouall of iudgements.</hi> Such afflictions as come from the
wrath of God, and ſo long as they lie vpon vs, manifeſt his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation
againſt vs, are as euills to be prayed againſt. In which
reſpect thus prayeth the Church, <hi>Turne vs againe, O God: and
cauſe thy face to ſhine.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 80. 3, 4.</note> 
                  <hi>O Lord God of Hoſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how long wilt thou be
angry?</hi> Such a iudgement was that Plague for the remouall
whereof <hi>Dauid</hi> built an Altar,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 24. 25.</note> and offered Sacrifice. Among
theſe, ſpirituall iudgements are moſt earneſtly to be prayed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt:
ſuch as were mentioned in the end of the laſt §. If the
preuention of them be to be prayed ſon much more deliuerance
from them. For they are doubly euill. 1. As they are ſinnes.
2 As they are puniſhments of ſins, and effects of Gods wrath.
To this head may be alſo referred all manner of croſſes, as<note n="a" place="margin">Pſal. 46. 9.</note> war,

whereof we may pray, as was ſhewed<note n="*" place="margin">§. 124.</note> before.</p>
               <p>6. <hi>A bleſſed departure out of this world.</hi> So long as wee are in
this world we are ſubiect to many euills, which lie and preſſe
ſore vpon vs. But by death we are deliuered from them all: at
leſt if our death be <hi>in the Lord.</hi> For they only are <hi>bleſſed that die
in the Lord.</hi> They which die not in the Lord, are not deliuered
from euill: but like the fiſh which leapeth out of warme water
into flaming fier,<note place="margin">Reu. 14. 13.</note> go from the leſſe euill into the greater by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
degrees.</p>
               <p>Q. May a man then pray for death?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Not ſimply and abſolutely, with deſire to haue the time
appointed by God, preuented, but with ſubmiſſion to the
good pleaſure of God. Concerning our departure out of this
world two things are here intended. 1. That we be willing no
depart. 2. That our departure be in the Lord. Both theſe are
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:3438:145"/>
manifeſted in old <hi>Simeons</hi> ſwanlike-ſong: where hee ſheweth
his willingneſſe to <hi>depart,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 2. 29.</note> and his deſire to depart <hi>in peace.</hi> So
much alſo is euident in Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> deſire.<note place="margin">Phil. 1. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>I haue</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>a
deſire to depart.</hi> This was not an abſolute prayer for death. It
was a manifeſtation rather of what he could willingly haue wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed,<note place="margin">Votum affectus, non effectus.</note>
in his owne behalfe, then of what he peremptorily or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
would deſire. Now where hee addeth, <hi>and to bee with
Chriſt,</hi> hee ſheweth what kinde of death hee deſired. And this
we muſt abſolutely deſire, that when we dye, we may dye the
death of the righteous, an happy death: which is a finall deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
from all the euill whereunto in this world wee are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect.</p>
               <p>7. <hi>Reſurrection of the body.</hi> For death in it ſelfe is an euill, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the body in the graue as in a priſon where it rotteth and
conſumeth. The reſurrection of the body is it that maketh a
mans diſſolution to be a bleſſing. Thus is his body by death as
ſeede ſowne in the ground which bringeth forth an harueſt.
This Chriſt hath promiſed:<note place="margin">Ioh. 5. 28.</note> this therefore wee may and muſt
pray for.</p>
               <p>8. <hi>Abſolution at the day of iudgement.</hi> When our bodies
are raiſed, they together with our ſoules ſhall be preſented be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Chriſts tribunall ſeate. There to bee condemned for our
ſinnes, is a farre greater euill then any that in this world can
befall vs. And better it were that our bodies ſhould neuer be
raiſed, then bee raiſed to condemnation. Oft therefore doth
the Apoſtle pray for the Saints that they may be kept <hi>blameleſſe
vnto the comming of Chriſt.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Theſ. 3. 13.—5. 23.</note>
               </p>
               <p>9. <hi>Aeternall glory in heauen.</hi> They who are aduanced there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
are fully deliuered from all euill, and from all feare of all
euill.<note place="margin">Reu. 21. 4.</note> In which reſpect it is ſaid that <hi>God ſhall wipe away all teares
from their eyes:</hi> that is, hee ſhall take away all occaſions of
mourning: therefore by way of explication it is added, <hi>There
ſhall be no more death, neither ſorrow, nor crying, &amp;c.</hi> This was
it that the penitentiary thiefe prayed for in theſe words, <hi>Lord
remember me when thou commeſt into thy Kingdome.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 23. 42.</note> Thus we ſee
how this prayer directeth vs to pray for al things that are need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
for vs, from that corruptible bread whereby our mortall

For 1 where <hi>Abram, Iſaak, Iſrael,</hi> and <hi>Dauid</hi> are named, Gods
Couenant made to them is intended: ſo as no worth in their
perſons, but Gods truth in keeping his Couenant made with
them, is pleaded. 2. where mention is made of his ſeruants
Oath and Vow, the honour and glory which by their oath and
vow was couenanted to God, is meant: ſo as not the worth of
the oath and vow, as mans worke, but the matter thereof,
which tended to Gods glory, is pleaded. The praiſe of God is
in this forme of the Lords Prayer chiefly intended: and<note n="u" place="margin">Pſal. 22. 21, 22.</note> oft
by the Saints expreſſed and pleaded in their prayers,<note place="margin">—79. 13.</note> to enforce
the same.<note place="margin">—119. 175.</note> 3. Where the integritie and vprightneſſe of any of
Gods Saints is produced in prayer, it is to be conſidered as an
effectuall worke of Gods Spirit, and an vndoubted euidence of
Gods fauour; ſo as no deſert of man, but the ſtampe of Gods
owne worke, and pledge or ſeale of his owne fauour &amp; grace
is pleaded. Beſides reſpect hereby may be had to the truth of
Gods Couenant: as in <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> caſe. For God had made a
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:3438:153"/>
Couenant with <hi>Dauid,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 132. 11, 12.</note> and confirmed it by oath, that <hi>his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
euen the fruit of his body, if they kept Gods Couenant, ſhould
ſit vpon his Throne for euermore.</hi> Now <hi>Hezekiah</hi> being lineally
deſcended from <hi>Dauid,</hi> and hauing endeauoured in all ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
to keepe Gods Couenant, was ſo ſicke as he receiued the
ſentence of death before he had a child to ſucceed him on the
Throne of <hi>Dauid.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Kin. 20. 1, &amp;c.</note> Wherefore for ſparing of his life, at leaſt till
hee might haue iſſue, and Gods Couenant thereby bee verified,
hee pleaded his integritie, which was the condition required of
God: hee pleaded it, I ſay, not as a matter of merit, but as an
euidence that the God of truth would make good his owne
word. Gods truth and faithfulneſſe therefore is the ground of
<hi>Hezekiahs</hi> plea. 4. Where the miſeries, afflictions, and deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
of Gods people are vrged in prayer, there Gods pittie
is eſpecially aimed at. For miſery is the obiect of mercie and
pittie. That obiect is laid forth, to giue aſſurance that the God
of pittie will afford ſuccour where ſo fit an obiect for ſuccour is
preſented before him. Yea in this kinde of plea, Gods truth,
and power is alſo aimed at. For the greater the diſtreſſe is, the
more euidently is Gods power manifeſted in giuing deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.
And God hauing promiſed to deliuer his Saints out of
all their troubles, by mentioning any troubles of his Saints vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, his owne promiſe, and his truth in keeping promiſe is
pleaded. 5. Where the inſultations of enemies are preſſed as
a reaſon, the ground of that reaſon muſt needs bee the honour
of God, becauſe ſuch inſultations make to the diſhonour of his
great name. Thus by anſwering theſe obiections diſtinctly,
the truth of the Doctrine is made more cleare, that the onely
true ground of a ſufficient plea in prayer, is in God.</p>
               <p>The grounds of plea which papiſts teach and practiſe muſt
needs be falſe, becauſe they are not taken from God. They
are theſe, <hi>Interceſſion of Saints, Bloud of Martyrs, Supererroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie
workes of extraordinarie perſons, Merit of a mans own workes,</hi>
and others like to theſe. What ſtrength can theſe adde to faith
in prayer? What aſſurance can they giue of being heard, when
they depend on man, and haue no warrant out of Gods
Word?</p>
               <p>We that are better inſtructed, ought to take notice of the
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:3438:153"/>
things whereby God hath made himſelfe knowne to vs: being
compriſed vnder this Title the<note n="a" place="margin">See §. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>name of God.</hi> And when wee
come to prayer, meditate thereon ſeriouſly, that our faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
grounded on ſo ſure a Rocke as God is, and on his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
and properties, wee may with comfort and patience
expect a gracious anſwere, and bleſſed grant of our Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The reaſon added to the Petitions being generally touched, It is
further more diſtinctly in the ſeuerall branches thereof to
be handled.</hi>

                  <hi>A.</hi> Not ſuch things as import impotencie, or imperfection.
Gods power were not omnipotent, but rather impotent, if
thoſe were within the circuit thereof. Such phraſes therefore as
theſe,<note n="e" place="margin">Tit. 1. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Cannot,</hi>
                  <note n="f" place="margin">Heb. 6. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>Impoſſible,</hi> are, in relation to thoſe things, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
to God.</p>
               <p>Some of the particulars, which by reaſon of omnipotencie,
God cannot do, are theſe.</p>
               <p>1. Matters of <hi>contradiction:</hi> as one thing at the ſame time <hi>to
be</hi> and <hi>not to be:</hi> or one and the ſame thing to be <hi>infinite,</hi> and <hi>fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite.</hi>
Such things are in their nature impoſſible. And God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
eſtabliſh them, becauſe they are againſt truth, and imply
impotencie. For whatſoeuer is, it is by the power of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor:
and by his power it is as it is. If withall it <hi>be not when it is,</hi> or
be contrary to what the Creator maketh it, where is the power
of the Creator? If he himſelfe ſhould bee ſuppoſed to eſtabliſh
ſuch contradictions, he cannot be ſuppoſed to eſtabliſh them by
his power. The one part is by power, the other therefore muſt
be, if it could be, by that which is contrary to power, euen by
impotencie.</p>
               <p>2. Matters of <hi>iniquitie:</hi> All ſinfull matters. As theſe are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the will, puritie and perfection of God, ſo they ariſe
from impotencie of vnderſtanding, will, memorie, conſcience,
affection, and actions. By power it is that any either do not, or
cannot ſinne. By weakeneſſe it is therefore that any fall into
ſinne. Theſe emphaticall phraſes (<note n="i" place="margin">Gen. 18. 25.</note>

The originall roote (<gap reason="foreign">

is for euer. Now becauſe an <hi>age</hi> is the longeſt vſuall diſtinction
of time, the ſame word that ſignifieth eternity is put for an age.
And when there is no end of that which is ſpoken of, the plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
number indefinitely without any limitation, thus, <hi>for ages,</hi>
is vſed to ſet out the euerlaſtingneſſe of it. But euerlaſtingneſſe,
or eternitie is diuerſly vſed in Scripture. For ſuch things are
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:3438:163"/>
ſaid to bee <hi>for euer, euerlaſting, eternall,</hi> which haue <hi>both begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

               <p>1. The things which hauing both beginning and end alſo
are ſaid to be eternall and for euer,<note place="margin">1. Such as haue both beginning and end.</note> are 1. Such as haue no ſet

that heape which was made of the ruines of <hi>Ai,</hi> neither was

                  <note n="b" place="margin">Deut. 13. 16.</note> The like is noted of that heape which was
to bee made of that Citie where Idolaters were harboured.
2 Such as are immutable while their date laſteth. Thus<note n="c" place="margin">Exod. 21. 6.</note> the
things which remained inalterable for the time of a mans life
are ſaid to bee <hi>for euer,</hi> as the ſeruice of him whoſe eare was

which endured all the time of the Iewes pedagogie, and politie

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. To acknowledge him to be the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

thus prayeth,<note place="margin">Pſal. 102. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>O my God take mee not away in the middeſt of

power to continue ſeruice to the <hi>Eternall</hi> for euer. If all gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
were carefull euery one in their time to ſerue God, the
mortalitie of man would be no hindrance to the perpetuitie of
Gods ſeruice. Abraham <hi>called vpon the name of the euerlaſting
God.</hi>

carefull in his time to worſhip him.</p>
               <p>6. To make him knowne to poſteritie. This is a further
meanes of procuring an euerlaſting name to the euerlaſting
God. For our poſteritie being inſtructed by vs, may declare
Gods name to their poſteritie: and ſo poſteritie to poſteritie
throughout all generations. Marke theſe things (ſaith the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt)
that ye may tell it to the generations following:<note place="margin">Pſal. 48. 13, 14.</note>

God is our God for euer and euer.</hi>

               <p>7. To depend on him for our poſteritie. Wee are mortall,
and ſhall not euer liue to prouide for our poſteritie. But God
remaining for euer wee may well commend ſuch as ſuruiue vs
to his prouidence, and depend on him for his care ouer them.

               <p>5. Some things are eſſentially in themſelues immutable: and
ſo immutable as it is impoſſible they ſhould be changed: as</p>

                  <hi>Obiect.</hi> Saint <hi>Luke</hi> hath left out this clauſe. Luke 11. 1. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Hiſtory which Saint <hi>Luke</hi> recordeth as an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion

Saint <hi>Mathew</hi> recordeth, but another.</p>
               <p>The occaſion mentioned by Saint <hi>Mathew</hi> was this. The
hypocriticall Phariſees got to themſelues the name of deuout
perſons by their frequent, and much praying. But Chriſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruing
their Deuotion to be but plaine ſuperſtition, diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
ſundry of their aberrations both in the manner and alſo in
the matter of their prayers, and to giue his Diſciples and others
a patterne, whereunto if they held cloſe, they might ſufficiently
be directed in the matter aud manner of prayer, he preſcribeth
that forme which is thereupon called <hi>the Lords Prayer.</hi> It was
therefore neceſſary that this patterne of Prayer ſhould be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
without deficiency, or ſuperfluity.</p>
               <p>The occaſion mentioned by Saint <hi>Luke</hi> was this. <hi>Iohn</hi> the
Baptiſt had declared to his Diſciples what things eſpecially they
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:3438:172"/>
ſhould by prayer aske of God. Thereupon Chriſts Diſciples
entreate their Maſter to doe the like for them. On this occaſion
therefore it was ſufficient for Chriſt to note out ſuch principall
points as were moſt behoofull to be asked of God, though hee
did not preſcribe ſo perfect a forme as that which is recorded
in his Sermon on the Mount. Let it now bee well conſidered,
whether they that vſe the Lords Prayer as a perfect patterne,
haue ſufficient cauſe from <hi>Lukes</hi> not mentioning of this forme
of praiſe, cleane to omit it.</p>
               <p>Surely as Saint <hi>Mathew</hi> hath recoded this prayer, Chriſt vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered

world can be performed. The celeſtiall ſpirits ſpend their time
therein, Reu. 5. 13. And 7. 11, 12. &amp;. 19. 1. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>9. A ſetting forth of Gods praiſe, is an eſpeciall meanes to
quicken the ſpirit, and to make the heart the more ready to
prayer, and the more cheerefull therein. When the Pſalmiſts
heart was ſet to <hi>Praiſe the Lord,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 57. 8, 9.</note> then he ſaith to his tongue, and
inſtruments, <hi>Awake vp my glory, awake Pſaltery and Harpe, I my
ſelfe will awake early.</hi> When the Spirit of a man is dull and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy,
ſo as he cannot pray, let him meditate on Gods mercies
and other excellencies, and ſet himſelfe to praiſe God, and hee
ſhall finde a ſpirituall vigour thereby put into him.</p>
               <p>10. Ingratitude is one of the moſt odious vices that can be:
deteſtable to God and man.<note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 2.</note> The Apoſtle reckoneth it vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
thoſe notorious vices that ſhould be in the world in the
laſt and worſt times thereof.<note place="margin">Iſa. 1. 2, 3.</note> The Prophet herein maketh ſuch
as did beare the name of Gods people to bee more bruitiſh
then the bruteſt of beaſts, the Oxe and the Aſſe. Nothing
more prouoketh God to take away his bleſſing, as he threatned
<hi>Iſrael.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hoſea 2. 8, 9.</note> The things which God vſeth to beſtow vpon gratefull

moſt memorable iudgements that are recorded in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
were cauſed by vngratefulneſſe.<note place="margin">Gen. 6. 2. &amp;c.</note> When God had culled a
Church out of the world, who in that reſpect were called <hi>ſonnes

with daughters of men: which made God repent that he
had made man, and thereupon he brought vpon the world that
generall deluge, wherewith he ſwept away all but eight per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.<note place="margin">Compare Gen. 14. 16. &amp;c. with Gen. 18. 20, 21. &amp; Gen. 19. 24.</note>
After that God by his ſeruant <hi>Abraham</hi> had reſcued So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and the neighbouring Cities from the hand of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
they were not carefull to render praiſe to God, but conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
in their beaſtly abominations. They were therefore all
burnt with fire and brimſtone from heauen.<note place="margin">2. Chr. 36<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 16, 17.</note> Iſraels vngrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe

God to giue ouer the Gentiles to a reprobate ſence:<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 21. &amp;c.</note> and
to giue Chriſtians ouer to Antichriſtianiſme.<note place="margin">2. Theſ. 2. 9, 10, 11.</note> This cauſed that
<hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> was made as a beaſt; and that <hi>Herod</hi> was eaten

               <p>

               <p>All theſe ſhew that God is moſt worthy of all praiſe.</p>
               <p>1. Excellencie in any thing is praiſe worthy: as excellencie
of knowledge, excellencie of wiſedome, excellencie of power
and ſtrength, excellencie of any vertue, yea excellencie of elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
excellencie of beautie and euerie other excellencie. It is
ſaid of the woman whoſe excellencies were many,<note place="margin">Pro. 31. 30, 31.</note>

praiſe be due to any, much more to God. That very praiſe
which in any reſpect may lawfully be giuen to any creature, is

<hi>Bleſſed be the Lord which ſent thee this day to meet me:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Sam. 25 32, 33.</note> 
                  <hi>and bleſſed

the glorie which was giuen to him he was eaten of wormes.</hi> Beſides
there are ſuch infinitely ſurpaſſing excellencies in God, as no
creature is capable of: as <hi>Selfe-exiſtencie, Etermitie, All-ſufficiency,
Immutabilitie, Omnipotencie, Vbiquitie, &amp;c.</hi> That praiſe therefore
is due to God,<note place="margin">Exod. 15. 11.</note> which may be aſcribed to no other. For <hi>who is
like vnto thee, ô Lord, amongſt the Gods? Who is like thee, glorious
in holineſſe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Sam. 2. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>fearefull in praiſes, &amp;c. There is none holy as the Lord:
for there is none beſide thee: neither is there any rocke like our God.
Great is the Lord,</hi>

                  <hi>and greatly to be praiſed.</hi> Thus we ſee how Gods
excellencie miniſtreth iuſt and great cauſe of praiſing God. If
when we are about to praiſe God, our hearts were deepely
fixed on a due meditation and ſerious conſideration of Gods
excellencies, they would bee much quickened vnto this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
dutie of praiſing God.</p>
               <p>2. Soueraigntie maketh one to be much praiſed. Who more
praiſed then Kings? They are praiſed for the things praiſe-worthy
in their owne perſons, and praiſe-worthy in their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects.
If in a kingdome there be learned Deuines, faithfull Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,
iuſt Magiſtrates, wiſe Counſellers, valiant Souldiers,
victorious Captaines, skilfull Artificers, induſtrious Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
obedient Subiects, the King is much praiſed for them all:
and it is ſuppoſed that his wiſe and good gouernment is the
cauſe of all. Beſides praiſe vſeth to be proportioned according
to the dignitie wherein men are. The higher a mans place is,
the more praiſe vſeth to be giuen to him. Kings therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the higheſt in their Dominions, greateſt praiſe vſeth to bee
giuen to them. But God hath beene<note n="a" place="margin">§<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 207.</note> prooued to be the moſt
ſupreme and abſolute Soueraigne ouer all, The <hi>King of Kings.</hi>
On this ground we are thus incited to praiſe God, <hi>Sing praiſes
to God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 47. 6, 7.</note> 
                  <hi>ſing praiſes, ſing praiſes to our</hi> KING, <hi>ſing praiſes: for God is
the King of all the earth, &amp;c.</hi> This reaſon is giuen of the heauenly
<hi>Halelu-iah,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Reu. 19. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>For the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.</hi> As God by his
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:3438:175"/>
Soueraigntie is the higheſt of all, ſo by vertue of his prudent
gouernment, all good things which are any way praiſe-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,
are indeed done. They that haue knowledge hereof, and
can in truth of heart acknowledge as much, will aſſuredly bee
ready on all occaſions to praiſe God.</p>
               <p>3. Kindneſſe, goodneſſe, and mercie are the things which do
moſt of all enflame the heart to giue praiſe. They are the moſt
principall obiect of praiſe, for which thankes vſeth to be giuen.
<hi>I will praiſe thy Name,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 138. 2.</note> ſaith the Pſalmiſt to God, <hi>for thy louing
kindneſſe.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 117. 1, 2.</note> And he exhorteth <hi>all nations</hi> to <hi>praiſe the Lord,</hi> on this
ground, <hi>His mercifull kindneſſe is great towards vs.</hi> After hee had
thus ſet out the goodneſſe of God,<note place="margin">Pſal. 145. 8, 9, 10</note> 
                  <hi>The Lord is gracious, and full

all, and his tender mercies are ouer all his workes,</hi> he maketh this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
<hi>All thy workes ſhall praiſe thee, ô Lord: and thy Saints ſhall
bleſſe thee.</hi> Gods mercies therefore, the maine matter of praiſe,
are to be called to mind, and to be ſet in order, when we go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to praiſe God. Theſe are they, that are of greateſt power
to rouſe vp our dull ſpirits, to put a ſpirituall life into vs, and

directeth the Church to pray, reade and preach in a knowne

               <p>If the words ſpoken bee not vnderſtood,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 14. 9.</note> they are as ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

<pb n="333" facs="tcp:3438:177"/>
ſometimes a figuratiue ſence and meaning, which if it bee

                  <hi>Take heed and beware of

                  <hi>Ob.</hi> AMEN is an Hebrew word: that language is vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
of very few: why then is it vſed of all Nations, of all
people in all Nations, learned and vnlearned?</p>

as we haue an expreſſe warrant for retaining this word in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

though the one be <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and the other <hi>Greeke,</hi> are made ſo
familiar, as in all languages they are retained.</p>
               <p>3. No other one word ſo fit for the purpoſe, can in any other
language be inuented, as <hi>Amen</hi> is. Not without reaſon there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and iuſt cauſe is it, that it hath beene made a word of all
languages. It compriſeth vnder it whatſoeuer is expreſſed or

words,<note place="margin">Deut<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 27. 26.</note> (<hi>Curſed be hee that confirmeth not all the words of this

               <p>1. To ſpeake <hi>intelligibly</hi> in a knowne tongue. This is a point

Armour of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <note place="margin">Neh. 8. 8.</note> whereby the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
better vnderſtood what was deliuered. If Prayer or
Thankſgiuing be vttered by a voluble, ſwift tongue, too faſt,
hearers cannot aduiſedly obſerue the ſeuerall branches there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:
ſo as if they ſay AMEN, at the beſt, it cannot bee but
to ſome parts: it cannot bee to all the prayer, or praiſe that is

ſpeech vttered by others.<note place="margin">Duties which <hi>Amen</hi> requireth of ſuch as heare a prayer.</note>
               </p>

that ſaid <hi>Amen</hi> to <hi>Ezra</hi> his bleſſing, are ſaid to <hi>ſtand vp,</hi> while he

aſſent, what deſire, what faith can there be? And if there bee
none of theſe, to what end is <hi>Amen</hi> ſaid? Surely it is a plaine
mockage of God.</p>
               <p>2. To giue <hi>aſſent</hi> therto. If with the mouth <hi>Amen</hi> be vttered and
no aſſent giuen with the heart, heart and tongue are repugnant,

muſt vtter <hi>Amen,</hi> as loud as the Miniſter vttereth the
prayer. In many places it is put off onely to the Clerke. But
herein all ſhould bee Clearkes. There is mention made of a
celeſtiall ſound, which was <hi>as it were the voice of a great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,

                  <note place="margin">Reu. 19. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>and as the voice of mighty

did all of them andibly after a prayer ſay <hi>Amen,</hi> ſo audibly
as the ſound of euery ones voice there preſent might come at

a Miniſters ſpirits, and put a kinde of heauenly life into the
people themſelues.</p>
               <p>The duties which are required both of ſpeaker and hearers
by vertue of <hi>Amen</hi> to be added,<note place="margin">Duties which <hi>Amen</hi> requireth both of Speaker and Hearers.</note> are theſe that follow.</p>
               <p>1. To know the ground of all that is vttered, that that which
is mentioned, whereunto <hi>Amen</hi> is to be added, is grounded on
Gods Word, and agreeable to his will. For <hi>this is the confidence
which we haue in him,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Ioh. 5. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>that if wee aske any thing according to his

               </p>
               <p>2. To haue the minde fixed thereon. The minde of the

                  </gap>ng and wandring:
eſpecially when a ſet, preſcribed, vſuall forme of prayer is vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered:
or when a prayer is read. Now becauſe the vtterer of a
prayer muſt ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to his owne prayer, as well as the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
he, as well as they, and they, as well as hee, euen all of
them muſt hold their minde ſteady thereon;<note place="margin">Iſa. 29. 13.</note> elſe <hi>will their heart
be remoued from God, while they draw neere to him with their
mouth:</hi> which is an abomination to him.</p>
               <p>3. To retaine, as well as they can, in memorie all that
is vttered. For <hi>Amen</hi> muſt bee applyed to the whole ſpeech,
and to euery part thereof. Matters well retained in memorie
make <hi>Amen</hi> to come from the heart, and to bee vttered with a
goodwill.<note place="margin">Pſal. 42. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>When I remember theſe things, I poure out my ſoule in
me,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt. That which is forgotten, is as not heard,
or not vnderſtood, or not attended vnto.</p>
               <p>4. To be affected with the prayer. This will make men
double their <hi>Amen,</hi> as the Iewes did <hi>when</hi> Ezra <hi>bleſſed the

affection of heart? Without this inward affection <hi>Amen</hi> will be
but coldly vttered.</p>
               <p>5. To beleeue Gods gracious acceptation of the prayer.
It hath beene<note n="a" place="margin">§. 241.</note> before proued that <hi>Amen</hi> is a ratification of
all that which is vttered before it. But with what heart can
that which is not before beleeued, bee after ratified. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely

               <p>Well therefore may we ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to all the Petitions of the
Lords Prayer: to thoſe fiue, which are of bleſſings abſolutely
promiſed, with an aſſured faith of obtaining the very things
which are prayed for. To that wich is not ſo abſolutely promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
(which is the fourth) with ſuch a ſubmiſſion of our ſelues
wholy to Gods good pleaſure, as to beleeue that God will do
that which he in his wiſedome ſeeth to be beſt for vs. That he
will giue ſuch temporall bleſſings as he knoweth to be good for
vs: or giue vs ſuch grace as ſhall enable vs to beare the want of
ſuch things as he denieth vs. What God denieth to the Prayers
of his Saints, he knoweth that it is good for them to be without
it. He therefore that is well inſtructed in Gods wiſedome, and
aſſured of his loue, will without queſtion thinke it much better
to haue that which God knoweth to be hurtfull, or vnmeet for
him, to be denied, rather then granted vnto him.</p>
               <p>If that which we pray for, bee not at the firſt granted, wee

               <p>2. To ſhew the vſe of it.</p>
               <p>For the extent of AMEN, It muſt be applyed to the whole
Prayer that goeth before it, and to euery part and particle
thereof. Therefore in reciting the particular curſes of the Law,
<note n="*" place="margin">Deut. 27. 15. &amp;c.</note> AMEN was expreſly added to euery particular curſe. Though
ſo expreſly by an audible voice it be not alwaies added to euery
clauſe of euery Prayer, yet the mind giuing aſſent, and the heart
inclining a deſire, and mind and heart yealding faith to the
whole and to euery part, <hi>Amen,</hi> after all is vttered is a teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of as much. Thus then by ſaying AMEN when all the
Lords Prayer is ended, we ſhew that our aſſent, deſire and faith
is extended to praiſe, as well as to Petition: and, among Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
to ſuch as tend to Gods glorie, as our owne good: and,
of them which tend to his glorie, to that which maketh to the
proſperous encreaſe of his Church, as well as to that whereby
his Name is hallowed: yea and to that which tendeth to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his will, and that in the manner of doing it, as it is done
in heauen, as well as in the matter thereof: and among the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions
that tend to our good, as well to them which concerne
our ſpirituall well-fare as to that which concerneth our tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
well-fare: and of thoſe which promote our ſpirituall well-fare,
as well to that whereby our ſanctification is craued, as to
that whereby we deſire to be iuſtified: and in that of our iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
of our profeſſion of forgiuing our debters, as well as to
our ſupplication for Gods diſcharge of our debts to him: and in
that of our ſanctification, both to preſeruation from Satans aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults,
and alſo to recouer out of his ſnares, and full deliuerie
from all euill: yea in euery Petition to others good, as well as to
our owne. Were <hi>Amen</hi> placed in any other place then in the
very end of a prayer, euen after all is finiſhed, it could not haue
ſo large an extent.</p>
               <p>2. For the vſe of AMEN, It is a recapitulation, or collection
into a briefe ſumme, of all that hath gone before, ſo as it being
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:3438:181"/>
vttered when the prayer is finiſhed, it ſheweth that when all
particulars haue been in ſpeciall mentioned, we muſt as in a
generall view caſt our mind vpon them all againe, and reuiew
our deſire of them: As <hi>Salomon</hi> did more amply and expreſly.
For after he had finiſhed his long, pithy, powerfull prayer which
he made at the dedication of the Temple, with a new and freſh
deſire hee compriſeth the ſumme of all, and thus commendeth
it to God,<note place="margin">1. King. 8. 59.</note>

to breake off Prayer. Whenſoeuer we preſent any Prayer to the
