            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Small part of this Subject,
many years since had drop'd
from my pen: But looking
at some opportunities upon
the Argument, I thought some things
more considerable might be deduced;
and applying my self further, at times
of recess, I felt it grow and multiply un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
my imagination: Nor left I it then
(the matter being so pregnant in it self)
till I form'd it into such limbs and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions
as you now see it. Modesty
after this, invited me to cover it, and to
cut off many impertinences, and purge
some humour, that sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e, I confess, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handsomely
upon it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:103130:3"/>
What is now presented, I hope will
appear a genuine and unforc'd Moral,
which though drest in Drammatique
Ornament, may not displease, in the
reading, persons of ingenuity, such whose
nature is not to create prejudice, where
they intend a recreation. And in the
confidence of that, I do not repent the
superstructures I have made, my pains,
nor expences that have attended to
bring it to this. It is now publique to
satisfie the importunity of friends, I
will onely adde, it is like to be the last,
for in my resolve, nothing of this nature
shall after this, engage either my pen or
invention.</p>
                  <p>The reason why I make no particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Dedication to any Friend, is, because
I aim my general respect to all, whose
favours and civilities have oblig'd me.
At this none will be offended, where
<pb facs="tcp:103130:3"/>
none hath the precedence: And to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
with the most serious truth, I
know not any, that love me so little,
whom the payment of my so mean ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses
would satisfie, as to clear me up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the account of his friendship. Let
this suffice at present from him, that is</p>
