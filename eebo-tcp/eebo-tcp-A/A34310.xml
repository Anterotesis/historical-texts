            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And though I might be juſtly angry with ſome, yet I ſcorn to take notice of any. For ſhould I begin to un-dreſs all theſe prodigious ſhapes, and ſet them out ſingly in the naked truth, into what a Confuſed Chaos ſhould I bring my ſelf? How endleſſe ſhould I make my ſufferings? how many years might I lead my life in diſcontent, before I could hear, anſwer and ſatisfie the many Niceties, Queſtions, Curioſities and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections of the Giddy-headed Vulgar.</hi> Qui non adveritatem rei, ſed ad opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem proſpiciunt. <hi>I am ſatisfied, that as a little time will make a diſtinction between the report and the reality, ſo it will put a concluſion to both, by burying them in Oblivion.</hi>

Nor ſhall I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to procure a great Credit in any one, eſpecially in ſuch whoſe narrow ſoul and ſingle threaded faith, cannot believe the Vindicative Oath of a Chriſtian; Which I dare take to any Aſſertion that I ſhall modeſtly, and I proteſt without any thing of ſingularity, or Affectation, hereafter lay down, concerning the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of my Intentions and Actions; Neither will my troubled thoughts, (Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Reader) give me leave to look at the lofty ſtyle, nay not time to ſalute the Garment of that Noble pleading and Worthy Orator</hi> Cicero: <hi>And indeed it beſt becomes truth to be naked, and gloſſes of Eloquence, in ſome peeviſh Humours, might invoke jealouſies of the intended reality; but as I reſpect the leaſt appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of the Wiſe and Judicious, ſo I neglect and diſdain the greateſt cenſure of the Ignorant and Malicious. I ſeek for no ones ſoothing applauſe, nor I care for no perſons rigorous cenſure; I only beg every Ingenious Reader (to whoſe ſetled and diſcerning Judgements I ſubmit) to make a Charitable Conſtruction, and to paſſe by all errors you may without doubt find in this little Book, which my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſed judgment will not at this time permit me to ſee; And I may ſay of theſe lines, as diſcontented</hi> Ovid <hi>ſaid of his Verſes.</hi>

            <p>MArriage is my Theam, and I cannot but look at Happineſs, and I think it is a very great Bleſſing, when the hand of Providence beſtows on Mortals, a ſuitable conjunction of Vertuous and Good Conditions in VVed-lock, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which parity none can be really happy therein: And they know not what marriage is that onely know how to luſt. I ſhall not ſtand to Comment, but will come nearer to my preſent Condition. I was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to write at all, but I will not write much. It was my happy, unhappineſs, about the <hi>25th.</hi> day of <hi>March</hi> laſt, accidentally to happen into the Houſe, where that (in ſome things worthy) unworthy Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was, ſhe being in the Company of a Perſon or two of Honour; of whoſe being there when I was informed, I was willing to return an acknowledgment of my Gratefulneſſe, for then late received Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſies, It being the firſt oppertunity that was offered to me, after the receit of them; Among whom alſo I was willing and did ſpend ſome time for a diverſion. She, as She hath proteſted to many perſons ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times ſince, at my entring of the room, was ſuddenly poſſeſſed with a ſtrange kind of an affectionate paſſion, and could not ſatisfy her ſelf till ſhe had made a ſtrict enquiry who I was; nor did it ceaſe there, for preſently after She imployed a Friend of mine to deſire the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of my Company, as She hath ſince declared.</p>
            <p>Here I thought good to inſert the Original of our acquaintance, that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:43343:3"/>
the world may the better perceive her cheating deſigne: though it hath pleaſed the ſcurrilous Scribler, that either hath no name, or elſe is aſhamed of it, in a late Pamphlet to demonſtrate a very great Friendſhip to that <hi>Diſtreſsed Lady,</hi> as his Pedantick Pen terms her; and though he ſpeaks without Book, as moſt if not all do beſides him; yet he endeavous to make it credible that it was She that carried on a humour and my Relations wi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h my ſelf a Deſigne, which I deny on both ſides, and here atteſt, that not any of them to whom I owe the Duty of a Son, or the Love of an own Brother, did ever ſee her until many dayes after Contraction, nay not untill three dayes before Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and then never entertained any diſcourſe to promote, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to hinder the Proceedings; For She of her own accord, upon a Viſit ſhe gave them, told them of her Affection and Intention and did Politickly and freely declare to them her Great Birth and Fortune. But to return to our firſt Acquaintance; I underſtanding her Fancy, and finding thoſe Excellent parts ſhe was poſſeſſed with, cold do no leſſe, then poize things in my mind: And conſidering her Endowments, ſuppoſed that ſhe wanted nothing that might cauſe a likeing, nor had ſhe any Defect, that might procure a loathing. I preſſed her to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of her Fancy, She replied <hi>Love gives none.</hi> I minded her of the Inequality between mine, and her then thought High Deſcended Birth and Fortune: She Anſwered <hi>Love knows none.</hi> I Objected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, (ſhe telling me, that ſhe ever Related to me the leaſt of both) and put Caſes of great Danger, to be called in Queſtion, beyond all Law; She Replyed, <hi>Love knows no Lawes; Let her Judgement alone to ſecure both.</hi> Her Wit did more and more Charm me, Her Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties deprived me of my own; Her Courteous behaviour, Her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick Humility to all Perſons, in all her Actions, Her Emphatical Speeches, Kind and Loving Expreſſions, and amongſt other things, her High Deteſtation and Checks to an untruth, though Jeſtingly uttered by any; Her great Zeal to her Religion, her Modeſt Confidence, and Grace in all Companies, ſeating the knowledge of none; Her variety of Tongues; Her neat limned, and ready anſwers to all, and all manner of Objections, that I, or the moſt Critical Perſon in the World, (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſparaging any ones Judgement) could in point of Honor, make and put to her, whereby to diſcover her, ſhe would ſo Nobly, and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly Salve, that ſhe left no room for Suſpition; Which did not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly work the belief in me, (that hath wrapped me in this preſent Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune) But alſo in many Perſons of great Wiſdome, Gravity, and Quality; All which in a growing Acquaintance and Converſation,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:43343:3"/>
did encreaſe our Credit. She deſired nothing of me but my Love, (And that as She told me and others was alwayes her intention to Marry a Private Gentleman, whom She could Love, that She might oblige him highly to love her by her Nobility and Eſtate;) An Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent bait indeed) And I thought She did nobly deſerve that. She ever proteſted a Fervent Love, and I could not promiſe an unfaithful. And finding in her ſo Noble a Perfection, who could miſtruſt a reall Affection and Intention? None but did Eſteem her Pearleſſe in all qualities of mind. Who could have called her Honour and Honeſty into queſtion, when they both, (I muſt ſay ſeemingly) were ſo great? But the Scene was ſoon changed, though I could not ſo ſoon believe it. And in a ſtrange manner there was a ſuddain diſcovery of the truth, which is too long a ſtory to inſert here, though in a ſhort time it was made appear that She was ſuch a cheating perſon, as before a Majeſtrate She was proved to be. Such a ſuddain alteration, might (like thoſe that looked on <hi>Meduſae</hi>'s Head) have turned me into a Stone; I could hardly put out my former belief; Nay I proteſt, when I ſeriouſly reflect on all the paſſages of her former Expreſſions &amp; Actions (not in the leaſt think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the laſt Act) I can believe ſtill; For what perſon living, that is a Chriſtian, or bears the name only, or knows the meaning of that title (which She in a High manner did own) Nay, what <hi>Turk, Jew, Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del</hi> or <hi>Heathen</hi> that ſees, wonders at, and Worſhips the Sun, Moon and Stars, and that never heard the Name of the Great <hi>Jehovah,</hi> could Counterfeit and Religiouſly gloſſe over ſo many haynous and deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Crimes, without fear of a ſuddain and mighty Judgement? Sure ſhe thought to Hood-wink Divine Providence: The Devil himſelf, that old Sophiſter, might be cheated by her, but that he is ſo well acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with her. Without doubt he would have trembled to have invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked thoſe Direful Judgements which She wiſht might befall her, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on clearing ſome doubts, if ſuch things were not true, which are as falſe as God is true. And amongſt all her Proteſtations I will name only one, which was the onely thing we deſired to know the truth of, that was this, upon the Atteſtation of one or two ſtrangers to us, who upon the firſt ſight knew her, ſhe having lodged at their Houſes; they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated of her ſeveral Husbands ſhe had living; We preſſed her to ſpeak the truth, and in the preſence of ſeveral perſons upon her knees, ſhe wiſht for a ſudden Judgement to befal her, and that ſhe might Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally hang in Hell (for ſo were her words) if ever ſhe was Contracted, Married to, or knew any man beſides my ſelf. Oh Miſerable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture! I hear ſo many things dayly of her of truth enough, that I think
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:43343:4"/>
ſhe hath the beſt part of a ſcore, and ſhe hath <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> what, leaſt I run into extreams; it is enough, I now find her Honour Diſhonour, her Proteſtations Pretences, her Faithfulneſs Fickleneſs; and though her Policy did undermine me, her practiſes, will over-throw herſelf. Who would have imagined that deceit, the Divels great bait, ſhould have lodged here, or that ſo Noble a mind (though She hath baſely Acted) ſhould deſcend of ſuch an Ignoble Race, or that ſo great and Diſcerning a Capacity ſhould proceed of ſo baſe and undeſerving Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geny? Baſe indeed, for her Father in Law (her grand Agent and factor) did in the preſence of a perſon of quality, and another Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and myſelf, upon our entring into diſcourſe of the News of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> when we left it, and of the great Cheat, and ſo proceeding in the ſtory of it, he fell into ſuch a great rage, and ſaid, <hi>It was no News to him, for he was in Town all along, and was with her in the Priſon that day ſhe was Committed,</hi> and declared <hi>her Name,</hi> and that She was his <hi>Daughter in Law, for it will be known</hi> ſaid he; That unworthy low ſpirited, though hot ſottiſh-headed fellow deſerves a further ſtrictExamination. I need not relate where he lives, nor what he is, former Prints ſpeak truth in that. But to return to her, the World ſtill finds in her the ſame Wit, and they will ſhortly find leſſe honeſty then any did Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine: would She had leſs Wit, and I better fortune; but though my won affections have ſtung my ſelf and fortunes, they ſhall kill neither. Had ſhe been but honeſt, I ſhould have taken her diſcourſes of Nobility and Wealth, but as a neat Romance to gloſſe over the want of a happy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which my Relations and my ſelf did really inform her, ſhe ſhould have, could ſhe vindicate and prove her honeſty. Would her High pretended Honour had been but reall intended honeſty. I am not alone in the Cheats of Marriage, (for I believe ſcarce one in twenty proves true, and anſwers all Expectations) though perhaps not in ſo high a nature. There are many Preſidents higher then this, nay more then I mean to recollect: <hi>Menalaus</hi> after his ten years War won but a ſtrumpet. There is nothing new under the Sun, though new to them that ſuffer it. I can now ſhake hands with my Old Grand-ſite <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſay with him, <hi>The Woman beguiled me, and I did, &amp;c.</hi> I could pitty her rather then puniſh her, and yet the Law muſt puniſh her, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe did not pitty her ſelf, knowing how narrowly ſhe hath eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the Execution of Judgement after her former Tryall. The faiteſt fly is ſooneſt taken in the ſpiders Web. Indeed ſhe weaved a fine one to catch me, it is well if ſhe hangs not her ſelf in it. I truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> me, ſhe hath not overcome me; and the chiefeſt Victory will be, that I can overcome my ſelf, and prevent the danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conſequences and ſad effects that unhappy accidents and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents might cauſe. My ſore, though it be angry I can ſalve it; And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, as it argues much folly in any perſon to let the Afflictions and Cenſures of the World come ſo near ones heart, as to ſet out or inſlame ones blood, ſo it is a great part of wiſdom in my Eſtimation to ſuffer admittance ſo near as to raiſe ones ſpirits to underſtand an affliction by a ſerious conſideration and reflexion. How mixed with mercies, and in the Higheſt way we Mortals can retaliate, (if I may ſo ſpeak) to return and expreſſe a holy gratitude to Divine protection: for we muſt ſo bear our afflictions, that as our grief may not utterly deject us, ſo we muſt have the ſence to feel and apprehend it: All the actions of a mans life, are mixt with bitter ingrediences, like Chequer-work, black and white. There is no armour againſt our fates, and they are as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain as unevitable. I am contented with mine, and I hope now the bitter part of my fortune is paſt, I may once taſt the ſweet; if not, I ſhall be contented, knowing from whoſe hand it comes; I am ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, that as I have done nothing diſhoneſtly, ſo I care for no reports.</p>

            <p>BUt I have exceeded my Intention, and unleſs I mean to make a Chronicle of the whole, muſt ſtop all further expreſſion. And here I would end, but upon ſecond thoughts, in point of Reputation, I find my ſelf engaged highly, to take greater notice of abuſes done to others my Acquaintance then to my ſelf; and now I muſt be angry, for it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns me to be ſo, and it ſhould quickly be ſeen that the fancy pen of that Audacious and Injurious Libeller ſhould ſoon be cut by ſeveral perſons, were it but known where that Corrupted and Diſeaſed ſoul hath its being, which ſhall not want for a ſtrict enquiry. I wonder how he durſt preſume to inſert in his Libel termed <hi>(The Ladies Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)</hi> the name of that Virtuous and Noble Lady which I will not here denominate. The Salt-water Grave Cox-comb hath publiſhed it too much already; Or that his Confidence ſhould permit him to diſcover any thing of her Actions in <hi>Hide-Park,</hi> which though there may be
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:43343:5"/>
ſome little thing of truth, yet it is falſely ſet out. And indeed I am much troubled that that deceitful woman, to whom I then thought my ſelf Related, knowing her own Condition, ſhould offer to play upon that Worthy Ladyes Civility, And I cannot but take notice that this baſe Detractor ſhould be ſo impudent as to throw a dart againſt that deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Gentleman my Friend, that performed the ſacred Office of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony. I am not willing to inſert any ones Name, you may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand me by deſcription. Who prompt him to inſert the report of a double Marriage? And that Politick lye of ſo great a gratuity as fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen pounds; I will not ſatisfie his weak brain what it was, it is enough to let him know that my friend was ſatisfied, and I did ſo much as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a Gentleman.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, I will clear but one thing more as to her Name, by which ſhe was Contracted and Married to me, which was <hi>Henrietta Maria De Wollway,</hi> though ſhe hath ſince learned ſo much Confidence as to deny it, or elſe ſome one for her; And here I make a full ſtop, wiſhing all the World better fortune.</p>
