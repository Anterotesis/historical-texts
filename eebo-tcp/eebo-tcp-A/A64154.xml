            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>TO you the Sanctified, Elected, Purified, Mundified, Justified, and Separated Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, I make this worthy and acceptable (although not Learned) Apology. It is not unkown to you how often we have beene vilified by the name of <hi>Puritans, Brownists, Separatists, Familists,</hi> and (at last) censur'd with the detestable name of <hi>Round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads</hi> and <hi>Prickeares;</hi> that wee are so 'tis confest, but why should we be tearmed so in the way of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, or villification, the manner of speaking makes the difference, I have knowne one man call another <hi>Sir</hi> in anger, likewise a woman beat her Maid by the name of <hi>Gentlewoman,</hi> termes in themselves gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and acceptable, but according to sinister con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, the parties so termed appeare scandalized and rediculous: next they abuse our Doctrine of Inspiration, and tell us it proceeds from the spirit of contradiction, but little do they imagine our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction is begot by inspiration: for unlesse our bodies be haunted with sanctified spirits, how is it possible we should reveale the word, since most of us scarce know a word of the Booke, and that is the reason that we can preach as well without a Booke as with it, but if we can continue and confide as wee have begun (which I shrewdly doubt) it shall bee law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb facs="tcp:65626:3"/>
for every Elder and every Select Brother to use a <hi>Horn-booke</hi> (provided he be married) for I have heard a little reading will do a man no hurt, let him be learned past the Graces and the Sacraments, and (for ought I know) hee may bee as fit to teach as the best on's, and go roundly on with his businesse, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his own head, and in conclusion gain the prick and praise, agreeing with his Auditors Eares, which are long enough to make Asses of those that write our Names backwards, and fix them before li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellous Sermons, saying they do <hi>NOT RVB,</hi> when they do Rub, and rub the skin of to, wofull experience has made it manifest, but thogh we desire to have our heads rounded, we not care to have them rounded so close; there ought to be a mean in all things, but now Ile proceed to my Apologie which must prove how necessary it is for a Tradesman of any degree, to preach in a Tub, reach against the back of a Chaire, instruct at a Tables end, exhorting over a Buttery hatch, Revealing in a Basket, Reforming on a Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side:</p>
            <p>I shall begin with the first, and produce you the sacred Antiquity of Tubs, in the Days of <hi>Dido</hi> and <hi>Richard</hi> the third, There lived an honest, Religious, and fair spoken man called <hi>Diogenes,</hi> a <hi>Round-dealing</hi> Man, and was so inspired with the spirit of oposition, that he boldly durst affront the King, and bid him stand from betwixt him and the Sun; and beleeve it there was some mistery in those words: This man (to make short of my Tale) lived in a Tub, and he being a devout man, we must of necessity have this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment allowed, that if he lived in a Tub, he preached
<pb facs="tcp:65626:3"/>
also in a Tub, so that at last hee Reformed the King, who would daily leave his Palace to hear his worthy and Religious Tub Lectures, I wish our Times would not be more proud then the former, hee was a man of good life and conversation, and the Squares went <hi>Round</hi> with him, and when hee was smitten in Age, the King gave him the Title of Elder every day with which he continued till the houre of his Death, and so much for this piece of Antiquity.</p>
            <p>In the dayes of King <hi>Arthur</hi> of <hi>Bradley,</hi> and his four hundred forty sixe Elders of the <hi>Round</hi> Table, the first men that ever wore <hi>Round-Robins,</hi> there li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a Pastor whose Fame (you all have had a spice of) called <hi>Cornelius,</hi> a sickly man, and did all in a Tub with very good Ordure, and one that was inspired with the spirit of <hi>Repentance,</hi> and a man whose Zeal to the Sister-hood hath caused him in one Lecture to sweat six hours by the clock, where it was his Fate by the heat of overmuch <hi>Devotion,</hi> to conclude his dayes, and preach his own Funerall Sermon.</p>
            <p>And so much Testification I think may stand to justifie the lawfulnesse of the aforesaid Tub, whose spirituall <hi>Hoopes</hi> I hope vvill never fayle.</p>
            <p>The Back of a <hi>Chaire</hi> is so far from having prio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the TVB, that it is much inferiour to it, and is never provided, but vvhen the good Wife hath employed the TVB about some other busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, the body must as vvell be eased as the mind, but most commonly it is a vvicker Chair, vvhich though it bee not altogether <hi>Round,</hi> is halfe
<pb facs="tcp:65626:4"/>
round, and doth almost agree as well with the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall groane as the Tub, and in case of necessity may serve as well (take top and bottome) as the Tubbe; but we doe not boldly (as that Arch Square head of prophanenesse the Pope doth) tearme our Chaire St. <hi>Peters</hi> Chaire, though wee have much more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and so it being needlesse to justifie with stronger Arguments the benefit of the Chaire, it being to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward noon, I will draw neere the Tables end, where I doubt not but I shall picke out many wholesome Arguments, and enough to satisfie any reasonable man without that prophane porridge the <hi>Service-Book,</hi> and in this piece of Doctrine (by your favour) will be my owne Carver: this Table being finished with substance to worke upon will allow a sweete savour, and not strengthen but advance the spirit, and maintaine it when it is up, then if this place be not fit that alloweth both forme and matter, Ile stand to the censure of the veriest Epicure, who I beleeve would sooner swallow this Doctrine than a great many that seeme to make a more religious professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And now I have satisfied at the Tables end, I will make no more Apologie for it, since apparant truths are rather bindered then helped with tedious Arguments.</p>
            <p>I will now set forward to my Revelation in a Basket, which hath beene held sacred because it was given at the cost and charges of our inspired <hi>Basket maker,</hi> a man inspired with much Charity, and got all his reliefe by the Basket, it was by himselfe dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to the Sheriffes, and by them well furnished for the full edification of the poore, needy, and impriso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned brethren, who have suffered for the conforming
<pb facs="tcp:65626:4"/>
and tearing off of Surplices; and why may not a man piously and zealously confirm the aged, and enstruct the youth in a Basket, as well as in a pulpit: the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles end Lecture being ended for the Rich, the Bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket Lecture for the poor and needy, let us proceed to the Buttery Hatch, which is the fittest place in my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion to administer the liquor of Life and spiritual drops of comfort, where some zealous men of our Brother-hood have so overtyred themselves with earnestnesse in this Doctrine, that they have growne uncensible, not able to stand on their legs, or give a ready word, that even with <hi>Maudlin sorrow</hi> percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their weaknesse to proceed no further, they have wept with very griefe, being supported home with expectation of next mornings Remedy.</p>
            <p>But he whole strength of brain and power of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit will preserve to hold out this Buttery Hatch Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, may with much ease administer <hi>Reformation</hi> on a Bed-side, where inspired with the Spirit of Vnity, we constantly conclude, and joyn in a copulative love without the unnecessary assistance of any light, but the flame of our own Zeal, with which I doubt not, but that we are equally furnished, proceeding from the pretious Coals of Devotion: and inflamed by the provoking Administry of the last Doctrine. I hope these Arguments will suffice sufficiently to <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nform you of the necessary and profitable causes we have to vindicate and appologize for the Dignity of private preaching in so many Forms and according to this Method I shal now march on to the spiritual Postures, which have allusion to those for Pike and Musket, in which I will not prove tedious.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:65626:5"/>
It is not unknown to you my beloved <hi>Round-heads</hi> that there may be a spirituall warfare, in which you are not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly exercised in the postures of your Doctrine you will goe neere to suffer, and all the select of us; the first I will instruct you in shall be that alluding to Pike.</p>
