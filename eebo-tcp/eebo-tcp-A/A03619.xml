         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Christ Iesus our

            <p>IT hath alwayes bene the practise
of Sathan and his subtill souldiers
the papistes, euen the sworne ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries
of Gods truth, that when
thei can not preuail against the same
by tyrannye and tormentes, they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boure
to deface it by most impudente
sclaunders and lyes (the chiefest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
and staye of their kingedome)
as thou shalt see (good reader) in this
treatise folowynge. For when they
coulde by no tiranny nor cruel hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linge
dyscourage this man of God
frome the constante confession of the
truth, they stirred vp most shamfull &amp;
cursed lies against him that he should
be a priuye maintayner of suche as
cursed the Quene, but to their owne
perpetuall shame and ignomye. For
whilest they haue soughte by thys
<pb facs="tcp:22875:3"/>
meane to bringe Gods eternall veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye
in to contempte and too make it
more odious to the worlde: what els
haue they done but dysclosed theyr
owne wickednes and malice and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
him occasion so to paint out their
falsehode and lyinge spirite in their
righte coloures, by this pithye, lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and worthy little pece of worke:
that all men may hereby clearly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue
whose children they are, and
they them selues shall nede no other
glasse to see how like their father thei
looke, the father of all falsehode and
lyes. And to the ende that this theyr
wicked dealinge, whiche haue thus
proudly set them selues against God
and agaynste his Christ in his poore
members, may be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> better knowen &amp;
regestred to the worlde and the poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to come, to their shame and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion,
and to the auauncing of gods
glorye in the innocente sufferinge of
his saintes, thus torne and rente by
tiranny, tormentes, lyes, and sclaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
for his names sake: beholde
the prouidence of god, who hath now
<pb facs="tcp:22875:3"/>
brought this worke to lighte, which
otherwise by the negligence of some
was like to pearishe. And here haue
I iust occasion to discommende those
men whiche do defraude the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of such worthye monuments.
Greate was the care of this blessed
man and other for the church of God,
and manye frutefull workes did they
write in prison, in bands, in setters,
but fewe are come to lighte: and shal
we like carelesse and ingratfull peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
suffer these Godly laboures, these
painfull trauales, thus to pearishe?
how desirous thei were to haue them
published, to wytnesse to the worlde
that whiche they taughte and sealed
with theyr bloud, and to profyt their
bretheren: it appeareth by this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
earnest request to the readers of
this treatise, which is that they wyll
not kepe it close to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues, but as
sone as thei haue red it, set it abroad &amp;
communicate it to other. And that
request whyche he make the concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
this treatise, do I here general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
make in his name and others and
<pb facs="tcp:22875:4"/>
in the behalfe of the churche of God
for the rest of their workes, to them
in whose hands they remayne, that
they wyll not suffer them to be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
any longer (for that is it whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
Sathan and the ennemies of the
crosse of Christ do mooste desire) but
cause the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be set abroad in printe to
the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modity of many. And trulye it
mighte seeme to be a laboure no lesse
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendable for the learned then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
for the houshold of God to be
as diligent in searchinge and setting
foorth of suche worthye works, as in
penning and publishing of new. So
full are they of heauenlye doctryne,
so full of power of Gods spirite, so
full of comforte, and consolation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge
wrytten as it were out of gods
sanctuary, wyth the fynger of God,
by menne euen then out of the world
and in heauen alreadye: that in dede
thei are most worthy to be sought for
as precious Iewelles and treasures.</p>
            <p>For God knowethe what lacke
we haue of such trumpettes to stirre

counter by the stockes in London.
Further marke the tyme when the
thinge was done that I commended:
before they were taken, as my letter
to them doth testify. Marke also what
the personnes be that are accused of
this cursinge: suche as yet vntyll the
tenth of Ianuarye I knewe not nor
haue hearde of. And to those that be
accused of the crime, my letters were
not sente nor neuer came. Yet doeth
the wickednesse of the wicked papy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes
<pb facs="tcp:22875:8"/>
saye that I encoraged them in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyll
doynges, my letters neuer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myng
vnto them, nor when I wrote
knew I of any such cursing. Farther,
suche as bee taken and imprisonned
for that faulte, I neuer knewe of,
nor of anye suche thinge too be done
by them, vntyl (as I sayd) the tenth
daye of Ianuary, whiche was (as I
haue learned) at the leaste syre dayes
after the faulte was done, and three
dayes also after my letter was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
and deliuered to them that were
in an other prisonne, frome suche as
did thys crime. Wherfore if the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
were not paste all shame, chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye,
loue, and honesty: howe coulde
they of conscience blowe and <unclear>blaste</unclear>
abroade such wicked lyes and scaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
that neither agreeth wyth the
matter of my letter, nor with the
personnes, nor with the place wher
the crime was commytted, nor yet
wyth the tyme when the curses were
vsed.</p>
            <p>There was neuer true subiectes in
<pb facs="tcp:22875:8"/>
suche daunger as we poore English
men be at theese present dayes. The
falsest menne of the worlde, yea the
Satanicall papistes, may saye what
they wyl, so that they speake against
any that lauoureth God, his word, &amp;
the holye catholike church of Christ:
and his accusation vs it neuer so false
by that time it hathe bene in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistorye
courte and handlinge of the
Bishoppes one daye or two, it shall
haue some fayre pretensed colour to
make it appeare true, and also to be
done only for conscience sake, as all
their religon is hipocrisye and colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with holynesse in name. I haue
bene alwayes a true manne to al the
estates of thys realme, I wyll stande
with the lawe in that pointe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue
myne accusers what so euer
they be. As for my truthe and loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altye
to the Quenes hyghnesse, the
tyme of her mooste daungerouse e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
can testifye wyth me, that when
there was both co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundements and
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>missions out against her, whereby
<pb facs="tcp:22875:9"/>
she was to the sighte of the worlde,
the more in daunger, and lesse lyke
to come to the croune: yet when she
was at the worste, I rode my selfe
frome place too place (as it is well
knowen) to wyn and stay the people
for her party. And wher as an other
was proclaymed, I preferred her not
wythstandynge the proclamations.
And to helpe her as much as I could
when her highnesse, was in trouble,
I sente horses oute of bothe shyres,
Gloucester shyre and Worcester shire
too serue her in her greate daunger,
as Syr Iohn Talbot knyghte and
Wylliam Ligon Esquier can testify
the one dwellynge in the one shyre,
and the other in the other. Seyng in
aduersitye I was wyth her, and did
her seruyce, then I beyng at liberty:
It is falselye and wickedlye conspy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by the papystes, that nowe she
being in reall possession of the croune
and in prospertytye, and I a pryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
in captiuitye, woulde be againste
her.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:22875:9"/>
But wher as the pope wyll for a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye
of two pence geue remission of
all synnes <hi>a pena et culpa</hi> the wicked
may saye and do what thei luste: and
the innocent lambes of Christ suffer
what so euer God shall permytte the
members of Antychristes kyngdome
to laye vppon them. Yet maye the
Godlye see the pretensed and false y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magined
treason of theese Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes
against me. Doubtlesse it is not
because they bear good will and loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altye
to the Quenes highnesse that
they would bringe me in to her dys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure.
For all the world knoweth
she hathe no more nor no greater e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
then those that desire to leaue
no mouthe open in this realme too
speake and sound the name of Iesus
Christ in fayeth and vnderstanding.
I take recorde hereof at the bishoppe
of wynchesters booke of true obedy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
of Bonners Epistell intoo the
same booke, of Culbert Tonstalles
sermons, and Doctoure Sampsons,
oration made onelye aduisedly, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely,
and deliberately against the
<pb facs="tcp:22875:10"/>
Quene and the pope, and be openly
in all mens handes, aswell with in
the realme as withoute. But such be
the inscrutable iudgementes of God
that her highnesse should punysh her
poore, true, and louing subiects that
neuer offended her, and also make
false trayterous bishops Iudges of
truer men then they be them selues.
Doubtlesse if euer I had written or
spoken the tenth parte of treasonne
that her owne bishops bokes do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne,
I knowe theyr charitye is so
burning and seruent that the crowes
and byrdes of the ayre shoulde haue
eaten my fleshe before this daye. Yet
I am not sorye, but doubtelesse (I
speake and write frome the bottome
of my harte before God) very glad to
se mercy shewed vnto offenders. But
I speake it to this ende that I verely
suppose, as the Quene doth forgeue
offenders: so wold she not wittingly
punish me and other true men that al
wayes haue done her good and no
harme. For she is by the lawes of
God as much bound to be indifferent
<pb facs="tcp:22875:10"/>
and fauourable to true men, as true
men be bound to geue her obedience.
And (be it spoken withoute all pride
and malice) I defye him whatsoeuer
he be (the magistrates beinge honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red)
that dare open his mouth to the
contrarye. But alas sauinge I wold
not offend the law of my liuing God,
that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeth me to obey al ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates
and lawes (which disagree
not from his holy worde) it were for
me a more easye death to be hanged
like a traytoure, then burned like an
heretyke. But seinge death must en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
the true religion and faith of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christe: I wyll not appoint God
what deathe he shall take me oute of
this lyfe by. I am in Christe wholy
and throughly at a pointe wyth the
worlde. I praye dailye and wyll pray
for my persecutors eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as for myself.
But their <unclear>tira<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ny</unclear> and death, that they
will kyll me with all, I contemp<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e &amp;
passe nothing of. I am no better then
my master Christ was in his seru<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ce.
if I dy therfore by his grace whether
it be by <unclear>fyer</unclear>, or sworde, or halter, it
<pb facs="tcp:22875:11"/>
is all one to me: and the rather death
commethe the better shall it be wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come.
For the soner shall my soule
rest wyth Abraham Isaac and Iacob
in my heauenly fathers kingedome:
Whereof in Christe I am assured to
<unclear>bee</unclear> a ryghte heire, ordayned to the
same of mercye by hym: before the
worlde was made.</p>
            <p>The phariseis did not laye onely he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resye
to Christes charge: and in dede
the manner of his deathe vppon the
crosse was not appointed for heresye
amonges the Iewes, but rather sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
too deathe. There was neuer a
pair of stocks in the town that Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mye
the prophet scoured not, but still
his accusers, the false priestes made
theyr acusations in bothe states as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well
in heresye as in treason: leaste
the kinge shuld not punish the poore
preacher for preachinge, but let him
go. So Christes accusers (the holye
bishops and preastes) when they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued
that Pilate sauoured the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocenie
cause of Christe, and sayd he
found nothing that they layd against
<pb facs="tcp:22875:11"/>
him worthy of death, they made him
(poore man) eate that wordes (iudge
as he was) and told hym, if hee let
Christ liue and woulde not proceade
to condemne him he was not the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peroures
frende. This hath bene al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
the pleadinge of the Satany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
cleargy euen sithens that wicked
see of Rome falsely chalenged supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macye,
euen to put the princes and
iudges of the earth in the headde that
all true preachinge of Gods word a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainste
theyr wickednes, superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and ydolatry, was treason. But
all kinges, Quenes and magistrates
ciuile, shall at the daye of their death
aunswer with eternall dampnation
of their soules, for the sheading of all
innocent bloud wythin their realms
and offices. God doeth not bydde the
kyng and Quene commit matters of
religion to the bishops, neither doeth
he wyl them to geue byshops power
to condempne when they lust, and so
afterwards commit such as thei haue
condempned to the secular powers:
but doeth commaunde all princes to
<pb facs="tcp:22875:12"/>
be learned them selues,<note place="margin">Deu. 17.</note> to hear them
and to iudge them selues such doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sull
and weighty causes by the word
of God.<note place="margin">Iosu. 1.</note> It is bothe againste Goddes
lawes and mans,<note place="margin">Psal. 11.</note> that the bishoppes
and cleargy should be iudges ouer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
subiecte within this realme. For
it is no part of their office. They can
do no more but preach Goddes word
and minister Gods sacramentes, and
excommunicate such as Gods lawes
do pronounce worthye to be excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated.
Who wold geue a sword
in to a madde mans hand? There be
not liuinge more malicious, cruell,
craste, dyuelishe nor tyrannicall ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rauntes,
more mercilesse, then the
bishops and cleagye vnder that wyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
bishop of Rome: as the cromcles
and the histories of the bishops liues
do plainly record. And no meruayle:
for as the bishop of Wincher sayeth
in his bake of true obedience: where
so euer the Pope hathe supremacye,
there Christ is dishonoured: and the
kinges suffer wronge. Yea he sayeth
more (let his boke be iudge) that ther
<pb facs="tcp:22875:12"/>
can be no truthe where as the bishop
of Rome is chiefe heade. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he saieth that no prince canne or
may geue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pope any such autority.
For a king canne no more geue that
parte of his office that toucheth the
gouernaunce of the one parte of hys
people whiche is the cleargye, for
matters of relygion to the bishoppes
of Rome: then a wyfe maye geeue
the vse of her bodye frome her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande
too an other manne. Yet as
Saynte Iohn sayeth, the princes of
the earthe shall be made so droncken
with the cuppe of that whore of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,
that they wyll deliuer their
power to the beaste: but yet Saynte
Iohn sayeth playnelye, althoughe
the kinges doe geue too the beaste a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainste
Goddes lawes theyr kynge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
yet bee they none of the bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes.</p>
            <p>But nowe the byshoppe of Wyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester
and the reast of hys fellowes
againste theyr othes, theyr sermons,
theyr preachinges their bokes, yea
their own knowledge and conscience
<pb facs="tcp:22875:13"/>
fall vnder that wicked and false pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensed
power agayne: and do make
him the headde of Christes churche,
whom they al be not able to proue to
be anye member of Christes churche.
Graunte it wer as true as it is false
that Christ hadde geuen suche supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macye
to Saint Peter (who they say
was bishop of Rome although I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
knewe man yet able to proue it)
and his successoures, yet no manne
shoulde obey the thinges done by the
Pope, For the word of God is plain
that he is an excommunicate person
in that he teacheth doctryne besydes
and contrary to the worde of of God.
As Saint Paule sayth plainly. And
how farre both the doctrine and the
vse of the sacraments vnder the tira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye
of the bishop of Rome, be from
the word of God, it shal appear plain<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly to all the estates of this realme, if
my Lorde Cardinall of his charitye
wyll accomplish the reasonable and
gentyll requestes that I haue made
vnto him, I trust as gently he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
my letters: so <unclear>he</unclear> wyl graunt me
<pb facs="tcp:22875:13"/>
and my fellowes that be in duraunce
oure lawfull requests. But this I do
wryte (good reader) not to make dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of any matter, but only for the
maiestye and honour of Gods word,
to declare mine innocency of treason
or anye euyll wyll or malyce that I
beare to the Quenes highnes or any
superiour power. Doubtles I thank
our heauenlye father I haue reade to
many times the word of life and mar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ked
it to well, to fyghte agaynst or
curse the magistrates. I praye God
to geue them vnderstandinge of hys
holy truth, wyth loue to followe it:
and the harme that I woulde to any
man liuing happen to my selfe. For
the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mauudement of God is that we
should not only loue our frends,<note place="margin">Mat. 5.</note> but
also our enemies. And not only wish
good and pray for our frends as det<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours
vnto God and them for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites
we take at their hands, but
also praye for our ennemies, lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge
the tirannye and wickednes of
synne that causeth them too hate and
persecute whome God requireth to
<pb facs="tcp:22875:14"/>
loue.<note place="margin">1 Ioa. 5.</note> Yet doeth Saynte Iohn in his
Epistel commaund the readers ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
to beware they praye not for such
as be subiecte to the synne whiche is
to death. But I suppose that in these
late dayes, wherein the spirite of
iudgement and discreation or discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of sins, is not so abundantly in
men as it was in his time: no man
shoulde withoute a speciall testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye
of the holye ghost, particularlye
or expresselye iudge that synne to be
in anye man. For the iudgementes
of God, who shall tourne from wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse,
or who shall fall from ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue,
before this mortall life be ended,
be not reueyled nor knowen vntoo
<unclear>menne</unclear>. And yet in case I knewe (as
saint Iohn saieth) a man that synned
vnto death, for whome by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundemente
of God I shoulde not
pray: it foloweth not that I shoulde
curse him for whom I may not pray.
And I reioyce y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the inscrutable iudge

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
me with that euil that of al others
I haue ben all my life time (I thanke

I preached hys word to rebuke syn.</p>
            <p>I do remember that Saynte Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine
in his booke of Christes ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
in the mounte, hathe manye
Godlye sentences and sayinges in
this matter. But I mynde not to
write a boke of it but only to speake
the truth of my self agaynst wycked
sklaunderers, that care not so they
maye hurte, how they hurte, nor so
they kyll by what meanes they kyll.</p>
            <p>In the psalmes and in the prophets
he maruelous execrations of the wic<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ked,
and speciallye agaynste suche
as wyth the death of the Godlye <unclear>god</unclear>
aboute to condempne the woorde of

and his Apostels vsed maruelous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecrations,
when he sayed, woo be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

            <p>Saint Paul wyshed them destroied

<pb facs="tcp:22875:15"/>
Also he called the high priest

            </p>
            <p>These thinges declare that there
were at all tymes cursings vsed, and
extreame punishment followed such
as were by Gods commaundemente
cursed: and yet suche as did curse re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned
styll in the fauour of God.</p>
            <p>But these examples no priuate
man may folow, for these men were
publike preachers of Goddes word,
whose office was by all meanes so to
rebuke and condempne sinne, as thes
were instructed by the word of God.
And he that marketh the condicion
of these persons, shall perceaue that
in euerye one of them was two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons:
thone publik that could speake
no more pleasaunte nor gentlye to
<pb facs="tcp:22875:15"/>
the sinful world then God bad them:
whiche was to pronounce them cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
and damned for their sinnes and
iniqutye: yet as priuate menne they
wepte and sorowfullye lamented the
miserye and losse of the same persons
that they cursed as publik ministers.</p>
            <p>Ieremye as a publike preacher,<note place="margin">Iere. 5. 6.</note>
threatned the destruction of his own
countrey, the captiuitye of his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
prince and kinge, and the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitude
and bondage of al his cuntre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men:
yet as a priuate manne wept
and cried out rather with floudes of<note place="margin">Tren. 1. 2.</note>
tears then with droppes of weping.
So did Christ vpon Ierusalem,<note place="margin">Mat. 23. 2. regu. 18.</note> Da<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uid
vppon Saule and Absolon, and

God require of publike mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
to doe that appartamethe to

yet he taketh not frome them his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall

euen such as they knowe most iustly
to be punished: but yet so in measure
<pb facs="tcp:22875:16"/>
that the affection of mercy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion

and medle no further. But nowe the
bishops haue learned Gods <unclear>worde</unclear>
and preache and teache fables and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es:
and who so wyl not beleue them
in suche wickednes, they strike them
<pb facs="tcp:22875:17"/>
with losse of goodes, landes, liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
frendes, wyfe and children, yea
with imprisonmente, swearde fire,
coarde and suche like. And to make
all appeare wel, they strike true men
with the false slaunder of treasonne.
But such is Goddes iuste punishe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente
for oure synnes, most iustelye
happened vnto vs. When we amend
oure lyues he wyll withdrawe hys
scourge. Thus maist thou see (gentle
reader) that suche cursinge as theese
vngodlye papistes slaunder me wyth
all, is bothe againste my knowledge
and my doyinges. And as I knowe
I shoulde not curse any man: euen so
I knowe I should praye for all men,
and for mine ennemies also diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
and Chirstianly: for geuyng them
as much as lyeth in me here and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God: prayinge him to send them
more grace and louing charity.</p>
            <p>But here I woulde men shoulde
note and marke that as they be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bydde
to curse the magistrates, so be
they forbyd to saye, allowe, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
anye thinge they shall do that
<pb facs="tcp:22875:18"/>
is not agreeable with the woorde of
God. For the scripture doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
curse such as make wicked lawes,
but also holdeth them accursed (what<note place="margin">Isa. 5.</note>
so euer they be) that call good euyll
and euyl good.</p>
            <p>And althoughe God doeth require
me to obey the magistrate yet he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byddeth
me to flatter the magistrate,
eyther styre him vp so do euyll, or so
commend the euyll, when it is done.
For we know not onely euyll doers
shall be damned but also such as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sente
to euyll doinge. And this olde
sayinge is true,<note place="margin">Rom. 2.</note> the consenters and
docrs shall haue like paine.</p>
            <p>Now <unclear>these</unclear> be the bees and stinging
waspes that make the bishops so sore
too rage and startle. They haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the worde of God from the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
out of all churches in this realm,
that nothinge maye bee sayed in the
<unclear>vulgare</unclear> tonge: which is cleane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarye
to the woorde of God and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressely
against the same, as sainte
Paule sayeth.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 14.</note> But they saye saynte
Paul ther speaketh but of preaching
<pb facs="tcp:22875:18"/>
alone, whiche shoulde be in the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gare
tonge. But I saye and wyll iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
it, that they saye vntruely in so
sayinge, for the texte plainly and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presselye
maketh as well mension of
praier said or song, as of preaching.
I wyll pray in my spirit and in mine
vnderstrndinge saith sainte Paul. &amp;c.
And so do the olde fathers altogether
say as I say. Read Iohn Chrisostom
and S Ambrose vpon thesame place.</p>
            <p>Further, they haue banished the
holye supper of the Lorde, and call
the table wher the communion was
vsed, an oyster borde, and the breade
appointed to that vse, oyster bread:
and yet those thinges bothe by name
and effecte, be conteined &amp; commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
vs moste plainely by the expresse
word of god, And for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> supper of the
Lorde, they haue brought in priuate
masses of their owne, or elles of their
wicked predecessours inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion: why<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
is clene co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word of god:
let the boke of the Apostles and<note place="margin">Mat. 26. Mar. 14, Luc. 22.</note> euan
gelistes be iudge. And who so euer
wyll compare the masse (as they vse
<pb facs="tcp:22875:19"/>
it) with the supper of the Lorde: shal
see them as wel agree as Christ and
the wicked Phariseis agreed. Nowe
because men can not condescende vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
these wicked things, and call that
holy whiche is dampnable, and that
good which is euil: Therfore be lies,
slaunders, and false matters picked &amp;
fayned against them. But if they wil
saye good is euyll and euyll good, the
deuyll God and God the deuyll: then
shall men haue peace with them and
not before.</p>
            <p>As I am sorye with all my <unclear>harte</unclear>,
that anye manne for troubles should
curse hys persecutors, except he haue
more speciall testimony of Gods spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
that he doth well then I haue: so
I like wise I doe lamente that those
menne that be cursed (who they be I
knowe not) do not examine them sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues
and search their own consciences
whether iustlye God stirreth the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to hate them or no, as Dauid did
beinge a lauful king and also a good
king. When Semei called him bloud
sucker and murtherer, with manye
<pb facs="tcp:22875:19"/>
foule words: he entred into y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his owne conscyence and felt
that the Lorde hadde stirred the same
wicked man vp, beinge his own sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecte
to curse. Whereby he learned
(good kinge) to lamente and beware
of the sinne that made him thus to be
cursed. Alas what manne or woman
liuinge is there that one wayes or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hathe not deserued to be cursed
both of God and man. But these car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
and fleshly bishops neuer consy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that whiche is principallye to be
taken hede of in euery plage that god
sendeth: which is the sinne in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
plaged.</p>
            <p>When the scourge of God so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth,
it were best for euery man too
say to him selfe: good Lord although
I haue not deserued thus to be spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of one way, yet an other way I haue,
for none is pure and innocent in thy
sighte. Let euery manne remoue by
grace the cause of cursings and other
troubles, whych be the very messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
of God and his scourges: and
then God wyll remoue the effectes,
<pb facs="tcp:22875:20"/>
whiche be the troubles them selues.
If the party cursed by manne be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocente:<note place="margin">Mat. 5.</note>
he maye reioyce to be euyll
spoken of for iustice sake, and assure
hym selfe that God wyll blesse that
man curseth.<note place="margin">Mal. 2.</note> If he be gilty, the curse
is as a preacher sente vnto him from
God to admonishe him of his sinnes.
And as for the person that curseth, if
Gods spirite beare not recorde with
his spirit that he did it for Gods sake
and the hatred he did beare onely to
sinne, and styrred thereunto by <unclear>the</unclear>
spirite of God, as the prophetes and
Apostels were: he hath greate cause
to lament. For the curse that he wold
to others shall lyght vpon him selfe.
And suche offendours had most nede
of coumforte, to call them againe to
God and to the order of charitye: for
that we be bounde to do as the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of God doeth teache. Not too
coumforte them or ayde them (as my
false accusers saye of mee) as tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toures
in treason, but as creatures
made vntoo the symilytude of God,
<pb facs="tcp:22875:20"/>
fallen in too synne. The whiche si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milytude
and dignity of God in man
shoulde not be abhorred nor detested
for anye cryme that manne commyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,
but rather pittyed and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
not leafte alone, as the manner
of the worlde is at this presente: but
diligentlye sought and laboured for,
as Christe dyd for the loste sheepe,
who did not onely seeke for it but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
caryed it home vppon his owne
shoulders when he had founde it.</p>
            <p>Thus haue I spoken and witten
(gentle reader) againste the papistes
proceadinges, as it is my bounden
dewtye, and all mennes elles that
feare God. For I am sworne by the
terryble, venerable, holye, and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
name of God, as I truste too be
saued by the ryches, treasure and
meryties of Christes deathe: nother
dyrectelye nor indyrectelye too agree
vntoo the wycked and <unclear>pretensed</unclear> su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacye
of the Bishoppe of Rome:
but with all my wytte, learning and
other meanes resyst him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:22875:21"/>
This othe (by Gods helpe) I wyll
not violate break: let the wicked per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sured
men, that he the wicked popes
adherentes, saye what they wyll, and
do what God shall permitte them. I
feare not deathe, nor passe of their
cruell imprisonment, which is more
vile and cruell towards vs true men,
then euer it was against murtherers
traytoures, and theues. But that is
no now thing. For there is no offence
irremissible with the popishe bishops
but to beleue trulye in Christ, as his
word teacheth. Cipriane in a sermon
<hi>de mortalitate,</hi> hath these words <hi>eius est
mortem timere qui ad Christum nolit ire,</hi> he
feareth death y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wold not go to christ.
But we desire and grone too be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this wicked life and world
if it please God. How be it we wyll
not gladlye prouoke enmitye nor yet
suffer vnprofitable persecution: but
when the glorye of God shall perishe
withoute the truth be testifyed: I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fye
all tormentes and tormentours.
And let al good men and women re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce
also in Christe, for doubtelesse
<pb facs="tcp:22875:21"/>
the churche of Christ was first plan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted
vnder the gospell by the deathe of
Christ and his poore seruaunts: and
nowe it shall take no more harme by
the persecution of the Satanicall pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes,
then golde taketh by the gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smythes
fornace. There is no deathe
canne come to the creature withoute
Goddes good leaue and permission.
Therefore let vs reioyce that oure
tyme draweth so nere to go from this
ruinous and decayed cytye and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle
of oure bodyes: for there is
an euerlastynge mansion in heauen
prepared for vs. And whyles we doo
liue let vs pray to god for this our na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>turall
countrey. For where as before
it was cursed but by wicked manne
the Antichriste of Rome: nowe is it
cursed of God. And where as before
it was interdicted but by a false wret<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che
that would be Christes vicare in
earthe: nowe is it interdicted by the
maker and creatour of al the earth:
as the woord of God doeth shew vs,
and all the olde counsayles and doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toures.
Besydes that loke vppon the

Bishops boke, Winchesters oration,
