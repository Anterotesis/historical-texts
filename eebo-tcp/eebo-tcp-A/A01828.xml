            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Of theſe .iii. ſpyes one was well lerned and very expert in

To theym ſhe gaue here letters of commendacyon dyrected to the hed ruler of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uynce, vnder the domynyon of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whoſe powre ſtretcheth to Mazua and the ſee of Araby, to pray hym to helpe them as ſecretely as he coulde with all ſuch thynges as they ſhold nede, makyng as though they were marchau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t men which came the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for marchaundyſe. This ruler (and who ſo euer happeneth to be in that offyce) is called in the Ebeſſyne tonge Baruagays. This Mathewe and his companyon the Ebyſſyne; through the letters of commendacy. on they had, were loui<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gly welcomed, where as they made mery a certayne ſpace, neuer tellynge no man theyre purpoſe, neyther what he wolde do there, or where when he thens depar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted he wolde become. But (to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:17184:24"/>
he myght brynge his purpoſe to paſſe wyth leſſe parell) fayned hym ſelfe a lether byer, and in the meane ſeaſon now and then bought certayn preſents whych pryuyly he ſent vnto quene Ellyn. And vnder this cloke, peruſed dyuers prouynces, menyng this, that eſcapynge ſaufe wythout hurte, through enmyes of the Portin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gales, at laſt myght come to Portyn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gale yt ſelfe, and ſo there do the thyn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges he come for. For other way then this was there not. Alwaye whether ſo euer he went or where ſo euer he became, he toke with hym this yonge man his felowe the Ebyſſyne, le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uynge all his hole houſholde at Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quyke, whyche is a cytty nere the ſee coſte, appertaynyng to preſter Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, dyſtant about a myle from the yle of Mazua. wherin that Baruagais be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore named then abode. For it is euer the abydynge place of that offycer.</p>
               <p>But nowe yf percaſe any capcy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous felowe wolde obiecte why of ſo many noble men, as there is no dout but there be in ſo great a court as pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſter Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s is, there were not ſent in
<pb facs="tcp:17184:25"/>
that embaſſate, ſome oldermen, men of more grauyte, of greater experye<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and byſydes this Ebyſſyns borne, whyche myght haue borne a greater porte and maieſte before our prynce rather then theſe, of whome the one was farre frome the nobilyte ether of an Ebyſſyne or Indyane eyther, bycauſe beyng an Armenycane / and the other all though he was an Ebyſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſyne and in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kynges court brought vppe, yet but a yonge man, an wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oute the company waytyng on hym y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> becometh a prynces embaſſatour to haue / and therby ſheweth not the dygnyte of a legate. But hereof may there be two cauſes alledged.</p>
               <p>The fyrſte, in all thoſe regyons (as great as they be) from the ſee of Araby, to the water of Gange, there be but two languages, that is to wit, Perſyke and Arabyke. whyche lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages who ſo perfytely knoweth, may eaſely paſſe thorough all thoſe prouynces. Nowe in Preſter Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s courte be there very fewe or none no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, Ebyſſyns borne, that can ſkyll of thoſe tonges. Fyrſte bycauſe they
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:17184:25"/>
haue lyttell co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany or acquayntau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce wyth the out borderars. Secondely for that yt ſeldome cauſeth theym to go out of theyr owne countrey, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge contente wyth theyre countrey lawes. And for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> cauſe the ſame Ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thew, ſkylled in both the tonges and in all the prouynces there about, for he hadde ofte ben in them / and ſeyng that at that tyme, all though he were an Armenyane, yet he was of the que<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nys counſayll, and very great about her, he was thoughte the metyſt for that meſſage / namely ſyns he hadde one ioyned wyth hym an Ebyſſyne borne, whyche both knewe the ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and maners of many nacyons / ſo that yf nede ſhold requyre, he were mete to be ſent on a lyke embaſſat.</p>
               <p>The ſeconde cauſe is. The actes of warre of the Portyngales done wyth the Indyans, agaynſt the Tur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kes or Perſyes at that tyme was not ſo well knowen of the Ebyſſyns, that they thought it nedefull to ve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ter any old noble Ebyſſyne, &amp; ſpecyally ſyns they were vnexperte in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tonges, in ſo farre and ſo dyffyculte a vyage, tyll
<pb facs="tcp:17184:26"/>
tyme they were farther certyfyed by ſome other. And therfore pleaſed to ſende that Mathew, an Armenycane borne, as moſte meate for that beſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes whyche not greatly acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panyed, but as a marchaunt ſholde go and eſpye al to gether. And that it ſo was ment, the mater ſelfe ſhewed. For af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ones all was exactely tryed by hym, there was then a nother embaſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſatour ſent, both an old man, a noble man, an Ebiſſyne borne, and a preſte, connyng both in ſcrypture and Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day / on whome wayted a very great company of nobles of the Ebyſſyns, of themperours p<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſter Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s courte. And this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was ſent vnto the moſt myghty pri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce one Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thyrd king of Portyngale. For Emanuel that was his father departed almoſt .x. ye<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>res ago. This legate wyth all his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pany at this preſent day is wyth our kynge, myche made on, and hadde in great reuerence. whome queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyonleſſe they wold neuer haue ſent, hadde they not ben afore ſurely certy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fyed of our maters by Mathew. But now we be a littell degreſſed therfore
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:17184:26"/>
let vs agayn returne to our purpoſe. This Mathew then vnder the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texte of fayned marchaundyſe, after his beynge at many other cytyes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorted to Aden / whych is a cytye by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſee of Arabye vnder the Turkes do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mynyon, byelded euen as our cytyes be, very ryche, and very well fenſyd wyth fortreſſes. where after he hadde falle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in ſome familiare acqueyntau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce wyth certayne marchaunt men, and hadde ſerched all thynge to the vtter moſte, and fynyſhed the maters he came for, makynge hym ſelfe euer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Turkes a Turke, for other wyſe coulde he neuer haue eſcaped &amp; done his beſyneſſe ſaufe without dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ger, he returned to Arquique where before he had left his houſhold wyth his companyon the Ebyſſyne, &amp; thus he remoued, toke his houſhold again and ſo retourned to Aden, hopynge that from thens he myght ſayle wyth his warys and his houſholde to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia. For why at the towne of Aden they are wonte to take ſhippynge to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde India. where when he was landed he ſold al his lether &amp; bought
<pb facs="tcp:17184:27"/>
other marchandyſe of Alexandrye to cary wyth hym to Indy, by whych he muſte nedes paſſe into Portyngale.</p>
               <p>Now was a ſhyppe redy goynge to Inde, and he redy wyth all his mar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>chandyſe to go wyth that ſhyppe, whyle there ſpronge a certayne ſuſpy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cyon amonges the cetezyns of Aden, that he ſholde be a ſpye. wheruppon he was taryed and let that he coulde not take paſſage at that ſeaſon. But he as one of a great wyt and expery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſo clerely purged hym ſelfe of that ſuſpycyon, prouynge in dede he was a marchau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t man, and that there he ſoughte nothynge but marchaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyſe, that they gaue hym wyth hys houſholde free paſporte, to departe whether hym pleaſed. But now then beynge dyſmyſſed / he founde neuer a veſſel goynge toward Inde. Then he was fayn to hyer one, &amp; ſo he with all his company toke ſhyppyng, and came towarde Inde, to a certayn no<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble ryche cytye called Xaer. whych is dyſtant from Aden about a hundred myle, where lykewyſe he founde no ſhyppes goynge to Inde, bycauſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:17184:27"/>
nowe yt was wynter, whyche there begynneth in Marche. And whyle yt laſteth no man may ſaile toward In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, for the great ſtormes of wynde (whyche is a meruaylous thynge) y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> contynually blows contrary oute of one quarter. But when the ſees ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued hym, he ſayled from the cytye of Xaer vnto a towne called Fartaque, there in euery place faynynge hym ſelfe a marchaunt of Turkey. From whens he wente to a place called the inhabitours of Dabul / &amp; from thens to departe to the town of Goa. where the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wyntered the gret Alfonſus Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bubarque a Portyngale, the chyefe capytayne of all India, predeceſſour vnto Lupus Soarez, whom we haue made mencyon of byfore, whych was he y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſubdewed al that ſame Inde, Ara<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>by, Perſe, Malach, and the hole ſee of Ganges, and made all them ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes to Portyngale. Dabull is dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from Fartaque, whych is in the coſt of Inde .iiii. hundred myle, from Goa .xl. fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Dio .iii. ſcore great myle. Dio is a very ryche cytye, vnder the domynyon of Cambaie very well fen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſed,
<pb facs="tcp:17184:28"/>
wyth gonnes and ſuche other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gens of warre, and very well walled.</p>
               <p>Furthermore he taried at Dabul from May to Dece<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, and there oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied hym ſelfe about marchau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dyſe becauſe in all that tyme he could not take ſhyppynge. At laſte he gate hym a ſmale veſſell, and beganne to gete hym away. And by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reaſon he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed certayn of his frendes &amp; the mayſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the ſhyppe that he wolde go vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to Portyngale wyth his marchaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyſe, by and by yt was ſhewed to cer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tayne hed offycers of the towne, that there was a ſtraunger one vnknowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whyche pryuyly wolde conuey hym ſelfe to Portyngale. wheruppon wot<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tynge neuer what they ſhuld thynke of the mater, they kept him ſtyll with fayre wordes, and ſo let hym of hys paſſage for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſeaſon. After he ſaw this incontyne<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t by certayn marchau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t men whych were wonte to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſant in Inde with the Portyngales, whyche he before hadde made hys frendes, he wrote ſecretely vnto the capy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne Alfonſus Dalbuberque, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifyeng hym as dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly as he could
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:17184:28"/>
how it ſtode with him. He as ſoone as he knew it ſent thither certain ſhyppꝭ and galleys ſome great ſome ſmale vnto hym. Silueſter Corzo was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ca<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pitayn of them, where whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was ar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ryued, ſtrayt way he ſhewed the offy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the town that he was ſent vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great duke Alfonſus Dulbuberque to ſeke a certayn mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunt man whyche he muſte nedes ſpeke wyth all, &amp; that the ſame Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew was he whom he ſought / which knowen they gaue hym leue to ſpeke wyth hym and ſo delyuered hym into his handes. For this cauſe the Dabu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lenſes vſed this liberalyte towarde hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for fere they ſhold ſeme our ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eni<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>myes, for as mych as they take mych profyte by our Portyngales whyche vſe Goa &amp; Inde, &amp; yet in place &amp; time whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the may, ſecretly do vs diſpleaſe. This Mathew then co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uayde fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the citie of Dabull, cam with this noble yong man y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Ebyſſyne his felow, &amp; al his famyly, at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> laſt to Goa, where as we before recyted, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> noble capytayne Alfonſus then wintered wyth a gret number bothe of people &amp; nobles of

For ſo they fere they ſhall leſe a great parte of theyre pollynge and pyllynge and theyr accuſtomed raue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous roberye, thorough the whyche they pytyfully oppreſſe with inſacya<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble auaryce thoſe ſylly pore innocent people. And therfore I deſyred you then (&amp; yet agayne in Chryſtes name do) and that not I alone, but alſo as many as thynke as I do, that ſyns yt is your offyce (as beynge theyre herdman, and they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mytted to you by god) you wold cauſe thoſe nobles of yours, to leue theyr couetous cruel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tye, and ſo in concluſyon to brynge thoſe ſymple ſoules to the knowlege of Cryſte, and ſo payenge theyr dew trybutes to theyr kynges, as other cryſten people do to theyre prynces.

Let thoſe nobles of yours take hede therfore what they do, that they com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pell not ſo great a folde of ſhepe in tyme to come, in the preſence of that iuſte iudge Ieſu Cryſte, to axe iudge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment of that tyranny of theyrs.
