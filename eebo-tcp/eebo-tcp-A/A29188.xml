            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>COnsidering how convenient and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial little Books are for such as cannot reach the Price of bigger; I here present you with an Explication of the <hi>Creed, Lord's-Prayer,</hi> and <hi>Ten Commandments,</hi> as small as the Subject will permit: And being that (in my Iudgment) the <hi>Creed</hi> cannot be better or shorter Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phras'd
<pb facs="tcp:32456:3"/>
than the most Learned and Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Prelate Dr. <hi>Pearson</hi> has done it; I have transcribed mine from thence, that those most sound and necessary Truths might not be confined to those alone who are able to purchase that most Learned Work. And that the meanest capacity might not lose the Knowledge of such a safe and wholesome Exposition; I have changed the more Eloquent and Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult Words, for such as are more Plain and Obvious. The <hi>Lord's-Prayer</hi> is the same in Substance that I delivered to you Three Years ago, when I Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chized the Children; which I have now Expounded in the <hi>Form of a Prayer,</hi> that the <hi>Poor Man</hi> may upon any pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing occasion, know how to Express him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self at large upon any Petition. The Precepts of the first Table, you know I Expounded to you all the last <hi>Summer</hi>
till <hi>Advent;</hi> the Heads of which (ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Points in Controversy) I here present you with: And those of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond I shall in due time Treat of, if God prosper my Studies; in the mean
<pb facs="tcp:32456:3"/>
while (to compleat the Exposition) I here give you the Substance of them. And being that in several Discourses immediately after <hi>Christmas</hi> last, I did press the necessity of a daily Service to God from the Words of <hi>Zacharias, Luk. 1.74,</hi> &amp; <hi>75.</hi> I have added a short <hi>Morning</hi> and <hi>Evening Form</hi> to be used before and after your daily Work, A Prayer against the Temptation of the Flesh, to any particular Sin, to keep your Bodies in subjection to your Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. Another for your use in the time of Sickness. And when at other times you shall have particular occasion for other Services, I have given a short Direction where to be furnished in the Psalms. And this I did, not to hinder any that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from buying Books of more peculiar use, but to comply with the necessities of those that are not; of which I am very sensible there is too great a number. I had no other inducement to meddle with this, but my Charity to the Souls of the Poor, for whom Christ died as well as for the Rich: And if hereby I shall
<pb facs="tcp:32456:4"/>
gain but one Soul, I shall thank God for making me an Instrument of so much good: And if none be better'd by it, yet I have this satisfaction, that I have endeavoured for God's sake, and your own, to shew my self</p>

                  <hi>I</hi> Believe in God the Father Almighty, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of Heaven and Earth: And in Iesus Christ his only Son our Lord, who was Conceived by the Holy Ghost, Born of the Uirgin <hi>Mary,</hi> Suffered under Pontius Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, was Crucified, Dead and Buried, He descended into Hell; the third day he rose again from the Dead, he ascended into Heaven, and sitteth at the right hand of God the Father Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty; from thence he shall come to judge the Quick and the Dead.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:32456:5"/>I believe in the Holy Ghost; the Holy Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church; the Communion of Saints; the Forgiveness of Sins; the Resurrection of the Body, and the Life everlasting. <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <div n="1" type="article">
               <head>Article I. I believe in God the Father Almighty, Maker of Heaven and Earth.</head>
               <p>ALthough these Articles of my Faith which are contained in the Creed, are not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent to my sense, though they are not of themselves evident to my understanding, nor appear true to me by any Natural or Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary Cause; yet being they are contained in the Scriptures, the Writings of the Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Apostles and Prophets; being that those Apostles and Prophets were Endued with miraculous Power from above, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately inspired by the Holy Ghost, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently, what they delivered, was the Word of <hi>GOD,</hi> and not of Man; being that <hi>GOD</hi> is of such universal Holiness, and infinite Wisdom, that it is impossible he should be deceived; of that perfect Holiness, that it is not imaginable he should intend to deceive me; and consequently, what he has delivered for a Truth, must be necessarily
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:32456:5"/>
and infallibly true. I readily and stedfastly assent unto them, as most certain Truths, and am fully and absolutely, and more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernedly perswaded of them, than of any thing I see and know. And because that God who has reveal'd them, has done it not for my benefit alone, but for the advantage of others; nor for that alone, but also for the Manifestation of his own Glory, being that for these Ends he has Commanded me to profess them, and hath promised an Eternal Redemption upon my Profession of them; being that every particular person is to expect the Justification of himself, and the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Soul, upon the Condition of his own Faith: As with a certain and full per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion I assent unto them, so with a fixed and undaunted Resolution I will profess them, and with this Faith in my Heart, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession in my Mouth, to the whole body of the Creed, and to every Article and Part of it, I sincerely, readily, and resolvedly say, <hi>I believe.</hi>

               <div type="section">
                  <head>I believe in God.</head>
                  <p>Forasmuch as the Eternal Power and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head is made known by all the things that are Created, and the dependency of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures proves, That there must be an infinite
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:32456:6"/>
Being that depends on nothing; whereas all things are made for some End, and all their Operations are directed to it, though they cannot understand the Reason why they are, and why they work; therefore both their Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation and their Work must be guided by some Universal and Over-ruling Wisdom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Seeing that God is not only revealed in his Creatures, but has frequently declar'd his Deity by most infallible Predictions, and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural Operations; therefore I freely acknowledge, clearly profess, and fully Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that there is a God.</p>
                  <p>Again, seeing that there is one Being that depends upon nothing, that does suppose that all other Beings must depend upon it; seeing that the intire Fountain of all Perfections cannot have a double Head, and the most perfect Order of the World declares the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Dominion of one absolute Lord; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Account I believe, that God is but one: And that there neither is, nor can be any more. And thus <hi>I believe in God.</hi>

                  <p>I believe that this one God is the Father of all things, of Men and Angels, because they are his Off spring by Creation, and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:32456:6"/>
that he is in a more peculiar manner, the Father of all those whom he regenerates by his Spirit, whom he adopteth in his Son as Heirs and Co-heirs with him; whom he crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with the Reward of an eternal Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in the Heavens. But far above all this, besides his general Off-spring and peculiar People to whom he hath given power to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Sons of God, I believe him in a more eminent manner, to be the Father of one singular and proper Son, his own, his beloved, his only begotten Son; whom he hath not only begotten of the Blessed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, by the coming of the Holy Ghost, and the over-shadowing of his Power; not only sent with special Authority, as the King of <hi>Israel</hi>; not only raised from the Dead, and made Heir of all things in his House; but before, and in order to all this, hath begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten him from all eternity in the same Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Majesty with Himself, whereby I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him to be always a Father as much as always a God. And in this Relation I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, That as he is the Original Cause of all things, because they were Created by him, so he is the Fountain of the Son begotten by him, and of the Holy Ghost proceeding from him.</p>

                  <head>Almighty.</head>
                  <p>I believe, that this Father is not subject to the Infirmities of Age, and that there is no weakness attending the Ancient of days; but on the contrary, I believe that Omnipotency is part of the Being of the God-head; and that thereby he has not only power to work or do any thing, but Authority; and an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Right, both of making what, when, and how he pleaseth, and of possessing whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he makes; and of using and disposing all things which he thus possesseth. I believe that this power is most absolute, because he that has it, depends upon none, neither is he to give any account for the Use and Exercise of it; that it is infinite for largeness, as being a power over all things, without exception; that it is full and perfect, as being over e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing without limitation; to be Eternal, as having neither Beginning nor End.</p>

                  <p>I believe, that both Heaven and Earth, and all things contained in them, have not their Being of themselves, but were made in the beginning; that there was nothing at first but God, who produced most part of this
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:32456:7"/>
World out of nothing, and the rest out of that which was formerly made out of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. This I believe was done by the most free and voluntary Act of the Will of God, of which no Reason or Motive can be given, but his Goodness.

               <head>God spake these Words, and said, I am the Lord thy God.</head>
               <p>I Am here assur'd, that the Lord my God is the Author of all these Laws; and that I may gather from their duration, from the trouble of my Conscience, when I break them, and from the Purity of the Laws them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. I am sure that he has Power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire my Obedience to these Laws, and therefore I ought in duty to observe them; that he has all Justice (as my Lord) to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish me if I transgress them, and all Love (as my God) to reward me if I keep them; and therefore, the Fear of his Anger, and the Hope of his sweet Love, should make me obedient to them. O Lord, give me Grace
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:32456:19"/>
and Strength to do what thou Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, and then Command me what thou wilt.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="order">
               <head>The Order of the Precepts.</head>
               <p>THese Laws are divided into Two Tables. One tells me my Duty towards God, and the other my Duty towards Man. Now it is but Reason (as well as my Saviour's Precept) that my Duty towards God, should be set first. And as the first Precept that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to God, bids me worship him, and none but him, that made me; so the first Precept that concerns Man, is to respect him first that begat me. O God, without thy help, I am not able to keep the least Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, therefore I am bound to pray unto thee by the first, that thou maist give me Spiritual Power and Abilities to observe and keep the rest.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="1" type="commandment">
               <head>Commandment I. Thou shalt have none other Gods but me.</head>
               <p>THere is a God above, who influences all inferiour Beings; and this God is but one, and there is none besides him. And therefore I am bound, first,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:32456:19"/>To love him above all; and all other things that I love, must be beloved, either as they come from him, or as they are helpful to us, in performing our Duties to him. I may know whether I have this Love, or not, by examining whether I endeavour to keep his Commandments, whether I love to fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent his Ordinances, give Respect to his Embassadors, pity and help Christ's distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Lambs, and desiring the Company of none but good Men.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I am obliged by this Precept, to fear him above all, <hi>i. e.</hi> be afraid to offend or anger him; and this Fear should be indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by his Precepts, his Mercy, his Omnisci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, his Omnipresence, and the Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my own Weakness, and God's infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Protection: Such a Fear brings me Spiritual Wisdom, Protection, Blessing from God, Joy in my Soul, Pardon of my Sins past, and Grace to withstand Temptations, for the time to come.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I must pray to him, and to none but him; and this is a sign that I love and fear him. My Saviour has bid me serve him only, and God is jealous of his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. I must not say, O Saint, pray to my Father to help me; but, Our Father which art in Heaven, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If I be a peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Sinner, God has promised to hear me;
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:32456:20"/>
if I be impenitent, the Saints will not pray for me. To obtain God's Ear, I need no Spokes-man, but a Devout Mind. He alone can help me; he will help me when he sees fit; he knows the fittest time to help me in; my Prayers do certainly reach his Ears; he knows what I want better than I do; he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone corrects me, and I am sure he loves me.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, I must acknowledge him to be the sole Governour of all things in the World, and therefore I must trust in him. He gave me all that I have, and therefore I ought to be thankful to him.</p>
               <p>

And if these be so odious, to be sure, all deliberate Perjuries must be abundantly worse.

               <p>O Most Gracious and Loving Father, I the vilest of Sinners, do acknowledge mine Unworthyness, either to ask any thing of thee, or to appear before thee. For, O Lord, as I was conceived in Sin, and brought forth in Iniquity, so ever since, as thou hast
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:32456:26"/>
multiplyed the number of my days, I have encreased the measure of my sins, that if thou enter into Judgment with me, to me belongeth nothing but Shame and Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, both of Body and Soul; yet, O Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Father, since thy Loving Mercy hath granted me so long time of Repentance, and given thine only Son to suffer for me, and to reconcile me unto thee; Lord, grant that I may feel the Comfort of the one, and enjoy the Benefit of the other. And though my Heart is so hardned with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Custom of sinning, that I am not able to think a good Thought, much less, to turn heartily and penitently unto thee; yet I humbly beg of thee to lay before mine Eyes such a sight of my Sins, and such a Prospect of thy Judgments, that I, loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the former, and standing in awe of the latter, may be drawn unto thy Son Jesus Christ, who has most graciously pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised Rest and Refreshment to those that are heavy laden with the Conscience and Burden of their Sins. O Lord, I beseech thee accept the Death of thy Son, as suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Satisfaction for all my Sins; and grant, that I may feel the same effectually working in me a Death unto Sin, killing in me the Lusts of the Old <hi>Adam:</hi> Seal up in me the Truth of his Resurrection,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:32456:27"/>
by raising me up to the Life of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, that I may give my Soul and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy an holy, living, and acceptable Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice unto thee, which is but a reasonable Service. And because, that whilst I carry about me this earthly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Tabernacle, this bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Sin, my whole Life is nothing but a continual Rebellion against thee, I ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly implore such a Measure of thy good Spirit, as may work a Newness of Life in me, and drive away the darkness of my Understanding, that I may see the Way, wherein I ought to walk; subdue the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion of my Will, that it may submit to thy Commandments; and correct my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamed Affections, calling them from Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting after Vanities, to delight in thy Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies.

               <p>Furthermore, O Lord, I give thee most

hearty Thanks for all thy Benefits besto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed upon me from the beginning of my days to this present time; namely, that thou hast Elected me before the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the World were laid, Created me after thine own Image and Similitude, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed me by <hi>Iesus Christ</hi>'s Death and Resurrection, Sanctified me by the inward working of thy Holy Spirit, and in due and convenient Time, called me to the Knowledge of my Election, Creation, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption and Sanctification, by the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Gospel. O Lord, encrease these Blessings in me, and my Thankfulness for them, that I may grow from Vertue to Vertue, from Strength to Strength, from Faith to Faith, till I come to that perfect Age that thou hast appointed me to grow in <hi>Christ Iesus.</hi> I thank thee also, O my God, for all the temporal Blessings which thou hast bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon me; I have been cast upon thee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver since I was born, thou art my Portion, and the lifter up of my head: I have none in Heaven but thee, and there is none upon Earth that I desire, in comparison of thee: And now, O Lord, pardon the weakness of my thankfulness, and grant that the medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on these, and all other thy Benefits, may draw me to a true and hearty Repentance: Grant, that I seeing thee by so many, and

so great Testimonies to be my most dear and loving Father, may at length cease to be an obstinate and rebellious Child.</p>
               <p>And now (O God) having passed through the Works of this day, being that the Frailties of my Flesh must needs have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended thy Majesty, and I had fallen into most grievous sins, if thy Grace had not prevented me: I beseech thee, O Lord, let not the Sun go down upon thy wrath, but as the darkness of the Night covers the face of the Earth, so let my sins be hidden under the Veil of my Saviour's Flesh, and buried in his Death, that they never rise up again either here to shame me, or hereafter to damn me: That my Soul and Conscience being freed from the accusation of sin, may partake with my body in quiet rest. Let thy Gracious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, O God, watch over me for my Defence this Night; and make me remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that as I lay down my body to rest, so it shall be laid down in the Grave to be consumed to Earth from whence it was taken; that Meditation may drive from me all vain Dreams, all idle Fancies, and wicked Imaginations; that I may enjoy thine Ordinance of sleep soberly and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly for the refreshing of my weak body; and that I may rise again in the Morning

to serve thee in the station wherein thou hast placed me, walking always as becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a Child of Light, and as one that looks for the coming of my Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ: In whose Name, for these Mercies and what ever else thou knowest to be convenient for me, I humbly Pray as he in compassion of my infirmities, hath taught me saying,</p>

their Tents round about me. My Soul, O Lord, lieth as among Lions, hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gring and thirsting after my Blood, who have whet their Teeth and opened their Mouths to devour me. But thou, O God, who art of more Honour and Might, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake for my defence: Make haste, O God, to help me, and hide me under the shadow of thy Wings until that Tyranny be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-past. I am afraid of Satan, that sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile and old Serpent, with whom the World and the Flesh have conspired a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst me. They have enticed away my outward senses, and have won my corrupt affections, so that they fight against me with my own weapons.</p>
               <p>Whither then shall I flee for succour? The World is spread abroad like a Net to ensnare me, the flesh is an Iron Chain to bind me, and my senses and affections are confederate with sin to betray me; thus the Gates of Hell are prevailed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst me, and my sins have taken such hold upon me, that they say, <hi>Surely there is no help for him in his God.</hi> Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, I have lifted up mine Eyes unto the Hills, and will hope still in thy Salvation. Tho' the Serpent is subtile, yet the Son of God is Wisdom: Tho' the World does entice me, yet Heaven is my Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance:
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:32456:29"/>
Tho' the Flesh strives, yet in the Cross of Christ I shall overcome: Tho' mine Affections are unruly, yet his Death will tame them: And tho' Hell rage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst me, yet a stedfast and true Faith in Christ Jesus shall Triumph over it. Vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe, O God, that Faith unto thy Servant, that I may be enabled by the fellowship of his Death and Resurrection to Crucify the old Man and Mortify the whole body of sin. Make me strong, O God, in the Power of his Might, that all the days of my Life I may be defended from all adversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and (in the evil day, the day of my death) strengthned in the inner Man: That having finished my course, I may (with those that have overcome through the Blood of the Lamb) arrive at those Blessed Mansions that thou hast prepared for all those that fight the good fight of Faith. Grant that in the hopes of that, I may victoriously fight under my Saviour's Banner, against all the assaults of Sin, the World, and the Devil. Hear me, O Lord, in these my requests for Jesus Christ his sake, in whose Name and Words, I further Pray as he hath taught me saying,</p>

               <p>O Most Gracious &amp; Merciful Father, thou Lord of Life and Death; in whose hands is the power of Sickness and Health; Thou who woundest and healest whom thou wilt. Unto thee, O God, I commit my self, beseeching thee for thy love in Christ Jesus, to be merciful unto me: O my God, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess that I have many ways offended thee, and provoked thy wrath and indignation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst me; but as I have been disobedient, so now I return Penitent, and heartily Submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive. Remember, O Lord, that I am but dust; and let not thy Spirit strive with me, seeing thou hast promised that at what time soever a sinner does Repent from the bottom of his heart he shall live and not die: Fulfill this Gracious word unto thy servant, that the bones which thou hast broken, may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice. My Flesh, O Lord, drieth up, my Strength fails me, and my Life draweth near to an end; in all this thou art Just in chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my disobedience, and Merciful in not suffering me to run on any longer in the course of my sins; and without such Fatherly admonitions, how prone are we to forget thee! O Lord I am comforted when I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member

that thou lovest every Son whom thou Chastenest, and scourgest every Son whom thou dost receive; that when we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive correction, God dealeth with us as with sons, and if we be without it (whereof all are partakers) then we are bastards and not sons: Lord I believe all this, help thou mine unbelief; I see that <hi>Iob, Daniel, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah,</hi> and all thy holy Children have drunk of the cup; that thou hast made their bed easy in their sickness, and delivered their Souls out of trouble: I therefore hope, that as I am made partaker of their sufferings, I shall also be a partaker of their Comfort and Refreshing. O Lord, let the Meditation of these and such like examples be always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent with me, and make me firmly believe that I shall receive the like deliverance as they did. Add unto that Faith Patience, that I may quietly undergoe whatever thy hand shall lay upon me, and may receive this thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly chastisement with thanksgiving, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that though this outward man pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, yet the inward man shall be in the hands of its most faithful Creatour.
