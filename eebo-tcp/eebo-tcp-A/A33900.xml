            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE CASE Of the Two ABSOLVERS THAT Were Tryed at the <hi>Kings-Bench-Bar,</hi> at <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> on <hi>Thursday</hi> the 2d of <hi>Iuly</hi> 1696. For giving ABSOLUTION AT The place of EXECUTION TO Sir <hi>Iohn Friend</hi> and Sir <hi>William Parkens.</hi>
            </head>
            <p n="1">I. FOR a Minister of the Church of <hi>England</hi> to give Absolution to a dying Penitent, if he humbly and heartily desire it, is a lawful Act, as appears by the Rubrick in the Office <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>r the Visitation of the Sick; which is not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>m'd by, but a part of the Act of Uniformity.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:42008:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>II. There being no particular Office appointed in the Liturgy for Persons to be Executed (whose Souls are as precious, and as much to be taken care of, as the Souls of those who dye in their Beds) that for the Visitation of the Sick, which by parity of Reason is farely applicable to the case of Persons to be Executed, who are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd as dying Men must be used, or none at all in their Case; unless the Ministers officiating are left to the liberty of Extemporary Effusions, which rather become a Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistical Elder, than a Presbyter of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> And why is it not as justifiable to use the Office for the Visitation of the Sick in the Case of Persons to be Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, as to use the Prayer in that Office Publickly in Churches in behalf of the Sick, which are appointed by the Rubrick to be used in the sick Persons Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; for which only necessity, and a defect in the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy is pleaded?</p>
            <p n="3">III. The Circumstances of time and place and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny being entirely left by the Rubrick (where there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Command nor Prohibition concerning them) to the discretion and choice of the Ministers Absolving, and the Penitent to be Absolved; how could it be Criminal in the Absolvers of Sir <hi>I. F.</hi> and Sir <hi>W. P.</hi> to give them Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution with Imposition of Hands at the place of Execution, which they desir'd as a comfortable Support under the Terrors of Death, as a <hi>Viaticum</hi> in their Passage to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity?</p>
            <p n="4">IV. 'Tis entirely left to the Absolving Minister to judge of the Spiritual state of his Penitent, whether he be due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly qualified, or not, to receive Absolution.—<hi>Vid.</hi> Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick, <hi>ut supra.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:42008:2"/>V. The Minister Absolving is to rest Satisfied with an Account of the general Repentance of the Person to be Absolved, who is not obliged to make a particular and special Confession of his Sins to the Absolver, unless he feel his Conscience troubled with any weighty matter; as appears by the Rubrick, <hi>ut supra.</hi> To affirm the contrary, is to plead for Auricular Confession, as 'tis taught and practised in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">VI. If the Person to be Absolved makes a special volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Confession of his Sins, the Absolver is bound by the Canon to conceal it, and keep it a Secret from all the World. <hi>Vid.</hi> 113. <hi>Can.</hi> If it be Objected that in case of a Treasonable Conspiracy which the Penitent confesses, the Absolver is not bound to conceal it, it may be answer'd, that in the Case of Sir <hi>I. F.</hi> and Sir <hi>W. P.</hi> there was no treasonable Conspiracy so pretended or laid to their charge, but what was discovered and made publick, and which they were Convicted of.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. Suppose, that after the Death of the Absolved Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, who dies in his Bed by the Visitation of God, a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per should be published under his own Hand (which the Absolver knew nothing of) whereby it appears that he was Guilty of <hi>Heresy</hi> in the Church, and Treason in the State, and that he justified both the one and the other: Shall this affect the Absolver, and make him a Criminal in giving Absolvtion? If not, then, with Submission, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could the Paper left by Sir <hi>I. F.</hi> and Sir <hi>W. P.</hi> with the Sheriff, and afterwards published, which the Absolvers were altogether Strangers to, any ways affect the said Absolvers, or render them Criminals in giving them Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution.</p>
            <p n="8">
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:42008:3"/>VIII. Suppose that Sir <hi>I. F.</hi> and Sir <hi>W. P.</hi> had left no Paper with the Sheriff, and none had been published after their Death; 'tis presum'd then that the Absolvers would not have been Questioned, or Censur'd for giving them Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. Nay farther, suppose that Sir <hi>I. F.</hi> and Sir <hi>W. P.</hi> had left a Paper with the Sheriff, which he had after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards publish'd, acknowledging their Guilt, and signify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Repentance as to that particular Crime which they were Convicted of; then 'tis presum'd that the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution would have been so far from being Censur'd for giving them Absolution, that it would have been generally agreed to be a Charitable, regular and lawful Act. And if it was in it self a lawful Act at the time of the Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of it, no subsequent Act or Circumstance whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, which the Absolvers were Strangers to, would make it unlawful. Nothing could make it unlawful <hi>à parte post,</hi> which was a lawful Act <hi>à parte ante.</hi> But if it was in it self an unlawfull Act at the time of the performance of it, no subsequent Act or Circumstance whatsoever; how grateful soever to the Government, as in the before mention'd instance, could make it lawful.</p>
