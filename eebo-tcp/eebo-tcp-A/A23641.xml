            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was the profeſsion of the Lord Jeſus before <hi>Pilate,</hi> when he queſtioned with him about his Kingdome, <hi>John 18.37.</hi> That for this cauſe he was born and came into the world, to beare witneſſe of the truth. Many truths about the ſpirituall Kingdom of Chriſt hath he imparted to us, if therfore we be born into the world, or ſent into this Wilderneſſe to beare witneſſe to his truth, it is unto us reward ſufficient, that we ſhould be witneſſes thereunto, even to the utmoſt parts of the Earth. Wee confeſſe wee have been too ſlow in this ſervice of Chriſt, not having to this day ſet forth an unanimous Confeſsion of that Form of wholſome words which is Preached, received, and profeſſed in theſe Churches of the Lord Jeſus; and which we are not unmind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of, though our diſtances, and other difficulties may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay the opportunity. But this in the meane time we profeſſe in generall, That (ſo farre as wee know) there is the ſame bleſſed Spirit of Truth breathing in the Miniſtery of the Country; the ſame Faith embraced and profeſſed in the Churches, which is generally received as the Orthodox Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Goſpel, in the beſt reformed Churches, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly by our godly learned Brethren of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> And though errours have ſprung up among us, and ſome are gone out from us, that we feare were not of us, yet
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60763:3"/>
wee have borne witneſſe againſt them, and by the bleſsing of God, by the breath of Chriſt in the mouths of his ſervants they have been blaſted. Neither doe we underſtand that theſe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are accuſed of any errours about the ſaving truths of the Goſpel, and therefore we thought our ſelves not ſo much called of God to ſuch a Confeſsion at preſent, as to cleare up to the world thoſe Truths we profeſſe about the kingdome and government of Chriſt in his Churches, which is the great worke of this age, and of this nick of time. And yet here alſo we feare that we have been too ſlack; for though it bee ſaid, <hi>VVee are the Volunteers, ſuch as cry up this way, &amp;c.</hi> and ſo it ſeemes wee are apprehended to bee one cauſe of theſe preſent differences: yet if things be well weighed, we may ſeem rather to bee farre behinde in the duty that lyes upon us. Indeed ſome briefe Anſwers ſent over to ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſons, to ſatisfie Brethren what our practiſe is, (with ſome briefe touch of our reaſons) rather then to diſc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ſſe thoſe points, have been printed by ſome without our knowledge, or aſſent, upon what grounds they beſt know. And ſome ſhort Treatiſes by ſome reverend Brethren have been publiſhed to declare their affectionate deſires of the unanimous endevours of all our deare Brethren, for a generall and holy Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: But what hath been ſaid or done that either may juſtly offend the minds of the godly, provoke their ſpirits, diſunite their affections, or hinder a godly Reformation? Yea, wee have been too ſlow to cleare our Doctrine and practiſe from the many objections, harſh interpretations, and manifold cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations caſt upon the ſame, wherein wee feare our lothneſſe to intermeddle in theſe Controverſies for feare of making the breach wider amongſt Brethren; and our deſire rather to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend what light we might receive from others in theſe points wherein wee profeſſe our ſelves ſeekers after the truth, have made us guilty of neglect in this our duty. But now we ſee our ſelves preſſed hereto, by a neceſsity of juſtifying our wayes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb facs="tcp:60763:3"/>
the many aſperſions caſt upon them, as well as againſt the Reaſons uſed againſt them, for wee perceive by the firſt Letter of our Brethren, how the with-drawing of Chriſtians from the Liturgy was imputed to us, and by this Reply both in the Epiſtle and divers paſſages, wee cannot but ſee what ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions are raiſed of us; yea, many are apt to think, that if we had ſaid nothing, yet our very act in forſaking the Churches of God in our deare native Country, and the Cauſe of Chriſt there, together with the practiſe of theſe Churches thought to bee ſo different from the reformed Churches, have been, not onely a great weakening to the hands of the Godly, (that have ſtood by the Cauſe of Chriſt) but alſo have cauſed great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance to the Reformation in hand: To which much might be ſaid, but that wee ſhould exceed the bounds of an Epiſtle. Yet let us intreat all the Godly wiſe, to conſider and look back upon the-ſeaſon of this great enterpriſe, undertaken by us, and the manner of our proceedings in it, with the admirable wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings of Gods Providence firſt and laſt about it; and we think (though we were ſilent) they may eaſily ſatisfie themſelves, whether this was of God or men, a ſinfull neglect of the Cauſe of Chriſt, or a manifeſt attestation to the truth, by open profeſsion againſt Corruptions of Worſhip in uſe, and for the neceſsity of reformation of the Church; and that confirmed by no ſmall degree of ſufferings for the ſame. For was it not a time when humane Worſhip and inventions were growne to ſuch an intolerable height, that the conſciences of Gods ſaints and ſervants inlightened in the truth) could no longer bear them? was not the power of the tyrannicall Prelates ſo great, that like a ſtrong Current carryed all down ſtreame before it, what ever was from the law, or otherwiſe ſet in their way? Did not the hearts of men generally faile them? Where was the people to bee found that would cleave to their godly Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters in their ſufferings, but rather thought it their diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to provide for their owne quiet and ſafety? Yea, when
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60763:4"/>
ſome freely in zeale of the Truth preached or profeſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the corruptions of the times, did not ſome take offence at it, judge it raſhneſſe, and to bee againſt all rules of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, who ſince are ready to cenſure us for deſerting the Cauſe? Many then thought, it is an evill time, the prudent ſhall hold their peace, and might wee not ſay, this is not our reſting place? And what would men have us doe in ſuch a caſe? Muſt wee ſtudy ſome diſtinctions to ſalve our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences in complying with ſo manifold corruptions in Gods Worſhip? or ſhould wee live without Gods ordinances, becauſe wee could not partake in the corrupt adminiſtration thereof? or content our ſelves to live without thoſe ordinances of Gods Worſhip and Communion of Saints which hee called us unto, and our ſoules breathed after? or ſhould wee forſake the publique Aſſemblies, and joyne together in private ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated Churches? how unſufferable it would then have been, the great offence that now is taken at it, is a full evidence. And if in Cities, or ſome ſuch great Townes that might have been done, yet how was it poſsible for ſo many ſcattered Chriſtians all over the Countrey? It is true, we might have ſuffered, if wee had ſought it, wee might eaſily have found the way to have filled the Priſons, and ſome had their ſhare therein. But whether wee were called thereunto, when a wide doore was ſet open of liberty otherwiſe; and our witneſſe to the truth, (through the malignant policy of thoſe times) could not bee open before the world, but rather ſmothered up in cloſe priſons or ſome ſuch wayes, together with our ſelves, wee leave to bee conſidered. Wee cannot ſee but the rule of Chriſt to his Apoſtles and Saints, and the practiſe of Gods Saints in all ages, may allow us this liberty as well as others, to fly into the Wilderneſſe from the face of the Dragon. But if it had been ſo, that the Godly Miniſters and Chriſtians that fled to <hi>New-England,</hi> were the moſt timorous and faint hearted of all their Brethren, that ſtayed behinde, and that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60763:4"/>
thoſe ſufferings were nothing in compariſon of their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threns (for why ſhould any boaſt of ſufferings?) yet who doth not know that the Spirit who gives various gifts, and all to profit withall, in ſuch times doth ſingle out every one to ſuch worke, as hee in wiſdome intends to call them unto? And whom the Lord will honour by ſuffering for his Cauſe, by impriſonment, &amp;c. hee gives them ſpirits ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thereto: whom the Lord will reſerve for other ſervice, or imploy in other places, hee inclines their hearts rather to fly, giving them an heart ſuitable to ſuch a condition. It is a caſe of Conſcience frequently put, and oft reſolved by holy <hi>Bradford, Peter Martyr, Philpot,</hi> and others, in Queene <hi>Maries</hi> bloody dayes, viz. Whether it was lawfull to flee out of the Land: To which their anſwer was, that if God gave a ſpirit of courage and willingneſſe to glorifie him by ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, they ſhould ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ay; but if they found not ſuch a ſpirit they might lawfully fly, yea, they adviſed them thereunto. Thoſe Servants of Chriſt, though full of the ſpirit of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and of Chriſt to outface the greateſt perſecuters in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion of the Truth, unto the death, yet did not complaine of the cowardize of ſuch as fled, becauſe they deſerted them and the Cauſe, but rather adviſed divers ſo to doe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced when God gave liberty to their brethren to eſcape with their lives to the places of liberty, to ſerve the Lord accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his Word. Neither were thoſe faithfull Saints and ſervants of God uſeleſſe and unprofitable in the Church of God that fled from the bloody Prelates. The infinite and onely wiſe God hath many workes to doe in the World, and hee doth by his ſingular Providence give gifts to his Servants, and diſpoſeth them to his Worke as ſeemeth beſt to himſelfe. If the Lord will have ſome to beare witneſſe by impriſonments, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring, &amp;c. wee honour them therein; if hee will have others inſtrumentall to promote reformation in <hi>England,</hi> wee honor them, and rejoyce in their holy endeavours, praying for a

bleſsing upon themſelves and labours. And what if God will have his Church and the Kingdome of Chriſt goe up alſo in theſe remote parts of the world, that his Name may bee known to the Heathen, or whatſoever other end hee hath, and to this end will ſend forth a company of weake-hearted Chriſtians, which dare not ſtay at home to ſuffer, why ſhould wee not let the Lord alone, and rejoyce that Chriſt is preached how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, and whereſoever? And who can ſay that this work was not undertaken and carryed on with ſincere and right ends, and in an holy ſerious manner, by the chiefe and the body of ſuch as undertooke the ſame? The Lord knows whether the ſincere deſires of worſhipping himſelfe according to his will, of promoting and propagating the Goſpel, was not in the hearts of very many in this enterpriſe; and hee that ſeeth in ſecret, and rewardeth openly, knows what prayers and teares have been poured out to God by many alone, and in dayes of f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

Wee will here ſay nothing of the perſons whoſe hearts the Lord ſtirred up in this buſineſſe; ſurely all were not raſh, weake-ſpirited, inconſiderate of what they left behinde, or of what it was to goe into a Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. But if it were well knowne and conſidered, or if wee were able to expreſſe and recount the ſingular workings of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60763:5"/>
divine Providence, for the bringing on of this Worke, to what it is come unto, it would ſtop the mouths of all that have not an heart to accuſe and blaſpheme the goodneſſe of God in his glorious workes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whatever many may ſay or think, wee beleeve after-times will admire and adore the Lord herein, when all his holy ends, and the wayes he hath uſed to bring them about ſhall appeare. Look from one end of the heaven to another, whether the Lord hath aſſayed to do ſuch a Worke as this in any Nation, ſo to carry out a people of his owne from ſo flouriſhing a State, to a wilderneſſe ſo far diſtant, for ſuch ends, and for ſuch a worke: Yea, and in few yeares hath done for them, as hee hath here done for his poore deſpiſed people. When wee looke back and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what a ſtrange poiſe of ſpirit the Lord hath laid upon many of our hearts, wee cannot but wonder at our ſelves, that ſo many, and ſome ſo weak and tender, with ſuch cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe and conſtant reſolutions againſt ſo many perſwaſions of friends, diſcouragements from the ill report of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, the ſtraits, wants, and tryalls of Gods people in it, &amp;c. yet ſhould leave our accommodations and comforts, ſhould forſake our deareſt relations, Parents, brethren, Siſters, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian friends, and acquaintances, over looke all the dangers and difficulties of the vaſt Seas, the thought whereof was a terrour to many, and all this to go to a Wilderneſse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where wee could forecaſt nothing but care and temptations, onely in hopes of enjoying Christ in his Ordinances, in the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip of his people; was this from a ſtupid ſenſleſneſſe or deſperate careleſneſſe what became of us or ours? or want of naturall affections to our deare Countrey, or neareſt relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? No ſurely, with what bowells of compaſsion to our deare Countrey; with what heart-breaking affections, to our deare relations, and Chriſtian friends many of us at leaſt came away, the Lord is witneſſe. What ſhall we ſay of the ſingular Providence of God bringing ſo many Ship-loads of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60763:6"/>
his people, through ſo many dangers, as upon Eagles wings, with ſo much ſafety from yeare to yeare? The fatherly care of our God in feeding and cloathing ſo many in a Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, giving ſuch healthfulneſſe and great increaſe of poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity? what ſhall wee ſay of the Worke it ſelfe of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Chriſt? and the form of a Common-wealth erected in a Wilderneſſe, and in ſo few yeares brought to that ſtate, that ſcarce the like can bee ſeen in any of our Engliſh Colonies in the richeſt places of this <hi>America,</hi> after many more years ſtanding? That the Lord hath carryed the ſpirits of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his people through all their toylſome labour, wants, diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, loſſes, &amp;c. with ſuch a meaſure of chearfulneſſe and contentation? But above all wee muſt acknowledge the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular pity and mercies of our God, that hath done all this and much more for a people ſo unworthy, ſo ſinfull, that by murmurings of many, unfaithfulneſſe in promiſes, oppreſsions, and other evils which are found among us, have ſo diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured his Majeſty, expoſed his worke here to much ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall and obloquie, for which wee have cauſe for ever to bee aſhamed, that the Lord ſhould yet owne us, and rather cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect us in mercy, then caſt us off in diſpleaſure, and ſcatter us in this Wilderneſſe, which gives us cauſe with <hi>Mich. 7.</hi> to ſay, <hi>Who is a God like our God, that pardoneth ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, and paſſeth by the tranſgreſſions of the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of his heritage; even becauſe he delighteth in mercy</hi>? Though we be a people of many weakneſſes and wants, yet wee acknowledge our God to have been to us a God of many mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, in reſpect of that ſweet peace which he hath taken away from ſo many Nations, yet continuing the ſame to us; in reſpect alſo of that liberty wee have in Gods houſe, the bleſſed Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of the Word, the ſweet unity and communion of Gods Churches and Miniſters, increaſe and multiplication of Churches, Chriſtian government in the Common-wealth, and many other mercies wee enjoy, but eſpecially the gracious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60763:6"/>
of Chriſt to many of our ſoules in all theſe. But wee will not inſiſt much upon this ſubject, being perſwaded it is in the conſciences and hearts of many of our dear Countrey-men to thinke that we ſhould be an object of love and tenderneſſe to that State and people, by whoſe Laws and unkind uſages we were driven out into a wilderneſſe, rather then to bee judged as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertors of our Brethren, and the Cauſe of Chriſt in hand: with whom (excuſe us if we now ſpeak plainly) it had been far more eaſie unto many of us to have ſuffered, then to have adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red hither upon the wilderneſſe ſorrows wee expected to have met withall; though we muſt confeſſe the Lord hath ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it beyond our thoughts, and utmoſt expectations of prudent men.</p>
            <p>But paſsing by this wee muſt deſire the Reader to beare with us a little in removing that apprehenſion that wee are the great stumbling block in the way of Reformation, which (if it were true) it had been better we had been driven ſo farre into this wilderneſſe, as never to have been heard of more.</p>
            <p>Concerning our affection to this bleſſed worke of a publique Reformation, of the Nation in generall, and the particular Churches or Congregations of the Land in particular, (as it is beſt knowne to God) ſo wee thinke it is not unknowne to men, not onely here by our daily prayers for it, and ſometime ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne ſeekings of God about it; but alſo we have given ſome teſtimonies thereof both by private Letters, and the publique motions of ſome of Gods eminent ſervants among us tending that way.</p>
            <p>We conceive two things ſpecially in our Doctrine and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, that may ſeem to bee ſtumbling blocks in the way of this publique Reformation, which we ſhall here remove.</p>
            <p>The firſt is our practiſe wherein wee ſeem ſo much to differ from the reformed Churches, in receiving to our Churches onely viſible Saints and beleevers.</p>
            <p>This we doe freely confeſſe that our practiſe and judgement
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60763:7"/>
doe evidence this to all, that we thinke reformation of the Church doth not onely conſiſt in purging out corrupt Worſhip, and ſetting up the true; but alſo in purging the Churches from ſuch profaneneſſe and ſinfulneſſe as is ſcandalous to the Goſpel, and makes the Lord weary of his owne Ordinances, <hi>Eſay 1.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And wee doubt not but this was in the hearts of many, (if not moſt) of Gods ſervants, to deſire a ſeparation of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious from the vile, in the diſpenſing of Gods ordinances; and if the charity of ſome be of larger extent herein then others, this hinders not agreement in the maine.</p>
            <p>This day hath diſcovered what kinde of people are to bee found every where in the Pariſhes of <hi>England:</hi> Can light and darkneſſe, Chriſt and Belial agree together? Popiſh epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall enemies and haters of all godlineſſe and reformation, cleave together in one Church of Chriſt, with the Saints of God?</p>
            <p>Yet neither our Doctrine nor practiſe do preſcribe and limit the way of attaining this reformation, whereby any ſhould juſtly from our example ſtand off from concurring in ſuch a publique worke.</p>
            <p>It is true, where there is no Church relation, but a people are to begin a new conſtituting of Churches, reformation is to be ſought in the firſt Conſtitution. This is our caſe. But where corrupted Churches, (ſuch as we conceive the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations of <hi>England</hi> generally to be) are to be reformed, there we conceive that ſuch Congregations ſhould bee called by able Miniſters unto repentance for former evills, and confeſsing and bewayling their ſins, renew a ſolemn Covenant with God to reform themſelves, and to ſubmit unto the diſcipline of Chriſt. By which meanes ſuch as refuſe ſo to doe, exclude themſelves, and others by the ſeverity of Diſcipline ſhould bee pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged out, if falling into ſinne they remaine impenitent in the ſame.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:60763:7"/>What ſome particular perſons may have ſaid or done con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to this our profeſsion, wee cannot ſay, nor doe we juſtifie, but wee know nothing that hath come from us to the contrary, to weaken the hands of godly reformers, or to perſwade the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to ſeparate from the Congregations, if by any meanes they might attaine (with toleration of what can be) the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof, with the liberty of Gods true worſhip therein. If indeed that cannot bee obtained, but men contradict and blaſpheme them, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſeparated the Diſciples, ſo wee ſee no other remedy the faithfull have in ſuch a caſe.</p>
            <p>The ſecond ſtumbling block may be our Doctrine and practiſe about Church-Government, when wee give Diſcipline as well as other Ordinances to particular Churches, not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting them to any Government out of themſelves; but onely to take the brotherly counſell and helpe one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>But how this ſhould hinder a generall Reformation we ſee not, for if every Church ſo reforme themſelves (as is afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid) and have ſuch Officers over them as the rule of the New Teſtament requires, <hi>1 Tim. 3. Tit. 2.</hi> wee need not feare to betruſt the Church (having ſuch Officers) with that power which we conceive Chriſt hath given to the ſame, other Churches watching over them, counſelling and admoniſhing them in the Lord.</p>
            <p>But if there be not ſuch a reformation of the Churches, nor ſuch guides ſet over them, the power of the keyes in a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery of ſuch Pastors as may not be according to the rule, may as much abuſe them as a particular Church may doe, and it may be to the hurt of many who would uſe them better, in their own Congregations, then they can in a Claſsis, being over-voted there.</p>
            <p>And we cannot conceive but both the care of reforming the matter of a Church, and the recalling of the power of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to the Church, tends much to further this worke
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60763:8"/>
of reformation, no way to hinder the ſame.</p>
            <p>And if wee might obtaine that of our deare Brethren, which wee humbly crave, <hi>viz.</hi> That our Doctrine and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe might be taken candidly according to our plaine meaning, and declarations, and not repreſented unto the World under ſuch ſhapes and formes as make it ſeeme rigid (all one with the moſt rigid Separatiſts, Donatiſts, Arminians, Socinians, &amp;c.) we ſhould hope that we ſhall goe for lovers and friends to a godly and generall Reformation, not for diſturbers of the ſame; but the contrary dealing we meet with too too oft through the miſtakes of Brethren; This learned Author Mr. <hi>Ball,</hi> though in the Epiſtle he deſired us to reſt aſſured, that although he had conceived ſuch thoughts of us as leaning to ſeparation, yet he would gladly receive every ſyllable from us that ſhould diſlodge ſuch thoughts, yet againſt our plaine profeſsion ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time he will needs faſten the opinion of ſeparation upon us, and very frequently ſets Mr. <hi>Robinſon</hi> in a parallel with our opinions, (as if we generally went that way in thoſe things) which are well known to be the Doctrine of many of our godly and beſt reformers.</p>
            <p>The Learned may plainly ſee, how eaſie it had been for us and upon better grounds to have filled our margents with quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations out of Papiſts and Prelates as parallel with many paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of this Reply, but we have purpoſely abſtained from ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that we might not caſt any blur or provoke the ſpirits of brethren.</p>
            <p>And ſeeing we are inforced to wipe off ſuch aſperſions, we humbly deſire our beloved Brethren (whoſe learned labours wee honour) to beare with us if we lightly touch this ſore, for wee confeſſe it brings bluſhing into our faces, and ſadneſſe to our hearts, to read ſo often ſuch harſh imputations caſt upon us, which we cannot conceive but (falling from ſuch pens) they breed a ſtrange loathing of us in the ſtomachs of many that read bookes without ſerious examinations thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:60763:8"/>Firſt, how oft doe wee meet with that imputation, that wee make none members of a viſible Church but ſuch as are really ſaints and beleevers, contrary to our frequent profeſsion, That viſible ſaints that are ſuch in judgement of charity are fit mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Church?</p>
            <p>Secondly, that we make a vocall Church Oath or Covenant, the eſſentiall forme of a Church, when as wee frequently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that this Covenant which conſtituteth a Church, is either implicite or explicite, and that Congregations in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> are truly Churches having an implicite covenant: and it is far from our practiſe to uſe any Oath in our Covenant, and ſtrange to us to read ſo many Pages againſt our Church Oath, and ſwearing to a Covenant, to make our courſes horrid and too too rigorous.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that we ſet up a popular government, making the Elders of the Church no more but moderators, &amp;c. and that Miniſters rec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ive their power from the people, are their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and adminiſter in their name, (as Mr. <hi>Ball</hi> and others object) when we oft profeſſe the contrary, that all autho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ity (properly ſo called) is in the hands of the Elders, and the liberty of the people is to bee carryed in a way of ſubjection, and obedience to them in the Lord: neither doth it follow from any Doctrine of ours, no more then from the ordination of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors by the Presbytery, that they are their ſervants, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, that if a Congregation reject a Paſtor <hi>for no fault,</hi> they take both <hi>nomen &amp; eſſe,</hi> the name and nature of a Paſtor from him. For this the Reader is referred to our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of the twenty fift Queſtion of the thirty two queſtions ſent unto us, where nothing at all is ſaid, but reference is made to our anſwer to the nine queſtions, amongſt which the ſeventh being of this very point, our anſwer is quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what is imputed to us. Our words are theſe, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Miniſter himſelfe thus depoſed, &amp;c. we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive though hee bee by them deprived of the execution
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60763:9"/>
of his Miniſtery amongſt them, yet untill hee accept of a call to another people, hee ſtill remaine a Miniſter of Chriſt; in whoſe account hee hath true right of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration among the people.</hi> Now if hee remaine a Miniſter of Chriſt, and have true right to adminiſter, let any judge whether wee take away <hi>nomen</hi> or <hi>eſſe;</hi> or that wee make Church cenſures worke <hi>ex opere operato, clave errante,</hi> as is alſo imputed to us. Many ſuch miſtakes we finde, but let theſe ſuffice to informe the Reader how wary hee had need bee in receiving ſuch reports againſt brethren: and this charity wee have cauſe the more earneſtly to crave of all, that they would reſerve one eare to heare what their poore out-caſt brethren can ſay for themſelves, becauſe wee are placed at ſuch a diſtance and diſadvantage, that oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it is not poſsible for us to take notice of ſuch objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and return an anſwer under a yeare or almoſt two years, whereby Satan hath a marvailous advantage to work ſtrange thoughts and diſtaſtefull affections towards us, and faſten them ſo deeply that hardly they will bee taken off again. But thus it falleth out too too frequently, that when Brethren, otherwiſe deare to each other, differ, in their judgements, and breake out to open contention about the ſame, they are very apt to make the opinions of the contrary party as unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and abſurd to the judgement of others, as may bee, whence griefe, offence, and alienations of affections (through the ſubtilty of Satan, and the corruption of our hearts) are ready to follow. And this makes us both fearfull of our ſelves, leſt wee ſhould give way to any unloving thoughts towards the deare ſervants of Chriſt, or returne any offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive language unto them; yea, this cauſeth us oft to bewaile that, which can never bee enough lamented, the ſad diſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and ſharpe contentions between ſuch neare brethren, whom the Lord hath ſo conjoyned in the ſame Cauſe of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And oh that our deare brethren would beare with us
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60763:9"/>
a little here, and give us leave to poure out our humble and affectionate requeſts and expoſtulations into their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomes! Wee would bee very loath to impute any thing to our deare Country and beloved brethren that is not evident, or to rip up private failings, and make them publique: but when Pulpits and Preſſes proclaime to the world not onely the diſtances in judgement, but alſo alienation of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; when there is ſuch ſtraining to make the contrary te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents as odious to the world as may bee, ſuch inlarging of differences, as if the wounds could never bee healed; ſuch gall and vineger poured on, in ſtead of the ſalt of ſavoury ſpeeches, and the oyle of ſmooth and ſoft words to calm and pacifie ſpirits already provoked; yea, when there want not ſome that ſeeke all private Letters they can gather up, and ſearch every corner to diſcover and publiſh to the world the ſeeming failings of brethren; when contentions are grown to that paſſe, that ſuch orthodox, learned, and godly brethren whoſe faithfull labours in the Lords worke, and great ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and uſe they may be of in time to come, might worthily plead for a roome in the boſomes and inmoſt affections of their brethren, are cryed out againſt as not to bee indured in the Countrey, becauſe of ſome difference in ſome points of diſcipline: when theſe things are ſo, who that have any ſenſe of Gods diſhonour, or true love to his Countreys good, can forbeare from teares, or hold his peace, that have any opportunity to utter his griefe? Wee will not take upon us to ſay who began this fray, or who have moſt tranſgreſſed the rules of charity and to ſedome. The Lord give every man an heart that hath failed to bee affected with their owne, and ready to pity and pardon one anothers weakneſſes: neither doe wee hereby blame loving and candid debating of differences to finde out the truth; but give us leave to ſay thus much to all, (for our hearts and ſoules are with all the faithfull ſervants of Chriſt, that deſire according to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60763:10"/>
their light to promote the kingdome of Chriſt Jeſus, what ever their diſtance of judgement from us may be) What, deare brethren, is there no balme in <hi>Gilead,</hi> no Phyſitian to heale this wound? alaſſe, how is it now ſo wide and deep, that at the firſt was preſented to the world ſo ſmall, or ſcarce any at all? When the Prelates petitioned for their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, becauſe the Reformers were not, nor could ever agree upon one Forme: it was profeſſed that in ſix Points (whereof ſome are now the greateſt bones of contention) all did agree; and doubted not but if the Prelates were downe, all would agree in one. And was this bare words to put off the Prelaticall petition? or did the Author ſpeake without ground at adventures? God forbid wee ſhould thinke ſo; but what the common adverſary will think and ſpeak, it would grieve a godly heart to conſider. How comes it then to paſſe the breach is growne ſo great? It rejoyced our hearts to ſee that ingenuous, Chriſtian and peaceable diſpoſition in that ever honoured brother <hi>Mr. Herle,</hi> who brought the diſtance in his Preface to ſuch a narrow, as if one plaſter more might ſeeme to have healed it; oh that there had been many more of that peace<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>making ſpirit! what heart-burnings and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions had been prevented. Wee thought alſo that meeke Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logetick Narration gave a faire opportunity of cloſing with brethren in ſuch things as they profeſſed to concur in, but what contrary entertainment it found, wee lament to conſider. And is it now come to this paſſe, that theſe who were in a manner one cannot live together in the ſame kingdome? Oh the depth of the malice and ſubtilty of that old Serpent! Oh the policy and undermining faculty of the Jeſuiticall generation, (who no doubt have a great influence in this divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion!) Oh the frailties of fleſh and blood in Gods deareſt Saints! Oh the unſearchable depths of the Lords eternall counſels, that for holy ends leaves his owne to ſuch tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and yet knows how, and will aſſuredly improve all
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60763:10"/>
this to his owne glory, and the lifting up of the name and kingdome of Chriſt in deſpite of all the gates of hell; and give his ſervants once a ſeaſon to ſing together this ſong of <hi>Moſes</hi> and of the Lambe in triumph over all their enemies. But what? is the cauſe paſt helpe and remedy? ſhall we think, alaſſe, there is no hope, they will not leave untill they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured each other, better for us to ſay nothing, wee ſhall bee but cenſured and ſlighted of all? God forbid, have wee ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured thus farre, and ſhall wee not preſume a little further? Oh that we were worthy and fit to propound any thing that might tend to mollifie this ſore: Or that the Lord himſelfe would ſpeake by ſuch poore creatures any word in ſeaſon to helpe (at leaſt a little) in this ſad caſe! We will not, deare Brethren, make this long Epiſtle more tedious by preſenting unto you all that might be ſaid to move and perſwade your hearts to ſtudy peace and unity, and with one ſhoulder to ſet your ſelves to further this bleſſed worke of publique Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for which the Lord hath put ſuch an opportunity into your hands, as never was the like, and God knows, whether ever it will bee, if this bee ſlipped. Wee are perſwaded, when the heate of contention is laid aſide, the bleſſed Spirit of Chriſt in you doth ſecretly ſuggeſt arguments enough unto your hearts. Doe you not oft heare ſuch whiſperings as theſe. Are they not Brethren who differ from us? hath not the Lord received them? doe they not ſtand or fall to their own Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and how ſhall wee reject or judge them? have we not our ignorances and frailties? what, is there no conſolation in Chriſt, no comfort of love, no fellowſhip of the ſpirit? or if ſo, ſhould not this perſwade us to bee of one minde in the Lord? doe wee not hope to live in heaven together, and ſhall wee ſtand at ſuch diſtances here? ſhall wee thus ſuffer peace to goe from us, and not follow and purſue it? ſhall we loſe the bleſsing of peace-makers? ſhall wee by ſuch differences, thus gratifie Satan, Jeſuites, Prelates, &amp;c. and ſtrengthen
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60763:11"/>
their hands by weakening our owne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are we not in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to devoure each other, and expoſe all to ruine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is it not high time for us that are one in the Orthodox truth, to joyne heart and hand to pray, and preach, and write as one, to ſtop the floud-gate of errours and abominations that Satan hath ſet open to the drowning of many ſoules<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the hazzard of many of the ſheep of Chriſt, whiles wee are contending about ſome matters of order which though they bee of moment, yet muſt give way unto more fundamentall truths; and oh that this miſchief were ſufficiently laid to heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſpreadings of ſuch gangrenes looked to in ſeaſon! What will not all our vowes, covenants and ſolemne Oaths binde us together? Theſe and many ſuch heart-breaking conſiderations wee doubt not are before your eyes daily, which therefore wee will not inlarge. Onely give us leave to propound what we conceive in our weake judgement might ſomewhat tend to heale this distance. Wee confeſſe wee ſtand farre from the marke, and may miſſe the matter, but if we doe, let our well-meaning bee accepted, and our weakneſſe pardoned.</p>
            <p>Two things, as we touched before, we conceive keep our deare brethren from cloſing together in one to promote the publique and generall Reformation.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that point of Reformation which concernes the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Churches, and here wee feare the diſtance at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent is great. For when it's thought, on the one hand, that there is no need of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ending godly Preachers to the ignorant and prophane Pariſhes to inſtruct them; humble them, and prepare them for a gracious Reformation, but that Paſtors (if they could bee found, ſhould bee ſent to them, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter to them as they are, if they will but joyne in the natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Covenant, as moſt have done, (for we ſee no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired) and when godly Paſtors may not have power to try their people whether they can examine themſelves, diſcerne the Lords body, and walke according to Chriſt, before they

ſuch an unkind anſwer, We will not have this man reigne over us? haſt thou not yet learned ſo much wiſdom, as to kiſſe the ſon, no not now when he is angry and the ſword in his hand?

            <p>But what doe we thus to take upon us, and let looſe our Pen ſo far? pardon, we beſeech you, Chriſtian Reader, this ſeeming boldneſſe, it is our hearty affection to the peace and proſperity of our deare Countrey, and the Saints of God in it, that have drawn theſe things from us. Say not, what calling have theſe thus to admoniſh and cenſure us? Cenſure we doe not, (that we would doe onely to our ſelves) but faithfully to admoniſh and exhort in the Lord, we hope we may preſume. Neither have we taken upon us this whole weighty worke, of our owne minds, but at the requeſt and call of divers our reverend Brethren, whoſe voice herein we looked upon as the voice of God; nor have wee accepted that call, out of any iuſt we have to contend, or enter the liſts of diſputation with any. Wee love the peace of the Churches, and unity and concord with all our deare and godly Brethren too well, to have any ſuch ends. And though wee are not unwilling to receive and conſider any returne that may bee made, and we hope with a mind to ſubmit to the truth; yet wee muſt profeſſe Two things chiefly inclined us to undertake this worke. Firſt, to cleare up ſuch truths as we conceive to bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the minde of Chriſt, which were obſcured by this Reply. Secondly, (and that eſpecially) hoping that what wee ſhould write, would tend rather to a peaceable healing of offences and differences, then otherwiſe; and therefore have preſumed
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60763:14"/>
to Preface thus farre, and ſo to preſent theſe our affectionate requeſts to our deare Brethren, and Country-men, which wee heartily recommend to their ſerious conſideration, and to the bleſsing of God, who onely can incline the hearts of men, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to any thing of God ſet before them; though wee bee the meanest and weakeſt of many, to take upon us, thus to ſpeake to our deare Country-men, yet through the grace of Chriſt who put us into the Miniſtery, we have beſtowed a great part of our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in theſe parts, neither (we hope) altogether in vaine; which makes us ſomewhat the more engaged and encouraged to write as we doe. And now having thus farre in this Epiſtle, and in the Booke following, teſtified our love to the truth, and deſires of the peace, unity, reformation, and proſperity of our beloved <hi>England,</hi> and the Churches of God therein, wee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend both to the conſideration of the Reader, and all to the grace and bleſsing of Chriſt Jeſus, and rest.</p>

            <p>To which wee anſwer, that as the Church fell by degrees into univerſall pollution, by the Apoſtacy fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told to bee under the Man of Sin; ſo by degrees it recovers it out of it againe: If therefore ſeparation reach no farther then ſeparation from ſinnes, and ſuch ſinnes of Churches wherein our ſelves in joyning with them muſt bee involved, wee ſuppoſe ſuch ſeparation
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:60763:15"/>
(all due reſpect and love reſerved and profeſſed to the Churches themſelves) cannot juſtly bee accounted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable; and 'tis the profeſſion of the Author in his Epiſtle, to plead for communion with the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Chriſt, no farther then they hold communion with Chriſt: If any tranſgreſſe theſe bounds, either in reſpect of private or publique communion in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> wee muſt profeſſe openly, that if any mourn for it, wee are (or would bee) companions with them in that griefe. Whoſe heart bleeds not to ſee Gods flock ſcattered, and needleſſe rents made? that ſcarce Truth or errour can now adayes bee received, but it is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in a way of Schiſme; directly contrary to the gathering and uniting Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt: A wide Conſcience calls evill, good, and therefore can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with any evill; a ſtrait Conſcience cals good, evill, (as <hi>Gerſon</hi> obſerves) and therefore can readily ſeparate even from that which is good. When raſh and ſudden men are grown maſters of their Conſciences, it troubles not them from whom they divide, nor whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they run in ſeparate wayes; when weak (yet god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men) are under the tenderneſſe, (yet much darkneſſe) of Conſcience, being very timorous of wayes that are evill, grow many times ſhy (at leaſt in ſimplicity are led) from wayes that afterward are found to be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and good. 'Tis the uſuall miſery of <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, either to ſpin the Spiders web, and ſwallow down all corruptions in Churches; or ſo to breake downe the gap in forſaking corruptions utterly to abandon the Churches themſelves: The wine of cauſeleſſe ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath a ſpirit in it, (if God graciouſly prevent not) that hurries men headlong to ſtrange diſtances, that in ſeparating from publique, they ſeparate from private; in ſeparating from corrupt Churches (as no Churches)
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60763:16"/>
they ſeparate from the pureſt, even thoſe of their own; in ſeparating from pollutions of Gods ordinances, at laſt they fall to the ſtorming of ſome, if not to the utter renouncing of all the Ordinances themſelves: we mourne (wee ſay) for ſuch evills, and could with ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded knees deſire our deare Countrey-men to conſider, whether this bee the Spirit of Chriſt Jeſus that ſo car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries them; to reject them whom the Lord Jeſus hath not yet wholly forſaken; and not rather with one heart, and with bowells of compaſſion (if any liberty can bee procured) to ſtudy how to heale the bleeding breaches, and manifold evills of ſick and ſinfull <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> that in their owne recovery from pollutions, the whole may ariſe and ſhare alike with them therein; tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating with all long-ſuffering many things amiſſe, &amp; mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning daily after the Lord, till ſuch times come wherein he wil give his people his ordinances, not only in purity, but alſo in power; when the Lord ſhall be one, and his name one, <hi>Zach.</hi> 14.9. over all the earth.

               </label> Let our Anſwer bee viewed, and it will appeare that wee had juſt cauſe to premiſe thoſe diſtinctions of Formes of Prayer into pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and publike; and publike into ſuch as are impoſed by others, or compoſed and uſed by Miniſters themſelves before their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons; otherwiſe we muſt have involved ſuch in the Poſition, as wee doe not condemn. Now if your generall <hi>theſis</hi> juſtly admit ſuch limitation to publike impoſed Formes, where ſhall wee finde any ſet ſtinted impoſed Liturgies, but in Churches of the Papacy or Prelacy? no Reformed Churches ſtinting or impoſing their Formes of Prayer, but leaving Miniſters and people at much liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.

in generall, that ſo you might have to ſtay the ſeparation of people from your Liturgy, whereof you complaine: but by that it appeares plainly, what your chiefe ſcope and ayme was in the Poſition: according unto which wee thought it moſt ſafe and pertinent for us to anſwer. And this wee did the rather, for our reaſon mentioned in our letter, becauſe though all of us could not concurre to condemne all ſet Formes as unlawfull, yet wee could in this, <hi>viz.</hi> that though ſome ſet Forms may bee lawfull, yet it will not follow, that this of the Engliſh Liturgy is, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to remove all obſcurities, and breake all ſnares, and reſolve the queſtion in the true intent of it, wee were forced to diſtinguiſh of Formes, and ſo touch the true <hi>Helena</hi> of this controverſie; and therefore if any ſhall narrowly obſerve Mr. <hi>Ball</hi> his large defence of ſet Forms in generall, they ſhall finde thoſe wings ſpread forth in a very great breadth, to give ſome ſhelter and warmth to that particular Liturgie, then languiſhing, and haſtening (through age and feebleneſſe) towards its laſt end.</p>

               </label> 1 Concerning forms of Catechiſmes, and confeſſions of Faith, if religiouſly and perſpicuouſly framed, wee account them of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular uſe, (though abuſed by men) nor without ſome ſacred al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance: yet from hence to infer the like uſe of ſet Formes of prayers, neither our reaſons, nor any other will in force: for Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſmes and Confeſſions (as well as Pſalmes) in the nature of the thing, require in ſome ſenſe a ſet and limited Forme; but publike prayers, though they may admit of a ſet and comely order in the generall, to prevent errour; yet of their owne nature they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire no ſet Forme; for God gives us no new matter or doctrine daily to be beleeved, but he gives new matter of new affection in prayer daily.</p>
            <p n="2">2 If by ſet Forms of Catechiſmes and Confeſſions, bee meant (according to the termes of the Queſtion) ſtinted Formes, like ſtinted Liturgies, <hi>i. e.</hi> beyond, or ſhort of which, Miniſters may not teach, or Chriſtians beleeve and profeſſe, then wee ſhould ſay the ſame of theſe as wee doe of ſtinted Formes of Prayer; wee confeſſe there is danger in caſting by all Formes of Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Catechiſmes, leſt through the inſtability of ungroun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and heady men, pretending new light, or ſearching after fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther light, the Churches adhere to nothing: and their Faith (as the learned <hi>Leyden</hi> Profeſſors terme it) become <hi>fides horaria,</hi> or

               <hi>menſtrua,</hi> The faith of an houre or moneth, and then caſt it off the next. And on the other ſide there is danger, that by impoſing ſuch Confeſſions too far, that which is indeed <hi>further light</hi> be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt; wee therefore thinke it uſefull and needfull to pave out ſuch high wayes of Catechiſmes and Confeſſions, ſo as the ſubjects of Chriſt Jeſus our King and Law-giver may walke therein without ſhackles, reſerving liberty for further future light, in points leſſe cleare, yet ſtanding in a readineſſe alwayes to confeſſe and hold faſt the preſent truth which appeares moſt cleare.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Concerning Forms of bleſſing, baptizing, ſinging Scripture Pſalmes, there is a far differing reaſon from this caſe, for the Lord himſelfe hath left us Formes in theſe caſes, not onely for inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but allowing the uſe of the ſame, as <hi>Numb.</hi> 6.23, &amp;c. <hi>Luke</hi> 10.5. <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.20. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.30. and therefore ſuch may bee uſed as hee hath left; yet the Lord hath not impoſed (ſome of theſe at leaſt) to bee uſed alwayes and onely in his Churches, much leſſe doth hee allow any man to impoſe their own Forms upon his Churches, or conforme to ſuch as are tyrannouſly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.</p>

            <p>To reduce therefore this propoſition unto its true ſtate which the anſwer puts it in, which is thus, If the queſtion bee of joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in prayer with, and when that whole Liturgie is read, or where that which is uſed, (<hi>viz.</hi> though not the whole) is read by an unable and ungodly Miniſter: wee ſee not how it can bee lawfull to joyne, &amp;c. where that which is read by an unable and ungodly Miniſter, cannot have reference to the ſelect prayers, but onely was put in, to reach the whole caſe, leſt any ſhould ſay, may we not joyne, therefore if they read not all, (as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſuch doe not, for haſte to the Alehouſe, Beare-baitings, &amp;c.) And the caſe is ſo well known to our ſelves and others, what the manner of ſuch Prieſts is, how farre they are from making any choyce of ſelect prayers: or having any skill indeed ſo to doe; that if any bee more ſuperſtitious then others, they would

ſooneſt chooſe them; ſo that it was farre from our thoughts to impute it to them, to read the ſelect prayers onely. The queſtion being rightly ſtated, the argument will halt very much; For wee ſay, it is unlawfull in both reſpects, and the rather, when jointly conſidered; and therefore you ſhould firſt have juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the whole Liturgy, or ſo much as ſuch Idol-Prieſts uſe to read to bee lawfull, and alſo the ſtanding and calling of thoſe men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the argument can hold, both which you have wholly left naked without proofe, and argue onely about the lawfulneſſe of joyning with an ungodly Miniſter in the Ordinances of God, which will not reach this caſe. If one ſhould affirme it is unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to goe to Mattens or Evenſong, when the whole is read, or that which is read, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> done by a popiſh Prieſt, and you ſhould an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer then, it is either becauſe of the Prayers or the Prieſt. Not the firſt; for the prayers (if ſelect) may bee good, and faultleſſe, and not becauſe of the Prieſt, for then wee may never joyne with an ungodly Miniſter in the Ordinances of God: The anſwer would bee very imperfect and impertinent, and juſt ſo it is here in the frame of the reaſon, though the corruptions in that ſervice and this be not alike we grant. But before wee anſwer to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond part of your diſ-junction, let us conſider a little here once for all, the act of the people in joyning with the reading of this Liturgy, or ſo much of it, as is read uſually by ſuch Idol-prieſts. Firſt, concerning the Liturgy it ſelfe, if you reſpect the matter and forme, or manner of it, it would bee too tedious to rip up, what for matter hath been objected by the godly Reformers. Conſider but two things objected ſtrongly by Mr. <hi>Cartwright</hi> againſt the forme or manner of it. Firſt, that it is taken out of the Popiſh Maſſe-book, concerning which hee affirmeth, that although there were nothing in it unlawfull, or againſt the Word of God, (which ſaith hee) I wiſh there were not, yet no Word of God, no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, nor example of the Ancient Churches, Jewiſh or Chriſtian, will permit us to uſe the ſame formes and ceremonies (<hi>viz.</hi> with Papiſts) being neither commanded of God, nor ſuch as there may not bee as good as they, and rather better eſtabliſhed, yea, conſidering how neare the Papiſts live amongſt us, it were more ſafe to conforme to the Ceremonies of the Turks that are farre off. And this hee ſpeaketh of the forme of Liturgy, as well as Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, <hi>Cartw.</hi> reply to <hi>Whitgifts</hi> anſwer to the admonition to the Parliament, <hi>pag.</hi> 131, 132. And although you ſeeme to make
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:60763:25"/>
light of this objection, after <hi>page</hi> 15. end, yet in a like caſe, when <hi>Whitgift</hi> had ſaid, it is not materiall that Deanes, Canons came from the Pope; <hi>Cartwright</hi> replyeth thus; It is as if hee had ſaid, it skilleth not, if they came out of the bottomleſſe pit; for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever commeth from the Pope, who is Antichriſt, comes firſt from the Devill, <hi>Cartw. Reply, pag.</hi> 204.</p>
            <p>Secondly, hee objecteth that abſurd manner of chopping and interrupting the prayers, of which Mr. <hi>Cartwright</hi> ſaith, That if any man ſhould make ſuch a ſupplication to a Prince, he would thinke him to make his ſupplication before hee knew what to ask, or that hee had forgotten ſome piece of his ſuit;<note place="margin">Ibid. p. 138.</note> or that he were diſtracted in his underſtanding. Much more might bee added, but wee have onely touched this ſore, and in the words of that learned and zealous Reformer, that it may appeare, neither the opinion of that Booke, nor the reaſons againſt it, are ſo new or proper to the Separatiſts, as is pretended. Now what comfort can any godly conſcience have to joyn in, or conform unto ſuch a form of Worſhip as this is?</p>
            <p>Further conſider the adminiſtration of the Sacraments, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Book (as we ſpeak ſtill of joyning in it) who knows not, that ſuch muſt ſubject their children to that groſſe Idol of the croſſe, and ſee and approve the pollution of Gods Ordinances with the ſame: and at the Lords table joyne in that Idolatrous geſture of kneeling; and therefore how the godly can joyn law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in the whole, or ſuch parts as thoſe Idol-prieſts diſpenſe, let all Non-conformiſts judge; and it is well knowne, how ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly preciſe ſuch are, in preſſing all conformity to every ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture and ceremony preſcribed in their Booke, which they ſo idolize, as they have good cauſe, being that which maintaines them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if wee conſider the impoſition hereof by the Prelates and late ſtrict preſſing thereof upon the people to be preſent and conforme fully to it, as well as upon Miniſters to uſe it. The ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry yeelding of conformity thereto, doth miſerably caſt away the liberty purchaſed by Chriſt to his Churches, inthrall the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to Antichriſt, and lift up the power of Antichriſt in his tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous uſurpations upon the Churches of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, we might adde the dangerous conſequences and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals that follow from admitting this Liturgy, which being touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in our anſwer to the firſt Poſition, we here paſſe over.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:60763:25"/>Theſe things conſidered, it appeares, not onely that there was need to diſprove the firſt part of your disjunction, which you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined in ſtating the queſtion; but alſo the truth of the Poſition it ſelfe is confirmed. Now let us conſider your proof of the ſecond part of your disjunction; which is thus,</p>

            <p>Secondly, wee ſee no demonſtrative argument that the Prieſts and Phariſees were wholly unable for the worke of thoſe times, as theſe wee ſpeake of are for—: though the Prieſts, <hi>Eſay</hi> 56.10. were dumb dogs that cannot barke; yet it ſeemes by the place to be meant actually, rather then habitually, through their ſlumbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring or ſecurity there mentioned, not telling the people of their ſinnes, nor warning them of judgements, rather then of their totall inability. Men of good parts and able gifts may be actually ſuch dumb dogs, as ſeldome preach, or never to purpoſe, and bee ſpiritually ignorant through much prophaneneſſe, yet not totally deprived of common gifts: It is moſt evident that the Phariſees were blinde, yet taught the people, and hence the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples were permitted to heare them; but what is this to the queſtion, which is of unable, as well as of ungodly Miniſters?</p>

            <p>Fourthly, ſuppoſe ſome of them were not called of God, being not lineally deſcended of that tribe, yet thoſe things wherein the faithfull, Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and others did communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with them, were neceſſarily commanded of God, <hi>viz.</hi> ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, offerings, &amp;c. in the Temple, which ſeale of God we ſee not ſtamped upon this Liturgy in queſtion, to make it currant.

               </label> Firſt, wee muſt ſtill mind the Reader of the true and full ſtate of the queſtion, which in our anſwer is of joyning in prayer, with, and when that whole Liturgy is uſed, and hee that joynes with that whole Liturgie muſt needs bee ſuppoſed to have actuall communion with all the corruptions thereof what ever they bee, and therefore though this Propoſition reach to the practiſe of able and godly Miniſters, yet let none thinke wee plead herein ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from their miniſtery, but onely that people may not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme with them to any corruption in worſhip, and by this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition alſo the Author might eaſily have ſeene that wee denied the other (which was woven in with this) not becauſe of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſſe of the Miniſter alone as hee carried his diſpute, but chiefly in reſpect of the corruptions of the worſhip, together with the unlawfulneſſe of ſuch a miniſtery that is both unable and ungodly.</p>

               <hi>And if preſence at formes of prayer bee not lawfull by reaſon of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions alledged, there can bee no viſible ſocietie named, ſince</hi> 200. <hi>yeeres after Chriſt or thereabout, wherein a Chriſtian might lawfully joyne in prayer, reading the Scriptures, hearing the word, or participation of the Sacraments; their Doctrines, prayers, rights being leſſe pure then ours: but no man wee hope will bee ſo bold as to affirme the ſtate of the Churches

               </label> Firſt, this argument holds as ſtrongly for conformitie to the ceremonies as to the whole booke of Common Prayers, as was ſaid before.</p>
            <p>Secondly, this is a dangerous kind of reaſoning from the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of the faithfull in corrupt times of the Church, eſpecially when they are declining, and growing clouds of darkeneſſe, and ſuperſtition overſpread the Churches. It is no breach of charitie to thinke that through the iniquitie of the times, the godly lived in many evils through ignorance and weakeneſſe which after light is come into the Churches wee ought to abandon wholly; theſe are times of light and of the conſumption of Antichriſt, and time for us to aboliſh his Liturgies and corrupt formes of worſhip as well as Images, ceremonies, &amp;c. Who doe not pitie the weakneſſe of godly <hi>Bilny</hi> and others that ſeeing ſome groſſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions were yet ſo devoutly obedient to the Church (as they called it) in many groſſe ſuperſtitions? and the like may bee ſaid of thoſe former times, and wee ſee not but this reaſon will goe farre in juſtification of communion with many falſe worſhips of Antichriſts that are not groſly idolatrous.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it is a great charge upon thoſe times to ſay no viſible ſocietie throughout the world can bee named ſince 200. yeeres af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſt, that was not leſſe pure then England in Doctrine, rites, &amp;c. It may bee, that as generally Churches were corrupt, ſo they contemned and cenſured ſuch as profeſſed more puritie: but that there were ſome viſible aſſemblies more pure may bee conceived by that teſtimony given to <hi>Aerius</hi> and many orthodox Chriſtians with him, though condemned for a Hereticke, in that which wee all now hold to bee an undoubted truth; alſo after the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> caſting off the Pope and his will worſhips, and the following re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches, thoſe of <hi>Scotland, Geneva,</hi> and divers others in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Switſerland, &amp;c.</hi> whoſe Doctrines, rites and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations wee doubt not will bee confeſſed more pure then Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Churches. It would bee too tedious, and in theſe knowing times needleſſe to ſearch all records and to compare the puritie of the prayers, and rites of theſe with former times, wee read of very few formes uſed for 300. yeeres, ſome ſhort ones they had which are retained yet in our Liturgie, with many more, and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:60763:29"/>
theſe formes they had, not impoſed nor ſtinted, which is the great offence of this, untill about the yeere 406. and there wee read in the <hi>Milevitan</hi> Councell that no prayers ſhould bee uſed in Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches but what were either compoſed of able and ſufficient men, or approved by the Synods, and this was determined onely in regard of the ignorant Miniſtery of thoſe contentious and hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call times,<note place="margin">Conc. Miliv. Can. <hi>12.</hi>
               </note> as <hi>Chemnitius</hi> obſerves, <hi>ne forte aliquid contra fidem vel per ignorantiam, vel per minus ſtudium ſit compoſitum.</hi> If the Roman Biſhops did multiply (as indeed they did exceſſively (unleſſe their owne admirers erre groſſely) rites and formes of prayer, yet it is well knowne how long it was ere the Churches in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſubmitted to their power, ſo that this compariſon might well have beene ſpared. To conclude, though wee ſay not that all Churches ſince 200. yeeres after Chriſt were ſo miſerably decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the faithfull might not without ſinne communicate with them, yet wee may bee bold to ſay many of them were ſo cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, that the faithfull did not, nor could not communicate in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny parts of Gods worſhip without ſinnes of ignorance confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the corruptions themſelves; and that if they had ſeene and diſcovered the evill of them, they ought, and we beleeve would have abſtained from divers ordinances in regard of the corrupt adminiſtrations of them; yea after all meanes uſed to purge them out, and not prevailing, they ought and would have withdrawn themſelves to more pure Churches, or erected ſuch amongſt themſelves.</p>

               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:60763:29"/>Firſt, we diſtinguiſh not here between perſonall and miniſteriall faults, but object againſt the perſonall act of him that joynes with that whole Liturgie, and ſo in the corruptions of it, as hee muſt needs doe, that joyns with the whole, not onely ſaying <hi>Amen</hi> to them, but as is knowne he takes his ſhare in thoſe ſhreds of prayers, Reſponds, &amp;c. which in Mr. <hi>Cartwrights</hi> judgement is ſo abſurd, as makes a man ſeeme out of his wits. And therefore his perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, actuall conformitie muſt needs carry guilt, and therefore there is more then ſimple preſence in this caſe, as is cleare to any underſtanding.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it is not all one whether the faults bee knowne, or not knowne beforehand, as appeares plainely, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.27, 28, 29. where wee ſee, if a man come to a feaſt, and know not they eate with reference to the Idoll, nor that any take offence, he may eate without asking any queſtion: but if hee know ſuch things, he may not eate.</p>
            <p>Beſides, publique ſinfull actions of Miniſters are either, 1 Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental &amp; occaſional, or 2ly. known &amp; appointed in a ſtated ſervice; now the frailties of a Miniſter, which accidentally fall in and are not known before, nor are any part and eſſence of the ſervice, unto which men that come, doe or ſhould take themſelves to bee called, hinder not communion; becauſe they doe not <hi>prae ſe ferre</hi> by their preſence to attend and obſerve them, but the corruptions of the Liturgie are knowne and appointed, and to which and with which the impoſers call others to joyne as in a ſtated ſervice to God; the uſe of which if it bee an humane frailtie in Gods Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, not yet convinced of the evill thereof, yet for thoſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate herein, who know ſuch evills, have ſurely paſſed the bounds of frailtie and infirmitie; becauſe in this action of prayer there is not onely communion by way of preſence, as it is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the word, but communion of action: publique prayer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the common action of the whole Church towards God. There can be no prayer by any man offered to God, but there will be ſome humane frailties attending on it; if therefore for this cauſe wee ſhould reject communion in prayer, wee ſhould reject the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of God, and never joyne in any prayer in this world; but the corruptions of the Liturgie are not ſuch, but that they may bee more eaſily caſt off, then kept.</p>
            <p>This caſe ſtands not in tolerating faults in another (as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply makes it) but in actuall joyning with the ſinnes of another,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:60763:30"/>
wherein hee that joyneth is involved, and therefore whether they bee corruptions, that may bee tolerated or not in another, yet if ſinnes, they may not bee practiſed and ſo joyned in with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. And therefore the caſe you put of communion with any perſon obſtinate in errour, till hee may bee convinced, is nothing to this purpoſe. For wee muſt not joyne with him in his error, no not an houre, though wee may tolerate him a moneth.</p>

               <hi>And why ſuch corruptions ſhould not bee aſcribed to humane frailtie, we ſee not. For if a godly Miniſter make uſe of a booke, in things which hee judges lawfull for matter and manner, the corruption of him that uſeth it, according to his judgement, from what cauſe can it ſpring but humane ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and frailtie?</hi>

            <p>Secondly, our queſtion is not whether the Miniſter uſe the book of humane frailtie, but whether the worſhip offered therein, bee not ſo corrupt for matter and manner, as puts a great difference betweene it, and the prayers of a Miniſter that may bee ſubject to faylings of humane frailtie. Wee doubt not, but <hi>Bilney, Latimer, &amp;c.</hi> uſed the prayers and ceremonies of the Church of Rome, out of humane frailtie, yet the ſervice it ſelfe and thoſe ceremonies of holy water, holy bread, &amp;c. which <hi>Latimer</hi> turned to as good uſe, as hee could, were evill and no way to bee conformed unto by the godly.</p>

frailtie, that is, ignorantly and in ſome meaſure perverſely, yet ſuch frailties, though they are to bee very long tolerated in the man, yet every humane frailtie is not ſo to bee tolerated, as to bee communicated with; for the groſſeſt Idolatry in Popery may in this ſenſe, if ignorantly done, bee accounted humane frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. It is true, wee may bee freed from communicating in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſinne two wayes. 1. By bearing witneſſe againſt his ſinne, or 2ly by withdrawing from the perſon committing it. There were times wherein the Lord raiſed up witneſſes againſt the grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abominations of Antichriſt for many yeeres; and there are times (as <hi>Cameron</hi> well obſerves) wherein the Lord commands his people not onely to beare witneſſe, but to come out of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon.</hi> The caſe may be ſo put as that wee may quit our hands from communicating with other men, in their ſinfull worſhip, by bearing witneſſe onely againſt the ſinne, yet communicating with them in the reſt; <hi>&amp; è eonira</hi> the circumſtances may bee ſuch, as that wee beſt free our ſelves from ſinne, by withdrawing from them in ſuch acts.

Let a man bring himſelfe, and never ſo godly deſires, yet if hee will joyne in a knowne corrupt ſervice, will his godly deſires excuſe him? ſhall not his broken abſurd reſponds, his ſtanding at the Creed, knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at the Sacrament, &amp;c. all which hee muſt doe, if hee joyne in the whole Liturgie, ſhall none of theſe cleave to his ſacrifice? what though the Miniſter offer the ſervice? ſo did the Prieſt the ſacrifice; But both in the name of the people, and they joyning with him in offering the ſame to God. 3ly. Concerning <hi>Malach.</hi> 1.13, 14. the more adviſedly wee conſider it, the more perſwaded wee are, the Lord allow us to make ſuch application of the truth contained in it, and wee thinke others will bee of our mind, not onely in reſpect of the ſimilitude that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> in this caſe, with that in <hi>Malachi,</hi> but alſo if wee conſider, what an argument the Lord uſeth to convince them of their corruptions and careleſneſſe in his ſervice, Verſe 11. wherein the Lord upbraids the Jewes and provokes them to Jealouſie, as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes, by decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the reverend eſteeme of his name amongſt the heathen, and that every where Incenſe ſhould bee offered and a pure offering to his name. And what is that Incenſe, and pure offering, but the pure prayers, and worſhip of God that ſhould be in all Gentile Churches under the Goſpell? as <hi>Tertullian, Euſebius, Jerom</hi> and <hi>Auſtin</hi> with others expound it. And hee applies it againe, Verſe 14. I am a great King, and my name ſhall bee great amongſt the heathen: If then the Lord oppoſe the pure prayers and worſhip of Gentile Churches to the corrupt careleſſe ſacrifices of the Jewes, the application is not onely ſutable, but the place containes a ſad admonition to all Gentile Churches, that by their corrupt worſhips, and Incenſe, ſo farre fruſtrate (as it were) Gods

               <hi>Your third Propoſition.

            </p>
            <p n="1">1 <hi>Wee cannot conceive how you ſhould imagine the practiſe of a godly Miniſter in reading ſome few ſelect prayers to bee ſcandalous, or offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive in the Congregations, when the people generally in their aſſemblies and in the whole land were perſwaded of the lawfulneſſe of that courſe, till now of late times ſome have beene drawne away to ſeparate; who yet by warrant of Scripture produce nothing of weight, to countenance that practiſe.</hi>

               </label> Concerning this Propoſition, wee doe ingenuouſly confeſſe, that it may ſeeme over rigid and tending to ſeparation, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we will not wholly juſtifie the ſame: yet diverſe things there bee, which may much mitigate the ſeeming rigidneſſe of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1 In the words of the anſwer, where wee doe not determine any thing poſitively, wee doe not impute ſinne to any in ſuch a caſe, wee ſay onely that wee are not <hi>without feate,</hi> leſt it may bee found unlawfull, where any ſcandall, unlawfull honour, or ſinfull li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting bee found in the Miniſters: and if our feares bee needleſſe, wee hope, ſuch as know how jealous the Lord is in matters of his worſhip will eaſily forgive us.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Becauſe you marvell wee ſhould bee ſo timerous in this caſe, wee ſhall give you ſome reaſons of it, which perhaps may abate much the marvell or wonder.</p>
            <p>Firſt, let it bee remembred that theſe ſelect prayers are yet a part of that Liturgie, which is acknowledged to bee corrupt in matter and manner and clogged with ſuch evill conſequences as are afore touched; Taken out of the Maſſe-booke, &amp;c. And Maſter <hi>Parker</hi> (who was no ſeparatiſt) doubts not to affirme, that the touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Antichriſts things maketh uncleane, for which hee cites, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17. <hi>Haggai</hi> 2.14. <hi>John</hi> 4.23. <hi>Park of the Croſſe, part</hi> 1. <hi>pag.</hi> 137.</p>
            <p>Secondly, let it be conſidered that this booke is impoſed by an unlawfull Antichriſtian authoritie of the Prelates, to whom to give place and ſubjection in any thing is juſtly to bee queſtioned.
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:60763:32"/>
And wee know that a man may acknowledge his fealtie and hold his Lands of the Lord of the Manner by a ſmall rent, as well as by a greater.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, conſider this corrupt Service-booke hath beene over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long tolerated and borne withall in the Engliſh Churches: it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth not ſo honorable a buriall as the Jewiſh worſhip: but hath ſtunke above ground twice 40. yeeres, in the noſtrills of many godly, who breathed in the pure ayre of the holy Scripture, being witneſſed againſt by the writings and ſufferings of many godly Miniſters and Chriſtians in England and Scotland.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, many godly men (it is well knowne) have been (of late times eſpecially) offended at many good Miniſters ſilence in theſe things, that they would no more plainely and boldly diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the corruptions in that booke, and at their compliance with the ſame.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, theſe are times of more light, whereby the Lord is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming Antichriſt, with the breath of his mouth. And therefore we have cauſe the more to feare how we meddle with any thing of his.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, conſider the ſeaſon when this anſwer was ſent, was it not at a time, when ſuperſtitious opinions of the whole booke and the ceremonies thereof, were growne to a great height in the mindes and hearts of very many? when divers ſuperſtitious Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh worſhips, as bowing at the name of Jeſus, reading at the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſet Altar-wiſe, &amp;c. were added to the heape of former corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? when the tyranny of the Prelates raged in the preſſing of the booke, and their other humane inventions? when many Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and people (well thought of by the beſt) were carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ſhamefully with theſe things? when many weake Chriſtians were ſtaggering and wavering and looking at the judgement and practiſe of their guides, ready to ſtand or fall with them?</p>
            <p>Laſtly, conſider that things lawfull in themſelves may bee inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient; becauſe offenſive in their uſe, and ſo farre unlawfull; which offence wee chiefly looked at in this act, as appeares by our anſwer.</p>
            <p>Let all theſe things bee laid together and weighed in an equall ballance (which wee hope our brethren are now at ſome libertie and leaſure to doe) and let the conſciences of all ſpeake, whether it was not high time, for all the godly in England to take unto them that zeale and courage, which was ſoone after in our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:60763:33"/>
of Scotland, to caſt off and wholly abandon the book it ſelf and all the formes of it, and uſe of the ſame in every part and peece thereof? At leaſt wee hope you will ceaſe to marvell at our timerouſneſſe of ſuch a ſeaſon, how ever wee confeſſe, wee have ſometime been more bold in the darke.</p>
            <p>Theſe conſiderations premiſed, as they may in a great meaſure abate the ſeeming rigour of the propoſition: ſo they will much take off the edge of the Reply. For it will appeare that all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie of Miniſters and people to any parcells of that booke, at ſuch a ſeaſon as this was, is a farre differing caſe from thoſe that are put in ſome of the replies.</p>
            <p n="1">1 To the firſt reply then, wherein you put it beyond imagination, that ſuch a practiſe ſhould bee ſcandalous or offenſive, wee know not what you have obſerved in ſome particular congregations neere you: but what ever have beene the opinions of men former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerning this practiſe, yet you know that the booke in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall hath been condemned of all godly reformers, and the uſe of any part of it hath been counted burdenſome to many for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons named. But of later times, as the booke and conformitie thereto was urged more hotly, ſo the ſpirits of very many grew more zealous againſt it, and began to loath it, and to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw wholly from it; many very inquiſitive about the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe or unlawfulneſſe of joyning with it at all, and your ſelves complaine of the withdrawing of many, from joyning in the ordinances, where it was uſed, ſo that wee ſee not, but at leaſt in ſome perſons and at ſome places and times it might probably bee offenſive and ſcandalous ſo to practiſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Wee looked not onely to the offence of thoſe in your owne congregations, but to the imboldning and hardning of Papiſts in honouring any part of their portuiſes, above the formes of other reformed Churches abroad; and you cannot bee ignorant how many of the Lords witneſſes now aſleepe have teſtified of the offence and danger thereof.</p>

               </label> Firſt, wee judge the whole booke an Idolothyte, and whence you gather, that wee confeſſe the contrary of any part of it, as it ſtands apart in relation to that whole, wee know not.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that it was taken out of the Maſſe booke, was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the confeſſion of King <hi>Edward</hi>; and other evidences are many; but you ſay, not in ſuch ſenſe as wee object. But rather, <hi>è contra Maſſe, &amp;c.</hi> added to it, &amp;c. But where to finde ſuch a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacy bequeathed to the Church in the Teſtament of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, wee could never yet ſee: So that wee rather feare all thoſe formes of prayer, of marriage, burialls, viſitations of the ſick, confirmation, &amp;c. are rather the copper counterfeit coyne, of a well growne Antichriſt, whereby he couſened the Churches, when hee ſtole away the golden Legacy of Chriſt, rather then any part of the true Churches Legacy: and therefore it had been more happy for the Churches that they had never challenged the ſame, but let the theefes preſcription to have been a good plea to hold them ſtill: this further we adde, when we ſay it was taken out of the Maſſe-booke, wee underſtand Maſſe-booke in a large ſenſe, (as it is commonly taken) for to ſpeake narrowly it was col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected out of three Popiſh bookes, the firſt part of publique Prayers, <hi>exbreviario</hi>; the ſecond part, <hi>viz.</hi> the order of admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring Sacraments, Matrimony, viſiting the ſick and burialls, <hi>è Rituali</hi>; 3. the order of conſecration in the Supper, the Epiſtles and Goſpels, and Collects, <hi>è Miſſali,</hi> as the forme of conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Biſhops and Prieſts was taken <hi>è Pontificali,</hi> as the Author of <hi>Altare Damaſc.</hi> ſhews, pag. 612.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, becauſe thoſe words, Popery is a ſcab, &amp;c. may bee a ſeed of much evill, an Egge out of which a Serpent may bee hatched, if men zealous of mouldy formes may but have time againe to ſet upon it, if the wheele of theſe evill times, (through Gods judgement on this wanton age) turne the Prelates or other zelotes for this Liturgie uppermoſt, wee ſhall therefore crave li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie to examine this ſpeech more narrowly. And becauſe (as it is ſaid) <hi>unumquodque ex ſuâ origine rectiſſime judicatur,</hi> wee ſhall trace the ſteps of the firſt times and ſo downeward, to ſee what
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:60763:34"/>
ſound parts of Liturgie there was, on which this ſcab is ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to grow.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Our bleſſed Saviour taught his Diſciples a bleſſed forme, which though it may bee lawfully and comfortably uſed, the rather, not being of mans, but the Lords compoſing: yet it is evident hee never appointed his people to uſe it as their onely forme, and therefore the Apoſtles in the primitive Church, in that heavenly prayer, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. did not attend to the words and forme of this prayer, though they might have this in their eye, as the comon rule and direction how to powre out their prayers to God, for particular things, which may be an everlaſting wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe againſt their uſurpations, that will limit the Churches to their formes which the Lord Chriſt would not doe to his owne.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In the firſt 300. yeeres after Chriſt, wee read of few formes, that the Churches uſed, and thoſe rather ſhort ejaculations, then ſet formes, but contrarily wee read frequently of the exerciſe of their gifts in prayer. They prayed <hi>ſine monitore, quia de pectore,</hi> ſaith <hi>Tertullian,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tertull. Apol. cap. <hi>30.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>i. e.</hi> They prayed without a Promptour, becauſe from the heart, which as <hi>Zephirus</hi> obſerves was in oppoſition to the prompted formes then in uſe amongſt the Pagans. Wee read alſo <hi>what</hi> they prayed for, <hi>viz. pro inimicis, pro imperatoribus, pro ſtatu ſeculi<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> pro morà finis, &amp;c.</hi> but of any ſet formes we read not. Their perſecutions and dayes of afflictions preſerved them from formalitie in prayer, and taught them how to finde their hearts and knees, and tongues, to poure out their ſoules to God, while under the Altar they were pouring out their blood.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But after the Churches had enjoyed peace for ſome ſpace of time, (wherein ſecuritie uſually makes inſenſible, and inſenſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe formall) then indeed wee read of ſet and impoſed formes, which the rather prevailed in regard of the groſſe and palpable ignorance of a blind miniſtry, under a more learned Prelacy, and therefore it is well obſerved by <hi>Chemnitius</hi> that the third Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Carthage decreed this; <hi>ut nemo in precibus, &amp;c. viz.</hi> that no Miniſter in his prayers either names the Father for the Sonne or the Sonne for the Father, but when hee comes to the Altar, to direct his prayers alwayes to God the Father, and that no man uſe his owne formes, till hee have conferred and ſhewed his formes to men more able, which wee finde ſometime to bee the Synod.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:60763:34"/>4 After theſe times they added the commemoration of Saints to their Prayers and Letanies,<note place="margin">Vid. Chemnit. Ex. de Innoc. Sanctorum.</note> as appears from manifold inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, whereof take but this one imputed to <hi>Chryſoſtome: Sanctiſſimae Deiparae &amp; ſemper Virginis Mariae, cum omnibus ſanctis, memoriam agentes, nos ipſos &amp; omnem vitam noſtram Chriſto Deo noſtro commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.</hi> Which Letanies at firſt being uſed more ſeldome at ſome times of the year, afterwards grew into ordinary uſe, to every end of which the people added, Lord have mercy upon us, and <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>audi Domine,</hi> We beſeech thee to hear us good Lord.</p>
            <p n="5">5 From commemoration of Saints, (being ſo near the brink) they ſoon came on to invocation of them, firſt in private prayers, then in publick, and that by degrees. For firſt, they called upon Chriſt to hear their interceſſions for them. <hi>Interceſſionibus San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorum tuorum, Salvator, ſalva nos:</hi> and thence they fell to direct and immediate invocation of them. <hi>Maria Deo ſupplica, ut ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas noſtras ſalvet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6 At laſt they became ſo ſuperſtitious in their Letanies or Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies, that praying was magnified above all preaching, and almoſt all preaching was changed into formall, corrupt, and blind praying; and thus it was generally in the Churches, till about the ſixt Century, as (if need were) might be ſhewed at large.</p>
            <p n="7">7 Though other Churches were thus over-grown with Forms of Worſhip, yet the <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhops eſpecially, did multiply Forms and ſuperſtitious<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Rites exceſſively. <hi>Rome</hi> being (in Gods ſecret Providence) left to become the very ſeat and throne of Antichriſt. The Biſhops themſelves alſo finding it exceeding hard to bring in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ligion of Chriſt, without conforming to the Pagan rites, as <hi>Caſaubon</hi> obſerves. For it appears even in the time of <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> wherein Chriſtianity was riſen to a great head,<note place="margin">Vid. <hi>Birth of Hereſies, out of</hi> Elaſopolitans Comment.</note> the Senate being ſent unto by him to renounce their Pagan Religion, and receive the law of Chriſt, they returned anſwer that they would not, but that they would obſerve the ancient law <hi>Pompi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi> to avoid the ruine of the Common-wealth, which they fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red might come by the change of Religion. The <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhops alſo for 400 years together, could never obtain of the Senate, nor multitudes of the <hi>Roman</hi> Idolaters, to renounce their inveterate Idolatry, and receive the Goſpel. Hence they conformed their Rites and Ceremonies to the Pagan and Idolatrous cuſtomes, the better to allure them to Chriſt according to their carnalll po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy.
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:60763:35"/>
We finde all the principal parts of the Maſſe to be borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Idolatrous Pagans, and to have their originall from <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> that Conjurer, who lived 700 years before Chriſt, to adorn and deck (as the Biſhops thought) the Religion of Chriſt Jeſus, to the which with much ado at laſt the <hi>Romans</hi> were converted. To which principall parts, <hi>viz.</hi> Veſtments, Holy-water, the Confiteor, Organs, Incenſe, Offertory, &amp;c. other deckings were added alſo, as divers Letanies, and the Kurie Elyſon to be ſung nine times, invented by <hi>Gregory</hi> a Monk at firſt, well-ſtudied in the laws of <hi>Numa</hi> and <hi>Tullus Hoſtilius: Dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> (as <hi>Platina</hi> and <hi>Sabellius</hi> ſhew) inriched it with <hi>Gloria Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tri, &amp;c. i. e.</hi> Glory be to the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt. <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius,</hi> with an <hi>Agnus Dei,</hi> to be ſung three times. <hi>Alexander</hi> and other Biſhops added the Canon of the Maſſe; others, the Epiſtles and Goſpels: The Graduall and Collects were added by <hi>Gelaſius, anno</hi> 493. The <hi>Gloria in excelſis</hi> by <hi>Symmachus</hi> 508. At laſt came the Hoſt in about 1062. Much more might be ſaid. All which when we conſider, we confeſs we are puſled to diſcern the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſound part and the ſcab. For if the principal formalities of the Maſſe (out of which our Liturgy was taken; as is confeſſed) aroſe out of a politick puſh to conform the Chriſtian to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan Religion, and the deckings of it, from the itching humor of the <hi>Roman</hi> buſie Biſhops, admirers of humane inventions and Ceremonies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> let the Reader then judge what ſound parts are left beſide the ſcab. We do not ſpeak this to condemn every thing for the matter of it that is in the Common-Prayer-book: Yea, we honor the affection and piety of the firſt Reformers, and the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then, that were glad to hear Prayers in their own to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>e, and according to the glimmering light of thoſe times, aymed at the winning of Papiſts to the true Religion by ſuch a Form of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. But now ſince experience hath taught, it rather hardens them againſt the truth, then draws them toward it; when we ſee the preſſing of it is rather a temptation to conform to Popery, then otherwiſe; we verily beleeve, if they had lived in theſe times of further light, they would have born witneſſe againſt it, as others have done.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, though the originall had been good (which yet is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary) we may anſwer in the words of <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> to ſuch as did plead for a lawfull preſence at Maſſe,<note place="margin">Pet.

               <hi>TO the firſt conſideration: If by the Church be underſtood the ſociety of men profeſſing the entire faith, the ſeales are given to it, as peculiar priviledges, but if you underſtand a Congregationall aſſembly, the ſeales were never appropriated to it.</hi>

               </label> 1 Our meaning is plain in the ſecond ſenſe, as may appear by the reaſons alledged againſt any ſuch univerſall Church, as inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted and politicall, wherein the ſeales are diſpenſed, which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons you anſwer not, but grant there is no ſuch Catholick Church in our ſenſe, <hi>pag.</hi> 21. And if no ſuch Church wherein the ſeales are adminiſtred, as we proved, then the cauſe it ſelf is yeelded, and the ſeales muſt belong to particular Churches.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Seeing the main hinge of this queſtion turns upon this point, to what Church the adminiſtration and participation of the ſeals belong, wee ſhall a little further open our ſelves in this point. And becauſe we affect and ſtudy peace with truth; we ſhall freely acknowledge,</p>
            <p>Firſt, that as there is an inviſible Church and Body of Chriſt, conſiſting of all the elect, effectually called throughout the world in all ages of it, the whole family in heaven and earth: ſo unto Jeſus Chriſt, all the viſible beleevers and Churches of the world, are as one body to him, he governing, protecting, inſtructing all as his viſible body.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we acknowledge a viſible communion of all the true Churches of the Lord Jeſus, in all offices of brotherly love, and in the holy things of Chriſt, ſo far as may appear, the Lord have ordained and commanded, and by his Providence called them to exerciſe one with another.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, we grant that all true beleevers, where-ever they bee, have by faith in Chriſt, a true right and intereſt unto Jeſus Chriſt and all his benefits, whatſoever he hath purchaſed for them; but here we muſt firſt diſtinguiſh of theſe benefits of Chriſt, whereof ſome are meerly ſpirituall, inward, and flowing immediately from Chriſt unto them; and therefore peculiar to true beleevers, as juſtification, ſanctification, adoption, acceſſe to God in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, &amp;c. ſome are outward and tending to the help and furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of our ſpirituall communion with Chriſt, being outward and viſible meanes thereof; and therefore are alſo extended to
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:60763:38"/>
hypocrites being viſible beleevers, as the Miniſtery of the Word, Seals, Church-diſcipline, &amp;c. And theſe cannot be diſpenſed by Chriſt immediately nor ordinarily, but by means of a viſible Church. 2. We diſtinguiſh of right to theſe outward benefits of Chriſt; which is either remote, called, <hi>jus ad rem</hi>; or near, and immediate, called, <hi>jus in re</hi>; right to the enjoyment and frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. Now in the firſt ſenſe we grant, all viſible beleevers have a right to ſeals, &amp;c. But the immediate fruition of them, they muſt have <hi>mediante Eccleſiâ viſibili</hi>: now here lyes the true ſtate of the queſtion, Whether the Lord Jeſus have ordained an univerſall viſible Church, in which, and unto which, by the Officers thereof all theſe outward viſible priviledges and means of Grace, are to be diſpenſed and immediately enjoyed of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; or whether (not the remote right, but) the immediate frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and adminiſtration of all theſe ordinances by the inſtitution of Chriſt, be given to particular viſible Churches; and ſurely to whom one of theſe is given, all are given: For there is the ſame nature, reaſon, and uſe of all, Miniſtry of the Word, Seals, Diſcipline, all are outward ordinances, priviledges, means of Grace, belonging to the viſible Church, where Chriſt hath given one, he hath given all. But we muſt confeſſe, however you call this, A new Church way, it is new to us to read ſo much of late, of ſuch a Catholick Church, to which adminiſtration of Seals, Cenſures, &amp;c. belong. We are yet of the opinion of <hi>Baynes, Parker,</hi> and <hi>Cartwright, &amp;c.</hi> that have againſt Papiſts and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates maintained, that in the new Teſtament there is no <hi>inſtituted</hi> Catholick, Nationall, or Provinciall Church; but onely the Church of a particular Congregation, both for the reaſons alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in our Anſwer, as alſo for the impoſſibility thereof in the days of the New Teſtament, when the Lord Jeſus ſent his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles into all the world; therefore impoſſible both in regard of diſtance of place, and variety of language almoſt ever to meet in one, ſo much as by repreſentation, and that not onely by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, as may befall a particular Church, by ſickneſs, perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp;c. but by the neceſſity of nature and invincible hinderances foreſeen by Chriſt, and intended by him. And therfore, as the Lord limiting his Church to one Nation, united it into that form of a Nationall Church, ordaining one place, ſtated times and duties of Worſhip, and one Government for the ſame: ſo now the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ord neglecting all ſuch things, hath ordained a compleat admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:60763:39"/>
of all his ordinances in particular Congregations, and therefore if there be no other inſtituted viſible Church but of a Congregation, and Seals in their adminiſtration be given to the Church, our firſt conſideration will ſtill hold firm. But ſeeing in ſo vaſt a ſubject to ſay little, is to ſay nothing; and there is ſcarce any Truth in this wilie age but is almoſt diſputed out of counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and much darkned with humane evaſions; and ſeeing much depends upon this controverſie, it may be ſo moſt uſefull before we come to the defence of our argument to take into conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the nature and order of the viſible Church of Chriſt Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and particular. We are not ignorant of the knots and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of this queſtion, which of late have ſo much exerciſed the minds of many Godly-learned: And we think the notions of a Catholick Church, as it is now held, being but newly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up amongſt-godly Reformers, who formerly ran in another channell, (as is ingenuouſly confeſſed by ſome according to the truth) this new-birth ſeems not yet ſo formed to its diſtinct pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions, as time may bring it unto: and it might make us afraid (being the weakeſt of many) to venture upon ſo diffuſe and knotty a queſtion, when we look upon our own inſufficiency to ſuch a task, and the Learned labors of ſuch in this Point, whom we reverence in the Lord: yet, when we conſider of what great weight and moment the clearing up of this Truth would be unto the orderly proceedings of the great Work of Reformation in hand; 2 How unavoydably it lyes in our way in this Work the Lord hath called us unto; and that he ſometimes doth vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to ſpeak by weak ones, that the praiſe may be his own, in hope of his bleſſed guidance which we depend upon herein, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the light of his Word in our hands, we ſhall (rather as learners then otherwiſe) venture to propound what is ſuggeſted to us herein.

And hence it is ſaid, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.14. <hi>Beleevers</hi> were added; firſt they were beleevers, ſtanding in that ſpirituall relation to Chriſt and his whole body, and then added to the Church by viſible combination.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Propoſition. </seg>5</label> There is no viſible ſociety of a Church who hath actuall and immediate right unto, and communion in the viſible government of Chriſt, and the diſpenſation of his inſtituted Worſhip and ordinances, but ſuch a Society as the Lord Jeſus hath in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel inſtituted and ordained for that end. We ſay actuall and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate right unto the ſame; for though a beleever, <hi>quâ</hi> beleever, have an immediate right, and actuall enjoyment of ſuch benefits of Chriſt as neceſſarily and immediately flow from his internall union with Chriſt, as juſtification, adoption, &amp;c. and ſuch right to Chriſtian communion with all the Saints in their prayers, gifts, &amp;c. as flow from his ſpirituall relation unto them; yea, and alſo he hath a true right to all benefits purchaſed by Chriſt in a due order and manner: yet we ſay <hi>inſtituted</hi> priviledges and ordinances doe not immediately flow from ſpirituall union and relation to Chriſt and his members, but are diſpenſed by Chriſt to his people mediately, and in ſuch an order as he hath in wiſdome
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:60763:40"/>
ordained: and this the nature of viſible government and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of Chriſt neceſſarily requires. And hence it is, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Church in its nature and eſſence, and in reſpect of its ſpirituall union and relation to Chriſt and one another, profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſame faith, &amp;c. have been always one and the ſame in all ages, yet both the viſible government and ordinances of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and alſo the inſtituted form and order of Church-ſocieties hath been various according to the wiſdome and will of Chriſt, whereby it appears, that the order, government, forms of viſible Church-ſocieties, to which actuall enjoyment of viſible ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces doe belong, cannot juſtly be deduced from the common nature of the Church Cathoilck, or any reſpects of reaſon or logicall notions under which it may fall: but onely this depends upon the will and pleaſure of Chriſt, who hath in all ages inſtituted the forms and orders of ſuch Societies to whom the actual enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of inſtituted ordinances was given: And hence the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for a nationall form of a Church to be in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as wel as in the Old, drawn from the common nature, eſſence, profeſſion of faith, &amp;c. of the Church in all ages, falls flat to the ground, for by the ſame reaſon it muſt then be in families onely now, as it was about <hi>Abrahams</hi> time.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Propoſition. </seg>6</label> Hence it follows that the true ſtate of this great diſpute about a Catholick Church (ſo far as tends to clear up to what Church the actuall adminiſtration of Church-government, and all inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted Worſhip belongs) doth not lye in the conſideration of the common nature, eſſence, unity, viſibility, or any other notions under which it may fall; but the true ſtate lyes here concerning the nature, order, form of ſuch viſible Societies, as Chriſt Jeſus by Divine inſtitution in the Goſpel hath reduced his viſible mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers unto, for the actuall and immediate enjoyment of all his inſtituted ordinances.</p>
            <p>And therefore (with due reſpect to the Godly-learned be it ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken) we conceive many large diſputes in this queſtion fall ſhort of the iſſue that is deſired and intended; for what if it be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: 1 That there is a Catholick viſible Church, which in ſome reſpects of reaſon (as Mr. <hi>Ball</hi> ſaith) is one that having <hi>partes vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibiles,</hi> is a <hi>totum viſibile.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 That the viſible Church is not onely a <hi>totum genericum,</hi> in relation to all the particular Congregations, as <hi>ſpecies ſpecialiſſimae,</hi>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:60763:41"/>
of a viſible Church in generall, (which reſpect of reaſon in ſome ſenſe we freely conſent unto) but alſo that it may fall under the notion of a <hi>totum integrale,</hi> as ſome contend, (though we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in this notion, they are ſo intangled in their own logicall principles, as that they cannot get out without breaking them, and flying to theologicall conſiderations) yet we ſay, what if that alſo be attained?</p>
            <p n="3">3 Yea further, what if this Catholick Church be in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects of reaſon and order of nature alſo the firſt Church, and particular Churches, <hi>ortae</hi>?</p>
            <p n="4">4 Yea further, what if it were gained alſo by ſuch diſputes, that the Keys and Officers, Ordinances, &amp;c. be given firſtly to this Catholick Church as to the object and end? We confeſſe we do not ſee that what our Brethren contend for, is by all this obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. For, firſt, if the univerſall number of viſible beleevers be one <hi>totum aggregatum</hi>; yet it will bee hard to prove that theſe are one inſtituted and politicall Society, that can enjoy viſible communion together in viſible Worſhip and government; and yet more hard to prove that by the inſtitution of Chriſt, theſe all are to be actually governed as one <hi>totum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, what though the members of the Church Catholick be in order of time before particular Churches, as being fit mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for them, and conſtituting of them? yet this proves not one politicall body before they combine, but rather the contrary.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, be it ſo that this Catholick Church is the firſt Church to which Chriſt hath firſtly given the Keys, Ordinances, Promiſes, &amp;c. for which Chriſt firſtly performed the Offices of King, Prieſt, and Prophet, and what elſe ſoever can be ſaid in this kinde; yet all this may be in this reſpect that Chriſt looked at this Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church firſtly as the chief object and end for whoſe ſake and good he ordained and gave all theſe things, and this will not carry the cauſe; for as the Church Catholick viſible in this ſenſe is the firſt Church in reſpect of the particulars, ſo the inviſible bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chriſt is in nature and priority the firſt Church in reſpect of viſible, as viſible; for Chriſt no doubt firſtly intends and gives all theſe things to the inviſible Church, as to the object and end of the ſame for whoſe good they are all ordained; rather then for the Catholick viſible Church, which containes many hypocrites and reprobates within the verge of it. But now if we ſpeak of a ſubject of the Keys, to which the actuall exerciſe and diſpenſation
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:60763:41"/>
of Keys and inſtituted Ordinances belong: who doe not ſee that in this ſenſe the inviſible Church <hi>quâ talis,</hi> cannot be that inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted Society to which the Keys, &amp;c. belong; and by the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the Catholick viſible Church <hi>quâ totum,</hi> and <hi>quâ</hi> Catholick, cannot be this inſtituted Society to which they are given. It is a known rule in Reaſon, that, That which is firſt in intention, is laſt in execution; and ſo it is here, firſt, Chriſt propounds this end to himſelf to gather, edifie, perfect, ſanctifie, ſave his Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.11, 12. &amp; 5.26. and therefore inſtitutes all ordinances as means to farther and attain this great deſign; but in execution he may (for all this) give the Keys and ordinances in regard of the immediate exerciſe to any form of viſible Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that he ſhall be pleaſed to inſtitute, and it may be that will prove the leaſt Society ſooner then a greater.</p>
            <p>And ſeeing our Brethren otherwiſe minded make much uſe of ſimilies in this diſpute: we hope it will not be amiſſe for us to illuſtrate what we ſay by a ſimilitude, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>tly to make our concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings the more plain to all whoſe edification we ſeek; and partly, to diſcover the invalidity of many diſcourſes of this nature; and becauſe <hi>ſimilia arguunt fidem<expan>
                     <am>

The ſimilitude is this, <hi>genus humanum,</hi> or mankinde in generall is the ſubject of Civill government in generall, and of all the priviledges thereof, as the object and the end: and let the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion be, whether this Catholick number of all mankinde is the firſt ſubject of all power of Civill government, and the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges thereof; and if ſo, whether ſuch conſequences will follow as our Brethren deduce from the unity, viſibility, and priority of the Catholich Church. Now we reduce what we intend into an Argument, thus: If all that can be ſaid from Scripture and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon concerning the unity, viſibility, and priority of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church, may as truly be affirmed upon like grounds of the Catholick body of mankinde, then <hi>á pari</hi> it will follow that there is no more one Catholick viſible inſtituted <hi>totum,</hi> that is the firſt ſubject of Church power and priviledges in the actuall exerciſe and enjoyment of the ſame, then that there is ſuch a Catholick body of mankinde that is the firſt ſubject of Civill power, &amp;c. and that actually doth or ought to govern and be governed as one Catholick body in communion: but it will appear from Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture and Reaſon,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.47<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> that the ſame things may be ſaid of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind that can be ſaid of the other; <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:60763:42"/>And it is proved <hi>per partes,</hi> thus: 1 <hi>For the unity</hi>; are not all mankinde oft in Scripture called the world? <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. <hi>So God loved the world,</hi> that is, mankinde in the world; which is one. So, frequently all mankinde is called man, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.5, 6, 7. <hi>I will not ſtrive with man, &amp;c.</hi> yea, it is one kingdom, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.11, 12, 13. which (if we view the whole Pſalm) muſt be underſtood of the generall government of Gods providence over all the world, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally mankinde therein, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.11, 12. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo that all is one kingdom, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.26. <hi>God hath made of one blood all Nations</hi>; all are one blood, all have their bounds ſet by God, &amp;c. that they might ſeek him, and feel after him; and as it is ſaid for one Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, becauſe it hath one Lord, one Faith, one Baptiſm, one Spirit, and are bound to love and pray one for the other, &amp;c. ſo there is a like unity here, for the whole number of mankinde hath one Lord and King over all, <hi>God who is King over all the earth called an head over all,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.11. yea, Jeſus Chriſt is Lord of Lords, and King of Kings, and head over all to the Church, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.22. <hi>All have one Law,</hi> the Morall Law, the common rule of equity and righteouſneſs whereby they are bound to walk to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God and one another, and this writ in the hearts of all; they have all one ſpirit of reaſon diſpoſing them to ſociety and mutuall offices of love, one faculty of ſpeaking to fit them for communion, one end to feel after God, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. and ſeek ye good of the whole kinde; all ought to love one another, deſire and ſeek the welfare of the whole, and of one another, <hi>Eſay</hi> 58.7. yea, the Lord as a common head by the working of his common Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and out of his love of mankinde, hath a common and conſtant influence into all, giving not onely life and breath, and all good things, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. but alſo all gifts of wiſdom, art, skill, for Government, &amp;c. to Kings, Judges, Fathers, Maſters, and all Officers of Civill government, for the good of the whole; and what ever elſe may be ſaid to prove the Catholick Church <hi>One,</hi> may here be applyed.</p>
            <p>And as for principles of reaſon, it is eaſie to conceive that all mankinde will fall either under the notion of one <hi>genus homo,</hi> whereof the <hi>individua</hi> are <hi>ſpecies ſpecialiſſimae,</hi> or in another reſpect all perſons, all Families, Cities, Kingdomes may (in a ſenſe) make one <hi>totum integrale,</hi> or <hi>aggregatum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, it is as evident that all this number of mankinde are one <hi>viſibile totum,</hi> by the arguments uſed for the viſible Catholick
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:60763:42"/>
Church, for that which hath viſible parts, is a viſible <hi>totum,</hi> it holds here as well as in the other caſe. Yea, if the Catholick Church be one viſible Body, becauſe it hath organs and viſible Officers in it, it will hold here, for all mankinde is but one Army of the Lord of Hoſts, who hath Armies of heaven, and Armies on earth, and in this Body God by his Providence hath ſet, and by his ordinance hath ordained Fathers, Maſters, Husbands, Judges, Kings, &amp;c. to govern in this Body of mankinde for the good of the whole. Ruling and ſubjection by the fifth Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of the Morall Law, which is in all mens hearts, is ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of God for the order, peace, and welfare of all mankind, and therefore why is not this by the ſame reaſon a <hi>totum viſibile</hi>?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, for <hi>Priority,</hi> it is clear, that as God hath firſtly in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and intention given Chriſt to the whole Church, then to this and that particular beleever, and the power of feeding and being fed and governed by ſhepheards. Firſt, to the whole race of ſheep. Secondly, to this or that flock. So in nature and Gods intention he hath firſtly given to the race of mankind power of being governed with Government and Governors, before they are given to this or that Family, City, Kingdom, &amp;c. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe what is ſaid of Promiſes, given to the Church Catholick firſtly; is it not as true here? Thoſe promiſes and bleſſings in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe and multiply, Subdue the earth and inhabite it. The feare and dread of you ſhall be on all beaſts: and all like promiſes and priviledges of marriage, of liberty to eat fleſh, &amp;c. mentioned, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. &amp; 9. and all over the Scripture, are they not in nature firſt given to mankinde? and then to this or that perſon, family, City? So if Church power, and all Officers and Offices be firſtly given to the Catholick Church, not to this or that particular Church: So it's here, when the Scripture ſaith, <hi>Submit to the higher Powers, for all Powers are of God, Rom.</hi> 13. <hi>By me,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>Kings reign, and Princes decree judgment,</hi> and ſuch like Scriptures; doth this firſtly belong to this or that Kingdome, City, &amp;c. and not rather that God hath firſtly ſet up and ordained Civil Powers for mankind, to be obeyed of all mankinde firſtly, and then in this or that ſtate. Is foederall holineſſe firſt the priviledge of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church? (which in a ſenſe we will not now contradict) ſo is legitimation, firſt the priviledge of married ſociety in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall in all mankinde, and then of this or that family. Are the members of particular Churches firſtly of the Catholick Church;
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:60763:43"/>
and is it not ſo here? the members of every family, city, &amp;c. firſt and laſt of the number of mankinde; and ſo when the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties are diſſolved, they are ſtill of mankinde: and doe not all Societies ſpring of mankinde, and are an additament and increaſe to it? the one is true as well as the other.</p>
            <p>It would be over tedious to follow this parallel ſo farre as wee might, theſe may be ſufficient inſtances to guide the Reader to apply whatever elſe is, or can be ſaid in this kinde from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon nature and logicall notions under which the Catholick Church viſible may be conſidered: What is ſaid that may more properly concern the caſe under the notion of an inſtituted Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, we ſhall conſider in due place.</p>
            <p>Now from that which hath been ſaid, the Concluſion, as we conceive, doth eaſily and naturally follow, That as notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all that is ſaid, there is no Catholick viſible Body of mankinde, to which, or to the Officers wherof is given the power and priviledges of Civill government to rule this Catholick Body, either as one <hi>totum politicum</hi>; or the parts of it, Families, Cities, Kingdoms <hi>in communi,</hi> by ſubordination of all Societies with reference to the whole; or ſo as every King, Major, &amp;c. ſhould be an Officer of the whole. So theſe, and like conſequences will not follow in reſpect of the guides, government, priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, &amp;c. of the Catholick Church, notwithſtanding all that is ſaid from theſe conſiderations of unity, viſibility, priority of nature, &amp;c.</p>

               <hi>If any object, as ſome doe, in anſwer to an argument ſomewhat like this, that this ſimilitude holds not, becauſe there is not that externall union of viſible communion in the Common-wealths of the world, as in the Church; if one ſay, God hath placed Kings, Dukes in the Common-wealths,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:60763:43"/>
as in one organicall Body who have one head, who giveth influence to ſo many organs of head, feet, &amp;c. as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of the Body the Church,</hi> 1 Cor. 12. <hi>then indeed all the Common-wealths of the world would make but one body.</hi>

            <p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
               </label> To the Scripture alledged we ſhall ſpeak after, here onely let us clear our parallel. And firſt take the ſimilitude as it is ſtated by us, and it will be clear. Firſt, compare the Catholick number of mankinde, with the Catholick Church, which is the number of called ones, and then there is as much externall union of viſible communion in one, as in the other. For, firſt, all mankinde may and ought to maintain Civill communion one with another, in all Offices of humanity, for the common good of the whole, as the members of the Catholick Church doe, or ought to doe; and common humanity, and the command of the Morall Law binds thereto, as well as Chriſtianity and rules of the Goſpel bind here.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if we compare Civill ſocieties, as Families, Cities, Common-wealths with inſtituted Churches, it is as poſſible, and as well the duty of all Common-wealths in the world, by prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of humanity, and the Morall Law in all mens hearts, to maintain externall union of leagues of friendſhip, and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in all Offices of Civill ſociety, as it is poſſible, and the duty of all Church ſocieties, by the principles of Chriſtianity, and rule of the Goſpel to maintain externall union of viſible communion in the duties of Church ſociety.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, (not to diſpute here whether there be ſuch an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall union of viſible communion amongſt all the viſible Churches, as parts of the Church Catholick) if the reaſon alledged be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to prove the ſame, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe there is one head in the Church, who giveth influence to ſo many organs of head, feet, eyes, &amp;c. in the Church.</p>
            <p>Then ſtill our parallel will hold; for as this Head is no other then Chriſt Jeſus in his ſpirituall Kingdom, the Church giving that influence named; ſo the ſame Lord that is King and Head over all, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.11. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.22. doth give influence to many organs in this Body of Mankinde, even to all Kings, Judges, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of Families.</p>
            <p>And Chriſt is the ſame in reſpect of all authority, power, gifts, adminiſtrations Civill, &amp;c. to this Kingdome of Men, as he is to the Kingdom of his Church of all power ſpiritual: And although
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:60763:44"/>
the Church be a Body of nearer relation to Chriſt, then the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of mankinde; yet in regard of a common relation between a Head and Body there is a ſimilitude, which is ſufficient in this caſe.</p>
            <p>There is one thing more we meet withall that here we ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move, <hi>viz.</hi> when it is objected that the Catholick viſible Church cannot be one, becauſe it cannot convent together in one Society; it is anſwered uſually, that ſuch comming together in one ſociety is not needfull, becauſe as a Kingdom may be one, though all parts of it never meet together, having the ſame King, Laws, &amp;c. And as an Army may be one, having the ſame Generall, the ſame Laws of Diſcipline, the ſame cauſe, &amp;c. though the ſeverall Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gades ſhould never be drawn up into one body: So the Catholick Church having the ſame King, Laws, Cauſe, Enemies, is but one though it never meet.</p>
            <p>To this we ſhall here Reply ſo far as it lyes in our way: 1 As all union is for communion, and all communion flows from union; ſo look of what nature the union is, ſuch, and no other is the communion; and look of what nature the communion ought to be, of like nature ought the union to be, elſe it will not reach the end. And therefore here as the myſticall ſpirituall uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Catholick Church to Chriſt the head by faith, and to one another by love, is ſufficient to afford ſpirituall communion with the ſame: So unto Politicall communion there muſt bee a Politicall union into one policy. And as the nature of Politicall communion is, ſuch muſt the nature of the union be, that it may reach the end.</p>
            <p>To apply this, a Politicall Church is inſtituted of Chriſt for communion in all the Worſhip and Ordinances of Chriſt inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted in the Goſpel, as the Miniſtery of the Word, the Seales and Diſcipline; now no Church as <hi>One</hi> can have communion with Chriſt and one another in theſe things, but it muſt have a Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall union ſuitable thereunto, that is, they muſt be one Society that can at leaſt meet to combine together.</p>
            <p>And therefore if all Churches make one Politicall Body, for Politicall communion, it muſt be ſuch an union as will reach that end, which cannot be imagined in ſuch a Catholick <hi>totum politicum</hi> as the Catholick Church. 'Tis true, diſtinct Churches (as diſtinct Kingdoms) may have communion in ſome politicall priviledges anſwerable to their union, conſiſting in a fraternall
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:60763:44"/>
relation one unto another, yet not make up one Body Politicall; of which we ſpeak.</p>
            <p>Secondly, to the ſimilitudes brought, we anſwer, This whole Kingdom or Army is properly and clearly one Politicall Body under one Politicall head the King or General, as ſtands by Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant as members of that one Policy; and thoſe who have right to chooſe their King or Generall, may and doe ſome time or other convene. Let the like be ſhewed in the Catholick Church, that all Politicall Churches are moulded up into one Politicall Body, either <hi>de jure,</hi> or <hi>de facto,</hi> or that it is poſſible (as the caſe ſtands) ſo to be, and then the ſimilitudes would be of ſome uſe.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, in a Kingdom or Army, ſuppoſe they never meet, yet there is ſuch politicall union as fully reaches the politicall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion for which end it was combined, <hi>viz.</hi> that they ſhould enjoy peace and juſtice in and by a juſt Government, or by the protection of the Army. But if ſuch a politicall Body were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined to have ſuch communion as a Church-communion is, then it would require conventing together, as elſwhere we ſhall more fully manifeſt: For our parts, we do not ſee that Chriſt hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained the whole Catholick church as <hi>One,</hi> to have politicall communion together, which is impoſſible.</p>
            <p>And therefore we ſee no need of ſuch a Politicall combination, but as he hath ordained a Brotherly communion of counſell and helpfulneſſe one to another, as need requires; ſo a ſpirituall rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and brotherly conſociation of Churches together is union ſufficient for ſuch a communion.</p>
            <p>And thus far we have endevored to take away all thoſe argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which are built upon the generall conſiderations of the unity, viſibility and priority of the Catholick church, which we leave to the conſideration and examination of the judicious.</p>
            <p>We ſhall now, (as the Lord ſhall helpe us) come to cleare the ſtate of this knotty controverſie, as we think it ought to be ſtated and carryed. <hi>Viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What is that form of a Politicall Church which Jeſus Chriſt in the Goſpel hath inſtituted and appointed as the ſubject of Church power of government, and adminiſtration of all the ordinances of the Goſpel for actuall communion with Chriſt, and one with another therein? And here give us leave before we enter into the queſtion it ſelf, to make a little further uſe of our former ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude for illuſtration; and then we will ſhew where the <hi>ne plus
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:60763:45"/>
ultra,</hi> as we conceive muſt ſtand. It hath been ſhewed in reſpect of the body of mankinde, that although much may be ſaid for the unity, viſibility, and priority thereof before any parts of it, yet no reaſon will inforce that it is the firſt ſubject of Civill pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, &amp;c. in reſpect of actuall adminiſtration, and immediate enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof, and ſo here in reſpect of the Church. We will now add but this one thing more, that notwithſtanding all ſuch rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, yet in execution for the good of the whole, the leaſt civill ſociety, yea, a family may be, and is the firſt ſubject of civill power, and priviledges of civill government; ſo the leaſt politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Church ſociety may be the firſt ſubject of theſe Keys of Church power in the exerciſe thereof, and of immediate commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in all viſible ordinances, and we think that there by Divine inſtitution it is ſeated, and the edification and perfection of the Catholick Church may beſt be attained thereby.</p>
            <p>Concerning Families, we ſee no footſteps in the propagation of mankinde from <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Noah,</hi> of any ſoveraign or univerſall government, further then in the firſt Fathers of mankinde, after whom as they increaſed, families went out, and combining made cities, and ſo Common-wealths by mutuall conſent, as in <hi>Gen.</hi> 10. and other Stories appear, except by the tyrannous uſurpations of ſome as <hi>Nimrod,</hi> the reſt were brought under; and this no doubt amongſt any free people is ſtill the moſt orderly, juſt and ſafe way of erecting all forms of civill government; Families to combine into Townes, Cities, Kingdomes, or Ariſtocraticall States. But here ſome will ſay; If ſo, that according to this ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude, a particular congregation may be the firſt Church that have the Keys of Church power, and Church communion; then as families ſhould combine into Towns and Cities, and they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to greater Common-wealths, for the good of all mankinde; ſo here theſe firſt Churches may not ſtand independently, but ought to combine into greater Bodies, till they come to be one whole Church; to this we ſay, this will not follow upon this evident reaſon, becauſe civill ſocieties and government thereof, is herein left to rules of humane prudence by the Lord and governor of the whole world; and therefore may admit various forms of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, various Laws and Conſtitutions, various priviledges, &amp;c. according as men ſhall conceive beſt for themſelves, ſo they be not againſt the common morall rules of equity, and the good of thoſe Societies: but here in the Kingdom of Chriſt as wee
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:60763:45"/>
muſt attend what kinde of Church he hath inſtituted, ſo we muſt cleave to ſuch rules, priviledges, and forms of government and adminiſtrations as he hath ordained, not preſuming to goe one ſtep beyond the ſame. And hence it is not in the power of any Church to alienate the power, rights, or priviledges Chriſt have ſet in the ſame, or to mould up any other politicall Churches then he hath appointed; and here we conceive ſtands immovably the <hi>ne plus ultra</hi> of this ſimilitude between the viſible Church, and the eſtate of mankinde in reference to power and government, &amp;c. All which things well weighed, to us ſeems to overthrow all ſuch intermediate forms of Churches, or the <hi>uſuall</hi> Churches, as Mr. <hi>Ball</hi> calls the ſame; as, Claſſicall, Provinciall, Dioceſan, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall, Patriarchicall, &amp;c. which we ſee not how according to the rule of Chriſt they can be conſtituted either <hi>deſcendendo,</hi> from the common nature of the Catholick Church; or <hi>aſcendendo</hi>; from the combination of particulars, except inſtitution can bee found for the ſame. We find indeed, that ſome endevor to build ſuch forms upon the foundation of Morall principles, and the Law of nature; as, <hi>That God hath given government to be over a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and that of many Societies, as well as perſons, that one Society may not ſuffer as well as one perſon; and that therefore muſt be given of the God of grace to a ſociety and multitude of little Churches power of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which we anſwer; 1 That there is no ſuch principle in nature that generally binds free Societies to ſubmit to one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon government; muſt many Kingdoms, &amp;c. by conſequence all kingdoms combine in government, leſt one kingdome bee hurt, <hi>i.</hi> muſt <hi>Moab, Ammon, Edom, Tyre, Sydon, Judea, &amp;c.</hi> being ſo contiguous in near vicinity to each other, combine in one go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment? 2 Is it not as ſuitable to morality and reaſon, in ſuch combinations, that they ſet up <hi>One</hi> to rule over them, when many grow ignorant, evill, or heady, to preſerve peace, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent wrong, as to ſet up many? 3 Did <hi>Abraham, Lot, Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedeck,</hi> and ſuch family Churches, walk againſt grounds of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality and nature, that did not ſo combine? We might add more, but forbear; but we could deſire our dear Brethren to be wary of ſcattering ſuch principles; for though in the matters of the Church, and Worſhip, and Government of Chriſt, grace doth not deſtroy nature, yet look as a particular Church conſtitution and government was never erected by the Law of nature; but
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:60763:46"/>
Divine inſtitution, ſo for the governing of many over one, why ſhould there not be the like inſtitution?</p>
            <p>But to come more near to the caſe it ſelf, we ſhall endeavour to clear two things:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That there is no Catholick politicall Church ſociety inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by Chriſt, to which the actuall adminiſtration and partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of Church government and communion in the inſtituted ordinances of Chriſt, is given as to the firſt ſubject thereof.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the true form of all Church ſocieties inſtituted by Chriſt, to which he hath given the actuall adminiſtration and immediate participation of Church government, and all other inſtituted ordinances, as the ſubject thereof, is onely Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall.</p>
            <p>Firſt, concerning the firſt, to make our diſcourſe more diſtinct and plain, we ſhall premiſe here, that we doe not here at all take in, or reſpect that queſtion about the power of the Keys, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be in the fraternity or guides, (we ſhall God willing have a fit place to ſpeak ſomething of it) but here (that we may not intermingle things) we look onely at the true ſubject, in which, and unto which the actuall and immediate diſpenſation and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of Church government and outward ordinances is given by the inſtitution of the Goſpel. And here we firſt reaſon thus, Such a Church ſociety as Chriſt inſtituted, the Apoſtles of Chriſt conſtituted and governed in: But the Apoſtles never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted ſuch a Catholick church ſociety, or governed it in ſuch a manner as is ſaid: <hi>Ergo.</hi> The Propoſition is evident, becauſe the Apoſtles were to do whatſoever Chriſt commanded in <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.20. and were ſufficiently furniſhed with power and wiſdome ſo to doe: Beſides, the Apoſtles having all power from Chriſt as hee received from the Father, <hi>John</hi> 20. and the whole number of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers being then at the feweſt, there was never ſince ſuch an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity or poſſibility to conſtitute ſuch a Church, if Chriſt Jeſus had inſtituted ſuch a thing. The aſſumption or ſecond part of the reaſon is proved thus, If the Apoſtles ever conſtituted and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred in ſuch a Church catholick, it was either that at <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> mentioned <hi>Acts</hi> 1, &amp; 2. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or that aſſembly that met, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. (for we meet with no other that can with any colour of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon bee ſuppoſed) But neither of theſe were ſuch a conſtituted Church; <hi>Ergo.</hi> 1 Concerning the Church named, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed on, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we freely grant it was a conſtituted Church,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:60763:46"/>
wherein the Apoſtles with Elders and Deacons afterward choſen did govern, for as it is called a Church, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.47. ſo likewiſe we ſee there were in it elections, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. &amp; 6 and adminiſtrations of inſtituted ordinances of worſhip, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.41, 42. admiſſion of members, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.41, 47. and by the ſame reaſon there might have been excommunication alſo: But that this Church was not the Catholick Church, we prove thus: If it were the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick church, then it was ſuch either in reſpect of the whole eſſence of the Catholick church, or in reſpect of repreſentation; but neither ways: <hi>Ergo.</hi> The firſt it could not be, becauſe it conſiſted at the firſt but of 120. which was a very ſmall part of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick number of viſible beleevers; for, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.6. there were above 500 Brethren to whom Chriſt appeared at once, which was but ſome few weeks before, beſides all that in the Jewiſh Church were converted and baptized by <hi>John,</hi> which were very many; yea, if we ſpeak of the Catholick church, properly all the Jewiſh Church, not yet diſſolved, were part of the Catholick church of that age viſible. Laſtly, if it had been the Catholick church, beleevers being already of it, could not be ſaid to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to this; as, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.13, 14. Secondly, it was not Catholick in reſpect of repreſentation, for if ſo, then in reſpect of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles onely as the Catholick guides, or in reſpect of the whole aſſembly with them, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. not the firſt, for then the Apoſtles onely ſhould have had power to ſet apart <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>thias,</hi> but it is evident that that election was by <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf committed to, and acted by the whole company called the Brethren and Diſciples, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.15, 16, 26. where it appears that as he ſpake to all, ſo it was concluded with the common ſuffrages of all.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if ſo, becauſe the Apoſtles were Catholick guides, then where-ever they met was a Catholick church, yea, where two or three, or any one of them was, there was the Catholick repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative church, and ſo many ſuch churches, for any two or one had the catholick power as well as all; <hi>Paul</hi> ordains, rules, and orders of diſcipline in all the churches, as well as if all the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles had met, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.17. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.1. 2 <hi>That aſſembly</hi> was not the repreſentative catholick church, becauſe, firſt, there were the women in the ſame, now women are no way capable of being meſſengers to repreſent churches: ſecondly, beſides, theſe could not be repreſentative meſſengers from other churches, becauſe this was the firſt conſtituted church; we ſee no colour of reaſon
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:60763:47"/>
that there were any other conſtituted viſible churches before this. Laſtly, all the actions of that Church mentioned, eſpecially thoſe in <hi>Acts</hi> 2.41, 42. of admiſſion of members, baptiſm, word, ſeales, fellowſhip day by day in ſuch ordinances, choice of Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, &amp;c. ſpeak aloud againſt a repreſentative Church, we ſhould rather have heard of conſtitutions, cenſures, &amp;c. from ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative Catholick church of generall counſell.</p>

               </label> True, the Apoſtles and others were of <hi>Galilee,</hi> but they had forſaken all to follow Chriſt, and were commanded by Chriſt to remain a time at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and then to goe forth to <hi>Samaria, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea,</hi> and the utmoſt parts of the earth, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.4, 8. and therfore no Church relation in <hi>Galilee</hi> could hinder them from joyning in this firſt conſtituted Church, or give any colour that they came as members repreſentative from any Churches in <hi>Galilee.</hi> And ſo much for the plea for a Catholick church from <hi>Acts</hi> 1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now concerning that which is ſuppoſed of a Catholick church repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative in <hi>Act.</hi> 15.

            </p>
            <p n="1">1 Not the firſt, for then as was ſaid, any one Apoſtle may make a repreſentative Catholick church, having the whole power, as much as all of them together; for though they would meet oft to conſult and aſſiſt one another; yet not for defect of power in any one; and we think our brethren here will not ſay it was in reſpect of the Apoſtles alone, ſuppoſing here they acted rather
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:60763:47"/>
as Elders with the reſt, then out of their Apoſtolicall power.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Not in reſpect of the whole Aſſembly, for then that aſſembly muſt conſiſt of the meſſengers of all the particular Churches, and the decrees ſhould have been directed to all the Churches; but neither of theſe can appear; For, firſt, wee read of no other meſſengers but thoſe from <hi>Antioch,</hi> and how to evince more then the Scriptures reveal, is hard. Secondly, if we look back and conſider how far the Goſpel was ſpread before this aſſembly, it will appear very ſtrange and abſurd to ſuppoſe ſuch a thing; for <hi>Paul</hi> had been in <hi>Arabia</hi> before ever he came to <hi>Ieruſalem, Gal.</hi> 1.17. and when he and <hi>Barnabas</hi> went ſent out from <hi>Antioch, Acts</hi> 13. they went to ſeverall Iſlands and Countreys, as <hi>Cyprus, Paphos, Salamis, &amp;c.</hi> beſides what other places ſcattered Chriſtians and Apoſtles had preached in: now there is no probability of meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers ſent from all theſe places.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the decrees were expreſly directed to the Gentiles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving, in <hi>Antioch, Syria,</hi> and <hi>Cilicia,</hi> where it ſeems this queſtion had troubled the minds of the Diſciples, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.23, 24. which was far ſhort of the Catholick church; neither is it proved that the Churches of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Cilicia</hi> had any meſſengers there, much leſſe that all the Churches had their meſſengers.</p>

               <hi>Brightman</hi> (none of the meaneſt in this kinde of Scriptures) applyes this place to the church of <hi>Geneva,</hi> and the times of purer Churches to ariſe after it, which are ſaid to be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible as an Army with Banners; not in reſpect of Diſcipline, but in reſpect of warlike power, whereby that ſtate of the church ſhall defend it ſelf.</p>
            <p n="2">2 But ſuppoſe that it is a deſcription of the catholick church viſible, yet it cannot be a ſufficient argument that it is one Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteriall church: For, firſt, the catholick church is the ſame in all ages, and therefore by this reaſon it was a catholick Miniſteriall body, as well in the days from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Abraham, &amp;c.</hi> as in the New Teſtament. Secondly, by this argument we may prove Chriſt
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:60763:49"/>
the head and husband of the church to be an organicall body, as he is the Head of the Church, for <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.10, 11. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Church doth allegorically deſcribe the beauty and excellency of Chriſt, in ſeverall organs and parts: but we ſuppoſe though Chriſt Jeſus in his humane nature hath members, yet the ſcope of the Church is not at all to ſet forth the members of his humane body, but the glorious excellencies, and ſpirituall perfections of Chriſt as the Redeemer and Saviour of his Church, according to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Lovers, who are taken with the beauty of their ſpouſes in all their members; When the ſpouſe ſaith, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.1. <hi>Let him kiſſe me with the kiſſes of his mouth</hi>; it were too groſſe to apply it to the humanity of Chriſt, or to argue from thence that Chriſt the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band of his Church is an organicall body.</p>
            <p>Thirdly and laſtly, when the Church is called <hi>One, the onely one of her Mother</hi>; though it's true ſhe is one, it ſeems rather to ſet out her excellency as rare, and but one, then her unity: and ſo the other deſcriptions all tend to ſet forth her beauty in the eye and eſteem of Chriſt; neither is it any thing that the Church is compared to an Army terrible with banners, for in the ſame <hi>Chap.</hi> verſ. the laſt, ſhe is compared to the company of <hi>Mahanaim,</hi> or two Armies, (which is all one) for the company of <hi>Mahanaim</hi> conſiſted of two Armies, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.1, 2, 3. where <hi>Jacobs</hi> hoſt meeting an hoſt of Angels, he calls the place <hi>Mahanaim,</hi> or, two Hoſts; and therefore we may as well ſay the Catholick church is terrible, with two Armies of Banners, as one.</p>

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:60763:50"/>
others not ſo gifted; hence he puts them in minde; 1 What once they were following dumb idols. 2 That all gifts are from the free diſpenſation of God, and that one God, one Lord, one Spirit. 3 That God in his wiſdom hath diſpenſed great variety of gifts, operations and adminiſtrations. 4 That all are given to profit withal, and theſe things he illuſtrates by a ſimile taken from a naturall body, which having largely preſented and applyed to this Church, <hi>verſ.</hi> 27. he concludes with the variety of admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations in ſuch things wherein they ſo much differed, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.12, 13. God hath ſet, ſaith he, in the Church not onely Apoſtles, or Prophets, or tongues, &amp;c. but all theſe; are all Apoſtles? are all Prophets, &amp;c? no, but the wiſdom of God hath given you variety of theſe gifts and adminiſtrations; and therefore, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. to quiet them, he ſaith, <hi>Paul an Apoſtle, Apollos an Evangeliſt, &amp;c. all are yours</hi>; and as this is the ſcope of the Apoſtle, ſo we ſee nothing in the Chapter but is appliable to <hi>Corinth</hi> in particular, yea, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed unto them by the Apoſtle, as what he ſpake <hi>verſ.</hi> 22. of one body, he applyes to them, <hi>verſ.</hi> 27. what he ſpake, <hi>verſ.</hi> 28. of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and other gifts ſet in the Church, he applyes alſo to them, <hi>Chap.</hi> 14. whereas he ſpeaks of the exerciſe of divers gifts in that Church, when the whole Church came together, <hi>verſ.</hi> 23, ſo he ſpeaks the ſame of himſelf an Apoſtle, <hi>verſ.</hi> 6. <hi>When I come, &amp;c.</hi> We take notice of divers reaſons alledged from the <hi>Chapter,</hi> that he ſpake of the Catholick church, but they doe not inforce it; for grant ſuch things are true of the Catholick church in a ſenſe, <hi>viz.</hi> that in it God works all in all, in it are diverſities of gifts, &amp;c. yet the Apoſtles ſcope is to ſpeak to this Church, as hath been ſhewed, and all are truly applyable unto it, this Church came be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde in no good gift, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.7. this Church was one body, <hi>verſ.</hi> 27. and baptized into one body, whether Jews or Gentiles, bond or free, the members of this Church needed the helpe one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, muſt not make ſchiſmes in the Body, muſt care one for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp;c. yea, Apoſtles as well as other gifts were in the church, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.1. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.6.

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:60763:51"/>
whole kinde of reaſonable man may be made up, and the end attained, and ſo it is here: God in giving Officers and gifts for the good of the myſticall body of Chriſt firſtly, yet in execution gives theſe Officers, and ſets them in particular Churches, that by the edification and perfection of all particulars, the whole may be attained.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Apoſtles, Prophets, and all gifts and offices in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and indefinitely, are given to the Church indefinitely conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, but particular officers, <hi>Paul, Cephas, Apollo, Titus, Arabip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus, &amp;c.</hi> are given or ſet in particular Churches; we mean, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſeverall natures and extents of their offices; As unto Bees in generall ingi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </gap> a power to gather honey, and order themſelves in their hives; but in their exerciſe of this power it is given to the ſeverall ſwarms in the hives, who have their Queens, &amp;c. to order themſelves. But as this power in generall makes not a univerſall organicall body of Bees; no more here an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall organicall Church.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, to ſpeak more particularly, we conceive that the place in the utmoſt latitude of it is meant of the myſticall body, that one body into which all are baptized; <hi>verſ.</hi> 13. And that the fundamentall miſtake of our Brethren is this, that becauſe the Church here mentioned hath Organs and politicall Officers in it, that therefore it muſt needs make one politicall Church, where ſome Organs are to rule in common, and every part is to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the whole. For although the myſticall Church hath Organs and politicall Officers in it; yet it follows not therefore that it is one politicall body. For the inviſible Church conjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the viſible, hath politicall Officers ſet in it, and given to it as inviſible, as well as viſible, in reſpect of Gods generall deſignation and particular application of them to this whole Church; yet it follows not that they are one politicall body by actuall combination thereunto; actuall combination, we ſay, for although Chriſts inſtitution muſt warrant and preſcribe all forms of politicall bodies, yet it will not be found that ever there was any politicall Society without actuall combination, whether civill or ſacred, whether nationall or more particular. The myſticall Church may be ſaid to be organicall in reſpect of the Officers amongſt them in the ſeverall parts thereof; every part being a part of the whole ſpiritually, though not politically. But it doth not thence follow that the whole is one politicall
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:60763:51"/>
body, but myſticall. Politicall Officers may, and muſt ſuppoſe ſome part of the Church to be viſible, but not that the whole ſhould be Politicall. For the Apoſtles (by extraordinary Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion for their time were officers of viſible beleevers, fit matter for a combination, as well as of particular combinations: yet it follows not that viſible beleevers exiſting out of combinations were a politicall Society that would never meet to combine; but they were onely a viſible number of Saints.</p>
            <p>We have been thus large in clearing this Scripture, becauſe we conceive the chief ſtrength of the contrary opinion to lye in it. And this being anſwered, the light of it we hope will ſcatter the darkneſſe that is brought upon divers other Scriptures which are drawn to prove ſuch a kinde of Catholick Church, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.4. &amp;c. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.25. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>To ſay it is naturall, were too abſurd; it voluntary, then nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Congregations, Claſſes, Provinces, Nations, have power to excommunicate without the previous conſent of the whole Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick church, which muſt voluntarily concurr thereunto.

               </label> 1 It is true, the notion of a flock of redeemed ones of the Body, and Spouſe of Chriſt, Kingdom, Houſe, &amp;c. doe agree primarily to the Church, not of this, but of all ages, and ſecondarily to the Church of this age, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1.18. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.25, 26. and 2.19.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The Church which is the Body of Chriſt exiſting in this age, the Keys are given to it primarily, in compariſon of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Churches <hi>coexiſting</hi> with it, as to the chief object and end; but not to it as a politicall Body, in reſpect of actuall and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate diſpenſation thereof: for (as we have oft ſaid) if in reſpect of Politicall diſpenſation the Keys belong firſtly to the Body of Chriſt as his Spouſe and redeemed ones; then the Church inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as inviſible, rather then viſible, muſt have the diſpenſation of the Keys primarily.</p>
            <p n="3">3 It is not ſaid, that the Keys are immediately given to a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church abſtractly, as a number of redeemed, but as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociated and politically combined: And in this reſpect that may be attributed to the part, a particular Congregation of redeemed ones, which cannot be attributed to the whole. <hi>Ex. gr.</hi> ſuch a Congregation is combined, ſo is not the whole, nor can be; ſuch a Church may chooſe a Paſtor over it, but ſo cannot the whole; ſo a man may tell the particular Church, who may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene together, not ſo the whole.</p>
            <p>Thus far (through the helpe of Chriſt) we have endevoured to clear the firſt Point propounded concerning a Catholick inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted Church. We come now to prove the ſecond Point, <hi>viz.</hi> That Jeſus Chriſt hath inſtituted in the Goſpel a particular Church
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:60763:55"/>
of one Congregation, in which, and unto which the actuall and immediate diſpenſation and participation of all inſtituted Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip doe regularly and ordinarily belong.</p>
            <p>And here we ſhall ſhew: 1 What ſuch a particular Church is. 2 How the diſpenſation of Church power and priviledge do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto it. For the firſt, we ſhall declare our ſelves in theſe Five Propoſitions.</p>
            <p n="1">1 It muſt be a viſible Society, for <hi>One</hi> man cannot make a Church, nor can many viſible beleevers living ſeverally, without ſociety in ſeverall Nations make <hi>One</hi> Church.</p>
            <p n="2">2 It's not every Society of viſible Profeſſors that doe make a Church, for then every family of ſuch Profeſſors are a Church: Then two or three (which our Brethren ſo much condemn) are a Church; and then a Society of Women profeſſing the truth may be a Politicall Church; then many members of ſeverall Churches met to hear a Sermon, or any like occaſion, make a Church; then a number of Profeſſors may conſtitute a Dioceſan Church, or any like form; for out of this block, That any number of beleevers made a Church, Dr. <hi>Downam</hi> hewed out his Dioceſan Church, and ſo made a fit ſeat for his Dioceſan Mercury. Laſtly, then particular Churches ſhould have no more any ſet Form pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, then Civill government, which is as variable as humane wiſdome ſees meet, for hence a particular Church may be melted into any form or mould of civil Society; for imagine a number of profeſſing beleevers, cohabiting either in a City, Hundred, Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentake, Shire, Province, Nation, Empire, &amp;c. there ſhall then be ſo many forms of Churches contrary to the principles and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwerable arguments of our beſt Reformers, who accounted it a great abſurdity that the heavenly Kingdome of Chriſt ſhould be moulded and framed according to the weakneſſe of humane wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and policy.</p>
            <p n="3">3 It muſt therefore be a Society combined, and that by a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant explicite or implicite, for it muſt be ſuch a combined So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety where the whole have power over its members; now what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever power one hath over another, if it be not by way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt or naturall relation, (as the father over the childe) it is by covenant, as husband and wife, Maſter and ſervant, Prince and people; other powers are but uſurpations: it is noted as a prophane ſpeech in <hi>Bronnus,</hi> who profeſſed he knew no other rule of Juſtice, then for the greater to ſubdue the leſſe. Again, it is
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:60763:55"/>
ſuch a Society as hath an ordinate power, to ſubject it ſelf to Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, by electing of them to adminiſter ordinances amongſt them; but this is onely a federall Society.</p>
            <p>Again, it is ſuch a Society, to the making up of which is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſomething more then faith, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.14. <hi>Beleevers were added to the Lord,</hi> or to his Church; ſo that they were firſt beleevers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were added to the Church; for there may be a number of beleevers converted at one Sermon, and immediately ſcattered into many Towns or Countreys: Now, if faith profeſſed alone, makes not a Church, but ſomewhat more is required, what can that be but foederall combination?</p>
            <p>Laſtly, that, the diſſolution whereof doth unchurch a people, doth conſtitute a Church: but breaking the combination diſſolves the Church, whether by conſent, ſchiſm, or when God himſelf removes the candleſtick: <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4 Though a Church be ſuch by combining, and ſo ſubjecting themſelves to the power of others, yet it muſt not be herein illimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but according to the form and mould expreſſed in the Word; for if they have this power to combine as many, and as largely as they will, then a Dioceſe, Province, Nation, may combine, and ſo put themſelves under the power of a Dioceſan, Provinciall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Nationall ſociety, which is unlawfull; for the Church muſt be ſuch a form as a man may ordinarily bring offences unto it, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. <hi>Tell the Church</hi>; but that cannot be in a Dioceſe, much leſſe in a Province or Nation, where the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers can neither take notice of the offence, nor ordinarily ſo much as conſent unto any cenſure acted by any Officers in ſuch a Church; nay, further, if their power be unlimited, they may chooſe a Dioceſan Paſtor, one, or many to feed all, or one to rule (like <hi>Beza</hi> his <hi>Epiſcopus humanus</hi>) with ſubjection in caſe of error to the cenſure of all; nay, hence we ſee not, but they may chooſe an univerſall Paſtor, and ſo give away the power to one, if all will agree.</p>
            <p>In a word, they onely may combine into a Politicall Body, where the whole may excommunicate any part; but this cannot be in a combination of many Churches into one whole, becauſe no particular Church is capable of excommunication, for it is impoſſible to be caſt out of it ſelf, as was ſaid before.</p>
            <p n="5">5 A particular Church therefore muſt be ſuch a Society as is ſo combined together, that it may ordinarily enjoy Church com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:60763:56"/>
to exerciſe Church power, to be fed by her Officers, and led by them; hence <hi>Titus</hi> was to ſet Elders in every Church, and theſe Elders were ſuch as could ordinarily feed them, by preaching the Word, as well as rule and govern them.</p>
            <p>Now that ſuch a Congregationall Church is the inſtitution of the Goſpel, appears firſt by thoſe many Scriptures that ſpeak of the Churches of one Countrey, and in ſmall compaſſe, as ſeverall Churches, not as one, as the Churches of <hi>Judea, Samaria,</hi> and <hi>Galilee, Acts</hi> 9. the Churches of <hi>Galatia, Gal.</hi> 1.1. yea, not only in one ſmall Countrey, but in Cities, or near unto them; we read of diſtinct Churches, as <hi>Corinth,</hi> though God had much peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there, yet it was one Congregation, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.33. and had another Church near to it, <hi>viz. Cenchrea</hi>: Alſo <hi>Rome,</hi> whom the Apoſtle ſaluting, ſends alſo ſalutations by them to <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priſcilla,</hi> with the Church in their houſhold, which ſhew they were not far from that Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> To theſe add, that <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> the firſt Church that was conſtituted by the Apoſtles, and whoſe number was the greateſt of any that we read of, yet it was but one Congregation, as is evident by <hi>Acts</hi> 1. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.41, 42. What is objected againſt this to prove it the Catholick Church, was anſwered before; other objections againſt this, and like exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, ſhall be conſidered in their due place, as we meet with them.</p>
            <p>But we ſhall not need to ſay much, that a Congregation fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with its Officers is a Church according to the inſtitution of the Goſpel, but there are more objections againſt the compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe thereof, which yet is proved thus, That Church which hath power of all the Keys given unto it for actuall adminiſtration within it ſelf, is a compleat Church: But ſo hath a particular Congregation, <hi>Ergo.</hi> The firſt part is evident; becauſe where all the Keys are with full power to adminiſter the ſame, there nothing is wanting; the Aſſumption is proved thus, If all thoſe Officers to whom is given the authoritative power of exerciſing the Keys, be given to a Congregation; then all the Keys are ſo given to it, but ſo it is; for ſince Apoſtles and extraordinary Officers ceaſed, there are no other Officers but Paſtors, Teachers, and Rulers, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſometimes Biſhops, ſometimes Elders: but theſe Officers are given to ſuch a Church, as is proved <hi>Acts</hi> 14. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.4. and is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged in all Reformed Churches, who ordain ſuch Officers in particular Churches of one Congregation: <hi>Ergo.</hi>

As <hi>Abraham</hi> having a compleat go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in his family was not bound to combine with the governments he came amongſt, neither did he; in prudence he joyned in a league of amity and for mutual help with <hi>Aner, &amp;c.</hi> but not to ſubmit to their government: ſo here a Church having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Officers is not bound to ſubmit to ſuch combinations, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be proved that any ſuperior power of other churches can command the ſame.</p>
            <p>Secondly, though a family not having compleat civill govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:60763:57"/>
in it ſelf muſt combine where it ſtands in a commonwealth, yet never to yeeld up its family-government over wife, children and ſervants to rule them in common with other Maſters of fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, no civill prudence or morall rule taught men ever ſo to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe; and therefore why in ſuch a caſe ſhould a Church give up the government of it ſelf to Paſtors of many Churches to rule it in common, and not rather as a Claſſis is over-awed by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinciall onely in common things; ſo in congregations Paſtors ſhould govern their flocks, and onely in things common be under a Presbytery. If it be ſaid, <hi>That the Claſſis do act in ſuch things only; for in excommunication of an offender, the offence is common to all.</hi> We anſwer, if ſo, then why ſhould not the Provinciall and Nationall Churches by this reaſon aſſume all to themſelves from the Claſſis? for the offence of one is common to all: As alſo upon this ground, why ſhould not the Claſſis admit all the members of every Congregation under them? for this alſo may concern them all.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, here is a great difference, for civill Societies are left to civill prudence; and may give up themſelves to many forms of government: but Churches are bound to uſe and maintain ſuch order of government as Chriſt hath ſet in the church, and not to give it up to many, no more then to one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If teſtimonies were needfull, we might produce <hi>Zanchi, Zwinglius, Parker, Baines,</hi> and others, who are fully with us in this doctrine of a particular church; yea, Dr. <hi>Downam</hi> himſelf confeſſeth; that the moſt of the churches in the time of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> did not exceed the proportion of a populous congregation; and this confeſſion puts us in minde of a witty paſſage of his Refuter, or his Epiſtoler, who againſt the Biſhops maintains the doctrine of congregatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall churches with us; with whoſe expreſſions, (for the recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our ſelves and the Reader) we will conclude: <hi>The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>he tels us (juſt as the Organs goe at</hi> Rome) <hi>that the extent of a Biſhops juriſdiction is not limited but by the Popes appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, his power of it ſelf indifferently reaching over all the world. Our Prelatiſts would perſwade us (to the tune of Canterbury) that neither church nor Biſhop hath his bounds determined by the Pope, nor yet by Chriſt in the Scriptures, but left to the pleaſure of Princes, to be caſt into one mould with the Civill State. Now the plain Chriſtian finding nothing but humane uncertainties in either of theſe deviſes, he contenteth himſelf with plain ſong, and knowing that Christ hath appointed Chriſtians to
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:60763:57"/>
gather themſelves into ſuch Societies as may aſſemble themſelves together for the worſhip of God, and that unto ſuch he hath given their peculiar Paſtors; he, I ſay, in his ſimplicity calleth theſe Aſſemblies, the Churches of Chriſt, and theſe Paſtors, his Biſhops.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus much concerning the nature of a particular church, and that it is inſtituted in the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>Now in the ſecond place wee are to ſhew how church go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Ordinances are given to it as to the proper ſubject of the ſame. Where we ſhall propound theſe <hi>Theſes</hi> for explication of our ſelves.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Though Paſtourſhip conſidered as an office in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to a people to feed them authoritatively, be one of theſe Ordinances given to a particular church: Yet Chriſt hath given it for the gathering in of his elect unto the church, and therfore wee grant ſome acts of the Miniſtery, <hi>viz.</hi> the preaching of the Word, is to be extended beyond the bounds of the church.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Seales and other Priviledges although <hi>de jure,</hi> and remotely they belong to the catholique church, or the number of beleevers: yet <hi>de facto</hi> and nextly they belong properly to this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject which wee ſpeake of, (as wee hope to make good.)</p>
            <p>Thirdly, They are not ſo appropriated to ſuch congregations onely as to exclude the members of thoſe congregations which are under the government of a common Presbytery or other formes of government, for wee have a brotherly eſteeme of ſuch congregations, notwithſtanding that <hi>tertium quoddam ſeparabile</hi> of government, (as Mr. <hi>Baines</hi> cals it) being a thing that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to a church now conſtituted, and may be abſent, the church remaining a Church.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, although it be ſaid by ſome Divines, that as faith is the internall form of the church, ſo profeſſion of faith is the outward form, and that therefore bare profeſſion of faith makes a member of the viſible church, yet this muſt be underſtood accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the interpretations of ſome of them who ſo ſpeak, for there is a double profeſſion of faith; Perſonall, which is acted ſeverally by particular perſons; and common, which is acted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jointly in, and with a Society: The firſt makes a man of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick number of viſible Saints, and ſo fit matter for politicall church-ſociety: the other makes a man of the politicall church formally and compleatly; and in this latter ſenſe profeſſion of faith is the externall form of a viſible church, but not in the other.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:60763:58"/>Now that in and to this ſubject ſo profeſſing, the ſeals and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ordinances belong may, be proved thus:</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Argument. </seg>1</label> Firſt, the ſeals and other Church-ordinances muſt either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Catholick church as ſuch, or to the particular Church: but theſe cannot belong to the Catholick in actuall diſpenſation whereof we now ſpeak: <hi>Ergo.</hi> For that Church which is uncapable of actuall diſpenſation of ſeales, cenſures, &amp;c. is uncapable of the participation thereof in an orderly and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary way; But the Catholick number of viſible beleevers as Catholick, and out of particular Societies, are not capable of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſing the ſame; <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Propoſition is evident, for it cannot be ſhewed that any Church in the New Teſtament was ever capable of participating in ſeals, that was not capable of diſpenſing them, at leaſt not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a next power to elect Officers to do it.</p>
            <p>The Aſſumption is evident from what hath been proved, that it is no politicall Body (the ſole ſubject of Church adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) neither in the whole, nor in the parts as exiſting out of Congregations.</p>

               <hi>That Baptiſm is a ſolemn ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion into the Church of Chriſt, and muſt of neceſſity be adminiſtred in a particular Society</hi>: Whence three things will follow; Firſt, that Baptiſm ſometimes adminiſtred privately by the Apoſtles is not an ordinary pattern. Secondly, that Baptiſm is not to be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred to beleevers (as ſuch) immediatly, if of neceſſity it muſt be adminiſtred in a particular Society. Thirdly, joyning to ſome particular Society being an Ordinance of God of ſo great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment; &amp; if Baptiſm muſt be adminiſtred in it, why ought not, why may not ſuch joyn to that Society? (at leaſt as members for a time.) Alſo when he ſaith divers times, <hi>That men are made mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church by Baptiſm,</hi> (ſpeaking of ſuch Churches as chooſe <hi>Officers</hi> over them;) <hi>yea, that the Apoſtles conſtituted Chrches by Baptiſm,</hi> and the like, (which we ſhall note in the anſwer;) Now what doe theſe argue but a yeelding of the cauſe? for if the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles made members, and conſtituted Churches by Baptiſm, this was onely ſacramentally, and if ſo, then of neceſſity they muſt be really members of ſuch Churches before Baptiſm.</p>
            <p>Thus we have run through this large field of the Catholick and particular Church, which hath detained us longer then we inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; yet, to prevent miſtakes from any thing that have been ſaid concerning the union, communion, and combination of the Churches; we ſhall add theſe two things.</p>
            <p n="1">1 We obſerve that the Scripture ſpeaks of the Church, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times as <hi>One</hi> body, ſometimes as many, and therefore called Churches; and hence our care is to preſerve not onely the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of Churches, (as many by particular combinations) but alſo their unity, as being one by ſpirituall relation.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Aſſociation of divers particular Churches we hold needfull, as well as the combination of members into one; yet ſo as there be no ſchiſm of one from another, nor uſurpation of one over another, that either one ſhould deprive the reſt of peace by ſchiſm;
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:60763:59"/>
or many ſhould deprive any one of its power by uſurpation; hence a fraternall conſociation we acknowledge; conſociation we ſay, for mutuall counſell and helpe, to prevent or remove ſinne and ſchiſm; yet fraternall onely, to preſerve each others power; conſociation of Churches we would have cumulative, (not in words, but in deed) to ſtrengthen the power of particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, not privative, to take away any power which they had from the gift of Chriſt before.</p>
            <p>For as on the one ſide it may ſeem ſtrange that <hi>One</hi> Church offending ſhould have no means of cure by the conceived power of many; ſo on the other ſide the danger may appear as great, and frequently falls out, that when many Churches are ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, one innocent Church may be hurt by the uſurpation of all. And hence we ſee not, but that fraternall conſociation is the beſt medicine to heal the wounds of both.</p>
            <p>We utterly diſlike ſuch Independency as that which is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by contempt, or careleſſe neglect of ſiſter Churches; <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciunt favos &amp; veſpae,</hi>

               </label> Before we come to the particulars of the Reply, it is needfull to clear our meaning from this miſtake about the word [<hi>ordinary diſpenſation</hi>;] which being rightly underſtood, it will appear that
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:60763:59"/>
it no way cuts the ſinews of the conſideration as is objected. For whereas, firſt, you extend the oppoſite term, [<hi>extraordinary diſpenſation</hi>] to the whole generall practice of the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts; and ſecondly, take it for granted, that their practice was not to baptize members of particular Churches<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we neither intended the firſt, nor doe we grant the ſecond; as for the firſt, we acknowledge freely that the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts ordinarily and generally practiced according to comon rules in this point of baptizing, as well as in other, and left their practice for our pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern, and therefore their ordinary practice in this thing we ſhall ſtick to; yet they having not onely extraordinary power above Paſtors and Teachers, but alſo having ſometime an immediate call unto ſome acts and ſpeciall guidance of the Spirit to warrant what they did, therefore there were ſome of their actions, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in reſpect of ſome circumſtances thereof, which ordinary Paſtors (not ſo aſſiſted) may not doe; as in this caſe when they baptized in private houſes, in the wilderneſſe alone, and not in the face of a Congregation, &amp;c. and therefore if in ſome few caſes ſome doe think they did not baptize into a particular Church; yet if their ordinary practice were otherwiſe, we ought to imitate the ordinary, not ſome extraordinary caſes; and thus the ſinews and force of the conſideration remains ſtrong, notwithſtanding this word of [<hi>ordinary diſpenſation:</hi>] and that this was our mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, was not hard to diſcern, by the Scriptures cited in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, to prove the ſeales are given unto the Church in ordinary diſpenſation, amongſt which, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.41, 42, 47. containing the Apoſtles firſt practice in this kinde are expreſſed; and Mr. <hi>Ball</hi> took notice thereof, as appears by his own reference to the ſame afterwards, though in his printed Reply thoſe quotations bee wholly left out.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Let us conſider whether the Apoſtles ordinarily did not bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize into particular Churches; and this may be proved from the ſtories of their ordinary practice: Firſt, it will be eaſily granted that the Apoſtles did gather diſciples into particular viſible Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, but there is no other time or ſeaſon of doing it can be ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all the ſtories of their Acts; yea, ſometimes they were ſo ſuddenly called away, or enforced away by perſecution after they had converted diſciples, that it is very improbable, if not impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, they ſhould do it at all, but when they converted and baptized them, as <hi>Acts</hi> 16.40. &amp; 17.5. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:60763:60"/>But to come more particularly unto the ſtory it ſelf, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles firſt, and exemplary practiſe being the beſt interpreter of their commiſſion, and of their ordinary proceeding therein; the firſt converts which the Apoſtles baptized after the viſible kingdom of Chriſt was ſet up, were thoſe in that famous place, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.41. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning whom obſerve, firſt, that the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> not onely prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched unto them repentance and faith in the name of Chriſt, with promiſe of remiſſion of ſins<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that they ſhould be baptized, but according to that commiſſion, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. with many other words he exhorted them, ſaying, <hi>Save your ſelves from this untoward gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> being the very ſcope of his exhortation; and this implies a gathering of themſelves to the fellowſhip of the ſaints; and al this Word they gladly received before they were baptized.</p>
            <p n="2">2 When the holy Ghoſt, verſ. 41. declareth their baptizing, he records withall their adding to them, the latter being an exegeſis of the former, and that the ſame day, as being performed at the ſame time; and indeed when a convert publickly profeſſeth his faith in Chriſt, is it not as eaſily done<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>eive him to a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular viſible Church, as into the Catholick before Baptiſm; but firſt to baptize them, and then the ſame day to add or joyn them to the Church, is altogether unprobable. And that this adding was to a particular Church, is ſufficiently proved before.</p>
            <p>The next place you may note, is <hi>Acts</hi> 5.14. where the Holy Ghoſt omitting the baptizing of thoſe beleevers, yet ſpeaks of their adding to the Lord, as if the one implyed the other; and that their adding to the Lord, was by their joyning to the Church, is evident by the oppoſition between verſe 13 &amp; 14. Of the reſt durſt no man joyn himſelf to them, but beleevers were the more added to the Lord.</p>
            <p n="3">3 In the converſion of <hi>Samaria,</hi> although ſo great a work is declared in ſo few words in one verſe, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.12. yet the text puts a manifeſt diſtinction of <hi>Philips</hi> doctrine between the things of the Kingdom of God, and the name of Jeſus Chriſt: which plainly enough ſheweth, that they taught the obſerving of the order of the Kingdom of Chriſt, as well as the Doctrine of the name of Chriſt, the object of ſaving faith. And this they received by faith, and profeſſed before they were baptized.</p>
            <p>Now the firſt and moſt famous examples of the Apoſtles per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading that ſo they practiſed, why ſhould we doubt of their like practice in other examples when nothing is ſaid that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicteth
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:60763:60"/>
the ſame? as <hi>Acts</hi> 10. in the baptizing of <hi>Cornelius</hi> his houſe, where ſo many were met, and the Holy Ghoſt fell on all; why ſhould we think the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> baptized them, and left them out of the order of Chriſt, wherein they ſhould worſhip him, and be edified in the faith? If we doubt of it, becauſe the Scripture is ſilent therein, we may as well queſtion whether thoſe beleevers, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.4. &amp; 9.35. &amp; verſ. 42. whether any of theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed their faith, or were baptized, for nothing is ſaid thereof: So likewiſe <hi>Acts</hi> 11. where we read of many beleeving, turning to the Lord, verſ. 21. of the adding others to the Lord, verſ. 24. but nothing of their confeſſion of faith or baptiſm, and yet they are called a Church; whereby it appears that the holy Ghoſt ſometime expreſſeth their baptiſm without joyning to the Church; and ſometimes joyning without baptiſm, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time he expreſſeth both, <hi>Acts.</hi> 2.41. And therefore hence we may conclude the like of the caſe of <hi>Lydia</hi> and the Jaylor; conſidering the former practice of the Apoſtles: and that the Apoſtle ſpeaks ſo expreſly of a Church at <hi>Philippi</hi> in the beginning of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. at which time we have no more converſions expreſſed but of thoſe two families; at leaſt, they were the moſt eminent fruits of <hi>Pauls</hi> Miniſtery at that time; and it is very probable the Church was gathered in <hi>Lydia's</hi> houſe, ſeeing <hi>Paul</hi> going out of priſon to her houſe, he is ſaid to ſee the Brethren, and comfort them, ſo departing, verſe 40. Beſides, why might not the Apoſtle baptize them into that particular viſible Church in ſuch a caſe, as well as into the Catholick, or all Churches, as ſome ſay, they profeſſing ſubjection to Chriſt in every ordinance of his, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to that Church he had there conſtituted? The fulneſſe of power in the Apoſtles might doe greater matters without breach of order, though no rule for us ſo to do; neither is it ſtrange from the practice of thoſe times to begin a Church in a family, ſeeing the Apoſtle ſpeaks of Churches in three ſeverall families, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.5. <hi>Col.</hi> 4.15. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. which though many underſtand to be called Churches in regard of the godlineſſe of thoſe families; yet if we conſider; Firſt, how many eminent Saints the Apoſtle ſalutes, (who no doubt had godly families) not ſo much as naming their houſholds; much leſſe giving them ſuch a title, but onely to theſe three named. Secondly, how diſtinct his ſalutations are, firſt the <hi>Governors, and then the Church in their houſe.</hi> Thirdly, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle doth not onely ſend his ſalutations to the Church in the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:60763:61"/>
houſe of <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priſcilla, Rom.</hi> 16.5. but alſo keeping the name of a Church, he ſends ſalutations from that Church to the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.19. All which doe ſtrongly argue there is more in it, then that they were godly families, and therefore may perſwade us that there were indeed conſtituted Churches in thoſe Families, though other Chriſtians alſo might joyn with them.</p>

               </label> Thus having cleared our meaning, and the conſideration it ſelf, there will remain very few extraordinary caſes, (if any) of whom it can be proved, they were not joyned to ſome particular Church when baptized; as that of the Eunuch, which as it was done by an extraordinary immediate call of <hi>Philip</hi> ſo to doe; ſo alſo there was a ſpeciall reaſon thereof, the Lord intending there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, rather by him to ſend the Goſpel into <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> then to retain him in any other place, to joyn with his Church: And the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm of <hi>Paul,</hi> who as without the Miniſtery of the Word he was converted by the immediate voice of Chriſt, ſo he was baptized by the immediate call of <hi>Ananias</hi> ſo to do.

               <hi>The ſeals Baptiſm and the Lords-ſupper are given to the Church, not onely in ordinary, but alſo extraordinary diſpenſation: True Baptiſm is not without the Church, but in it, an ordinance given to it. The Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are the ſeales of the Covenant to the faithfull, which is the form of the Church tokens and pledges of our ſpirituall admittance into the Lords family.

            <p n="1">1 When we ſay the Miniſtery is limited to a particular Church, wee doe not ſo limit it to a Congregation under her owne Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery, as to exclude from communion in the ſeales, many Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations ſtanding under one common Presbytery, as wee have formerly ſaid, we honour the reformed Churches of Chriſt Jeſus, and the godly members thereof.</p>

<pb n="133" facs="tcp:60763:68"/>
his Office to thoſe in an other church, over whom he is no Officer, wee ſee not but he may; but then this act of power is not towards them as over his owne flocke; for two things are cleare to us. 1. That an Officer of one Church, is no Officer over thoſe of an other Church, as not being his proper flocke, for there being no Office of Paſtour at large without power of Office, and the power that a Paſtour hath over others, being by the election of thoſe that choſe him their Officer, who thereby become his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per flocke, hence he hath no power as an Officer over thoſe of an other flock, unleſſe he ſhould <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>That ſuch an officer may put forth acts of his office towards thoſe that are not of his proper flock. <hi>E. g.</hi> A Miniſter <hi>ex officio,</hi> &amp; as a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor, not barely as a gifted man only may preach for the gathering in of thoſe that are out of the Church, as well as for the edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thoſe that are within, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 4.11, 12. and yet theſe are not his proper flock; it is the office of every Paſtour to preach the Goſpel, the meanes of converting, and therefore not onely to intend but to attend the converſion of men, (eſpecially in preaching to his owne Congregation) for Chriſt hath ſheep, (which are his flock) to bee gathered into his fold, which are not the Miniſters pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per flock, and the Paſtour is the Miniſter of Chriſt, as well as the Paſtour of his owne flock, and therefore he is to intend their ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering in as well as the good of his owne flock.</p>
            <p>Againe, as he hath the Keys of Office by preaching the Goſpel, to open the Kingdome of heaven to beleevers, ſo alſo he may <hi>ex officio,</hi> ſhut it againſt impenitent ſinners and unbeleevers that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject his Doctrine, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.19. <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.14. <hi>Jer.</hi> 1.10. and yet theſe are not of his proper flocke.</p>
            <p>Againe, a Paſtour may adminiſter the Seales, (which is an act of Office) to members of other Churches, in his his owne Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, (if they deſire it) who yet are not his proper Flocke. Laſtly, a Deacon of one Church may performe an act of his Office occaſionally to thoſe out of the Church, or the poore of another Church; yet be no Officer or Deacon of the other Church, and ſo 'tis here.</p>
            <p>To illuſtrate this, A Captaine of a Band of Souldiers is an Officer onely over his owne Band, but it's an act of his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to ſubdue enemies, and to bring in thoſe that ſubmit. A Steward is an officer over his Maſters family, not over others: yet it's an act of his Office to provide for the intertainment
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:60763:69"/>
of Strangers that come to his Lords table.</p>
            <p>Thus far it is cleare: But now whether a Miniſter may admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter the Seales in another Congregation, is not ſo evident, yet wee will not deny but that occaſionally being called thereunto by the deſire of the Church, hee may lawfully doe the ſame, yet it's no foundation of a ſtated Presbytery out of a particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, for in all ſuch acts the Church ſtill keepes her power in her owne hands, while the Miniſter hath no authority, nor can put forth any act of his Miniſtery, but at her deſire, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to her owne neceſſity, neither doth this make a Miniſter a Paſtour of the univerſall Church, for paſtorall Office conſiſts in taking charge of a people, and having power of authority to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe the ſame towards his Church: But all that is ſaid doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude neither of theſe, nor doth it follow that becauſe they may ſet up a Presbytery over themſelves in the ſame Church, that therefore they may combine &amp; ſet up a Presbytery of many Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, the firſt being their duty injoyned by Chriſt, not the other; for it is neceſſary for them to have ſuch amongſt them as may or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily feed, teach, watch over them, and rule them (the end of a Miniſters Office) but it's not neceſſary ſo to ſubmit to others, who may finde worke enough to feed and rule their owne, and therefore looke as it is not in the power of many Congregations to joyne together, to ſet one Paſtour over them ſucceſſively to feed them, (for ſo they make a Pluraliſt, and the Bramble the King of trees) nor yet in their power to ſet up (as in the firſt ambitious time) a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> with power over all ſingly, but under all joyntly, ſo neither is it in their power to ſet up many Paſtours, who by their plurality of votes may wholly drowne that power of their owne.</p>
            <p>Nor laſtly doth it follow, that if they may deſire the benefit and exerciſe of an others Office occaſionally, that they may or ſhould doe it conſtantly, no more then becauſe they may deſire ſundry Miniſters to preach amongſt them every Sabbath for a time in the want of Officers, that therefore they ſhould content themſelves to live altogether without any of their owne.</p>
            <p>Now for application of theſe things to the aſſumption of our argument. Although a Paſtour (in the ſenſe explained) may put forth acts of Office in another Congregation, or to others in his owne Congregation, yet will it hence follow, that a Miniſter may adminiſter Seales to ſuch as are of no Congregation? which is now the queſtion.</p>

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:60763:73"/>
Church in Covenant before, to whom hee was ſent to turne the heart of the fathers to the children, &amp;c. and to prepare a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for the Lord, and baptiſme was then given to the Church of the Jewes with reference to ſo many as would receive the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>John,</hi> concerning repentance and remiſſion of ſinnes by faith in the Meſſiah now come amongſt them, and therefore Chriſt himſelfe, and his Diſciples remained yet members of that Church.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Though the viſible Kingdome of Chriſt was not yet to bee erected in Chriſtian Churches, till after Chriſts death and Reſurrection, whereby hee did put an end to the Jewiſh worſhip, and therefore no Chriſtian Churches could bee gathered by <hi>John,</hi> yet there was a middle ſtate of a people prepared for the Lord, gathered out of the Jewiſh Church, which according to that ſtate were made the Diſciples of <hi>John,</hi> by ſolemne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of their repentance or converſion to God, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of Chriſt the Lambe of God already come, to whom the ſeale of baptiſme was appropriated.

            <p>Secondly, Members of any true viſible Church are ſubject, and ſo capable of cenſure, (though not in another Church) which is not in in the propoſition. 2.

               </label> This ſeemeth to touch the queſtion it ſelfe, rather then the propoſition of this fourth conſideration: but wee ſhall anſwer to it as it ſtands. 1. Here you grant that a perſon baptized, is baptized unto a particular Congregation: which wee accept as a yeelding of the queſtion unawares. 2. If you meane, that ſuch hath a liberty of Communion in a way of brotherly love in all Churches where he comes, wee grant, (ſo farre as nothing in him juſtly hinder) but if you meane that hee is baptized in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all Churches, ſo as to challenge a right of Memberſhip in them all, wee deny it, as a poſition that would take away all diſtinction of Churches, as wee have formerly ſhewed. 3. We deny that the Lords Supper is the priviledge of a baptized perſon, able to examine himſelf, &amp; walking in the truth as a baptized per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, for then a Papiſt converted to the truth, able to examine himſelfe, hath a right to the Lords Supper in every Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he make any profeſſion of his converſion, and faith in any particular Church, for hee may bee ſuch a baptized perſon. And we may ſay the like of an excommunicate penitent. 4. We grant that a baptized perſon is not onely baptized in to that particular Church whereof hee was firſt a member: For if it bee a ſeale of his initiation into that particular Church onely, then he muſt bee rebaptized as oft as hee enters into another, but hee is bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized (in the ſenſe formerly ſhewed) into the whole myſticall Body of Chriſt, and hence hath <hi>jus ad rem,</hi> or a remote right
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:60763:74"/>
unto the priviledges of the Church every where, but that therefore he hath immediate right to the fruition of all, when he is ſevered from that particular church wherein he was baptized, that follows not: for as he had this latter right in the firſt Church wherein hee was baptized, ſo he muſt have it in any of the Churches of Chriſt afterward; now if in the firſt Church the fruition of ordinances came by orderly joyning to it: ſo it muſt be afterward, for as wee ſaid before, ſuch as the communion is, ſuch ought to be the union, he that would have politicall communion with the politicall Churches of Chriſt, muſt be ſome where in politicall union with them, otherwiſe one may have communion in all Churches &amp; yet never unite himſelf to any one, which looſe walking we are perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Chriſt Jeſus will not allow. 5 The ſimilitude from a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed perſon will not hold.

               </label> What is here objected from the liberty or reſtriction of Church members in another Congregation, is anſwered before in the firſt objection, and therefore the propoſition may ſtand good for all that is here ſaid. 2 That which is ſet down as the propoſition, is neither the ſame with that in our reaſon, nor any way allowed by us; for wee ſpeake not here of power to admit, but of the right to bee partakers: neither doe wee deny a power in officers to admit members of other Churches to the ſeales, though they have no power to excommunicate them. 3 If our propoſition ſeeme to need proofe: the reaſon of it is at hand, becauſe thoſe that are the peculiar priviledges or proper priviledges or proprieties of the Church, as ſeales and cenſures being of the ſame nature, <hi>viz.</hi> outward ordinances of Chriſt ordained by him for the

            <p n="2">2 If this bee ſo as here you urge, then thoſe former aſſertions muſt needs fall to the ground; as, <hi>That every ſociety in covenant with God is the true Church of God, page</hi> 23. <hi>and that it is ſimply neceſſary to the being of a Church, that it bee layd upon Chriſt the foundation, which being done, the remaining of what is forbidden, or want of what is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, cannot put the ſociety from the right and title of a Church.</hi> If theſe were ſo a company of unbaptized perſons may bee a Church, being in Covenant with God and layd on Chriſt the foundation, though they want baptiſme.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Though no ſuch example of unbaptized perſons chooſing a Paſtour among themſelves can bee ſhewed, when there was no need thereof; (Apoſtles being at hand to baptize them) yet why in abſence of Apoſtles, &amp;c. might they not chooſe ſome other baptized Chriſtian, who comming into ſome farre remote coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of Infidels, is a meanes of their converſion; wee ſee nothing to hinder: it would bee hard for any to ſhew an example of Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters holding a Synod or ordaining of Elders, without Apoſtles or ſome extraordinary officer, yet we ſuppoſe, you make no doubt of ſuch things.</p>

And wee have obſerved more then once your plaine confeſſion that the Apoſtles conſtituted Churches by baptiſme, even ſuch Churches as they ſet Elders in by the electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the people.</p>

               </label>
               <hi>The ſecond reaſon in ſubſtance is this, becauſe from Chriſt and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant practiſe of the Apoſtles we learne, that ſuch as are called of God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the holy Ghoſt, beleeve in the Lord, profeſſe their faith in him with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and amendment of life, have a right to baptiſme, and deſiring it are wronged if they bee deprived thereof.</hi>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reply. </seg>
               </label> Thirdly, <hi>By a lively faith a man hath internal Communion with Chriſt, by profeſſion of the intire faith joyned with conformity of life in righteouſnes,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:60763:84"/>
holineſſe and fellowſhip of love, hee is a member of the viſible Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or flock of Chriſt, though no ſet member of a free Independent ſociety: and baptiſme is a ſeale of our admiſſion into the flocke of Chriſt; not ever more, but by accident, of our receiving into a particular Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
               </label> This reaſon ſtands upon ſuch a ſenſe of the Catholik Church as cannot be found: and it was before confeſſed that the Catholick Church conſiſteth of all true particular Churches, as the parts of it. And therefore how can a man be viſibly a member of the whole, and belong to no part thereof?</p>
            <p>Secondly, We deny not but ſuch have a right to be in the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Church, and ſo to baptiſme and all ordinances? but as by ſuch profeſſion they are not members of any particular Church, ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have they immediate right to the priviledges thereof with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out admittance into the ſame. Fit matter, ſuch are for a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar viſible Church that profeſſe the intire faith, &amp;c. But it doth not admit them actually thereunto: and your owne expreſſion ſecretly implyeth as much, when you ſay baptiſme is a ſeale of our admiſſion into the Church or flocke of Chriſt; If baptiſme bee the ſeale of our admiſſion, then there is an admiſſion thereunto before baptiſme: but who doth admit, and where, and when is any admitted to the Church, but in particular Congregations? Can any bee admitted into a Church, that whole Church being ignorant thereof? but a man may profeſſe the intire faith, and live accordingly amongſt the Heathen, where neither any Church nor member of it take knowledge thereof; and therefore bare profeſſion doth not admit men, but make them fit to bee received and admitted into the viſible Church.</p>

               <hi>Then the Apoſtles in diſpenſing ſeales walked by rules of Scripture and grounds common to us, and then the difficulty remaining is onely this: Whether a Paſtour may diſpenſe ſeales to ſuch as have right to them and do orderly deſire them, though hee be not yet a ſet member of a Congregation.</hi>

               </label> Wee grant the Apoſtles ordinarily and generally baptized up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on common grounds, but ſtill when they did ſo they received them into ſome particular Church; and ſo baptized them: and in the like orderly way any paſtour may doe the ſame.

To give one inſtance in ſtead of many: the Apoſtles preached the Goſpel to gather in the elect of God and to edifie the Church &amp;c. and Miniſters upon the ſame common grounds muſt now preach the Goſpel alſo: yet in that the Apoſtles on thoſe grounds preached to all Nations, this doth not warrant Miniſters now to do the like: ſo here though we baptize beleevers as they did, yet wee may not do it to all in all caſes as they did.

But ſeeing wee are led by this learned author from this particular queſtion about excommunication to that beaten controverſie of the power of the Keyes in generall, and the firſt ſubject thereof, whereby wee are forced to declare our ſelves herein; wee ſhall briefly gleane up ſome few of our ſcattered apprehenſions, as may moſt concerne the caſe in hand.</p>
            <p n="1">1 There are divers Keyes that are diverſly diſtributed to ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſubjects in reſpect of execution, and therefore the queſtion ſhould have beene firſt ſtated: and what Keyes are denied to the people and appropriated to the Officers. And what to ſome Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, not to others, ſhould have been ſhewed before Arguments were preſſed.</p>

            <p n="3">3 The officiall power of the Keyes is a power to act with au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in the name of Chriſt miniſterially in opening and ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, binding and looſing, &amp;c. In reſpect of which Office (while the Miniſter acts according to the will of Chriſt) he is over the Church in things properly Eccleſiaſticall, becauſe hee ſtands in the roome of Chriſt, and comes in his name, and hence in thoſe Church acts which are not proper to him, but common in ſome caſes to the fraternitie, yet there is an office-authority upon them, which is not upon the like acts materially done by others. <hi>Ex. gr.</hi> Any brother may and ought to exhort and rebuke, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.14. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Titus</hi> a Miniſter is exhorted to doe the ſame thing, but with all authority, <hi>Titus</hi> 2.15. ſome able and gifted, though not in Office, may occaſionally open and apply the word, yet not with an Office-authority. But an Officer preacheth as an Ambaſſadour of Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. So alſo in admiſſion of mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and caſting out of offenders (wherein though the fraterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty have a power whether in conſenting or otherwiſe) yet they act obedientially in reſpect of their guides, declaring the rule, going
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:60763:88"/>
before them in example, and commanding them (if need bee) in the name of Chriſt to doe his pleaſure. But the Officers act in theſe things in the name and authority of him in whoſe roome they ſtand, and hence wee thinke that in caſe the fraternity with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Officers ſhould caſt out any, yet it is not altogether the ſame with that which may bee diſpenſed by the Officers thereof, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no officiall act.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Fraternall power (in publike Church acts) is a joynt power of liberty or priviledge (in ſome ſenſe, &amp; in ſome caſes) to open, &amp; ſhut, which power is not in any one or more ſeverally; but in the whole joyntly, for as they have power to combine, and ſo to receive others into the communion, ſo by like reaſon to ſhut out offenders from their communion; but thus they do fraternally, not officially: and as they have ſuch a power of election of Officers to them, ſo they have alſo a fraternall power (due order being attended) to ſhut them out (when there is juſt cauſe) according to the common received rule, <hi>Cujus eſt inſtituere, ejuſdem eſt &amp; deſtituere.</hi>

            <p>Theſe things which might bee more fully explained and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, wee have onely briefly ſet downe both to waſh off the blot of popular Government from the wayes of Chriſt, as if all au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority were taken from the Miniſters, or nothing left them but to diſpenſe the ſeales, and in all other things to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

If any Miniſter and people of old acquaintance and deare affection, or any other Chriſtians cleaving together in love have privatly reſolved or agreed together, not to part from each others in any Church, it is the moſt that wee have taken knowledge of, and wee thinke that hath beene very rare, but for any ſuch publick promiſe, Covenant, or Church oath, (as ſome ſtraining things to the height have called it) it is not, nor hath been required or practiſed amongſt us: this being ſo, there needs no grounds of that which wee practiſe not.</p>

               </label> Here is a greater heape of heavy criminations gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and caſt upon us, upon very weake grounds, upon miſtakes, ſuſpitions, and (wee feare) too much credulitie given to ſome clamorous perſons, returning to England, and too little credit given to our true relations and faithfull profeſſions: moſt of theſe have beene cleared in the former paſſages where wee met with them, and wee marvell how they come in ſo twiſted together here againe; wee ſhall here onely cleare our ſelves of the firſt, and referre the Reader to their proper places to ſee our anſwer to the others.</p>
            <p>Here it is imputed unto us that wee have deviſed a rite to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the unity and prevent the diſſolutions of the body, which wee conceive is intended of this promiſe of not removall with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out leave, which promiſe is not required of us nor made in our Church Covenant, (as wee have ſaid) and the ground of this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation is alſo a meere miſtake ariſing from the confounding of a ſecond anſwer to the objection againſt our firſt reaſon, with the ſecond reaſon of our practiſe, which are diſtinct and have a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:60763:95"/>
ſcope, for whereas ſome might object, that this reaſon from the Covenant, holds with ſuch as grant ſuch a Covenant lawfull, the anſwer ſaith that ſome indeed queſtion the neceſſitie of it: but wee hope you doe not queſtion the lawfulneſſe, and thereupon the anſwer firſt gives reaſons and proofes of the lawfulneſſe of it. And ſecondly, for the neceſſitie which is taken from the nature of all ſocieties incorporate, which by a fundamentall rule, doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of all that enter into them, and partake of the priviledges thereof, to conforme to all ſuch lawfull rites and orders as are expedient for the well being of that ſociety; the contrary whereof would bee injurious to him to offer, and confuſion in them to accept; and from hence it eaſily followes, that a Church being a body of a people injoying priviledges together, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary fundamentally that they ſhould bee joyned in ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe or Covenant, which Covenant (though in civill ſocieties it may conſiſt in rites and orders deviſed by themſelves for their good) yet in the Church which is the body of Chriſt, this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is no other but to performe the duties required in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel towards God and one another, without any rites or order, deviſed by themſelves, as wee profeſſed in ſetting forth the nature of the Covenant; and this being the true ſcope of thoſe words, let any judge what ground is given by us of ſuch an imputation of deviſing rites, &amp;c. Neither doth the ſecond reaſon in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer give any ground of this imputation; for though it diſpute from the neceſſary ruine of the Church, and all Churches, if it were lawfull for any member when, whither and wherefore hee pleaſe to depart from the Church without conſent: yet there is not one ſyllable that gives an hint of any rite, cuſtome or order deviſed by us, to prevent the ſame, but for the avoyding thereof wee ſtill wholly and onely bind our ſelves to the rule of the Word, to direct, order, and reforme all actions of this nature, and to ſhew unto men whether they may lawfully remove or not remove, not requiring any expreſſe promiſe to the contrary in this particular no more then in others; and thus wee hope wee have reſolved you of our practiſe, as you deſired. To conclude this paſſage, give us leave without offence to ſay thus much.</p>
            <p>Although (through the grace of Chriſt) we deſire humbly to ſubmit to this part of our tryall, even to goe through evill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port as well as good, yea all the reproaches and cruell mockings of the world, knowing that wee have deſerved much more from

But wee muſt confeſſe wee meet with ſo many ſore criminations, (oft upon meere miſtakes) caſt not onely upon our ſelves, but the truth and wayes of God, which wee profeſſe, and that both by this lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned author and ſome others, that wee cannot be ſo ſenſeleſſe of the diſhonour is reflected upon the truth of God herein, as whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to bee ſilent, and groane out the griefe of our ſpirits to him that knoweth our hearts: wherefore wee humbly beſeech all our godly brethren, to beare with us a little, if after all the harſh paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of this Reply, ſuch an heape of accuſations as are here throwne upon us, move us to preſent to the Reader a ſhort view of ſuch things as are unjuſtly and ungroundedly caſt upon us, and which wee cannot but thinke hath drawne a black cloud over the glory of the holy Diſcipline of Chriſt which hee hath here ſet up among us.</p>

            <p>Againe <hi>ibidem</hi> ſaith hee, wee thinke the Church is over-rigid in exacting ſuch a condition of the members, and the members goe beyond their meaſure as buſie bodies, and what is the ground? It followes, <hi>If</hi> they arrogate ſuch a power to themſelves.</p>
            <p>So page next 80. In the word it is not commanded that no member ſhould remove or occaſionally be abſent from the place of his habitation before he have acquainted the congregation whither he goeth, on what occaſion, &amp;c. To what end is this inſerted if not to ſuggeſt that there is ſuch a practiſe among us that a man may not occaſionally be abſent, &amp;c. which is far from us?

            <p>But what is the ground of this feare conceived and publiſhed to the world, <hi>viz. If</hi> ſuch buſineſſes muſt bee determined on the Lords day? and that before the Ordinances, &amp;c. becauſe it ſeemes <hi>Robinſon</hi> in caſe of ſome notorious obſtinate offender, would have ſome cenſure paſſed to prevent pollution of an Ordinance; and is this ground ſufficient?</p>
            <p>Againe in the ſame page (for theſe things are thick ſowne) <hi>Herein,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>you have deviſed an expedient or neceſſary rite or cuſtome to preſerve unity, &amp;c.</hi> but if you ſeeke a ground it will bee found a miſtake, as is ſhewed before, and contrary to the expreſſe profeſſion of the Anſwer, That wee promiſe no new duties, but onely ſuch as the Goſpell requires of all Saints in Church order, much leſſe doe wee ſet up new rites and cuſtomes.</p>
            <p>And as if all theſe particular imputations in the compaſſe of one leafe were two little, Page next 81. wee have a whole Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue gathered together from other places and this, that by lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things together the <hi>odium</hi> raiſed might ſtick the deeper: for thus the words are, <hi>But to preſſe cuſtomes expedient for the time as ſtanding rules, neceſſary at all times and all perſons; To put authority in the hands of men which God never put upon them, and to oblige them to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termeddle; To bind the conſciences of men, and that upon ſo heavy a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naltie as the ſinne of</hi> Ananias <hi>and</hi> Saphira, <hi>where God hath not bound it;

            <p>Theſe things wee have thus briefly preſented in one view not to diſhonour the learned and reverend Author, whoſe memory wee honour; two things we charitably take notice of, to remove o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hard thoughts of him: Firſt, wee conſider his ſpirit might bee over grieved and provoked to this harſhneſſe by the withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of many Chriſtians from the Ordinances of God becauſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed according to the corrupt Liturgy, in which cauſe he ſtood too farre ingaged, and ſuppoſing <hi>New-England</hi> wayes the cauſe of it, he was the more ſharpe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, wee conſider that this Reply was not intended by him to be publiſhed to the world, but to be ſent unto us, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is in our hearts the leſſe blamable.</p>
            <p>But ſeeing theſe things are now publiſhed, and the harſhneſſe thereof may do much hurt, wee were preſſed to cleare our ſelves, wherein if any thing reflect upon the Author or Publiſhers, wee cannot avoyd it.</p>
            <p>Neither doe wee write thus as if wee would wholly juſtifie our ſelves and all the particular miſcarriages that happily at one time or other, in ſome Church or other may have happened; we have much cauſe to humble our ſelves before our God and abaſe our ſelves to the duſt before men, for all the weakeneſſes, ſinnes, er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and miſcarriages that have beene found among us, in one kind and another.</p>
            <p>Onely this wee may profeſſe before the Lord and his people, that in the maine ſcope of our hearts and indeavours of our lives wee have ſought after ſuch a forme of worſhip, and frame of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline, as we could conceive by the Word of God and the helpe of the beſt Reformers to bee according to the will of Chriſt, not allowing our ſelves in any evill diſcovered unto us, but beway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling our great defects in all.</p>

God required of them, that (being of yeares of diſcretion) were to bee baptized, that they ſhould make knowne to the Congregation or their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter their, faith and repentance, hee doth every whit as much require this of them that are to come to the Lords Supper. Whereby we ſee, 1. that his judgement was that, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. and <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. the people did make known their ſpirituall eſtate to the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Miniſter, when they profeſſed faith and repentance: and ſecondly, that the ſame ought now ſo to bee. Laſtly, We may appeale herein to the conſciences of very many godly Miniſters, in our deare <hi>England,</hi> whether they groane not under the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the precious with the vile, in the Ordinances of Chriſt, and would not gladly have it otherwiſe, which cannot bee without ſuch a way of admiſſions into the Church as we plead

for, or elſe in conſtituted (but corrupted) Churches, by caſting out ſuch as after admonitions appeare impenitent in ſin, by the ſeverity of diſcipline.</p>
            <p>And this was evident by the qualifications of perſons to be received to the Lords Table, voted at firſt by the preſent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Aſſembly, and preſented in their Directory to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, if wee bee not miſ-informed: whoſe words are theſe, <hi>None are to bee admitted thereto (meaning the Lord Suppers) but ſuch as being baptized are found upon carefull examination by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, before the other Church-Officers, to have a competent meaſure of knowledge and ability to examine themſelves, and profeſſe their willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to ſubmit themſelves to all the Ordinances of Chriſt, and are of approved converſation according to Chriſt: the ignorant and ſcandalous are not to bee admitted, nor thoſe of another Congregation, unleſſe they have ſufficient teſtimony or be very well knowne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If it bee objected, that ſome of theſe inſtances concerne un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized perſons onely, which is not our caſe; <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of baptized perſons in theſe dayes are as ignorant and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane as ſome unbaptized; and therefore as apt to pollute Gods Ordinances: 2. <hi>Chamiers</hi> reaſon, why unbaptized perſons were to go under ſuch ſtrict examination, holds good in our caſe. 3.

            <p>The power of the Church in electing her Officers is ſo cleare in the Scripture, and ſo confeſſed a truth by the godly learned, that it cannot bee denyed, yet here ſeeme to be given ſo many reſtrictions in the caſe, that they much abate and weaken this great and precious liberty and power given by the Lord. 1. That the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Office of a Paſtor is immediately from Chriſt by his inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution is granted, but the queſtion is, how this man comes to have this Office applyed to him; if immediately, then hee is in this an Apoſtle, if mediately, it is by the Church, or elſe ſhew by whom. 2.

Which of them doth Chriſt deſigne, but whom the Church freely chooſe? and therefore that is no diminution of their power, that they muſt chooſe miniſterially, and whom Chriſt ſo deſignes. The caſe is alike in all other Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances diſpenſed, Examination is immediately from Chriſt, by his inſtitution, the perſon to be cenſured is deſigned or deſcribed by Chriſt, a notorious or obſtinate ſinner: the Church paſſe this ſentence onely Miniſterially, and yet puts forth a great power of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in applying the ſentence to this or that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: and ſo here: and therefore it is ſtrange to us, that any ſhould ſay they depute this Officer neither vertually nor formally, when

as the act which they put forth, (which is the outward call of the Officer) muſt needs come from a power formally in the Church to doe the ſame, as well as when the Church or Officers cenſure an offender, &amp;c.</p>

               </label> It is to bee noted, that here wee diſpute of the outward calling of Church-Officers; now the very eſſence of any outward cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, doth lye in the right and power of them that elect. If all the Countries of <hi>England</hi> ſhould elect or call a Lord Major for <hi>London,</hi> bee they never ſo many and wiſe, it is a meere nullity, and why? Becauſe the right of election is not in them, but if the Citizens in whom the right lyes, doe elect (though weakly) hee hath the true eſſence of the call: if others electing a Major the City will receive him, ſubmit to him, and ſo give their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, hee may bee ſaid to have the ſubſtance of that call, though not an orderly and lawfull election, and ſo maymed: ſo it is here.</p>

way of election,) the proper right and power bee ſeated by Chriſt in the Church, unto whom they are to miniſter, then it muſt needs follow, that the very eſſence of a Miniſters call ſtands in their election, or at leaſt in their after conſent and ſubjection to his Miniſtery, in which caſe wee grant though the calling be maymed, yet it hath the ſubſtance of a true calling. But if the people will not receive ſuch as are impoſed upon them, hee hath no call at all, but uſurpes the ſame, and it is a meer nulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And therefore it concernes Churches the more to conſider, what they doe in receiving and ſubmitting to ſuch unworthy Miniſters, as are oft impoſed upon them; but if the right and power of electing Miniſters bee in any other Perſons, let it be ſhewed from the Scriptures, for we are not much moved in ſuch caſes with the corrupt cuſtomes of after-times.</p>
            <p>And this alſo ſhewes what kinde of call ſuch men have that are ordained by Prelates at large without any election at all, if they be Miniſters to the Catholike Church, then the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church is bound to receive them, and ſubmit to their Office, but no part of the Catholike Church, and therefore not the whole is bound to ſubmit to them, and therefore indeed they have no of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice nor calling as Paſtors or Teachers, except it can be proved they be Evangeliſts, Apoſtles or Prophets.</p>

               <pb n="208" facs="tcp:60763:107"/>Firſt, If our meaning be doubtfull, ſeeing theſe expreſſions doe not well ſuite our notion, nor fully enter into our underſtanding, we ſhall give the meaning of our anſwer diſtinctly, and then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what is here ſaid.</p>
            <p>Firſt, there is a difference betweene the unjuſt leaving or caſting off a Miniſter, without all orderly proceedings againſt him, and the unjuſt depoſing him in an orderly way of Church cenſure: if the queſtion be taken in the firſt ſenſe, he remaines every way and in every reſpect by right a Miniſter as hee was before, except he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject them, and ſo diſſolve the relation that was between them. But if the queſtion ſpeak of an orderly cenſure of depoſition unjuſtly, then we judge of that caſe as we would do in any other, cenſure of a member by excommunication, &amp; therefore we ſay, he is ſtil a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, <hi>in f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ro interno</hi> before Chriſt, for <hi>clavis errans non ligat.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in reſpect of that Church he hath ſtil right truly to miniſter to them, and is their Miniſter though unjuſtly hindered in the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Miniſtery, as a member unjuſtly cenſured hath a true right to the Ordinances, and memberſhip, though unjuſtly hindred from the ſame, though <hi>in foro externo,</hi> we grant to them or in their account he is no Miniſter, as a perſon excommunicated is to them no member.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, in reſpect of other Churches, if it doth appeare unto them that hee is unjuſtly depoſed, they may and ought to eſteeme him ſtill, and receive him and have communion with him, as a true Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt, in the Church he doth belong to, as they may do with a member unjuſtly caſt out, but til that appeare unto them, they cannot ſo eſteem and honor him, (being orderly depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed but muſt at leaſt ſuſpend their judgment til the caſe be cleared.</p>
            <p>Fourthly we anſwer clearely and plainely to the chiefe ſcope of the queſtion, If a Miniſter bee unjuſtly depoſed or forſaken by his particular Church, and he alſo withall renounce and forſake them, ſo farre as all Office and relation betweene them ceaſe, then is hee no longer an Officer or Paſtour in any Church of God, whatſoever you will call it. And the Reaſon is, becauſe a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters office in the Church is no indelible Character, but conſiſts in his relation to the flocke: and if a Miniſter once ordained, his relation ceaſing, his Office of a Miniſter, Steward of the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of God ſhall ſtill remaine; why ſhould not a ruling Elder or Deacon remaine an Elder or Deacon in the Church as well? all are Officers Ordained of Chriſt alike given to his Church, Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers

            <p>Secondly, wee ſhall now conſider what is here ſaid, and firſt this language of a Miniſter in the uſuall Church as a particular Church hath union with and is a part of the univerſall, it is an unuſuall expreſſion to us, and to the Scripture phraſe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore beare with us if wee fall ſhort of your meaning; the uſuall Church in <hi>England</hi> hath beene either the Arch-Deacons Church in the Deana<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>But if by uſuall Church you meane a Claſſical, Provinciall or Nationall Church, wee muſt intreat better grounds for any of theſe, and therefore wee muſt confeſſe our minde and meaning is not ſo, that wee looke at a Miniſter of a particular Church in any ſuch relation to the uſuall and intermediate Church betweene it and the Catholique. The ſecond ſenſe therefore we owne and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge as before. But whether this be contrary to the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and practiſe of the univerſall Church, wee know not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is hard for us know what the univerſall Church judgeth, except we could heare it ſpeake or ſee its practiſe; if the onely head Prophet and Shepherd of the Church Jeſus Chriſt be fit to declare her judgement, we will be tryed thereby, who we know hath ſet Elders in every particular Church, <hi>Act.</hi> 14.23. to watch over their particular flock, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28. but not over any other Church that wee can finde. Neither doth this deſtroy the unity or Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Catholique Church, nor of particular Churches one with another as is ſaid, for Churches may enjoy brotherly Communion one with another, without ſuch ſtated formes, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the power and authority of one another, as hath been ſhewed before.</p>

               <hi>And whereas you ſay the Miniſter is for the Miniſtery, and the Office for the execution, and ſo the Paſtor and the flocke are relatives, and therefore if their election gave him authority among them to feed, their c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

               </label> Wee grant it is ſo, yet the execution may bee unjuſtly hindred, though the right and Office remaine: But we may well retort this argument upon the Miniſter of the uſuall or Catholicke Church. Thus if the Miniſter bee for the Miniſtery, and the Office for the execution, and ſo the Paſtor and flock be relatives, then hee that may juſtly for ever be hindred of all execution of the Miniſtery and hath no power to cenſure his flock, or cannot ſo much as juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly approve, and admoniſh them for the ſame, ſurely hee hath a poore Office and Miniſtery, but ſuch a Miniſter that hath no parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Congregation, that is his flock under his charge, may juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:60763:108"/>
be excluded out of all Churches, and cannot cenſure or reprove his Catholique or uſuall Church for the ſame, therefore he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed no Miniſter, and and hath no Office in the Church of God.</p>

               </label> Concerning our true ſenſe and meaning in our anſwer to this Poſition wee have ſpoken in the ſecond conſideration of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and third Poſitions, to which wee referre the Reader, onely here wee muſt ingenuouſly confeſſe that our expreſſion, That a Miniſter exerciſing in another Church, doth it not by vertue of any calling, but onely by his gifts, is not ſo cleare, but may oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion ſtumbling, yet the the next words following doe fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe our mindes, <hi>viz.</hi> that he doth not put forth ſuch a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteriall act of authority and power in diſpenſing of Gods Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, as a Miniſter doth performe to that Church, whereunto hee is called to be a Miniſter, for ſo hee doth not performe any Miniſteriall act with that authority: hee doth to his owne which further cleares up our expreſſion in the ſecond conſideration, <hi>viz.</hi> that he is a Paſtor of none but his proper flocke, although ſome acts of his Office may extend beyond his owne flocke, as we have ſhewed before; and therefore in this ſenſe we may ſtill conclude, that if the queſtion be put to any Miniſter (ſo exerciſing in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther church) which was once put to our Saviour, <hi>By what authority doſt thou theſe things</hi>? let him ſtudy how to give an anſwer, for wee have not yet learned it from this Reply. We confeſſe there are ſome godly learned ſervants of Chriſt, who poſſibly may bee otherwiſe minded, and thinke that a Miniſter preaching in another Congregation, doth it onely as a gifted man; as the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futer of Doctor <hi>Downam</hi> (with others in former times of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation) beleeved alſo. But we deſire that if any difference ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare herein, it may bee no prejudice to the ſame cauſe for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance wee maintaine, if by ſundry lines wee all meet at laſt in the ſame point.</p>
