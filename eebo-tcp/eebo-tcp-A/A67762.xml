            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Amidst so much variety, I have chosen to acquaint you
how one man differs from, and excels another in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and wisdom; and to prove that <hi>to be wise indeed, is the
portion but of a few,</hi> even in our <hi>Goshen,</hi> where is so much
means of Light and Grace.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:99129:2"/>
All sorts of men may be comprised under one of these
three Heads:
The
<list>
                  <item>Sensual.</item>
                  <item>Rational.</item>
                  <item>Spiritual.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>For if you observe it, some men like the <hi>Moon at Full,</hi> have
all their light towards earth, none towards heaven: Others
like the <hi>Moon at Wain</hi> or Change, have all their light to <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>
wards, none to the earth: a third sort like to the <hi>Moon in
Eclipse,</hi> as having no light in it self, neither towards <hi>earth,</hi> nor
towards <hi>heaven.</hi> Insomuch that one excels another (in wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom)
as the <hi>stars excel one another in glory.</hi> Of which particularly.</p>
            <p>First, There is no less difference between the <hi>rational</hi> and
<hi>sensual,</hi> the <hi>wise</hi> &amp; <hi>simple,</hi> the <hi>learned</hi> &amp; <hi>unlearned,</hi> then there is
between <hi>men</hi> and <hi>beasts,</hi> as <hi>Menander</hi> speaks; or between the
<hi>living</hi> and the <hi>dead,</hi> as another hath it: and yet the <hi>rational</hi> do
not so far excel the <hi>sensual,</hi> as the <hi>spiritual</hi> excel the <hi>rational.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Touching these <hi>three degrees of comparison,</hi> I begin with the
<hi>sensual.</hi> Sensual, or (as wise <hi>Solomon</hi> calls them) brutish men,
that have been ill bred, are so drowned in sin and sensuality,
and their spirits so frozen, and pitifully benummed with
worldliness, and wicked customs, that they cannot judge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,
either of spiritual matters, or rectified reason. They
know no other way then the <hi>flesh leads</hi> them. It is the <hi>weight</hi>
that sets all their <hi>wheels</hi> a going; the <hi>horses</hi> that draw their
<hi>chariot,</hi> the very <hi>life</hi> of their <hi>corruption,</hi> the <hi>corruption</hi> of their
<hi>life,</hi> without which they do nothing. Yea in matters <hi>divine</hi>
and <hi>spiritual,</hi> they are of as deep a judgement as was <hi>Callico,</hi>
who stuft his pillow (a brass pot) with straw, to make it soft.
Or that <hi>German Clown,</hi> who undertook to be very ready in
the <hi>ten Commandments,</hi> but being demanded by the <hi>Minister</hi>
which was the first, made answer, <hi>Thou shalt not eat.</hi> Or that
simple Fellow, who thought <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> must needs be a
<hi>Saint,</hi> because his name was put into the <hi>Creed.</hi> They are like
the <hi>Ostrich,</hi> Job 39. 17. whom <hi>God hath deprived of wisdom, &amp; to
whom he hath given no part of understanding.</hi> And which leaves
them without all hope of being wiser, they had rather keep
<hi>conscience blind,</hi> that it may <hi>flatter them,</hi> then <hi>inform it,</hi> that it
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:99129:3"/>
may give a <hi>just verdict against them;</hi> counting it less trouble to
believe a <hi>favorable falshood,</hi> then to examine <hi>whether it be true.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, They are so far from receiving instruction, that
they will scorn and scoff at their Admonishers. As do but
tell them of their <hi>swearing, drinking, whoring,</hi> you are sure to
be call'd <hi>Quaker, Phanatick,</hi> or the like. Yea what a clamour
will the <hi>blundering rabble</hi> make, if they but hear one reprove
a blasphemer, or any way endeavour to stop them in their
way to destruction? and what a number of sharp and dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>arrows</hi> will each of them shoot both at the <hi>good</hi> and <hi>good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
affirming with <hi>incredible impudence,</hi> accompanied with
<hi>invincible ignorance,</hi> that there are not <hi>worse</hi> men in the <hi>world,</hi>
then the <hi>Religious?</hi> and still <hi>the more sottish, the more censo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.</hi>
It is the nature of ignorant and carnal men, <hi>that walk
after the flesh, in the lusts of uncleanness,</hi> (whom St. <hi>Peter</hi> calls
<hi>Brute beasts led with sensuality, and made to be taken and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed)
to speak evil of the things which they understand not,
2 Pet. 2. 12.</hi> Nor will they <hi>believe</hi> any thing, but what they
<hi>see with their eyes,</hi> or <hi>feel with their fingers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as in <hi>spiritual,</hi> so in <hi>natural things</hi> also. <hi>An Ignorant
Rustick</hi> seeing <hi>a Geometrician drawing of Lines,</hi> not knowing
to what end he doth the same, is apt to judge him <hi>foolish</hi> and
<hi>phantastick:</hi> Tell <hi>a plain Country fellow</hi> that the <hi>Sun</hi> is bigger
then his <hi>Cart-wheel,</hi> and <hi>swifter in course</hi> then the best of his
<hi>Horses,</hi> he will laugh you to scorn: yea, I have red of <hi>a sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
Clown that killed his Ass</hi> for <hi>drinking up the Moon,</hi> which
he had a little before seen in the water: and of another, that
<hi>looking into his Well,</hi> and seeing <hi>face answer face,</hi> ran home in
all haste to call for <hi>aid to apprehend the thief.</hi> And commonly
as they <hi>have no reason,</hi> so they will <hi>hear none.</hi> Now he that
will <hi>learn</hi> of none but <hi>himself,</hi> hath <hi>a fool to his Teacher;</hi> and
<hi>such as refuse admonition, are bruitsh,</hi> as the <hi>holy Ghost</hi> affirms
Prov. 12. 1. <hi>And destroy their own souls,</hi> chap. 15. 32. By all
which it appears, that their <hi>knowledge</hi> is <hi>ignorance,</hi> their <hi>wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
folly,</hi> their <hi>sight blindness.</hi> They neither consider what
<hi>reason speaketh,</hi> or <hi>religion commandeth;</hi> but what the <hi>will</hi> &amp;
<hi>appetite affecteth.</hi> For <hi>will</hi> is the <hi>Axeltree, lusts</hi> and <hi>passions</hi> th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Adam</hi> should have done <hi>Eve. They that are after the flesh, do
mind the things of the flesh: The carnal mind is enmity against
God, for it is not subject to the Law of God, neither indeed can be,</hi>
Rom. 8. 5, to 9. So that it is impossible for fleshly minded
men, to believe what Sots they are, touching the good of
their souls. Wherefore when we see the <hi>folly</hi> and <hi>misery</hi> of
those that serve sin and Satan, and how peevishly averse they
are to their own eternal salvation, let us pity them, as being
so much more worthy our commiseration, as they are more
uncapable of their own misery. And so much of the first
sort, namely, <hi>Sensualists.</hi>

is accrued or obtained by <hi>education</hi> &amp; <hi>learning, observation</hi> &amp;
<hi>experience,</hi> called <hi>natural</hi> or <hi>speculative knowledge,</hi> or <hi>reason im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved.</hi>
For <hi>humane learning,</hi> is as <hi>oyl to the lamp</hi> of our <hi>reason,</hi>
and makes it burn clearer; but <hi>faith</hi> &amp; <hi>illumination</hi> of the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi>

glass</hi> does the <hi>corporal sight,</hi> Mat. 16. 17. 1 Cor. 2. 7, to 17. Joh. 12. 46.
For as the <hi>soul</hi> is the <hi>lamp</hi> of the <hi>body,</hi> and <hi>reason</hi> of the <hi>soul,</hi>
and <hi>religion</hi> of <hi>reason,</hi> and <hi>faith</hi> of <hi>religion;</hi> so <hi>Christ</hi> is the <hi>light</hi>
and <hi>life</hi> of Faith, <hi>Joh. 1. 9,</hi> &amp; 8. 12. <hi>Acts 26. 18. Ephes. 5. 14. Christ</hi> is
the <hi>sun</hi> of the <hi>soul, reason</hi> &amp; <hi>faith</hi> the <hi>two eyes:</hi> reason discerns
natural object, faith spiritual and supernatural. We may see
far with our bodily eye sense, farther with the minds eye
reason; but farther with the souls eye saith then with both.
And the <hi>believer</hi> hath the addition of <hi>Gods spirit,</hi> &amp; <hi>faith above</hi>
all other men. <hi>I am the ligh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

followeth me</hi> (meaning by a lively faith) <hi>shall not walk in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
but shall have the light of life,</hi> Joh. 8. 12. &amp; more see two
<hi>eyes</hi> then <hi>one;</hi> yea, the <hi>day</hi> with <hi>one eye,</hi> does far more things
<hi>descry,</hi> then <hi>night</hi> can <hi>do</hi> with more then <hi>Argos eyes.</hi> So that as
meer <hi>sense</hi> is uncapable of the rules of reason, so reason is no
less uncapable of the things that are <hi>divine</hi> and <hi>supernatural,</hi> Jer. 10. 14.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:99129:4"/>
1 Cor. 2. 14, 15, 16. Eph. 5. 8. And as to <hi>speak</hi> is onely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to <hi>men,</hi> so to know the secrets of the <hi>Kingdom of heaven,</hi>
is onely proper to <hi>believers,</hi> Psal. 25. 14. <hi>Prov. 3. 32. Amos 3. 7.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now of <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>speculative knowledge,</hi> the wicked have
as large a share as the godly; but of <hi>spiritual experimental</hi> and
<hi>saving knowledge,</hi> which is <hi>supernatural,</hi> and <hi>descendeth from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,
Jam. 3. 17. and keepeth a man from every evil way,</hi> Prov. 2.
12. the <hi>wicked</hi> have no part with the <hi>godly.</hi> Whence all men
in their natural condition are said to be <hi>blind &amp; in darkness,</hi>
Mat. 4. 16. &amp; 15. 14. <hi>Eph. 4. 18, 19.</hi> &amp; 5. 8. whereas <hi>believers</hi> are
called <hi>children of light, and of the day,</hi> 1 Thes. 5. 5. 1 Pet. 2. 9.</p>
            <p>Nor is this kind of knowledge any way attainable but by
grace from above. No learning, experience, or pains in study
and <hi>books,</hi> will bring them to it, <hi>Ephes. 1. 17, 18.</hi> &amp; 3. 19. except
they become <hi>new creatures,</hi> have <hi>hearts, eyes</hi> and <hi>ears</hi> sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from above, and that the <hi>holy Ghost</hi> becomes their teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<hi>Deut. 29. 2, 3. 4. Psal. 111. 10. Joh. 15. 15. Rom. 8. 14, 15.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor is it saving knowledge that they seek after: for though
many of them be great seekers after knowledge, great pains<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
to become wise; yet it is not divine and supernatural
knowledge that they labour for, or desire.</p>
            <p>Indeed <hi>wisdom</hi> in the largest sense, hath ever carried that
shew of excellency with it, that not only the <hi>good</hi> have high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>affected</hi> it, (as <hi>Moses</hi> who <hi>studied</hi> for wisdom, and <hi>Solomon</hi>
who <hi>prayed</hi> for wisdom, and the <hi>Queen of Sheba</hi> who <hi>travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi>
for wisdom, and <hi>David,</hi> who to get wisdom, <hi>made the word
his counsellour, hated every false way, and was a man after Gods
own heart)</hi> but the very <hi>wicked</hi> have laboured for it, who are
ashamed of other vertues; as, O the pleasure that rational
men take in it! <hi>Prov. 2. 3, 10, 11.</hi> &amp; 10. 14. <hi>Phil. 3. 8.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Knowledge</hi> is so <hi>fair a Virgin,</hi> that every clear eye is in love
with her; it is a <hi>Pearl</hi> despised of none but <hi>Swine,</hi> Prov. 2. 3,
10, 11. (whereas brutish and blockish men as little regard it)
they who care not for one dram of goodness, would yet have
a full scale of knowledge. Amongst all the trees of the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
none so pleaseth them as the <hi>tree of knowledge.</hi> And as
wisdom is excellent <hi>above all,</hi> so it is affected <hi>of all,</hi> as Oyl

was, both of the wise and foolish Virgins. It hath been a
Mark that every man hath shot at, ever since <hi>Eve</hi> sought to
be as wise as her Maker: but as an hundred shoot, for one
that hits the White; so an hundred aim at wisdom, for one
that lights upon it, <hi>Eccles. 7. 28.</hi> because they are mistaken in
the thing: for as <hi>Jacob</hi> in the dark mistook <hi>Leah</hi> for <hi>Rachel,</hi>
so many a blind soul takes that to be wisdom, which is not;
like <hi>Eve,</hi> who thought it wisdom to eat the forbidden fruit;
and <hi>Absalom,</hi> who thought it wisdom to lie with his Fathers

foolish, and turned to their own ruine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect. 3.</hi> But take some instances to prove that all sorts of
Naturians are Fools, in comparison of the Godly. I'll begin
with those that repute themselves, &amp; are reputed by others,
the wisest amongst men: And they are your <hi>profound Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nist,</hi>
and <hi>cunning Politicians,</hi> wherein you shall see, whether
the most and greatest number are not grosly mistaken in
their opinions and verdicts touching wisdom.</p>
            <p>First, for <hi>profound Humanists,</hi> a man would think that they
were incomparably wise, for none so thirst after knowledge
and wisdom as they, and to get it they are no niggards of
their labour: nor do they leave any thing unstudied but
themselves. They know all parts and places of the created
world, can discourse of every thing visible and invisible, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,
humane, and mundane, whether it be meant of substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
or accidents, are ignorant of nothing but the way to
heaven, are acquainted with all Laws and Customs, save the
Law of God, and Customs of Christianity; they are stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
no where but in the Court of their own Consciences:
Yea, they build as hard, and erect as high as did the <hi>Babel-builders,</hi>
but all to no purpose; they never come to the <hi>roof,</hi>
and when they die, they are undone. They spend all their
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:99129:5"/>
time in seeking after wisdom, as <hi>Alchimists</hi> spend all their <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states</hi>
to find out the <hi>Philosophers stone,</hi> but never find it; they
never attain to that, which is true wisdom indeed. For as
the <hi>ragged Poet</hi> told <hi>Petronius,</hi> that <hi>Poetry</hi> was a kind of
learning, that never made any man rich: so <hi>humane learning</hi>
of its self, never made a wise man.</p>
            <p>As thus (if I may be so bold) what is it, or what does it
profit a man, to have the etymology and derivation of wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and knowledge, without being affected with that which
is true wisdom indeed, to be able to <hi>decline vertue,</hi> yet <hi>not
love it?</hi> to have the <hi>theory,</hi> and be able to prattle of wisdom
by <hi>rote,</hi> yet not know what it is by <hi>effect</hi> and <hi>experience?</hi> To

the motion of the <hi>heavens,</hi> while his heart is buried in the

With the <hi>Historian,</hi> to know what others have <hi>done,</hi> and how
they have <hi>sped,</hi> while he neglects the imitation of such as
are gone the right way? With the <hi>Law-maker,</hi> to set down
many Laws in particular, and not to remember the <hi>common
Law</hi> of nature, or <hi>Law general</hi> that all must die? Or lastly,
with <hi>Adam</hi> to know the Nature of all the Creatures: and
with <hi>Solomon</hi> to be able to dispute of ever thing, even from
the <hi>Cedar</hi> to the <hi>Hyssop</hi> or <hi>Pellitory;</hi> when in the mean time
he lives like <hi>Dives,</hi> dies like <hi>Nabal,</hi> and after all goes to his

less <hi>costs, less pains,</hi> and far more <hi>quiet:</hi> That is but <hi>raw
knowledge,</hi> which is not <hi>digested</hi> into <hi>practice.</hi> It is not worth
the name of knowledge, that may be <hi>heard</hi> only and not
<hi>seen, Joh. 13. 17. Deut. 4. 6. Good discourse</hi> is but the <hi>froth of
wisdom:</hi> the sweet and <hi>solid fruit</hi> of it, is in <hi>well framed acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:</hi>
that is true knowledge, that makes the knower blessed.

What saies <hi>Aristotle?</hi> to be <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>happy</hi> are terms reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal.
And <hi>Socrates,</hi> That learning, saith he, pleaseth me
but a little, which nothing profits the owner of it, either to
<hi>vertue</hi> or <hi>happiness:</hi> And being demanded, Who was the
wisest and happiest man? He answered, He that offends least.
He is the <hi>best schollar</hi> that <hi>learns of Christ obedience, humility,</hi>
&amp;c. He is the best <hi>Arithmetician,</hi> that can <hi>add grace to grace;</hi>
he is the <hi>best learned,</hi> that knows how to be <hi>saved.</hi> Yea, all

            <p>
               <hi>Sect. 4.</hi> The <hi>best knowledge</hi> is about the <hi>best things;</hi> and the
perfection of all knowledge, to <hi>know God,</hi> and <hi>our selves:</hi>
Knowledge and learning, saith <hi>Aristotle,</hi> consisteth not so
much in the <hi>quantity,</hi> as in the <hi>quality;</hi> not in the <hi>greatness,</hi>
but in the <hi>goodness</hi> of it. A <hi>little gold</hi> (we know) is more
worth than <hi>much dross:</hi> a little <hi>Diamond,</hi> than a <hi>rockie
Mountain.</hi> So one drop of wisdom, guided by the fear of
<hi>God;</hi> one spark of spiritual, experimental, and saving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
is more worth than all humane wisdom and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
yea, one <hi>scruple of holiness,</hi> one <hi>dram of faith,</hi> one <hi>grain
of grace,</hi> is more worth than <hi>many pounds of natural parts.</hi>
And indeed, Faith and Holiness, are the nerves and sinews;
yea, the soul of saving knowledge.</p>
            <p>What saith <hi>Aristotle?</hi> No more then the knowledge of
goodness, maketh one to be named a good man; no more
doth the knowledge of wisdom alone, cause any person pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
to be called a wiseman. Saving knowledge of the truth,
works a love of the truth known: yea, it is a uniform con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
of knowledge and action. He only is wise, that is wise
for his own soul: he whose conscience pulleth all he hears
and reads to his heart, and his heart to <hi>God:</hi> who turneth
his <hi>knowledge</hi> to <hi>faith,</hi> his faith to <hi>feeling,</hi> &amp; all to vvalk wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of his <hi>Redeemer.</hi> He that subdues his <hi>sensual desires</hi> and
<hi>appetite,</hi> to the more <hi>noble faculties</hi> of <hi>reason</hi> and <hi>understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
and makes that understanding of his to serve him, by
whom it is, and doth understand. He that subdues his
<hi>lusts</hi> to his <hi>will,</hi> submits his will to <hi>reason,</hi> his reason to
<hi>faith;</hi> his saith, his reason, his will, himself, to the <hi>will of God:</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:99129:6"/>
this is practical, experimental, and saving knowledge; to
which the other is but a bare name, or title. <hi>A competent
estate</hi> (we know) <hi>well husbanded,</hi> is better than <hi>a vast patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
neglected.</hi> Never any meer man (since the first) knew so
much as <hi>Solomon;</hi> many that have known less, have had
more command of themselves.</p>
            <p>Alas! they are not always the wisest, that know most for
none more wise and learned in the worlds account, then the
<hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees;</hi> yet Christ calls them four times <hi>blind,</hi>
and twice <hi>fools</hi> in one chapter, Mat. 23. And the like of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam,
2 Pet. 2. 16.</hi> who had such a prophetical knowledge,
that scarce any of the Prophets had a clearer revelation of
the <hi>Messiah</hi> to come. And the same may be affirmed of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi>
and <hi>Achitophel;</hi> for many that know a great deal less, are
far wiser. Yea, one poor <hi>crucified thief,</hi> being <hi>converted,</hi> in
an hours time, had more true wisdom and knowledge infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
into him, then had all the <hi>Rulers, Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is very observable, what the <hi>high Priest</hi> told the <hi>Council,</hi>
as they were set to condemn <hi>Christ, Ye know nothing at all:</hi> he
spake truer then he meant it; for if we know not the <hi>Lord
Jesus,</hi> our knowledge is either <hi>nothing,</hi> or <hi>nothing worth.</hi> Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a man knows no more then he practiseth. It is said of
<hi>Christ, 2 Cor. 5. 21.</hi> that he <hi>knew no sin,</hi> because he <hi>did no sin:</hi> in
which sense, he <hi>knows no good,</hi> that <hi>doth no good. These things if
ye know,</hi> (saith our Saviour) <hi>happy are ye if ye do them,</hi> Joh. 13.
17. and in <hi>Deut. 4. 6. Keep the commandments of God, and do
them; for this is your wisdom and understanding before God and
man.</hi>

            <p>What is the <hi>notional sweetness</hi> of <hi>honey,</hi> to the <hi>experimental
taste</hi> of it? It is one thing to know what riches are, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing to be Master of them: it is not the <hi>knowing,</hi> but
the <hi>possessing</hi> of them that <hi>makes rich.</hi> Many have a depth of
knowledge, and yet are not <hi>soul-wise;</hi> have a <hi>Library</hi> of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity</hi>

Insomuch, that in the midst of our so much light, and means
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:99129:6"/>
of Grace, there be few, I fear, that have the sound and saving
knowledge of Jesus Christ, <hi>and him crucified,</hi> which was the

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect. 5.</hi> And that I am not mistaken, the effect shews: For
if men knew either God or Christ, they could not but love
him; and loving him, they would keep his Commandments,
<hi>Joh. 14. 15.</hi> For <hi>hereby</hi> (saith St. <hi>John) it is manifest that we
know him, if we keep his commandments,</hi> 1 Joh. 2. 3. But <hi>he that
saith, I know him, and yet keepeth not his commandments, is a

tells you, <hi>1 Joh. 2. 3.</hi> and so plainly, that you cannot be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
except you desire to deceive your own soul.</p>
            <p>The knowledge of God that saves us, is more then a bare
apprehension of him; it knows his <hi>power,</hi> and therefore <hi>fears</hi>
him; knows his <hi>Justice,</hi> and therefore <hi>serves</hi> him; knows
his <hi>mercy,</hi> and therefore <hi>truis</hi> him; knows his <hi>goodness,</hi> and
therefore <hi>loves</hi> him, &amp;c. For he that hath the saving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of <hi>God,</hi> or of <hi>Christ,</hi> hath every other Grace: there is a
sweet correspondence between <hi>every one,</hi> where there is <hi>any
one</hi> in truth: As in the <hi>generation,</hi> the <hi>head</hi> is not without
the <hi>body,</hi> nor the <hi>body</hi> without each <hi>member,</hi> nor the <hi>soul</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

is <hi>any one</hi> grace in truth, there is <hi>every one,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 17. If you
will see it in particulars, read <hi>Psal. 9. 10. Jer. 9. 24. 1 Joh. 4. 6.
Joh. 4. 10. 1 Joh. 4. 7, 8</hi> &amp; 2. 3. <hi>Job 42. 5, 6.</hi> which Scriptures
shew, that as <hi>feeling</hi> is inseparable to all the <hi>organs of sense,</hi>
the <hi>eye sees and feels,</hi> the <hi>ear hears and feels,</hi> the <hi>pallate tastes
and feels,</hi> the <hi>nostrils smell and feel;</hi> so knowledge is involved
in every grace: Faith <hi>knows and believes,</hi> Charity <hi>knows and

Humility <hi>knows &amp; stoops,</hi> Repentance <hi>knows &amp; mourns,</hi>
Obedience <hi>knows &amp; does,</hi> Confidence <hi>knows &amp; reioyces,</hi> Hope

and <hi>righteousness</hi> again begetteth <hi>knowledge.</hi> It is
between <hi>science</hi> and <hi>conscience,</hi> as it is between the <hi>stomach</hi>

so <hi>science</hi> makes our <hi>conscience good,</hi> &amp; <hi>conscience</hi> makes
our <hi>science good:</hi> Nor is it so much <hi>scientiae capitis,</hi> as <hi>consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entia
cordis,</hi> that knows <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>our selves;</hi> whence <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
saith, <hi>Give thine heart to wisdom,</hi> Prov. 2. 10. and <hi>let wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
enter into thine heart,</hi> Prov. 4. 4. And when he would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
us how to become wise, he tells us, that <hi>the fear of
the Lord is the beginning of wisdom,</hi> Prov. 1. 7. as if the <hi>first
lesson</hi> to be <hi>wise,</hi> were to be <hi>holy.</hi> Again, if it be asked, Why
the <hi>natural man perceiveth not the things of the spirit of God?</hi>
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> answers, he cannot know them, <hi>because they are
spiritually discerned,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 14. and indeed, if they are <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually
discerned,</hi> how should they discern them that have
not the <hi>spirit?</hi> For though the <hi>outward man</hi> receives the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and rudiments of Religion by <hi>breeding</hi> and <hi>education,</hi>
yet his <hi>inward man</hi> receiveth them by <hi>heavenly inspiration,
1 Cor. 2. 11, 12, 13.</hi> &amp; 12. 3, 8. <hi>Mat. 16. 16, 17. Deut. 29. 2. 3, 4.
Psal. 111. 10. Luke 24. 45. John 15. 15.</hi> And this alone is
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:99129:7"/>
enough to prove, that no wicked man is a wise man; for if
<hi>God</hi> alone be <hi>the giver</hi> of it, we may be sure that he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal
his secrets to none but such as he knows will improve
their knowledge to his glory and the good of others: Even
as the <hi>husbandman</hi> will not <hi>cast</hi> his <hi>seed,</hi> but into ground
that will return him a good <hi>harvest, Psal. 25. 14. Luk. 24. 45.
Mark 4. 34. Gen. 18. 17. 1 John 4. 7.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect. 6.</hi> But would there men (any one, even the best of
them) thus improve, or imploy their knowledge? Or do
they desire it to any such end? No: but to some other end,
as I shall in the next place acquaint you.</p>
            <p>Some men desire <hi>not to know,</hi> some desire <hi>onely to know;</hi>
Or rather thus, Few men in comparison desire knowledge,
fewer that desire divine and supernatural knowledge; fewest
of all that desire to be the better, or that others should be
the better for their knowledge: More particularly, a world
of men <hi>desire knowledge</hi> for no other end but <hi>to remove their
ignorance;</hi> as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> used <hi>Moses,</hi> but <hi>to remove the plagues.</hi>
Others again <hi>study</hi> the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and other good <hi>Books,</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to <hi>make gain</hi> thereof; or to be the abler to <hi>dispute</hi> and
<hi>discourse,</hi> as <hi>boys</hi> go into the <hi>water,</hi> only to play and paddle
there, not to <hi>wash</hi> and be <hi>clean.</hi> With <hi>Eve,</hi> they highly desire
the <hi>tree of knowledge,</hi> but regard not the <hi>tree of life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As I would fain know what fruit or effect the knowledge
of most men produces in them, except it be to inable them
to <hi>dispute</hi> and <hi>discourse,</hi> to <hi>increase wit,</hi> or to <hi>increase wealth,</hi>
or to <hi>increase pride,</hi> or perhaps to <hi>increase Athism,</hi> and to
make them the more able and cunning <hi>to argue against the
truth</hi> and power of Religion? Whether the utmost of their
aim be not to <hi>enrich, dignifie,</hi> and <hi>please themselves;</hi> not on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
casting the eye of their souls at <hi>Gods glory,</hi> their <hi>neighbours
good,</hi> or their <hi>own salvation?</hi> Whether their main drift be not
<hi>purchasing of a great estate</hi> for them and theirs, without ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
fear of God, regard of men, or the discharge of their
duty and calling? Again, whereas a <hi>godly man</hi> and a <hi>good
Christian,</hi> thinks himself as happy in <hi>giving light</hi> to others
as in <hi>receiving it</hi> himself; how many are there, who as
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:99129:8"/>
themselves are never the better (I mean in regard of grace)
for their great wisdom and learning, so no more are others;
for commonly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they resemble <hi>dark lanthorns</hi> which <hi>have
light, but so shut up,</hi> and reserved <hi>as if it were not:</hi> and what
is the difference betwixt <hi>concealed skill</hi> and <hi>ignorance?</hi> it is
the <hi>nature and praise of good, to be communicative,</hi> whereas
if their hidden knowledge do ever look out, it casts <hi>so spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
a light,</hi> that it onely argues it self to have <hi>an unprofitable
being.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for the most part these men if they may be thought
<hi>great Rabbies, deep</hi> and <hi>profound Schollars,</hi> this is the height
of their ambition, though neither the <hi>Church be benefited,</hi>
nor <hi>God glorified</hi> by it; whereas they ought the contrary:
for as the <hi>grace of God</hi> is <hi>the fountain</hi> from which our wisdom
<hi>flows,</hi> so the <hi>glory of God</hi> should be the <hi>Ocean</hi> to which it
should <hi>run:</hi> yea, that <hi>God</hi> may be <hi>honoured</hi> with, and by our
<hi>wisdom,</hi> is the only <hi>end</hi> for which he <hi>gives us to be wise:</hi> And
for default of this <hi>end,</hi> he not seldom crosseth the <hi>means</hi>
whereby while men strive to <hi>expel ignorance,</hi> they <hi>fail into er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour;</hi>
as <hi>an Emperick</hi> to <hi>cure one disease, causeth a worse.</hi>
Briefly, to conclude this point, So many as are <hi>puft up with</hi>
their <hi>knowledge,</hi> or do not <hi>part with their sins,</hi> shew that they
never sought it for <hi>Gods glory,</hi> but for their <hi>own honour and
glory.</hi> And certainly if we seek not <hi>Gods glory</hi> in doing his
<hi>work,</hi> he will give us no <hi>wages</hi> at the latter <hi>end.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect. 7.</hi> But for men to do <hi>no good</hi> with their gifts is not all;
yea it were well if that were the <hi>worst,</hi> for not a few of them
resemble <hi>Achitophel</hi> and <hi>Jonadab,</hi> who <hi>employed their wit
wickedly,</hi> and do <hi>mischief instead of good</hi> with their wisdom:
like <hi>Herod,</hi> whom you shall see <hi>turning over the Bible, search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Scriptures, examining the Prophets;</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ut to what end
and purpose? <hi>To know good,</hi> but <hi>to do evil:</hi> yea, the greatest
evil under the Sun, <hi>slay Christ in the cradle:</hi> With many,
their <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>learning</hi> is not <hi>for God</hi> &amp; for <hi>Gideon,</hi> but
<hi>for Antichrist</hi> and <hi>for Babylon:</hi> and so of all other gifts;
how many are the worse for them? As give <hi>Saul a Kingdom,</hi>
and he will <hi>tyrannize;</hi> give <hi>Nabal plenty,</hi> and he will be
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:99129:8"/>
               <hi>drunk;</hi> give <hi>Judas</hi> an <hi>Apostleship,</hi> and he will <hi>sell his Master</hi>
for mony; let <hi>Sermantus</hi> have a <hi>good wit,</hi> he will exercise it
<hi>in scoffing</hi> at <hi>holiness.</hi> Briefly, how oft doth <hi>wisdom</hi> without
<hi>grace</hi> prove like <hi>a fair estate</hi> in the hands of <hi>a fool,</hi> which not
seldom becomes the <hi>owners ruine:</hi> Or <hi>Absoloms hair,</hi> which
was an ornanent, wherewith he <hi>hanged himself:</hi> So that <hi>wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>
without <hi>grace,</hi> is nothing else but a cunning way of <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing
our selves</hi> at the last. Many mens knowledge to them,
being like <hi>the Ark to the Philistims,</hi> which did them <hi>more
hurt than good;</hi> when their knowledge makes them <hi>prouder,</hi>
not <hi>better;</hi> more <hi>rebellious,</hi> not more <hi>serviceable;</hi> as it is,
<hi>Isa. 47. 10. Thy wisdom and thy knowledge they have caused
thee to rebel.</hi> And very often this falls out, that as the <hi>best
soyl</hi> usually yeildeth the <hi>worst air,</hi> so without grace there is
nothing more pestilent than a deep wit, no such prey for
the <hi>Devil,</hi> as a <hi>good wit</hi> unsanctified. Wit and <hi>learning</hi> well
used, is like the <hi>golden ear-rings</hi> and <hi>bracelets</hi> of the <hi>Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi>
abused, like the same <hi>gold</hi> cast into an <hi>Idol;</hi> than which,
nothing more abominable.</p>
            <p>Now when it comes to this, That they fight against <hi>God</hi>
with the <hi>weapon</hi> he hath given them; when with those the
<hi>Psalmist</hi> speaks of, <hi>Psal. 73. 9. They set their mouths against
heaven, and are like an unruly Jade,</hi> that being <hi>full fed kicks
at his Master;</hi> what course doth <hi>the Lord</hi> take with them?

well, he doubled them: but to them that use not their
knowledge well, much more if they abuse it, he <hi>taketh away</hi>
that which he had formerly <hi>given</hi> them: as he took <hi>heat</hi>

them that conjecture, fools: I will turn the wise men back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,

44. 25. <hi>He taketh the wise in their own craftiness, and the

And justly are they forsaken of their reason, who
have abandoned <hi>God;</hi> yea, most just it is, that they who
<hi>want grace,</hi> should <hi>want wit</hi> too. And so much of abusing
their gifts.</p>
            <p>Lastly, These great knowers and wise men are so far from
desiring soul wisdom, and saving knowledge to the ends be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
specified, that they do not at all desire it, for that it suits
not with their condition. For <hi>Natural men</hi> desire only <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi>
and <hi>mundane knowledge: Spiritual men,</hi> that which is
<hi>heavenly</hi> and <hi>supernatural:</hi> and the reason why they <hi>desire
it not,</hi> is, for that they <hi>know it not.</hi> A man <hi>desireth not</hi>
that he <hi>knoweth not,</hi> saies <hi>Chrysostom;</hi> neither are <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known</hi>
evils <hi>feared:</hi> wherefore the work of <hi>Regeneration,</hi>
begins at <hi>Illumination,</hi> Acts 26. 18. <hi>Col. 1. 13. 1 Pet. 2. 9.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now according as men are wise, they prize and value
this wisdom, and endeavour to obtain it, <hi>Prov. 18. 15.</hi> For it
is more true of <hi>divine wisdom,</hi> than it was of that <hi>Grecian
beauty: No man</hi> ever <hi>loved her,</hi> that <hi>never saw her; no man</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<hi>saw her, but he loved her.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And so on the contrary, according as men are ignorant
and blockish, they under-value and dis-esteem it, hate it and
are prejudiced aginst it: And hereupon <hi>carnal men</hi> being
<hi>blinded</hi> by the <hi>Prince of darkness,</hi> together with their own
<hi>wickedness,</hi> and being of a <hi>reprobate judgement,</hi> do most usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
and familiarly term and esteem this <hi>soul-wisdom,</hi> this
divine, spiritual, experimental, and saving-knowledge, to
be meer <hi>foolishness</hi> or <hi>madness,</hi> Wisd. 5. 3. to 9. and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors
thereof to be <hi>fools</hi> and <hi>madmen: Elisha</hi> was counted
no better, <hi>2 Kings 9. 11.</hi> and the rest of the <hi>Prophets,</hi> Hos. 9.
7. &amp; St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Acts 26. 20. and all the <hi>Apostles,</hi> 1 Cor. 4. 10.
Yea, our <hi>Saviour Christ</hi> himself with open mouth was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
<hi>mad</hi> by his <hi>carnal hearers,</hi> Joh. 10. 20. <hi>Mark 3. 21.</hi>
and this hath been the worlds vote ever since. The sincere
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:99129:9"/>
               <hi>Christian</hi> was so reputed in <hi>Pliny</hi>'s time, and after in St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi>'s time: yea, <hi>Julian</hi> the <hi>Pelagian</hi> could give St. <hi>Austin,</hi>
that he had none of the <hi>wise Sages,</hi> nor the <hi>learned Senate
of Philosophers</hi> on his side; but only a company of <hi>mean
Tradesmen,</hi> of the vulgar sort, that took part with him:
whose answer was, <hi>Thou reproachest the weak things of the
world, which God hath chosen to confound the things that are
mighty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To worldly men <hi>Christian wisdom</hi> seems <hi>folly</hi> faith <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi>
And well it may, for even <hi>the wisdom of God is foolishness
with the world,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 18 23. therefore <hi>no disparagement to
us</hi> his servants, if they repute us fools; nor I think <hi>any ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and what it is to be <hi>born a new,</hi> and can give a

and that we are in <hi>favour</hi> with <hi>God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> which many of these
with their <hi>great learning</hi> do not <hi>know.</hi> And thus the <hi>godly</hi> are

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:99129:10"/>
have likewise <hi>the reasons</hi> why these <hi>great knowers, know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi>
yet as they <hi>might</hi> and <hi>ought</hi> to know; that is to say,</p>
            <p>First, Because they are <hi>mistaken</hi> in the thing; they take
<hi>speculative knowledge</hi> for <hi>soul wisdom;</hi> and soul <hi>saving wisdom</hi>
to be <hi>foolishness</hi> and <hi>madness.</hi> Now if a man take his <hi>aim</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss,
he may <hi>shoot</hi> long enough ere he <hi>hit</hi> the <hi>white:</hi> and

but must <hi>come back again</hi> because he hath <hi>mistaken</hi> his <hi>way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Because they are <hi>Vnregenerate,</hi> and want the
<hi>Eye of Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, For that they <hi>seek</hi> not to <hi>God</hi> for it who is the <hi>gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi>
thereof, &amp; without whose <hi>spirit</hi> there is no attaining it.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Because they are <hi>proud,</hi> and so seek not after
it, as <hi>supposing</hi> they <hi>have it</hi> already.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Because if they <hi>had</hi> never so <hi>much</hi> knowledge,
they would be <hi>never the</hi> holier, or the <hi>better</hi> for it, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the <hi>worse;</hi> nor would they imploy it to the <hi>honour of

            </p>
            <p>Sixthly, Because they either <hi>do,</hi> or would <hi>do mischief</hi> in

            <p>Seventhly, Because they will not consult with the <hi>word</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> thus, They <hi>read</hi> and <hi>hear</hi> the Scriptures and mind
not, (I mean the spirituality <hi>of the word)</hi> or <hi>mind</hi> and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
not, or <hi>understand</hi> and remember not, or <hi>remember</hi> and
<hi>practise</hi> not. No, this they intend not of all the rest; and they
that are unwilling to <hi>obey, God</hi> thinks <hi>unworthy</hi> to <hi>know.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the <hi>Serpent</hi> taught knowledge, he said, <hi>If ye eat

            <p>If you would know how to call them, they are properly

though they be <hi>wise to do evil:</hi> Or if you will, <hi>wise in goods,</hi>
not <hi>wise in grace:</hi> For as that old <hi>Serpent</hi> seemed to boast,

compare them, then to <hi>Bats, Night-crows Owls,</hi> and <hi>Cats,</hi>

how, comes rather <hi>out of the abundance of the heart,</hi> than by extreme

When <hi>Christ taught in the Temple, they asked, How knoweth this man the

some men have, that have <hi>no learning!</hi> Like <hi>Prisilla</hi> and <hi>Aquila,</hi> poor
<hi>Tent-makers,</hi> who were able to <hi>school Apollos</hi> that great Clerk, a man <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned</hi>
for his <hi>learning:</hi> What can we say to it? For no other reason can
be given, but as <hi>Christ</hi> said, <hi>Father, so it pleaseth thee:</hi> For as <hi>Jacob</hi> said
of his <hi>Venison,</hi> when his <hi>Father</hi> asked how he came by it so <hi>suddenly?
Because the Lord thy God brought it suddenly to my hands.</hi> So holy &amp; righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
men do more easily understand the words of God, than do the
wicked, because God brings the meaning suddenly to their hearts, as
we read, <hi>Luk. 24.</hi> That <hi>Christ (standing in the midst of his Apostles after he
was risen from the dead) opened their understandings, that they might under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
clearly the Scriptures, and what was written of him in the Law of Moses,
and in the Prophets, and in the Psalms,</hi> ver. 44. 45. Lo how suddenly their

words unto you,</hi> vers. 23. And <hi>Psal. 25. The secrets of the Lord are revealed to
them that fear him, and his covenant is to give them understanding,</hi> ver. 14.
These <hi>secrets</hi> are <hi>hid</hi> from the wicked, neither hath he made any such
covenant with them, but the contrary: As see, <hi>Dan. 12. 10. Vnto you
it is given to know the secrets of the Kingdom of Heaven, but to others in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables,

            <p>Again, It is not enough to <hi>pray,</hi> except also it be <hi>in Christs name,</hi> and
<hi>according to his will, believing to be heard for his sake,</hi> and that it be the
<hi>intercession of Gods own spirit</hi> in you: And (being truly sensible of your
<hi>sins</hi> and <hi>wants)</hi> that you chiefly pray for the <hi>pardon of sin,</hi> the <hi>effusion of
