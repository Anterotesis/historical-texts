            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE
To the Reader.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is an observation as
true as antient, that
such workes of God as
are done immediatly by
himselfe alone, though
for their excellent greatnesse farre sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passing
not onely mans apprehension, but
even admiration it selfe, yet are done by
him without any rubbe or difficulty at
all. Such was that glorious and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficall
worke of Creation. But such
workes as God doth by instrumentall
meanes, as by man, the greater they be,
the greater difficulties they are attended
with, and meet with many impediments.
And this is most seene in great and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall


<pb facs="tcp:8160:3"/>
Reformations of Churches or
States. Even Christ himselfe, The
<hi>onely Potentate,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 15. 16.</note> the <hi>Mighty God,</hi>
when hee came to restore and re-erect
the Tabernacle of <hi>David,</hi> which was
fallen downe, to wit, his spirituall Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
or Church, what opposition did hee
meet withall? what sweat did it cost him,
before hee could finish this glorious and
wondrous worke? In which respect the
Antients were wont to say, That God
with his word alone created the world;
but it cost the life of his onely begotten
sonne to redeeme the world for this was
opposed by Devills and men. And so it
was with the type of Redemption, Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raels
deliverance from Egypt, where
Gods mighty wonders and plagues upon
Egypt, found a proud and hard hearted
<hi>Pharaoh,</hi> with his blinde Egyptians ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinately
resisting to the very last. So in
the reparation of the Temple in Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,
there wanted not most malignant
spirits,<note place="margin">Ezra 5. 6.</note> envious men, is <hi>Tatnai, Shether
Boznai,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Nehem. 4.</note> 
               <hi>Tobiah,</hi> and <hi>Sanballat,</hi> who


<pb facs="tcp:8160:3"/>
mocked and accused the Iewes to the
King, and by force sought to hinder the
worke. And therefore can wee wonder,
when in the proceeding of so great a
worke of reformation as we see begun in
our dayes (nothing inferior (all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
considered) to that deliverance
from Egypt, or to the restauration of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
after Babylons captivity) difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and impediments both great and
many have and doe interpose them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves?
which when wee see wee should
not be discouraged;<note place="margin">Cum reflavit affligimur. <hi>Cic.</hi>
               </note> for discouragement
in such cases is an argument and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
of a mind too much relying upon
outward meanes, which while they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper,
they are as a good gale filling the
sayles of our hope to attaine the wished
Port. But when an adverse winde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
but to whistle a little up, we are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted,
and are ready to cast away our
hope, being left as a ship without an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor
floating, and without a rudder dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
with every winde, ready to bee split
on every rocke or shelfe. But in such a


<pb facs="tcp:8160:4"/>
case, we must, as in the first place look up
unto God the great master of the winds,
yea and mover of the mindes of the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
men: So herein behold and observe
the beaten wayes of the Lord, how hee is
pleased in all such great works to suffer
himselfe and his people to bee opposed.
And this he doth for speciall reasons, as
to shew forth the deepe wisdome of his
providence, in circumventing his adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries,
to crosse and thwart them even
in those great and good workes which
himselfe will have to be done, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
purposeth to accomplish, &amp; which
he calleth them unto, and commandeth
them to doe, that so he may take them off
from trusting in the outward meanes,
though never so faire, and might teach
them still and stedfastly to trust in his
helpe, in his strength, in his faithfulnes,
and not to cease to call upon him and de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pend
on his promise, who will certainely
save, and fully answer the prayers of his
people, and in the happy issue of the work,
that his glory may in all shine forth the


<pb facs="tcp:8160:4"/>
more clearely, when nothing shall be left
in man to glory in, but that we may
give all the honour and praise of the
worke to him alone.</p>
            <p>Againe, in all such great workes of
generall Reformation, especially of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
the difficulties prove to be the
greater, by how much the vices and
corruptions to be purged out (as we see
in naturall bodies) are and have been of
longer continuance, and such also as
have received strength (under pretence
at least) even from the Lawes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and by universall consent of the
whole State. Nor only this, but there is
also in our natures a kinde of Antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
against that purity and power of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
which ought to be the maine end
that all true Reformations should aime
at. And besides all this, although the
corruptions be so grosse, and of so high a
nature, as they proclaime themselves
intollerable grievances, no longer to bee
borne, but doe by a kinde of necessity
presse to a Reformation: yet there


<pb facs="tcp:8160:5"/>
stands so great a gulfe in the way, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
it be removed, or so made up, as to be
made passable, it will be found no easie
matter to compasse so great a worke.
Now this gulfe is ignorance, and that
of a long standing, contracted partly
through a generall security and sloth,
and partly through the want of meanes,
while through the subtilty of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates,
and cowardise of their inferiors,
the Light hath been put under a Bushel.
So as though the sense of our Aegyptian
burthens hath at length let us see in a
great measure our misery, yea, and
though God in his great mercy hath put
into our hands such an opportunity of
Reformation, even armed with a kinde
of necessity to worke it: Yet how unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
are many men of the manner and
measure of this Reformation, and what
God requires at our hands herein? Yet
can we not be otherwise perswaded, but
that all good men would joyne together,
quickly to goe through with this great
worke, did they but apprehend it to bee


<pb facs="tcp:8160:5"/>
as well a matter of Conscience, as of grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance.
For which cause, I have in
these straits of time, thought it one part
of my duty which I owe unto Christ, and
to his Church, to propound, and briefly
to resolve (as God hath enabled me)
some important Cases of Conscience,
which (hoping they may conduce to the
furthering of the great businesse now in
agitation concerning Religion) I have
adventured most humbly to recommend
unto the serious consideration of this
most just, sage and grave Senate, as to
which not only I, but all the people of
the Land doe owe our best service, and
for whose happy successe of all their
grave Counsels, we are all bound daily,
and that in a more than ordinary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
to solicite (as we still doe) the throne
of Grace, that the Spirit of Christ may
be abundantly poured forth upon this
most Noble Assembly, in all wisdome,
and understanding, and in all judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
zeale, courage, constancy, unity,
unamity in the love of the Truth, that


<pb facs="tcp:8160:6"/>
such a perfect Reformation may be
wrought as Christ at this time calleth
for, as his word appointeth, as all Gods
people every where thirst after, and as
the whole Antichristian faction is afraid
of, that so, when Christ alone shall be set
upon his Throne over our soules, to rule
us according to his word, and to dwell
among us by his Spirit, the Kings throne
may be for ever established in justice
and judgement, and Gods people in this
Land may enjoy both inward and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
peace unto the day of Christ, and
so our posterity after us may blesse God,
and for ever call this Parliament, <hi>The
blessed Parliament.</hi>

               <p>THe answer is negative, They

               <p>First, Because the Scripture
knoweth no such creatures as Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesan

than Presbyters, whereof one or

                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:8160:8"/>
1. 1. So as Presbyters &amp; Bishops
in Scripture are convertible termes;
every Presbyter a Bishop, and every
Bishop a Presbyter.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Because all such prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall
jurisdiction and domination
as our Diocesans usurpe and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise,
is expresly forbidden by Christ
himselfe, as <hi>Mat. 20, 25, 26. Mark. 10.
42, 43. Luke</hi> 22. 25, 26.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Because the Apostles
condemned all such jurisdiction and
domination as our Prelats use: As
2 <hi>Cor. 1. 24. 2 Cor. 11. 20. 2 Thess. 2. 4.
1 Pet. 5. 3. 3 Joh.</hi> 9. 10.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Because Apostles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
whose successors Prelats pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to be, never used any such juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
as the Prelats doe, neither in
Ordination of Ministers, nor in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication,
(both which they
doe most grosly abuse) nor in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of Canons, or setting up or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
of Ceremonies, both of meer
humane invention, which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles

               <p>Fiftly, Because the Prelats are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
able to prove by any demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from Scripture, that their juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
is of Divine authority: their
allegations are meere pervertings of
scripture;<note place="margin">So D. <hi>Hall</hi> in his Booke of Episcopacie.</note> as they alledge first, Christs
ordaining twelve Apostles, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty
Disciples; here was an ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality (say they) <hi>Ergo</hi> a superiority
of jurisdiction. But neither can hee
prove here any such authority, as
they pretend, or much lesse any sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination
of the seventy, unto the
Twelve; for the Twelve neither or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
nor sent forth the Seventy.
Secondly, they alledge the post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scripts
after the second Epistle to <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy;</hi>
and after that to <hi>Titus;</hi> which
say, That those two were Bishops.
But 'tis cleare, that those postscripts
are no part of the Text, as <hi>Beza</hi> well
sheweth. Nor are they to be found
in the vulgar Latine translation,


<pb n="4" facs="tcp:8160:9"/>
which was at the least an hundred
yeares after Christ. <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
were both Evangelists, not resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
any where, but as the Apostles
called them from Country to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
as we read in <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles: and
if they were to bee called Bishops,
according to the scripture, they must
have beene Bishops over one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
respectively. Thirdly,
they aledge those seven Angels, 1 <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
2 &amp;</hi> 3. These (say they) were se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Bishops. This they can never
prove. And if Bishops, yet Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sans
they were not, seeing for some
hundreds of yeares after, there were
no such Diocesse extant. And our
last Translation, in the contents of
the second Chapter of the <hi>Revelation</hi>
calls those Angels the Ministers of
those Churches. And for the Angel
to be meant of one single man, doth
imply many absurdities, as that God
should destroy a whole Church for
one mans sake: for God threatneth


<pb n="5" facs="tcp:8160:9"/>
the Angell of Ephesus, if hee repent
not, to remove his Candlesticke out
of his place; to wit, that whole
Church. But God never doth
so; there is not in all the whole
scripture any one example, that God
ever rooted out a whole State or
Church, generall or particular, for
one mans sinne, be he Magistrate or
Governor. And if God for one pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Prelates sin, should remove
or destroy a whole Church, as that
of Ephesus; as there he threatens the
Angell, who alone is charged with
one onely sinne, which was a decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
from his first love: Then
what security or safety can the
whole Church or State of England
long promise to it selfe, so long as it
harboreth in the bosome and bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els
thereof such a crew and confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy
of most notorious and apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statised
Prelates, who have not now
declined in some degrees from the
faith formerly professed, but have


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:8160:10"/>
openly oppressed and persecuted the
Preachers and preaching of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
and that even unto bloud? And
againe, to goe about to proove the
lawfulnesse of Prelacy by the Word
of God, from a word of a darke and
figurative signification, against cleer
and expresse testimonies of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to the contrary, is most absurd
and too presumptuous. For, for An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell
here to signifie a Prelate, cannot
possibly, because the Scripture else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
(as before) damneth all Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy
in the Church of Christ. And
there be many other reasons to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute
them, that these Angells were
no such Bishops, other than Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Bishops, as aforesaid: and that
which was spoken to one, was by a
Senechdochae spoken to all, as is usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in Scripture, and cleare in all
those seven Epistles.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, The wisest and learnedest
of the Prelats at this day among us,
doe warily decline the Scripture in


<pb n="7" facs="tcp:8160:10"/>
this point, &amp; dare not stand to their
authority, as being point blanke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them: but they fly to Custom
and antiquity, as the Papists doe for
all their unwritten Traditions.</p>

               <p>THe Answer is negative: first,
because it is not a sufficient
warrant to build the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

to have been Diocesan Bishops,

or to have had or exercised such a

Thirdly, could that be proved, yet

already worke, &amp;c.</hi> which mysterie
was, that of Prelacy, as appeares
clearely from that Text, where the
Man of sin who exalts himself over
the Church, is set forth as the head

the Hierarchy, which is and hath
been the <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

And <hi>Jerome</hi> who lived in the

was first devised for a remedy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

                  <hi>If it were lawfull for a

all, but reduced that antient abuse
among the Iewes, to the primitive
institution of God in Paradise.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The matter in hand is
of higher moment, than to be regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated

               <p>FOr resolution whereof wee are

in the Old Testament all must bee

               <p>FOr answer hereunto, First in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/>
generall, there is no need at all
of any such Officers in the
Church as are not of any divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,
as Prelats are not, as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said:
yea, such officers, in stead of
any profitable usefulnesse, are most
unprofitable and pernicious: as the
Lord saith to false Prophets,<note place="margin">Ier. 23. 32.</note> 
                  <hi>I have


<pb n="17" facs="tcp:8160:15"/>
not sent them, therfore they shall not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
this people at all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly and particularly, First,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/>
Prelates are no way requisite or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
for ordaining of Ministers:
First, because they ordaine rather a
new order of Priests, than true Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters;
for which cause the Booke
of Ordination calls them Priests:
whereas true Ministers are never
called in the new Testament priests.
Secondly, They ordaine no true Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
of the Gospell (if wee may
beleeve their practise) but rather a
sort of dumbe Priests: for when
they have ordained a full Minister,
(as they call it) having put the Bible
into his hand, saying, <hi>Take thou au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
to preach the Word of God;</hi> yet
for all this hee may not; must not
preach at all, till he have obtained
the Prelates License, which he must
purchase for a good fee. Again, they
make such Priests as are dumb dogs
and cannot barke, being meere Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noramuses


<pb n="18" facs="tcp:8160:16"/>
and Sir <hi>John-Lacke-La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines;</hi>
abusing those words, <hi>Receive
thou the holy Ghost:</hi> And, <hi>Take thou au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
to preach the Word of God.</hi> And
lastly, They make no true Ministers
of Christ, seeing they bind all with
the Oath of Canonicall obedience,
to be subject to their lawlesse laws,
in the execution of their Ministry.</p>
               <p>Secondly, There is no use nor
need of Prelates for inflicting of
Censures. Their power &amp; practise
of Excommunication is altogether
unlawfull, a meere usurpation, and
contrary to Gods Ordinance; and
that in many respects. First, because
the Prelate is not the Pastor of that
Congregation whose member is
cut off by Excommunication. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Prelate doth it alone, hee
or his Surrogate; and this perhaps
either a Lay-man, or a dumb priest,
without any consent of the people.
Thirdly, he excommunicates a man
for every triviall cause, &amp; that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out


<pb n="19" facs="tcp:8160:16"/>
due summons, &amp; rashly, and for
his fee absolves him without any
repentance or reformation, &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
satisfaction to the people offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
Whereas exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication is the
highest censure, &amp; is to be done by
the Minister &amp; congregation joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<note place="margin">Mat. 18. 17. &amp; 1 Cor. 5.</note>
after much means used to reclaim
the offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dor, &amp; for grievous scandals;
&amp; not to be restored without hearty
repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tance, in a sad, serious &amp; solemn
maner. Lastly, if Prelats for the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
here alledged be of no use for the
high censure of excommunication,
how much lesse need is there of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
for inflicting corporall or criminall
punishment upon reputed Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents,
as deprivation of liberty by
imprisonme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, of the ministry by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation,
degradation, suspe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sion, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation
of means and livelihood,
by imposing of intolerable fines,
and restraining men from the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of their particular Calling, to the
undoing of them and theirs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:8160:17"/>
Thirdly, for calling of Synods,
cannot this bee without a Prelate?
may not this be by a Law dormant,
giving liberty when occasion shall
be, to have a Synod, for the better
ordering whereof, a Moderator for
the time being is by votes elected?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, For determining of
doubts arising in matters of Faith,
what need is there for Prelats? Are
they fit or competent Iudges in such
things? Yea, are they not herein e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregious
usurpers, presumptuous
and arrogant men? Yea Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christs,
in sitting thus in the Temple
of God, over mens consciences, as
Lords over mens faith? Is not this a
meere evacuating of the authoritie
and sufficiencie of the Scripture,
which is the sole judge and rule of
Faith? Yet this Prelates presume to
doe, and challenge as their proper
right: so as in the twentieth Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
which is of the Authority of the
Church, these words have beene of


<pb n="21" facs="tcp:8160:17"/>
later dayes foisted in, namely, that
the Church hath authority in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies
of faith.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, Neither in appointing of
Ceremonies are Prelates needfull:
Yea, for prelates or Church, or any
humane power to ordaine and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
Ceremonies to binde the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
in the worship of God, this
is expressely condemned and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
both by Christ himselfe,<note place="margin">Mat. 15. 9.</note> and
by the Prophets,<note place="margin">Ecc. 29. 13.</note> and by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles.<note place="margin">Col. 2. 8. 18.</note>
Man may not impose the least
Ceremony in Gods worship: if hee
doe, he therein denies Christ, <hi>Col. 2.
19.</hi> he holds not the Head. And yet
the aforesaid Article boldly affirmes
saying, The Church hath power to
decree Rites and Ceremonies. So as
this Article, whether meaning by
Church the Prelates (as they meane
it) or any other humane power,
ought to be to Christians no article
of Faith, or binding any mans Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:8160:18"/>
Sixtly, For orders sake: for what
order-sake are Prelates necessary, or
any way requisit? what order they
keep all men know: &amp; what order
can there be in a Babylonish gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as the prelatical altogether is?</p>
               <p>7. For confirmation of children:
This also is a Babylonish Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t;
as if it did confer some grace <hi>ex opere
operato,</hi> or some vertue dropping out
of the Bishops Lawn sleeve. Indeed
this confirmation is a pretty knack
to win credit to the Prelacy fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the
blinde Vulgar, which to everie wel
taught Christian is both superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and ridiculous.</p>
               <p>8 For dedication of Churches; this
is a most notorious Romish, Popish
superstition, &amp; is rather a meer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanation,
than any dedication, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
it be to superstition &amp; idolatry,

adorations, &amp; the like, which
they use in their dedication, there
goes forth a vertue, by which holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
is infused into the wals &amp; pews,
especially into their sacred chancel.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, for the form of Liturgy, if
we goe no farther than our Service
booke, which is an extract out of
Romes Latine service, Missall, or
Masse-booke, as it is confessed in
the Booke of Martyrs,<note place="margin">Vol. 2. p. 667. print. ed. 1631</note> the Romane
Latine being turned into English: if
there were no more in it than this,
that it is the forme of Romes Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and so (as King <hi>Iames</hi> once cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

a little startle such Christians, as
hold that Christianity to be the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,
which hath least conformitie

For if wee be commanded to come

conscience be present at the English
Liturgy, which is for the maine, the
Masse turned into English. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it be objected, that it is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
from the Popish drosse, yet if
it should be brought to the Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone,
or tried in the Text, let the
wisest then judge how free from
Popish drosse it is, when therein
they shall finde Romish superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Ceremonies maintained and
prest upon mens consciences, as the
Surplice, Crosse in Baptisme, knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
at the Sacrament, standing at
the Creed, attended with their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
significations, as if man had a
power to set up any significant Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
in Gods worship,<note place="margin">Gal. 4. 9, 10.</note> when
as wee finde all kinde of signes and
ceremonies in Gods service under
the Old Testament,<note place="margin">Col. 2. 16.</note> though ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by God himselfe, to be utterly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolished
by Christ, and forbidden
to Christians under the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
and much more all such as


<pb n="25" facs="tcp:8160:19"/>
are of humane invention: all which
are of that nature,<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 1.</note> as the Apostle cals
them, the <hi>Yoke of Bondage,</hi> to such as
are intangled therein; exhorting all
Christians to stand fast in the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
wherewith Christ hath made us
free. And <hi>Col.</hi> 2. he plainly shewes
all such ordinances to be an evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Christs death, and so an apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacie
from Christ. And no Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
I hope, will plead for the use of
humane ordinances in Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
when Christ hath abrogated
all ceremonies of divine institution,
and hath left no footstep for any
one Ceremonie in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and flatly condemns all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements
of men in Gods Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice:
It beeing also a strange pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
for any man to think, that
either he hath authority to prescribe
how God should bee worshipped,
or that God should be pleased with
any such will-worship; when in
stead of being pleased, hee saith, <hi>In


<pb n="26" facs="tcp:8160:20"/>
vain they worship me, teaching for Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
the Comments of men.</hi> For sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with vaine worship God is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
pleased nor honoured.</p>
               <p>Againe, seeing we are here fallen
upon the consideration or exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of the Service booke, let all
wise hearted and well instructed
schollers in Christs schoole, that
have learned the art of separating
the pretious from the vile: but tell
me what they think of Apocryphall
bookes, publiquely read in Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
as if they were the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures?
What of the whole Letanie,
so stuffed with Tautologies or vain
repetitions? What of the prayer in
the Letanie and of the Collect,
wherein Bishops or Prelates are
prayed for, being Antichristian and
false Bishops; and all other Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
are prayed for, as being the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
of those Bishops: than which
what can be a greater reproach and
shame to the Ministers of the


<pb n="27" facs="tcp:8160:20"/>
Church of England? What of so
many carvings of Scriptures into E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles
and Gospels, with their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Collects, for the maintenance
and celebration of Saints days, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Holydayes? What of the lame
and incongruous, yea senseles trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
of those sundry Scriptures
with the Psalmes? What of prayers
at the buriall of the Dead? What of
Churching of women, <hi>aliâs,</hi> Their
Purification, as some call it, and
which answers to that under the
Law? What of Priestly absolution?
with many more particulars, too
long here to rehearse. And in a
word, What of so many prayers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
to be read, enough to blunt
the edge of any true devotion, and
so to tyre out the strongest sided Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister,
as hee hath neither strength
nor time left for Gods Ordinance,
namely the preaching of the Word.
And (to say the very truth) this kind
of long Service was devised by the


<pb n="28" facs="tcp:8160:21"/>
Popes successively, to that very end,
namely to entertaine the people
with a blinde devotion, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
them in ignorance, when
now no roome was left for preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
which was by this meanes
thrust by the head and sholders out
of their Churches. And thus what
a deale of pretious time is taken up
with a long, dull, and dead forme of
prayer, which might and ought to
be spent to edification of Gods
people on the Lords owne Day,
which should be sanctified not in
humane devises, but in Gods owne
Ordinances, to the glory of Him
who is the Lord of the day. I say a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
(for I speake nothing defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively,
as passing myne own private
judgement of these things) let this
wise and grave Senate (now assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled

primarily in the matters of God
and of Christ, maturely judge.</p>

               <head type="sub">Whether any set forme of a Liturgie
or publique Prayer be necessarie to bee
used in the publique Worship of God?</head>
               <p>FOr answer: Indeed if it bee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to have unpreaching
Ministers, and dumb dogs over
the people of the Lord, who can nor
preach nor pray, then it will bee no
lesse necessary to have some form of
Booke prayers or Liturgy for such
to officiate by. And for this cause
the Prelates have had some reason
to hold up their Liturgy to the full,
as without which there had beene
nothing for their Mutes to do in the
Church. Now though dumbe
Priests have need of such a Liturgy,
yet it doth not follow, that therfore
able godly Ministers, that know


<pb n="30" facs="tcp:8160:22"/>
how to fit their prayers to all such
severall occasions as do continually
present themselves (which a set
prayer in a booke cannot do) should
be tied to any such precise set forme.
For otherwise,<note place="margin">1 Thess. 5.</note> this were to quench
the spirit of prayer, and to muzzle
the mouth of prayer, and to stoppe
the course of Gods spirit, which
doth wonderfully improve it self in
all those both Ministers and people,
on whom God hath powred the
spirit of grace and supplication, and
who do by daily exercise grow un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
such a habit of prayer, and which
doth powre it selfe forth in such a
life and power, as is not possible for
any set read prayer to exercise or
have. For true, fervent, effectuall
prayer is that which is the hearts
expression by the Spirit of God. As
the Apostle saith,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 15</note> 
                  <hi>I will pray with my
Spirit.</hi> and <hi>(Phil. 19.) Prayer is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
by the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</hi> This
is that prayer which is first in the


<pb n="31" facs="tcp:8160:22"/>
heart, before it come to the mouth,
and is dictated by Gods spirit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it be uttered with the lippes:
whereas a read prayer is in the
mouth before it can come unto the
heart, which in prayer is a speaking
unadvifedly with the lips, before
the heart hath first digested and sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested
the matter. This is an abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
birth which never had a right
conception, But a godly Minister
that is best acquainted with the
state of his flocke, and of the church
of God, can accordingly so inlarge
and apply his prayer, by the supply
of Gods spirit, as may be most use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to the Congregation, as beeing
most occmmodate to their spirits,
when they finde the matter of the
prayer to be that, the want whereof
they are most sencible of: so as there
is here a concurrence of the spirits
both of the Minister and people,
which causeth a prayer to bee so
much the more effectuall, lively,


<pb n="32" facs="tcp:8160:23"/>
powerfull, and operative, and that
not onely with God, but in the
hearts of all those whose joint prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
it is. Whereas a read prayer is in
comparison, a dead and dull formal
prayer, without any life or power
either to prevaile with God, or to
profit the people: as beeing such a
prayer as suits only such Readers as
are destitute of the spirit of Grace,
and supplication, and of faith and
sanctification, and therefore such as
God regardeth not. So as a true Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
of Christ ought not to be tyed
with the bonds and lines of a writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
forme of prayer that must bee
read, forasmuch as hereby the spirit
of prayer in him is bound up, and
both he and the people of God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
both of the benefit of such a
gift, and of that profit also which
the prevailing prayer of Christs spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
procures of God. Yea, not even a
set written prayer which the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
makes, &amp; saith by heart, though


<pb n="33" facs="tcp:8160:23"/>
he reade it not, and though it bee
better to say it by heart, than to read
it out of a booke, yet is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or can be so
lively and powerfull as that prayer
which is not tied to a set forme of
words. From such a prayer as is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
by heart (as we say) the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
is more exercised, than the
understanding and affections with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
him; there beeing now a suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of that worke of the spirit of
supplication and grace, which brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theth
forth with a lively power in
a conceived prayer, wherein not the
memory so much, as the whole
mind, soule, spirit, &amp; affections, have
their joint operation.</p>
               <p>But it may be objected, That the
Reformed Protestant Churches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the seas have their set formes
of publique prayer and sacraments
'Ts true: but I take it that the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
are not tied to those forms, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than they will themselves. As
we see the Ministers of the Kirke of


<pb n="34" facs="tcp:8160:24"/>
Scotland now in England, use no
set formes of prayer, but doe dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
the duty of prayer with an
excellent freedome of spirit, &amp; with
such an apt accommodation thereof
to the present condition of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
and of the state of Gods church,
as that it serves greatly to the edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
and raising up of the spirits
of Gods people sympathising with
it, and is first (of all other kindes of
prayer) to speed with the Prayer-hearing
God, who best knowes the
meaning and language of that spirit
of his, by which such prayers are
poured forth. And surely were this
well exercised by our Ministers in
England, in publique, as I know it
is by many both Ministers &amp; peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in private, it would no doubt
much facilitate and hasten the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment
of that great worke
of a thorow-reformation, so happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
begun, and hopefully proceeded
in, if flesh and bloud bee not too


<pb n="35" facs="tcp:8160:24"/>
much consulted with, and humane
policy (which should have no hand
in setting out or authorising any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised
forme of Gods worship, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
on the conscience) too much
relied upon.</p>

to build a new house in the

of the old.</p>
               <p>This indeed stands with good

as a preparation of the materialls to

small a matter to alienate the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
of a name or title from the
right owners, to whom alone God
hath made it peculiar and proper:
For such an alienation is an alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
not onely of the true property of
the name, but also of the nature of
that office to which it was first gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
of God. For (as is shewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
the name of Bishop is proper
<hi>quarto modo,</hi> to every Pastor over that
Congregation to which hee is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
called: and the name <hi>Episcopus,</hi>
or in English, Bishop or Over-seer,
sets forth the office of such a Pastor
over his flocke. So as to take away
this name from the Pastor, and to
appropriate it to one single man set
over other Ministers, to wit, one
that is by man stiled and denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

yet when the title of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop

none. And if of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors,
some onely be called Bishops,
and the rest not, here also Christs
sheepehooke is wrung out of his

                  <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 25.</note> So easie
a thing it is by the alienation or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriation
of a name, to set up such


<pb n="43" facs="tcp:8160:28"/>
an office and government in the
Church, as wherby Christs govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
&amp; the proper office of his true
Ministers, are cast to the ground &amp;
trampled under foot.</p>
               <p>Moreover, if ever this governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Bishops, falsly so called,
shall bee set up or continued in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
aforesaid, yet farre bee it from
those Worthies of the land, whose
justice is so cleare and unpartiall in
other things, and namely in the cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
off of all Monopolies in the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
State, to erect or ratifie, or any
way to countenance such a Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poly
in Christs kingdome, so dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory
to his incommunicable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative,
and to that stile and office
wherein he hath so highly dignified
and intrusted all faithful Ministers.
For what a Monopoly is this, to
take away the title wherein the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of all true Pastors is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended,
and to transfer it to one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone

               <p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:8160:29"/>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> But here it may be objected,
That the Reformed Churches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the seas, as even Geneva it selfe,
have their Overseers, which is a title
and office equivalent to our Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>san
Bishops, <hi>Episcopus</hi> signifying an
Overseer: why then is it not as law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to have the like in England?</p>
               <p>I answer: The case is farre diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent;
for such Overseers or Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
as in other reformed Churches
they are called (as in the Kirke of
Scotland) are chosen by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
and Elders, and that but for
one yeare, and whose office is to call
the Synods at certaine fixed times,
and to collect the votes, &amp; the like.
But some say, that our usurping Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
shall bee perpetuall for their
lives; and how farre the power of
their place and dignity may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
especially when they have
their election from the Court, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
immediate and absolute <hi>per se,</hi>
or by the means of a <hi>Conge de lier,</hi> as


<pb n="45" facs="tcp:8160:29"/>
whom so designed above, the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of the Diocesse (in stead of the
Deane and Chapter) are bound to
elect. Or if they be but Triennial, &amp;
so to come under the visitation of a
Trienniall Parliament; yet who
knows but such spirits may so work
as in time to make Parliaments as
geason as heretofore? when some
of them have confessed, that they
never dreamed to see a Parliament
againe. Or if they shall be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from three yeare to three yeare,
yet this is also more than is used in
forreine Reformed Churches<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And
however, for them to retaine the
name of Bishop still (as before) is
against Gods Word, and not onely
derogatory to Christs true Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
for the present, but also very
prejudiciall to their liberty, when
such Bishops holding their favor in
Court, and their neerenesse to the
Chaire of State, may by that means
grow awfull to those their Curates,


<pb n="46" facs="tcp:8160:30"/>
among whom some, and perhaps
too many, may be found ready to
prostitute their officiousnesse unto
their Bishop, in stead of Christ, out
of a hope to be made the heires ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant
of the Bishopricke; which
though it be now cropt and deplu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
yet will be still a bait for am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,
which must be doing, and
will rather play small game than sit
out. All which considered, I leave it
to the Wise to judge what may bee
the consequents thereof, &amp; whether
by this means either we or our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
may come to see as great cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
both in doctrine and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
as now we doe. For (as I sayd
before) the time may come, when
God in his justice may deny this
State the like opportunity (so armed
with a necessity of reformation, as
we neither could have wished, nor
any more can hope for) to reforme
Episcopall insolencie. Or suppose a
possibility of Prelates to become no


<pb n="47" facs="tcp:8160:30"/>
worse than as the Parliament shall
leave them, yet the least rag of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacie
making a rent in Christs coat,
(as it beeing the head of such a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
as is condemned by the
Word of God) ought no more to be
pieced to Christs livery, seeing it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyeth
Christian liberty, both in
Ministers and people. And all this
(I say) ariseth from the very name
of Bishop so misplaced; for which
cause it ought to be with the whole
Bishopricke utterly extirped; and
that no lesse, than the heathen Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
rooted out the very name of
the <hi>Tarquins,</hi> for the tiranny which
they had exercised.</p>

               <p>I Answer: First, That these 39 ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
taken <hi>conjunctim</hi> together,
no man can with a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
rightly informed, subscribe
unto them. For secondly, There be
some of those articles which are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
false; as Article 20, which saith,
<hi>The Church hath power to decree Rites
and Ceremonies, and authority in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies
of faith.</hi> Both which are
false (as before is noted) and were
added since the same article was
first made in King <hi>Edward</hi> the sixt


<pb n="49" facs="tcp:8160:31"/>
his dayes. Againe the 36 Article is
no lesse false, which saith, <hi>The booke
of ordination of Archbishops and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops;
and ordering of Priests, &amp;c. doth
containe all things necessary to such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration
and ordering. Neither hath it
anything that of it selfe is superstious
and ungodly. And therefore all so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated
and ordered according to the
Rites prescribed, &amp;c. wee decree to bee
rightly orderly, and lawfully consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and ordered.</hi> Now to this article
all Ministers subscribe, although
they be false Bishops consecrated af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the order of Rome; and false
Priests that are by false bishops so
ordered.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Art. 3. it is sayd, <hi>As Christ
died for us, and was buried; so is it to
be beleeved that he went down into hell.</hi>
Which going downe into hell, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
a locall going downe into the

the truth of Scripture, and the
current of all sound interpreters, and
therefore not to bee beleeved as
Christs death and buriall.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, some Articles are made
of late by the enemies of grace, the
Prelates, of so doubtfull and double
a sence (as those especially about
Grace and Freewill) that they have
procured a Declaration prefixed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Articles, in the Kings name,
prohibiting the free preaching of
those points according to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
So as Ministers canot resolve
what it is they subscribe unto in the

yoke in the Prelacy, with the
burthen of all their Rites and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
removed from Christians neckes:
what is that particular form of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which is to be set up?</head>
               <p>FOr answer: First we premised
something hereof in generall,
namely, That Christs governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
alone is to be set up in all true
Christian congregations, and so his
yoke to be borne, as our glory, upon
our neckes. But secondly, for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and a more particular unfold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of this government of Christ
over every true Church or congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation:
First, we are to enquire what
the true Church of Christ is. And
secondly, what is that governement


<pb n="52" facs="tcp:8160:33"/>
which Christ hath appointed over
every such Church.</p>
               <p>For the first: A true Church of
Christ is a congregation of true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers
men and women, who by
the Word of God preached, are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
from the world, and the
reigning lusts thereof, and declared
to be such by the open profession of
the true and right faith, and by the
conversation of Christian life con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
thereunto. Such is a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
visible true Church or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,
and so is (as farre as wee
can judge) a true branch of the holy
Catholique Church, which is invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
comprehending the number
of Gods Elect, and is apprehended
only by faith, &amp; not by sight. Now
every such particular Congregation
as aforesaid, consisting of professed
beleevers of the knowne truth of
God, according to which they frame
the course of their life and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,
is in it selfe an absolute


<pb n="53" facs="tcp:8160:33"/>
Church, whose onely Governor for
matters of faith, and the true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of God, is Iesus Christ. He it is
that as King reigneth in this congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
and in all the members ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
they acknowledge none other
Governor for matters of Religion,
but Christ onely. For herein stands
his kingly Office: and the Laws by
which this King reigneth, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verneth
his Church, is his written
Word. And his Vicegerent, by
whom Christ is alwayes present
with every one of his severall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations,
is the holy Ghost, which
who so hath not is none of Christs.<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Now having thus defined what
a true Church of Christ is, namely a
congregation professing the known
true faith, every member thereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
able in some measure to give a
reason of the maine points of faith,
and to make proofe of their profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
by walking in a holy course of
life: hence it appeares who they be


<pb n="58" facs="tcp:8160:34"/>
that are not admitted to bee mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of this congregation or church
of Christ, therein to participate of
the holy Sacrament, untill their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
and reformation; namely
all ignorant and prophane persons,
which neither beleeve a right, nor
live accordingly. For the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Christ is called the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of Saints,<note place="margin">Act. 26.</note> being sanctified by
faith in Christ, and by his word and
Spirit.</p>
               <p>The second thing is, to enquire
and consider how this Church of
Christ is to be governed. To finde
this out is no difficulty. First, sure
it is, that none but Christ is supreme
and immediate Lord, King, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor
of his Church, whether of
the Catholique, or of every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
church or congregation rightly
constituted (as aforesaid) so as no
power on earth hath any authority
to prescribe Lawes for the governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of this Church, whether for


<pb n="59" facs="tcp:8160:34"/>
doctrine or discipline, whether for
faith or worship, but onely Christ,
whose written Word and Law is
the onely rule of this government;
which Law all Princes (who are
therefore called <hi>Custodes utrius<expan>
                        <am>
                           <g ref="char:abque"/>
                        </am>
                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan> Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulae)</hi>
are bound by him, whose
Vicegerents they are, to see well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
both by Ministers and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
Here then wee will speake of
the Officers which Christ hath
appointed over every Christian con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation:
and those are either Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
or other officers of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
First for the Ministers, they are
called by sundry titles, as<note n="a" place="margin">Act. 20. Tit. 1. 5. 7.</note> Bishops
or Presbyters,<note n="b" place="margin">Eph. 4. 11.</note> Pastors and Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,<note n="c" place="margin">Luke. 1. 2. 2 Cor. 11. 23.</note>
Ministers,<note n="d" place="margin">Luk. 10. 7. 1 Cor. 3. 9. Act. 6. 4. Mat. 28. 20. Act. 20. 7. Mat. 20. 25, 26.</note> Labourers,
and the like. Their principall office
is to * pray to preach the word to
administer the Sacraments. And
these Ministers, however stiled in
Scripture, are all of equall authority,
not one over another, nor one over
many, nor many over one, each be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing


<pb n="56" facs="tcp:8160:35"/>
in his place &amp; peculiar congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
under Christ alone, as the
King of his Church, to whom he is
accountable:<note place="margin">Heb. 13. 17.</note> and under Christ, to
the civill Magistrate, as being a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
               <p>But here a question may be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,<note place="margin">Quest.</note>
whether a Synod of Ministers,
or of the churches, have not power
over any one Minister, and so over
all the Congregations, either to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
particular persons or congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
or to prescribe and impose or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
Rites, Canons, or the like?</p>
               <p>For answer:<note place="margin">Answ.</note> Some are of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that a Synod hath authoritie to
binde particular churches to such
rites as they shall prescribe and
impose. And they alledge that Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod
or assembly of the Apostles,<note place="margin">Act. 15.</note>
wherein were determined certaine
observances which they sent and
imposed on the churches of the new
convert Gentiles, as necessary for
them to observe, some wherof were


<pb n="57" facs="tcp:8160:35"/>
Iewish ceremonies. Hence they
conclude, That a Synod collected of
the churches, hath power over par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
churches, to ordaine and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
ceremonies as necessary to bee
observed. But this act of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
is no president or patterne for
succeeding ages. The reason is first,
because the Apostles were inspired
with the holy Ghost, which wholly
guided them in all matters of the
Church; so as in that their determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
they say expressely,<note place="margin">Act. 15. 28.</note> 
                  <hi>It seemed
good to the Holy Ghost and to us, to lay
upon you no greater burthen.</hi> Now
what Synod in any age after the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
could ever say, that they
were infallibly inspired and assisted
by the holy Ghost? If any can infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly
assure me hereof, that a Synod
after the Apostles cannot erre, but
that they can truly say, <hi>It pleased the
holy Ghost and us:</hi> then I will obey
all their Decrees.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That injunction of the


<pb n="58" facs="tcp:8160:36"/>
holy Ghost and of the Apostles was
but <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, for that present
time, for the avoyding of offences
betweene Iewes and Gentiles, who
in every city conversed together:
Which <hi>James</hi> the Apostle alledgeth
for the only reason of that determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.<note place="margin">Act. 15. 21.</note>
But we reade not in all the
writings of the Apostles afterward,
that they either ordained or impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the least rite or ceremonie to bee
observed in any of the Churches of
God; yea, they expressely condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
all such ordinances, as before is
shewed.</p>
               <p>But here another question ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth:
If particular congregations be
not subject to bee ruled by Synods,
or the like jurisdiction, what order
can be expected, or what meanes is
left for ordaining of Ministers over
every congregation?</p>
               <p>For answer, briefely: First for
order; What better or surer order
can be, than that which Christs


<pb n="59" facs="tcp:8160:36"/>
Word hath set down? And if in any
thing doubts arise in a Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
they have other congregations
with the Ministers to consult with.
For although every particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
be an absolute church, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
no jurisdiction over it but
Christs alone, and that immediatly;
yet it is not separated or divided
from the neighbour churches, so as
that it should not hold communion
with them, or a consociation, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating
together in all mutuall
offices of helpe, counsel, comfort, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
in doubts, advice in diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
and the like: this beeing the
priviledge and benefit of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of Saints, which is not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited
to one particular congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
onely within it selfe, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth
all the Members of the
Catholique church, wheresoever
they are visible in any assemblies: so
as if any one congregation fall into
an errour, it is by others to bee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monished


<pb n="60" facs="tcp:8160:37"/>
and conuinced, that it
may be reformed. If it fall into any
foule heresie (which yet is not easie
in a well constituted Church) it
must bee dealt withall accordingly
as the case shal require: the churches
assembled must labour to reduce it,
and if after all meanes it proove in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrigible,
when there is no reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
they must renounce communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with that congregation. And if
that congregation shall bee further
troublesome, in breaking the peace
of the Churches, or of the civil state,
it is liable to such punishments as
by the good lawes of the land are
allotted to such and such offences.
For although no power on earth
hath power over mens consciences
in matters of religion, yet God hath
in his ordinance set up civil powers
and Magistrates,<note place="margin">Rom. 13.</note> whom he hath ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
with authority to punish such
as doe openly transgresse either the
Lawes of God, or the just Lawes of


<pb n="61" facs="tcp:8160:37"/>
the civil state. For the Magistrate is
<hi>Gods Minister,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 14.</note> both <hi>for the punishment
of evill doers, and for the praise and
protection of them that doe well.</hi> And
for the better and more easie way
for the civill Power to take cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance
of things of that nature, it will
become the duty of all the churches,
in a Synod or otherwise to convince
the parties offending, and if obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
to complaine of them to the
civill Magistrate. Thus it is with a
congregation as it stands in relation
to other Churches, and in a subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the civill power.</p>
               <p>Now for a congregation consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
in it selfe, if a member therof
do offend in any kinde, what is to
be done, or who shall censure it? I
answer: If the offence bee against
the Law of Christ, or his governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
over that congregation, then
the same congregation hath power
given from Christ to censure the
Delinquent; when after all due


<pb n="62" facs="tcp:8160:38"/>
means he remains obstinate and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrigible;
as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. But if the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
be against the law of the civil
State, he is then punishable accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to that law, by the civill Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate.</p>
               <p>But here another question ariseth,
Whether the Minister or Pastor of
the congregation alone have power
of censure committed unto him, or
together with the congregation?</p>
               <p>I answer: Together with the
congregation; which therefore ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth
certaine officers, such as are
most eminent for integrity, gravity,
holinesse, knowledge, and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in matters of the congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to represent the congregation,
and to assist the Minister in govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and correction of manners:
And who fitter to take knowledge
of home-delinquents, than such as
best know them? And who are
likeliest to use mercy, compassion,
and moderation in such censures,


<pb n="63" facs="tcp:8160:38"/>
and better means of the delinquents
amendment, than such as are their
godly neighbours?</p>
               <p>And these officers, either for the
gravity of their yeares or manners,
are called Elders. The<note n="*" place="margin">D. Hall, in his Episcopacy by Divine right.</note> Prelats can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
endure the name of lay Elders;
but in Scripture we find them. For
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, an Elder, is taken both
for a Minister of the Word, and for
a Lay Elder, as they call it: as, 1 <hi>Tim.
5. 17. Let the Elders that rule well, bee
accounted worthy of double honor, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
they who labour in the Word and
doctrine.</hi> Where Elders plainly sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
both such as rule, and such as
preach, distinct one from the other.
So <hi>Rom. 12. 6, 7, 8. He that ruleth</hi> is a
distinct officer from him that tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
&amp; prophecieth. And so, 1 <hi>Cor.
12.</hi> 28. After Prophets or Teachers,
are set Helps, governments, or helps
in government, as our Translation
hath it. These Governors then sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
considered, were not Ministers


<pb n="64" facs="tcp:8160:39"/>
of the Word, but Lay men, as they
call them. We could produce some
Antients that speake of these lay go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors
or Seniors; but at present
for brevities sake wee omit them.
The antient Church of the Iewes
had such Elders, as we reade, called
Masters of the Synagogue, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 15.
And if antiently; in and after the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
time, there were not such
Elders, how came it to passe after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
under Antichrist, that the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of every particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
was delivered unto those
of the Laity, whom we call church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardens
and Side men, who are to
assist the Minister in matters of the
Church, though not in matter of
censure, which the Prelacy hath
wholly usurped and monopolized
to it selfe, having thrust out and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
exterminated, as much as in
them lieth, the very name and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of Lay Elders, had wee not
some records thereof in the lasting


<pb n="65" facs="tcp:8160:39"/>
monuments of the Scripture? Yea,
let the Prelates tell us, how all that
Lay Eldership (as I may call it) of
Chancellors, Commissaries, and the
rest, came to be set up, but to supply
(in some sort) those antient Lay El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
whom the Apostles had set up,
and whom Antichrist puld down,
as being the main hinderance of the
setting up of his Hierarchy? For
how had the Prelacie mounted to
that height of power over the
whole Church, had the Lay Elders
still continued in governing, with
godly Ministers, the several congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
respectively? So as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving
of the Lay Elders, and the
bringing in of Churchwardens and
other Lay Officers into the church,
all subject to the Prelates jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and made their sworne vassals,
was the very up-setting of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian
Throne in the Temple of
God. And this is that order of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
without which the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates


<pb n="66" facs="tcp:8160:40"/>
cry out, There is no order.
Whereas that order which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
left, in governing the Church
by Ministers ann Lay officers, is the
onely true Order. Those words of
Christ, <hi>Goe tell it to the Church,</hi> doe
shew, That censure of incorrigible
faults was in the power of every
Congregation. So 1 <hi>Cor. 5. 4, 5.
&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the second place, to the former
question concerning the ordaining
of Ministers in every congregation,
in case there be neither Diocesan
Bishops, nor Synods to perform it:
I answer, first, That most men doe
greatly mistake that here which
they call Ordination of Ministers.
The Romanists have scrued it up to
one of their seven Sacraments, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the Imposition of hands upon
the Priests head by the Prelate, to be
the outward signe of that inward
grace, which <hi>ex opere operato</hi> (as they
say) is conferred upon the Priest.


<pb n="67" facs="tcp:8160:40"/>
And even many Protestants are of
opinion, that Ordination cannot be
performed but by a Prelate, or at
least by Ministers onely, as without
whose imposition of hands it were
no Ordination, or as if it did confer
such an order. Whereas the prime
and proper conferring of this Order
is by Christ himselfe, inwardly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and gifting a man for the work
of the Ministry.</p>
               <p>Secondly then, what is that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
ordaining and appointing of
Ministers? and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the
Imposition of hands, which the
Scripture speakes of?</p>
               <p>I answer: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, signifying
properly a stretching out of the
hand, it was used either in lifting up
of the hands in token of sufferage in
election of officers, or in stretching
out of the hand upon the head of
the man chosen, for confirmation.
Also when it was used by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
it pleased God to bestow ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with


<pb n="68" facs="tcp:8160:41"/>
the gifts of the holy Ghost,<note place="margin">Act. 8. 17.</note> and
on some recovery of health.<note place="margin">Mar. 16. 18.</note> This
was very frequent in the Apostles
times: But afterwards in succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
ages there was no such gift an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed
to the laying on of hands. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
Therefore it was of use ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to its antient and ordinary
custome in sufferages in elections of
officers, to declare assent and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
of those for such and such
places, when after prayer hands
were layd on them.</p>
               <p>But by whom was this Impositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of hands used at the choice of
Ministers? I answer, By those who
gave their sufferages or votes to the
election; and those were sometimes
the congregation it selfe, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
others at their request joyning
with them: as we reade, <hi>Act. cap. 6.
5,</hi> 6. And all Ecclesiasticall stories
tell us, that antiently the election of
Ministers was by every congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
respectively. So as to them also


<pb n="69" facs="tcp:8160:41"/>
of right belonged the laying of their
hands, as a token of their approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and confirmation of him that
was so chosen to that office. And
though we reade in one place, That
the Apostle layd his hands upon <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy,</hi>
as 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 6. yet in another
we reade, (as 1 <hi>Tim. 4. 14.)</hi> that the
Presbyterie layd their hands upon
him. Which Presbyterie compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends
as well the Elders of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
as those of the Ministry. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly,
wee exclude not the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
or Ministers of other neighbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
congregations from joyning in
that worke, for assistance especially
in prayer, for a blessing upon the
new chosen Minister. For so farre
must we be from excluding any in
this kinde, that wee highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
consociation and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of gifts for assistance, where
it may be conveniently had. Onely
reserving to each congregation that
peculiar interest and right, which


<pb n="70" facs="tcp:8160:42"/>
every true Church of Christ hath in
chusing their owne Ministers, and
other Church officers.</p>
               <p>And this stands with good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:
for not onely antiquity both
in and from the Apostles times plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
for this, but even naturall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and equity. For reason willeth
that such as chuse should ratifie.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Those who give the
maintenance should chuse the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Who have commonly
better Ministers than those Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations,
that upon good advice and
counsell chuse them themselves.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Where is greater love
betweene Minister and people,
than where the liberty of such a
choyce is enjoyed.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, What vertue at any time
doth a Prelates imposition of hands
adde to Ministers so ordained by
him? Or what bee those Ministers
whom Prelates usually place over


<pb n="71" facs="tcp:8160:42"/>
the people? And I would aske any
reasonable Christian, whether hee
would not rather have the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation,
prayer, and imposition of
hands, of the poorest godly man,
than of the most glorious Prelate?
Yea, though hee were stiled even
Grace it selfe? For as <hi>James</hi> saith,
<hi>The effectuall fervent prayer of a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
man prevaileth much.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iam. 5. 16.</note> It is not

               <p>FOr answer in generall: First
in generall, it is agreeable to
good and approved examples
in Scripture, to make firme leagues
and faithfull Covenants for the
maintenance of the true faith and
religion of Christ. See for this,
2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. 12, 13. and Chapter

cap.</hi> 9. 38.</p>
               <p>Severally, in particular: It stands


<pb n="73" facs="tcp:8160:43"/>
both with Christian piety and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
for all the members of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Church or congregation, to
enter into a firme covenant among
themselves, to maintain a holy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
together in the profession
of the truth, and practise of a holy
life, as becommeth the communion
of Saints.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It stands with the like
Christian piety and prudence, to
hold a sweet and inviolable bond
and communion with all other
churches or congregations rightly
constituted, as we conceive, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to Christs ordinance, and wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
according unto it.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, If there be any Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Churches that doe in some small
circumstances differ from us, in that
forme of government which wee
conceive and beleeve Christ hath
set up in his Word, so as therein
they may seem to come short of that
exactnesse that is required, nor yet

not with-hold from them the

            <p>HAving thus freely and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
(though briefely, as
the present straits of time
would permit) declared what I
have and doe conceive and beleeve
concerning Christs kingdome, and
that forme and frame of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
thereof in his Church, as I
finde it recorded in the Scripture,
whereof I am in my conscience ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perswaded: as my earnest prayer
and trust is, That Christ by his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
and Word will leade his into all
truth necessary to salvation; so my
hope is, that however perhaps those
things which I have here delivered
according to the simplicity of my


<pb n="76" facs="tcp:8160:45"/>
conscience, will not so bee relished
of all, but that they wil seem bitter,
especially to the ignorant and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
minded, who savour not the
things of Christ: yet my confidence
is, that all the wise hearted and wel
affected to Iesus Christ (For,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 16. 22.</note> 
               <hi>If any

embrace Christs yoke, and to the
uttermost of their power labour to
advance his throne in all Churches;
or if that, through Sathans malice
cannot bee effected, yet that they
will set him up as sole Lord and
King over their owne soules, and so
will joyne in communion with all
those that doe or shall desire heere
to serve Iesus Christ according to
that purity of conscience which is
required in every true Christian (as
the Apostle professed of himselfe)<note place="margin">2 Tim. 1. 3.</note>
and in that way wherein the name


<pb n="77" facs="tcp:8160:45"/>
of Christ shall bee most magnified,
and his kingdome exalted heere on
earth.</p>
            <p>And this shall the better be done,
if a Law be made this present Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
that as Antichrists king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome

be cast out, so Christs kingdom may
bee freely set up in this kingdome,
while his people (even as many as
