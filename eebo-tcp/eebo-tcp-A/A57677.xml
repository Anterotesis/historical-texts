            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>IN my navigation through the large sea of Sir <hi>Walter Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh's</hi> Historie, I lighted, now and then, upon som shelvs and quick-sands, which made mee strike sail ever and anon, and cast anchor, and with the plummet of observation to sound the depth of those places; a few of which I here present to thy view, that thou maiest see wherein hee was either defective, or mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. There are divers other passages in his book, which deserv Animadversion, if I had time or leasure from my other Studies; onely take notice of this one, which now com's in my memorie. Hee undertake's to prove by three reasons that the Flood did
<pb facs="tcp:65785:3"/>
not utterly deface the marks of Paradise.</p>
            <p>[1. Becaus <hi>Moses,</hi> who lived long after, make's a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar <note place="margin">Lib. 1. cap. 3. § 5.</note> description of Paradise. 2. Becaus one of <hi>Seth's</hi> pillars was exstant long after the Flood. 3 Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus the trees were not rooted up by it, as appear's by the Olive branch brought by <hi>Noah's</hi> Dove] How feeble these reasons are, anie man, though weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sighted, may see. For 1. <hi>Moses</hi> his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular description of Paradise was from Tradition or Revelation, as all his other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relations of <hi>Genesis</hi> were, both before, and after the Flood; and not from anie vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible marks of Paradise after the Flood. Hee describe's particularly the Tree of Life in the midst of the Garden, with the Tree of Knowledg; will anie hence infer that these trees were exstant after the Flood? 2. To prove that Paradise was not quite defaced, becaus one of <hi>Seth's</hi> pillars was exstant after the Flood, is a weaker reason then the former: for these pillars were not set up in Paradise, nor by <hi>Adam,</hi> nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Fall; but without the Garden by <hi>Seth's</hi> posteritie about 900 years after the
<pb facs="tcp:65785:3"/>
Fall. His third reason, That the trees were not rooted up becaus of the Olive branch, is weakest of all; for were the trees no where in the World, but in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise? or was the Olive peculiar onely to that Garden? Surely these three Reasons are of less validitie then that of <hi>Irenaeus, Justin Martyr,</hi> and <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who would have Paradise exstant becaus <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noch</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> were there. But indeed Paradise was utterly defaced with the Flood, which rose fifteen cubits higher then the mountains. It's true that the place was not removed by the Flood, yet the beautie, delights, and form of it was utterly abolished, as a punishment of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam's</hi> sin. I could touch divers other pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages in his Book, but that I am imploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a greater voiage through the vast Ocean of Historie from the Second Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donian War, to these our Modern times; conteining all remarkable passages of these last two thousand years of the World; which voiage I hope to end in a shorter time then <hi>Drake</hi> did his, beeing almost within four hundred leagues of our own shore: in the interim make use of these Observations,
<pb facs="tcp:65785:4"/>
which I have caussed to bee printed in the same volume with the <hi>Epitome,</hi> that they may bee bound together. God grant that the end of all our labors may bee to glorisie Him, and to finde out the Truth, without which our knowledg is but ignorance, our light, darkness, and all our meditations, vexations of minde.

A conceit derogato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to God's Eternitie, and Infinitie, as if something which is not God should bee equal with him. <hi>Secondly</hi> it's repugnant to Scripture which affirm's all things to bee created by God. <hi>Thirdly</hi> it's
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65785:7"/>
against the nature of that light, which whether it bee a corporeal or spiritual substance, cannot bee eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, except it bee God, much less if it bee an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent which is alwaies <hi>posterior</hi> to the substance, but becaus at last Sr <hi>Walter</hi> retract's this opinion, I will saie no more of it.</p>

                  <hi>ARistotle</hi> calleth Light a qualitie inherent to a dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanous bodie, but this, saith Sir <hi>Walter,</hi> should bee rather a vouched of the heat]. <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed somtimes that Light, or <hi>Lumen</hi> (for <hi>Lux</hi> is that which is in the lucid bodie it self) is <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> of a diaphanous or transparent bodie. For Light is not the qualitie inherent in a solid, dens, or opac bodie; but in a diaphanous. And if there were not transparent bodies, there should bee no light at all; for the light wee see (or by which ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wee see) here in the aër, is not that which is in the bodie of the Sun, but the <hi>intentional species</hi> of that light. Therefore <hi>Aristotle</hi> was not in an error, but Sir <hi>Walter;</hi> who will have heat to bee the <hi>inherent qualitie of a diaphanous bodie;</hi> wheras solid and dens bodies are the proper subjects of heat intensive, and not diaphanous, which transmit it, except the dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanous bodie bee inclosed by solid bodies reverbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating the heat.</p>

there, or anie where els then in <hi>Armenia;</hi> and as for <hi>Noah's</hi> planting of his Vineyard in <hi>India,</hi> not in <hi>Armenia</hi> becaus this Countrie is too cold for Vines, is an opinion altogether groundless: For first, how knew hee that there were not as well in <hi>Armenia,</hi> as in <hi>India</hi> wilde Vines, for of those <hi>Noah</hi> made his Vineyard, by pruning, cultivating and dressing of them. 2.

It is not altogether the coldness of the Countrie that hinder's the growing of Vines, but the nature of the Soil, and manie times excessive heat is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment; so is the unseasonableness of the months of <hi>Julie</hi> and <hi>August</hi> by reason of too much rain that hinder's the maturation of the grapes: for <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Italie,</hi> which are fortie degrees in Northerlie Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude from the Line, being forth excellent wines, and yet New <hi>Spain</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> which is nearer the Line by twentie degrees produceth no wine, as <hi>Jos.

               <p>IT is thought that the name of Monie was not-heard in Greece, when <hi>Homer</hi> did write, who measure's the value of gold and brass by the worth of cattle, saying, That the golden armor of <hi>Glaucus</hi> was worth a hundred Beevs, &amp;c.] It is unlikelie that the name of Monie was not heard in Greece when <hi>Homer</hi> lived, whereas it was used in countries not far from Greece long before <hi>Homer:</hi> for <hi>Abimelech</hi> gave to <hi>Abraham</hi> a 1000 shekels as the Chaldee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth that place, or a 1000 didrachms, as the Greeks translateth it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 20. So wee read that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> bought for monie a Burial-place. It is not likelie then that in <hi>Homer's</hi> time, Greece beeing so flourishing a countrie, and having commerce with neighboring nations, should want the use of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, and although <hi>Homer</hi> speak's of a hundred Beevs, and not of Monie, yet hee may bee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood to have spoken of monie stamped with the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:65785:24"/>
image of an Ox: for at first the usual stamp upon monie was Cattle, hence <hi>pecunia à pecus:</hi> So <hi>Jacob's</hi> hundred Lambs, with which hee bought a plot of ground, <hi>Gen.</hi> 33. may bee meant of so manie pieces of silver, bearing the stamp of a Lamb; for monie is named from its stamp. So a hundred Angels si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifie so manie pieces of gold having their picture: the efore <hi>Bos</hi> doth not onely signifie an Ox, but also the coin that bear's the picture of the ox: hence was the proverb, <hi>Bos in linguâ,</hi> for one that was tongue tied, beeing corrupted with monie. And not onely was <hi>pecunia</hi> called so from the picture, but also from the skins of cattle; for monie ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was made of leather: And so wee may conceiv that Queen <hi>Dido</hi> encompassed the ground on which Carthage was to bee built, with an ox hide, that is with monie made of the ox hide: this kinde of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie was cascalled <hi>nummus scorteus</hi>

This cowardlie trick of self murther is more proper for women then men: and indeed wee finde in histories more women guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of this vice then men, as <hi>Lucretia, Cleopatra, Dido,</hi> and her sister <hi>Anna, Phyllis Amata</hi> the wife of <hi>Latinus, Iuturna</hi> the sister of <hi>Turnus; Sappho,</hi> the Lesbian; mad <hi>Jocasta,</hi> the daughter of <hi>Creon; Phaedra,</hi> the step-mother of <hi>Hippolitus; Dejanira,</hi> the wife of <hi>Hercules; Statyra,</hi> and <hi>Roxane,</hi> the sisters of <hi>Mithridates;</hi> the Lemnian Virgins who usually hanged themselvs, and multitudes more.

This cowardise of self-murther was so hated by the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, that they did not bestow on such the honor of burial: and the Lemnians used to drag the naked bodies of self-murtherers up and down the streets.

For is it like lie that before <hi>Alexander's</hi> time
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:65785:32"/>
yet before <hi>Baechus</hi> and <hi>Hercules,</hi> the Indian should have Ordnance, and neither the Persians their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors, nor <hi>Alexander,</hi> who went so far into the Indies, and who was so curious and ambitious of all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of arts, should be ignorant of this art of Artille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, so useful for his victories; and that the Romans, who extended their Trophees so far Eastward, should never mention this art, or know the use of it, who were so ingenious in all militarie engines. For what is spoken of <hi>Claudiana tonitrua,</hi> or <hi>Salmoneus</hi> his lightning and thundring, is nothing els but bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dishing of torches in the dark, and rumbling with stones or iron upon brass, which will make a hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous nois. Therefore doubtless this invention, which was never mentioned by anie antient writer, is not yet 300 years old, found out, as som saie, at <hi>Mentz,</hi> in Germanie, others in <hi>Phrisia;</hi> but I rather think it was found out in Italie, the land of all inventions: for I finde the Italians have been ever the most wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie people for invention in the world; and that besides shooting with guns, they have invented divers other waies of using gunpowder. Again, the word <hi>Archibugio</hi> a harquebush, is Italian, made up perhaps of <hi>Arco</hi> a bow, and <hi>buso</hi> a hole, or hollowness, becaus it is as a hollow bow, or a bow with a hole, out of which bullets are discharged, as darts flung from a bow. It is then more probable that guns is a late Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean invention: not Asiatic; for the Turks, more Easter; then Germanie, or Italie, knew not this art till they learn'd it of the Western Christians, and doubtless that Monk the Chymist, who found it out first, was either a Germane or rather an Italian living in Germanie, for the Germans are better for imitation then invention.</p>

               <p>I Think it was a great part of Rome's good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, that <hi>Alexander</hi> came not into Italie] I think it was rather <hi>Alexander's</hi> good fortune, for hee would have found great ods between Italian and Persian Armies: as good souldiers as <hi>Alexander</hi> have com into Italie, but they had better staied out of it. For neither <hi>Pyrrbus,</hi> nor <hi>Annibal</hi> got anie thing by their coming thither, they both indeed got victories, but they had better been without them; for <hi>Pyrrbus</hi> in his last victorie, having lost all the strength and flower of his Armie, cried out, That such another victorie would bee his undoing; so that hee was fain to leav Italie with loss: and when hee saw the valor and invincible courage of the Romans, whose dead carcasses laie on the ground, retaining threatnings in their countenance, and their swords in their hands, none of them having wounds but in his breast, hee cried out, O! how easie were it for mee conquer the whole world if I had such souldiers: and so little did hee trust to his own strength, when hee saw those unconquered spirits of the Romans, that though hee was victor, yet intreated for peace, which notwithstanding was denied him, &amp; a peremptorie command sent from the Senate, that hee should depart with all speed out of Italie. And victorious <hi>Hannibal</hi> confessed that hee had to do with souldiers (meaning the Romans) that were neither content with bad nor good fortune, for when they conquered, they prosecuted their victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; and when they were conquered, they renewed their forces: nay I may truly saie, that though the Romans were manie times beaten, yet they were never conquered, becaus like the giant <hi>Antaeus,</hi> the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:65785:33"/>
oftner they were flung to the ground, the greater strength they gathered. <hi>Alexander,</hi> who chased thousands of Persians like sheep before him, should have found one <hi>Horatiue Cocles</hi> who would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted him, and given check to his victories; and I believ, had hee seen <hi>Mutius Scaevola</hi> burn his own hand in the fire, hee would have as much adm red him as <hi>Porsenna</hi> did, and would have been glad with him to have made peace with the Romans. I doubt mee, if <hi>Alexander,</hi> for all his courage, would have rid into the firie gulf, to save his countrie from ruine, as <hi>Marcus Curtius</hi> did; or would his Macedons have devoted themselvs as the <hi>Fabii</hi> and <hi>Decii</hi> did. It is true that Sir <hi>Walter</hi> saie's, the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes were beaten by the Samnites, but hee should have remembred, that a Roman, taken from the plough, beat again the Samnites, and brought them into subjection. What undanted spirits had these men, when having lost all, and <hi>Annibal</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to enter at one of their gates, they were then bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie in sending an Armie away for Spain out of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gate. And when in the Punic War their Fleet was running away, they ran into the Sea, laid hold upon their ships, and brought them back: And who could have more courage then that Roman, who having received manie wounds, and lost both his hands, yet with his teeth so set upon his enemie, that hee bit off his nose, and both his ears. Or that Romane, who beeing left alone upon a rock in the British sea, and beset by manie Britains, hee killed and wounded manie of them, and at last leapt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the sea in his Armour, having flung away his target, and swam safe to <hi>Cesar,</hi> craving pardon for the loss of his target. Innumerable examples might bee brought of this sort, even of common souldiers, not to speak of their great commanders, the <hi>Fabii, Marcelli, Scipie's, Camilli, Cesars,</hi> and manie
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:65785:33"/>
others, the meanest of which migbt bee equalled to <hi>Alexander. Talibus viris, non labor insolitus, non locus ullus asper erat.

I believ the Gauls were as stout souldiers as ever the Macedons were; but what they got by their coming into Italie their posteritie will not brag of.</p>

               <p>THe Romanes entertain'd the proffer of those Mercenaries that were fled out of <hi>Sardinia</hi> and they denounced War against Carthage, under a shameless pretence, that the preparations made for Sardinia, were made against Rome it self] Sir <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> is too peremptorie in condemning this noble people of injustice: hee should have remembred that all Justice, and all Laws are not alike, nor of the same kinde; there are militarie laws (and yet just) repugnant to the civil law; there is a justice of dominion in Principalities and States, which among private men were injustice; it is an unjust thing to punish children for the father's offence, and yet it is justice in matter of treason: it is injustice
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:65785:35"/>
for a private man to entertain another man's fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive-servant, or a debtor, or a criminous person; &amp; yet it was not unjust for the Hebrews and the Romans to have their <hi>Asyla,</hi> Sanctuaries, or places of Refuge for such. It is not lawful for private men to carrie away maids violently and marrie them; yet it was lawful in the Romans to do so to the Sabine Virgins, beeing necessitated thereto, for the uniting of these two nations, and the avoiding of bloodshed. A private widow may lawfully marrie; but not always the widow of an Emperor or King, becaus by such marriages, the peace of the Kingdom or Empire may bee endangered. That which in other governments is tolerable, was not tolerated in the Athenian Democracie; among whom it was lawful, by their <hi>Ostracism,</hi> to banish anie person more eminent than another in virtue or wealth; becaus the presence of such a man might endanger their peace, and form of government; neither should a wise man take it ill, to bee banished even for his excellencie, so long as his banishment tend's to the common good, which hee should prefer to his own private interest. The bodie natural is better'd somtime by Phleboto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, and the tree by the loss of som branches. It is certain that the safetie of the people is the Supreme Law, and therefore it was no injustice in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans to accept of Sardinia, beeing invited thither both by the Carthaginian Mercenaries, and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives. For it was lawful for them to undertake the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the miserable; but such were the Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginian subjects, who endured an insupportable sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verie under their tyrannical yoke; whereas the Romane government was much more gentle and milde. Again, the Romans knew (notwithstanding there was a League between them and Carthage) how maliciously that citie was bent against Rome, envying her rising glorie, and laboring by all
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:65785:35"/>
means to suppress it when anie opportunitie presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it self, though at this time shee could not, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much weakned by her Mercinaries, and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious subjects. It had been madness therefore in Rome to suffer so potent, so malitious, and so faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less a citie as Carthage, to seat herself in Sardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia so near them; who, upon all occasions, would have been readie to cut the Roman's throats: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was both prudence in them to prevent such a mischief, and justice towards their subjects to keep under their enemies, and to observ their old Rule, <hi>Nè quid Respublica detrimenti capiat.</hi> It's true that the wrong don by Carthage, upon the Roman Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, was satisfied in respect of their goods, but the Romans did not know that their Merchants were drowned by the Carthaginians, till after the peace was made; therefore in this regard they had reason to seiz upon Sardinia. I know that the Romans did not alwaies help those that implored their help after this manner, for when the Campanians sought their aid against the Samnites, they were refused, becaus the Samnites were their old and true friends, therefore the Romans would not force them by arms, but entreat them by their Legats to abstain from wronging the Campanians. But the case was otherwise with Carthage, which never was a true friend to Rome, but still emulous of her greatness, and still laboring to bring her under, and her power was to bee feared, whereas the Samnites had not that power to hurt the Romans, which Carthage had. Again, if the Romans had been base, as Sir <hi>Walter</hi> would have them, they would have accepted of the proffer of Sardinia, when Carthage was in so low a condition, that shee was resdie to bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered up to the Mercenaries, which they generous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refused, and gave assistance to Carthage, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting their Merchants to carrie anie he por pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:65785:36"/>
to the Carthaginian rebells, as <hi>Polybius l.</hi> 1. shew's. But Sir <hi>Walter</hi> saith that this courtesie of the Romans proceeded from hope they had that Carthage either would have submitted to them, or els to the Rebells: but I wonder how hee came to know the Roman's minde so well, seeing <hi>Polybius,</hi> out of whom hee hath the historie, speak's no such thing, nor doth hee give them that ill language that S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Walter</hi> doth, (which ill beseem's an historian) but hee still mention's them with great respect, which wee ought all to do, seeing God used them as instruments to free us from barbatism, and to cultivate us with knowledg and civilitie: besides, <hi>Dio Diaconus, Orofius,</hi> and <hi>Victor</hi> witness that Sat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinia was the Romans, not extorted by fraud, but yielded by the League made with <hi>Luctatius.</hi> Again, <hi>Florus</hi> tell's that <hi>serpente bello,</hi> during the war Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinia was annexed to the Empire. Lastly the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginian Embassadors confess to <hi>Scipio</hi> that they had unjustly broken the peace with Rome.</p>

               <p>NOt onely the Prophesies of <hi>Sibyl,</hi> wherein CHRIST was so plainly shewed, but even the books of <hi>Hermes</hi> are no better then counterfeit
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:65785:39"/>
pieces; entertain'd at first by the undiscreet zeal of such as delighted to see Christian Religion strengthned with forrain proofs] The first I finde, who question'd these Prophesies of <hi>Sibyl,</hi> concerning Christ, was <hi>Celsus</hi> the enemie of Christ. I finde them here questioned by Sir <hi>Walter</hi> out of <hi>Casaubon;</hi> but why they should bee questioned, I finde no reason, but onely becaus Idolatrie was advanced in Rome, by the books of <hi>Sibyl.</hi> This is a weak reason, for though the <hi>Sibyls</hi> had been Idolaters themselvs, wee have no more caus to suspect their Prophesies of CHRIST, then the Prophesie of <hi>Balaam</hi> who was an Idolater, and yet none of the true prophets did speak more cleerly of Christ then hee did: Becaus Satan is the Autor of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, shall wee therefore reject his testimonie of CHRIST, when hee acknowledgeth him to bee the Son of GOD; or question that piece of Scripture? But to mee it seem's strange, that men of judgment should think those Oracles of the <hi>Sibyls</hi> to bee soisted in, or forged by Christians, seeing they are mentioned by <hi>Tullie,</hi> and <hi>Varro,</hi> who were dead before Christ was born. <hi>Tullie</hi> speak's of these Acrostics which contein the letters of our Saviour's name; and <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. 2. de divinats</note> shew's, that <hi>Sibyl</hi> was not out of her minde when shee made them. Hee speak's of a certain King, mentioned in <hi>Sibyl's</hi> verses, by whom the Romans must bee saved. Besides, how could anie Christian insert these prophesies into the <hi>Sibyl's</hi> books, which as <hi>Suetonius in vitâ Octav.</hi> saith, were so carefully kept by <hi>Augustus,</hi> that hee laid them up in two gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den cabinets in <hi>Apollo's</hi> Temple. And what im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudencie had it been in Christians, to foist in such Oracles into <hi>Sibyl's</hi> books; for in the time of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin Martyr,</hi> and <hi>Lactantius,</hi> who set down these Oracles, the books of <hi>Sibyl</hi> were generally known,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:65785:40"/>
and copies of them everie where; so that such a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerie could not but bee known, and it had been both a confirmation of Gentilism, and a weakning of the Christian Caus, when it should have been known that they supported their Religion with such forgeries: and it had been a vain thing for Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to confute the Gentiles, who rejected our Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures by their own Oracles, if there had been none such to bee found in their <hi>Sibyl's</hi> books. <note n="b" place="margin">See Just'n Mart. Origen; Lactan. Clem. Alex. Austin. &amp;c.</note> Again, the Emperor's finding that the Christians had made use of those books to confute their Idolatrie, and that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Gentiles, by this means were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, they commanded that none should read those books under pain of death. And indeed wee read that <hi>Secundianus, Vecianus,</hi> and <hi>Marcellinus</hi> the Orator were converted to Christianitie, by reading the fourth Eclogue of <hi>Virgil,</hi> which hee took out of the <hi>Sibyl's</hi> books: and therefore it stood with the wisdom of God, to use the testimonie of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenish Oracles against themselvs, and to beat them with their own weapons, to make them inexcusable. And no less vanitie is it, to question the writings of <hi>Hermes,</hi> or <hi>Mercurius Trismegistus,</hi> so called for his great learning; or from the knowledg hee had of the Trinitie; who for his admirable learning, was worshipped as a god among the Egyptians: I saie, to question his writings, which have been received from age to age, and so often cited by ancient, and modern, Heathenish, and Christian writers, and give no reason why they should bee question'd or suspected, argue's vanitie and self conceit; for so wee may question anie thing that hath been written, and so all men must becom doubtful Academicks. I know the age in which hee lived may bee questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, som making him no older then <hi>Diogenes,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers more antient then <hi>Moyses,</hi> which is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:65785:40"/>
becaus hee is by som said to bee the son, by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers the scribe of <hi>Saturn,</hi> and the first that taught the Egyptians knowledg by Writing; in all which learning of the Egyptians <hi>Moyses</hi> was skilful: but to question his doctrine without anie ground, is not allowable.</p>

               <p>I Am persuaded that this inscription <hi>Simoni de san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cto,</hi> was by som bad Criticism taken amiss, in place of <hi>Semoni Sango</hi>] Here Sir <hi>Walter</hi> will not believ that there was ever at Rome anie Altar erected to <hi>Simon Magus;</hi> becaus <hi>Suetonius, Tacitus, Dion,</hi> and <hi>Seneca</hi> make no mention of it. I would know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther these mention all the Altars, Temples, or Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors that were given in Rome to each particular god, which almost were numberless. Shall wee saie, that there were no more gods, sacrifices altars, and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples then what they mention, wee should finde but verie few in Rome; but what if these have not mentioned this honor, yet manie grave and learned Autors have for their sakes, then wee may credit it, till wee know the contrarie. The Roman Histories make no mention of <hi>Simon Magus</hi> at all, nor of his Concubine <hi>Helena,</hi> or <hi>Selene,</hi> nor of his damnable doctrines; shall wee therefore conclude there were no such persons or doctrines in those times. Yet <hi>Dio Chrys. orat.</hi> 21. speak's of one (whom hee name's not) who was entertained by <hi>Nero,</hi> for promising hee would flie in the aër. And <hi>Suetonius</hi> relate's of one, who like <hi>Icarus</hi> would needs flie, but hee fell, and bespattered <hi>Nero's</hi> chamber, or his pavillion, or chair of state with his blood. Now that this was <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> all the Christian Historians do agree. And surely <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> and likewise <hi>Justin Martyn</hi> in his Oration to <hi>Antonius</hi> the Emperor, and <hi>Tertullian</hi>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:65785:41"/>
in his second Apologetic had been vcrie impudent, to accuse the Romans of such gross Idolatrie, in ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting an Altar to <hi>Simon Magus</hi> if it had been no such thing: it had been easie for the Emperors to have refuted this lie. As for the conceit of <hi>Semani Sango</hi> it is vain, for <hi>Justin Martyr in Apol ad Anton. pium</hi> sheweth, that hee, to whom the Altar was erected on the bank of <hi>Tibris</hi> between the two bridges, was a Samaritan, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> born in a village called <hi>Gitton.</hi> But <hi>Sangus</hi> was a <hi>Sabean,</hi> and the first King of that Nation, as St <hi>Austin lib.</hi> 18. <hi>de Civit.</hi> sheweth; from whom, or as others think, from his son <hi>Saba,</hi> the <hi>Cures</hi> were called <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beans.</hi> And as <hi>Romulus,</hi> the first King of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans; so <hi>Sangus,</hi> the first King of the Sabeans, were honored at Rome in the Palace: <hi>Sangus</hi> having his Chappel over against the Chappel of <hi>Quirinus,</hi> as <hi>Livie lib.</hi> 8. sheweth: and it had been absurd to erect an Altar to <hi>Sangus,</hi> with this inscription <hi>Semoni Sango;</hi> for <hi>Semones</hi> were the pettle gods of Rome, called <hi>Dii minorum gentium à seminibus,</hi> becaus they had care of Seeds; as <hi>Priapus</hi> was one of their <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mones:</hi> so that they had not merit enough to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance them to heaven. But <hi>Sangus,</hi> as well as <hi>Romu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> were gods of a higher degree; and if wee will believ <hi>Festus, Sangus</hi> is all one with <hi>Hercules,</hi> who is called <hi>Sangus; Sancus,</hi> or <hi>Sanctus, à sanciendis foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deribus;</hi> and so it seem's by <hi>Propertius lib.</hi> 4 <hi>Eleg.</hi> 10. in these verses.</p>

               <p>— OF him <hi>Daniel</hi> gave this judgment, <hi>In his place shall start up a vile person, unworthie the honor of a King,</hi> Dan. 11. ver. 2] Here again Sir <hi>Walter</hi> is mistaken, in saying that these words were spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of <hi>Seleucus,</hi> the eldest son of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they are spoken of <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> the younger brother of <hi>Seleucus;</hi> for hee was a most vile man if wee look upon his sacrileges, his injustice, and crueltie in murthering innocent persons; his le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitie, and seurril carriage, recorded by Historians; and therefore unworthie of a Kingdom, though his flatterers called him <hi>Epiphanes,</hi> that is <hi>Illustrious;</hi> whereas hee was more justly styled <hi>Epimanes,</hi> a <hi>mad inconsiderate wretch:</hi> This is hee that came in peaceably, and obteined the Kingdom by flatteries, <hi>Dan.</hi> 11. 21. for hee cheated young <hi>Demetrius,</hi> his brother <hi>Seleucus's</hi> son, and deluded the people, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them believ that hee aimed not at the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but at the tuition of the young King. <hi>With the arms of a flood shall they bee overthrown from before him, and they shall bee broken, yea also the Prince of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</hi> Dan. 11. 22. that is, they that opposed him shall bee destroied by the force of his armes, as with a floud, even his brother <hi>Seleucus,</hi> who made covenant with him to invade <hi>Egypt,</hi> upon pretence of assisting <hi>Pyscon</hi> against <hi>Ptolomes Philometor.</hi> In the
