            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>teenth of <hi>January, 1647.</hi> entituled, <hi>Declaration of the Kingdom of Scotland, concerning the KINGS MAJESTIES Perſon.</hi> Which being now taken into conſideration, The Eſtates of Parliament do find and Declare, That it was carried on, and concluded by a prevalent party, againſt the judgement of many of his <hi>Majeſties</hi> Loyal Subjects; And that it is a moſt ſinful, diſloyal, and unworthy Act, contrary to the will and commandment of GOD; contrary to all Laws, Divine and Humane; contrary to the Duty and Allegiance of Subjects; contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to all the rules of Juſtice, Honour, Gratitude and Humanity; and highly reflecting on the honour of this ancient Kingdom, and the reputation of his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Majeſties</hi> good Subjects therein. And therefore the <hi>KINGS MAJESTIE,</hi> with advice and conſent of His Eſtates of Parliament, doth hereby Annuall and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the ſame for ever: And ordains it to be expunged out of all Records, and never to be remembred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, but with due abhorrence and deteſtation.</p>
            <p>And the Eſtates of Parliament, conceiving themſelves obliged in conſcience, to make the truth of this buſineſs, and the manner of the carrying of it, known to the World, for the juſt vindication of this Kingdom, and His <hi>Majeſties</hi> Dutyfull and Loyal Subjects, who otherwiſe may ſeem to be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended and concluded in it. They do therefore, from their certain knowledge, declare, That even in that Parliament, (from which many of his <hi>Majeſties</hi> good Subjects were debarred, for their affection and adherence to His <hi>Majeſties</hi> ſervice and commands) there was a conſiderable number of worthy Patriots, of all Eſtates, who, at the paſſing of that baſe Act, gave a publick teſtimony and diſaſſent from it. Which is here recorded for their due honour; And for which their memory will in all ages re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a famous celebration; And that there were divers others, who, upon the pretexts of Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and aſſurances of the ſafety of His <hi>Majeſties</hi> Perſon, being inveigled, were in the ſimplicity of their hearts drawn along for the time; But ſhortly thereafter, being convinced of their error, did embrace the firſt opportunity to expiate the ſame, by freely hazarding their lives and fortunes in the year <hi>1648.</hi> to redeem His <hi>Majeſty</hi> from theſe reſtraints and dangers, which by that impious Act He was driven into. And therefore, His <hi>Majeſty,</hi> with advice and conſent foreſaid, doth Declare, that the Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment foreſaid, of the ſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>teenth of <hi>January, 1647.</hi> is not to be look'd upon as the Deed of the Kingdom, but as the Act of a few diſloyal and ſeditious perſons, who, having upon ſpecious, but falſe pretences, ſcrewed themſelves into the Government; did, by force of Arms, keep the ſame; And from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of their own guiltineſs, being afraid of the juſtice of His <hi>Majeſties</hi> Government, did violently carry on that Act. And in further owning thereof, did in the ſaid year <hi>1648.</hi> riſe in Arms, in oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to thoſe who endeavoured to reſtore His <hi>Majeſtie</hi> to His Government, and to relieve Him from the impriſonment and hazard he was then lying under, as the natural effects of that unworthy tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo juſtly hereby condemned.</p>
            <p>And for the further clearing of the ſence of this Kingdom, as to that baſe and treacherous act, and the aſperſions, which have been thereupon raiſed as if there had been previous Tranſactions and Bargains of money for carrying on of the ſame, The Eſtates of Parliament declare, They do abominate the very thought of any ſuch thing; and that if at any time hereafter, there ſhall be diſcovery of any ſuch wickedneſs (which they are confident GOD Almighty will in His Iuſtice bring to light, (if it be true) and wherein they earneſtly entreat the concurrence of all His <hi>Majeſties</hi> dutyful and loyal Subjects) The perſons guilty therof, ſhall with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mercy be purſued as the vildeſt of Traitors, and ſhall be incapable of the benefit of any Act of Pardon, Oblivion, or Indempnity for ever.</p>
