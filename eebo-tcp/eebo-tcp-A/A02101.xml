            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The bookes that were not long ago set forth, concerning Conie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catching and crosse-biting, and the discouerie of each (if anie sparke of grace were) might haue beene so manie restraints
<pb facs="tcp:19091:3"/>
and bridles to call them from that abominable life, but they that are giuen ouer to their owne hearts lust, with all their might inueigh both against them and their Authour.</p>
            <p>I haue therefore, Gentlemen, as one inforced (<hi>amore patriae</hi>) taken in hand to publish this little Pamphlet (which by a very friend came by a chance to my hands, and adding somewhat of mine owne knowledge, and vpon verie credible informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) most necessarie in my mind for the good of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, both for all men to see, what grosse villanies are now practised in the bright Sunne-shine, that thereby they may be forewarned to take heede how they conuerse with such cosoning companions: as also a iust checke and controll to such wicked liuers, that they perceiuing their goodnesse set abroch, may with remorse and penitencie forsake their abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable course of life, and betake them to a more honest and ciuill behauiour. If any with the spider heere seeke to sucke poison, let such a one take heede, that in practising his villany he chaunce commence Bachelor in Whittington Colledge, and so in good time take his degrees and proceede Doctor, and thence with a solemne procession take possession of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Stories</hi> cappe; to which some of the worshipfull compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of Conicatchers haue worthily heretofore attained.</p>
            <p>In this Treatise (louing countrimen) you shall see what shifts this crue of helhounds haue put in practise since the bookes of Conicatching came forth vnder these names. viz. <hi>The Art of Humoring. The Art of carrying stones; W. St Lift. Ia. lame. Ned Br. catch,</hi> and <hi>Blacke Robins kindnesse:</hi> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in are manifested the nature of Humorists, such as can insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate themselues into euerie mans companie: &amp; as they see him addicted, so will they verse vpon him, what policies they haue to purloine goods out of shops vnder the pretence of plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, what shifts they haue to cosen poore Alewiues, by the art of carrying stones, what inconuenience may come by fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing slattering strumpets, I know not I what should be the cause why so innumerable harlots and Curtizans abide about London, but because that good lawes are not looked vnto: is there not one appointed for the apprehending of such hell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moths,
<pb facs="tcp:19091:3"/>
that eat a man out of bodie &amp; soule? And yet there be more notorious strumpets &amp; their mates about the Citie and the suburbs, then euer were before the Marshall was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: idle mates I meane, that vnder the habit of a Gentleman or seruing man, think themselues free from the whip, although they can giue no honest account of their life. I could wish, and so it is to be wished of euery honest subiect, that <hi>Amasis</hi> lawe were receiued, who ordained that euerie man at the yeares end should giue an account to the Magistrate how hee liued, and he that did not so, or could not make an account of an honest life to be put to death as a fellon, without fauor or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don: What then should become of a number of our vpstart gallants, that liue only by the sweate of other mens browes, and are the decay of the sorwardest Gentlemen and best wits? Then should we haue fewer conicatching strumpets, who are the verie causes of all the plagues that happen to this flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing common wealth. They are the destruction of so manie Gentlemen in England. By them many Lordships come to ruine. What dangers growe by dallying with such vnchast Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertines, and what inconuenience followes by their inordinat Pleasures, let those that haue had wofull experience and mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Surgeon together testifie: nay, they not onely indanger the bodie by lothsom diseases, but ingraue a perpetuall shame in the forehead of the partie, and finally consume his soule and make him fit for the diuell.</p>
            <p>To leaue these base companions (that can by no wholsom counsell, nor aduised perswasions bee disswaded from their lothsom kind of lise, nor called to any honest course of liuing) in the dregges of their dishonesty. Would it please the hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and worshipfull of the land to take order for the cutting off of these cosoners, and consuming cankers of this common wealth, they should not only cause a blessing to be powred on this flourishing state, but haue the prayers of euery good sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect for their prosperous health: and welfare. And thus Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, I conclude with this farewell: God either conuert or confound such base companions.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here hath béene of late daies pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished two merrie and pithie Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets of the arte of Conicatching: wherin the Author hath sufficiently expressed his experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, as also his loue to his Countrie. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse with the Authors leaue, I will ouerlooke some lawe tearmes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in the first part of Conicatching: whereunto, as the Author saith, is necessarilie required thrée parties: <hi>The set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the Verser, and the Barnacle.</hi> Indéed I haue heard some retainers to this ancient trade dispute of his procéedings in this case, and by them in a full Synode of quart pots it was thorowlie examined and concluded, that there were no such names, as he hath set downe, nor anie cheating Arte so christened as Conicatching. Marie, in effect there is the like vnderhand traffique daylie vsed and experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced among some fewe start vp Gallants disperst about the suburbs of London, who tearmes him that drawes the fish to the bait, the <hi>Beater,</hi> and not the <hi>Setter:</hi> the Tauerne where they go, the Bush, and the foole so caught, the Bird. As for Conicatching, they cleape it <hi>Batfowling,</hi> the wine the <hi>Strap,</hi> and the cards the <hi>Limetwigs.</hi> Now for the compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of a woodcocke to worke on, and the fetching him into the wine bench of his wracke, is right beating the bush. The good asse is he will be dealt vpon, stouping to the lure if he be so wise as to kéep aloofe, a Haggard: and he whom
<pb facs="tcp:19091:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
he makes Verser the Reiciuer, and the Barnacle the <hi>Pothunter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But all this breakes no square, so long as we concurre <hi>in eodem subiecto:</hi> yet I wish, that as he hath looked into these wicked actions opened therein, so he had also looked into other grosse sinnes, which are séeded in the hearts of sundrie persons. Extortion had béene a large theame to haue wrought vpon: and with the Usurers bagges full of gold he might haue handled another pretie Treatise: He might haue brought forth Justice weying bread, and the Baker putting his eares in the ballance to make euen weight. He should haue personated the Thames most piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully complaining, what monstrous hauocke the Brew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers make of her water, without all remorse or compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and how they put in willowe leaues and broome buds into their woort in steed of hoppes. So likewise a Christian exhortation to mother Bunch would not haue done amisse, that she should not mixe lime with her Ale, to make it mightie, or cozen the Quéenes liege people of their drink, by fubbing them off with these <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But this was Doctor <hi>Pinchbackes</hi> drift, hee thought to haue shifted the Gentleman off by this extraordinarie imposition, thinking he would rather haue surceased his sute, then anie waie haue suffered him to sée his wife naked. In conclusion a chamber was prepared warme and close, in which she shewed her selfe, &amp; twise walked vp and down the chamber naked in the presence of M. Doctor and her husband, who demanded M. Doctors answer to his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer question, which was as followeth: Quoth he, from meward it is a boy, and to me ward it is a girle: other answer they could get none of him. Wherefore the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman was greatly offended against him, calling him Asse, Dolt, Patch, Cockescombe, Knaue, and all the base names he could deuise. But awaie went maister Doctor as skilfull in those cases as a blind man when he throweth his staffe: and durst not answer the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man one word. And the Gentleman greatly repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him that he had been so foolish to shew his wife in that sort before so sottish a companion.</p>
            <p>About foure dayes after the Gentlewoman fell in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and was deliuered of a boy and a girle: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at the Gentleman remembring the blunt answer of the Doctor, and finding it to be true, was greatly asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, supposing indéed hee had mightily wronged the Doctor: to whom he went immediately crauing par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for his former follie, shewing himselfe verie sorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for his fault, and offered him in recompence of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends all the fauour he might possibly doe him, gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to him his house at commandement, and his boord for so long time as he would continue with him. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon in signe of loue and amitie he went and soiour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at the Gentlemans house: Whereupon the Doctors

credit still more and more began to increase, so that all the countrie round about told no small tales of the great running of Doctor <hi>Pinchbacke,</hi> to whom they resorted early ano late.</p>
            <p>It fortuned soone after shere was a Faire neere to the Gentlemans house, where the people diuersly tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked of the Doctors skill and cunni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>, and that he could doe anie thing, or tell anie thing that was done in anie place. Naie (quosh a plaine Countriman) I will ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture twentie Nobles that hee shall not doe it. I will my selfe goe personally to him, and hold something in my hand, and if hee tell me what it is I will lose my money. I take you, sayd one or two, and the wager be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing layd, awaie they went towards the Gentlemans house: and passing thorough a meadow, the man tooke vp a Grashopper out of the grasse, and put it into his hand, so close that no man might perceiue it. Then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward they went, and met with Maister Doctor, and they desired him to satis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>, to tell them what one of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie held in his hand. Whereunto the Doctor was loth to answer, considering he had no such skill as peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple bruted abroade: neuer the lesse he cast in his mind, how he might excuse the matter by some pretie sleight, if he should guesse amisse, and therfore concluded in this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>st, he called to mind that his owne name was <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopper,</hi> and if (quoth he) I take him by the hand, I may say hee hath a grashopper in his hand, and yet I may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Whereat the Cuntrimen wondred, and went their wayes. Some said hee was but a cosoning knaue: others reported what wonders hee could perfor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>The Doctour about a moucth after desired the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman for his wiues portion, which the Gentleman willingly paid him. When two or three dayes were passed he told the Gentleman hee would goe into <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

The Gentleman was verie vnwilling to leaue the D<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors companie; but séeing the Doctor so importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, at last yéelded, and so lent the Doctor and his boy two of his best geldings: who as soone as they were on horsebacke, neuer minding to returne againe, tooke their iourney into Deuonshire, and there so long as his foure hundred pounds lasted made merie with their companions, till at last hauing spent all, beganne to renue his olde trade, and after being taken in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie with some suspected persons was apprehended, and by the law (as I heard) was condemned to bee hanged for a murtherer.</p>
